<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-1"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/">Amazon</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> is making its largest outside investment in its three-decade history as it looks to gain an edge in the artificial intelligence race.&nbsp;</p><p>The tech giant said it will spend another $2.75 billion backing Anthropic, a San Francisco-based startup that's widely viewed as a front-runner in generative artificial intelligence. Its foundation model and chatbot Claude competes with OpenAI and ChatGPT.</p><p>The companies announced an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/25/amazon-to-invest-up-to-4-billion-in-anthropic-a-rival-to-chatgpt-developer-openai.html">initial $1.25 billion investment</a> in September, and said at the time that Amazon would invest up to $4 billion. Wednesday's news marks Amazon's second tranche of that funding.</p><p>Amazon will maintain a minority stake in the company and won't have an Anthropic board seat, the company said. The deal was struck at the AI startup's last valuation, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/21/openai-rival-anthropic-in-talks-to-raise-750-million-funding-round.html">which was $18.4 billion</a>, according to a source.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past year, Anthropic closed five different funding deals worth about $7.3 billion — and with the new Amazon investment, the total exceeds $10 billion. The company's product directly competes with OpenAI's ChatGPT in both the enterprise and consumer worlds, and it was founded by ex-OpenAI research executives and employees.</p><p>News of the Amazon investment comes weeks after Anthropic <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/04/google-backed-anthropic-debuts-claude-3-its-most-powerful-chatbot-yet.html">debuted</a> Claude 3, its newest suite of AI models that it says are its fastest and most powerful yet. The company said the most capable of its new models outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4 and <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-5"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/">Google</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span>'s Gemini Ultra on industry benchmark tests, such as undergraduate level knowledge, graduate level reasoning and basic mathematics.</p><p>"Generative AI is poised to be the most transformational technology of our time, and we believe our strategic collaboration with Anthropic will further improve our customers' experiences, and look forward to what's next," said&nbsp;Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of data and AI at AWS cloud provider.</p><p>Amazon's move is the latest in a spending blitz among cloud providers to stay ahead in the AI race.&nbsp;And it's the second update in a week to Anthropic's capital structure. Late Friday, bankruptcy filings showed crypto exchange FTX struck a deal with a group of buyers to sell the majority of its stake in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/21/openai-rival-anthropic-in-talks-to-raise-750-million-funding-round.html">Anthropic</a>, confirming a CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/22/anthropic-lining-up-a-new-slate-of-investors-ruled-out-saudi-arabia.html">report</a> from last week.</p><p>The term generative AI entered the mainstream and business vernacular seemingly overnight, and the field has exploded over the past year, with a record $29.1 billion invested across nearly 700 deals in 2023, according to PitchBook. OpenAI's ChatGPT first showcased the tech's ability to produce human-like language and creative content in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has said <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/06/openai-announces-more-powerful-gpt-4-turbo-and-cuts-prices.html">more than 92%</a> of Fortune 500 companies have adopted the platform, spanning industries such as financial services, legal applications and education.</p><p>Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services don't want to be caught flat-footed.</p><p>It's a symbiotic relationship. As part of the agreement, Anthropic said it will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also use Amazon chips to train, build and deploy its foundation models. Amazon has been designing its own chips that may eventually compete with <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-9"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/">Nvidia</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span>.&nbsp;</p><p><span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-10"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/">Microsoft</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> has been on its own spending spree with a high-profile investment in OpenAI. Microsoft's OpenAI bet has reportedly jumped to <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/01/24/whos-getting-the-better-deal-in-microsofts-10-billion-tie-up-with-chatgpt-creator-openai/" target="_blank">$13 billion</a> as the startup's valuation has topped $29 billion. Microsoft's Azure is also OpenAI's exclusive provider for computing power, which means the startup's success and new business flows <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/microsofts-complex-bet-on-openai-brings-potential-and-uncertainty.html">back </a>to Microsoft's cloud servers.</p><p>Google, meanwhile, has also backed Anthropic, with its own deal for Google Cloud. It agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic, comprising a $500 million cash infusion, with another $1.5 billion to be invested over time. Salesforce is also a backer.</p><p>Anthropic's new model suite, announced earlier this month, marks the first time the company has offered "multimodality," or adding options like photo and video capabilities to generative AI.</p><p>But multimodality, and increasingly complex AI models, also lead to more potential risks. Google recently took its AI image generator, part of its Gemini chatbot, offline&nbsp;after users discovered<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/26/googles-gemini-ai-picture-generator-to-relaunch-in-a-few-weeks.html"> historical inaccuracies</a>&nbsp;and questionable responses, which circulated widely on social media.</p><p>Anthropic's Claude 3 does not generate images. Instead, it only allows users to upload images and other documents for analysis.</p><p>"Of course no model is perfect, and I think that's a very important thing to say upfront," Anthropic co-founder Daniela Amodei told CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/04/google-backed-anthropic-debuts-claude-3-its-most-powerful-chatbot-yet.html">earlier this month</a>. "We've tried very diligently to make these models the intersection of as capable and as safe as possible. Of course there are going to be places where the model still makes something up from time to time."</p><p>Amazon's biggest venture bet before Anthropic was electric vehicle maker <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-15"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RIVN/">Rivian</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span>, where it invested more than $1.3 billion. That too, was a strategic partnership.&nbsp;</p><p>These partnerships have been picking up in the face of more antitrust scrutiny. A drop in acquisitions by the Magnificent Seven — Amazon, Microsoft, <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-16"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/">Apple</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span>, Nvidia, Alphabet, <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-17"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/">Meta</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> and <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-18"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/">Tesla</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> — has been offset by an increase in venture-style investing, according to Pitchbook.</p><p>AI and machine-learning investments from those seven tech companies jumped to $24.6 billion last year, up from $4.4 billion in 2022, according to Pitchbook. At the same time, Big Tech's M&amp;A deals fell from 40 deals in 2022 to 13 last year.&nbsp;</p><p>"There is a sort of paranoia motivation to invest in potential disruptors," Pitchbook AI analyst Brendan Burke said in an interview. "The other motivation is to increase sales, and to invest in companies that are likely to use the other company's product — they tend to be partners, more so than competitors."</p><p>Big Tech's spending spree in AI has come under fire for the seemingly circular nature of these agreements. By investing in AI startups, some observers, including Benchmark's Bill Gurley, have accused the tech giants of funneling cash back to their cloud businesses, which in turn, may show up as revenue. Gurley <a href="https://twitter.com/bgurley/status/1748006135913746705" target="_blank">described</a> it as a way to "goose your own revenues."</p><p>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is taking a closer look at these partnerships, including Microsoft's OpenAI deal and Google and Amazon's Anthropic investments. What's sometimes called "round tripping" can be illegal — especially if the aim is to mislead investors. But Amazon has said that this type of venture investing does not constitute round tripping.</p><p>FTC Chair Lina Khan <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/ftc-looking-into-ai-deals-at-amazon-alphabet-microsoft-openai-.html">announced the inquiry</a> during the agency's tech summit on AI, describing it as a "market inquiry into the investments and partnerships being formed between AI developers and major cloud service providers."</p></div><div id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-1"><h2>Don’t miss these stories from CNBC PRO:</h2><div><ul><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/26/jpmorgan-says-all-roads-of-the-ai-boom-lead-to-this-global-chip-manufacturer-thats-trading-at-a-50percent-discount.html"><em>JPMorgan says 'all roads' of the AI boom lead to this global chip manufacturer that's trading at a 50% discount</em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/26/using-options-to-bet-on-a-boeing-turnaround.html"><em>Using options to bet on a Boeing turnaround</em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/26/blackrock-says-bitcoin-returns-likely-to-come-down-now-that-it-has-been-embraced-by-wall-street.html"><em>BlackRock says bitcoin returns likely to come down now that it has been embraced by Wall Street</em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/27/want-to-invest-10000-here-are-5-etfs-to-buy-now-and-hold-according-to-the-pros.html"><em>Want to invest $10,000?

      <p data-substack-content="">In the days <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/03/16/boeing-whistleblower-found-dead-john-barnett-737-max/">before his death</a>, John Barnett was in Charleston, giving a deposition for the whistleblower suit he had filed against Boeing. According to one of his lawyers, Rob Turkewitz, he was upbeat about his testimony, feeling he was finally able to tell the story of his efforts to get the company to take safety more seriously—and the rejection of those efforts by his bosses, who, according to Barnett, simply didn’t want to hear about it.&nbsp;</p><p data-substack-content="">The last day of the deposition was scheduled for Saturday, March 9. But that morning, he was found in his truck, a bullet in his head and a gun in his hand. The police said it was “a self-inflicted wound.”</p><p data-substack-content="">The reaction from people who knew Barnett was utter disbelief. On that last day, his lawyers told <em><a href="https://time.com/6900123/boeing-whistleblower-john-barnett-found-dead-deposition-safety/">Time</a></em><a href="https://time.com/6900123/boeing-whistleblower-john-barnett-found-dead-deposition-safety/"> magazine</a>, “he was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on. We didn’t see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it.” <a href="https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1768741071050457460">A family friend told ABC News</a> that he had told her, “I ain’t scared, but if anything happens to me, it’s not suicide.”&nbsp;</p><p data-substack-content="">The internet lit up. It was an “alleged suicide,” or “an apparent suicide.” “Whatever happened to John Barnett, the Boeing whistle-blower who declared he wasn’t suicidal and then died from ‘an apparent suicide?’ ” <a href="https://twitter.com/RochesterRadar/status/1772271327543525508">read one post on X</a>. The clear implication was that Boeing was somehow involved in his death. (<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/boeing-whistleblower-john-barnett-found-dead-amid-depositions-against-plane-company/ar-BB1jKK6d">In a statement</a>, the company said, “We are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.”)</p><p data-substack-content="">As suspicious as his death was, no one in a position of power is calling for an investigation. And they’re not likely to. But I do know this: everything John Barnett said about Boeing’s problems was true. <em>Everything</em>. If the company had been willing to listen to him, 346 airline passengers would still be alive. And maybe Barnett would be too.</p><div data-substack-content=""><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd558565-f925-4c1e-8ad6-ae59e6ac076c_1336x24.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd558565-f925-4c1e-8ad6-ae59e6ac076c_1336x24.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd558565-f925-4c1e-8ad6-ae59e6ac076c_1336x24.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd558565-f925-4c1e-8ad6-ae59e6ac076c_1336x24.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd558565-f925-4c1e-8ad6-ae59e6ac076c_1336x24.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd558565-f925-4c1e-8ad6-ae59e6ac076c_1336x24.png" width="1336" height="24" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fd558565-f925-4c1e-8ad6-ae59e6ac076c_1336x24.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:24,&quot;width&quot;:1336,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:810,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd558565-f925-4c1e-8ad6-ae59e6ac076c_1336x24.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd558565-f925-4c1e-8ad6-ae59e6ac076c_1336x24.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd558565-f925-4c1e-8ad6-ae59e6ac076c_1336x24.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd558565-f925-4c1e-8ad6-ae59e6ac076c_1336x24.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p data-substack-content="">On Monday, two weeks after Barnett’s death, Boeing announced that three top executives, including the CEO and the chairman of the board, were being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/business/boeing-ceo-steps-down.html">booted out</a> of the company. Finally, it seems, Boeing was waking up to the fact that its internal culture was destroying its reputation. There were the crashes of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-737-max-timeline-history-full-details-2019-9">the two Boeing 737 MAX planes</a> in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people. In January, a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/08/us/alaska-airlines-plug-door-found-investigation-monday/index.html">door panel</a> flew out of an Alaska Airlines plane made by Boeing, while it was in flight, nearly pulling one of the passengers out with it. Was Barnett’s suicide—if that’s what it was—the last straw?&nbsp;</p><p data-substack-content="">Perhaps it was. For seven years, from 2010 to 2017, assigned to the company’s South Carolina assembly plant and appalled by the lax controls, Barnett had tried to persuade his managers that the mistakes they were letting slide could one day be fatal.

(Photo courtesy of <em>Downfall: The Case Against Boeing</em>, via Netflix)</figcaption></figure></div><p data-substack-content="">What is particularly painful about Boeing’s fall from grace is that it was once the gold standard in American manufacturing. Building an airplane requires great engineers, and that’s what Boeing had. It was a company proudly run by engineers, for engineers—for which it made no apologies. There was no need to impress upon employees the importance of safety because it was part of the engineers’ mindset. The company’s stock price? As Jerry Useem <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/how-boeing-lost-its-bearings/602188/">noted</a> a few years ago in <em>The Atlantic</em>, “The company’s chief financial officer had minimal contact with Wall Street and answered colleagues’ requests for basic financial data with a <a href="https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/10/02/288426/">curt</a> ‘Tell them not to worry.’ ”</p><p data-substack-content="">Then came one of the stupidest moves in the history of corporate America. In May 2001, Boeing’s CEO Phil Condit and its president Harry Stonecipher <a href="https://hbr.org/2001/10/inside-boeings-big-move">decided to move</a> the company’s headquarters to Chicago—1,700 miles from its assembly plants in the Seattle area. Condit actually said that the move was made in large part to insulate the top brass from the “day to day business operations.” In other words, Condit and Stonecipher were deliberately divorcing themselves from Boeing’s engineering culture.</p><p data-substack-content="">What they cared about was the stock. Wall Street no longer had the patience to recommend companies with flat or even slowly rising shares. All that mattered were fast-growing companies with fast-growing stock. In addition to pleasing Wall Street, it also made the top executives very rich because, since the 1980s, so much of their compensation was paid in stock options.</p><p data-substack-content="">Then, in 2003, Condit was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-dec-02-fi-boeing2-story.html">forced to resign</a> after Boeing suffered a series of scandals, the last one being his affair with an underling. His successor Stonecipher was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB111019724886272076">ousted</a> two years later when he, too, was caught having an affair—though not before he <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-boeings-shifting-leadership-landscape-and-its-profound-effects/">proudly proclaimed</a> that he was the reason Boeing was “run like a business rather than a great engineering firm.”&nbsp;</p><p data-substack-content="">Stonecipher was replaced by James McNerney, a former executive at General Electric, the company that, under Jack Welch, had led the misguided quest to place shareholder wealth above all other corporate values. At least Condit and Stonecipher, who joined Boeing after a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB850664260619716000">merger with McDonnell Douglas</a>, had aviation backgrounds; McNerney had none. By then, as airline expert Mike Boyd told me, “Instead of building airplanes, all they cared about was building the bottom line.”</p><p data-substack-content="">In 2014, McNerney’s last full year with the company, he pulled down a cool <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-ceo-took-home-almost-29m-last-year/">$29 million</a> in compensation. Originally, Boeing was going to build a new airplane from scratch. But seeing that its chief competitor, Airbus, was getting record orders for its new plane, McNerney decided to build the 737 MAX on top of the existing 737 frame—but market it as a new airplane. Boeing was in a huge rush to catch up to Airbus; indeed, by the time it started delivering the plane it had thousands of orders.&nbsp;</p><p data-substack-content="">“They threw the MAX together at the last minute,” said Boyd. But hey, it would save money—which would increase profits and boost the stock price. The combination of that decision, along with shortcuts Boeing now regularly made that compromised safety, was a terrible mistake.&nbsp;</p><p data-substack-content="">Then came the two 737 MAX crashes. The first, <a href="https://archive.ph/DcQRJ">Lion Air 610</a>, crashed within minutes of its departure from Jakarta, Indonesia, killing 189 people. The second, five months later, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/17/ethiopia-plane-crash-boeing-1224259">Ethiopian Airlines 302</a>, again crashed minutes after takeoff. All 157 people on board died.&nbsp;</p><div data-substack-content=""><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa70786ae-0060-4422-9b84-ea963d088805_1024x683.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa70786ae-0060-4422-9b84-ea963d088805_1024x683.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa70786ae-0060-4422-9b84-ea963d088805_1024x683.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa70786ae-0060-4422-9b84-ea963d088805_1024x683.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa70786ae-0060-4422-9b84-ea963d088805_1024x683.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa70786ae-0060-4422-9b84-ea963d088805_1024x683.jpeg" width="1024" height="683" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a70786ae-0060-4422-9b84-ea963d088805_1024x683.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:683,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:211770,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Crashing planes.

(Photo by Jemal Countess via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div><p data-substack-content="">After each crash, Boeing apologized profusely, but also insisted that, as then-CEO Dennis Muilenburg told Congress, “Safety is in our DNA.” But everyone could see that it wasn’t. In an effort to get the plane out quickly, Boeing, with the assent of the FAA, had even <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/internal-boeing-737-max-documents-show-pilots-trying-to-hide-simulator-problems-from-faa/">told the airlines</a> that their pilots didn’t need to conduct flight simulator tests. That was a critical mistake, because the pilots would have discovered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18275736/boeing-737-max-plane-crashes-grounded-problems-info-details-explained-reasons#B10ojB">the issue</a> that <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/ASR1901.pdf">caused the planes to crash</a>. The company was excoriated by Democrats and Republicans alike, furious that Boeing had so blatantly put profits over safety.</p><p data-substack-content="">Internal Boeing documents made public by Congress showed that the company’s engineers were disgusted by what they were being asked to do in building the 737 MAX. “This airplane is designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2020-01-10/-designed-by-clowns-and-supervised-by-monkeys-the-737-max-story">read one internal email</a> between engineers. A second one read: “I’ll be shocked if the FAA passes this turd.” And a third: “Would you put your family on a MAX simulator trained aircraft? I wouldn’t.” There were also comments about how all the company cared about was cutting costs.</p><p data-substack-content="">That is what John Barnett was so urgently trying to impress upon his bosses when he was a quality control manager at Boeing: the company was making unsafe planes, and someday people were going to die as a result. And it’s what he tried to tell the rest of us once he became a whistleblower. In addition to all the interviews he gave after the various Boeing mishaps—let’s not forget <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/travel/article/sfo-united-flight-lost-tire-parking-lot-18712182.php">the wheel that fell off</a> a 777 during a takeoff at San Francisco’s airport earlier this month—his lawsuit was going to expose some critical safety errors at the company the world didn’t yet know about.</p><p data-substack-content="">Boyd, who is highly critical of the modern Boeing culture, told me that the company has completely lost its way. And the safety issues are only part of the problem. For years, Boeing’s chief competitor, the European company Airbus, lagged behind the American behemoth. Not anymore. “Airbus is ten years ahead of them,” Boyd said. Boeing, he said, has “nothing on the drawing boards. Firing a few executives isn’t going to change Boeing. What they need to do is take a bulldozer to the entire board of directors.”</p><p data-substack-content="">It is difficult to imagine America without Boeing, the company that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180928-boeing-747-50-years-of-the-jumbo-jet">pioneered</a> the famously gargantuan 747, which began flying in 1969 and is still considered one of the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/02/23/how-the-first-747-took-off-and-changed-aviation-forever/">greatest airplanes</a> ever made. John Barnett is dead. But his mission should be kept alive. If Boeing is to have any chance of becoming great again, it needs to listen to what he had to say.</p><div data-substack-content=""><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8696396-4bdf-4957-87e0-6c96a89da70e_1336x24.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8696396-4bdf-4957-87e0-6c96a89da70e_1336x24.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8696396-4bdf-4957-87e0-6c96a89da70e_1336x24.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8696396-4bdf-4957-87e0-6c96a89da70e_1336x24.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8696396-4bdf-4957-87e0-6c96a89da70e_1336x24.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8696396-4bdf-4957-87e0-6c96a89da70e_1336x24.png" width="1336" height="24" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e8696396-4bdf-4957-87e0-6c96a89da70e_1336x24.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:24,&quot;width&quot;:1336,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:810,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8696396-4bdf-4957-87e0-6c96a89da70e_1336x24.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8696396-4bdf-4957-87e0-6c96a89da70e_1336x24.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8696396-4bdf-4957-87e0-6c96a89da70e_1336x24.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8696396-4bdf-4957-87e0-6c96a89da70e_1336x24.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p data-substack-content=""><em><strong>Joe Nocera is a columnist for The Free Press and the co-author of <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-big-fail-what-the-pandemic-revealed-about-who-america-protects-and-who-it-leaves-behind-joe-nocera/19667924?ean=9780593331026">The Big Fail</a>.

<p>Andy Bechtolsheim, who was at the time chair of Arista Networks, a datacenter networking firm he co-founded, was aware of the deal because he had been consulted on it by "another multinational technology company" that had also been considering acquiring Acacia, the SEC says.</p>

    

<p>According to the SEC's <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2024/comp-pr2024-40.pdf">complaint</a>, the manager at the unnamed company that was considering acquiring Acacia texted Bechtolsheim that he "needed to chat rather urgently regarding a possible transaction in the optics space."</p>

        


        

<p>The SEC alleges Bechtolsheim "immediately" acquired Acacia option contracts when learning of the pending purchase by Cisco, which earned him $415,726 in profit when markets opened and Acacia shares rose 35 percent on news of the purchase.</p>

</ul>
<p>The complaint alleges that Bechtolsheim "knew or was reckless in not knowing" that the information he was given was non-public, and that he had a duty to keep that information confidential.</p>
<p>"We allege that Bechtolsheim, while serving as the chairman of a publicly traded company, abused the trust of a longtime business contact who had shared highly sensitive information about an imminent corporate acquisition," said SEC market abuse unit chief Joseph G Sansone.</p>
<p>Bechtolsheim has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $923,740 for earning slightly more than half that for his illegal trades, and has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.</p>

        

<p>Forbes <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/andreas-von-bechtolsheim/" rel="nofollow">lists</a> Bechtolsheim's net worth at somewhere north of $16 billion. The SEC fine is less than 0.006 percent of his holdings. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" role="main">
      

<p><a href="https://aider.chat/assets/2024-03-07-claude-3.svg"><img src="https://aider.chat/assets/2024-03-07-claude-3.svg" alt="benchmark results"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family">Anthropic just released their new Claude 3 models</a>
with evals showing better performance on coding tasks.
With that in mind, I’ve been benchmarking the new models
using Aider’s code editing benchmark suite.</p>

<p>Claude 3 Opus outperforms all of OpenAI’s models,
making it the best available model for pair programming with AI.</p>

<p>Aider currently supports Claude 3 Opus via
<a href="https://aider.chat/docs/faq.html#accessing-other-llms-with-openrouter">OpenRouter</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code># Install aider
pip install aider-chat

# Setup OpenRouter access
export OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your-openrouter-key&gt;
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1

# Run aider with Claude 3 Opus using the diff editing format
aider --model anthropic/claude-3-opus --edit-format diff
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="aiders-code-editing-benchmark">Aider’s code editing benchmark</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider">Aider</a>
is an open source command line chat tool that lets you
pair program with AI on code in your local git repo.</p>

<p>Aider relies on a
<a href="https://aider.chat/docs/benchmarks.html">code editing benchmark</a>
to quantitatively evaluate how well
an LLM can make changes to existing code.
The benchmark uses aider to try and complete
<a href="https://github.com/exercism/python">133 Exercism Python coding exercises</a>.
For each exercise,
Exercism provides a starting python file with stubs for the needed functions,
a natural language description of the problem to solve
and a test suite to evaluate whether the coder has correctly solved the problem.</p>

<p>The LLM gets two tries to solve each problem:</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the first try, it gets the initial stub code and the English description of the coding task. If the tests all pass, we are done.</li>
  <li>If any tests failed, aider sends the LLM the failing test output and gives it a second try to complete the task.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="benchmark-results">Benchmark results</h2>

<h3 id="claude-3-opus">Claude 3 Opus</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The new <code>claude-3-opus-20240229</code> model got the highest score ever on this benchmark, completing 68.4% of the tasks with two tries.</li>
  <li>Its single-try performance was comparable to the latest GPT-4 Turbo model <code>gpt-4-0125-preview</code>, at 54.1%.</li>
  <li>While Opus got the highest score, it was only a few points higher than the GPT-4 Turbo results. Given the extra costs of Opus and the slower response times, it remains to be seen which is the most practical model for daily coding use.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="claude-3-sonnet">Claude 3 Sonnet</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The new <code>claude-3-sonnet-20240229</code> model performed similarly to OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo models with an overall score of 54.9% and a first-try score of 43.6%.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="code-editing">Code editing</h2>

<p>It’s highly desirable to have the LLM send back code edits as
some form of diffs, rather than having it send back an updated copy of the
entire source code.</p>

<p>Weaker models like GPT-3.5 are unable to use diffs, and are stuck sending back
updated copies of entire source files.
Aider uses more efficient
<a href="https://aider.chat/2023/07/02/benchmarks.html#diff">search/replace blocks</a>
with the original GPT-4
and
<a href="https://aider.chat/2023/12/21/unified-diffs.html#unified-diff-editing-format">unified diffs</a>
with the newer GPT-4 Turbo models.</p>

<p>Claude 3 Opus works best with the search/replace blocks, allowing it to send back
code changes efficiently.
Unfortunately, the Sonnet model was only able to work reliably with whole files,
which limits it to editing smaller source files and uses more tokens, money and time.</p>

<h2 id="other-observations">Other observations</h2>

<p>There are a few other things worth noting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Claude 3 Opus and Sonnet are both slower and more expensive than OpenAI’s models. You can get almost the same coding skill faster and cheaper with OpenAI’s models.</li>
  <li>Claude 3 has a 2X larger context window than the latest GPT-4 Turbo, which may be an advantage when working with larger code bases.</li>
  <li>The Claude models refused to perform a number of coding tasks and returned the error “Output blocked by content filtering policy”. They refused to code up the <a href="https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/beer-song">beer song</a> program, which makes some sort of superficial sense. But they also refused to work in some larger open source code bases, for unclear reasons.</li>
  <li>The Claude APIs seem somewhat unstable, returning HTTP 5xx errors of various sorts. Aider automatically recovers from these errors with exponential backoff retries, but it’s a sign that Anthropic made be struggling under surging demand.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm">https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39838104">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Today, we are excited to introduce DBRX, an open, general-purpose LLM created by Databricks. Across a range of standard benchmarks, DBRX sets a new state-of-the-art for established open LLMs. Moreover, it provides the open community and enterprises building their own LLMs with capabilities that were previously limited to closed model APIs; according to our measurements, it surpasses GPT-3.5, and it is competitive with Gemini 1.0 Pro. It is an especially capable code model, surpassing specialized models like CodeLLaMA-70B on programming, in addition to its strength as a general-purpose LLM.</span></p><p><span>This state-of-the-art quality comes with marked improvements in training and inference performance. DBRX advances the state-of-the-art in efficiency among open models thanks to its fine-grained mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. Inference is up to 2x faster than LLaMA2-70B, and DBRX is about 40% of the size of Grok-1 in terms of both total and active parameter-counts. When hosted on Mosaic AI Model Serving, DBRX can generate text at up to 150 tok/s/user. Our customers will find that training MoEs is also about 2x more FLOP-efficient than training dense models for the same final model quality. End-to-end, our overall recipe for DBRX (including the pretraining data, model architecture, and optimization strategy) can match the quality of our previous-generation MPT models with nearly 4x less compute.</span></p><figure role="group"><img alt="general knowledge infographic" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7d16fa39-9240-4c3f-b5ae-3c3ba598e4f2" src="https://www.databricks.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/general-knowledge-infographic-01.png" width="2400" height="1425" loading="lazy" data-ot-ignore="1"><figcaption>Figure 1: DBRX outperforms established open source models on language understanding (MMLU), Programming (HumanEval), and Math (GSM8K).</figcaption></figure><p><span>The weights of the base model (<a data-external-link="true" href="https://huggingface.co/databricks/dbrx-base" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DBRX Base</a>) and the finetuned model (<a data-external-link="true" href="https://huggingface.co/databricks/dbrx-instruct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DBRX Instruct</a>) are available on Hugging Face under an open license. Starting today, DBRX is available for Databricks customers to use via APIs, and Databricks customers can pretrain their own DBRX-class models from scratch or continue training on top of one of our checkpoints using the same tools and science we used to build it. DBRX is already being integrated into our GenAI-powered products, where - in applications like SQL - early rollouts have surpassed GPT-3.5 Turbo and are challenging GPT-4 Turbo. It is also a leading model among open models and GPT-3.5 Turbo on RAG tasks.</span></p><p><span>Training mixture-of-experts models is hard. We had to overcome a variety of scientific and performance challenges to build a pipeline robust enough to repeatably train DBRX-class models in an efficient manner. Now that we have done so, we have a one-of-a-kind training stack that allows any enterprise to train world-class MoE foundation models from scratch. We look forward to sharing that capability with our customers and sharing our lessons learned with the community.</span></p><p><span>Download DBRX today from Hugging Face (<a data-external-link="true" href="https://huggingface.co/databricks/dbrx-base" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DBRX Base</a>, <a data-external-link="true" href="https://huggingface.co/databricks/dbrx-instruct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DBRX Instruct</a>), or try out DBRX Instruct in our <a data-external-link="true" href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/databricks/dbrx-instruct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HF Space</a>, &nbsp;or see our model repository on github: <a data-external-link="true" href="https://www.github.com/databricks/dbrx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">databricks/dbrx</a>.</span></p><h2>What is DBRX?</h2><p><span>DBRX is a <a data-external-link="true" href="https://www.isattentionallyouneed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transformer-based</a> decoder-only large language model (LLM) that was trained using next-token prediction. It uses a fine-grained mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with 132B total parameters of which 36B parameters are active on any input. It was pre-trained on 12T tokens of text and code data. Compared to other open MoE models like Mixtral and Grok-1, DBRX is fine-grained, meaning it uses a larger number of smaller experts. DBRX has 16 experts and chooses 4, while Mixtral and Grok-1 have 8 experts and choose 2. This provides 65x more possible combinations of experts and we found that this improves model quality. DBRX uses rotary position encodings (RoPE), gated linear units (GLU), and grouped query attention (GQA). It uses the GPT-4 tokenizer as provided in the <a data-external-link="true" href="https://github.com/openai/tiktoken" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tiktoken</a> repository. We made these choices based on exhaustive evaluation and scaling experiments.</span></p><p><span>DBRX was pretrained on 12T tokens of carefully curated data and a maximum context length of 32k tokens. We estimate that this data is at least 2x better token-for-token than the data we used to pretrain the MPT family of models. This new dataset was developed using the full suite of Databricks tools, including Apache Spark™ and Databricks notebooks for data processing, <a data-external-link="true" href="https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog">Unity Catalog</a> for data management and governance, and MLflow for experiment tracking. We used curriculum learning for pretraining, changing the data mix during training in ways we found to substantially improve model quality.</span></p><h2>Quality on Benchmarks vs. Leading Open Models</h2><p><span>Table 1 shows the quality of DBRX Instruct and leading established, open models. DBRX Instruct is the leading model on composite benchmarks, programming and mathematics benchmarks, and MMLU. It surpasses all chat or instruction finetuned models on standard benchmarks.</span></p><p><span><strong>Composite benchmarks.</strong> We evaluated DBRX Instruct and peers on two composite benchmarks: the <a data-external-link="true" href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard</a> (the average of ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, WinoGrande, and GSM8k) and the <a data-external-link="true" href="https://github.com/mosaicml/llm-foundry/blob/main/scripts/eval/local_data/EVAL_GAUNTLET.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Databricks Model Gauntlet</a> (a suite of over 30 tasks spanning six categories: world knowledge, commonsense reasoning, language understanding, reading comprehension, symbolic problem solving, and programming).</span></p><p><span>Among the models we evaluated, DBRX Instruct scores the highest on two composite benchmarks: the Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard (74.5% vs. 72.7% for the next highest model, Mixtral Instruct) and the Databricks Gauntlet (66.8% vs. 60.7% for the next highest model, Mixtral Instruct).</span></p><p><span><strong>Programming and mathematics.</strong> DBRX Instruct is especially strong at programming and mathematics. It scores higher than the other open models we evaluated on HumanEval (70.1% vs. 63.2% for Grok-1, 54.8% for Mixtral Instruct, and 32.2% for the best-performing LLaMA2-70B variant) and GSM8k (66.9% vs. 62.9% for Grok-1, 61.1% for Mixtral Instruct, and 54.1% for the best-performing LLaMA2-70B variant). DBRX outperforms Grok-1, the next best model on these benchmarks, despite the fact that Grok-1 has 2.4x as many parameters. On HumanEval, DBRX Instruct even surpasses CodeLLaMA-70B Instruct, a model built explicitly for programming, despite the fact that DBRX Instruct is designed for general-purpose use (70.1% vs. 67.8% on HumanEval as reported by Meta in the <a data-external-link="true" href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/code-llama-large-language-model-coding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodeLLaMA

This is especially so at Databricks, where we build models like DBRX to establish a process for our customers to train their own foundation models.</span></p><p><span>We found training mixture-of-experts models to provide substantial improvements in compute-efficiency for training (Table 5). For example, training a smaller member of the DBRX family called DBRX MoE-B (23.5B total parameters, 6.6B active parameters) required 1.7x fewer FLOPs to reach a score of 45.5% on the Databricks LLM Gauntlet than LLaMA2-13B required to reach 43.8%. DBRX MoE-B also contains half as many active parameters as LLaMA2-13B.</span></p><p><span>Looking holistically, our end-to-end LLM pretraining pipeline has become nearly 4x more compute-efficient in the past ten months. On May 5, 2023, we released <a data-external-link="true" href="https://www.databricks.com/blog/mpt-7b">MPT-7B</a>, a 7B parameter model trained on 1T tokens that reached a Databricks LLM Gauntlet score of 30.9%. A member of the DBRX family called DBRX MoE-A (7.7B total parameters, 2.2B active parameters) reached a Databricks Gauntlet score of 30.5% with 3.7x fewer FLOPs. This efficiency is the result of a number of improvements, including using an MoE architecture, other architecture changes to the network, better optimization strategies, better tokenization, and - very importantly - better pretraining data.</span></p><p><span>In isolation, better pretraining data made a substantial impact on model quality. We trained a 7B model on 1T tokens (called DBRX Dense-A) using the DBRX pretraining data. It reached 39.0% on the Databricks Gauntlet compared to 30.9% for MPT-7B. We estimate that our new pretraining data is at least 2x better token-for-token than the data used to train MPT-7B. In other words, we estimate that half as many tokens are necessary to reach the same model quality. We determined this by training DBRX Dense-A on 500B tokens; it outperformed MPT-7B on the Databricks Gauntlet, reaching 32.1%. In addition to better data quality, another important contributor to this token-efficiency may be the GPT-4 tokenizer, which has a large vocabulary and is believed to be especially token-efficient. These lessons about improving data quality translate directly into practices and tools that our customers use to train foundation models on their own data.</span></p><div><table><colgroup><col width="164"><col width="103"><col width="100"><col width="122"><col width="118"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Model</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Total Params</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Active Params</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Gauntlet Score</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Relative FLOPs</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>DBRX MoE-A</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>7.7B</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>2.2B</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>30.5%</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>1x</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>MPT-7B (1T tokens)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>—</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>6.7B</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>30.9%</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>3.7x</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>DBRX Dense-A (1T tokens)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>—</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>6.7B</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>39.0%</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>3.7x</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>DBRX Dense-A (500B tokens)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>—</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>6.7B</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>32.1%</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>1.85x</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>DBRX MoE-B</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>23.5B</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>6.6B</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>45.5%</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>1x</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>LLaMA2-13B</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>—</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>13.0B</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>43.8%</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td><td><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>1.7x</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Table 5. Details of several test articles that we used to validate the training efficiency of the DBRX MoE architecture and end-to-end training pipeline</p><h2>Inference Efficiency</h2><p><span>Figure 2 shows the end-to-end inference efficiency of serving DBRX and similar models using NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM with our optimized serving infrastructure and 16-bit precision. We aim for this benchmark to reflect real-world usage as closely as possible, including multiple users simultaneously hitting the same inference server. We spawn one new user per second, each user request contains an approximately 2000 token prompt, and each response comprises 256 tokens.</span></p><p><span>In general, MoE models are faster at inference than their total parameter-counts would suggest. This is due to the fact that they use relatively few parameters for each input. We find that DBRX is no exception in this respect. DBRX inference throughput is 2-3x higher than a 132B non-MoE model.</span></p><p><span>Inference efficiency and model quality are typically in tension: bigger models typically reach higher quality, but smaller models are more efficient for inference. Using an MoE architecture makes it possible to attain better tradeoffs between model quality and inference efficiency than dense models typically achieve. For example, DBRX is both higher quality than LLaMA2-70B and - thanks to having about half as many active parameters - DBRX inference throughput is up to 2x faster (Figure 2). Mixtral is another point on the improved pareto frontier attained by MoE models: it is smaller than DBRX, and it is correspondingly lower in terms of quality but reaches higher inference throughput.

The main process of building DBRX - including pretraining, post-training, evaluation, red-teaming, and refining - took place over the course of three months. It was the continuation of months of science, dataset research, and scaling experiments, not to mention years of LLM development at Databricks that includes the <a data-external-link="true" href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/mpt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MPT</a> and <a data-external-link="true" href="https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/12/dolly-first-open-commercially-viable-instruction-tuned-llm">Dolly</a> projects and the thousands of models we have built and brought to production with our customers.</span></p><p><span>To build DBRX, we leveraged the same suite of Databricks tools that are available to our customers. We managed and governed our training data using Unity Catalog. We explored this data using newly acquired <a data-external-link="true" href="https://www.lilacml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lilac AI</a>. We processed and cleaned this data using Apache Spark™ and Databricks notebooks. We trained DBRX using optimized versions of our open-source training libraries: <a data-external-link="true" href="https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/megablocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MegaBlocks</a>, <a data-external-link="true" href="https://github.com/mosaicml/llm-foundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LLM Foundry</a>, <a data-external-link="true" href="https://github.com/mosaicml/composer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Composer</a>, and <a data-external-link="true" href="https://github.com/mosaicml/streaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streaming</a>. We managed large scale model training and finetuning across thousands of GPUs using our Mosaic AI Training service. We logged our results using <a data-external-link="true" href="https://mlflow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MLflow</a>. We collected human feedback for quality and safety improvements through Mosaic AI Model Serving and Inference Tables. We manually experimented with the model using the Databricks Playground. We found the Databricks tools to be best-in-class for each of their purposes, and we benefited from the fact that they were all part of a unified product experience.</span></p><h2>Get Started with DBRX on Databricks</h2><p><span>If you’re looking to start working with DBRX right away, it’s easy to do so with the Databricks Mosaic AI <a data-external-link="true" href="https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/foundation-models/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foundation Model APIs</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Two nights of broken sleep are enough to make people feel years older, according to researchers, who said consistent, restful slumber was a key factor in helping to stave off feeling one’s true age.</p><p>Psychologists in Sweden found that, on average, volunteers felt more than four years older when they were restricted to only four hours of sleep for two consecutive nights, with some claiming the sleepiness made them feel decades older.</p><p>The opposite was seen when people were allowed to stay in bed for nine hours, though the effect was more modest, with participants in the study claiming to feel on average three months younger than their real age after ample rest.</p><p>“Sleep has a major impact on how old you feel and it’s not only your long-term sleep patterns,” said Dr Leonie Balter, a psychoneuroimmunologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and first author on the study. “Even when you only sleep less for two nights that has a real impact on how you feel.”</p><figure id="308bf606-2383-49c6-bafe-e9ed6370da94" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:4,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Is going to bed at 9pm the secret to happiness?

In the first, 429 people aged 18 to 70 answered questions about how old they felt and on how many nights, if any, they had slept badly in the past month. Their sleepiness was also rated according to a standard scale used in psychology research.</p><p>For each day of poor sleep the volunteers felt on average three months older, the scientists found, while those who reported no bad nights in the preceding month felt on average nearly six years younger than their true age. It was unclear, however, whether bad sleep made people feel older or vice versa.</p><p>In the second study, the researchers quizzed 186 volunteers aged 18 to 46 on how old they felt after two nights of plentiful sleep, in which they stayed in bed for nine hours each night, and two nights when they slept for only four hours a night. After two nights of restricted sleep, the participants felt on average 4.44 years older than when they had ample sleep. Feeling older was linked, unsurprisingly, to feeling sleepier.</p><p>“If you want to feel young, the most important thing is to protect your sleep,” Balter said.</p><p>Writing in <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2024.0171" data-link-name="in body link">Proceedings of the Royal Society B</a>, the psychologists describe differences in people’s responses to sleep loss depending on whether they were a morning person, who woke and went to bed early, or an evening person who rose late and retired late. Evening types typically felt older than their true age even after plenty of sleep, but morning types were hit harder in how old they felt when their sleep was disrupted.</p><p>Balter says the findings, if confirmed, could be put to good use. “It’s important to realise how malleable subjective age is,” she said. “If we can make people feel younger, they may be able to have the associated benefits, such as being more willing to take on new experiences and being socially active and physically active.”</p><p>Dr Serena Sabatini, a psychologist at the University of Surrey, who was not involved in the study, called the results “promising”, but said investigating whether they held up in older people should be a priority for future research.</p><p>“Another important thing to consider in future research is an exploration of these mechanisms over time,” she added. “This study tells us that a bad night of sleep can impact how we feel the day after, but what are the cumulative effects of bad sleep for months and years?”</p><p>Dr Iuliana Hartescu, a senior lecturer in psychology at Loughborough University, who was also not involved in the study, said insufficient or poor sleep quality was important for lifestyle behaviours that ultimately affect long-term health.</p><p>“Sleep is one modifiable behaviour which has an immediate, noticeable effect on health,” she said. “The effects of poor diet and low physical activity take some time to notice. The effect of a poor night of sleep is immediate and influences all the other 24-hour lifestyle behaviours.”</p><p>In separate work, a 10-year study of more than 4,000 Europeans found those who consistently exercised two to three times a week were significantly less likely to suffer from insomnia than inactive people, and better able to clock up the recommended six to nine hours of sleep each night.</p><p>The international team of researchers analysed questionnaires from people enrolled in the European community respiratory health survey on their exercise habits, how well and how long they slept, and how sleepy they felt in the day. Volunteers at 21 sites in nine countries were followed for a decade.</p><p>Those who exercised two or more times a week, for at least an hour a week, were 42% less likely to have problems falling asleep than inactive people, the study found, and 55% more likely to be “normal sleepers” who got a healthy amount of shut-eye each night.</p><p>“This study has a long follow-up period, 10 years, and indicates strongly that consistency in physical activity might be an important factor in optimising sleep duration and reducing the symptoms of insomnia,” the authors <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-067197" data-link-name="in body link">write in BMJ Open</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>egui changelog</h2>
<p>The hit test logic (what is the user clicking on?) has been completely rewritten, and should now be much more accurate and helpful.<br>
The hit test and interaction logic is run at the start of the frame, using the widgets rects from the previous frame, but the latest mouse coordinates.<br>
It enabled getting a <code>Response</code> for a widget <em>before</em> creating it using <code>Context::read_response</code>.<br>
This will in the future unlock more powerful widget styling options.<br>
The new hit test also allows clicking slightly outside a button and still hit it, improving the support for touch screens.</p>
<p>The menus have also been improved so that they both act and feel better, with no change in API.<br>
Included in this is much nicer looking shadows, supporting an offset.</p>

chroot (1)           - run command or interactive shell with special root directory
chroot (2)           - change root directory
</code></pre><p>Chroot is a kernel mechanism available since early versions of UNIX that allows to run a process as with an alternate root directory. The process shares the kernel and hardware, but only has access to a subtree of the file system.</p>

<p>FreeBSD jails basically take chroot and build upon it by adding mechanism to isolate and control the use of other system resources beside the filesystem.</p>
<p>The end result is a kernel mechanism that is a complete container implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully (More or less, depending onthe exact configuration of the jail) isolated userspace</li>
<li>Running on the same kernel as the host</li>
</ul>

<p>Control groups are a mechanism in Linux that allows to control which how much of the system resources a process (and it’s child processes) can use. It wasn’t originally meant for virtualisation, but rather as a system to avoid processes fighting over hardware, and to implement quotas. It however turned out to be very useful when it came to implement containers.</p>
<h2 id="namespaces-linux-starting-2002">Namespaces <em>(Linux, starting 2002)</em></h2>
<p>Namespaces allow to isolate processes within the namespace from the rest with regard to a specific global resource such as mount points, process ids, user ids, interprocess communication, networking or time.</p>
<p>But more crucially they also allow to isolate across cgroups, giving the illusion of being alone on the system.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-make-a-linux-container">How to make a linux container</h2>
<p>With those mechanisms (chroot, cgroups and namespaces) in place creating a container is conceptually relatively simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>First you populate the subtree that your container will have access too, ready to be chroot’ed in</li>
<li>Then you create namespaces for all you need to isolate (this usually includes at least PID, UID, mountpoints and cgroups)</li>
<li>Finally you run your containerized process within your namespaces, chroot’ed to its subtree</li>
</ul>

   <p><img src="https://www.annwan.me/computers/what-why-how-containers/images/comic_end.png"></p><p>In practice you don’t need to make them from scratch, people already have made systems for managing containers with nicer user interfaces. Those include Docker, LXC and systemd-nspawn just to name a few, and there is probably one just right for your use-case.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theerlangelist.com/article/why_elixir">https://www.theerlangelist.com/article/why_elixir</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39836852">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>
It’s been about a year since I’ve started using Elixir. Originally, I intended to use the language only for blogging purposes, thinking it could help me better illustrate benefits of Erlang Virtual Machine (EVM). However, I was immediately fascinated with what the language brings to the table, and very quickly introduced it to the Erlang based production system I have been developing at the time. Today, I consider Elixir as a better alternative for the development of EVM powered systems, and in this posts I’ll try to highlight some of its benefits, and also dispell some misconceptions about it.</p>
<h2>
The problems of Erlang the language</h2>
<p>
EVM has many benefits that makes it easier to build highly-available, scalable, fault-tolerant, distributed systems. There are various testimonials on the Internet, and I’ve blogged a bit about some advantages of Erlang <a href="http://theerlangelist.com/2012/12/yet-another-introduction-to-erlang.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.theerlangelist.com/2013/01/erlang-based-server-systems.html">here</a>, and the chapter 1 of my upcoming book <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action-second-edition?a_aid=sjuric">Elixir in Action</a> presents benefits of both Erlang and Elixir.</p>
<p>
Long story short, Erlang provides excellent abstractions for managing highly-scalable, fault-tolerant systems, which is particularly useful in concurrent systems, where many independent or loosely-dependent tasks must be performed. I’ve been using Erlang in production for more than three years, to build a long-polling based HTTP push server that in peak time serves over 2000 reqs/sec (non-cached). Never before have I written anything of this scale nor have I ever developed something this stable. The service just runs happily, without me thinking about it. This was actually my first Erlang code, bloated with anti-patterns, and bad approaches. And still, EVM proved to be very resilient, and run the code as best as it could. Most importantly, it was fairly straightforward for me to work on the complex problem, mostly owing to Erlang concurrency mechanism.</p>
<p>
However, despite some great properties, I never was (and I’m still not) quite comfortable programming in Erlang. The coding experience somehow never felt very fluent, and the resulting code was always burdened with excessive boilerplate and duplication. <strong>The problem was not the language syntax</strong>. I did a little Prolog back in my student days, and I liked the language a lot. By extension, I also like Erlang syntax, and actually think it is in many ways nicer and more elegant than Elixir. And this is coming from an OO developer who spent most of his coding time in languages such as Ruby, JavaScript, C# and C++.</p>
<p>
The problem I have with Erlang is that the language is somehow too simple, making it very hard to eliminate boilerplate and structural duplication. Conversely, the resulting code gets a bit messy, being harder to write, analyze, and modify. After coding in Erlang for some time, I thought that functional programming is inferior to OO, when it comes to efficient code organization.</p>
<h2>
What Elixir is (not)</h2>
<p>
This is where Elixir changed my opinion. After I’ve spent enough time with the language, I was finally able to see benefits and elegance of functional programming more clearly. Now I can’t say anymore that I prefer OO to FP. I find the coding experience in Elixir much more pleasant, and I’m able to concentrate on the problem I’m solving, instead of dealing with the language’s shortcomings.</p>
<p>
Before discussing some benefits of Elixir, there is an important thing I’d like to stress: <strong>Elixir is not Ruby for Erlang</strong>. It is also not CoffeeScript, Clojure, C++ or something else for Erlang. Relationship between Elixir and Erlang is unique, with Elixir being often semantically very close to Erlang, but in addition bringing many ideas from different languages. The end result may on surface look like Ruby, but I find it much more closer to Erlang, with both languages completely sharing the type system, and taking the same functional route.</p>
<p>
So what is Elixir? To me, it is an Erlang-like language with improved code organization capabilities. This definition differs from what you’ll see on the official page, but I think it captures the essence of Elixir, when compared to Erlang.</p>
<p>
Let me elaborate on this. In my opinion, a programming language has a couple of roles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
It serves as an interface that allows programmers to control something, e.g. a piece of hardware, a virtual machine, a running application, UI layout, …  </li>
  <li>
It shapes the way developers think about the world they’re modeling. An OO language will make us look for entities with state and behavior, while in FP language we’ll think about data and transformations. A declarative programming language will force us to think about rules, while in imperative language we’ll think more about sequence of actions.  </li>
  <li>
It provides tools to organize the code, remove duplications, boilerplate, noise, and hopefully model the problem as closely as possible to the way we understand it.  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Erlang and Elixir are completely identical in first two roles - they target the same “thing” (EVM), and they both take a functional approach. It is in role three where Elixir improves on Erlang, and gives us additional tools to organize our code, and hopefully be more efficient in writing production-ready, maintainable code.</p>
<h2>
Ingredients</h2>
<p>
Much has been said about Elixir on the Internet, but I especially like two articles from Devin Torres which you can find <a href="https://devinus.io/the-excitement-of-elixir/">here</a> and <a href="https://devinus.io/elixir-its-not-about-syntax/">here</a>. Devin is an experienced Erlang developer, who among other things wrote a popular <a href="https://github.com/devinus/poolboy">poolboy</a> library, so it’s worth reading what he thinks about Elixir.</p>
<p>
I’ll try not to repeat much, and avoid going into many mechanical details. Instead, let’s do a brief tour of main tools that can be used for better code organization.</p>
<h3>
Metaprogramming</h3>
<p>
Metaprogramming in Elixir comes in a couple of flavors, but the essence is the same. It allows us to write concise constructs that seems as if they’re a part of the language. These constructs are in compile-time then transformed into a proper code. On a mechanical level, it helps us remove structural duplication - a case where two pieces of code share the same abstract pattern, but they differ in many mechanical details.</p>
<p>
For example, a following snippet presents a sketch of a module models a <code>User</code> record:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>User</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3341369101-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>#initializer</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span data-group-id="3341369101-2">(</span><span>data</span><span data-group-id="3341369101-2">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3341369101-3">do</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3341369101-3">end</span><span>

  </span><span># getters</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span data-group-id="3341369101-4">(</span><span>user</span><span data-group-id="3341369101-4">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3341369101-5">do</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3341369101-5">end</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>age</span><span data-group-id="3341369101-6">(</span><span>user</span><span data-group-id="3341369101-6">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3341369101-7">do</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3341369101-7">end</span><span>

  </span><span># setters</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span data-group-id="3341369101-8">(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>user</span><span data-group-id="3341369101-8">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3341369101-9">do</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3341369101-9">end</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>age</span><span data-group-id="3341369101-10">(</span><span>value</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>user</span><span data-group-id="3341369101-10">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3341369101-11">do</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3341369101-11">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="3341369101-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Some other type of record will follow this pattern, but contain different fields. Instead of copy-pasting this pattern, we can use Elixir <code>defrecord</code> macro:</p>
<pre><code><span>defrecord</span><span> </span><span>User</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>age</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span></code></pre>
<p>
Based on the given definition, <code>defrecord</code> generates a dedicated module that contains utility functions for manipulating our <code>User</code> record. Thus, the common pattern is stated only in one place (the code of <code>defrecord</code> macro), while the particular logic is relieved of mechanical implementation details.</p>
<p>
Elixir macros are nothing like C/C++ macros. Instead of working on strings, they are something like compile-time Elixir functions that are called in the middle of parsing, and work on the abstract syntax tree (AST), which is a code represented as Elixir data structure. Macro can work on AST, and spit out some alternative AST that represents the generated code. Consequently, macros are executed in compile-time, so once we come to runtime, the performance is not affected, and there are no surprise situations where some piece of code can change the definition of a module (which is possible for example in JavaScript or Ruby).</p>
<p>
Owing to macros, most of Elixir, is actually implemented in Elixir, including constructs such as <code>if</code>, <code>unless</code>, or unit testing support. Unicode support works by reading UnicodeData.txt file, and generating the corresponding implementation of Unicode aware string function such as <code>downcase</code> or <code>upcase</code>. This in turn makes it easier for developers to contribute to Elixir.</p>
<p>
Macros also allow 3rd party library authors to provide internal DSLs that naturally fit in language. <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/ecto">Ecto</a> project, that provides embedded integrated queries, something like LINQ for Elixir, is my personal favorite that really showcases the power of macros.</p>
<p>
I’ve seen people sometimes dismissing Elixir, stating they don’t need metaprogramming capabilities. While extremely useful, metaprogramming can also become very dangerous tool, and it is advised to carefully consider their usage. That said, there are many features that are powered by metaprogramming, and even if you don’t write macros yourself, you’ll still probably enjoy many of these features, such as aforementioned records, Unicode support, or integrated query language.</p>
<h3>
Pipeline operator</h3>
<p>
This seemingly simple operator is so useful, I “invented” its <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/fun_chain">Erlang equivalent</a> even before I was aware it exists in Elixir (or other languages for that matter).</p>
<p>
Let’s see the problem first. In Erlang, there is no pipeline operator, and furthermore, we can’t reassign variables. Therefore, typical Erlang code will often be written with following pattern:</p>
<pre><code>State1 = trans_1(State),
State2 = trans_2(State1),
State3 = trans_3(State2),
...</code></pre>
<p>
This is a very clumsy code that relies on intermediate variables, and correct passing of the last result to the next call. I actually had a nasty bug because I accidentally used <code>State6</code> in one place instead of <code>State7</code>.</p>
<p>
Of course, we can go around by inlining function calls:</p>
<pre><code>trans_3(
  trans_2(
    trans_1(State)
  )
)</code></pre>
<p>
As you can see, this code can soon get ugly, and the problem is often aggravated when transformation functions receive additional arguments, and the number of transformation increases.</p>
<p>
The pipeline operator makes it possible to combine various operations without using intermediate variables:</p>
<pre><code><span>state</span><span>
</span><span>|&gt;</span><span> </span><span>trans_1</span><span>
</span><span>|&gt;</span><span> </span><span>trans_2</span><span>
</span><span>|&gt;</span><span> </span><span>trans_3</span></code></pre>
<p>
The code reads like the prose, from top to bottom, and highlights one of the strengths of FP, where we treat functions as data transformers that are combined in various ways to achieve the desired result.</p>
<p>
For example, the following code computes the sum of squares of all positive numbers of a list:</p>
<pre><code><span>list</span><span>
</span><span>|&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Enum</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span data-group-id="1700912354-1">(</span><span>&amp;</span><span data-group-id="1700912354-2">(</span><span>&amp;1</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span data-group-id="1700912354-2">)</span><span data-group-id="1700912354-1">)</span><span>       </span><span># take positive numbers</span><span>
</span><span>|&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Enum</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span data-group-id="1700912354-3">(</span><span>&amp;</span><span data-group-id="1700912354-4">(</span><span>&amp;1</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>&amp;1</span><span data-group-id="1700912354-4">)</span><span data-group-id="1700912354-3">)</span><span>         </span><span># square each one</span><span>
</span><span>|&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Enum</span><span>.</span><span>reduce</span><span data-group-id="1700912354-5">(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span data-group-id="1700912354-6">(</span><span>&amp;1</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>&amp;2</span><span data-group-id="1700912354-6">)</span><span data-group-id="1700912354-5">)</span><span>   </span><span># calculate sum</span></code></pre>
<p>
The pipeline operator works extremely well because the API in Elixir libraries follows the “subject (noun) as the first argument” convention. Unlike Erlang, Elixir takes the stance that all functions should take the thing they operate on as the first argument. So <code>String</code> module functions take string as the first argument, while <code>Enum</code> module functions take enumerable as the first argument.</p>
<h3>
Polymorphism via protocols</h3>
<p>
Protocols are the Elixir way of providing something roughly similar to OO interfaces. Initially, I wasn’t much impressed with them, but as the time progressed, I started seeing many benefits they bring. Protocols allow developers to create a generic logic that can be used with any type of data, assuming that some contract is implemented for the given data.</p>
<p>
An excellent example is the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html">Enum</a> module, that provides many useful functions for manipulating with anything that is enumerable. For example, this is how we iterate an enumerable:</p>
<pre><code><span>Enum</span><span>.</span><span>each</span><span data-group-id="7994075532-1">(</span><span>enumerable</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7994075532-2">fn</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7994075532-2">end</span><span data-group-id="7994075532-1">)</span></code></pre>
<p>
<code>Enum.each</code> works with different types such as lists, or key-value dictionaries, and of course we can add support for our own types by implementing corresponding protocol. This is resemblant of OO interfaces, with an additional twist that it’s possible to implement a protocol for a type, even if you don’t own its source code.</p>
<p>
One of the best example of protocol usefulness is the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html">Stream</a> module, which implements a lazy, composable, enumerable abstraction. A stream makes it possible to compose various enumerable transformations, and then generate the result only when needed, by feeding the stream to some function from the <code>Enum</code> module. For example, here’s the code that computes the sum of squares of all positive numbers of a list in a single pass:</p>
<pre><code><span>list</span><span>
</span><span>|&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Stream</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span data-group-id="8120445192-1">(</span><span>&amp;</span><span data-group-id="8120445192-2">(</span><span>&amp;1</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span data-group-id="8120445192-2">)</span><span data-group-id="8120445192-1">)</span><span>
</span><span>|&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Stream</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span data-group-id="8120445192-3">(</span><span>&amp;</span><span data-group-id="8120445192-4">(</span><span>&amp;1</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>&amp;1</span><span data-group-id="8120445192-4">)</span><span data-group-id="8120445192-3">)</span><span>
</span><span>|&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Enum</span><span>.</span><span>reduce</span><span data-group-id="8120445192-5">(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span data-group-id="8120445192-6">(</span><span>&amp;1</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>&amp;2</span><span data-group-id="8120445192-6">)</span><span data-group-id="8120445192-5">)</span><span>   </span><span># Entire iteration happens here in a single pass</span></code></pre>
<p>
In lines 2 and 3, operations are composed, but not yet executed. The result is a specification descriptor that implements an <code>Enumerable</code> protocol. Once we feed this descriptor to some <code>Enum</code> function (line 3), it starts producing values. Other than supporting protocol mechanism, there is no special laziness support from Elixir compiler.</p>
<h3>
The mix tool</h3>
<p>
The final important piece of puzzle is the tool that help us manage projects. Elixir comes bundled with the <code>mix</code> tool that does exactly that. This is again done in an impressively simple manner. When you create a new project, only 7 files are created (including .gitignore and README.md) on the disk. And this is all it takes to create a proper OTP application. It’s an excellent example of how far can things be simplified, by hiding necessary boilerplate and bureaucracy in the generic abstraction.</p>
<p>
Mix tool supports various other tasks, such as dependency management. The tool is also extensible, so you can create your own specific tasks as needed.</p>
<h3>
Syntactical changes</h3>
<p>
The list doesn’t stop here, and there are many other benefits Elixir gives us. Many of these do include syntactical changes from Erlang, such as support for variable rebinding, optional parentheses, implicit statement endings, nullability, short circuits operators, …</p>
<p>
Admittedly, some ambiguity is introduced due to optional parentheses, as illustrated in this example:</p>
<pre><code><span>abs</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>    </span><span># same as abs(-1 + 5)</span></code></pre>
<p>
However, I use parentheses (except for macros and zero arg functions), so I can’t remember experiencing this problem in practice.</p>
<p>
In general, I like many of the decision made in this department. It’s nice to be able to write <code>if</code> without obligatory <code>else</code>. It’s also nice that I don’t have to consciously think which character must I use to end the statement.</p>
<p>
Even optional parentheses are good, as they support DSL-ish usage of macros, making the code less noisy. Without them, we would have to add parentheses when invoking macros:</p>
<pre><code><span>defrecord</span><span> </span><span>User</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>age</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>       </span><span># without parentheses</span><span>

</span><span>defrecord</span><span data-group-id="6326300468-1">(</span><span>User</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6326300468-2">[</span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>age</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span data-group-id="6326300468-2">]</span><span data-group-id="6326300468-1">)</span><span>    </span><span># with parentheses</span></code></pre>
<p>
Still, I don’t find these enhancements to be of crucial importance. They are nice finishing touches, but if this was all Elixir had to offer, I’d probably still use pure Erlang.</p>
<h2>
Wrapping up</h2>
<p>
Much has been said in this article, and yet I feel that the magic of Elixir is far from being completely captured. The language preference is admittedly something subjective, but I feel that Elixir really improves on Erlang foundations. With more than three years of production level coding in Erlang, and about a year of using Elixir, I simply find Elixir experience to be much more pleasant. The resulting code seems more compact, and I can be more focused on the problem I’m solving, instead of wrestling with excessive noise and boilerplate.</p>
<p>
It is for similar reasons that I like EVM. The underlying concurrency mechanisms makes it radically easier for me to tackle complexity of a highly loaded server-side system that must constantly provide service and perform many simultaneous tasks.</p>
<p>
Both Elixir and EVM raise the abstraction bar, and help me tackle complex problems with greater ease. This is why I would always put my money behind Elixir/EVM combination as the tools of choice for building a server-side system. YMMV of course.</p>

You’d type a question, and your teacher replies by drawing a Youtube/KhanAcademy-style video; and this happens asynchronously throughout the week.</p><p>When I was studying at MIT, I often had to wait 40-60 minutes in line just to get 5 minutes of “help” from a TA - when I needed 1-2 hours. I understood that TAs can’t spend all their time helping me. That’s understandable. But what made me bitter was that, the school went the extra mile to ensure I don’t have the resources to learn on my own,</p><p>1. Blocking access to solutions for past problems (to prevent cheating)</p><p>2. Purposely not recording explanations to increase attendance: https://piazza.com/class/ky0jj3k89mz5d2/post/9</p><p>3. Insisting that Office Hours is a 1-by-1 format even when crowded (to prevent solutions from leaking)</p><p>These policies have good intentions - it’s to encourage a synchronous, in-person learning experience. But in practice, it had side-effects:</p><p>1. Help resources become inefficient - because so much material is restricted, and so much time is spent on delivering live lectures, there’d often be 40 students competing for help from 2 TAs in a 2-hour Office Hours</p><p>2. Because help resources are inefficient, it’s very hard to catch-up: once you fall behind, you have no way to review past material efficiently enough to compensate the difference - like credit card debt</p><p>3.Every day, I’d wake up, go to a lecture I don’t understand, go to Office Hours so I can hopefully ask for a review (which’d would take a few hours), realize TAs aren’t willing to do that, then realize there is nothing I can do to recover. I fell into a depression for many years, and my bitterness fueled me to work on the early versions of explanations.app</p><p>It turns out that universities succeed by being prestigious, not by teaching well. To win at prestige, be highly selective (by keeping supply low), keep a huge endowment (because it affects school rankings), and hire the best researchers (not teachers). This is actually the fundamental reason for the odd incentives in higher education, and something felt wrong.</p><p>So explanations.app is completely inspired by KhanAcademy and Youtube. The mystery to me was - why weren’t there more Youtube teachers &amp; KhanAcademy videos? I believe it’s a combination of:</p><p>1. People who teach college subjects well often have better opportunities e.g. work, research</p><p>2.  Lack of rewards: even Youtubers with 100K views and 10K subscribers would have at most 1-5 paying members on Patreon</p><p>On the one hand, there are all these free resources, where teachers changed the world way more than they ever got rewarded for. Then on the other hand, there is private tutoring - very effective - but very expensive e.g. $100/hour for college level subjects.</p><p>I believe the balanced solution is a system where lots of students pay $10/week to a few teachers who make videos, like a paid, Q&amp;A Youtube/KhanAcademy, so it’s personalized, effective, but still affordable.</p><p>There are currently 2 teachers on explanations.app - Ben &amp; Esther -  both MIT grads, teaching physics &amp; math for subjects like linear algebra and electromagnetism. 3 students - Laquazia, Lidija and Chandra from US, Serbia and Korea joined this month following r/physicsStudents launch: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/1b2t5u6/i_started_a_program_where_mit_grads_do_physics/]</p><p>While explanations.app is focused on college-level math and physics, the platform is completely open for anyone to learn and/or teach. I hope you can try it :^) and give me the chance to work with you.</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/recent-mfa-bombing-attacks-targeting-apple-users/">https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/recent-mfa-bombing-attacks-targeting-apple-users/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39836350">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>Several <strong>Apple</strong> customers recently reported being targeted in elaborate phishing attacks that involve what appears to be a bug in Apple’s password reset feature. In this scenario, a target’s Apple devices are forced to display dozens of system-level prompts that prevent the devices from being used until the recipient responds “Allow” or “Don’t Allow” to each prompt. Assuming the user manages not to fat-finger the wrong button on the umpteenth password reset request, the scammers will then call the victim while spoofing Apple support in the caller ID, saying the user’s account is under attack and that Apple support needs to “verify” a one-time code.</p>
<div id="attachment_66915"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-66915" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/patelpass.png" alt="" width="259" height="559"></p><p id="caption-attachment-66915">Some of the many notifications Patel says he received from Apple all at once.</p></div>
<p><strong>Parth Patel</strong> is an entrepreneur who is trying to build a startup in the conversational AI space. On March 23, Patel <a href="https://twitter.com/parth220_/status/1771589789143478471" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented on Twitter/X</a> a recent phishing campaign targeting him that involved what’s known as a “push bombing” or “<a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/mfa-fatigue-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MFA fatigue</a>” attack, wherein the phishers abuse a feature or weakness of a multi-factor authentication (MFA) system in a way that inundates the target’s device(s) with alerts to approve a password change or login.</p>
<p>“All of my devices started blowing up, my watch, laptop and phone,” Patel told KrebsOnSecurity. “It was like this system notification from Apple to approve [a reset of the account password], but I couldn’t do anything else with my phone. I had to go through and decline like 100-plus notifications.”</p>
<p>Some people confronted with such a deluge may eventually click “Allow” to the incessant password reset prompts — just so they can use their phone again. Others may inadvertently approve one of these prompts, which will also appear on a user’s Apple watch if they have one.</p>
<p>But the attackers in this campaign had an ace up their sleeves: Patel said after denying all of the password reset prompts from Apple, he received a call on his iPhone that said it was from Apple Support (the number displayed was 1-800-275-2273, Apple’s real customer support line).</p>
<p>“I pick up the phone and I’m super suspicious,” Patel recalled. “So I ask them if they can verify some information about me, and after hearing some aggressive typing on his end he gives me all this information about me and it’s totally accurate.”</p>
<p>All of it, that is, except his real name. Patel said when he asked the fake Apple support rep to validate the name they had on file for the Apple account, the caller gave a name that was not his but rather one that Patel has only seen in background reports about him that are for sale at a people-search website called <strong>PeopleDataLabs</strong>.</p>
<p>Patel said he has worked fairly hard to remove his information from multiple <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=people-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people-search websites</a>, and he found PeopleDataLabs uniquely and consistently listed this inaccurate name as an alias on his consumer profile.</p>
<p>“For some reason, PeopleDataLabs has three profiles that come up when you search for my info, and two of them are mine but one is an elementary school teacher from the midwest,” Patel said. “I asked them to verify my name and they said Anthony.”</p>
<p>Patel said the goal of the voice phishers is to trigger an Apple ID reset code to be sent to the user’s device, which is a text message that includes a one-time password. If the user supplies that one-time code, the attackers can then reset the password on the account and lock the user out. They can also then <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/erase-a-device-mmfc0ef36f/icloud#:~:text=Remotely%20erase%20your%20device%20or,Follow%20the%20onscreen%20instructions." target="_blank" rel="noopener">remotely wipe</a> all of the user’s Apple devices.</p>
<h2>THE PHONE NUMBER IS KEY</h2>
<p>Chris is a cryptocurrency hedge fund owner who asked that only his first name be used so as not to paint a bigger target on himself. Chris told KrebsOnSecurity he experienced a remarkably similar phishing attempt in late February.</p>
<p>“The first alert I got I hit ‘Don’t Allow’, but then right after that I got like 30 more notifications in a row,” Chris said. “I figured maybe I sat on my phone weird, or was accidentally pushing some button that was causing these, and so I just denied them all.”</p>
<p>Chris says the attackers persisted hitting his devices with the reset notifications for several days after that, and at one point he received a call on his iPhone that said it was from Apple support.</p>
<p>“I said I would call them back and hung up,” Chris said, demonstrating <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/04/when-in-doubt-hang-up-look-up-call-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the proper response to such unbidden solicitations</a>. “When I called back to the real Apple, they couldn’t say whether anyone had been in a support call with me just then. They just said Apple states very clearly that it will never initiate outbound calls to customers — unless the customer requests to be contacted.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/phonescam.png" alt="" width="749" height="472"></p>
<p>Massively freaking out that someone was trying to hijack his digital life, Chris said he changed his passwords and then went to an Apple store and bought a new iPhone. From there, he created a new Apple iCloud account using a brand new email address.</p>
<p>Chris said he then proceeded to get even more system alerts on his new iPhone and iCloud account — <em>all the while still sitting at the local Apple Genius Bar</em>.</p>
<p>Chris told KrebsOnSecurity his Genius Bar tech was mystified about the source of the alerts, but Chris said he suspects that whatever the phishers are abusing to rapidly generate these Apple system alerts requires knowing the phone number on file for the target’s Apple account. After all, that was the <em>only</em> aspect of Chris’s new iPhone and iCloud account that hadn’t changed.<span id="more-66902"></span></p>
<h2>WATCH OUT!</h2>
<p>“Ken” is a security industry veteran who spoke on condition of anonymity. Ken said he first began receiving these unsolicited system alerts on his Apple devices earlier this year, but that he has not received any phony Apple support calls as others have reported.</p>
<p>“This recently happened to me in the middle of the night at 12:30 a.m.,” Ken said. “And even though I have my Apple watch set to remain quiet during the time I’m usually sleeping at night, it woke me up with one of these alerts. Thank god I didn’t press ‘Allow,’ which was the first option shown on my watch. I had to scroll watch the wheel to see and press the ‘Don’t Allow’ button.”</p>
<div id="attachment_66911"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-66911" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/resetpassword.png" alt="" width="535" height="502"></p><p id="caption-attachment-66911">Ken shared this photo he took of an alert on his watch that woke him up at 12:30 a.m. Ken said he had to scroll on the watch face to see the “Don’t Allow” button.</p></div>
<p>Unnerved by the idea that he could have rolled over on his watch while sleeping and allowed criminals to take over his Apple account, Ken said he contacted the real Apple support and was eventually escalated to a senior Apple engineer. The engineer assured Ken that turning on an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Recovery Key</a> for his account would stop the notifications once and for all.</p>
<p>A recovery key is an optional security feature that Apple says “helps improve the security of your Apple ID account.” It is a randomly generated 28-character code, and when you enable a recovery key it is supposed to disable Apple’s standard account recovery process. The thing is, enabling it is not a simple process, and if you ever lose that code in addition to all of your Apple devices you will be permanently locked out.</p>
<p>Ken said he enabled a recovery key for his account as instructed, but that it hasn’t stopped the unbidden system alerts from appearing on all of his devices every few days.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity tested Ken’s experience, and can confirm that enabling a recovery key does nothing to stop a password reset prompt from being sent to associated Apple devices. Visiting Apple’s “forgot password” page — https://iforgot.apple.com — asks for an email address and for the visitor to solve a CAPTCHA.</p>
<p>After that, the page will display the last two digits of the phone number tied to the Apple account. Filling in the missing digits and hitting submit on that form will send a system alert, whether or not the user has enabled an Apple Recovery Key.</p>
<div id="attachment_66922"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-66922" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/applereset.png" alt="" width="680" height="552"></p><p id="caption-attachment-66922">The password reset page at iforgot.apple.com.</p></div>
<h2>RATE LIMITS</h2>
<p>What sanely designed authentication system would send dozens of requests for a password change in the span of a few moments, when the first requests haven’t even been acted on by the user? Could this be the result of a bug in Apple’s systems?</p>
<p>Apple has not yet responded to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Throughout 2022, a criminal hacking group known as <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=lapsus%24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LAPSUS$</a> used MFA bombing <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-enforces-number-matching-to-fight-mfa-fatigue-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to great effect</a> in intrusions at <strong>Cisco</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong> and <strong>Uber</strong>. In response, Microsoft began enforcing “<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-mfa-number-match" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MFA number matching</a>,” a feature that displays a series of numbers to a user attempting to log in with their credentials. These numbers must then be entered into the account owner’s Microsoft authenticator app on their mobile device to verify they are logging into the account.</p>
<p><strong>Kishan Bagaria</strong> is a hobbyist security researcher and engineer who founded the website texts.com (now owned by <a href="https://www.automattic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automattic</a>), and he’s convinced Apple has a problem on its end. In August 2019, Bagaria reported to Apple a bug that allowed an exploit he dubbed “<a href="https://kishan.org/airdos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AirDoS</a>” because it could be used to let an attacker infinitely spam all nearby iOS devices with a system-level prompt to share a file via AirDrop — a file-sharing capability built into Apple products.</p>
<p>Apple fixed that bug nearly four months later in December 2019, thanking Bagaria in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210785" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the associated security bulletin</a>. Bagaria said Apple’s fix was to add stricter rate limiting on AirDrop requests, and he suspects that someone has figured out a way to bypass Apple’s rate limit on how many of these password reset requests can be sent in a given timeframe.</p>
<p>“I think this could be a legit Apple rate limit bug that should be reported,” Bagaria said.</p>

  <p><img src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/001.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Hi, I’m excited that there are so many people interested in learning more about how and why to run SQLite in production.</p>

<p><img src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/002.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Let me start by introducing myself. My name is Stephen, and you can find me on Twitter (no, I will not call it X) at <a href="https://twitter.com/fractaledmind">fractaledmind</a>. I am an American who moved to Berlin Germany 5 years ago, and in only a few more weeks I get to marry my fiancé, who is a Russian who moved to Germany around 10 years ago. She is actually here today, and this is her first time seeing me give a conference talk. So, no pressure, right?</p>

<p>At my day job, I am the head of engineering at <a href="https://test.io/">Test IO</a>, which is a crowd-driven testing service. Then, in my spare time I am an open source developer, actively contributing to and maintaining a number of gems. I also write a fair bit on <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/">my blog</a> as I go.</p>

<p><img src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/003.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Today I want to talk about why this is how I start all of my new Rails projects, and why you might want to as well.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/004.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Specifically, I want to discuss why it might make sense to choose SQLite as your database engine. In fact, I want to even suggest that you might lean on SQLite for all of your app’s data needs. Now, whenever I suggest using SQLite in production for web applications, the primary and most common question I get is…</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/005.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Why? So, let’s explore that together. Who here is running or has run an application in production with SQLite? Who has experimented with SQLite for an app, but not shipped it to production? There are a couple hands up, but not many. So, let’s turn this question around.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/006.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Why not use SQLite in production? What are some of the reasons you haven’t considered SQLite as an option?</p>

<p>Well, the primary reason I choose SQLite is that it allows me to build useful and valuable applications quickly and to maintain them easily.</p>

<p>Why? So, let’s explore that together. Who here is running or has run an application in production with SQLite? Who has experimented with SQLite for an app, but not shipped it to production? There are a couple hands up, but not many. So, let’s turn this question around.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/007.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>In his RailsWorld keynote, DHH re-emphasized the point that Rails, at its core, is “the one-person framework”. It aims to be a bridge over complexity that allows even the smallest possible team—only you—to build full, rich, valuable web applications. And I believe that SQLite aligns perfectly with that vision. There are 3 basic reasons…</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/008.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>First is that SQLite is simple. The database is a literal file on disk. The engine is a single executable. Every aspect of the database can be fully embedded into your majestic Rails monolith.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/009.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Next, this simplicity grants you unique control. When both the storage and the engine for your database are embedded in your app, their configuration naturally lives in your app as well. Plus, because SQLite is a single executable, it is possible to fine-tune the actual compilation of that executable through Bundler. Then, having your database simply be a file permits novel and powerful developer experiences, like branch-specific databases.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/010.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Finally, SQLite is fast. When your data lives on the same machine as your application, you eliminate all network latency. You go from measuring queries in milliseconds to microseconds. Microseconds. Now, that being said, I know that there is a presumption that SQLite isn’t actually fast for web applications. One of my goals for this talk is to dispel this myth and show you that a well-tuned SQLite installation is plenty fast to drive your next big idea.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/011.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So, that is why you should consider using SQLite in production, but the real heart of the matter is how.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/012.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>And let’s start where all projects start —&nbsp;with building an MVP.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/013.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>As I said, this is how I start all of my projects lately. And once you generate your basic Rails skeleton, all you need to do is, well, build your actual application. In an earlier iteration of this talk, I was actually going to walk thru the details of building an MVP with you. But, eventually I realized that this was completely off-topic. None of the details of the MVP were specific to SQLite, and any of the details of how I organized or structured the code are distractions.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/014.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So, instead, I want to just show you a very simple MVP that I have built for this talk. We can then use this codebase as the playground for exploring how to leverage some of SQLite’s unique powers to improve our application.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/015.jpg" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>show the codebase
    <ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, that is the basic MVP that we will be working with today. It is a SQLite on Rails application that we have gotten the core functionality implemented and running on our machine. The next step is getting this application running in production, on the internet.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/016.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So, how do we deploy SQLite on Rails applications? The first and maybe most important detail here is that Heroku isn’t an option. Any hosting provider that only provides an ephemeral file system won’t work as a host for a SQLite on Rails application. Luckily though, there are a number of different hosting providers that do provide some form of persistent disk storage. fly.io, Render, and Hatchbox are two of the most popular ones in the Rails ecosystem, but I know there are others.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/017.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I personally have used (and loved) <a href="https://hatchbox.io/">Hatchbox</a> for years. So that is what I use, and that’s what I want to show you today. Hatchbox is essentially an “Ops-as-a-Service”. You bring your own server, whether a DigitalOcean droplet or a Hetzner VPS or something else, and their platform will configure the server, deploy the repo, and generally take care of going from “I don’t have an app on the internet” to “I do have an app on the internet”.</p>

<p>This is another occasion where I originally wanted to walk you thru deploying our app live, but after doing it a couple of times in preparation, I realized that I didn’t want to have us all just sitting here waiting for a server to be provisioned. So, I instead documented literally every single step and screen of the process. So, let’s walk thru a simulated live demo of deploying our MVP application to production.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/018.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>When you begin, you need to create what Hatchbox calls a “cluster”. They need to support applications that have maybe 3 servers running instances of the web app, two different servers running two different instances of Redis, each with different eviction policies, and one primary database server alongside one replica database server. Thus, they have clusters. One of my favorite aspects of a SQLite on Rails application is that we don’t need a complex network of interconnected servers to run our application. And especially at the beginning, when just trying to create something from nothing, being able to get a fully-functioning application without having to figure out all of these operational details can be the difference between shipping in days vs shipping in months.
Anyway, we will create our cluster, and use DigitalOcean as our hosting provider. In the end, our cluster will only have one server, but we need to conform to Hatchbox’s view of the world nonetheless.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/019.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We then need to connect our DigitalOcean account, to grant Hatchbox the ability to manage our DigitalOcean droplets on our behalf.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/020.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>This will take us to a DigitalOcean OAuth page where we authorize Hatchbox for whichever DigitalOcean team account we want.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/021.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Once we have authorized Hatchbox,</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/022.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We can start configuring our cluster. We first need to choose the region that our cluster will be hosted in.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/023.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>DigitalOcean offers a number of different region options.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/024.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Let’s choose Frankfurt for now. Pretty nicely centrally located.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/025.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>With that, our cluster is created, and so we need to add a server to our cluster next.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/026.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>As Hatchbox will remind us, we minimally need a server with two core responsibilities—run our web app and run cron.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/027.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Let’s create a single server with both responsibilities.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/028.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>With that done, we can consider what size of server we want.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/029.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>DigitalOcean’s Frankfurt region has a number of different server size options.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/030.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The largest option in this region goes up to 32GB of RAM, 8 CPUs, and is $192 a month. For our MVP though, let’s start with the smallest, simplest, cheapest option.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/031.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Now, Hatchbox will begin creating and provisioning our server.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/032.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>You can tail the logs of what precisely Hatchbox is doing if you’d like.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/033.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>But once it has created the server on Digital Ocean, it will begin provisioning it.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/034.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>That can take some time—in this case around 10 minutes, but once it is done, we can begin creating our App to deploy to this server on this cluster.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/035.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>When we navigate to the “Apps” tab, we can create a new app.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/036.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>You give the app a name and choose which cluster it should be deployed to.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/037.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We want our new app to deploy to our new cluster.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/038.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>When we tell Hatchbox to create this app,</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/039.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>it will ask us for the repository information. If you are just starting, you can connect their GitHub app to your GitHub account.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/040.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Or, if you are using some other git host, or you have already installed their GitHub app</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/041.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>You can just choose that.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/042.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Provide the repo name and branch name, and that’s it.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/043.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Now, we just need to deploy our new app to our new server.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/044.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Again, Hatchbox handles the details here. And, again, you can tail the logs to see precisely what it is doing if you’d like.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/045.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>After a few minutes, your app will be deployed. You can now view that app running on a Hatchbox subdomain.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/046.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Congrats! As quickly and easily as that, you have a production SQLite on Rails application running. And I really want to emphasize just how quick and easy that was. In preparing this talk, I quite literally built and deployed this demo app in a single day. And I am running that app on a DigitalOcean droplet that costs $4 a month. And DigitalOcean gives you $200 dollars in credit when you first sign up. This is the beauty and promise of the majestic monolith—when your entire operational setup is embedded in your app repository, simple and consistent deployment becomes possible. Then, with a SQLite on Rails application, you can also make this simple deployment cheap. Great for MVPs and R&amp;D projects. But I can already imagine what some of you are likely thinking: “Sure, it is technically running, but is it actually usable?” Let’s check.
I’d love for anyone with a phone or laptop to head to <a href="https://demo.sqliteonrails.com/">demo.sqliteonrails.com</a> and just click around. Does it feel useable? I’ll explore myself here on the conference wifi from Taipei hitting the server in Frankfurt.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/047.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We can also run our benchmarks to get a sense of our performance. I ran our different benchmarking scenarios against increasingly concurrent load. I ran each request twice as well to get a bit more variability for the averages. And, taking the overall average across every scenario and every concurrency setting, we get just over 20 requests per second.</p>

<p>Now, to be fair, I did run all of these benchmarks from my laptop sitting in Berlin. And we deployed our app to Frankfurt. Of course, the app will be slower from here in Taiwan. Let’s see how much slower.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/048.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I ran the balanced benchmark from my hotel last night. Again, I ran it against increasingly concurrent load and ran each scenario twice. Taking the overall average, we get 14 requests per second. Sure, these aren’t staggeringly large numbers, but we were all using the app and saw that it was completely useable. Let’s put this in context.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/049.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Earlier this week <a href="https://x.com/fractaledmind/status/1731988289349931080?s=20">I asked</a> for some anecdotal information about average and peak load for real, valuable production Rails apps. Here are the 6 replies I got. Does our demo work for the busiest half of these examples? No. But, the critical point here is that I built a working application, deployed to the smallest and cheapest server available, I’m running it in a single region on that tiny cheap server, and it is still totally useable. Useable enough to start making actual money.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/050.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>It is so easy for us engineers to get lost in trying to do things the “right way” that we lose sight of the value and importance of just doing things at all. Especially when working on a side-project that isn’t just a learning exercise or an R&amp;D project at work, don’t lose time to trying to have an app that handles large scale that it simply won’t get at first. Ship, and ship quickly. This is a completely vanilla Rails app deployed on a completely vanilla and tiny DigitalOcean droplet via a completely vanilla Hatchbox process. One day of work in total. One single day. This is the single most important point I hope you take home with you from this talk. A SQLite on Rails application is good enough. Ship it.</p>

<p>That being said, this hasn’t always been the case. The out-of-the-box experience for SQLite on Rails applications wasn’t production ready even 3 months ago. So, there is some legitimacy to the presumption that people have had that SQLite can’t back production web applications. I hope I’ve shown you, though, that today it can.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/051.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So, I want to briefly explain why our vanilla Rails app was useable in production on day one, because that certainly wasn’t always the case. Starting with Rails 7.1, we are applying a better default configuration for your SQLite database. These changes are central to making SQLite work well in the context of a web application. And the reality is, if you had tried to run a SQLite on Rails application in production before Rails 7.1, you likely did have a more difficult time and your performance wasn’t at a baseline of good enough. So I understand why and how this belief that SQLite can’t work in production for your Rails application came from. But, it is important that we don’t let our opinions formed in the past go unchallenged in the present. We have been doing a lot of work to make the out-of-the-box experience of SQLite on Rails applications noticeably better. If you’d like to learn more about what each of these configuration options are, why we use the values we do, and how this specific collection of configuration details improve things, I have <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/09/07/enhancing-rails-sqlite-fine-tuning/">a blog post</a> that digs into these details.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/052.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Another factor in ensuring that the default experience of SQLite on Rails applications is high quality is the default compilation settings of the SQLite executable itself. Mike Dalessio is the current maintainer of the sqlite3-ruby gem, and he and I have worked together to find the minimal default configuration for the executable that has the best default performance experience. When you install SQLite thru the Ruby gem, it is compiled to use the write ahead log and include the full text search extension. Again, more details on compilation settings and why we use the values we do are in <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/09/10/enhancing-rails-sqlite-optimizing-compilation/">my blog post</a>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/053.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Now, that being said, we all are hoping that our side-projects will take off somehow to some degree, so we want to know that a SQLite on Rails application can “scale”. And while I do genuinely believe that 10 to 20 requests per second is good enough for shipping an MVP on the smallest cheapest server possible, this stack isn’t viable if it can’t grow as our app and usage grows. So, let’s talk some about how to enhance the power of our SQLite database and our SQLite on Rails application. Plus, I want to show you some of the ways you can take advantage of SQLite’s unique design to make your life and your application better.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/054.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The first thing you should do when you start “scaling” your app is to install the enhanced adapter gem. While the default configuration for a Rails app is notably better today than it was even just 3 months ago, Rails moves relatively slowly, and there are improvements that we as a community have proven out that aren’t yet in Rails core. Or, there are some improvements that are currently in Rails core, but we want to make them available to all Rails apps at least on version 7.1. So, I created the <a href="https://github.com/fractaledmind/activerecord-enhancedsqlite3-adapter">enhanced adapter gem</a>, which when added to your application will automatically, well, <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/10/09/sqlite-on-rails-enhanced-sqlite3-adapter/">enhance your SQLite database</a>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/055.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>How does it enhance it? Well, in 5 ways. It ensures that some ActiveRecord features are present that weren’t released as a part of Rails 7.1 (tho both should be in Rails 7.1.3, and both are (as of yesterday) currently in Rails main). It then also powers up the <code>database.yml</code> file to allow for you to fine-tune your SQLite configuration and also load SQLite extensions, directly from the database.yml file. But, probably most importantly, it improves how your SQLite on Rails application handles concurrent load. I want to highlight two of these features today, to demonstrate some of the more powerful and useful enhancements that the gem provides.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/056.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>First, it is now easy to install and <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/09/08/enhancing-rails-sqlite-loading-extensions/">load SQLite extensions</a> into your app. In this example, I am installing and loading the vector similarly search extension for SQLite. Yes, you can integrate vector similarly search into your SQLite on Rails application. This makes it possible to implement a Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) AI feature into your Rails application. pgvector isn’t the only kid on the block. For those of you in Andrei Bondarev’s talk this morning on catching the AI train, this should be of particular interest.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/057.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>But, my favorite feature of the gem is its <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/12/11/sqlite-on-rails-improving-concurrency/">improved concurrency support</a>. And why is this important? The first lever you should pull as you start to scale your application is increasing concurrency. The simplest first thing to do is to scale your server to one that has multiple cores such that Puma naturally runs in clustered mode, spinning up multiple Puma workers to server your app’s requests. The reality is that the out-of-the-box experience for SQLite on Rails applications today isn’t well suited for concurrent workloads. Let’s do some quick local benchmarking to see how.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/058.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So, what’s going on here? How is the enhanced adapter so radically improving how our application handles concurrent workloads? I don’t have time to go into great detail here, but you can read my recent blogpost on the topic linked via the QR code. The short explanation is that the gem defines a custom timeout handler that will release the GIL while waiting for a connection. Plus, we ensure that all transactions will use this custom timeout handler. And, this feature will eventually be upstreamed into Rails, but you can get it today via the enhanced adapter gem.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/059.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Beyond the default compilation configuration, we can <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/09/10/enhancing-rails-sqlite-optimizing-compilation/">enhance the compilation settings</a> for the SQLite executable for our specific application as well. SQLite has lots of compilation options. But, for modern web applications, these are the compilation options that the SQLite documentation itself recommends. They are particularly useful when you need to extract every possible bit of performance out of SQLite for your app.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/060.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Beyond just enhancing the default SQLite setup, we can also extend how our app uses SQLite, taking advantage of some of its unique characteristics.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/061.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>For example, this is one of my favorite developer experience improvements that SQLite makes so easy. You can get <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/09/06/enhancing-rails-sqlite-branch-databases/">isolated databases for each git branch</a> in your repository, so that you never get schema conflicts as you checkout different branches throughout your workday. And I just love that this massive improvement to your daily development experience is literally just a 2-line change.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/062.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Plus, one of the most important details for a production SQLite on Rails system is to have a backup procedure in place. The <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/09/09/enhancing-rails-sqlite-setting-up-litestream/">Litestream utility</a> allows you to stream every update to your SQLite database (or databases) to any of a number of bucket storage systems. And, as of Wednesday, there is now <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/12/12/sqlite-on-rails-litestream-ruby/">a Ruby gem</a> that will install the executable into your app. Then, you can run the installer to get it integrated into your Rails app as well.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/063.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Finally, you can take advantage of SQLite’s speed and simplicity to simply use SQLite as your backend for all of the Rails components that need some kind of persistent data</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/064.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/oldmoe/litestack">Litestack</a> offers SQLite-backed, fine-tuned implementations of each of these data-bound components. This allows you to keep the operational simplicity of your majestic SQLite on Rails monolith while also building out a truly full-featured Rails application.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/065.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>In the end, I hope that this exploration of the tools, techniques, and defaults for SQLite on Rails applications has shown you how powerful, performant, and flexible this approach is. Rails is legitimately the best web application framework for working with SQLite today. The community’s growing ecosystem of tools and gems is unparalleled. And today is absolutely the right time to start a SQLite on Rails application and explore these things for yourself.</p>

<p><a href="https://hothardware.com/news/controversy-google-ai-image-tool-gemini">AI image generators</a> typically work through a process known as "diffusion". Basically, the model that's generating the image starts with a very vague, blurry picture, and successive sampling steps refine the image until it's sharp and realistic—or at least, as real as the model can get for what you've prompted. Diffusion is usually a time-consuming process requiring lots of steps, but MIT researchers have found a better way.</p>

<p><a href="https://hothardware.com/photo-gallery/NewsItem/64189?image=big_dmd-method.jpg&amp;tag=popup" target="_blank"><img height="231px" width="708px" alt="dmd method" data-src="https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/64189/content/small_dmd-method.jpg" src="https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/64189/content/small_dmd-method.jpg"></a><br>
</p>
<p>
Using a new approach called "distribution matching distillation", researchers from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory have managed to reduce the diffusion process down to a single sampling step. Obviously, this is much faster than having to <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/dall-e-ai-art-generator-open-for-public-with-improved-safety-systems">iterate on the image</a> thirty to fifty times as you usually do with typical image diffusion processes. The results produced aren't bad, either; take a look:</p><p><img height="397px" width="708px" alt="dmd vs sd" data-src="https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/64189/content/dmd-vs-sd.jpg" src="https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/64189/content/dmd-vs-sd.jpg"><br>
</p>
<p>
There's a video, too, which evocatively showcases the performance improvement. While Stable Diffusion 1.5 takes around a second and a half to distill an image on modern hardware, MIT's new DMD-based model takes around five hundredths of a second. The video allows a few images from SD 1.5 to fill in before rapidly spitting out a whole litany of pictures from the new model. Check it out:</p>

This isn't the first time people have tried to use diffusion distillation to accelerate image generation; models like Instaflow and LCM have tried the same thing as MIT's DMD with at-times <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/controversy-google-ai-image-tool-gemini">questionable results</a>. Like with most things in computing, it's a trade-off between quality and performance. MIT's new method seems to offer the best of both worlds, with a balance between speed and resolved image detail.</p><p><img height="264px" width="708px" alt="cat comparison" data-src="https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/64189/content/cat-comparison.jpg" src="https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/64189/content/cat-comparison.jpg"><br>
</p>

<p>
This also isn't the first time that people have figured out how to do diffusion in far fewer steps; notably, <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/stable-diffusion-3-announced">Stability AI itself created</a> a model called Stable Diffusion Turbo that can generate 1-megapixel images in a single diffusion step, although the results tend to be better with a few extra steps. Stable Diffusion Turbo works in a very similar manner to MIT's "DMD" approach; it uses a smaller model trained on Stable Diffusion XL output to "lead" the Turbo model toward what the full SDXL model would produce.</p>

<p>
We have to salute the efforts of developers working on AI technologies who release their work publicly. While image generators like DALL-E and <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/imagine-meta-ai-images">Meta AI's Imagine</a> can produce extremely impressive results, these groups are highly protective of their technology and jealously guard it from curious public eyes.

ARPA-H is a federal funding agency that funds transformative biomedical and health research breakthroughs, rapidly translating research from the lab to applications in the marketplace.&nbsp;</span></p>
</section>
<section about="" typeof="">
			<h2>The Award</h2>
		<p><span>The award, part of the ARPA-H’s Novel Innovations for Tissue Regeneration in Osteoarthritis (</span><a href="https://arpa-h.gov/research-and-funding/programs/nitro" rel="nofollow"><span>NITRO</span></a><span>) program, will support the development of NOVAJoint, a revolutionary biocompatible, low-cost, patient-specific knee joint replacement. This high-risk project builds upon more than two decades of collaborative musculoskeletal research at Columbia in engineering and medicine, and promises to offer a transformative solution for the more than thirty million people in the U.S. who suffer from osteoarthritis. NITRO is the first Health Science Futures specific program under the new ARPA-H agency, established by the Biden Administration.</span></p>

<p><span>The project is led by</span><a href="https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/clark-hung" rel="nofollow"> <span>Clark T. Hung</span></a><span>, </span>Professor and Vice Chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Professor of Orthopedic Science (in Orthopedic Surgery) at Columbia Engineering<span>, and</span><a href="https://www.columbiaortho.org/profile/nadeen-o-chahine-phd" rel="nofollow"> <span>Nadeen O.

			<h2>Impact of Osteoarthritis</h2>
		<p><span>Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that is the most common type of arthritis. It gradually worsens over time as cartilage, the specialized connective tissue that covers the ends of bones, wears down, leading to pain, stiffness, and loss of mobility. Osteoarthritis is already the third most common type of disability and has an estimated economic burden of more than $136 billion per year. </span><span>It disproportionately affects women, the elderly, certain racial/ethnic minorities, and those with lower socioeconomic status. </span><span>The prevalence of knee osteoarthritis has been rising due to aging of the population, increasing rates of joint injury, and, significantly, obesity.</span></p>

<p><span>The clinical gold standard treatment for knee joints ravaged by pervasive OA or traumatic injury is a total joint replacement using prosthetic implants made of metal and plastic. Although knee replacement is widely successful, there are some major drawbacks to these conventional materials. There can be life-changing complications and limitations of current artificial knee replacements, including infection, loosening, hardware failure, stiffness, abnormal kinematics (i.e., the way a knee moves), instability, and persistent pain. Historically, knee replacements have had a limited lifespan with a portion failing at 15 to 20 years due to plastic wear or implant loosening. This means that younger patients may need one or even two revision implants. The demand for total knee replacements is projected to grow by 673% -- 3.48 million procedures from 2005 to 2030 -- with total knee revisions projected to grow 601% between 2005 to 2030.&nbsp;</span></p>
</section>
<section about="" typeof="">
			<h2>NOVAJoint — a living solution to ravaged knees</h2>
		<p><span>With the ARPA-H award, the researchers propose to design NOVAJoint to address the urgent, unmet clinical need for a permanent solution for patients with advanced OA where a conventional knee replacement is indicated. The project’s goal is to develop a replacement knee of regenerated living cartilage and bone that integrates seamlessly with the native bone and restores pain-free joint function. Since cells are required to regenerate and maintain this living implant, the team will create two versions of NOVAJoint: a version that uses patient’s own cells and one that uses donor cells. The researchers expect NOVAJoint to substantially extend the implant life, reducing complications, and to become a permanent and final procedure for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee.&nbsp; With an aggressive timeline, in the first two years, the team will create the first prototypes before moving into preclinical and clinical studies in the final three years, including a Phase 1 safety clinical trial in the final year.</span></p>

<p><span>Though the first NOVAJoint is still in development, many of the technologies and scientific discoveries necessary to create the joint have already been developed and validated by Columbia researchers through funding from the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Department of Defense, and institutional support.</span></p>

<p><span>“The ARPA-H NITRO program has enabled us to leverage our innovative technologies and expertise to solve one of the most difficult challenges in biomedical engineering,” said Hung, a groundbreaking researcher in musculoskeletal regeneration.</span></p>
</section>
<section about="" typeof="">
			<h2>The Collaborators</h2>
		<p><span>The NOVAJoint team will fabricate a living knee replacement using modern manufacturing techniques and capitalizes on the critical mass of musculoskeletal researchers at Columbia with collective expertise in biomechanics, biomaterials, stem cells, and orthopedic surgery from across the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and College of Dental Medicine, building on a decades-long history of collaboration between the Departments of Orthopedic Surgery and Biomedical Engineering. The project team is multidisciplinary, with scientific leadership from faculty in the Departments of Biomedical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Orthopedic Surgery, and Dental Medicine. Co-PIs and Task Leads include Treena Arinzeh, Professor of Biomedical Engineering; Gerard Ateshian, Andrew Walz Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Professor of Biomedical Engineering;&nbsp; Alice Huang, Associate Professor of Bioengineering (in Orthopedic Surgery); and Roshan Shah, Russell A. Hibbs Associate Professor of Orthopedics (in Orthopedic Surgery) and Director of Complex Reconstruction; Chang Lee, Associate Professor of Craniofacial Engineering (in Dental Medicine).</span></p>

<p><span>Working with the Columbia team is James L. Cook, William &amp; Kathryn Allen Distinguished Chair in Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Missouri, who will lead preclinical testing. Drs. Cook and Shah will also lead the clinical trial, which will be recruiting patients at both universities. The team is partnering with New York Stem Cell Foundation and New York Blood Center for GMP manufacturing of NOVAJoint.</span></p>

<p><span>“This is a big challenge, but by creating a large and experienced team that works well together and can be focused on one goal, we expect to succeed,” said Chahine, a leader in orthopedic research. “NOVAJoint will mark a major milestone in the field of regenerative medicine and orthopedic surgery, and has the potential to revolutionize musculoskeletal treatments of the many joints that degenerate with age or injury.”</span></p>
</section>
<section about="" typeof="">
			<h2>Equity and Commercialization</h2>
		<p><span>In addition to the advancement in science, equity and commercialization are key pillars to the programmatic success of this project. Part of NITRO’s vision is to establish a clear path to commercialization, which is a prerequisite for successful clinical translation and impact of disruptive technologies such as NOVAJoint. ARPA-H has a firm commitment to equitable healthcare access for all, irrespective of race, ethnicity, gender/gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, geography, employment, insurance, and socioeconomic status.</span></p>

<p><span>“Our goal is to push knee replacement to its next stage of evolution and to create a better solution to osteoarthritis for all Americans. Every day patients ask me about new advancements in knee replacement surgery, hoping for validation of their years of suffering before seeking care,” says Dr. Shah.&nbsp; “Now I have something to tell them. I think the big orthopedic companies will be watching this project closely, and will be vying for the chance to commercialize NOVAJoint nationally.”</span></p>

<p><span>In order to meet these programmatic goals, the team will also be leveraging the expertise and resources of the</span><a href="https://www.irvinginstitute.columbia.edu/" rel="nofollow"> <span>Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research</span></a><span> and</span><a href="https://techventures.columbia.edu/" rel="nofollow"> <span>Columbia Technology Ventures</span></a><span>. The NOVAJoint team will include a full-time Equity Officer who will help develop key equity performance indicators. The equity officer will work closely with </span><span>Rachel C. Shelton</span><span>, Associate Professor of Sociomedical Sciences at Mailman School of Public Health and co-director of the Irving Institute’s</span><a href="https://www.irvinginstitute.columbia.edu/about-us/resources-and-cores/community-engagement-core-resource-cecr" rel="nofollow"> <span>Community Engagement Core Resource</span></a><span> (CECR) and Lisa Royse, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Missouri, to foster research conducted in partnership with community stakeholders to better inform the application of scientific findings to clinical and community settings.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">In 2016, Facebook launched a secret project designed to intercept and decrypt the network traffic between people using Snapchat’s app and its servers. The goal was to understand users’ behavior and help Facebook compete with Snapchat, according to newly unsealed court documents. Facebook called this “Project Ghostbusters,” in a clear reference to Snapchat’s ghost-like logo.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a federal court in California released new documents discovered as part of the class action lawsuit between consumers and Meta, Facebook’s parent company.</p>
<p>The newly released documents reveal how Meta tried to gain a competitive advantage over its competitors, including Snapchat and later Amazon and YouTube, by analyzing the network traffic of how its users were interacting with Meta’s competitors. Given these apps’ use of encryption, Facebook needed to develop special technology to get around it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24515959-facebookmeta-class-action-discovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One of the documents</a> details Facebook’s Project Ghostbusters. The project was part of the company’s In-App Action Panel (IAPP) program, which used a technique for “intercepting and decrypting” encrypted app traffic from users of Snapchat, and later from users of YouTube and Amazon, the consumers’ lawyers wrote in the document.</p>
<p>The document includes internal Facebook emails discussing the project.</p>
<p>“Whenever someone asks a question about Snapchat, the answer is usually that because their traffic is encrypted we have no analytics about them,” Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg wrote in an email dated June 9, 2016, which was published as part of the lawsuit. “Given how quickly they’re growing, it seems important to figure out a new way to get reliable analytics about them. Perhaps we need to do panels or write custom software. You should figure out how to do this.”</p>
<p>Facebook’s engineers solution was to use <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/onavo/">Onavo</a>, a VPN-like service that Facebook acquired in 2013. In 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/21/facebook-removes-onavo/">Facebook shut down Onavo</a> after a TechCrunch investigation revealed that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/">Facebook had been secretly paying teenagers to use Onavo</a> so the company could access all of their web activity.</p>
<p>After Zuckerberg’s email, the Onavo team took on the project and a month later proposed a solution: so-called kits that can be installed on iOS and Android that intercept traffic for specific subdomains, “allowing us to read what would otherwise be encrypted traffic so we can measure in-app usage,” read an email from July 2016. “This is a ‘man-in-the-middle’ approach.”</p>

<p>A man-in-the-middle attack — nowadays also called adversary-in-the-middle — is an attack where hackers intercept internet traffic flowing from one device to another over a network. When the network traffic is unencrypted, this type of attack allows the hackers to read the data inside, such as usernames, passwords, and other in-app activity.</p>
<p>Given that Snapchat encrypted the traffic between the app and its servers, this network analysis technique was not going to be effective. This is why Facebook engineers proposed using Onavo, which when activated had the advantage of reading all of the device’s network traffic before it got encrypted and sent over the internet.</p>
<p>“We now have the capability to measure detailed in-app activity” from “parsing snapchat [sic] analytics collected from incentivized participants in Onavo’s research program,” read another email.</p>
<p>Later, according to the court documents, Facebook expanded the program to Amazon and YouTube.</p>
<p>Inside Facebook, there wasn’t a consensus on whether Project Ghostbusters was a good idea. Some employees, including Jay Parikh, Facebook’s then-head of infrastructure engineering, and Pedro Canahuati, the then-head of security engineering, expressed their concern.</p>
<p>“I can’t think of a good argument for why this is okay. No security person is ever comfortable with this, no matter what consent we get from the general public. The general public just doesn’t know how this stuff works,” Canahuati wrote in an email, included in the court documents.</p>
<p>In 2020, Sarah Grabert and Maximilian Klein <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2020/12/class-action-lawsuit-against-facebook-alleges-anticompetitive-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a class action lawsuit against Facebook</a>, claiming that the company lied about its data collection activities and exploited the data it “deceptively extracted” from users to identify competitors and then unfairly fight against these new companies.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.</p>
<p>Google, Meta, and Snap did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>In the small Appalachian city of Bristol, Virginia, City Council member Neal Osborne left a meeting on the morning of Jan. 3 and rushed himself to the hospital.</p>







<p>Osborne, 36, has Type 1 diabetes. His insulin pump had malfunctioned, and without a steady supply of this essential hormone, Osborne’s blood sugar skyrocketed and his body was shutting down.</p>



<p>Osborne went to the nearest hospital, Bristol Regional Medical Center. He said he settled into a wheelchair in the emergency room waiting area, where over the next few hours he drifted in and out of consciousness and retched up vomit, then bile, then blood. After 12 hours in the waiting room, Osborne said, he was moved to an ER bed, where he stayed until he was sent to the intensive care unit the next day. In total, the council member was in the ER for about 30 hours, he said.</p>



<p>Osborne said his ordeal echoes stories he’s heard from constituents for years. In his next crisis, Osborne said, he plans to leave Bristol for an ER about two hours away.</p>



<p>“I want to go to Knoxville or I want to go to Roanoke, because I do not want to further risk my life and die at a Ballad hospital,” he said. “The wait times just to get in and see a doctor in the ER have grown exponentially.”</p>



<p>Ballad Health, a 20-hospital system in the Tri-Cities region of Tennessee and Virginia, benefits from the <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/appalachia-ballad-health-copa-monopoly-charity-care-quality/">largest state-sanctioned hospital monopoly</a> in the United States. In the six years since lawmakers in both states waived anti-monopoly laws and Ballad was formed, ER visits for patients sick enough to be hospitalized grew more than three times as long and now far exceed the criteria set by state officials, according to <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/tn/health/health-program-areas/health-planning/certificate-of-public-advantage/redir-copa/copa-reports.html">Ballad reports</a> released by the Tennessee Department of Health.</p>












<p>Tennessee and Virginia have so far announced no steps to reduce time spent in Ballad ERs. The Tennessee health department, which has a more direct role in regulating Ballad, has each year issued a report saying the agreement that gave Ballad a monopoly “continues to provide a Public Advantage.” Department officials have twice declined to comment to KFF Health News on Ballad’s performance.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24480905-ballad_health_fy23_copa_reports">Ballad’s latest annual report</a>, which was released this month and spans from July 2022 to June 2023, the median time that patients spend in Ballad ERs before being admitted to the hospital is nearly 11 hours. This statistic includes both time spent waiting and time being treated in the ER and excludes patients who weren’t admitted or left the ER without receiving care.</p>



<p>The federal government once tracked ER speed the same way. When compared against the latest <a href="https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/archived-data/hospitals">corresponding federal data</a> from 2019, which includes more than 4,000 hospitals but predates the covid-19 pandemic, Ballad ranks among the 100 hospitals with the slowest ERs. More current federal data is not available because the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services retired this statistic in 2020 in favor of other measurements.</p>



<p>Newer data tells a similar story. The Joint Commission, a nonprofit that accredits health care organizations, collected this same measurement for 2022 from about 250 hospitals that volunteered the data, finding a median ER speed of five hours and 41 minutes — or about five hours faster than Ballad’s latest annual report.</p>



<p>Ballad Health spokesperson Molly Luton said in an email statement that, by holding patients in the ER, where they are observed while waiting for a bed, Ballad avoids “overwhelming” its staff. Luton said ER delays are also caused by two nationwide crises: a nursing shortage and fewer admissions at nursing homes and similar facilities, which can create a backlog of patients awaiting discharge from the hospital.</p>



<p>Luton added that Ballad’s ER time for admitted patients has dropped to about 7½ hours in the months since the company’s latest annual report.</p>



<p>“On those issues Ballad Health can directly control, our performance has rebounded from 2022, and is now among the best in the nation,” Luton said.</p>



<p>Luton also noted that Ballad performs better than or close to the national average on several other measurements of ER performance, including having fewer patients who leave without being treated. CMS data shows the national average is about 3%. Ballad reported 1.4% in its latest annual report.</p>



<p>Osborne, the Bristol council member, attributed this statistic to Ballad’s monopoly.</p>



<p>“Just because they aren’t leaving the ER doesn’t mean they are happy where they are,” he said. “It just means they don’t have anywhere else they could be.”</p>

<p><strong>Ballad’s Big Monopoly</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>Ballad Health was formed in 2018 after state officials approved the nation’s biggest hospital merger based on a so-called Certificate of Public Advantage, or COPA, agreement. COPAs have been used in about 10 hospital mergers over the past three decades, but none has involved as many hospitals as Ballad’s.</p>



<p>State lawmakers in Tennessee and Virginia waived federal anti-monopoly laws so rival hospital systems — Mountain States Health Alliance and Wellmont Health System — could merge into a single company with no competition. Ballad is now the only option for hospital care for most of about 1.1 million residents in a 29-county region at the nexus of Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, and North Carolina.</p>



<p>The Federal Trade Commission warns that hospital monopolies lead to increased prices and decreased quality of care. To offset the perils of Ballad’s monopoly, officials required the new company to commit to a long list of special conditions, including dozens of quality-care metrics spelled out with specific benchmarks.</p>



<p>In its latest annual report, Ballad improved on many quality-of-care metrics over the prior year, including several that the company prioritized, but still fell short on 56 of 75 benchmarks.</p>



<p>ER time for admitted patients is one of those. The benchmark was set at three hours and 47 minutes in the original COPA agreement. Ballad met or nearly met this goal for three years, according to its annual reports. Then the ERs slowed.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24480925-fy21-ballad-health-copa-annual-report">2022</a>, Ballad reported a median ER time for admitted patients of about six hours.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24480923-ballad-health-fy22-copa">2023</a>, it reported the same statistic at seven hours and 40 minutes.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24480905-ballad_health_fy23_copa_reports">the latest report</a>, ER time for admitted patients had reached 10 hours and 45 minutes.</p>



<p>CMS, which grades thousands of hospitals nationwide, <a href="https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/topics/hospitals/timely-effective-care#emergency-department-care">warns on its website</a> that timely ER care is “essential for good patient outcomes,” and that more time spent in the ER has been linked to higher complication rates and delays in patients getting pain medication and antibiotics.</p>



<p>Ben Harder, chief of health analysis for U.S. News &amp; World Report, said extensive ER times can be a symptom of slowdowns throughout a hospital, including in the operating room.</p>



<p>“A long delay in getting patients admitted is both a risk in itself, in that a test may not get conducted as promptly,” Harder said. “But it’s also an indication that the hospital is backed up, and that there are problems getting patients moved from one unit to another.”</p>



<p>Bill Christian, a spokesperson for the Tennessee Department of Health, said Ballad’s rising ER times had been “noted” but did not say if the agency had taken or was considering any action. Christian directed questions about Ballad’s latest stats to the company itself.</p>



<p><strong>‘A Nightmare for Community Members’</strong></p>



<p>Ballad has also fallen short — by about $191 million over the past five years — of its obligation to Tennessee to provide charity care, which is free or discounted care for low-income patients, according to health department documents and Ballad’s latest report. The health department <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23929508-ballad-health-charity-care-waiver-letters">waived this obligation</a> in each of the past four fiscal years. Ballad has said it would ask for another this year.</p>



<p>In a two-hour interview last year, Ballad CEO Alan Levine defended his company and said that because the Tri-Cities region could not support two competing hospital companies, the COPA merger had likely prevented at least three hospital closures. Levine attributed Ballad’s failure to meet quality benchmarks to the pressure of the covid pandemic and said charity care shortfalls were partly caused by Medicaid changes beyond Ballad’s control.</p>



<p>“Our critics say, ‘No Ballad. We don’t want Ballad.’ Well, then what?” Levine said. “Because the hospitals were on their way to being closed.”</p>



<p>Some residents see Ballad as a savior. John King, who runs a physical therapy clinic in the core of Ballad’s region, said at a <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/copa/COPA-meeting-TRANSCRIPT-6-12-23.pdf">public hearing last June</a> that in multiple visits to Ballad ERs, including one for a stroke, he found their care to be quick and compassionate.</p>



<p>“If it weren’t for Ballad Health, I literally would not be here today,” King said, according to a hearing transcript.</p>



<p>Ballad’s failures to live up to the terms of the COPA agreement were detailed in a <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/appalachia-ballad-health-copa-monopoly-charity-care-quality/">KFF Health News investigation</a> last September, and the company faced a new wave of criticism in the months that followed.</p>



<p>Local leaders in Carter County, Tennessee, in October debated but did not pass a resolution calling for Ballad to be better regulated or broken up. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, a Republican, said in an <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2023/11/06/tenn-attorney-general-urges-close-look-at-ballad-health-operations-amid-community-concerns-over-monopoly-deal/">interview with the Tennessee Lookout</a> published in November that Ballad must be constantly monitored in light of community complaints. Earlier this month, Tennessee state Rep. David Hawk (R-Greeneville), who represents a region within Ballad’s monopoly, called for Levine’s resignation, according to wjhl.com.</p>



<p>In response, Ballad Health said in a statement it has “strong relationships with the majority of elected officials” in Carter County and welcomed scrutiny from the Tennessee attorney general. Ballad said Hawk’s “opinion certainly does not reflect our broader relationships” within the area. Tennessee lawmakers are also considering legislation to <a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=HB2600&amp;ga=113">forbid future COPA mergers</a> in the state, which Ballad said “risks putting more hospitals at risk for closure.”</p>



<p>The bill was introduced by state Sen. Heidi Campbell (D-Nashville) and state Rep. Gloria Johnson (D-Knoxville), who is running for the U.S. Senate. Johnson said the bill would end Ballad’s protection from antitrust laws.</p>



<p>“It’s just been a nightmare for community members out there,” Johnson said. “And they have no other option.”</p>

I left this past February having screened nearly 500,000 comments about the recently deceased.</p><p>My main responsibility was to keep a queue system of differently labeled, never-ending condolences safe and sugarcoated. Surprisingly, I was rarely bombarded with violent or pornographic messages. Mostly, I deleted spam.</p><p>In January 2018, after a dozen years on the peripheries of indie music and freelance writing, I needed some reliable income and applied to an unusual job screening online content in the death industry. Online memorials have existed since at least the 1990s, offering a place for mourners to pay their respects digitally. Over the decades, they have become a familiar part of the modern grieving process – and a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/morbid-war-online-obituaries/" data-link-name="in body link">big source of traffic</a> for the companies that provide them, ranging from funeral homes to Facebook.</p><p>An apt typo would break up the dark, sloppy tediousness of death work. (A recent favorite: “timbering” loved ones instead of “remembering” them.) Lately, with the freshly bereaved writing condolences on iPhones, sympathy notes are freighted more with autocorrect than grief. For example: “No words to describe this terrible trade gym.” Or: “During this difficult time, hang onto all the find meteorites.”</p><p>When I mention this job to others, I’m immediately asked to reveal the most offensive sympathy note I’ve read. Here’s one that’s safe to print in a family publication: “I know it’s last minute, but are you available to come cut the grass at the house today? Mainly the front please”. (And another gem: “Burrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrp”.)</p><p>Commenters often use the guestbook section as they might use social media, sharing work gossip, relationship spats and health updates. From the condolence screener’s laptop, however, there is one big everyday obstacle with monitoring small dispatches of daily life: we aren’t allowed to read the related obituaries – it slows our productivity rate. Screeners are constantly monitored, instructed to work in the queues without clicking out of them for the duration of our shifts. Deprived of the grand picture, I would often find myself left with head-scratchers: is the author addressing a parent or spouse? Is this entry for a person or a pet?</p><p>When I wasn’t processing condolences, I would shuttle between more sobering assignments. For example, I reviewed names of the deceased, correcting any spelling errors in death notices. (I was still not permitted to read the obit itself.) I also verified and input service event details. Burials, funerals, interments, entombments, inurnments, committals. This type of somber yet menial data entry was suspiciously omitted from the original job description. Sure enough, half of each shift eventually consisted of it.</p><p>As I worked out of our apartment, my longtime partner often witnessed the frantic drudgery of death work – how it reduced me to a dazed-looking schmucko supremo dismissing her in shushes and hand waves. It was hard enough to screen human complexity while heating up dinner. It was even harder knowing every keyboard click was logged by faceless supervisors and scrutinized for inactivity gaps. While I call it “death work”, my partner saw my job closer to grief work. Except from her own detached position, she considered an unreflective content screener as the very worst kind of bereavement counselor: “Who, really, is the arbiter of what’s an appropriate way to express grief?”</p><hr><figure id="68590891-bed0-40e2-8d8f-4e2dd768bbda" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:13,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘Gloom is good’: after my wife died I found solace in poetry and music&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;68590891-bed0-40e2-8d8f-4e2dd768bbda&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/feb/04/gloom-is-good-after-my-wife-died-i-found-solace-in-poetry-and-music&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:4,&quot;design&quot;:10}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false}"></gu-island></figure><p>Early on, I reacted to this job by defiantly ditching my own filter whenever away from my remote desktop. After one shift, I remember walking to the home of a notable Chicago musician for a dinner party. It was a rarefied event among, let’s say, not-exactly-ordinary mortals. Once seated, each guest was asked what they had brought to the table. If ever there was a moment for content moderation in real life, this surely was it. But after hours of deleting or flagging entries I found authentically human, I lost all tact.</p><p>“I bring death,” I said flatly.</p><p>I’ve never been invited back.</p><p>Perhaps the most challenging part of my job was screening references to family fallouts and estrangement – the most common reason that entries are flagged or deleted. It turns out, I could handle tiny slices of other people’s messy and meandering loss. What was far more overwhelming was bowdlerizing it.</p><p>Full disclosure: I’m estranged from more than half of my relatives. I imagine this is why the queues’ seemingly eternal soapy family drama gnawed at me. Note after note, I was confronted with the grim realization that entries for my own small, fractured family would likely be deleted.</p><p>Running parallel, or perhaps underneath, all the disputes and estrangement is regret. The day always seems to be getting away from authors, preventing them from what’s urgently needed: rebuilding past relationships. “I thought we had more time” is a remorseless refrain.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-20">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-20" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Screening vast amounts of regretful messages typically jolted an eagerness to repair my own family rifts and neglected friendships. And then, inevitably, the day got away from me too.</p><hr><p><span>F</span>or a few years, directly after work, I would travel a dozen miles to a boxing class. I believed that the best way to reconcile myself to death work, and perhaps death itself, was to smash sledgehammers on to tires.</p><p>Week after week, I would inelegantly throw punches next to jacked, statuesque boxers, carefully stepping around fresh blood drizzled across the ring. Though I intended to keep my day job separate from boxing nights, I quickly opened up to a curious, tolerant community. On a few occasions, I even recall sparring while chatting about inappropriate condolence notes.</p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic upended my unexpected boxing stint. It also irrevocably transformed sympathy note screening. One might think a global pandemic would unify grievers. Nevertheless, authors noting Covid-19 devastation arrived in the queues alongside entries dismissing it as a “liberal hoax”.</p><p>There is, however, one observation about our turbulent times that I didn’t need to delete. An observation, I should add, with strong bipartisan support among disparate guestbook authors: entries written to those who had died years ago almost always emphasized that the deceased were lucky to be missing out on our current world.</p><p>Near the sixth anniversary of sympathy note screening, I asked my parents and partner if I seemed more sympathetic lately. Their response? Not at all. Instead, my mother was quick to note a harsher observation. “You’re more conscious of time, even when you don’t need to be,” she said. “You’re always on the clock now.”</p><p>I wonder: was I subconsciously “always on the clock” due to working in an industry built on those who have permanently clocked out? Or had arduously screening unending content against a stopwatch just to meet “productivity goals” scrambled my sense of time?</p><p>Whatever the case, death work didn’t lead me to a greater understanding of life. Mostly it just reinforced what I already worried about.</p><p>Still, reading half a million condolence notes convinced me of one thing: the empty “thoughts and prayers” language around grief might drastically improve if we communicated only in typos.</p><p>And so let me conclude my own flaggable entry with a sympathetic hope: during these difficult times, amid terrible trade gyms, always remember to keep hanging on to the find meteorites.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="content">
        <article>
            
            <div>
                
                <p>To implement its safety guarantees, the Rust compiler keeps careful track
of ownership and references throughout a program. This makes writing certain
kinds of data structures challenging; in particular, data structures that have
circular references.</p>
<p>Let's start with a simple binary tree:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>struct</span> <span>Tree</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>root</span>: <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Node</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Node</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>data</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>left</span>: <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Node</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>right</span>: <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Node</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Since the Rust compiler should be able to calculate the size of a struct at
compile-time, <tt>left</tt> and <tt>right</tt> typically use a heap-allocated <tt>Box</tt>.
These boxes are wrapped in an <tt>Option</tt> because a node's left or right child
might be empty.</p>
<p>Now suppose we want to add a <em>parent</em> link to every node. This is useful for
certain tree structures; for example, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree">binary search tree</a> (BST), a parent link can
be used to efficiently find the successor of a node. How can we do that?</p>
<div id="the-obvious-approach-fails">
<h2>The "obvious" approach fails</h2>
<p>We can't just add a <tt>parent: Option&lt;Box&lt;Node&gt;&gt;</tt> field to <tt>Node</tt>, because
that would imply that a node owns its parent; this is clearly wrong. In fact,
our original <tt>Node</tt> definition already makes it clear that a parent owns its
children, not the other way around.</p>
<p>So we probably want to add a <em>reference</em> instead; a parent owns its children,
but a child may <em>refert to</em> a parent. That sounds right; let's try it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>struct</span> <span>Node</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>data</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>left</span>: <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Node</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>right</span>: <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Node</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>parent</span>: <span>Option</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>Node</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Rust will refuse to compile this, asking for an explicit lifetime parameter.
When we store a reference in a struct field, Rust wants to know how the lifetime
of this reference relates to the lifetime of the struct itself. Fair enough, we
can do that:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>struct</span> <span>Tree</span><span>&lt;'</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>root</span>: <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Node</span><span>&lt;'</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Node</span><span>&lt;'</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>data</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>left</span>: <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Node</span><span>&lt;'</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>right</span>: <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Node</span><span>&lt;'</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>parent</span>: <span>Option</span><span>&lt;&amp;'</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>Node</span><span>&lt;'</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now the lifetime is explicit: we tell the compiler that the lifetime of the
<tt>parent</tt> reference is the same as the <tt>Node</tt> itself. This struct definition
will compile, but writing actual code manipulating it will very quickly get into
an altercation with the borrow checker. Consider the code that would insert a
new child node into the current node; to mutate the current node, a mutable
reference to it has to be in scope. At the same time, the new child's parent
link is a reference to the node. The borrow checker won't let us create a
reference to an object which already has a live mutable reference to it; it also
won't let us mutate an object while any other reference to it is alive.</p>
<p>As an exercise, try to write an insertion method for the tree using this
<tt>Node</tt> definition; you'll run into the problem fairly quickly.</p>
</div>
<div id="now-what">
<h2>Now what?</h2>
<p>Clearly, the "obvious" way doesn't work. And indeed, thinking about it from
first principles, it shouldn't. In this post I'm using BSTs with parent links as
a simple case study, but there are even more obvious (and perhaps more useful)
examples. Consider a graph data structure; a node has edges pointing to other
nodes, and two nodes can easily point to each other. Who owns whom? Since this
question cannot be answered at compile-time in the general case, it means we
can't just use plain Rust references for these "points to" relations. We need to
be somewhat more clever.</p>
<p>Having tackled this issue over and over again, Rust programmers
have settled on three potential solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Defer borrow checking to <em>run-time</em>, by using a
reference-counted pointer (<tt><span>std::rc::Rc</span></tt>) to a <tt><span>std::cell:RefCell</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Centralize the ownership (e.g. all nodes are owned by a vector of nodes
in the <tt>Tree</tt>), and then references become <em>handles</em> (indices into
the abovementioned vector).</li>
<li>Use raw pointers and <tt>unsafe</tt> blocks.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this post, I'll present each of these approaches, applied to implementing
a reasonably feature-complete BST with insertion, deletion, a "get successor"
method and inorder traversal. The full code for this post is available in
<a href="https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/tree/master/2021/rust-bst">this repository</a>; the post
only presents a few snippets of interest for each approach. Refer to the code
repository for the complete implementations with comments and extensive tests.</p>
</div>
<div id="run-time-borrow-checking-with-rc-and-refcell">
<h2>Run-time borrow checking with Rc and RefCell</h2>
<p>This approach uses a combination of two data structures from the Rust standard
library:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><tt><span>std::rc::Rc</span></tt> is a reference-counted pointer, providing shared ownership of
heap-allocated data. Multiple instances of <tt>Rc</tt> can refer to the same
data; when all references are gone, the heap allication is dropped <a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>. This
is quite similar to a <tt>shared_ptr</tt> in C++.</p>
<p><tt>Rc</tt> has a <em>weak dual</em>, <tt><span>std::rc::Weak</span></tt>; this represents a weak pointer
to data owned by some other <tt>Rc</tt>. While we can access the data through a
<tt>Weak</tt>, if only weak pointers remain the allocation will be dropped. In
C++ this would be a <tt>weak_ptr</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><tt><span>std::cell::RefCell</span></tt> is a mutable memory location with <em>dynamically</em>
checked borrow rules. <tt>RefCell</tt> allows us to take and pass around
references to heap data without the scrutiny of the borrow checker. However,
it's still safe; all the same borrow rules are enforced by <tt>RefCell</tt> at
run-time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the full code implementing this approach <a href="https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/blob/master/2021/rust-bst/src/rcrefcell.rs">here</a>.
In what follows, I'll highlight some interesting parts.</p>
<p>This is how can define our BST data structure <a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2">[2]</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>std</span>::<span>cell</span>::<span>RefCell</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>use</span><span> </span><span>std</span>::<span>rc</span>::<span>{</span><span>Rc</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Weak</span><span>};</span><span></span>

<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>struct</span> <span>Tree</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>count</span>: <span>usize</span><span>,</span><span></span>

<p>For simplicity, the code samples in this post separate the operation on the
root into a top level function/method, which then calls a recursive method
that operates at the node level. In this case, <tt>insert_at</tt> takes a link
and inserts the new data as the child of that node. It preserves the BST
invariant (smaller implies left child, larger implies right child). The
interesting thing to note here is the <tt>borrow_mut()</tt> call at the very
beginning. It obtains a mutable reference from the <tt>RefCell</tt> pointed to by
<tt>atnode</tt>. But this isn't just a regular Rust mutable reference, as in
<tt>&amp;mut</tt>; instead, it's a special type called <tt><span>std::cell::RefMut</span></tt>. This is
where the mutability magic happens - there is no <tt>&amp;mut</tt> in sight, yet the
code can actually mutate the underlying data <a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-reference-3">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>To reiterate, this code remains safe; if you attempt to do another
<tt>borrow_mut()</tt> on the <tt>RefCell</tt> while the previous <tt>RefMut</tt> is in scope,
you'll get a run-time panic. The safety is guaranteed at run-time.</p>
<p>Another interesting example is the private <tt>find_node</tt> method, which finds
and returns a node with the given data, starting from some node:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>/// Find the item in the tree; returns `true` iff the item is found.</span>

</pre></div>
<p>The <tt>.borrow()</tt> call at the beginning is how we ask a <tt>RefCell</tt> to provide
a immutable reference to the internal data (naturally, this cannot coexist at
run-time with any mutable references). When we return a node that was found, we
<tt>clone</tt> the <tt>Rc</tt>, because we need a separate shared owner for the node. This
lets Rust guarantee that the node cannot just be dropped while the returned
<tt>Rc</tt> is still alive.</p>
<p>As the full code sample demonstrates, this approach is workable. It takes a lot
of practice and patience to get right though, at least for inexperienced Rust
programmers. Since each node is wrapped in three levels of indirection
(<tt>Option</tt>, <tt>Rc</tt> and <tt>RefCell</tt>) writing the code can be somewhat tricky,
since at any point you have to remember which level of inderection you're
"currently in".</p>
<p>Another downside of this approach is that getting a plain reference to data
stored in the tree isn't easy. As you can see in the sample above, the top-level
<tt>find</tt> method doesn't return the node or its contents, but simply a boolean.
This isn't great; for example, it makes the <tt>successor</tt> method sub-optimal.
The problem here is that with <tt>RefCell</tt> we can't just return a regular <tt>&amp;</tt>
reference to the data, since the <tt>RefCell</tt> must keep a run-time track of all
the borrows. We can only return a <tt><span>std::cell::Ref</span></tt>, but this leaks
implementation details. This isn't a fatal flaw, but just something to keep in
mind while writing code using these types.</p>

<p>The second approach we're going to dicuss has the <tt>Tree</tt> owning all the nodes

<p>After writing code with <tt><span>Option&lt;Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;...&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></tt>, this handle approach feels
<em>very simple</em>. There are no layers of indirection; a handle is an index; a
reference to a node is a handle; handle 0 means "none", that's it <a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-reference-4">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>This version is also likely to be much more efficient than the linked version,
because it has far fewer heap allocations and the single vector is very cache
friendly.</p>
<p>That said, there are some issues here as well.</p>
<p>First, we take some of the safety into our own hands. While this approach won't
result in corrupted memory, double frees or accessing freed pointers, it
can lead to run-time panics and other problems because we deal in "raw" indices
to a vector. Due to bugs, these incides may point past the vector's bounds,
or point at the wrong slot, etc. For example, nothing prevents us from modifying
a slot while there are "live handles" to it.</p>
<p>The other issue is removing tree nodes. Right now, the code "removes" a node
simply by not pointing to it with any live handle. This makes the node
unreachable through the tree's methods, but it does not deallocate memory. In
fact, this BST implementation never deallocates anything:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// Replaces `node` with `r` in the tree, by setting `node`'s parent's</span>
<span>// left/right link to `node` with a link to `r`, and setting `r`'s parent</span>
<span>// link to `node`'s parent.</span>
<span>// Note that this code doesn't actually deallocate anything. It just</span>

<p>This is obviously wrong for real-world applications. At the very least, this
implementation can be improved by creating a "free list" of unused indices which
can be reused when nodes are added. A more ambitious approach could be to
implement a full-fledged garbage collector for the nodes. If you're up for a
challenge, give it a try ;-)</p>

<h2>Using raw pointers and unsafe blocks</h2>
<p>The third and final approach to discuss is using <em>raw pointers</em> and <tt>unsafe</tt>
blocks to implement our BST. This approach feels very familiar if you're coming
from a C / C++ background. The full code is <a href="https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/blob/master/2021/rust-bst/src/unsafeall.rs">here</a>.</p>

<p>Node links become <tt>*mut Node</tt>, which is a raw pointer to a mutable <tt>Node</tt>.
Working with raw pointers is quite similar to writing C code, with a few
idiosyncracies around allocating, deallocating and accsesing data through these
pointers. Let's start with allocation; here are the <tt>Node</tt> constructors:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>impl</span><span> </span><span>Node</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>

<p>The simplest way I found to allocate new memory for a raw pointer is using
<tt><span>Box::into_raw</span></tt>, and it works well as long as we remember that deallocating
this memory is on us from that point on (more on this later).</p>
<p>Let's see how insertion works:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>/// Insert a new item into the tree; returns `true` if the insertion</span>

<p>The interesting point to notice here is the <tt>unsafe</tt> block the body of
<tt>insert_node</tt> is wrapped in. This is required because this code dereferences
raw pointers. In Rust it's OK to assign pointers and pass them around
without special provisions, but dereferencing requires <tt>unsafe</tt>.</p>
<p>Let's see how removing nodes work; here's <tt>replace_node</tt>, which performs
the same task as the similarly named method we've seen in the node handle
approach:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// Replaces `node` with `r` in the tree, by setting `node`'s parent's</span>
<span>// left/right link to `node` with a link to `r`, and setting `r`'s parent</span>

<span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>This demonstrates how we deallocate heap data through raw pointers: by using
<tt><span>Box::from_raw</span></tt>. This makes a <tt>Box</tt> that takes ownership of the data; a
<tt>Box</tt> has a destructor, so it will actually deallocate it when it goes out
of scope.</p>
<p>This brings us to an important point: we have to take care of releasing the
memory of the <tt>Tree</tt> now. Unlike in the previous approaches, the default
<tt>Drop</tt> implementation won't do here, since the only thing contained in our
<tt>Tree</tt> is <tt>root: *mut Node</tt> and Rust has no idea how to "drop" that. If
we run our tests without implementing the <tt>Drop</tt> trait explicitly, there will
be memory leaks. Here's a simple implementation of <tt>Drop</tt> to fix that:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>impl</span><span> </span><span>Drop</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>Tree</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>self</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>// Probably not the most efficient way to destroy the whole tree, but</span>
<span>        </span><span>// it's simple and it works :)</span>
<span>        </span><span>while</span><span> </span><span>!</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>root</span><span>.</span><span>is_null</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>            </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>remove_node</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>root</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>As an exercise, try to implement a more efficient <tt>Drop</tt>!</p>
<p>Writing the code with raw pointers felt fairly natural; while the final LOC
count is similar, the raw pointers required significantly less mental burden
than using <tt><span>Option&lt;Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Node&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></tt> <a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-reference-5">[5]</a>. Though I didn't benchmark it,
my hunch would be that the pointer version is more efficient as well; at the
very least, it eschews the dynamic borrow checks that <tt>RefCell</tt> does. The
flip side is, of course, the loss of safety. With the <tt>unsafe</tt> version we
can run into all the good-old C memory bugs.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The goal of this post was to review the different approaches one could take to
implement non-trivial linked data structures in Rust. It covers approaches with
three levels of safety:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully safe with <tt>Rc</tt> and <tt>RefCell</tt>.</li>
<li>Memory safe but otherwise more prone to bugs (such as aliasing borrows)
with integer handles into a <tt>Vec</tt>.</li>
<li>Fully unsafe with raw pointers.</li>
</ul>
<p>All three approaches have their merits and are useful to know, IMHO. Anecdotal
evidence from Rust's own standard library and some popular crates suggests that
the third approach - using raw pointers and <tt>unsafe</tt> - is quite popular.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! Since this is my first non-trivial Rust post, I'm
