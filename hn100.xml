<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> <div id="markdown-content"> <p><em>tl;dr:</em></p> <ul> <li>Historically, general approaches always win in AI.</li> <li>Founders in AI application space now repeat the mistakes AI researchers made in the past.</li> <li>Better AI models will enable general purpose AI applications. At the same time, the added value of the software around the AI model will diminish.</li> </ul> <p>Recent AI progress has enabled new <code>products</code> that solve a broad range of <code>problems</code>. I saw this firsthand watching over 100 pitches during YC alumni Demo Day. These problems share a common thread - they’re simple enough to be solved with <code>constrained</code> AI. Yet the real power of AI lies in its <code>flexibility</code>. While <code>products</code> with fewer constraints generally work better, current AI <code>models</code> aren’t reliable enough to build such products at scale. We’ve been here before with AI, many times. Each time, the winning move has been the same. AI founders need to learn this history, or I fear they’ll discover these lessons the hard way.</p> <p>In 2019, Richard Sutton started his famous essay “The Bitter Lesson” with:</p> <p>“The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin”.</p> <p>He points out that throughout AI’s history, researchers have repeatedly tried to improve systems by building in human domain knowledge. The “bitter” part of the title comes from what happens next: systems that simply use more computing power end up outperforming these carefully crafted solutions. We’ve seen this pattern in speech recognition, computer chess, and computer vision. If Sutton wrote his essay today, he’d likely add generative AI to that list. And he warns us: this pattern isn’t finished playing out.</p> <p>“As a field, we still have not thoroughly learned it, as we are continuing to make the same kind of mistakes (…). We have to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run. The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation”</p> <p>From an AI research perspective, the Bitter Lesson deals with clear definitions of “better.” In computer chess, it’s your win rate; in speech recognition, it’s word accuracy. But this post looks at AI <code>products</code> in the application layer (see Figure 1), where “better” means both <code>performance</code> and <code>adoption</code> in the market. We’ll cover adoption in Chapter 2. For now, let’s focus on product performance - the amount of economically valuable work a product can replace. Better performance means handling more complex problems, which unlocks more value.</p> <p><img src="https://lukaspetersson.com/assets/img/stack.png" alt="stack"></p> <p><em>Figure 1, illustration of different types of AI products. In this post, we talk about the application layer.</em></p> <p>AI <code>products</code> are typically an AI <code>model</code> wrapped in some <code>packaging software</code>. You can improve their performance in two ways:</p> <ol> <li>Through engineering effort: using domain knowledge to build constraints into the packaging software</li> <li>Through better models: waiting for AI labs to release more capable models</li> </ol> <p>You can pursue both paths, but here’s the crucial insight: as models improve, the value of engineering effort diminishes. Right now, there are huge gains to be made in building better packaging software, but only because current models make many mistakes. As models become more reliable, this will change. Eventually, you’ll just need to connect a model to a computer to solve most problems - no complex engineering required.</p> <p><img src="https://lukaspetersson.com/assets/img/perf-vs-effort.png" alt="perf-vs-effort"></p> <p><em>Figure 2, illustration of the diminishing returns of engineering effort when building AI products in the application layer. The value diminishes both as more engineering effort is made and as better models are released.</em></p> <p>The graph above shows how engineering effort becomes less valuable as models improve. Current models have significant limitations, which means companies can still gain a lot from engineering work. I saw this at YC alumni Demo Day, where companies were finding success. The landscape splits into two groups: those with products in production at scale (solving simple problems) - a small group for now - and those targeting slightly more complex problems. This second group is doing well because their proof-of-concepts suggest their goals are achievable with enough engineering effort.</p> <p>But here’s the key question these companies face: will the next model release make all that engineering work obsolete, destroying their competitive advantage? The launch of OpenAI’s o1 model illustrates this risk. I spoke with many founders in the AI application layer who were worried because they’d invested heavily in perfecting prompts to boost performance. But with o1, prompt engineering matters less. As Figure 2 shows, o1 is smarter, but this means there’s less value in the engineering work these companies did.</p> <p>At its core, this engineering effort aims to constrain AI and reduce its mistakes. From observing many solutions, I’ve identified two main types of constraints:</p> <ul> <li> <code>Specificity</code>: This represents how focused a solution is. A <code>vertical</code> solution has packaging software built for one specific problem. A <code>horizontal</code> product, in contrast, can handle many different types of problems.</li> <li> <code>Autonomy</code>: This measures how independently the AI can operate. Following Anthropic’s terminology, we have <code>workflows</code> - systems where LLMs and tools follow predefined code paths - and <code>agents</code> - systems where LLMs control their own processes and tool usage, deciding how to complete tasks.</li> </ul> <p>These two types of constraints create a framework for categorizing AI products:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>&nbsp;</th> <th><strong>Vertical</strong></th> <th><strong>Horizontal</strong></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Workflow</strong></td> <td>Harvey</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Agent</strong></td> <td>Devin</td> <td>Claude computer-use</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><em>Table 1: Classification of famous AI products. Note that ChatGPT likely follows a predefined code path for each message, making it a workflow rather than an agent.</em></p> <p>Let’s explore how each category might be implemented for the same task: a business analyst creating investment pitch slides. Here’s one possible approach for each:</p> <ul> <li> <code>Vertical</code> <code>workflow</code>: A fixed sequence of steps: First, makes a RAG query on a company database, passes this to a small LLM for summarization, then to a more capable LLM that extracts key numbers and uses a calculator tool. The LLM checks if these numbers make sense before writing slide content. Finally, a slide generator creates the presentation. This exact sequence runs every time.</li> <li> <code>Vertical</code> <code>agent</code>: An LLM runs in a loop, using its output from one iteration as input for the next. It has access to the same tools as the workflow version but decides for itself when to use them. The loop continues until the agent determines the results meet its quality threshold.</li> <li> <code>Horizontal</code> <code>workflow</code>: ChatGPT and similar tools could assist with parts of the task, but can’t complete it end-to-end. They lack both the specialization and autonomy needed for the full job.</li> <li> <code>Horizontal</code> <code>agent</code>: Claude computer-use gets access to standard company software. The analyst provides instructions in natural language, and the agent operates the computer like a human would, adapting its approach as needed.</li> </ul> <p>Almost all products at Demo Day fell into the vertical workflow category. This makes sense - current models aren’t reliable enough for other approaches. As a result, even problems too complex for vertical workflows are being forced into this mold since it’s the only way to get close to acceptable performance with current model capabilities. While engineering can improve these solutions, there’s an upper limit to what it can achieve. For problems that are out of reach with current models, the better strategy would be to wait for more capable models that can handle them with minimal engineering. As Leopold Aschenbrenner argues in “Situational Awareness,” for many problems, the engineering work will take longer than the wait for better models:</p> <p>“It seems plausible that the schlep will take longer than the unhobbling, that is, by the time the drop-in remote worker is able to automate a large number of jobs, intermediate models won’t yet have been fully harnessed and integrated”</p> <p>This pattern should sound familiar. Let’s return to the Bitter Lesson. AI researchers repeatedly tried to engineer their way to “acceptable performance,” only to be overtaken by more general solutions that simply used more compute. The parallel to how today’s AI products are built is striking. And we can make this connection even clearer by examining how the Bitter Lesson applies to our two types of constraints:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Bitter Lesson Observation</th> <th>Autonomy</th> <th>Specificity</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents</td> <td>The developer experiments with an autonomous agent but finds it unreliable. Instead, they hardcode the execution steps to follow the workflow that they would go through themselves when solving the task.</td> <td>The developer starts building a general document analysis system but finds it unreliable. Instead, they constrain it to just analyze financial statements, hardcoding specific metrics and validation rules.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2) This always helps in the short term and is personally satisfying to the researcher</td> <td>The developer finds that this increases reliability.</td> <td>The developer finds that specialization improves accuracy since the model only needs to handle a narrow set of documents and metrics.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3) In the long run, it plateaus and even inhibits further progress</td> <td>The constrained workflow sometimes does not give the correct output when faced with novel situations that weren’t considered in the hardcoded steps.</td> <td>The specialized system can’t handle related tasks like analyzing merger documents or earnings calls, requiring separate specialized systems for each type of analysis.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4) Breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation</td> <td>New model releases enable reliable agents that can figure out the right approach dynamically, backtracking and correcting mistakes as needed.</td> <td>New model releases can understand any business document holistically, extracting relevant information regardless of format or type, making specialized systems unnecessary.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>For problems with unclear solution paths, products with more autonomy will achieve better performance. Similarly, when dealing with large, complex input spaces, less specific products will perform better.</p> <p>This is the first in a four-part series examining the role of startups in AI. We’ve observed a historical pattern: AI models that leverage domain knowledge consistently get overtaken by those that leverage compute. Today’s AI products show striking parallels to this pattern.</p> <p>Though I’ve tried to focus on observations rather than opinions in this first part, my view likely shows through. Building software to compensate for current model limitations seems like fighting a losing battle, especially given how rapidly models are advancing. As Jarred, partner at YC, noted in the Lightcone podcast: “that first wave of LLM apps [vertical workflows] mostly did get crushed by the next wave of GPTs.”</p> <p>Sam Altman has repeatedly advocated for building startups that make you excited for releases of better models, rather than scared of them. Many of the founders in the AI application layer I speak to are excited about model releases, but for the sake of their startup, I don’t think they should be. They might be missing the insight from Figure 2; better models might actually reduce your edge, not enhance it. Of course, this is from the point of view of product performance - building something that can solve harder problems more effectively. In the next part, we’ll explore a different dimension: market adoption. After all, having better performance doesn’t guarantee winning the market.</p> <h3 id="appendix-a-statistical-view-of-the-bitter-lesson"><strong>Appendix A: Statistical View of The Bitter Lesson</strong></h3> <p>There’s another way to understand the Bitter Lesson using basic statistics. When building models, you typically face a tradeoff. You can either make a model that’s very precise in how it approaches problems (high bias) or one that’s more flexible but less predictable (high variance). The Bitter Lesson suggests choosing the flexible approach.</p> <p>Why? Because with more compute power and data, you can make flexible models more reliable. It’s like having more practice shots in basketball - eventually, you’ll become consistent even with a less rigid shooting form. The reverse isn’t true - a overly rigid approach will always be limited by its built-in assumptions.</p> <p>This maps directly to our discussion of AI products. Vertical workflows and specific constraints are like adding rigid rules - they make the AI more reliable now but limit how good it can eventually become. In contrast, letting AI operate more freely might seem risky today, but it allows the AI to find better solutions as models improve. As we’ve seen throughout this essay, betting against flexibility has historically been a losing strategy.</p> <h3 id="appendix-b-end-to-end-vs-feature-engineering"><strong>Appendix B: End-to-end vs Feature Engineering</strong></h3> <p><img src="https://lukaspetersson.com/assets/img/e2e.png" alt="e2e"></p> <p><em>Figure 1: Comparison of traditional machine learning, which requires manual feature engineering, with deep learning’s end-to-end approach. The traditional approach needs humans to define what’s important in the data, while deep learning figures this out by itself.</em></p> <p>Traditional machine learning requires humans to decide what’s important in the data. You take raw input, like an image, and manually extract meaningful patterns or “features” - like counting specific shapes or measuring certain properties. Deep learning, in contrast, learns these patterns automatically.</p> <p><img src="https://lukaspetersson.com/assets/img/car-features.png" alt="car-features"></p> <p><em>Figure 2: Self-driving car visualization showing feature extraction in action. The system identifies and tracks specific objects like cars, pedestrians, and lane markings. This represents the traditional approach of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, defined pieces.</em></p> <p>Let’s use self-driving cars as an example. You could build it two ways:</p> <ol> <li>Feature engineering: Break down what the car sees into specific pieces - where are the other cars, where are the lanes, how fast is that pedestrian moving?</li> <li>End-to-end: Feed raw video directly into a neural network and let it figure out how to drive.</li> </ol> <p>The feature engineering approach feels safer and more controlled. That’s why it dominated early AI. But as George Hotz observed: “if anything about the history of AI has taught us anything, it’s that feature engineering approaches will always be replaced and loose to end-to-end.”</p> <p><img src="https://lukaspetersson.com/assets/img/sholto.png" alt="sholto"></p> <p><em>Figure 3: Tweet from Sholto Douglas</em></p> <p>This connects directly to our discussion of AI products. Building vertical-specific tools is like feature engineering - you’re deciding what information matters ahead of time. When you constrain a model’s autonomy, you’re doing the same thing. While this might work better today, history suggests betting on end-to-end approaches will win in the long run.</p> <p>Follow me on <a href="https://x.com/lukaspet" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">X</a> to stay updated.</p> </div> </article></div>]]></description>

<p><img src="https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/images/PhDKnowledge.008.jpg" width="440">

<p> My wife and I chose to start funding these graduate students after we learned
that <a href="http://overcomingmovementdisorder.blogspot.com//">our
son</a> has a rare, fatal genetic disorder.  </p>

It may be too late for my son, but it's not too late for other children.

One small dent in the circle of knowledge; one giant leap for my son.

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
            <h2 id="goodbye-clojure">Goodbye, Clojure</h2>
<p>After ~7 years, I was <em>done</em> with <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>. I was writing a some
<a href="https://github.com/djha-skin/degasolv">CLI</a>
<a href="https://github.com/djha-skin/zic">apps</a>, and I <em>hated</em> how long they took to
start up. The community at large seemed not to care about this problem, except
for the <a href="https://github.com/babashka/babashka">babashka</a> folks. However, I spent
long, hard hours banging my head against
<a href="https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/">native-image</a>
and it just wasn't working out. It was incredibly painful, and at the end of it,
I still didn't have standalone, fast-starting native executables. I decided that
that was a requirement for my main driving hobby language, and that Clojure didn't
have it. It was then that I decided to move on from Clojure.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-hunt-for-a-new-lisp">On the Hunt for a New Lisp</h2>
<p>I started shopping around for a new lisp to use after hours like I'd done before
with my home projects. I had specific requirements in mind, though I didn't
actually list them when I started. I can list them now in hindsight, though:</p>
<ol>
<li>It must be easy to create standalone, fast-starting executables using a
   reasonable toolchain (to address my main concern with Clojure)</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.djhaskin.com/blog/emacs-users-im-okay-i-promise/">I can't use
   Emacs</a>, so
   it's got to be usable in Vim.</li>
<li>It must have good support for Windows and Mac, in addition just Linux/POSIX
   operating systems.</li>
<li>It would be nice if it allows plugging into some other, large-community
   imperative language, like Clojure does with Java.</li>
<li>It must have a reasonably fast runtime -- hopefully as good or better as
   Clojure's.</li>
<li>The language must have a strong multithreading story. It would be grand if
   whatever language it was didn't have a
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock">GIL</a>, for example.</li>
<li>Must have a strong community.</li>
<li>Must have a good ecosystem, with at least the following libraries
   well-implemented, thus supporting my common use cases of making CLI tools:<ol>
<li>JSON parsing and serialization</li>
<li>Sqlite3 support</li>
<li>HTTP requests library </li>
<li>Would be nice if it had functional data structures like Clojure's (this
   ended up being less of an issue later)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I looked at <a href="https://www.scheme.org/">Scheme</a>, but that community seemed to
still be fractured over the
<a href="https://elmord.org/blog/?entry=20171001-r6rs-r7rs">r6rs</a>/<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/scheme-reports-wg2/c/xGd0_eeKmGI/m/q-xM5fbuAQAJ?pli=1">r7rs</a>
mess. Also, there wasn't <a href="https://akkuscm.org/packages/">a big enough ecosystem</a>
to suit my liking.</p>
<p>I'd already tried <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> in school and didn't like it. The runtime was a bit
slow and bloated for my tastes.</p>
<p>I had seen <a href="https://lisp-lang.org/">lisp-lang.org</a> shared on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28725958">the Orange
Site</a>. I was impressed with the
site. I came back to it later after I first saw it and thought, why not. Maybe
I'll give Common Lisp a shot.</p>
<h2 id="magic-happens-here">Magic Happens Here</h2>
<p>I will spare the reader the full narrative of my learning CL.
It was a rough ride learning the language. (I went about it the wrong way,
getting
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Common-LISP-Language-Second-Steele/dp/1555580416/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2W8Y093RT5UQN&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ZDcuOzchQwO4txmVOLrlDRGU3K0TMYMsM0OMVdMocZUW_Wj2K3YYFfB8bATRFvKaR-Vz-P1ai5hpSAzE1q6Ii1FwQK7zu1d8vn3qa88EQCipfnbJoYsHbiNQKbl8NJBhuhZu410r8KXjyJNjG_gvC7r9TX_PSp6VDNLcalMgo4g9xI7m52SnG1BOdFxZ44tmKdn97DKpv0Oqw9ngYg_dDm5_6MUuPan0hPrbrMKcp58.H5QKWhJtzda3Xl9dXb_siYXClmIBIseqGTy3IKAkN-0&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=common+lisp+the+language&amp;qid=1736648071&amp;sprefix=common+lisp+the+language+%2Caps%2C146&amp;sr=8-1">CLtLv2</a>
for Christmas and reading through that. I eventually found the
<a href="https://clhs.lisp.se/">HyperSpec</a> and started reading that as well.)</p>
<p>There were some weird things I didn't expect to find about CL. It's a
<em>standardized</em> language, more like C than Java that way. There are many
compilers, interpreters, and runtimes that implement that standard. There's even
<a href="https://github.com/roswell/roswell">a tool to help install them all and wrangle
them</a>. The most popular one <a href="https://blog.djhaskin.com/blog/common-lisp-community-survey-2024-results/">according to
the
community</a>
is <a href="https://www.sbcl.org/">SBCL</a>.</p>
<p>If I had heard about <a href="https://janet-lang.org/">Janet</a> when starting this hunt,
I might have stopped there and not gone on to CL. Nice syntax, small, fast
executables, <a href="https://janet-lang.org/docs/ffi.html">C FFI</a>, <a href="https://janet.guide/">a fun intro
book</a>. It checks all my boxes.</p>
<p>However, I'm glad I did learn CL first, because I think I'd miss the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System">CLOS</a> and the
Conditions System, things I learned about later in my journey. Common Lisp is
just a bit of a stronger language.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-met">Requirements Met</h2>
<p>I found answers to all my questions, and decided my next lisp was going to be
Common Lisp. I've been coding in it ever since. Here are the things I found:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Standalone Executables</strong>: there are lots of ways to do this in Common Lisp. I
   summarize my favorite way in <a href="https://blog.djhaskin.com/blog/release-common-lisp-on-your-first-day/">another blog
   post</a>.
   Start up times range from a fraction of a second to nearly instant, depending
   on if you compile the executable with compression or not. This is not a
   bolt-on feature; it's a first-class-citizen way to distribute Lisp programs.</li>
<li><strong>Vim Workflow</strong>: There are a lot of good ones here, but I eventually settled
   into <a href="https://blog.djhaskin.com/blog/developing-common-lisp-using-vim-with-tmux-or-conemu/">a Vim workflow of my
   own</a>.
   Readers may also be interested to know that <a href="https://blog.djhaskin.com/blog/experience-report-using-vs-code-alive-to-write-common-lisp/">I found VS Code perfectly
   usable</a>
   as a Common Lisp IDE.</li>
<li><strong>Windows/Mac/Linux Support</strong>: SBCL, a popular implementation and compiler for
   Common Lisp, supports The Big Three relatively well, as outlined in the
   blog post linked in point #1.</li>
<li><strong>Larger Imperative Ecosystem</strong>: Most implementations actually hook into the C
   programming language pretty well through the
   <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cffi">CFFI</a>. That works for me.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime Speed</strong>: SBCL is <a href="https://github.com/niklas-heer/speed-comparison">crazy
   fast</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Multithreading</strong>: While the Common Lisp standard does not make provisions
   for multithreading, all major implementations do support it and their
   differences are papered over with a library called
   <a href="https://sionescu.github.io/bordeaux-threads/">Bordeaux-Threads</a>. This
   library serves as an underpinning for the
   <a href="https://github.com/lmj/lparallel">lparallel</a> library, an excellent library
   for multithreading. There's also <a href="https://orthecreedence.github.io/cl-async/">cl-async</a> and <a href="https://orthecreedence.github.io/blackbird/">blackbird</a> for
   asynchronous programming and promises, respectively.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Community</strong>: I discovered the community as I did the rest of the
   language -- in fits and starts. A good summary of the community (as it was in
   2024) is summarized in the <a href="https://blog.djhaskin.com/blog/common-lisp-community-survey-2024-results/">Common Lisp Community Survey
         2024</a>.
         CL features prominently at the <a href="https://www.european-lisp-symposium.org/">European Lisp
         Symposium</a>. CL has a strong
         <a href="https://planet.lisp.org/">blogosphere</a> and
         <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Common_Lisp/">subreddit</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Ecosystem</strong>: The ecosystem is pretty great. Most folks use
   <a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/">Quicklisp</a>, though I use
   <a href="https://github.com/ocicl/ocicl/releases">OCICL</a> for package management. The
   <a href="https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/">Common Lisp Cookbook</a>, the
   <a href="https://www.cliki.net/">CLiki</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl">Awesome
   CL</a> provide
   nice survey of available libraries and techniques. Here
   are some answers to those particular libary queries I had:<ol>
<li><strong>JSON</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/Zulu-Inuoe/jzon">jzon</a></li>
<li><strong>Sqlite3</strong>: <a href="https://cl-sqlite.common-lisp.dev/">cl-sqlite</a></li>
<li><strong>HTTP requests</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/fukamachi/dexador">dexador</a></li>
<li><strong>Functional Datastructures</strong>: <a href="https://fset.common-lisp.dev/">FSet</a>, <a href="https://github.com/danshapero/cl-hamt">cl-hamt</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="new-friends-take-note">New Friends Take Note</h2>
<p>I wrote this blog post because I noticed that there have been more newcomers on
the <a href="https://discord.gg/HsxkkvQ">Common Lisp Discord</a> and they've been asking the same questions I was
when I was first looking at the language. I wanted to lay down a bit of history
around why I came to Common Lisp, and how I acclimated to the language. I hope
it may be helpful to those new to or curious about Common Lisp.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/about-us/events-conferences/health-care-conference">J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference</a>, starting Monday in San Francisco, 8,000 insurance providers, pharma investors, and execs from Open AI, Amazon, and Meta will announce mergers, discuss advances in AI diagnostics and gene therapies, and puzzle over&nbsp;FDA scrutiny and compliance issues. But many of the sessions and “what’s next” debates will follow the Chatham House Rule — a gag order that prevents attendees from attributing information to speakers or sharing names or affiliations of other guests.</p><p>“The rule makes it terrible for networking,” said Malcolm Ocean, a Bay Area “<a href="https://malcolmocean.com/">renegade anthropologist</a>” who will not attend the conference. “In principle, it prohibits you from saying to your team, hey, I talked to this guy, and he’s working on this startup.”</p><p>But the Chatham House Rule (it’s singular but is often misused in the plural) has caught fire in the business world, especially within the secrecy-obsessed tech industry, and now become ubiquitous at events across the Bay Area. At an <a href="https://app.glueup.com/en/event/responsible-adoption-of-general-purpose-ai-108941/">AI summit</a> in Redwood City, an intimate dinner party in Los Altos Hills, <a href="https://lu.ma/brexupfront">Brex Supper Club salons</a>, Facebook’s <a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2019/what-worked-and-what-didnt-from-facebooks-local-news-summit/">local news summit</a>, Scale AI’s<a href="https://www.scale.com/legal/ai-leadership-summit"> leadership summit</a>, and the <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/AM13/WEF_AM13_CodeofConduct.pdf">World Economic Forum at Davos</a>, the rules of the house are increasingly Chatham.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also become prevalent, somewhat contentiously, on college campuses and has even crept into pop culture, via Netflix’s “The Diplomat,” a political thriller that dropped a reference to the Chatham House Rule in its heavily watched first season. Google Trends backs this up, indicating a 1,550% spike in searches for “Chatham house rules” as of Jan 7.</p><p>“I find that basically my whole life is Chatham House rules,” <a href="https://x.com/lessin/status/1844156064805392617">Sam Lessin</a>, a general partner at Slow Ventures, tweeted in November.&nbsp;</p><p>For the uninitiated, the Chatham House Rule dates to 1927, when the Royal Institute of International Affairs, a policy institute located at Chatham House in London, introduced the policy to foster free speech among analysts. It gained traction in the turbulent pre- and postwar period among academics, who appreciated the candor it allowed them.</p><p>Ocean’s first brush with the rule came in 2018, at a weekend “ideas” conference. His welcome email contained a throwaway line about the rule, in addition to the wifi password and information on where to check in, “so you can reasonably assume that most people didn’t read it.” That’s a problem, he said: If there isn’t common knowledge about the existence of the Chatham House Rule, “it diminishes the effect of confidentiality.”</p><p>He has since become frustrated by the term’s overuse, noting that it has popped up even at dinner parties and small coffee meetups. “There’s no clear reason why we’re using it,” he said. “I haven’t noticed people saying spicier stuff.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.askalinguist.org/">Jenny Lederer</a>, a linguistics professor at San Francisco State University, argued that the Chatham House Rule has intrinsic flaws. “The rule dissociates ideas and opinions from the speaker, allowing them to express something controversial without taking personal ownership,” she explained. But that’s a fallacy, because “when humans process language, they always pay attention to who the speaker is.”</p><p>Jeremy Nixon, the 31-year-old founder of <a href="https://agihouse.ai/">AGI House</a>, an AI-themed co-living house in San Francisco, believes there’s value to the rule if it’s properly implemented. He has run events that delve into taboo topics — the experience of living with bipolar disorder or psychosis, for example —&nbsp; and said people wouldn’t have shared without the gag rule being in place. “That was not a conversation that could leave the room because of the reputational consequences to the person revealing it,” he said. “If you can have a conversation that’s impossible anywhere else, it feels really freeing and special.”</p><p>But Nixon no longer applies the rule at his events. “It became treated just as something you should do,” he said. “It doesn’t work nearly as well if not taken seriously.” Instead, his groups have moved to signing NDAs or explicitly stating that conversations are not to be shared externally.</p><p>But the rule continues to proliferate in the Bay Area. In December, the Foresight Institute, a nonprofit that has received support from the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fund for Strategic Innovation and investor Mitch Kapor, hosted a $1,000-a-head Vision Weekend. It kicked off with a VIP bash at <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/10/23/salesforce-tower-secret-institute/">The Institute</a>, a secret club atop Salesforce Tower, then continued on to the Internet Archive, where 250 techies and researchers dived into panels on AI, machine consciousness, and “longevity cities.” The Chatham House Rule was in effect for the majority of events.&nbsp;</p><p>“The rule lends a sense of authority, credibility, and institutional sanction,” said SFSU’s Lederer. “The motivation is liberating ideas but removing accountability for those ideas is a shield for expressing controversial or unsavory ideas.”</p><p>But what one person sees as unsavory another calls long-overdue freedom of speech. A <a href="https://www.thefire.org/news/fire-survey-only-20-university-faculty-say-conservative-would-fit-well-their-department">December survey</a> found that 87% of U.S. college faculty struggled with hot-button topics; hence, the <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/us-universities-mull-adoption-chatham-house-rule-classes">spread of the Chatham House Rule on campuses</a>. Last year, Stanford University floated the rule as a policy to protect students from harassment, with <a href="https://freespeech.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/privacy/chatham-house-rule">violators facing penalties</a> like lower grades.</p><p>This can be dangerous, said Lederer, as removing identity from speech “can potentially remove our own sense of morality.”</p><p>But as we enter a new political era, and political and cultural divisions deepen, the rule’s popularity shows no signs of fading. “In corporate culture, there’s a liberating and freeing quality to the idea that this is a safe space for me to say unpopular things and not get labeled as a conservative or racist,” Lederer said.&nbsp;</p><p>Or, as Ocean put it, “maybe it’s just a bad solution to a worse problem.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h3>Press Release</h3>


<p>10 January 2025</p>




<p>On December 24th, AES Andes, a subsidiary of the US power company AES Corporation, submitted a project for a massive industrial complex for environmental impact assessment. This complex threatens the pristine skies above ESO’s Paranal Observatory in Chile’s Atacama Desert, the darkest and clearest of any astronomical observatory in the world <a href="#1">[1]</a>. The industrial megaproject is planned to be located just 5 to 11 kilometres from telescopes at Paranal, which would cause irreparable damage to astronomical observations, in particular due to light pollution emitted throughout the project’s operational life. Relocating the complex would save one of Earth's last truly pristine dark skies.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">An irreplaceable heritage for humanity&nbsp;</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Since its inauguration in 1999, Paranal Observatory, built and operated by the European Southern Observatory (ESO), has led to significant astronomy breakthroughs, such as the first image of an exoplanet and confirming the accelerated expansion of the Universe. The Nobel Prize in Physics in 2020 was awarded for research on the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, in which Paranal telescopes were instrumental. The observatory is a key asset for astronomers worldwide, including those in Chile, which has seen its astronomical community grow substantially in the last decades. Additionally, the nearby Cerro Armazones hosts the construction of ESO’s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), the world’s biggest telescope of its kind — a revolutionary facility that will dramatically change what we know about our Universe.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“The proximity of the AES Andes industrial megaproject to Paranal poses a critical risk to the most pristine night skies on the planet,”</em> highlighted ESO Director General, Xavier Barcons. <em>“Dust emissions during construction, increased atmospheric turbulence, and especially light pollution will irreparably impact the capabilities for astronomical observation, which have thus far attracted multi-billion-Euro investments by the governments of the ESO Member States.”</em></p>
<h4 dir="ltr">The unprecedented impact of a megaproject&nbsp;</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The project encompasses an industrial complex of more than 3000 hectares, which is close to the size of a city, or district, such as Valparaiso, Chile or Garching near Munich, Germany. It includes constructing a port, ammonia and hydrogen production plants and thousands of electricity generation units near Paranal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thanks to its atmospheric stability and lack of light pollution, the Atacama Desert is a unique natural laboratory for astronomical research. These attributes are essential for scientific projects that aim to address fundamental questions, such as the origin and evolution of the Universe or the quest for life and the habitability of other planets.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">A call to protect the Chilean skies&nbsp;</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“Chile, and in particular Paranal, is a truly special place for astronomy —&nbsp;its dark skies are a natural heritage that transcends its borders and benefits all humanity,”</em> said Itziar de Gregorio, ESO’s Representative in Chile.<em> “It is crucial to consider alternative locations for this megaproject that do not endanger one of the world's most important astronomical treasures.”</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">The relocation of this project remains the only effective way to prevent irreversible damage to Paranal's unique skies. This measure will not only safeguard the future of astronomy but also preserve one of the last truly pristine dark skies on Earth.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3><p dir="ltr"><a name="1"></a>[1] A <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/519/1/26/6936422">study</a> by Falchi and collaborators, published in 2023 in <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>, compared light pollution at all 28 major astronomical observatories, finding Paranal to be the darkest site among them.</p>

<p><strong>This is the story of a commercially unavailable <em>stereo pair</em> of the
bi-amped Marshall Uxbridge, with custom-built replacement electronics:
active filters feeding two linear power amps. Listening to this
high-fidelity set has brought me immense enjoyment. Play a great album
on these near-fields, and the result is close to pure magic! Over and
above the accurate reproduction of a wide audio range, the precision
and depth of its stereo imaging is stunning.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/muxbridge-pair.jpg"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/muxbridge-pair-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>Odd socks, rock’n’roll! (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>Dumpster diving electronics is a way of life, which sometimes brings
great moments of joy.  One of these moments happened when I stumbled
upon… the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=marshall+uxbridge&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">Marshall Uxbridge
Voice</a>,
a smart speaker, in seemingly pristine condition. And not just one,
but <em>two</em> of them! One was black, the other white. What a find!</p>

<p>What to do with these babies? Intrigued by the question “what could be
wrong with them, why would someone throw them out like that?” –
I set out to investigate. Plugging in one of them, after a few seconds
of waiting, a female voice was heard: <em>«NOW IN SETUP MODE. FOLLOW THE
INSTRUCTIONS IN YOUR DEVICE’S COMPANION APP.»</em></p>

<p>Sounded like a command: clear, loud and demanding. But no, that won’t
happen. Instead, let’s see if we can use this gadget as a plain old
Bluetooth speaker?  Yes indeed! With the help of <code>blueman-manager</code>, I
was able to hook it up to my Linux desktop (running Debian stable, as
ever) and select it as a speaker output. And it worked, and music
filled the room!</p>

<p>I was delighted, and immediately impressed by the sound quality. The
low end was punchy and deep, much deeper than the modest dimensions
led me to believe. The high end was crisp and detailed. Good drivers,
I thought, and a good amp – there’s got to be some iron and
copper inside, no wonder the thing is quite heavy! I liked it even
though the sound reminded me of the “disco smile” (hollowed out mids),
but I chalked that up to overly consumer-friendly default EQ
settings. Maybe it can be improved.</p>

<p>The other device was similarly well functioning. I still could not
believe my luck. Why would anyone throw out these excellent
Bluetooth-enabled, powered speakers? They are doing such a great job!</p>

<p>Being in the market for a couple high-end speakers, I started to
fantasize about making a stereo pair out of these two.  Is that even
possible? Probably not out of the box, as I could only
Bluetooth-connect one at a time with the computer.  While listening to
a video, I also learned that the speaker added some 300ms of delay
(compared to my wired headphones), which could be compensated, but was
going to be a pain nevertheless. I had no idea if it came from the
Bluetooth link or further processing in the “smart” speaker.  Probably
both. And any small differences between the latencies of two devices
would certainly destroy the stereo imaging, if I ever got that to
work…</p>

<p>Then the bland female voice suddenly came in over the music again,
loud and clear: <em>«CONNECTION UNSUCCESSFUL. CHECK YOUR APP FOR
INSTRUCTIONS AND TRY AGAIN.»</em> Oh my poor ears! And there goes my
listening experience!  <em>Don’t you dare open your filthy mouth again!</em></p>

<p>At that moment I knew I was not into <em>smart speakers</em>. Or at least not
into the smartness. The speakers were good. Oh, they were excellent!
But they had to be <em>de-smarted</em>. Preferably with a single, dumb,
analog RCA line input on their backs, so nobody but me gets to decide
over the program material. That way I could also drive them as a
stereo pair. No Bluetooth, no latency, no female robot overlord, just
a good old-fashioned line input!</p>

<p>Seems like a modest ask. Can we have it? Well, time to look inside!</p>

<h2 id="inside-the-uxbridge">Inside the Uxbridge</h2>

<p>Opening the enclosure by removing the backplate is a matter of pulling
the six ordinary Phillips screws on the back. Then, the box can be
pried open with some thin lever (screwdriver edge) – it fits
snugly and is made even tighter with some air-tight foam.</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/original-innards.jpg"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/original-innards-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>Original innards (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>The main electronics is on a board fastened to the back; it receives
power from a separate PSU hidden under the woofer via the big JST plug
(disconnected in the photo); the two smaller (connected) JST plugs
connect to the woofer and tweeter (red and white, respectively). There
are a couple flexible flat cables connecting to auxiliary boards
hosting the volume and tone controls (plus the mics and push-buttons)
on the top, and four RGB LEDs at the bottom of the front plate. I had
to disconnect some of these, as well as the JST power plug, so as to
take the above photo.</p>

<p>The main board comes with a smaller daughter board with <em>Linkplay</em>
written on it. This is supposedly an <a href="https://w.dspconcepts.com/reference-designs/amlogic-a113x-smart-speaker">OEM
module</a>
for wireless connectivity and the “smarts” of the speaker: it contains
an Amlogic A113X SoC, memory chips plus wireless module. The daughter
board slides into an edge connector (not entirely unlike PCIe) on the
main board. From the radio module, wires run off to two rectangular
patch antennas fastened near opposite upper corners of the backplane.
All wiring is covered in foam, and apparent care has been taken to
make the enclosure air-tight.</p>

<p>The audio amplifier itself is built around an ESMT AD85050. This
48-pin device is apparently a knock-off of <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/TAS5727">some class D power
amplifiers</a>, with rather <a href="http://www.micro-bridge.com/data/ESMT/AD85050.pdf">scarce
documentation</a> of
its own. It is employed in a two channel configuration, with separate
power amplifiers dedicated to both drivers. These, both the tweeter
and the woofer, measure close to 4Ω.</p>

<p>Looking at the circuit boards in some detail (and using a connectivity
checker), it becomes apparent that the I<sup>2</sup>C control, the
I<sup>2</sup>S two-channel digital audio stream and the 3.3V power all
come from the daughter board. Which, unfortunately, is also the source
of that vexing female robot commander voice.</p>

<p>Can we use the electronics? That depends on whether we are able to
oust the resident voice of terror, and get hold of an analog input.
Initially, I was hopeful, and felt that discarding everything between
the PSU and the speakers, including a ready-made power amp already
coupled to the speakers, would be a waste. As a first experiment, I
removed the daughter board.  Nothing worked – but in light of my
earlier findings, I was not surprised. So then, assuming I cut the
I<sup>2</sup>S lines to mute the damn robot, would it be possible to
somehow inject an analog input to the (otherwise digital) amp?</p>

<p>With an “I’m feeling lucky” attitude, I somehow managed to solder some
very thin wires connecting to the ESMT chip’s LINP, LINN and AGND
lines in the hope of finding out. In case you were wondering, these
are supposed to act as analog differential inputs for the power
amplifier’s “left” channel (non-inverting and inverting, plus analog
ground). As a first step, I tried asymetrically driving LINP (with
LINN tied to ground). Nothing came out of the speaker; evidently,
there is ample built-in fault-protection and shutdown mechanisms built
into the ESMT chip to combat such abuse.</p>

<p>Next, using an op-amp on a breadboard, I attached a very temporary
symmetrical driving circuit on the inputs. This did the trick of
making sound come out, and it did sound pretty good (no obvious noise,
distortion or interference), except that only the woofer was driven.
Ah, of course! The tweeter is wired to the other (“right”) channel! So
I would need to supply <em>two</em> symmetrical audio inputs to drive this
amp.  These would preferably be driven by an active loudspeaker filter
circuit that limits the frequency range for each driver.</p>

<p>Considering the need for so many “patch” wires and the prospect of
stuffing additional electronics into an already cramped box, this
route seemed less than optimal. I also briefly played with the thought
of keeping the digital-input amplifier; capturing the configuration
sent to it via I<sup>2</sup>C and duplicating that from some
microcontroller; then coming up with some way to drive the
I<sup>2</sup>S digital audio input… somehow. Replace the daughter
board? But too many unknowns remained, and I felt constrained by
choices already made by others.</p>

<h2 id="going-all-in">Going all-in</h2>

<p>At the same time, the initially dismissed prospect of completely
replacing the electronics started to look attractive. If I need to
build a bunch of active filter circuits to separate the frequency
bands <em>before</em> the power amps, sure I can add two power amps to that
lot… and throw out the existing board! Which is not especially
small, so there is plenty of real estate for its replacement.</p>

<p>And on the plus side, I could get rid of the idle power consumption of
a full-blown embedded computer system (complete with Bluetooth/WiFi
radio, so less EM pollution and potential interference), and less
dissipated heat (I could sense the closed back of the idling Uxbridge
get warm after half an hour or so). What’s not to like?</p>

<p>So let’s establish some requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The PSU supplies 18V DC. The whole system needs to be single-supply.</li>
  <li>Analog RCA line input on the back. Air-tight construction.</li>
  <li>Active pre-amp filter with the customary crossover of about
2&nbsp;kHz.</li>
  <li>Possibly some further audio equalization / speaker compensation.</li>
  <li>Two power amplifiers, one for the woofer and one for the tweeter.</li>
  <li>Output impedance (both amps): 4Ω.</li>
  <li>Non-obvious thermal constraints: dissipation in a hermetically
sealed box…?</li>
  <li>Obvious mechanical constraints (board size and JST connectors).</li>
</ul>

<p>The first step in the circuit design (with the constraints on DC power
input and speaker impedance set in place) was to find a suitable power
amplifier architecture with actual, existing components. After very
little searching, I settled on the
<a href="https://git.hq.sig7.se/muxbridge-biamp.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/doc/contrib/LM1875.pdf">LM1875T</a>
which seemed like a safe bet and promised high-end audio quality.  The
datasheet even has a reference circuit for single-supply operation.</p>

<p>Next, I decided on the crossover filters. Again, after a little
reading up on this subject, I found no reason to search beyond the
ubiquitous 4-th order
<a href="https://linkwitzlab.com/filters.htm">Linkwitz-Riley</a> filter
architecture (two cascaded, identical Sallen-Key low-pass or high-pass
filters to provide a steepness of 24&nbsp;dB/octave) with the
theoretical advantage of the channels neatly summing to 0&nbsp;dB (in
phase) throughout the crossover range.</p>

<p>What op-amp to use? I picked the
<a href="https://git.hq.sig7.se/muxbridge-biamp.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/doc/contrib/LM833.pdf">LM833</a>,
not too expensive but quite capable with its 15&nbsp;MHz
gain-bandwidth, 7&nbsp;V/μs slew rate and 4.5&nbsp;nV/√Hz
voltage noise. This is certainly a low noise, high speed op-amp when
targeting the audio range, and as it is a dual op-amp, we can build a
complete Linkwitz-Riley high-pass or low-pass filter out of a single
piece.</p>

<h2 id="the-complete-circuit">The complete circuit</h2>

<p>At this point, there is nothing left to do but <a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/rest.jpg">draw the rest of the
fucking owl</a>, so that is exactly
what I did. The complete schematic is available as a
<a href="https://git.hq.sig7.se/muxbridge-biamp.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/doc/schematic.pdf">PDF</a>;
below I will highlight the functional blocks one by one.</p>

<p>At all times, keep in mind that we are building an analog circuit with
op-amps, customarily fed with symmetrical supplies (with ground in the
middle). Due to the existing power supply, we need to make the whole
thing run from a single supply with respect to ground, and that is not
how these circuits are usually drawn. It’s a technical detail, but an
important one!</p>

<p>For this exact reason, let’s start with the virtual grounds for
supporting single supply operation:</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/schematic-vgnd.png"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/schematic-vgnd-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>Virtual ground circuitry (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>We could be more fancy and use an active device (a dedicated
“rail-splitter” like the
<a href="https://www.ti.com/product/TLE2426">TLE2426</a>, or just a regular
op-amp) to lower the source impedances driving these grounds, but in
practice, given the tiny loads, a well bypassed, moderate impedance
source will do just fine. With a non-obvious CAVEAT: For preserving
adequate separation between the woofer and tweeter signal paths (or,
rather, preventing cross-talk via the virtual ground), we use two
separate virtual grounds, each dedicated to one signal path.</p>

<p>The single power rail VCC itself comes directly from the PSU connector
J1; it supplies the three op-amps, each decoupled with a 100&nbsp;nF
poly capacitor:</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/schematic-power.png"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/schematic-power-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>Power input; op-amp supply &amp; decoupling (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>These are sort of trivial details, and are customarily omitted when
presenting analog circuits. It is important not to forget about
them. With these out of the way, let’s look at the meatier parts of
the circuit.</p>

<h2 id="active-filters">Active filters</h2>

<p>The incoming signal is AC-coupled into the circuit via C1, after which
R1 and R2 set the DC level to mid-supply (our virtual ground) for the
signal to ride from there on. C2, together with R3 and the source
impedance driving the line input, forms a first-order low-pass filter
(f<sub>c</sub>&nbsp;≈&nbsp;50&nbsp;kHz assuming a source
impedance of 600&nbsp;Ω) to eliminate any RF interference just
before the signal reaches the input follower U1A, which drives the
rest of the filter circuits with low impedance.</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/schematic-filters.png"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/schematic-filters-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>Input buffer &amp; active filter schematics (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>From here, the signal feeds two downstream signal paths. The upper
one, built around U2B and U2A, consists of two cascaded Sallen-Key
high-pass filters forming a 4-th order Linkwitz-Riley high-pass with
24&nbsp;dB/octave steepness below its corner frequency. The passive
component values are optimized to allow realisation with uniform
values of commonly available high-quality polymer capacitors, and
relatively small-value resistors in order to keep thermal noise
contributions as low as feasible. This path ends in the signal TWR_IN,
driving the tweeter’s power amplifier.</p>

<p>The lower signal path begins with a low-shelving filter around U1B,
augmented with the divider-degenerating capacitor C7 to roll off DC
response to unity. The purpose of this shelving filter is to provide
emphasis towards the woofer’s lower end, in order to compensate its
inevitable rolloff. The component values are the result of simulation
and real-world tuning (as described below).</p>

<p>The bass-enhanced signal then goes through a Linkwitz-Riley low-pass
filter (around U3A and U3B), a close counterpart to the tweeter HPF.
Component values were guided by the same optimization criteria. The
LPF comes last so as to attenuate the noise of preceding stages. The
resulting signal WFR_IN drives the woofer’s power amplifier.</p>

<p>Note the nodes labeled VGNDT on R5 and R7: these are tied to a virtual
ground dedicated to tweeter-side circuitry, set at half-supply.  This
ensures correct single-supply operation of U2B and U2A, as well as
correct DC level on TWR_IN. In the woofer path, the equivalent circuit
points can be tied to the real ground, as the DC level on the “cold”
side of the capacitors C10 and C12 has no influence on the filter’s
operation. The DC level on WFR_IN is determined by the R1/R2 divider
right at the input; the whole signal path up to WFR_IN is DC-coupled
(with a DC transfer of unity) from there.</p>

<h3 id="spice-simulation">SPICE simulation</h3>

<p>To validate the above circuit, I first built a simulation model in the
excellent <a href="https://xschem.sourceforge.io/index.html">XSchem</a>, and
asked <a href="https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/">ngspice</a> to compute the
frequency and phase response on both outputs.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/spice-ac.png" alt=""><br>
<em>AC simulation: magnitude and phase response of filter outputs</em></p>

<p>The (electrical) crossover frequency is 2&nbsp;kHz, with some slight
bump in the summed output (as evidenced by each channel being a bit
over -6&nbsp;dB). The <em>real</em> (acoustical) response will, however, also
be affected by driver response. According to listening tests, the
woofer’s high-frequency roll-off roughly compensates the “electrical”
bump in the crossover area.</p>

<p>What about the phase difference between the woofer and tweeter signal
paths? According to SPICE, at the crossover frequency the tweeter
output phase lags the woofer output by ~19°. That is equivalent to a
delay of 19/360 times one cycle duration at 2&nbsp;kHz, which works
out to around 26&nbsp;μs. Factoring in the speed of sound
(340&nbsp;m/s), this (electronic) delay is equivalent to an acoustic
propagation path difference of about 9&nbsp;mm.</p>

<p>In other words, the difference in signal propagation across the two
filters is equivalent to the tweeter being 9&nbsp;mm farther away from
the listener than the woofer. In reality, the tweeter is going to be a
bit closer to the listener, because the speakers will land on a table
below head height, and the tweeter is mounted higher up in the
enclosure. The exact geometry can vary quite a bit, but the geometric
path difference will be in the ballpark – <em>but with opposite
sign!</em></p>

<p>As a consequence, the filter delay does not pose a problem; on the
contrary, it might actually help the drivers’ sound waves arrive
perfectly in-phase around the crossover frequency. Given the inexact
nature of this problem (unknown variations in driver characteristics,
plus the uncontrolled acoustic environment), we won’t bother with a
delay compensator (allpass filter). It’s bound to be close to
“perfect” anyway.</p>

<h2 id="power-amplifiers">Power amplifiers</h2>

<p>The power amps for the tweeter and woofer are principally identical,
themselves closely following the single supply reference circuit in
the
<a href="https://git.hq.sig7.se/muxbridge-biamp.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/doc/contrib/LM1875.pdf">LM1875T</a>
datasheet. The voltage gain is set to 10 (via R16/R15 and R20/R19),
the lowest gain with guaranteed stability. A higher gain is not
desired, because the line input would then become overly sensitive
(its useful range, given the practical limitations on output volume,
would be too low).</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/schematic-power-amp.png"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/schematic-power-amp-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>Power amplifier schematics (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>Between the amps, only capacitors differ in two positions. In both
cases, we exploit the fact that the tweeter amp, given its useful
frequency range, can get away with higher corner frequencies. The
feedback loop degeneration caps C15 and C20 roll off the gain to unity
at DC; here, C15 can be made significantly smaller than its
counterpart.  Similarly, the output coupling (DC-blocking) capacitors
C17 and C22 form high-pass filters together with the load impedance,
where we can again get away with a much higher corner frequency
(smaller capacitance) in the tweeter amp. We do not max out this
possibility (see the respective f<sub>c</sub> annotations), only to
the extent that a significantly cheaper and smaller component can be
used.  We choose high-quality capacitors specifically intended for
audio applications.</p>

<p>If you looked real close, you might have noticed one more discrepancy
across the amps: opposite polarities of output connectors J3 and J4.
That’s right, and reflect the fact that the Uxbridge driver cables
have their JST connectors crimped with opposite polarities; however,
both our amps are “straight” so one of them needs to have its output
polarity reversed.</p>

<p>What kind of output power can we expect? The PSU just clears the lower
end of the LM1875 supply range, so it’s going to be on the low
end. The low driver impedance (4Ω) certainly helps a bit.
Between the datasheet and some back of the envelope calculations, I
expect about 5W of peak output power per driver (in practice, this
applies to the woofer only; the tweeter will always be driven with
much less power).  That might seem low, but in practice, it is plenty
for near-field listening in a quiet room. Thankfully, the low supply
voltage also keeps dissipation down – a couple watts at most,
and a mere fraction of a watt idling.</p>

<h2 id="prototyping-and-tuning">Prototyping and tuning</h2>

<p>To validate the design in actual reality, I built a breadboard version
of the complete circuit, from line input to the actual speakers. To
ferret out any possible incompatibility, I powered it from the actual
Uxbridge PSU removed from one of the units.  This unit became my test
harness: I removed the original electronics, extended the speaker
wires and led them out via a small hole on the backplane (left in
place of the Bluetooth button). I fastened the backplane in place and
did my best to close the hole (with speaker wires protruding) using
some tape. This way I could evaluate circuit performance with the real
(non-ideal) speaker loads, together with real acoustics, and tune the
filters after listening to music and pure sine tones. I was also able
to A/B test, going back and forth between my circuit driving the
prepared (closed) enclosure and the other complete, intact Uxbridge
unit via Bluetooth.</p>

<p>I still haven’t built my first real DDS VFO / signal generator
instrument (it’s in the pipeline, should be complete any year now…).
For the time being, I reached for a “virtual” one by playing sine
frequencies via online tone generators (<a href="https://tonegen.net/">first</a>,
<a href="https://onlinetonegenerator.com/frequency-sweep-generator.html">second</a>).
I used them to establish general sanity, verify driver polarities, and
equalize levels through the crossover range. I also tuned the woofer
rolloff compensation filter with this method; I got satisfactory
results down to about 35&nbsp;Hz, which is on par with the original
unit. The upper end? Limited by my hearing abilities… N.B.: All
tuning and fiddling is already reflected in the circuits presented
above.</p>

<p>Speaking of A/B tests: I also listened to lots of music, mostly
assorted tracks and albums I enjoy and have been listening to all my
life across a wide range of equipment and acoustic environments. I
carefully compared the sound of the speakers; in a couple days, I
reached the point where I preferred the sound of the new circuit. I
believe it gives a flatter, more precise response especially in the
midrange, where the original Uxbridge sounded hollow. I’m no fan of
the “disco smile”; I prefer the mid to have some real bite.</p>

<p>Another reason I wanted a full prototype was to get a grip on the
thermal situation. Having done those back of the envelope estimates, I
was still quite uncertain about the amount of heat I could expect the
LM1875’s to dissipate, and wanted to gauge heatsink temperatures (with
the scientific “finger method”) both while idle and with realistic
listening volumes. My estimates were validated; the TO-220 heating
fins I planned for (and prototyped with) only got seriously warm at a
loudness level I could not hope to sustain without creating “social
problems”. Good, because there is not much point in putting a bigger
heatsink into the air-tight enclosure…</p>

<p>Apart from the sorry fact that I was listening in mono (and in a bad
way: only hearing one of the stereo channels!), everything seemed
rather promising. Now comes the part which is, by now, a routine job:
casting the circuit into permanent form by designing a professional
PCB.</p>

<h2 id="pcb-design">PCB design</h2>

<p>This is a small-ish analog circuit, and we have plenty of real estate!
We only need to match board size and hole patterns. We could go
high-tech and use SMT components, and easily reduce the PCB area by a
factor of two… but why bother?  All the components are readily
available, plugged into the breadboard. I would prefer to use them.</p>

<p>The complexity of this design is so low that the board is, in effect,
single layer. Almost all wiring is on the component side, the rest of
which is filled with a ground plane. The solder side is a complete
ground plane (except a single, short copper bridge connecting VCC
between C18 and C19). This double-sided, massive ground plane
contributes to the low noise and high performance of this amplifier.
A bunch of thermal vias under the heatsinks help the PCB take its part
in spreading and dissipating heat.</p>

<em>Printed circuit board (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>The dimensions are about half of the original panel – call me a
dinosaur, but I see no need to <a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/2024/03/SMT-and-the-ultimate-LCD-SPI-interface">design with
SMT</a> (requiring a
stencil mask for applying the paste) to make it even smaller!</p>

<p>Below, a side-by-side comparison of the new dumb analog dinosaur and
the original, fully digital smart technology:</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/panels-new-old.jpg"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/panels-new-old-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>Electronics, new vs. old (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<h2 id="connectors-and-mechanics">Connectors and mechanics</h2>

<p>Given the already crimped plugs on the PSU and speaker cables, I
naturally wanted to keep the connectors on the new panel identical.
The DC power connector was easily identified as JST-VH, and I had no
trouble buying it. On the other hand, it took me some time to identify
the speaker connectors as JST-XA. Worse, my local parts store did not
carry it. The dimensions of the XA are rather similar to the more
common JST-XH, except for the pin spacing (2.5 vs. 2.54&nbsp;mm, not a
big deal on a 2-pin connector). A more important detail is that the XH
lacks the XA’s locking mechanism.  In the end, I prototyped with XH
(mating with the XA counterparts on the speaker wires). Eventually, I
de-soldered the XA sockets from the original boards so I could solder
them into my PCBs.</p>

<p>For the audio input, I picked a 2-pin JST-PH connector (2&nbsp;mm
pitch), using a matching plug with a pre-crimped short pair of wires.
The bare ends were soldered to the female panel-mount RCA connector
conveniently fastened into the backplane hole
(⌀&nbsp;=&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;mm) formerly occupied by the Bluetooth
button. The back of the RCA connector was filled with hot glue to make
it air-tight.</p>

<p>When the time has come to assemble my born-again speakers, it became
clear that there was some obstacle preventing the back side from
settling into place. At first, I feared the biggest capacitor (C22)
colliding with the woofer magnet (during the design process, I
convinced myself there was enough clearance, but now got the scare
– my 3D skills suck!).  Finally, it turned out that omitting the
small cut-out on the board outline (visible on the left edge of the
original panel) was a mistake. That space was taken by the plastic
stem receiving the middle-left Phillips screw (looking from behind the
box). The issue is clearly visible in the below photo (look at the
middle hole along the left edge):</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/backplane-assembly.jpg"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/backplane-assembly-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>New panel in its place: can you spot the bug? (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/backplane-assembly-2.jpg">Another image</a> of
the second unit, exhibiting the same issue.</p>

<p>Well, out with the rasping set! I managed to remove just enough
material (about 2&nbsp;mm) from the plastic stem down to the required
depth to make space for the PCB edge. Plastic filings carefully
vacuumed out of the box. Success, with footnotes (there are <em>always</em>
footnotes)!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the past several weeks, I listened and re-listened to many of my
long-time favourite albums and all I can say is, I absolutely love the
sound of this pair of odd socks!  The listening experience is on par
with, or easily surpasses, any stereo I ever had (and I’ve had a few).
Even though I don’t have the means to measure, in the first hours of
listening I felt a dramatic step up in fidelity from the original
Uxbridge. I am convinced that tuning the active filters with the
speakers in the loop has given me a superior frequency response, and
the linear power amps at low power are likely to have less noise and
distortion. The sharp stereo imaging is another sign of high fidelity.
The fact that I got these “from the bin” for free (at least the
enclosures, power supplies and drivers) gives me a smile each time I
turn them on.</p>

<p>It appears that analog electronics in the audio range is more or less
a solved problem: discounting the obvious extremities of high power
(hundreds of watts) or really miniscule signal levels (microvolts), it
is not too difficult to create, with contemporary semiconductors, a
simple circuit charting seriously audiophile territory!</p>
