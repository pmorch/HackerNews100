</p>
  
<p>A few years ago at work, I had a project which offered an opportunity to look at the new generation of async-first, type-hint-driven Python web frameworks. For reasons which aren’t particularly relevant today, on that project I ended up choosing <a href="https://litestar.dev/">Litestar</a>, which is the one that <em>doesn’t</em> have a ravenous all-consuming hype machine surrounding it. And I’m very glad I did, because today I’m more convinced than ever it was the right choice, and for the last 18 months or so every new project I’ve started at my day job has been built with&nbsp;Litestar.</p>
<p>But even if you’re someone who does Python web apps for a living, and even if you’re someone who builds asynchronous type-hint-driven web apps, you might not be familiar with this absolute gem of the Python web ecosystem, and today I want to remedy&nbsp;that.</p>
<h2>A&nbsp;taste</h2>
<p>Here’s the traditional single-file-app&nbsp;demo:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>from</span><span> </span><span>litestar</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>Litestar</span><span>,</span> <span>get</span>


<span>@get</span><span>(</span><span>"/greet"</span><span>)</span>
<span>async</span> <span>def</span><span> </span><span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>f</span><span>"Hi, </span><span>{</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>!"</span>


<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>Litestar</span><span>([</span><span>greet</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You save this&nbsp;as <code>app.py</code>, run&nbsp;with <code>litestar run</code> or hand it directly to the <abbr title="Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface"><span>ASGI</span></abbr> server of your choice, and it launches a web application. You go&nbsp;to <code>/greet?name=Bob</code> and it replies “Hi, Bob!”. Leave out&nbsp;the <code>name</code> parameter and it responds with an <span>HTTP</span> 400 telling you&nbsp;the <code>name</code> parameter is&nbsp;required.</p>
<p>So what. Big deal. The FastAPI Evangelism Strike Force will be along soon to bury you under rocket-ship emoji while explaining that FastAPI does the same thing but a million times better. And if you’re a Java person used to Spring, or a .<span>NET</span>  person used to <span>ASP</span>.<span>NET</span> <span>MVC</span>, well, there’s nothing here that’s new to you; you’ve had this style of annotation/signature-driven framework for years (and in fact one thing I like about Litestar is how often it reminds me of the good parts of those frameworks). And did anyone tell you FastAPI does this, too!&nbsp;🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>
<p>But there are a lot of things that make Litestar stand out to me in the Python world. I’m going to pick out three to talk about today, and one of them is hiding in plain sight in that simple example&nbsp;application.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>What’s in a&nbsp;name?</strong></p>
<p>You might see older material referring to Litestar as “Starlite”, which was its original&nbsp;name.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.starlette.io/">Starlette</a> is a toolkit for doing async Python web development, which can be used standalone or as a component in a more complex library or framework. FastAPI still uses Starlette under the hood, for example. And Litestar originally was built on Starlette too, and was named “Starlite”, presumably in recognition of that. Over time, though, it dropped the Starlette dependency in favor of its own implementations for that functionality, and people on social media complained that the “Starlite” name was confusing, especially since Star<em>lette</em> was no longer being used. So the project which had been “Starlite” was renamed to Litestar for version 2.0, released in 2023, and has had that name ever&nbsp;since.</p>
</div>
<h3>Scaling (the other&nbsp;kind)</h3>
<p>It’s a bit unfortunate that the term “scaling” is almost always assumed to mean handling larger and larger quantities of traffic, because that’s only one axis on which any given piece of of technology can “scale” (and, I’d argue, possibly the least important one). The type of scaling I want to talk about here is scaling of a codebase: how does something (in this case, a web framework) help or hinder you as you deal with different amounts of&nbsp;code?</p>
<p>Django, for example, has a reputation for not scaling “down” all that well. You <em>can</em> do it if you really want to, and every so often someone will come up with a new demo of doing a Django project in a single Python file, but it’s just not something that comes naturally to Django. Quite the opposite: if you work through the official beginner Django tutorial and do things the “Django way”, you’ll have around a dozen files laid out in a specific structure of directories and subdirectories before you’ve written a single meaningful line of your own&nbsp;code. </p>
<p>But “micro” frameworks have often had the opposite problem: they’re great at starting out with a tiny single-file application, and then get painful as your codebase grows and needs to spread out (single-file Django approaches have the same problem: you have to do a lot of work to get a “micro-Django” working, and then you have to <em>undo</em> all that work as soon as the code grows large enough to be worth splitting across multiple&nbsp;files).</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example. Here’s a FastAPI equivalent of the basic Litestar application I showed&nbsp;above:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>from</span><span> </span><span>fastapi</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>FastAPI</span>


<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>FastAPI</span><span>()</span>

<span>@app</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"/greet"</span><span>)</span>
<span>async</span> <span>def</span><span> </span><span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>f</span><span>"Hello, </span><span>{</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>!"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Notice that&nbsp;the <code>get()</code> decorator here is attached to the application object. This is a common pattern (Flask/Quart do the same thing, for example, and Starlette used to but has deprecated its entire decorator-based routing system), but it creates a problem once you have multiple files. You need to import the main application object into the other files in order to decorate the routes, but you need to import the other files into your “main” application file to make sure the route registrations are visible from there, and now you have a circular import, and that doesn’t&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>The general solution these frameworks offer is some sort of alternative sub-application object which can act as a per-file route registry that’s safe to import into the file where your application object is defined. FastAPI calls this object an “<span>API</span> router”; Flask/Quart call it a “blueprint”. Either way, it’s a necessary construct for those frameworks because their route decorators are always bound to some parent object, either the application object in a single-file app or an “<span>API</span> router”/“blueprint”/etc. object in a multi-file&nbsp;app.</p>
<p>That solves the circular-import problem, but creates a new issue: the whiz-bang quickstart demos of “micro” frameworks generally register all the example routes on the application object in a single file in order to keep everything as simple and flashy as possible, but now in order to build a real application (which will almost never stay in a single file) you’ll need to use a different mechanism, or start out following the demo and then switch later on. You also have to <em>know</em> about that different mechanism; in one framework’s documentation that I looked at, you can (at the time I’m writing this post) apparently get 40 pages into the user guide before encountering the section on how to register routes in a multi-file app&nbsp;😖😖😖.</p>
<p>Litestar avoids this entire mess by having the route decorators be standalone functions, not bound to a parent application or application-like object. This may seem like a small thing to focus on, but if you’ve spent time with popular Python microframeworks you’ve probably had to deal with the transition from single- to multi-file&nbsp;applications.</p>
<p>More importantly, this small change in approach frees up Litestar’s documentation to introduce route-grouping constructs early on and to present them as part of <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/applications.html#layered-architecture">a coherent layered architecture/configuration concept</a> rather than as an escape hatch for avoiding circular imports. Which is great, because Litestar’s layered architecture is one of its best features: its grouping constructs, and their ability to share configuration, offer an elegant way to compose functionality. For example, a common pattern I use when writing a set of <abbr title="Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete"><span>CRUD</span></abbr> endpoints looks like&nbsp;this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>from</span><span> </span><span>litestar</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>Router</span>
<span>from</span><span> </span><span>litestar.di</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>Provide</span>

<span># Imagine some CRUD routes for widgets defined here...</span>

<span>_write_widget_router</span> <span>=</span> <span>Router</span><span>(</span>
    <span>guards</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>some_auth_function</span><span>],</span>
    <span>route_handlers</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>
        <span>create_widget</span><span>,</span>
        <span>delete_widget</span><span>,</span>
        <span>update_widget</span><span>,</span>
    <span>]</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>widget_router</span> <span>=</span> <span>Router</span><span>(</span>
    <span>dependencies</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>"widget_dependency"</span><span>:</span> <span>Provide</span><span>(</span><span>some_widget_dependency</span><span>)},</span>
    <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>"/widgets"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>route_handlers</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>
        <span>get_widget</span><span>,</span>
        <span>get_widget_list</span><span>,</span>
        <span>_write_widget_router</span><span>,</span>
    <span>]</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This provides a single&nbsp;“public” <code>Router</code> instance with all the widget routes, all of which have access to the same core dependencies, but with the data-modifying routes also having auth applied. That composability is extremely powerful, and is less obvious if the “router” has to be introduced initially as a way to solve circular-import&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>Litestar’s approach also means it’s easy to do things like register a single route multiple times, each with different configuration. Which enables use cases&nbsp;like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different authentication/authorization schemes for each registration. For example, a data-editing route might be written once, and registered once under a router which applies <span>API</span> key auth for machine-to-machine requests, then registered again under a router which uses session auth for interaction by a human&nbsp;user.</li>
<li>Different sets of dependencies for each registration. For example, a route which queries and returns a list of widgets might just declare that it accepts an argument of&nbsp;type <code>WidgetRepository</code>, and leave it up to the router configuration to decide whether to dependency-inject one that sees all widgets, or perhaps only a subset, or only those which are active,&nbsp;etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you know what you’re doing, you can emulate some of this in the FastAPI/Flask style of bound route registration, but the techniques you’ll end up using for that feel to me like fighting against the framework, which is something I usually want to&nbsp;avoid.</p>
<h2>Not to be too&nbsp;Pydantic</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/">Pydantic</a> is a popular package for defining schema objects which perform validation and serialization/deserialization, driven by Python type annotations, and one major use case for this is the input/output schemas of web applications. FastAPI appears to use Pydantic exclusively, which comes with both upsides and downsides. Pydantic is very useful and very powerful, of course, but it also means FastAPI is somewhat limited by what Pydantic can support: mostly, this is Pydantic’s own classes, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html">the Python standard&nbsp;library’s <code>dataclasses</code></a>.</p>
<p>One crucial limitation is an inability to derive validation/serialization behavior directly from <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr> classes, even though they both support a very similar type-annotation-based declaration format. Which means that to use SQLAlchemy with a Pydantic-only framework (and SQLAlchemy is basically <em>the</em> standard database toolkit and <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr> for Python), you either have to write out the shape of your data multiple times—once for SQLAlchemy, and then at least one more time (possibly more than one time) for Pydantic—or turn to a third-party package to help bridge the gap. FastAPI’s author worked around this by writing <a href="https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/">a new <span>DB</span> toolkit which combines SQLAlchemy and Pydantic</a>, and pushing it in FastAPI’s&nbsp;documentation.</p>
<p>Litestar, meanwhile, <em>supports</em> Pydantic, but is not <em>tightly coupled to</em> Pydantic, which gives a bit more flexibility. By default Litestar lets you define input/output schemas using Pydantic&nbsp;models, <code>dataclasses</code>, or <a href="https://jcristharif.com/msgspec/">msgspec</a>; ships with plugins to enable the use of <a href="https://www.attrs.org/">attrs</a> and of SQLAlchemy models; and <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/plugins/index.html#serializationpluginprotocol">provides a protocol for writing your own serialization plugins</a> to extend support to other kinds of&nbsp;objects.</p>
<p>That’s very convenient already, but the convenience is amplified by Litestar’s <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/dto/1-abstract-dto.html">system for automatically deriving data-transfer objects</a> from data-access or domain objects. Suppose, for example, that we have the following SQLAlchemy model&nbsp;class:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>from</span><span> </span><span>sqlalchemy.orm</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>DeclarativeBase</span><span>,</span> <span>Mapped</span><span>,</span> <span>mapped_column</span>

<span>Base</span> <span>=</span> <span>DeclarativeBase</span><span>()</span>

<span>class</span><span> </span><span>Widget</span><span>(</span><span>Base</span><span>):</span>
    <span>__tablename__</span> <span>=</span> <span>"widget"</span>

    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>Mapped</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>mapped_column</span><span>(</span><span>primary_key</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
    <span>internal_notes</span><span>:</span> <span>Mapped</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]</span>
    <span>sku</span><span>:</span> <span>Mapped</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>mapped_column</span><span>(</span><span>unique</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>Mapped</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]</span>
    <span>price_cents</span><span>:</span> <span>Mapped</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In a Pydantic-only world, we’d need to write multiple Pydantic models representing different use&nbsp;cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>A “read” schema for use in <span>HTTP</span> responses, which would probably not include&nbsp;the <code>internal_notes</code> field and probably also&nbsp;not <code>id</code> (since <code>sku</code> is more likely to be the public&nbsp;identifier)</li>
<li>A “write” schema for creating widgets, which would&nbsp;exclude <code>id</code> since that likely is auto-generated on&nbsp;insert</li>
<li>Another “write” schema for updating widgets, setting all fields optional to allow partial&nbsp;update</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as possibly more schemas like an admin-view “read” schema that does include the internal fields, etc. Even if you get clever and use inheritance to share field definitions among all these Pydantic classes, you still will write out the full set of fields for widgets at least twice, and the second time it will be fragmented across multiple Pydantic classes, creating the risk of making a change to the <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr> model and forgetting to update all the corresponding field definitions in the Pydantic&nbsp;models.</p>
<p>Litestar’s approach is a significant improvement on this. For example, here’s how to use Litestar’s <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span>DTO</span></abbr> helpers to define the “read”&nbsp;schema:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>from</span><span> </span><span>litestar.dto</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>DTOConfig</span>
<span>from</span><span> </span><span>litestar.plugins.sqlalchemy</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>SQLAlchemyDTO</span>

<span>class</span><span> </span><span>ReadWidget</span><span>(</span><span>SQLAlchemyDTO</span><span>[</span><span>Widget</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>DTOConfig</span><span>(</span><span>exclude</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>"id"</span><span>,</span> <span>"internal_notes"</span><span>})</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will give you a <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span>DTO</span></abbr> class containing all the fields of&nbsp;the <code>Widget</code> <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr> model <em>except</em> the two explicitly excluded, and will derive that set of fields, and the correct data types, from&nbsp;introspecting <code>Widget</code>. It will also automatically handle conversion to and from instances&nbsp;of <code>Widget</code> when you specify it as the input or return <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span>DTO</span></abbr> type of a route. Similarly, it’s possible to declare a list of fields to include, or to re-map field names for public consumption, or to declare a <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span>DTO</span></abbr> which makes fields optional for partial updates. This means there’s only one canonical definition of the fields—on the original class, which might be a SQLAlchemy <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr> model, might be&nbsp;a <code>dataclass</code>, etc.—and it doesn’t have to be repeated in the DTOs because the DTOs will always derive their field definitions directly from the source class you point them&nbsp;at.</p>
<p>Of course, there are going to be cases where your DTOs are sufficiently different from your DAOs and domain objects that this isn’t a big help, but my own experience is that “the <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span>DTO</span></abbr> is a subset of the <abbr title="Data Access Object"><span>DAO</span></abbr>’s fields” is extremely common in real-world applications, so Litestar’s approach really pays off in both reduced boilerplate and reduced errors from manual “transcription” of fields between different class&nbsp;definitions.</p>
<h2>Alchemical&nbsp;architecture</h2>
<p>I wasn’t exaggerating earlier when I said that SQLAlchemy is <em>the</em> database toolkit and <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr> for Python. While there are others out there, the only one I’m aware of that sees anything close to SQLAlchemy’s usage is the Django <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr>, and only because it’s built into and tightly integrated with Django. So if you’re going to be writing a database-backed web application in Python, and you’re not doing Django, you are almost certainly going to be using&nbsp;SQLAlchemy.</p>
<p>And Litestar makes that easy. While officially remaining agnostic as to whether you even have a persistence layer, it still includes good integrations for SQLAlchemy: the serialization plugin mentioned earlier allows the direct use of SQLAlchemy <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr> classes as input and output schemas; the <abbr title="Data Transfer Object"><span>DTO</span></abbr> helpers can derive subsets and remappings of fields from SQLAlchemy <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr> classes; and Litestar also ships with <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/databases/sqlalchemy/plugins/sqlalchemy_init_plugin.html">a plugin that manages a SQLAlchemy engine and per-request <abbr title="Object-Relational Mapper"><span>ORM</span></abbr> session for you</a>, as well as <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/databases/sqlalchemy/plugins/sqlalchemy_plugin.html">a single SQLAlchemy mega-plugin</a> combining all the SQLAlchemy plugins’&nbsp;functionality.</p>
<p>So it’s already pretty convenient to use SQLAlchemy in Litestar applications. But there’s more! The Litestar team also maintains <a href="https://docs.advanced-alchemy.litestar.dev/latest/">the excellent Advanced Alchemy library</a> which provides a bunch of useful features on top of SQLAlchemy. While Advanced Alchemy is framework-agnostic, Litestar’s SQLAlchemy plugin makes use of it and re-exports much of its functionality, giving you access to it automatically, and it does include Litestar-specific helpers for registering certain utility classes with Litestar’s dependency&nbsp;injection.</p>
<p>Advanced Alchemy provides a lot of quality-of-life improvements for SQLAlchemy, including a variety of base classes and mixins and data types doing useful things like database-agnostic big-integer primary keys, automatic create/update timestamps, <abbr title="Universally Unique IDentifier"><span>UUID</span></abbr>-keyed models, a proper <abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time"><span>UTC</span></abbr> timestamp type, and a <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation"><span>JSON</span></abbr> type which chooses the best column type for your database. There are also command-line helpers for database management (including creating and working with <a href="https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/">Alembic migrations</a>), database dumping and seeding to/from <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation"><span>JSON</span></abbr>, and a lot&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>But the place where Advanced Alchemy really shines is in providing <a href="https://docs.advanced-alchemy.litestar.dev/latest/usage/repositories.html">a generic repository implementation</a> (both sync and async flavors) on top of SQLAlchemy models, along with <a href="https://docs.advanced-alchemy.litestar.dev/latest/usage/services.html">a service-layer abstraction</a> and helpers to integrate them into Litestar’s dependency injection&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>Here’s a basic example using&nbsp;the <code>Widget</code> class from&nbsp;above:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>from</span><span> </span><span>litestar.plugins.sqlalchemy</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>repository</span>

<span>class</span><span> </span><span>WidgetRepository</span><span>(</span><span>repository</span><span>.</span><span>SQLAlchemyAsyncRepository</span><span>[</span><span>Widget</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>model_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>Widget</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>WidgetRepository</code> will have all the methods you’d&nbsp;expect—<code>list()</code>, <code>get_one()</code>, <code>add()</code>, <code>delete()</code>, etc.—automatically derived from&nbsp;the <code>Widget</code> model. And let me just say that having repository implementations automatically derived from any SQLAlchemy model, with not just basic <abbr title="Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete"><span>CRUD</span></abbr> operations but also things like paginated fetches, is a <em>massive</em> productivity boost compared to just using vanilla SQLAlchemy. It’s maybe not quite on the level of Django’s generic views, but it’s a big step in that direction, and you probably could produce something like Django’s generic views with Litestar and Advanced Alchemy if you wanted to (perhaps one day, in my copious free time, I’ll even make an attempt at&nbsp;it).</p>
<p>I know it may seem strange to hear me saying this, since a few years ago I went on record as being strongly <em>against</em> these sorts of abstractions—specifically service layers—in Django. And I still think you absolutely should not try to retrofit repository or service-layer abstractions onto Django! They’re not the native patterns of Django’s architecture, and instead I think you should stick to <a href="https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2020/mar/16/no-service/">what I recommended back then</a>, which is to leverage Django’s own architecture, especially its “manager” abstraction, rather than trying to force abstractions onto it that don’t&nbsp;fit.</p>
<p>I also still think there are a lot of bad use cases for repositories and service layers that people should avoid, but that’s a digression which should probably become its own post, so I’ll just say for now that I think it’s fine to use repositories and service layers <em>as an organizing principle</em> when you’re using a less-structured framework which doesn’t express strong opinions about how you should lay out your code. And that’s exactly what I do when working with&nbsp;Litestar.</p>
<h2>A lightweight star of&nbsp;Python</h2>
<p>There are plenty of other features and conveniences in Litestar, many of which I use daily. Its auth system, supporting both <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/security/guards.html">simple guard functions</a> and <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/security/abstract-authentication-middleware.html">middlewares</a> for attaching identity and complex authn/authz logic to requests. Its <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/stores.html">“stores” framework</a>, which makes caching and similar tasks convenient. Its <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/logging.html">logging integrations</a> which support both the Python standard&nbsp;library’s <code>logging</code> module and popular third-party tools&nbsp;like <code>structlog</code>. Its built-in support for <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/plugins/problem_details.html">transforming errors to standard “problem details” structures</a>. Its built-in support for <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/metrics/index.html">recording and exporting metrics in standard Prometheus or OpenTelemetry formats</a>. Its <a href="https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/usage/htmx.html">htmx support</a>.</p>
<p>You can do this stuff in other microframeworks, but it typically involves a lot of tracking down of third-party add-ons and/or writing your own glue code to integrate things. Litestar manages to keep the “microframework” feel when starting a new project while also having all these nice bits optionally available with the framework itself when and if you decide you want them, and that’s nothing to sneeze at. That’s what I was getting at earlier when I said it reminds me of the things I like in certain frameworks from other languages. Litestar doesn’t feel, to me, like it’s trying to be a replacement for any pre-existing Python web framework. It’s not trying to be the next Django or the next Flask or whatever; instead, it feels to me like a Pythonic take on the good parts of something like Spring Boot (and the way I like to set it up, doing things like using <a href="https://svcs.hynek.me/en/stable/">svcs</a> behind the scenes as a service locator to feed things to both Litestar’s and <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest’s</a> dependency injection, makes it feel even more that&nbsp;way).</p>
<p>I could go on for a lot longer listing things I like about Litestar, and probably wind up way too far into my own subjective preferences, but hopefully I’ve given you enough of a realistic taste of what it offers that, next time you’re about to build a Python web app, you might decide to reach for 💡⭐ to carry you to the moon&nbsp;🚀🚀🚀.</p>

                                                <p>In 2020, 2022, and 2024, our nation held federal elections. Despite the pandemic, threats of violence, denial of results, and extraordinary pressure, these were secure and accurate. Election officials worked together across party lines.&nbsp;The system held.</p><p>This year, however, a new threat to free and fair elections has emerged: the federal government itself.</p><p>The Trump administration has launched a concerted drive to undermine American elections. These moves are unprecedented and in some cases illegal. They began with the pardon of the January 6 defendants who sought to overturn the 2020 results. They include affirmative attacks on democratic institutions, the repeal and withdrawal of voter protections, and symbolic or demonstrative moves. A clear pattern suggests a growing effort. As the 2026 midterms approach, that effort will likely gather momentum.</p><p>This resource offers the first chronicle of the Trump administration’s actions this year to undermine election integrity. They include:</p><ul><li>attempting to rewrite election rules to burden voters and usurp control of election systems;</li><li>targeting or threatening to target election officials and others who keep elections free and fair;</li><li>supporting people who undermine election administration; and</li><li>retreating from the federal government’s role of protecting voters and the election process.</li></ul><p>Why do we conclude this represents a concerted strategy? Among other things, President Trump tried to do this before. He was the first president to try to overturn the results of a presidential election and used federal power to do so. Institutions and key officials blocked him. These internal checks, however, are now gone, and many public officials will likely carry out the president’s will.</p><p>This campaign to undermine elections runs afoul of the U.S. Constitution. Only Congress and the states can set election rules. The executive branch, especially the Department of Justice (DOJ), is charged with&nbsp;enforcing&nbsp;federal laws. But neither the president nor the DOJ has the authority to set rules governing elections or to supervise the state and local officials who run them.</p><p>To be sure, previous elections were marred by rules and practices that hindered full participation.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-september-2024">Restrictive voting laws</a> (some of which had already been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/court-cases/lupe-v-state-texas">ruled unconstitutional</a>),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-gerrymandering-tilts-2024-race-house">skewed maps</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/preparation-kept-bomb-threats-disrupting-2024-elections">bomb threats</a> at polling places impeded the freedom to vote.

This federal protection for fair elections may no longer exist.</p><p>This unprecedented federal push will place new pressure on American elections and will require vigilance and actions from those determined to defend the integrity of the vote.</p>

          <h2>Attempting to Rewrite Election Rules and Interfere with Election Administration via Executive Order</h2>
        </header>
                                          <p>In March 2025, President Trump issued an&nbsp;<a href="https://perma.cc/A7K6-XV74">executive order&nbsp;</a>that aims to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/presidents-executive-order-elections-explained">overhaul and exert partial control</a> over significant parts of the nation’s election systems. The order includes several provisions; here we highlight three.</p><p>First, the order purports to direct the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) — an independent, bipartisan agency that assists states with election administration — to mandate that voters show a passport or other, similar document proving citizenship when they register to vote using the federal voter registration form.</p><p>Second, it attempts to force the EAC to&nbsp;amend its guidelines to rescind all previous certifications of voting equipment based on prior standards and, if appropriate, to re-certify voting systems under amended guidelines, which are to include provisions from the executive order.&nbsp;Eleven states and Washington, D.C.,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/State%20Requirements%20for%20Certification%202023.pdf">require</a> their systems to be federally certified. And even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voting-system-standards-testing-and-certification">states that do not require federal certification</a> typically incorporate federal guidelines and testing and use voting systems that have been federally certified. Yet currently, just one voting system on the market complies with the standards issued prior to the executive order, and it was only&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/Hart_Verity_Vanguard_1.0_EAC_Certificate_and_Scope_of_Conformance.pdf">certified on July 7, 2025</a>. Replacing machines could cost states billions of dollars.</p><p>The president’s attempt to interfere with voting systems is not novel. In his first term, he tried to direct the attorney general, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-directly-involved-plans-seize-voting-machines-reports-2022-02-01/">seize voting machines</a>. He was unsuccessful. Yet now there are signs that the federal government may already be attempting to interfere with voting systems, beyond anything expressed in the executive order. A DHS official&nbsp;and an individual claiming to work for the administration have asked election officials in Colorado for access to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/16/trump-voter-fraud-elections/">their voting equipment</a>.</p><p>Third, the order calls on the administration’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and DHS to obtain state voter files and other records kept by election officials, including voter list maintenance records. The DOJ has already requested voter lists from at least&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/16/trump-voter-fraud-elections/">nine states</a>, and at least two have provided them. Unredacted voter files and voter list maintenance records can contain sensitive private information about U.S. citizens. Other records may contain information that is subject to access controls for security reasons. Relatedly, the order mandates that states have access to federal citizenship data for voter list maintenance purposes; DHS recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/04/22/dhs-uscis-doge-overhaul-systematic-alien-verification-entitlements-database" target="_blank" title="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/04/22/dhs-uscis-doge-overhaul-systematic-alien-verification-entitlements-database">overhauled</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/uscis-deploys-common-sense-tools-to-verify-voters" target="_blank" title="https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/uscis-deploys-common-sense-tools-to-verify-voters">expanded</a> the scope of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/homeland-securitys-save-program-exacerbates-risks-voters">program for states&nbsp;</a>to identify supposed noncitizens on the voter rolls.</p><p>Each of these provisions is analyzed in turn.</p><h3>Attempting to Impose a “Show Your Papers” Requirement on Voters</h3><p><strong>Impact:</strong> If implemented, the requirement to show a citizenship document to register to vote when using the federal form would undermine voting and disrupt election administration in multiple respects. The “show your papers” provision, which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/presidents-executive-order-elections-explained#:~:text=Is%20this%20executive,place%20by%20fiat.">overlaps significantly</a> with the policy laid out in the deeply unpopular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/save-act-would-undermine-voter-registration-all-americans">SAVE Act</a> (which has stalled in the U.S. Senate), could block millions of American citizens from voting. According to research by the Brennan Center, more than 21 million citizens do not have a birth certificate, a passport, or naturalization papers readily available.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Wrong:</strong> A president has no right to rewrite the country’s election rules or regulate federal elections on his own.&nbsp;As a federal court&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/media/13927/download/2025-4-24-memo-op-and-order-granting-pi.pdf">recently</a> put it, “The Constitution vests none of these powers in the President.” In issuing the order, the president claimed extraordinary unilateral authority to regulate federal elections and usurp the powers of Congress, the states, and the EAC, an independent, bipartisan federal agency.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> The order was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/107087/tracker-litigation-legal-challenges-trump-administration/">challenged</a> in five lawsuits across the country. Two courts have blocked some provisions while litigation proceeds, including those directing the EAC to add a requirement to show a passport or naturalization document to register to vote in federal elections. The same reasoning — that the president lacks authority to compel the EAC to act — would apply to other parts of the order that have not yet been carried out. Litigation is ongoing.&nbsp;</p><h3>Meddling with Election Equipment</h3><p><strong>Impact:</strong> The president’s directive in the executive order undermines faith in elections and voting machines and provides pretext for election deniers to discredit outcomes in the future. Any attempt to access voting machines by the administration makes this risk more pronounced. It may also encourage states to opt for hand-counting ballots, an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/hand-counting-votes-proven-bad-idea">error-prone process that can cause certification delays</a>.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Wrong:</strong> The president does not have the authority to regulate elections, including voting equipment guidelines. Nor does he have the power to direct the EAC, an independent agency, in any manner, as a federal court recently affirmed. And though certain federal agencies have authority to offer technical assistance or issue guidelines for voting equipment, none has authority to take exclusive custody of voting equipment for inspection. States also have rules on who can access equipment. In Colorado, for example, once someone other than an election official or other authorized person accesses a voting system, use of the equipment&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/rule_making/CurrentRules/8CCR1505-1/Rule20.pdf">can be prohibited</a>.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> Washington and Oregon have&nbsp;<a href="https://agportal-s3bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Elections%20Complaint.pdf?VersionId=NID68BFYNfX7zW0p.e9hZ.yFk7O_VgCE" target="_blank">challenged</a>&nbsp;the executive order’s provisions purporting to amend voting system guidelines. That litigation is ongoing. And though the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/2025-06/DRAFT_Voluntary_Voting_System%20Guidelines_Version_2.1_TGDC_Member_Review.pdf" target="_blank">EAC has drafted</a>&nbsp;voting system guidelines pursuant to the order, the agency still must follow several steps under federal law before the guidelines can be implemented, including consulting with advisory boards of nonpartisan experts and posting the guidelines for public comment.</p><h3>Accessing Sensitive Voter File Data</h3><p><strong>Impact:</strong> The administration could abuse voter file access to claim fraud and erode public trust in elections; it could also pressure state officials to target groups of voters and carry out unwarranted voter purges. Any disclosure of sensitive personal information puts individuals and groups at risk of being intimidated or doxed. And mishandling voter file data could expose U.S. elections to political and foreign interference.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Wrong:</strong> DOGE has a track record of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/15/nx-s1-5355896/doge-nlrb-elon-musk-spacex-security">mishandling sensitive data</a>. For example, within minutes after it gained access to the National Labor Relations Board’s systems in March 2025, someone with a Russian IP address made several attempts to access the database using one of the department’s newly created accounts. Those attempts were blocked, but the fact that foreign adversaries were able to immediately make such attempts indicates that election systems and the data they hold risk being compromised when left in the hands of DOGE. And for its part, DHS has previously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/holding-homeland-security-accountable">failed to fulfill its privacy obligations</a>.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> Depending on how DOGE or DHS uses or discloses data, it may run afoul of federal law, including the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedures Act. In some states, giving voter records to the federal government without written consent from voters would also be a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/Legal_Implications_of_Kobach_Request.pdf">violation of state law</a>; in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-02/public_interest_legal_foundation_v._bellows_no._23-1361_1st_cir._02.02.24.pdf">others</a>, redaction would be required.</p>

          <h2>Targeting Election Officials and Civil Society</h2>
        </header>
                                          <p>The Trump administration, falsely claiming that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, has already targeted organizations and individuals it sees as adverse with baseless or inappropriate retaliatory actions. It now threatens to do the same with certain election officials, civic groups that mobilize voters, and other individuals and entities that protect elections and the rule of law. These kinds of actions can be tools of retribution, intimidation, or coercion.&nbsp;</p><h3>Weaponizing Federal Agencies&nbsp;</h3><p>A set of new federal task forces — the DOJ’s Weaponization Working Group, the New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s Office&nbsp;<a href="https://perma.cc/CL39-4FSN">Election Integrity Task Force</a>, and the Washington, D.C., Attorney’s Office&nbsp;<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/dc-prosecutor-ed-martin-launches-election-accountability-unit">Special Unit: Election Accountability</a> — establish a federal law enforcement approach to elections focused on targeting voters, election officials, perceived political adversaries, and journalists. The task forces devote resources to search for supposedly widespread voter fraud — a problem that doesn’t exist — and sanction political targeting.</p><blockquote><p>“They are poised to enable election interference by investigating perceived adversaries, targeting election officials, and casting doubt on election systems.”</p></blockquote><p>Political appointees who have spread falsehoods about the outcome of the 2020 election, including U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet&nbsp;Dhillon, and FBI Director Kash Patel, have empowered and enabled these task forces.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/pam-bondis-recent-history-troubling-doj">Bondi</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/12/10/trump-civil-rights-justice-department-dhillon/">Dhillon</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/meet-kash-patel-the-maga-diehard-donald-trump-tapped-to-lead-the-fbi?srsltid=AfmBOop0G47iKEIkeB_RGKpi9tVCTLxtKurOuVSorOk6pHcz9WElIEEN">Patel</a> have also made clear they are willing to use the federal government to investigate and prosecute people they claim are responsible for supposed election fraud. Patel has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/us/politics/kash-patel-fbi.html">stated</a>, “We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections — we’re going to come after you.”&nbsp;Bondi, in one of her first actions as attorney general, created the Weaponization Working Group, whose purpose is to “review the activities of all departments and agencies exercising civil or criminal enforcement authority of the United States over the last four years.” The administration has instructed the group to investigate some of the president’s perceived enemies, including former Special Counsel Jack Smith and his staff for investigating the January 6 riots, the Manhattan district attorney and the New York state attorney general for their involvement in the prosecution of Trump and his businesses, and anyone who investigated or prosecuted the January 6 rioters.</p><p><strong>Impact:</strong> During President Trump’s first term in office, federal agencies and departments occasionally served as a restraint on his unlawful actions. For example, when the president asked the attorney general to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-directly-involved-plans-seize-voting-machines-reports-2022-02-01/">seize voting machines</a> after his 2020 election loss, then Attorney General Bill Barr refused. But in his second term, the president’s picks may not hold the line in the same way. Rather, they are poised to enable election interference by investigating perceived adversaries, targeting election officials, and casting doubt on election systems.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Wrong:</strong> The DOJ can and should prosecute fraud in U.S. elections, but these task forces are premised on the false notions that U.S. elections are rigged and that there’s rampant voter fraud. Rather than ensuring election integrity, these task forces undermine it, part of the department’s serious shift away from protecting voting rights.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> The Constitution and the law serve as a limit on what these political appointees can do. Indeed, courts have already struck down this administration’s attempts to subvert the law. For example, multiple courts have found that the president’s executive orders targeting law firms violate the First Amendment, and two courts have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/court-cases/league-women-voters-v-trump">preliminarily</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.282905/gov.uscourts.mad.282905.107.0.pdf">stopped</a> the president from unlawfully trying to direct an independent, bipartisan agency to add a citizenship document requirement to the federal voter registration form.&nbsp;</p><h3>Penalizing Law Firms</h3><p>The president issued executive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/latest-law-firm-targeted-in-executive-order-says-there-is-no-question-that-we-will-fight">orders revoking the federal security clearances of six law firms</a> and prohibiting the federal government from contracting with them. These firms had been involved in litigation protecting voting rights and are associated with people who challenged the January 6 attack on the Capitol, attempts to overturn the 2020 election, and election interference in 2016. The president specifically cited these associations as justification for targeting the firms. For example, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/DCPD-202500359/pdf/DCPD-202500359.pdf">Paul Weiss</a> order was based in part on the firm employing a lawyer who brought a lawsuit against an individual who had participated in the January 6 insurrection. The&nbsp;<a href="https://perma.cc/6E42-6S6B">Perkins Coie</a> order provided that the firm had represented a political opponent of the president, brought challenges to restrictive voter ID laws that made it harder for eligible citizens to vote, and, as the court enjoining the order&nbsp;<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69725919/185/perkins-coie-llp-v-us-department-of-justice/">stated</a>, brought “election-related lawsuits&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;challenging actions supported by the president or his campaign.”&nbsp;<a href="https://perma.cc/7KXU-QL5Z">Jenner &amp; Block</a> was targeted because it employed Andrew Weissman, who, as the court enjoining the order&nbsp;<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69807126/138/jenner-block-llp-v-us-department-of-justice/">stated</a>, “drew presidential disdain” for criticizing the president and&nbsp;participating “in a legitimate investigation of election interference”&nbsp;— that is, the investigation and prosecution of the president’s campaign team for crimes related to foreign interference in the 2016 election. The association with Weissman “extended that disdain to the firm,” the court added. And&nbsp;<a href="https://perma.cc/J6XM-U224">Covington &amp; Burling</a>, according to the executive order, “assisted former Special Counsel Jack Smith.” The firm had provided Smith with free legal advice when he was investigating the January 6 riots.</p><p><strong>Impact:</strong> By targeting law firms for providing legal services — including free legal services — to causes the administration disapproves of, including protecting the freedom to vote, the orders have had a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/business/trump-law-firms-pro-bono-immigration.html">chilling effect</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-orders-target-law-firms-some-lawyers-say-that-threatens-rule-of-law-60-minutes-transcript/">firms</a>, including those that have not been directly targeted, diminishing the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/13/g-s1-59497/trump-law-firms-pro-bono">legal resources</a> available to Americans whose voting rights have been violated. To some extent, the nonprofit sector and state attorneys general have stepped up to provide needed legal support, but gaps remain. This chilling effect extends beyond law firms. For instance, it may compel prosecutors to avoid pursuing charges against election interference. And the administration’s attempt to punish some of the most powerful and well-resourced legal institutions in the country sends a potent message to anyone considering taking a position the administration may oppose.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Wrong:</strong> As multiple courts have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/27/g-s1-70443/trump-law-firm-susman-godfrey-ruling">found</a>, these actions are illegal. The First Amendment prohibits government officials from retaliating against protected speech or association, including retaliating against law firms that represent or offer legal services to those engaged in protected speech or association whom the president happens to disfavor.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> Four of the targeted law firms challenged their respective executive orders, and judges have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/27/g-s1-70443/trump-law-firm-susman-godfrey-ruling">permanently blocked</a> the orders for violating the First Amendment. Despite the clear illegality of the orders,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/law-firms-deals-trump.html">nine firms</a> have entered into agreements with the administration. As part of those agreements, these firms said they would provide free legal services for causes that the president approves of.&nbsp;</p><h3>Threatening Election Officials and Nonprofits</h3><p>The president and his DOJ appointees have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/whats-next-elections-under-project-2025-agenda">repeatedly threatened</a> to prosecute the election officials who administered the 2020 election. In a March 14, 2025, speech, President Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-calls-jailing-perceived-opponents-justice-department-speech-rcna196515?utm_source=Democracy+Docket+Newsletters&amp;utm_campaign=e2a243ed96-20250319_EyeOnTheRight_LF&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-513211276f-607194689&amp;mc_cid=e2a243ed96&amp;mc_eid=3ede2f915b">stated</a>, “What a difference a rigged and crooked election had on our country. And the people who did this to us should go to jail. They should go to jail.”&nbsp;The president has also threatened to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/10/trump-administration-authoritarian">target nonprofit advocacy groups</a> that play an important role in voter engagement, election monitoring, and litigation to protect the freedom to vote.</p><p>These threats roughly track a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/project-2025s-anti-voter-agenda">proposal</a> in Project 2025, the controversial conservative policy agenda created by the Heritage Foundation, to prosecute people who protected the 2020 election with federal crimes. Project 2025 proposed charging election officials with criminal conspiracy to injure civil rights for their alleged misapplication of state law to <em>help</em> voters cast ballots during the 2020 election.</p><blockquote><p>“Federal and state law prohibits anyone, including federal officials, from intimidating voters and those, like election officials or civic engagement organizations, who assist or encourage them to vote.”</p></blockquote><p>The extent to which the administration will follow through on that plan is unclear, but it has already begun to target officials involved in protecting the 2020 election and build an infrastructure of task forces and working groups that heightens the threat of criminal prosecution. In one executive order, the president&nbsp;<a href="https://perma.cc/H39J-D2FW">directed</a>&nbsp;the DOJ to review the actions of Chris Krebs, whom the president appointed to lead the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in 2018, because he “denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen.”</p><p>In addition to its Weaponization Working Group, the DOJ is reportedly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/us/politics/justice-department-election-data.html">exploring ways</a> to criminally charge election officials for failing to maintain proper cybersecurity — based not on evidence but on assumptions driven by false claims of rampant voter fraud.</p><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Criminal investigations and prosecutions would impose a severe personal and financial toll on election officials or nonprofit employees for simply doing their jobs to help keep elections free and fair. But beyond that, the harms that stem from targeting the officials and civil society groups that make our elections work are manifold.</p><p>Even if the administration never charges any officials, the threat alone of criminal investigation or prosecution will likely exacerbate the exodus of election officials from their jobs. In 2024&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/local-election-officials-survey-may-2024">33 percent</a> of local election officials knew at least one colleague who resigned at least in part due to fear for their safety, of increased threats, or of intimidation; 21 percent stated that they were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/local-election-officials-survey-may-2024">unlikely</a> to continue serving in their role for the 2026 midterms.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/local-election-officials-survey-july-2025">In 2025</a> 59 percent of officials reported fear of political interference in their ability to do their jobs. And 46 percent were very or somewhat concerned about potential politically motivated investigations of themselves or their peers. Ultimately the drain of experienced officials from U.S. elections will hurt voters.</p><p>The threat of criminal investigation may also prompt civil society organizations to retreat from their work to engage voters. When Florida recently passed a law threatening organizations conducting voter registration drives with civil and criminal penalties for violating a slew of new restrictive regulations, some organizations curtailed their work or&nbsp;<a href="https://boltsmag.org/florida-law-sb-7050-restricts-outside-groups-trying-to-register-new-voters/">stopped</a> registering voters altogether.</p><p>The administration may also use the threat of criminal prosecution to pressure election officials to comply with unreasonable or unlawful requests. It may already be engaging in similar quid pro quo arrangements, as evidenced when the DOJ dropped corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams in the spring of 2025. Though the court ultimately ordered the case dismissed <em>with</em> prejudice (i.e., barring a future claim on the same facts), the DOJ had sought dismissal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/02/g-s1-57386/judge-new-york-eric-adams"><em>without</em> prejudice</a>, which would have left open the opportunity for the case to be refiled at a later time, and thus would have allowed the DOJ to hold the threat of prosecution over Adams should he not acquiesce to any requests the administration may make. The U.S. attorney responsible for the prosecution, who had been appointed by the president, resigned in protest,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25527077-acting-us-attorney-danielle-sassoons-resignation-letter/?q=baffled&amp;mode=document">alleging&nbsp;</a>that the decision was motivated by a desire to procure political cooperation from Adams on unrelated matters.</p><p>An election official fearful of criminal charges might succumb to pressure to aggressively purge voters from the rolls or to engage in outright election subversion. When the president tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election, he and his associates put pressure on state and local election officials — including, famously, in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/fact-check-trumps-georgia-call-raffensperger">phone call</a> to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — to assist his efforts. Raffensperger and other officials refused to subvert the results, but an election official facing the prospect of prosecution now might not take the same principled stand.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Wrong:</strong> Threats of criminal charges based on lies about the 2020 election have no legal or factual basis. There is no evidence that the 2020 election was tainted by any kind of fraud or impropriety in election administration. Project 2025 proposes to use a law designed to protect civil rights, including the right to vote, to prosecute state officials for aiding in the exercise of that right, a legal theory that will likely struggle in court.</p><p>The First Amendment protects election officials and pro-voter groups from retaliation based on their speech and association, just as it protects the speech and association of law firms. If the administration targets officials or groups for publicly declaring elections to be legitimate, safe, and secure or for registering and engaging voters, the targets may be able to block any investigation or prosecution in court before it proceeds, just as those law firms have succeeded in blocking the executive orders leveled at them.</p><p>Moreover, <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/guide-laws-against-intimidation-voters-and-election-workers">federal and state law prohibits anyone</a>, including federal officials, from intimidating voters and those, like election officials or civic engagement organizations, who assist or encourage them to vote. And though voters rarely do so, they&nbsp;<a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/821/1484/255574/">are able</a> to sue DOJ officials under anti-intimidation law in federal court.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> Thus far these threats have remained just that. For example, DOJ lawyers tasked with finding ways to prosecute election officials for allegedly failing to maintain proper cybersecurity are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/us/politics/justice-department-election-data.html#:~:text=Inside%20the%20Justice%20Department%2C%20a%20number%20of%20lawyers%20have%20struggled%20to%20find%20a%20criminal%20statute%20to%20match%20the%20Trump%20administration%E2%80%99s%20demands%2C%20according%20to%20the%20people%20familiar%20with%20the%20matter.">reportedly</a> struggling to find any criminal statute that will allow them to do so.&nbsp;</p>

                                          <p>The federal government has rewarded people who peddle conspiracy theories about voter fraud and continue to deny the legitimacy of the 2020 election, including by resorting to violence. Many of this administration’s political appointees have continuously challenged the results of the 2020 election or otherwise undermined elections.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/election-deniers-head-america-first-policy-institutes-new-state-chapters/#:~:text=Rep.%20Doug%20Collins%2C%20a%20longtime%20Trump%20ally%20and%20one%20of%20the%20126%20GOP%20House%20members%20who%20signed%20an%20amicus%20brief%20in%20the%20dismissed%20Supreme%20Court%20lawsuit%20that%20contested%20the%202020%20presidential%20election%20results">At</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-york-governors-debate-hochul-zeldin/#:~:text=Zeldin%20was%20one%20of%20147%20House%20Republicans%20who%20objected%20to%20certifying%20President%20Biden%27s%20electoral%20victory%20on%20Jan.%206%2C%202021%2C%20shortly%20after%20the%20Capitol%20building%20was%20attacked%20by%20Trump%27s%20supporters.">least</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/trump-is-still-trying-to-undermine-elections#:~:text=Now%20that%20Trump%20has%20installed%20a%20surfeit%20of%20election%20deniers,guardrails%20protecting%20voting%20and%20voters.">four</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5112100-trump-budget-nominee-russell-vought-2020-election/">members</a> of the president’s cabinet are election deniers.</p><h3>Pardoning January 6 Rioters</h3><p>The January 6 rioters&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/trumps-plan-rewrite-history-jan-6">violently attacked</a> the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to keep President Trump in office after he lost the 2020 presidential election. On the first day of his second term, the president pardoned approximately&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/g-s1-36809/trump-pardons-january-6-riot">1,500 individuals</a> who had been on trial and commuted the sentences of 14 people who had been convicted for their participation in that attack.</p><p><strong>Impact:</strong> The move green-lights future vigilante efforts to overturn elections, including efforts by the January 6 rioters themselves, by indicating that those who engage in political violence and interfere with the peaceful transfer of power may not only avoid legal consequences but also be treated as heroes. The president and others have cast the rioters as “<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4713140-trump-calls-j6-defendants-warriors/">warriors</a>” and “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y7l47xrpko#:~:text=Trump%20previously%20called%20those%20prosecuted%20for%20the%20riot%20%22political%20prisoners%22%2C%20who%20posed%20%22zero%20threat%22.">political prisoners</a>.”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/jan-6-rioters-are-the-new-hot-event-in-town-for-republicans-e3a02170">Republican Party events</a> around the country have honored the rioters.

While the events of January 6, 2021, took place in Washington, DC, under federal jurisdiction, similar acts anywhere else in the country would be governed by state laws, which prohibit violence, insurrection, and intimidation of voters and election officials.</p><p>Indeed, in part as a response to recent instances or threats of political violence, several states have strengthened such laws. For example, since 2020,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/chart-state-prohibitions-guns-election-locations">13 states&nbsp;</a>have passed laws banning guns or expanding prohibitions against them in and around polling places or ballot drop boxes. In addition, local election officials have partnered with law enforcement to form the&nbsp;<a href="https://safeelections.org/">Committee for Safe and Secure Elections</a> to protect voters and election workers from violence, threats, and intimidation. While the president is sending the message that his administration will reward those who undermine elections, states and local leaders are taking such threats seriously and have shored up the safety and security of elections.</p><h3>Undermining Prosecution of Election Subversion</h3><p>In 2021 Tina Peters, a Colorado election clerk, gave a man unauthorized access to voting equipment; that man was affiliated with My Pillow chief executive Mike Lindell, a leading proponent of false conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was rigged. She was convicted of four felonies under state law and sentenced to nine years in prison. The Trump administration is trying to get her out. In March 2025, the DOJ&nbsp;<a href="https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/03/gov.uscourts.cod_.241206.16.0.pdf">filed a statement of interest</a> in support of her habeas corpus petition, a federal suit seeking her release from prison while she pursues an appeal. The filing states that the DOJ is evaluating whether the state prosecution,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cpr.org/2024/09/11/interview-district-attorney-dan-rubinstein-tina-peters-case/#:~:text=Your%20office%20had%20to%20prosecute%20a%20fellow%20elected%20official%2C%20someone%20who%20is%20a%20Republican%20like%20yourself%20and%20on%20an%20issue%20%E2%80%94%20election%20conspiracies">led by an elected Republican prosecutor</a>, was politically motivated. On May 5, the federal court hearing Peters’s habeas petition&nbsp;<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69629270/47/peters-v-feyen/">held</a> that a number of her claims were premature and suggested that it might dismiss her entire case. On the same day, the president&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/05/05/trump-directs-department-of-justice-to-try-to-free-tina-peters-from-prison-in-social-media-post/">took to social media</a> to describe Peters as an “innocent Political Prisoner” and to direct the Justice Department to “take all necessary action to help secure” her release.</p><p><strong>Impact:</strong> These actions could embolden rogue election officials to threaten elections from within. The president and the DOJ are sending a clear message that they will support such officials when they engage in subversive behavior. By announcing a review of a state prosecution, the DOJ is also indicating to state prosecutors that bringing charges against election officials who support Trump’s attempts at election subversion will subject them to scrutiny.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Wrong:</strong> Neither the president nor the DOJ has the power to overturn a state conviction. Peters broke multiple state laws in support of a conspiracy theory. A jury found her guilty. President Trump undermines that finding by publicly declaring that Peters is innocent.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> Despite such threats, state officials continue to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/03/03/u-s-department-of-justice-to-review-state-conviction-of-former-mesa-county-clerk-tina-peters/">stand by</a> their prosecution of Peters in court and in the media, and Peters continues to serve her sentence.&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Scaling Back from Protecting Elections</h2>
        </header>
                                          <p>The Trump administration is retreating from its responsibility to protect U.S. elections. State and local election officials no longer have a reliable partner in the federal government. And voters should not expect to have their voting rights vindicated by the DOJ.&nbsp;</p><h3>Dismantling CISA</h3><p>CISA is a component of the DHS responsible for helping to protect the cybersecurity and physical security of the nation’s critical infrastructure, including election systems. The agency provides voluntary, low-cost, and no-cost services, training, and assessments for state and local election officials across the country and helps these officials better understand the security threats their systems face.</p><p>The Trump administration&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-federal-government-undermining-election-security">severely undermined</a> the structure and purpose of CISA in the president’s first few months in office. In February 2025, CISA&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-security-cisa-kristi-noem-cybersecurity-5bac8ce416c46b4fbe44c94ae5874b39">put 17 of its election security staff on administrative leave</a>. Additionally, DOGE&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/careers/fired-cisa-probationary-employees-to-be-reinstated-after-us-judges-order/ar-AA1B6u2E?ocid=BingNewsSerp">fired 130 people</a> from CISA; a judge later reinstated those employees to their positions, but they were immediately placed on administrative leave.</p><p>That same month, CISA&nbsp;paused all election security activities pending an internal review. The review was completed in March, but the Trump administration has refused to release the findings. It is unclear which CISA services have been restored, if any, despite&nbsp;<a href="https://www.padilla.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/04.17.25-Padilla-Morelle-CISA-April-2025-Follow-Up-Letter-FINAL6.pdf">repeated</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.padilla.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025.07.07-CISA-Letter_Morelle-Padilla.pdf">requests</a> for information from members of Congress responsible for agency oversight.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cisa-job-cuts/745483/">Reporting</a> from April suggests that CISA is planning massive additional cuts.</p><p>In March 2025, CISA&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-security-cisa-trump-kristi-noem-6c437543f5d26d890704e5f2a8400502">cut about $10 million</a> in funding to the Center for Internet Security, a nonprofit with programs that benefit state and local election officials. As a result, funding was eliminated for the&nbsp;<a href="https://statescoop.com/federal-cuts-election-security-secretaries-state-2025/">Election Infrastructure Information Analysis Center</a>, a network that facilitates information sharing about security risks and best practices between election vendors and state and local election officials, and was reduced for the&nbsp;<a href="https://statescoop.com/ms-isac-loses-federal-support/">Multi-State Information and Analysis Center</a>, a similar network that serves all state and local government entities.</p><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Scaling back the expertise at CISA and cutting the critical funding it delivers to state and local officials for election security expose U.S. election infrastructure to cyberattacks and physical attacks, leaving election officials with less support to anticipate or recover from these attacks and to run safe and secure elections.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Wrong:</strong> CISA’s dismantling occurs at a time when there are aggressive threats to our election system from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/state-agenda-election-security-and-resiliency">foreign and domestic actors</a>. Cyberattacks may also become more effective with the evolution of artificial intelligence.</p><p>Additionally, a federal judge found that the firing of CISA employees was illegal under the Administrative Procedure Act for failure to follow federal law and regulations. The employees were reinstated. Despite the ruling, however, CISA managed to accomplish the same outcome, a diminished workforce, by immediately placing those reinstated employees on administrative leave.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/state-agenda-election-security-and-resiliency">In the absence of federal assistance</a>, state and local officials can set up new interagency working groups on election security — initiatives that states have taken in past election cycles — as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://statescoop.com/north-dakota-interstate-cyber-operations-center-expands-10-states/">expand interstate information-sharing networks</a>. States can also pass and enforce laws to protect election workers and infrastructure.</p><h3>Directing the DOJ to Endanger Voting Rights Rather Than Protect Them&nbsp;</h3><p>Shortly after being appointed to run the DOJ’s civil rights division, Assistant Attorney General Dhillon announced and implemented a “<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/doj-leader-calls-for-civil-rights-paradigm-shift-after-exodus">paradigm shift</a>” that shirks the department’s responsibility to protect voting rights. While Dhillon describes the “usual approach” of previous Republican administrations as working to “slow the train down,” she envisions the division “turning the train around and driving in the opposite direction” under her leadership. Shortly after taking the helm, she also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/18/justice-department-civil-rights-division-trump">issued new mission statements</a> that signal the division’s move away from protecting the rights of marginalized groups and toward efforts such as rooting out voter fraud, which is actually extremely rare. Project 2025 had proposed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/project-2025s-anti-voter-agenda">such a shift</a>, also reflected in the president’s executive order on elections.</p><blockquote><p>“The Trump administration has signaled that it is unlikely to enforce laws to protect voting rights.”</p></blockquote><p>The DOJ has since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/28/trump-doj-voting-rights">dropped every voting case</a> in which it had been a plaintiff at the start of this administration, and it has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/justice-department-shirking-its-responsibility-voters">withdrawn its involvement</a> in several other voting and redistricting suits. It also gutted the civil rights division of its career staff. By the end of May 2025, an estimated 250 attorneys making up approximately&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/g-s1-66906/trump-civil-rights-justice-exodus">70 percent of the division’s lawyers</a> had left the department. The staff of the division’s voting section&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/04/politics/inside-gutting-justice-department-voting-section">dwindled</a> from approximately 30 lawyers down to about 6. But the division has begun hiring new attorneys. The voting section is now led by Maureen Riordan, a longtime DOJ lawyer who rejoined the department after a stint at the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF), a conservative organization that has for years sued election officials to try to force aggressive purges of the voter rolls.</p><p>Under Riordan, the DOJ sued election administrators in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1401636/dl">North Carolina</a>&nbsp;in an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/court-cases/united-states-v-north-carolina-state-board-elections">apparent attempt</a> to prompt a purge of thousands of eligible voters from the rolls. The department also sued an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1404546/dl">Orange County, California</a>, election official for failing to provide the department unredacted private information concerning voters he had removed from the rolls; the official had previously provided redacted records to ensure voter privacy, but the department did not agree with the redaction. The DOJ also filed statements of interest in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1402891/dl?inline">Oregon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1407251/dl">Illinois</a>&nbsp;in support of another conservative activist organization’s lawsuits seeking more aggressive voter roll purges. And it issued letters to state election administrators in at least six other states —<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/16/trump-voter-fraud-elections/">Alaska</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25964785-hava-letter-redacted/">Arizona</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5426097/trump-justice-department-voter-data-colorado">Colorado</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/State-of-Minnesota.pdf">Minnesota</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25994295-doj-62325-letter-to-commonwealth-of-pennsylvania/">Pennsylvania</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1402606/dl?inline">Wisconsin</a>&nbsp;— identifying purported failures to satisfy federal laws governing voter list maintenance.</p><p><strong>Impact:</strong> The Trump administration has signaled that it is unlikely to enforce laws to protect voting rights. That leaves voters particularly vulnerable in the seven states in the middle of the country that make up the Eighth Circuit, where the court of appeals&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/appeals-court-strips-voters-ability-file-voting-rights-act-lawsuits-7">recently ruled</a> that only the DOJ can bring suits to enforce the Voting Rights Act’s central prohibition against discrimination against racial and language minorities. The ruling bars private plaintiffs such as voters and advocacy groups, who have historically brought&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/importance-letting-voters-defend-their-rights-court">the vast majority</a> of these cases, from filing suit. Unless the Supreme Court overturns that ruling, voters in these seven states (Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota) will essentially be left without the primary protections of the landmark civil rights law.</p><p>At the same time, the department’s new focus on litigation to press for more aggressive purges poses a threat to election administration and voters alike. Aggressive purges risk disenfranchising eligible voters, as evidenced by the department’s suit in North Carolina. As many as 200,000 North Carolina voter registration records are missing a driver’s license number or the last four digits of a Social Security number, a result of the state voter registration form’s poor design and likely mistakes in data management. These are errors by the state, not the voters themselves; moreover, the omission of these numbers from voter records indicates nothing about the eligibility of these people to vote. But the DOJ’s suit against North Carolina purportedly aimed at fixing the state’s mistakes asks for relief that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/north-carolinians-go-court-protect-their-right-vote">would result</a> in the removal of many of these voters from the rolls.</p><p>PILF and other groups have tried to force voter roll purges through lawsuits, and they have been unsuccessful in court&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/league-women-voters-files-intervene-voter-purge-suit-against-state#:~:text=Over%20the%20last%20four%20years%2C%20Michigan%E2%80%99s%20voter%20rolls%20have%20been%20subject%20to%20similar%20lawsuits%2C%20such%20as%C2%A0Daunt%20v.%20Benson%2C%C2%A0PILF%20v.%20Winfrey%2C%20and%C2%A0PILF%20v.%20Benson%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20all%20of%20which%20failed.">time and again</a>. That is because while federal law requires election officials to conduct “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/20507#:~:text=that%20makes%20a-,reasonable%20effort,-to%20remove%20the">reasonable</a>” voter list maintenance, it does not mandate a particular program for removing voters, nor does it require the removal of voters for mistakes in their records that are no fault of their own and indicate nothing about their eligibility.</p><p>Successful or not, these suits also feed a false narrative that U.S. elections are rife with fraud and provide fodder for attempts at overturning results. The DOJ’s suit in North Carolina follows a&nbsp;<a href="https://statecourtreport.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/griffin-concedes-riggs-ending-six-month-dispute-over-north-carolina?_gl=1*1cy8gzm*_gcl_au*ODg1ODIyNjQzLjE3NTE5OTc2MzU">months-long attempt</a> by a losing North Carolina Supreme Court candidate to reverse his defeat by using the same missing information in the state’s rolls to justify throwing out the validly cast votes of tens of thousands of eligible voters. The DOJ’s pursuit of cases like this one could lend legitimacy to similar election subversion efforts in the future.</p><p>Such suits also could provide cover for election officials to take bad-faith actions that would disenfranchise voters.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/">Dozens of election officials</a> around the country are themselves election deniers. They could use a suit by the DOJ as justification for purging thousands of voters from the rolls or applying a fringe legal interpretation to a federal law.</p><p><strong>Why It’s Wrong:</strong> The DOJ has&nbsp;<a href="https://perma.cc/RXR2-GLK6">statutory duties</a> to enforce federal laws that ensure greater access to the ballot box for all eligible Americans, including duties set out in the Civil Rights Acts, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Voting Accessibility for Elderly and Handicapped Act of 1984, the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, and the Help America Vote Act of 2002.</p><p><strong>Status:</strong> The administration is still bound by the Constitution and the law. The abovementioned laws remain in full effect, and, despite the Eighth Circuit’s rogue ruling concerning the Voting Rights Act, many of them allow private enforcement through suits by voters and advocates. Private plaintiffs can and should bring legal challenges under federal law. Additionally, none of the new cases filed by the DOJ’s voting section have advanced to a decision in the courts, but organizations like the Brennan Center are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/north-carolinians-go-court-protect-their-right-vote">seeking to intervene</a> where appropriate to ensure that, when the courts do rule, voters’ interests are represented.</p>

        </header>
                                          <p>The Constitution establishes a system of checks and balances to ensure free and fair elections. The power to regulate elections lies in the hands of states and Congress. Courts and advocates complement this system to uphold the Constitution and federal law.</p><p>U.S. election infrastructure leaves no room for the president to insert himself. Yet that is exactly what he purports to do now: directing, dismantling, and weaponizing agencies so that the Trump administration can evade its responsibility to ensure the security of elections and the freedom to vote. Instead, the administration is setting the stage for election subversion. This power play poses a grave threat to the future of U.S. election infrastructure. It is also, in many respects, illegal. The various institutions and actors that operate the constitutional checks and balances safeguarding U.S. elections — including the courts, Congress, independent federal agencies, state legislatures, state and local election officials, and the people themselves — must prevent the Trump administration’s power grab from succeeding.&nbsp;</p>

		<h2>Overview </h2>
<p>Low-cost micro-units, often called single-room occupancies, or SROs, were once a reliable form of housing for the United States’ poorest residents of, and newcomers to, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and many other major U.S. cities. Well into the 20th century, SROs were the least expensive option on the housing market, providing a small room with a shared bathroom and sometimes a shared kitchen for a price that is unimaginable today—as little as $100 to $300 a month (in 2025 dollars). </p>
<p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, landlords converted thousands of houses, hotels, apartment buildings, and commercial buildings into SROs, and by 1950, SRO units made up about 10% of all rental units in some major cities. But beginning in the mid-1950s, as some politicians and vocal members of the public turned against SROs and the people who lived in them, major cities across the country revised zoning and building codes to force or encourage landlords to eliminate SRO units and to prohibit the development of new ones. Over the next several decades, governments and developers gradually demolished thousands of SROs or converted them to other uses, including boutique hotels for tourists. And as SROs disappeared, homelessness—which had been rare from at least the end of the Great Depression to the late 1970s—exploded nationwide.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now, as a nationwide housing shortage has pushed rents and homelessness to historic highs, some states and localities are reconsidering the value of lower-cost, small units with shared kitchens, bathrooms, and amenities. Ironically, had SROs grown since 1960 at about the same rate as the rest of the U.S. housing stock, the nation would have roughly 2.5 million more such units— enough to house every American experiencing homelessness in a recent federal count more than three times over. </p>

<p>As governments throughout the United States seek to fill the gap in low-cost housing, one promising and inexpensive model is gaining traction: making shared housing legal, as it was for most of U.S. history. And one version of shared housing—converting some of the vast supply of office space left empty since the COVID-19 pandemic—looks especially promising: A single office building conversion could add hundreds of low-cost homes near jobs and transit, while a large high-rise could add more than 1,000 homes. Several states have passed laws in the last few years to remove local legal barriers to building SROs or converting certain existing buildings into SROs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This brief explores the history of SROs and their close relationship with homelessness. It also looks at strategies for adding large quantities of inexpensive housing units to meet the needs of the nation’s most vulnerable residents as well as others seeking low-cost housing. </p>
<h2>Housing costs drive homelessness&nbsp; </h2>
<p>A wealth of research has examined the causes of homelessness over the past two decades. These studies consistently find that the cost of housing is by far the primary driver. For example, several studies have concluded that an area’s median rent correlates far more closely with its homelessness rate than factors such as weather, poverty rate, and rates of mental illness or substance use.&nbsp; </p>
<p>One study found that a $100 increase in median rent was associated with a 9% increase in homelessness.<sup>1</sup> Another found that as rent-to-income ratios increase, homelessness increases in tandem.<sup>2</sup> A separate study found a strong relationship between home prices and homelessness.<sup>3</sup> Several studies have found low rental vacancy rates strongly predict high levels of homelessness.<sup>4</sup> And when rents are high, families squeeze more people into smaller spaces, with less room to help struggling friends and relatives.<sup>5</sup> Salim Furth, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, explains the link: “When housing is cheap, relatives and friends tend to have more space in their homes, enabling them to keep someone at risk of homelessness off the street. … When space is tight, the people forced out are those who are hardest to live with.”<sup>6</sup> Frequent explanations for homelessness focus on an individual’s characteristics. Certainly, people experiencing homelessness have disproportionate rates of disabilities, mental illness, and substance use compared with the general population. But cities with an abundance of low-cost homes have far less homelessness than high-cost cities, despite having similar rates of disability, mental illness, and substance abuse.<sup>7</sup> And, as noted earlier, even in New York, San Francisco, and other expensive places, homelessness was uncommon as recently as the 1970s, when those cities still had a large stock of SROs. </p>
<p>This relationship is apparent whether comparing cities or states.<sup>8</sup> High-rent states such as California, Hawaii, and New York have persistently high rates of homelessness; states with low rents, such as Alabama, Mississippi, and West Virginia, have low rates.<sup>9</sup> California’s rate of homelessness is more than 10 times Mississippi’s. The rate of homelessness in New York City and San Francisco is about 15 times that of Houston, which has the lowest rents among the largest U.S. cities. Memphis, Tennessee; Milwaukee; and Pittsburgh are three other cities that have rents lower than most U.S. cities; all have consistently maintained lower-than-average rates of homelessness.<sup>10</sup> Nationwide, as rents rose, 2023 marked an all-time high in homelessness. That mark was eclipsed in 2024. </p>
<p>We can be sure that high housing costs are causing high homelessness because as housing costs change in a city or state, homelessness tends to move in tandem. When rents rise quickly, homelessness does too; when rents rise slowly but incomes keep increasing, that improves affordability, so homelessness declines. Supply and demand are the primary drivers of rent: When jurisdictions have added more housing, rent growth has slowed and homelessness has fallen.<sup>11</sup> Where housing supply is limited, rent growth has been faster and homelessness more severe. </p>

<p>Another key indicator of the overwhelming relationship between housing costs and homelessness is the limited effectiveness of interventions targeted at other perceived causes of homelessness. An approach known as Housing First, for instance, showed great promise in the early 2000s. Previous attempts to address homelessness typically required individuals to participate in programs—drug treatment is a prominent example—before they received permanent housing. Housing First provided homeless individuals with a home along with access to social services such as counseling or treatment. The administrations of both George W. Bush and Barack Obama strongly supported Housing First, as did many states and cities. People receiving help via the Housing First strategy were far more likely to gain and keep a home than those that received conventional services.<sup>12</sup> But when the 2007-09 Great Recession hit, homebuilding across the United States collapsed. The rate of homebuilding stayed low for the next decade and has never fully recovered. The resulting housing shortage drove rents higher—and with them, homelessness—despite the continued use of Housing First.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contrasting experience of two large Texas cities demonstrates this phenomenon clearly. Houston’s permissive homebuilding laws enabled it to increase its housing supply and hold rents low. By contrast, Dallas added much less new housing than Houston and saw much faster rent growth. Both cities used Housing First to help tackle homelessness, but while Houston’s homelessness rate fell—the city’s rate is just a fifth of the U.S. overall and by far the lowest among large cities—Dallas’ homelessness rate increased.<sup>13</sup> </p>

<p>Raleigh, North Carolina, provides another example of the link between high rents and homelessness. Median rents there jumped 34% from 2017 to 2022, and homelessness rose 62%.<sup>14</sup> But Raleigh enacted reforms that made it easier to build homes, including town houses, accessory dwelling units, and two- and three-unit buildings.<sup>15</sup> Rents didn’t rise at all in Raleigh from the start of 2022 to the start of 2024, and homelessness fell 35%.<sup>16</sup> Austin, Texas, had a similar experience, with rents and homelessness soaring from 2017 to 2022, but after land-use reforms made it easier to add housing, Austin saw both rents and homelessness decline.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extensive research has shown that adding housing supply, as Houston has done, slows rent growth, improving affordability. The main mechanism for this is that as new housing is added, there is less competition for older housing, which becomes more affordable. New housing helps improve affordability immediately, increasing supply and reducing demand pressure on the rest of the housing stock. In this way, more construction of new housing helps ensure a steady supply of lower-cost housing to accommodate lower-income residents. For example, when individual markets such as Austin and Phoenix saw a large number of new apartments delivered in 2023 (mainly projects that had started when interest rates were very low a couple of years earlier), rents declined across the board.<sup>18</sup> But they fell most in older apartments with few amenities.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>SROs and homelessness—an intertwined history </h2>
<h3>A new era gives rise to a new housing model </h3>
<p>Homelessness first became an issue on a national scale in the 1870s. Continued upheaval in the aftermath of the Civil War and industrialization pushed more people into “riding the rails” on the nation’s new railroad system in search of jobs.<sup>19</sup> The rise of these itinerant workers, in turn, drove the development of early rooming houses and residential hotels, particularly for Americans at the lower end of the income scale. Rooms could be rented by the night, week, or month. </p>

<p>Rooming and lodging houses were the first examples of SRO housing in the United States. Often, they were converted from single-family houses, tenement apartment buildings, or commercial office and warehouse properties. In other cases, single-family homes were not converted, but owners rented out individual rooms. American Enterprise Institute researchers have noted that before the 1920s, about one-third to one-half of urban residents were either boarders or rented part of their home to boarders.<sup>20</sup> However, hotels designed to serve medium- and long-term tenants also began appearing in U.S. cities: Residential hotels became the most common SRO model throughout the country. Some residential hotels offered meal service in luxurious dining rooms, as well as regular laundry and maid service; less expensive hotels featured dark rooms without windows or even just a dry space on an open floor in a flophouse for 5 cents to 10 cents a night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Residential hotel construction peaked in the early 20th century in most cities. By the 1920s, many cheap hotels in big cities such as New York, San Francisco, and Chicago offered a mix of private rooms; large rooms converted to tiny, cubicle-style bedrooms with partitions that did not reach the ceilings; and open-air wards with rows of cots.<sup>21</sup> At the time, a private room might rent for 25 cents to 40 cents a night and the semiprivate cubicles and open wards for 15 cents to 25 cents a night. That’s far less than anything available in modern U.S. cities: 40 cents in 1924 is the equivalent of about $7.40 in 2025, roughly $230 a month. That would be affordable even to a person living below the federal poverty line (defined as $15,650 in income for a one-person household in 2025).&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hotels nationwide were much different than they are today. They were much more likely to host long-term occupants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One 1930 survey of hotels throughout the country found that long-term residents occupied an average of 20% of the rooms in the most expensive third of American hotels, and at least 75% of rooms in low- and mid-priced hotels.<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>In New York City, low-rent, single-room occupancy exploded during the Great Depression and World War II, when tens of thousands of people moved from the South and Puerto Rico to work in the city’s munitions factories and on major construction projects. By the 1950s, the city had more than 200,000 SRO units, accounting for more than 10% of the city’s rental housing stock.<sup>23</sup> In 1986, 87,000 New Yorkers still lived in hotels, according to what was then the largest study of inexpensive hotels undertaken by a city government in the U.S. Across the five boroughs, 43% of SRO residents were under 40 years old and 32% were 40 to 60 years old; a third were Black; and a quarter were Latino.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the same era in San Francisco, many long-term occupants of residential hotels were retired Filipino or Chinese laborers or newly arrived families from Southeast Asia.<sup>24</sup> In 1977, 330 sheriff’s deputies and policemen showed up to evict 40 elderly Filipino and Chinese residents from the International Hotel, triggering outcry and concern as well as a congressional report.<sup>25</sup> </p>
<h3>A backlash against SROs causes an explosion of homelessness </h3>
<p>Even as SRO hotels and rooming houses provided homes for many of the poorest U.S. residents, problems arose. The housing was often of low quality and poorly maintained, and some neighbors complained about SRO residents. </p>
<p>Some politicians scapegoated SRO residents, increasingly portraying them as poor, dependent on alcohol or drugs, reliant on public welfare, transient, and immoral.<sup>26</sup> This image was compounded by the condition of many SRO buildings, which even in the early 1900s were often run-down and neglected. Reformers blamed crowded apartments and unsanitary shared bathroom facilities for the spread of common diseases like pneumonia and tuberculosis.<sup>27</sup> Some policymakers and activists viewed residential hotels and SROs as a public nuisance and a decaying form of housing that should be eliminated. “The SRO should not be accepted as lawful housing for any segment of our population,” an aide to New York City Mayor Robert F. Wagner reportedly said in 1965.<sup>28</sup> “ No community should equate such housing with the acceptable living standards of the 1960s.” </p>
<p>Many city and state governments began crafting policies in the 1950s and 1960s that encouraged property owners to convert SRO buildings to tourist-oriented hotels or traditional apartments. Newly enacted zoning codes and building codes made creating SROs illegal or economically unviable. Researchers have noted that market forces alone would have been unlikely to decimate the stock of SROs because they were profitable to operate when allowed and declined only when new laws targeted them. </p>
<p>The scale of the loss of low-cost housing in the second half of the 20th century is staggering. There is no reliable count of the number of SRO units lost before 1970; “estimates usually refer to ‘millions’ of rooms closed, converted, or torn down in major U.S. cities,” the historian Paul Groth said.<sup>29</sup> He estimates that another million residential hotel rooms were destroyed or converted in the subsequent decade, from 1970 to 1980.<sup>30</sup> Almost all of that housing was destroyed or converted to other uses in response to zoning and building code reforms or tax incentives enacted for the specific purpose of eliminating SROs.</p>
<p>New York City, for example, banned construction of SRO buildings and the creation of new SRO units from existing buildings in 1955. Over the next two decades, the city enacted a series of other building code and zoning changes, which raised the costs of operating SRO buildings and had the effect of encouraging owners to convert them to other uses.<sup>31</sup> This meant that apartments in a building were required to have an average size much larger than SROs, in addition to the ban on new SROs. In the 1970s, New York City enacted tax abatements that gave SRO owners a financial incentive to convert SROs into rent-stabilized apartments with bathrooms and kitchens included (and higher rents). The tax break worked as intended, driving the conversion of 40 residential hotels a year.<sup>32</sup> In response to the city and state incentives and regulatory changes, owners destroyed two-thirds of New York City’s remaining SRO units from 1976 to 1981, a state Assembly study found at the time.<sup>33 </sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New York City was not alone. Starting in the 1960s, for example, San Francisco decided to redevelop South of Market, making way for what became the Moscone Convention Center and Yerba Buena Gardens—an area where 41% of the 240 resident families lived in hotels. Justin Herman, who led the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency from 1959 to 1971 and accelerated its urban renewal efforts throughout the city, was quoted as saying, “This land is too valuable to permit poor people to park on it.”<sup>34</sup> Studies estimate that 40,000 residential hotel rooms were destroyed by urban renewal programs in San Francisco—including more than 6,000 in just five years from 1975 to 1980—though the city did not maintain public records on the total.<sup>35</sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Similarly, Seattle demolished half of its SROs downtown—16,200 units—between 1960 and 1973.<sup>36</sup> A catastrophic fire at the five-story Ozark Hotel in March 1970 led to a wave of demolition. After the fire, Seattle changed its building code to require either sprinklers or fire-resistant doors and stairways for buildings where residents lived on the fourth story or higher. These costly upgrades made it challenging to operate inexpensive units. The city demolished 5,000 SRO units during its enforcement of this one code change—the so-called Ozark fire code—in the 1970s.<sup>37</sup> Several other building code mandates followed, prompting many residential hotel owners to abandon their buildings rather than incur the higher costs to maintain them; by 1982, nearly 30% of the remaining units in downtown Seattle sat vacant.<sup>38</sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Other notable examples include Boston, which lost nearly 90% of its SROs from the 1950s to 1985;<sup> </sup>&nbsp;Chicago, which lost 80% of its SRO units—32,000 rooms—between 1973 and 1984; and San Diego, which lost about 1,247 units from 1976 to 1984.<sup>39</sup> Cincinnati is estimated to have lost more than 2,000 units during the 1970s, about 42% of its SRO stock.<sup>40</sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p>As the nation’s least expensive source of housing disappeared, homelessness soared in major cities across the United States. In New York City, for example,<em> </em>the number of homeless residents increased from a barely visible population to almost 30,000 by 1987.<sup>41</sup> About half of men entering homeless shelters in the city in 1980 reported they had previously lived in SROs. The sudden loss of SROs and commensurate rise in homelessness prompted an advocate in New York to remark: “The people you see sleeping under bridges used to be valued members of the housing market … they aren’t anymore.”&nbsp; </p>

<p>A series of social, political, and economic changes also battered large U.S. cities in the 1980s, contributing to the homelessness epidemic. State psychiatric hospitals released people suffering from mental illness without adequate provisions for outpatient care. Property owners abandoned inner cities, leaving empty buildings. AIDS arrived. The federal government reduced subsidies for public housing and rental assistance and made it more difficult for people with disabilities to qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Cuts to SSI—which largely benefits disabled people and those over 65—and a tightening of eligibility for disability payments in the early 1980s added to the financial instability of many struggling Americans.<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some regions, especially the Northeast, homelessness became less visible after the initial surge in the early 1980s, as cities and towns increased shelter capacity. As a result, a larger share of people experience sheltered rather than unsheltered homelessness in cold-weather cities, especially in the Northeast. But the life outcomes of people without homes who live in shelters are little better than for those without homes who live on the street. Both groups lose decades of life expectancy.<sup>43</sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p>By the 1990s, only a tiny fraction of SRO hotels were left in the United States. Housing costs were lower in the 1990s than today (even in income-adjusted terms), but the lack of SROs meant that homelessness continued unabated. With the lowest rung on the housing ladder missing, many people could not afford rent for conventional apartments or houses, including shared ones.<sup>44</sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Nationwide, homelessness has been rising since 2017 as housing has become increasingly more expensive. Between 2022 and 2023 alone, the number of homeless people in the U.S. rose by 12%, to more than 653,000, according to the annual count compiled by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).<sup>45</sup> That meant 20 in 10,000 Americans were experiencing homelessness on a single night in January, the most since HUD began counting in 2007.<sup>46</sup> In 2024, the homelessness rate jumped to 23 in 10,000.<sup>47</sup> More than a third of all individuals identified in the HUD count were living on the street, in abandoned buildings, or beneath bridges—or, in the words of the HUD report, “in places not meant for human habitation.”<sup>48</sup> The 2023 record was broken in 2024, when HUD released data identifying 771,480 homeless Americans, an 18% increase from 2023. These numbers are widely considered an underestimate.&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h3>2.5 Million Missing Low-Cost Units </h3>
<p>In 1960, when the loss of SROs was just beginning, there were 6.9 million single-person households in the U.S. By 2023, that number had reached 38 million.<sup>49</sup> In that time, the nation’s housing stock grew by a factor of 2.5, from 58.3 million homes to 145.4 million. Meanwhile, more than 1 million SRO units were destroyed or converted to other uses from 1970 to 1980 alone. Had the SRO stock grown at a similar rate as the rest of the nation’s housing supply, the U.S. would have added 1.5 million units rather than losing 1 million, for a net change of 2.5 million more SRO units. That’s more than triple the number of people experiencing homelessness in HUD’s 2024 count.<sup>50</sup>  </p>

<p>New housing is usually expensive, and as homes get older, they get more affordable as high-income residents move into costly new housing. SROs, though, can be created at a much lower price point than other types of housing because the units are small and residents generally share bathrooms and kitchens. The same building using an SRO-style layout can simply fit more units that cost less than conventional apartments. Historically, SROs usually weren’t new construction; instead, they were created from other residential or commercial buildings whose original use no longer made sense. As the U.S. finds itself with more than a billion square feet of vacant office space in 2025, there is an opportunity to do what property owners did in the late 1800s and early 1900s: convert underused space into low-cost, well-located SRO-style housing units. It’s not possible to create all 2.5 million missing units this way, but SRO layouts are so efficient that a single high-rise building can hold more than 1,000 units.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h3>Full circle: Surging homelessness drives renewed interest in SROs&nbsp; </h3>
<p>As early as the mid-1980s, the problem of homelessness in New York City had gotten so severe that legislators tried to reverse course on SROs.<sup>51</sup> The city government passed Local Law 19 in May 1983, adding protections for SRO tenants. The city ended tax benefits for converting SROs in 1983.<sup>52</sup> Eventually, the City Council banned the conversion, alteration, demolition, or warehousing (holding units vacant for years to make them eligible for conversion or demolition) of SRO units altogether. But the New York Court of Appeals ruled these bans unconstitutional because they prevented property owners from determining how their buildings could be used.<sup>53</sup> Similarly, Chicago officials passed an SRO preservation ordinance to discourage conversions or sales of SROs in 2014, but by that time, the large majority had already been lost.<sup>54</sup> The city’s zoning and building codes made it challenging to build new ones.</p>
<p>Although New York City’s policy to block owners of SRO buildings from converting them to new uses was overturned by courts, city officials took other steps to preserve SROs even as different city laws banned the creation of new ones. One of these statutes was an anti-harassment policy instituted decades ago, which required that landlords looking to convert SROs prove that they had not harassed tenants to move out, such as by making living conditions intolerable or failing to perform needed maintenance. But this policy, known as a Certification of Non-Harassment (CONH), added costs and administrative requirements for landlords, contributing to the difficulty of operating SROs. The program was changed and expanded in 2018 to require that landlords also get a CONH before renovating SRO buildings.<sup>55</sup> Ultimately, however, neither the city nor the state has taken effective steps to rehabilitate or meaningfully expand the city’s SRO stock.<sup>56</sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Despite all of this, New York City probably still has the largest remaining stock of SRO hotels and rooming houses in the country. A paper from the Furman Center at New York University estimated that there were as many as 30,000 SRO units remaining in the city in 2014.<sup>57</sup> The city regulates SROs as part of its rent stabilization program, meaning owners can raise rents by only a low amount each year and need to file documentation with the city on each unit’s rent. In 2022, the state housing agency reported 322 regulated SRO buildings with 11,051 units, of which nearly half—more than 5,300—were rent-stabilized.<sup>58</sup> The median monthly allowable rent for these units was $1,018 in 2022, compared with $1,641 for a regular rental apartment in the city in 2023 (including public housing, rent-controlled housing, subsidized housing, and conventional, market-rate housing).<sup>59</sup>&nbsp; </p>

<p>Although New York has the most existing SROs, several Western states have been the first to pass new laws to enable construction of single-occupancy units. State governments have increasingly stepped in to require that certain types of housing be allowed because localities have not taken adequate steps to address the housing shortage.<sup>60</sup> That was rare in the past: From 2011 to 2016, all states combined passed an average of one law per year to allow more homes; from 2023 to 2024, that number jumped to 48 for all states combined. In 2024, the Washington Legislature passed legislation requiring cities to allow SRO-type housing wherever multifamily housing of six or more units is permitted, beginning in late 2025.<sup>61</sup> This legislation authorizes small units with shared bathrooms and kitchens; limits off-street parking requirements to one spot for every four bedrooms; and prohibits all parking mandates for buildings within half a mile of a major transit stop.<sup>62</sup> The bill was one of several that Washington passed to ensure that some types of lower-cost housing are allowed even where local governments had blocked them before or residents fought development.<sup>63</sup> Seattle had previously allowed development of low-cost micro-units, for example, but city officials in 2013 enacted laws that effectively prohibited them. </p>
<p>The Oregon Legislature enacted similar legislation in 2023, allowing micro-units in all areas zoned for residential use in cities across the state, including an SRO with up to six units on a parcel zoned for single-family use.<sup>64</sup> As of Jan.1, 2025, Hawaii communities must allow the conversion of commercial properties into SRO housing.<sup>65</sup> Montana took a somewhat different approach, passing legislation in 2023 that created a housing “menu” for its cities and towns to choose from—a series of options from which cities must choose at least five to allow more housing.<sup>66</sup> One of these is to permit co-living micro-units.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Perhaps the simplest method of creating low-cost shared housing is to allow unrelated individuals to share a house in the same way that relatives are allowed to share a house.<sup>67</sup> But many communities limit the number of unrelated people who can live together—in some places, to as few as two. Such laws make sharing a house for a group of roommates—which usually enables rents lower than having an individual apartment—illegal. The U.S. has a record number of unused bedrooms, but many cannot be rented because of restrictions on house sharing by unrelated roommates, even if that would be the most profitable use for the landlord and the most affordable option for the tenants.<sup>68</sup> To enable this low-cost housing option, Iowa, Oregon, and Colorado all passed bipartisan legislation to strike down local codes that prohibit house-sharing (in 2017, 2021, and 2024, respectively).<sup>69</sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In all of those cases, states have stepped in when localities did not act, authorizing lower-cost housing and limiting the ability of local governments to ban inexpensive housing. The aim of those laws is to increase the rental market for low- and moderate-income residents and make more use of existing housing stock. If these bills succeed, and a large number of micro-units reach market, their rents will likely be low, since individual rooms, when available, usually rent for far less than houses or apartments.<sup>70</sup> And while these units are intended for individuals rather than larger households, Manhattan Institute researchers have noted that they could “help release three- and four-bedroom apartments currently occupied by unrelated millennials” for use by families.<sup>71</sup> </p>

<p>Individual rooms also cost less to build than apartments and houses. In October 2024, February 2025, and April 2025, The Pew Charitable Trusts and Gensler, a global architecture, design, and planning firm, released three reports that described how vacant office space in large cities could be converted into low-cost micro-units with shared bathrooms and kitchens—essentially a safe, clean, code-compliant, well-located version of SROs.<sup>72</sup> The projected rents for rooms in these converted buildings are about half of the median in the studied markets and therefore affordable to residents earning 30% to 50% of the area median income, with much lower public subsidies than are generally required to build low-cost apartments.<sup>73</sup> The small unit size (120-220 square feet), shared bathrooms, and shared kitchens would lead to development costs at least 50% lower than the cost of building new studio apartments. If these modern SRO rooms were priced right, a wide range of residents might elect to live in conveniently located downtown housing. But this option could make the biggest difference for low-income residents who are now struggling to afford any type of home.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Many Americans are struggling. Nationwide, about 11 million tenant households—one-fourth of all renters in the U.S.—are considered extremely low-income, earning at or below the federal poverty line of $15,650 for a single person or $32,150 for a family of four or if they earn less than 30% of their area’s median income. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the United </p>
<p>States is short more than 7 million rental units that are affordable for those households.<sup>74</sup> California has the nation’s largest extremely low-income renter population, with nearly 1.3 million households.<sup>75</sup> And of those, more than three-quarters are severely “rent burdened,” meaning they spend more than 50% of their income on housing costs. New York has the second-highest number of extremely low-income renter households, at just under 1 million.<sup>76</sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p>New York State has taken fewer steps than some other states to house its poorest citizens. In 2023,Governor Kathy Hochul (D) announced $50 million in funding to help landlords repair 500 SROs across the state, a quiet reversal of long-standing anti-SRO policies.<sup>77</sup> And for the first time in decades, New York City has removed one of the barriers to new SRO units as part of a slate of zoning changes, called City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. City of Yes, which broadly aims to allow modestly more residential development throughout New York’s five boroughs, removed the minimum average unit-size requirements in Manhattan south of 96th Street and in downtown Brooklyn.<sup>78</sup> But New York City’s building code still has other obstacles to converting space into SRO-style housing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with these efforts to add low-cost housing and reduce homelessness, from 2022 to 2023, the U.S. added fewer than 37,000 beds specifically to help individuals transitioning out of homelessness, an increase of just 7%. Providing safe, affordable homes for the hundreds of thousands of Americans experiencing homelessness will require far more ambitious policy initiatives informed by a recognition of the vital role SROs have played in U.S. housing for a century and a half.</p>
<h2>Conclusion </h2>
<p>Housing costs are by far the strongest determinant of homelessness. Areas with high costs have high homelessness rates, and areas with low housing costs have low homelessness rates. When rents rise quickly, homelessness does, too. When rent growth is contained, homelessness drops. Increasing the housing supply helps hold rent growth down, making housing more affordable. But adding low-cost housing is especially helpful in preventing homelessness.&nbsp; </p>

<p>When SROs were widespread in the United States, even the nation’s poorest residents could usually afford a home. But as targeted zoning, building codes, and tax incentives led to the demise of the SRO housing stock, homelessness became commonplace. Had the country’s stock of SRO housing merely grown in line with other types of housing, the U.S. would have about 2.5 million additional low-cost homes—more than triple the number of people counted as homeless in January 2024.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In an effort to bring back low-cost housing, some states that are struggling with high homelessness rates have begun to remove legal barriers to the development of co-living buildings that feature private micro-units with shared bathrooms and kitchens. If more states and cities reduce regulatory barriers to this type of housing—and ideally provide incentives to kick-start its development—the nation has a real opportunity to once again make homelessness rare and ensure that the most financially vulnerable Americans, such as those earning minimum wage or receiving Social Security benefits, can afford a place to live. </p>

    <li> This estimate is at the low end of what is likely necessary to meet Americans’ housing needs. In 1960, just 13% of U.S. households had one person. By 2020, that figure was 28%. Because single-person households have increased more than fivefold from 6.9 million in 1960 to 38.1 million in 2023, more single-room housing units are probably needed as an overall share of the housing stock.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This post is the second iteration of a series of posts that provide an in-depth look at the development of Tyr, a state-of-the-art Rust GPU driver for the Linux Kernel, supporting Arm Mali CSF-based GPUs.</p>
<p>As promised in the first iteration, we will now explore how GPU drivers work in more detail by exploring an application known as <code>VkCube</code>. As the program name implies, this application uses the Vulkan API to render a rotating cube on the screen. Its simplicity makes it a prime candidate to be used as a learning aid in our journey through GPU drivers.</p>
<p>This article will first introduce the concept of User Mode Drivers (<code>UMD</code>s) and Kernel Mode Drivers (<code>KMD</code>s), breaking down the steps needed to actually describe <code>VkCube</code>'s workload to the GPU. This will be done in a more compact way for brevity as it's a rather extensive topic that has been detailed in several books.</p>
<p>We will wrap up with an overview of the actual API offered by Tyr. As previously stated, this is the same API offered by Panthor, which is the C driver for the same hardware.</p>
<h3>A quick introduction to GPU drivers</h3>
<p>It is easier to introduce this topic by considering a simple 3D application like drawing a single triangle, or VkCube, a program that will render a rotating cube on the screen. Throughout this brief introduction, I will be using the terms UMD (usermode driver) to refer to the non-privileged part of the driver. For us this is <code>panvk</code>, a Vulkan driver that is part of Mesa. The term KMD, on the other hand, refers to the privileged part of the driver. That is represented by Tyr, a kernel driver that aims to be part of the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>The starting point is to understand that a kernel-mode GPU driver connects a much larger UMD (user-mode driver) to the actual GPU. The UMD will actually implement APIs like Vulkan, OpenGL, OpenCL, and others. These APIs, in turn, will be used by actual programs to describe their workload to the GPU. This includes allocating and using not only the geometry and textures, but also the shaders being used to process said data into the final result. This means that a key aspect of GPU drivers is actually allocating GPU memory to house data related to the current scene being drawn so that it can actually be operated on by the hardware.</p>
<p>Shaders are full-blown programs running on the GPU. They are extremely powerful and can be used in a lot of ways, but for VkCube their main purpose is to place the cube in the scene, color its sides, and continuously rotate it. Notice that even a very trivial shader needs to have access to some external data to actually work. The shaders for VkCube need, at least, the geometry and color data, as well as the matrix data describing the rotation about an axis in 3D space.</p>
<p>With the data describing the model and the machine code describing the shaders, the UMD must ask the KMD to place this in GPU memory prior to execution. It must also tell the GPU that it wants to carry out a draw call and set any state needed to make this happen, which it does by means of building VkCommandBuffers, which are structures containing instructions to be carried out by the GPU in order to make the workload happen. It also needs to set up a way to be notified when the workload is done and then allocate the memory to place the results in.</p>
<p>This is quite intense at first, but neatly summarizes the interface that our GPU driver must offer. One of the main jobs of the kernel driver is allocating and mapping memory, preferably in a way that promotes isolation through some sort of context that is private to the application. Other key responsibilities include submitting work to a hardware queue where it can be considered for execution, as well as notifying the user when said work has been carried out.</p>
<p>The last part is key as we are dealing with massively parallel hardware where things may (and will) complete asynchronously and out of order. There must be a way to encode a job's dependencies and it is up to the kernel driver to make sure that these dependencies are actually followed if we are to extract anything meaningful from the result.</p>
<p>Therefore, deciding what to execute when (also known as scheduling) is a major part of a kernel mode driver.</p>
<p>Finally, it is up to the KMD to actually initialize the device and make sure that it is operational for all clients. This means powering on any clocks and voltage regulators and running any startup code to bring the device to life, at which point the KMD must make sure that the device is fairly shared among all clients by rotating the access to the hardware among the different applications using it.</p>
<h3>A key takeaway</h3>
<p>One thing to be understood from the previous section is that the majority of the complexity tends to reside at the <code>UMD</code> level. This component is in charge of translating the higher-level API commands into lower-level commands that the GPU can understand. Nevertheless the <code>KMD</code> is responsible for providing key operations such that its user-mode driver is actually implementable, and it must do so in a way that fairly shares the underlying GPU hardware among multiple tasks in the system.</p>
<h3>Our driver interface</h3>
<p>Given the previous introduction on how a modern GPU driver works, we are now in a position to formally define the interface that will be exposed by our <code>KMD</code>:</p>
<pre><code>	/** @DRM_PANTHOR_DEV_QUERY: Query device information. */
	DRM_PANTHOR_DEV_QUERY = 0,

	/**
	 * @DRM_PANTHOR_BO_MMAP_OFFSET: Get the file offset to pass to
	 * mmap to map a GEM object.
	 */

	DRM_PANTHOR_GROUP_DESTROY,

	/**
	 * @DRM_PANTHOR_GROUP_SUBMIT: Submit jobs to queues belonging
	 * to a specific scheduling group.
	 */
	DRM_PANTHOR_GROUP_SUBMIT,

	/** @DRM_PANTHOR_GROUP_GET_STATE: Get the state of a scheduling group. */
	DRM_PANTHOR_GROUP_GET_STATE,

	/** @DRM_PANTHOR_TILER_HEAP_CREATE: Create a tiler heap. */
	DRM_PANTHOR_TILER_HEAP_CREATE,

	/** @DRM_PANTHOR_TILER_HEAP_DESTROY: Destroy a tiler heap. */

<p>Note this is a rather compact API, and very far removed from our initial task of drawing a rotating cube. This fits nicely into our model where the <code>UMD</code> is in charge of handling all the drawing commands, and uses the <code>KMD</code> as a means to access the underlying GPU hardware.</p>
<p>We can break the API above into a few distinct groups:</p>
<p>1. Device information: This is represented here by the <code>DEV_QUERY</code> ioctl. Needless to say, the <code>UMD</code> needs to know some information from the underlying GPU hardware in order to work. This is usually implemented by simply reading some <code>ROM</code> (read-only memory) area in the GPU.</p>
<p>2. Memory allocation and isolation: This is represented by <code>VM_CREATE</code>, <code>VM_BIND</code>, <code>VM_DESTROY</code>, <code>VM_GET_STATE</code>, <code>BO_CREATE</code>, and <code>BO_MMAP_OFFSET</code>. We will see how this is implemented at the kernel level later.</p>
<p>3. Group creation and management:<code>GROUP_CREATE</code>, <code>GROUP_DESTROY</code>, and <code>GROUP_GET_STATE</code>. We will go into great detail on what groups are in a later installment in this series.</p>
<p>4. Job submission: This is implemented solely by <code>GROUP_SUBMIT</code>. Note that this call is extremely important, as it's how we submit our device-specific command buffers that describe what operations are to be carried out by the GPU hardware.</p>
<p>5. Tiler heap management: This is represented by <code>TILER_HEAP_CREATE</code> and <code>TILER_HEAP_DESTROY</code>. Explaining how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_rendering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tiling GPUs</a> work is so far beyond the scope of this series, but for the time being, it is enough to assume that they need a variable amount of internal memory in order to draw the geometry. This pool of memory is managed by the <code>UMD</code> through the interface presented here.</p>
<h3>What's next</h3>
<p>This article introduced some key concepts about how GPU drivers work. We will use these concepts in subsequent parts of this series as we delve further into Arm's CSF hardware.</p>
<p>The next section will explore the CSF architecture, introducing components like the Micro Controller Unit (i.e.: <code>MCU</code>) that underpins the design, as well as the steps needed to get it to boot.</p>

		Model Overview
	</span>
</h2>
<p><strong>Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507</strong> has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type: Causal Language Models</li>
<li>Training Stage: Pretraining &amp; Post-training</li>
<li>Number of Parameters: 4.0B</li>
<li>Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 3.6B</li>
<li>Number of Layers: 36</li>
<li>Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 32 for Q and 8 for KV</li>
<li>Context Length: <strong>262,144 natively</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE: This model supports only thinking mode. Meanwhile, specifying <code>enable_thinking=True</code> is no longer required.</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, to enforce model thinking, the default chat template automatically includes <code>&lt;think&gt;</code>. Therefore, it is normal for the model's output to contain only <code>&lt;/think&gt;</code> without an explicit opening <code>&lt;think&gt;</code> tag.</p>

<p>The code of Qwen3 has been in the latest Hugging Face <code>transformers</code> and we advise you to use the latest version of <code>transformers</code>.</p>
<p>With <code>transformers&lt;4.51.0</code>, you will encounter the following error:</p>

<p>For deployment, you can use <code>sglang&gt;=0.4.6.post1</code> or <code>vllm&gt;=0.8.5</code> or to create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint:</p>
<ul>
<li>SGLang:<pre><code>python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 --context-length 262144  --reasoning-parser deepseek-r1

<li>vLLM:<pre><code>vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 --max-model-len 262144 --enable-reasoning --reasoning-parser deepseek_r1
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: If you encounter out-of-memory (OOM) issues, you may consider reducing the context length to a smaller value. However, since the model may require longer token sequences for reasoning, we strongly recommend using a context length greater than 131,072 when possible.</strong></p>
<p>For local use, applications such as Ollama, LMStudio, MLX-LM, llama.cpp, and KTransformers have also supported Qwen3.</p>

<p>Qwen3 excels in tool calling capabilities. We recommend using <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent">Qwen-Agent</a> to make the best use of agentic ability of Qwen3. Qwen-Agent encapsulates tool-calling templates and tool-calling parsers internally, greatly reducing coding complexity.</p>
<p>To define the available tools, you can use the MCP configuration file, use the integrated tool of Qwen-Agent, or integrate other tools by yourself.</p>

		Best Practices
	</span>
</h2>
<p>To achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Sampling Parameters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We suggest using <code>Temperature=0.6</code>, <code>TopP=0.95</code>, <code>TopK=20</code>, and <code>MinP=0</code>.</li>
<li>For supported frameworks, you can adjust the <code>presence_penalty</code> parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetitions. However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Adequate Output Length</strong>: We recommend using an output length of 32,768 tokens for most queries. For benchmarking on highly complex problems, such as those found in math and programming competitions, we suggest setting the max output length to 81,920 tokens. This provides the model with sufficient space to generate detailed and comprehensive responses, thereby enhancing its overall performance.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Standardize Output Format</strong>: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Math Problems</strong>: Include "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}." in the prompt.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple-Choice Questions</strong>: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: "Please show your choice in the <code>answer</code> field with only the choice letter, e.g., <code>"answer": "C"</code>."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>No Thinking Content in History</strong>: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content. It is implemented in the provided chat template in Jinja2. However, for frameworks that do not directly use the Jinja2 chat template, it is up to the developers to ensure that the best practice is followed.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Although I try to make good use of the debugger, I am quite used to print-based
debugging, especially for unit tests. I wanted to explore some tricks to improve
print-based debugging, and also incorporate the debugger more.</p>
<h2 id="print-based-debugging-improved">print-based debugging improved</h2>
<p>One big problem with using print debugging is spammy output. If I am
running something in a loop, and only one iteration of the loop has anything
interesting, I still need to filter and sort through every iteration's output.</p>
<p>Or perhaps I am working with some data structure that has a printable
representation that is easier to parse than the raw data; if I don't know where
the error comes from I would have to litter print functions everywhere hoping to
catch the necessary context.</p>
<p>However, I realized that since zig tests use <code>error</code>s, instead of panics, it is
possible to use <code>errdefer</code> to print something only when a test actually fails.</p>
<pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span>test</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>errdefer</span> std.debug.<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"{f}"</span><span>,</span> .<span>{</span>ast<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>    <span>// ...
</span></span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Does a fantastic job of avoiding cluttering the code, and providing the precise
context necessary when an error actually occurs.</p>
<h2 id="running-tests-in-the-debugger">Running tests in the debugger</h2>
<p>If anything more complex is necessary, using the debugger is the way to go.
However, naively trying to run <code>seergdb</code> or <code>gdb -tui</code> directly from the
terminal gets difficult, as the test binaries are not in <code>zig-out</code> directory
(understandably) but in the <code>zig-cache</code> directory.</p>
<p>I learned a trick from <a href="https://ziggit.dev/t/zig-debugging-with-lldb/3931/7?u=glfmn">ziggit</a> that the <code>build.zig</code> can run
commands, and you can feed the artifact path of a build step as an argument into
the command:</p>
<figure>
  <figcaption><cite>build.zig</cite></figcaption>
  <pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span>// seergdb is a gdb gui frontend
</span></span><span><span>const</span> debugger <span>=</span> b.<span>addSystemCommand</span><span>(</span>&amp;.<span>{</span> <span>"seergdb"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--run"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--"</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>debugger.<span>addArtifactArg</span><span>(</span>exe_unit_tests<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>const</span> debug_step <span>=</span> b.<span>step</span><span>(</span><span>"debug"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Run unit tests under debugger"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>debug_step.<span>dependOn</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>debugger.step<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This makes it really easy to run the proper binary; however, this isn't enough
on its own: the debugger only kicks into action for a breakpoint or panic, but
the test runner gracefully handles errors.</p>
<p>We can get around this by adding <code>@breakpoint</code> calls, but then we are
potentially back to square one, where we have to speculatively add breakpoints
and catch the precise moment where things fail, or have to manually step through
until failure.</p>
<h2 id="combining-tricks">Combining tricks</h2>
<p>Of course, a good solution is to use:</p>
<pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span>test</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>errdefer</span> <span>@breakpoint</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This will break the program at the precise moment we hit an error. There's a
chance enough context is still around to snoop at with the debugger, and we
would also have the debug printing that the <code>std.testing.expect{.*}</code> functions
provide.</p>
<p>However, this does have downsides. Consider the program:</p>
<pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span>test</span> <span>"errdefer @breakpoint()"</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>errdefer</span> <span>@breakpoint</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> <span>error</span><span>.</span><span>FixMe</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>test</span> <span>"normal test"</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> <span>error</span><span>.</span><span>FixMe</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>If we run <code>zig build test</code>, instead of reporting individual test errors, the
summary will just report that the entire test <em>step</em> failed:</p>
<pre><code><span>error: while executing test 'main.test.@"errdefer @breakpoint()"',
</span><span>the following command terminated with signal 5 (expected exited with code 0):
</span><span>
</span><span>  ./.zig-cache/o/348ca1907303b41ca8e0fceafd43ad63/test \
</span><span>    --cache-dir=./.zig-cache \
</span><span>    --seed=0xe3f1cf05 --listen=-
</span></code></pre>
<p>If we still want to preserve the normal behavior except when we actually <em>want</em>
to break for a debugger, then we need one more trick.</p>
<h2 id="conditional-compilation">Conditional compilation</h2>
<p>The Zig build system allows us use
<a href="https://ziglang.org/learn/build-system/#conditional-compilation">build options to pass compile time values</a> to our program. We
can leverage these to pass a <code>bool</code> to decide when to call <code>@breakpoint</code> in
our tests.</p>
<p>Starting from a simple build script that only runs tests:</p>

</span></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>We can add the compile time option like so:</p>
<figure>
  <figcaption><cite>build.zig</cite></figcaption>
  <pre data-linenos="" data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><table><tbody><tr><td>4</td><td><span><span>const</span> options <span>=</span> b.<span>addOptions</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

</span></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>We need to add the generated options module to our lib:</p>
<figure>
  <figcaption><cite>build.zig</cite></figcaption>
  <pre data-linenos="" data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><table><tbody><tr><td>16</td><td><span>lib.<span>addImport</span><span>(</span><span>"config"</span><span>,</span> options.<span>createModule</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

</figure>
<p>Then, in our <code>root.zig</code> file we can reference the options like so:</p>
<figure>
  <figcaption><cite>root.zig</cite></figcaption>
  <pre data-linenos="" data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><table><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><span><span>const</span> std <span>=</span> <span>@import</span><span>(</span><span>"std"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

</span></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now, we can run the test and get no breakpoint:</p>
<pre><code><span>zig build test
</span></code></pre>
<p>However, we run into a snag: this value is observable to our program, but
we have to recompile the <code>build.zig</code> in order to change the value. We need
to add the option to the build system itself:</p>
<figure>
  <figcaption><cite>build.zig</cite></figcaption>
  <pre data-linenos="" data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><table><tbody><tr><td>4</td><td><span><span>var</span> options <span>=</span> b.<span>addOptions</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

</span></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now we can run:</p>
<pre><code><span>zig build -Ddebugger test
</span></code></pre>
<p>And observe the change in behavior.</p>
<p>As a final step, we can hook up the command to run our debugger when
the <code>use_debugger</code> flag is set like so:</p>
<figure>
  <figcaption><cite>build.zig</cite></figcaption>
  <pre data-linenos="" data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><table><tbody><tr><td>29</td><td><span><span>const</span> test_step <span>=</span> b.<span>step</span><span>(</span><span>"test"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Run tests"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

</span></td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td><span><span>}</span>
</span></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Now, if we run with the <code>-Ddebugger</code> flag, the test runner will automatically
run in the debugger, and will break on error! See a screenshot <a href="https://glfmn.io/posts/zig-error-patterns/seergdb.png">here</a>.</p>
<p>It might be nice to encapsulate the config option checking in a function:</p>
<pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span>fn</span> <span>breakForDebugger</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>void</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>config.debugger<span>)</span> <span>@breakpoint</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>But I leave that up to your judgement.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>If you want to solve a tricky problem, it often helps to get organized. You might, for example, break the problem into pieces and tackle the easiest pieces first. But this kind of sorting has a cost. You may end up spending too much time putting the pieces in order.</p>
<p>This dilemma is especially relevant to one of the most iconic problems in computer science: finding the shortest path from a specific starting point in a network to every other point. It’s like a souped-up version of a problem you need to solve each time you move: learning the best route from your new home to work, the gym and the supermarket.</p>
<p>“Shortest-paths is a beautiful problem that anyone in the world can relate to,” said <a href="https://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~mthorup/">Mikkel Thorup</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Copenhagen.</p>
<p>Intuitively, it should be easiest to find the shortest path to nearby destinations. So if you want to design the fastest possible algorithm for the shortest-paths problem, it seems reasonable to start by finding the closest point, then the next-closest, and so on. But to do that, you need to repeatedly figure out which point is closest. You’ll sort the points by distance as you go. There’s a fundamental speed limit for any algorithm that follows this approach: You can’t go any faster than the time it takes to sort.</p>
<p>Forty years ago, researchers designing shortest-paths algorithms ran up against this “sorting barrier.” Now, a team of researchers has devised <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17033">a new algorithm that breaks it</a>. It doesn’t sort, and it runs faster than any algorithm that does.</p>
<p>“The authors were audacious in thinking they could break this barrier,” said <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/ret">Robert Tarjan</a>, a computer scientist at Princeton University. “It’s an amazing result.”</p>
<h2><strong>The Frontier of Knowledge</strong></h2>
<p>To analyze the shortest-paths problem mathematically, researchers use the language of graphs — networks of points, or nodes, connected by lines. Each link between nodes is labeled with a number called its weight, which can represent the length of that segment or the time needed to traverse it. There are usually many routes between any two nodes, and the shortest is the one whose weights add up to the smallest number. Given a graph and a specific “source” node, an algorithm’s goal is to find the shortest path to every other node.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-establish-the-best-way-to-traverse-a-graph-20241025/">most famous shortest-paths algorithm</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01386390">devised</a> by the pioneering computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1956, starts at the source and works outward step by step. It’s an effective approach because knowing the shortest path to nearby nodes can help you find the shortest paths to more distant ones. But because the end result is a sorted list of shortest paths, the sorting barrier sets a fundamental limit on how fast the algorithm can run.</p>

<p>In 1984, Tarjan and another researcher <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/28869.28874">improved Dijkstra’s original algorithm</a> so that it hit this speed limit. Any further improvement would have to come from an algorithm that avoids sorting.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Thorup and other researchers devised algorithms that broke the sorting barrier, but they needed to make <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/316542.316548">certain</a> <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S0097539702419650">assumptions</a> about weights. Nobody knew how to extend their techniques to arbitrary weights. It seemed they’d hit the end of the road.</p>
<p>“The research stopped for a very long time,” said <a href="https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/People/Faculty/DuanRan.htm">Ran Duan</a>, a computer scientist at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “Many people believed that there’s no better way.”</p>
<p>Duan wasn’t one of them. He’d long dreamed of building a shortest-paths algorithm that could break through the sorting barrier on all graphs. Last fall, he finally succeeded.</p>
<h2><strong>Out of Sorts</strong></h2>

<p>Duan’s interest in the sorting barrier dates back nearly 20 years to his time in graduate school at the University of Michigan, where his adviser was one of the researchers who worked out how to break the barrier in specific cases. But it wasn’t until 2021 that Duan devised a more promising approach.</p>
<p>The key was to focus on where the algorithm goes next at each step. Dijkstra’s algorithm takes the region that it has already explored in previous steps. It decides where to go next by scanning this region’s “frontier” — that is, all the nodes connected to its boundary. This doesn’t take much time at first, but it gets slower as the algorithm progresses.</p>
<p>Duan instead envisioned grouping neighboring nodes on the frontier into clusters. He would then only consider one node from each cluster. With fewer nodes to sift through, the search could be faster at each step. The algorithm also might end up going somewhere other than the closest node, so the sorting barrier wouldn’t apply. But ensuring that this clustering-based approach actually made the algorithm faster rather than slower would be a challenge.</p>
<p>Duan fleshed out this basic idea over the following year, and by fall 2022, he was optimistic that he could surmount the technical hurdles. He roped in three graduate students to help work out the details, and a few months later they arrived at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04139">a partial solution</a> — an algorithm that broke the sorting barrier for any weights, but only on so-called undirected graphs.</p>
<p>In undirected graphs, every link can be traversed in both directions. Computer scientists are usually more interested in the broader class of graphs that feature one-way paths, but these “directed” graphs are often trickier to navigate.</p>
<p>“There could be a case that A can reach B very easily, but B cannot reach A very easily,” said <a href="https://matthew99a.github.io/">Xiao Mao</a>, a computer science graduate student at Stanford University. “That’s going to give you a lot of trouble.”</p>
<h2><strong>Promising Paths</strong></h2>
<p>In the summer of 2023, Mao heard Duan give a talk about the undirected-graph algorithm at a conference in California. He struck up a conversation with Duan, whose work he’d long admired.</p>
<p>“I met him for the first time in real life,” Mao recalled. “It was very exciting.”</p>

<p>After the conference, Mao began thinking about the problem in his spare time. Meanwhile, Duan and his colleagues were exploring new approaches that could work on directed graphs. They took inspiration from another venerable algorithm for the shortest-paths problem, called the Bellman-Ford algorithm, that doesn’t produce a sorted list. At first glance, it seemed like an unwise strategy, since the Bellman-Ford algorithm is much slower than Dijkstra’s.</p>
<p>“Whenever you do research, you try to take a promising path,” Thorup said. “I would almost call it anti-promising to take Bellman-Ford, because it looks completely like the stupidest thing you could possibly do.”</p>
<p>Duan’s team avoided the slowness of the Bellman-Ford algorithm by running it for just a few steps at a time. This selective use of Bellman-Ford enabled their algorithm to scout ahead for the most valuable nodes to explore in later steps. These nodes are like intersections of major thoroughfares in a road network.</p>
<p>“You have to pass through [them] to get the shortest path to a lot of other stuff,” Thorup said.</p>
<p>In March 2024, Mao thought of another promising approach. Some key steps in the team’s original approach had used randomness. <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-randomness-improves-algorithms-20230403/">Randomized algorithms</a> can efficiently solve many problems, but researchers still prefer nonrandom approaches. Mao devised a new way to solve the shortest-paths problem without randomness. He joined the team, and they worked together over the following months via group chats and video calls to merge their ideas. Finally, in the fall, Duan realized they could adapt a technique from <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10658">an algorithm</a> he’d devised in 2018 that broke the sorting barrier for a different graph problem. That technique was the last piece they needed for an algorithm that ran faster than Dijkstra’s on both directed and undirected graphs.</p>
        
        
<p>The finished algorithm slices the graph into layers, moving outward from the source like Dijkstra’s. But rather than deal with the whole frontier at each step, it uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm to pinpoint influential nodes, moves forward from these nodes to find the shortest paths to others, and later comes back to other frontier nodes. It doesn’t always find the nodes within each layer in order of increasing distance, so the sorting barrier doesn’t apply. And if you chop up the graph in the right way, it runs slightly faster than the best version of Dijkstra’s algorithm. It’s considerably more intricate, relying on many pieces that need to fit together just right. But curiously, none of the pieces use fancy mathematics.</p>
<p>“This thing might as well have been discovered 50 years ago, but it wasn’t,” Thorup said. “That makes it that much more impressive.”</p>
<p>Duan and his team plan to explore whether the algorithm can be streamlined to make it even faster. With the sorting barrier vanquished, the new algorithm’s runtime isn’t close to any fundamental limit that computer scientists know of.</p>
<p>“Being an optimist, I would not be surprised if you could take it down even further,” Tarjan said. “I certainly don’t think this is the last step in the process.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>I <b>love</b> dotfiles.</p>

<p>
  “Dotfiles” is a term that refers to configuration files used to configure
  software and operating systems. They are called such because often these files
  start with a dot. You may have seen
  <code>.bashrc</code>,
  <code>.tmux.conf</code> or
  <code>.zshrc</code> in the wild.
</p>

<p>
  Whenever a software doesn’t offer direct file-based configuration, I feel sad
  because it means I need to take extra steps to keep my configuration across
  different devices in sync or when setting up a new machine.
</p>

<p>I <b>love</b> sharing.</p>

<p>
  I regularly publish ideas and experiences in
  <a href="https://hamatti.org/blog">my blog</a>, I share my notes in
  <a href="https://notes.hamatti.org/">my digital garden</a>
  and I publish almost all the code I write (outside work) as open source
  <a href="https://github.com/hamatti">in GitHub</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I <b>love</b> to read
  <a href="https://github.com/search?q=dotfiles&amp;type=repositories">other people’s dotfiles</a>
  and learn from them.
</p>

<p>
  Yet, somehow I feel like sharing my own dotfiles to the world is beyond my
  comfort zone. I feel my customisations and aliases and other decisions are too
  intimate and personal to share.
</p>

<p>I don’t quite know why though.</p>

<p>
  I have a really cool repository where I keep my dotfiles and there’s quite a
  lot there. There’s the usual suspects like my
  <code>zsh</code> config and aliases, my
  <code>tmux</code> configuration and my
  <code>neovim</code> and
  <code>vscode</code> stuff too. And my
  <a href="https://hamatti.org/posts/bring-your-custom-toolkit-to-repl-sessions/">Python startup script</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I also keep my
  <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> core list
  there: that’s all the packages I want to always have at hand. Having them all
  in one place to be installed with a single command on a new computer is
  lovely.
</p>

<p>
  I also keep my
  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/">Stylus</a>
  CSS rules there so I can easily bring the experience I want on any browser I
  use.
</p>

<p>
  I use
  <a href="https://notes.hamatti.org/technology/recipes/manage-dotfiles-with-gnu-stow">GNU Stow to manage most of these</a>. For anything that’s directly applicable by copying the files into a given
  folder, I’ve set up the folder structure so that running
  <code>stow [folder]</code> will create symlinks to
  right places: any change made into the repository from any machine will apply
  to all machines. It’s so cool.
</p>

<p>
  All in all, my dotfiles repository is home to 19 configuration files +
  everything my neovim installation has, plugins and all.
</p>

<p>
  For now however, I
  <i>keep them secret, keep them safe </i>until I
  feel better about sharing my dotfiles with the world.

<p>Google is the latest company to suffer a data breach in an ongoing wave of Salesforce CRM data theft attacks conducted by the ShinyHunters extortion group.</p>

<p>In June, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-hackers-target-salesforce-accounts-in-data-extortion-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Google warned</a> that a threat actor they classify as 'UNC6040' is targeting companies' employees in voice phishing (vishing) social engineering attacks to breach Salesforce instances and download customer data. This data is then used to extort companies into paying a ransom to prevent the data from being leaked.</p>

<p>In a brief update to the article last night, Google said that it too fell victim to the same attack in June after one of its Salesforce CRM instances was breached and customer data was stolen.</p>

<p>"In June, one of Google's corporate Salesforce instances was impacted by similar UNC6040 activity described in this post. Google responded to the activity, performed an impact analysis and began mitigations," <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/voice-phishing-data-extortion" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reads Google's update</a>.</p>

<p>"The instance was used to store contact information and related notes for small and medium businesses. Analysis revealed that data was retrieved by the threat actor during a small window of time before the access was cut off."</p>

<p>"The data retrieved by the threat actor was confined to basic and largely publicly available business information, such as business names and contact details."</p>

<p>Google is classifying the threat actors behind these attacks as 'UNC6040' or 'UNC6240.' However, BleepingComputer, which has been tracking these attacks, has learned that a notorious threat actor known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shinyhunters-behind-salesforce-data-theft-attacks-at-qantas-allianz-life-and-lvmh/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ShinyHunters is behind the attacks</a>.</p>

<p>ShinyHunters has been around for years, responsible for a wide range of breaches, including those at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/powerschool-hacker-now-extorting-individual-school-districts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PowerSchool</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-customers-confirm-data-stolen-in-alleged-cloud-breach-is-valid/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Oracle Cloud</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/snowflake/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Snowflake data-theft attacks</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/old-atandt-data-leak-repackaged-to-link-ssns-dobs-to-49m-phone-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">AT&amp;T</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-leaks-full-database-of-77-million-nitro-pdf-user-records/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">NitroPDF</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wattpad-data-breach-exposes-account-info-for-millions-of-users/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Wattpad</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mathway-investigates-data-breach-after-25m-records-sold-on-dark-web/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">MathWay</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-leaks-386-million-user-records-from-18-companies-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">many more</a>.</p>

<p>In a conversation with BleepingComputer yesterday, ShinyHunters claimed to have breached many Salesforce instances, with attacks still ongoing.</p>

<p>The threat actor claimed yesterday to BleepingComputer that they breached a trillion-dollar company, and were considering just leaking the data rather than attempting to extort them. It is unclear if this company is Google.</p>

<p>As for the other companies impacted in these attacks, the threat actor is extorting&nbsp;them through email, demanding they pay a ransom to prevent the data from being publicly leaked.</p>

<p>Once the threat actor has finished privately extorting companies, they plan to publicly leak or sell data on a hacking forum.</p>

<p>BleepingComputer has learned of one company that has already paid 4 Bitcoins, or approximately $400,000, to prevent the leak of their data.</p>

<p>Other companies impacted in these attacks include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/adidas-warns-of-data-breach-after-customer-service-provider-hack/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Adidas</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qantas-confirms-data-breach-impacts-57-million-customers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Qantas</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/allianz-life-confirms-data-breach-impacts-majority-of-14-million-customers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Allianz Life</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisco-discloses-data-breach-impacting-ciscocom-user-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Cisco</a>, and the&nbsp;LVMH subsidiaries&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/louis-vuitton-says-regional-data-breaches-tied-to-same-cyberattack/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Louis Vuitton</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fashion-giant-dior-discloses-cyberattack-warns-of-data-breach/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Dior</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chosun.com/english/industry-en/2025/05/26/ORM5MULB7NEM7EBUFVXHVLSB4A/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Tiffany &amp; Co.</a></p>

<p>The only time a conservative can be a good thing, is when people push to be superior off of merit and good character, and typically showing humility is still required. &nbsp;Unfortunately for everyone else, its so much easier to be superior using bad behaviors than good ones. &nbsp;Hence dictatorships, war and conflict exist in spades. Forcing others to be lower is a conservative cornerstone. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Confederacy, Nazis, Most Monarchies, Oligarchies, Zionists, Religious fanatics… conservatism without morals, superiority attained without humility and empathy.</p>

<p>To be honest I do not have enough faith in MAGA for them to be told this never existed and not believe it. They believe almost anything they are told to believe.</p>

<p>EDIT: now that I think about it more, would you really put it past this regime to pull up some archaic law from 1790 that interprets something as not being legal because it isn’t in on public display and then say that being “online“ is what public display is now? I mean, that’s really what their M.O. has been; carry out what you want to do through EO instead of legal channels,  slow down the judiciary trying to stop you from breaking the law, tell your cult this is judicial overreach when they inevitably rule against you and then just do what you want anyway until you create a crisis. Then if you do get forced back in line do it quietly  and tell your propaganda machine not to mention it so the cult still believes you are the God King they want you to be.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2><a id="user-content-overview" aria-label="Permalink: Overview" href="#overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Claude Code IDE for Emacs provides native integration with Claude Code CLI through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Unlike simple terminal wrappers, this package creates a bidirectional bridge between Claude and Emacs, enabling Claude to understand and leverage Emacs’ powerful features—from LSP and project management to custom Elisp functions. This transforms Claude into a true Emacs-aware AI assistant that works within your existing workflow and can interact with your entire Emacs ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
  <li>Automatic project detection and session management</li>
  <li>Terminal integration with full color support using <code>vterm</code> or <code>eat</code></li>
  <li>MCP protocol implementation for IDE integration</li>
  <li>Tool support for file operations, editor state, and workspace info</li>
  <li>Extensible MCP tools server for accessing Emacs commands (xrefs, tree-sitter, project info, e.g.)</li>
  <li>Diagnostic integration with Flycheck and Flymake</li>
  <li>Advanced diff view with ediff integration</li>
  <li>Tab-bar support for proper context switching</li>
  <li>Selection and buffer tracking for better context awareness</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Emacs Tool Integration</h2><a id="user-content-emacs-tool-integration" aria-label="Permalink: Emacs Tool Integration" href="#emacs-tool-integration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This package enables Claude Code to leverage the full power of Emacs through MCP tools integration. Claude can directly access and utilize Emacs capabilities including:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
  <li><b>Language Server Protocol (LSP)</b> integration through xref commands for intelligent code navigation (eglot, lsp-mode and others)</li>
  <li><b>Tree-sitter</b> for syntax tree analysis and understanding code structure at the AST level</li>
  <li><b>Imenu</b> for structured symbol listing and navigation within files</li>
  <li><b>Project</b> integration for project-aware operations</li>
  <li><b>Any Emacs command or function</b> can be exposed as an MCP tool, allowing Claude to:
    <ul dir="auto">
      <li>Perform project-wide searches and refactoring</li>
      <li>Access specialized modes and their features</li>
      <li>Execute custom Elisp functions tailored to your workflow</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This deep integration means Claude Code understands your project context and can leverage Emacs’ extensive ecosystem to provide more intelligent and context-aware assistance.</p>

On the spy chief’s agenda: moving vast amounts of top secret intelligence material into the US company’s cloud.</p><p>Meeting at Microsoft’s headquarters near Seattle, a former chicken farm turned hi-tech campus, the spymaster, Yossi Sariel, won Nadella’s support for a plan that would grant Unit 8200 access to a customised<strong> </strong>and segregated area within Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform.</p><p>Armed with Azure’s near-limitless storage capacity, Unit 8200 began building a powerful new mass surveillance tool: a sweeping and intrusive system that collects and stores recordings of millions of mobile phone calls made each day by Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.</p><p>Revealed here for the first time in an investigation by the Guardian with the Israeli-Palestinian publication <a href="https://www.972mag.com/microsoft-8200-intelligence-surveillance-cloud-azure/" data-link-name="in body link">+972 Magazine</a> and Hebrew-language outlet <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/%d7%9e%d7%99%d7%9c%d7%99%d7%95%d7%9f-%d7%a9%d7%99%d7%97%d7%95%d7%aa-%d7%91%d7%a9%d7%a2%d7%94-%d7%94%d7%9e%d7%90%d7%92%d7%a8-%d7%a9%d7%9c-8200-%d7%a2%d7%9c-%d7%a9%d7%a8%d7%aa%d7%99-%d7%9e%d7%99/" data-link-name="in body link">Local Call</a>, the cloud-based system – which first<strong> </strong>became operational in 2022 – enables Unit 8200 to store a giant trove of calls daily for extended periods of time.</p><p>Microsoft claims Nadella was unaware of what kind of data Unit 8200 planned to store in Azure. But a cache of leaked Microsoft documents and interviews with 11 sources from the company and Israeli military intelligence reveals how Azure has been used by Unit 8200 to store this expansive archive of everyday Palestinian communications.</p><figure id="ec7a4436-c12a-444c-8657-b5710428aaeb" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.GuideAtomBlockElement"><gu-island name="GuideAtomWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;567057a3-5948-48a4-adbd-7698fd9a54e8&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Contact the reporters about this story&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<p><strong></strong></p><p>If you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.</p><p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p><p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It’s unclear if all of this data belongs to Unit 8200; some may belong to other Israeli military units.</p><p>According to the files, Unit 8200 informed Microsoft that it planned to move over time<strong> </strong>as much as 70% of its data, including secret and top secret data, into Azure and was willing to “push the envelope” with the kind of sensitive and classified information that intelligence agencies normally held on their own servers. “They’re always trying to challenge the status quo,” one executive noted.</p><p>Asked about Sariel’s meeting with Nadella, Microsoft’s spokesperson said it “is not accurate” to say the CEO provided his personal support for the project with Unit 8200. They said Nadella “attended for 10 minutes at the end of the meeting” and there was “no discussion” of the content of the data the unit planned to move into Azure.</p><p>However, according to internal Microsoft records of the meeting seen by the Guardian, Nadella offered support for Sariel’s aspiration to move so much of the elite surveillance unit’s data into the cloud, described earlier in the meeting as including sensitive intelligence material.</p><p>“Satya suggested that we identify certain workloads to begin with and then gradually move towards the 70% mark,” one record states. It adds that Nadella said “building the partnership is so critical” and “Microsoft is committed to providing resources to support.”</p><h2 id="the-solution-to-our-problems"><strong>‘The solution to our problems’</strong></h2><p>Several months before meeting Microsoft CEO Nadella in 2021, Sariel had published a book about artificial intelligence under a pen name – revealed by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/05/top-israeli-spy-chief-exposes-his-true-identity-in-online-security-lapse" data-link-name="in body link">the Guardian</a> to be the spy chief’s – in which he urged militaries and intelligence agencies to “migrate to the cloud”.</p><p>Known within Israeli intelligence as a tech evangelist, Sariel valued what he characterised to colleagues as a friendly relationship with Nadella, according to a senior intelligence source. “Yossi bragged a lot, even to me, about his connection with Satya,” they said. (Microsoft denied that Nadella and Sariel had a close relationship.)</p><p>“He sold [the partnership] internally and got a huge budget,” another former intelligence colleague said. “He claimed it was the solution to our problems in the Palestinian arena.”</p><p>Sariel declined to comment and referred the Guardian’s questions about the project to the Israel Defence Forces.

According to one, enthusiasm for the system had grown among intelligence officers working on Gaza as the war progressed and they saw the military is “heading towards long-term control there”.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two weeks ago, I had what I can only describe as a <strong>punch-to-the-stomach moment</strong> (which luckily doesn’t happen very often). The AirGradient ONE - our monitor that was recognized in one of the world’s most rigorous scientific evaluations - suddenly became <strong>“Not Recommended”</strong> by WIRED magazine in their <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-indoor-air-quality-monitors/">The Best Indoor Air Quality Monitors</a> review.</p><p>Yes, this is the same monitor that got two awards from the <a href="https://airlab.solutions/en/actualites/resultats-du-challenge-airlab-microcapteurs-2023-203" target="_blank">AirLab micro sensor challenge</a> , one of the most rigorous sensor testing programs, <strong>beating more than 30 other well known brands</strong>. And yes, this is also the same monitor that the University of Cambridge chose -after rigorous testing- for the largest study on classroom air quality in the world. And yes, it’s the same monitor that is loved by thousands of Home Assistant users for its easy and local integration.</p><p>Today, I want to share why we feel that this is a <strong>flawed review</strong> and the larger picture of how influential publications’ recommendations affect manufacturers as well as consumers.</p><p>As the founder of AirGradient, many of you know that <strong>transparency is how we operate</strong>. This is why we are open-source and why we openly talk about our successes as well as our failures. We work closely with scientists and communities to improve air quality.</p><p>We’re often more critical of ourselves than others are, constantly raising our own bar. So when something like this happens, it feels <strong>deeply unfair</strong>, like when a teacher gives you an F because your pencil broke during the exam, while giving As to students who didn’t even submit their work. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves; we will explain the details below.</p><p>We’re a small team building open-source monitors, competing against companies with <strong>massive marketing budgets and PR machines</strong>. We started as a volunteer project in Thailand, putting impact before profit.</p><p>What we lack in marketing power, we make up for with genuine care, transparency, and authenticity. Over <strong>50,000 users</strong> trust our open-source approach because we believe in giving people control over their data and the ability to repair their own devices. Our monitors offer much more value at a lower price, and our competitors are probably not very happy about this.</p><p>Many companies would try to sweep this “Not Recommended” review under the rug or send lawyers. But I feel I have a responsibility here to <strong>address this head-on</strong>, because our community deserves to know the details, and hopefully, this will trigger a larger discussion around the integrity of tech journalism.</p><p>Now, at this point, I would really recommend that you read the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-indoor-air-quality-monitors/">review</a> so that you can <strong>form your own opinion</strong> about it.</p><h2 id="why-did-the-airgradient-one-get-a-not-recommended">Why did the AirGradient One get a “Not Recommended”?</h2><p>The <strong>primary reason</strong> cited for the “Not Recommended” label was a <strong>failing display</strong> on the review unit. Let me be clear: this was a legitimate hardware failure, and we take full responsibility for it. As soon as we learned about the issue, we immediately sent replacement parts and a new unit, including repair instructions, as repairability is one of our core differentiators.</p><p>However, the reviewers logic is difficult to follow when you compare it across products:</p><ul><li><strong>Our monitor</strong>: Downgraded due to a faulty display (a warranty-covered hardware issue)</li><li><strong>Another Monitor</strong>: Recommended, despite having <strong>no display at all</strong></li><li><strong>Another Monitor</strong>: Also recommended, despite <strong>lacking a CO2 sensor</strong>—one of the most critical metrics for assessing indoor air quality and ventilation</li></ul><p>How can a product be penalized for a failing display when another recommended product has no display? How can an indoor monitor without CO2 sensing - essential for understanding indoor air quality - be recommended over one that includes this crucial measurement?</p><p>If the author had reached out regarding the failing display (a single unit from any brand can fail - even those known for high quality) and noted that their first unit failed in the final review, we would understand. But to fail the whole unit on what we know is an isolated issue feels very unfair.</p><div><p>However, what’s <strong>most shocking</strong> for me is that this review is labelled as “The Best Indoor Air Quality Monitors”, yet it has <strong>basically no testing methodology at all</strong> and is pretty much purely based on the personal preferences of the author.</p></div><p>The icing on the cake is that I actually corresponded with the author about the issues and sent detailed explanations of our methodology concerns. The responses I got back were limited to brief acknowledgements like “Received. I’m on deadline for three other stories and cannot give you a timeline.”</p><p>This response encapsulates many things wrong with the current state of tech journalism: recommendations that affect <strong>livelihoods and purchasing decisions</strong> are treated as just deadlines to meet, not as professional evaluations that deserve rigorous methodology and meaningful dialogue.</p><p>I wonder how much the author actually cares about the quality and correctness of her reviews.</p><h2 id="when-reviews-fail-everyone-pays">When Reviews Fail, Everyone Pays</h2><p>WIRED’s recommendations don’t just influence individual purchases; they have the power to <strong>shape entire market perceptions</strong>. When they say “Not Recommended,” small companies like ours feel a real reputational and financial impact.</p><p>Now, if this were based on a clear methodology and evaluation, I would probably be the first one who would jump into gear and improve our product (which I have done in the past, e.g. when we had issues with the <a href="https://www.airgradient.com/blog/update-on-pms5003-calibration/">calibration of our PM sensors</a>). But getting ‘Not Recommended’ based on <strong>basically non-existent methodology</strong> leaves me frustrated. How do you argue against personal preference?</p><p><strong>BUT it’s not only us who lose, ultimately it’s the consumer!</strong></p><p>When a major publication abandons objective methodology in favor of subjective impressions, readers get recommendations based on <strong>one person’s preferences</strong> rather than a fair and comprehensive evaluation. They miss out on products that might better serve their actual needs, whether that’s due to repairability, accuracy, connectivity or comprehensive sensor coverage.</p><p>Here’s what any credible product review should include—especially when the publication claims to identify “the best” products:</p><ul><li><strong>Clear Evaluation Criteria</strong>: Define what makes a product good or bad upfront. Is it accuracy? Usability? Value? Readers deserve to know the standards being applied, not discover them through inconsistent conclusions.</li><li><strong>Consistent Methodology</strong>: Apply the same criteria to every product. If display quality matters for one device, it should matter for all devices. If a feature is praised in one product, it shouldn’t be ignored in another.</li><li><strong>Objective Testing</strong>: Use measurable standards wherever possible. For technical products, this means controlled conditions, standardized protocols, and leveraging existing independent testing data rather than relying solely on personal impressions.</li><li><strong>Multiple Data Points</strong>: Test more than one unit when possible, especially if hardware failures occur. A single faulty device shouldn’t define an entire product line’s quality.</li><li><strong>Feature-Based Analysis</strong>: Evaluate products based on their intended use and core capabilities. What problems are they designed to solve? How well do they solve them compared to alternatives?</li><li><strong>Transparent Process</strong>: Explain how conclusions were reached. What was tested? Under what conditions? What weights were given to different criteria?</li></ul><p>Without these foundations, “best of” guides become opinion pieces masquerading as authoritative recommendations—and that’s not fair to either manufacturers or consumers trying to make informed decisions.</p><p>We know that testing air quality monitors is not easy. This is why we’ve outlined proper testing methodology in our guide: <a href="https://www.airgradient.com/blog/how-to-test-an-air-quality-monitor/">How to Test an Air Quality Monitor</a>. From a publication as influential as WIRED, can we not expect a <strong>proper evaluation</strong>?</p><p>Who is the <strong>ultimate loser</strong>? <strong>The consumer</strong>. When accuracy matters for health decisions—understanding air quality affects everything from asthma management to sleep quality—flawed methodology means people miss products that might better serve their actual needs.</p><div><p><img src="https://www.airgradient.com/images/blog/posts/wired-review/wired-one.webp" alt="Forest in New Zealand." loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p><div><p>Many thanks to our designer Cid for this nice illustration!</p></div></div><h2 id="why-were-embracing-not-recommended">Why We’re Embracing “Not Recommended”</h2><p>To WIRED: don’t worry, we’re not hiring lawyers or reputation management firms to try burying this review. That’s not who we are. Instead, we’re doing something different—<strong>we’re amplifying it</strong>. We want people to see exactly what passes for “comprehensive” evaluation at your publication.</p><p>Here’s what we stand for: prioritizing sensor accuracy over marketing budgets, building products people can actually repair in a throwaway world, and being transparent about our failures while working to fix them. These are the principles that built our community of 50,000+ users.</p><p>Most companies would be celebrating a “Best Overall” rating and staying quiet about the methodology. But here’s the thing: <strong>even if we’d won, I’d still be writing this article</strong>. Poor methodology doesn’t just hurt the companies that get unfair ratings—it hurts consumers making health decisions based on flawed recommendations, and it hurts the entire industry when subjective preferences masquerade as expert evaluation.</p><blockquote><div><p>This is <strong>bigger than AirGradient</strong>. When publications with millions of readers abandon rigorous standards, they’re not just affecting one company’s sales and reputation —they’re shaping market perceptions, influencing purchasing decisions that affect people’s health, and setting a precedent that opinion journalism is acceptable where technical expertise should rule.</p></div></blockquote><p>We remain committed to what we’ve always done: building accurate, repairable, and affordable monitors through independent scientific testing and open-source transparency. We’ll keep standing by our products with comprehensive support, because that’s what our community deserves.</p><p>We’ve escalated our concerns to WIRED’s editorial leadership—not seeking special treatment or demanding apologies, but asking for the <strong>consistent, professional evaluation</strong> that consumers deserve when making decisions about their health and indoor environment. We believe in independent journalism, but independence means nothing without professional standards.</p><p>So yes, we’re <strong>embracing our “Not Recommended” rating</strong>. It’s become a badge of honor—proof that we prioritize substance over relationships, transparency over marketing polish, and community trust over media approval.</p><h2 id="what-this-means-for-all-of-us">What This Means for All of Us</h2><p>To our community: The whole AirGradient team and I appreciate your continued support through this. You’ve stood by us not because of what magazines say, but because you’ve experienced our commitment to accuracy, repairability, and transparency firsthand. That means everything.</p><p>But this experience reinforces something that goes beyond AirGradient: when influential publications abandon rigorous methodology, it creates a <strong>broken ecosystem</strong>. Manufacturers get incentivized to invest in PR relationships instead of product quality. Consumers lose access to reliable information exactly when they need it most—when making decisions about their health and indoor environment. And the companies actually doing the hard work of innovation get drowned out by those with bigger marketing budgets.</p><p>The air quality monitoring space is already confusing enough. People are trying to protect their families from pollution, manage asthma, improve sleep quality, and make informed decisions about their indoor environments. They deserve better than subjective opinion pieces dressed up as authoritative guides.</p><p>Here’s what I’m curious about: <strong>Is this the norm now?</strong> Are you seeing this same pattern across other product categories? When you’re researching purchases—whether it’s air quality monitors, smart home devices, or any technical product—what sources do you actually trust?</p><p>And specifically for situations like this: <strong>How would you want us to handle it?</strong> Should companies stay quiet when review methodology breaks down? Should we be more aggressive in calling this out? Or is transparency and open discussion the right approach?</p><p>I’m asking because this affects all of us. Every time we let poor methodology slide, we’re accepting a world where marketing budgets matter more than product quality, where personal preferences get presented as expert evaluation, and where the companies trying to do right by their communities get penalized for it.</p><p><strong>Drop a comment below</strong> or reach out directly—I read every message, and your perspectives help shape how we navigate these situations. Because at the end of the day, we’re not just building monitors; we’re trying to build a better way of doing business, and that requires all of us pushing for higher standards.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>One of the signal achievements of computing is data <em>compression</em><span><a name="3016482be788use"></a>1</span>: we take in data, make it smaller while retaining <em>all</em>
information (“lossless” compression), transmit it, and then decompress it back to the original at the
other end.</p>
<p>For many years, compression was an absolute requirement to get things done:
storage devices were too small for the data we wanted to store and networks too
slow to transmit what we wanted at an acceptable speed.</p>
<p>Today compression is less often an absolute requirement but it can still make
our lives usefully better. For example, the page you’re reading right now has,
almost certainly, arrived to you in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_compression">compressed
form</a>. It was worth my time
making this work, because my site now displays more quickly on your screen and
the load on my server is reduced.</p>
<p>All of which makes me greatly amused to see that in 2025 we are now sometimes
doing the very opposite.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple example. Bob needs a new computer for his job. In order to
obtain a new work computer he has to create a 4 paragraph business case
explaining why the new computer will improve his productivity. Creating the
necessary prose is torturous for most of us, so Bob fires up the LLM du jour,
types in “Please create a 4 paragraph long business case for my manager,
explaining why I need to replace my old, slow computer” and copies the result
into his email.</p>
<p>Bob’s manager receives 4 paragraphs of dense prose and realises from the first line
that he’s going to have to read the whole thing carefully to work out what he’s
being asked for and why. Instead, he copies the email into the LLM du jour and
types at the start “Please summarise this email for me in one sentence”. The 4
paragraphs are summarised as “The sender needs a new computer as his current one is
old and slow and makes him unproductive.” The manager approves the request.</p>
<p>I have started to refer to this pattern – which I’ve now seen happen several
times in very different contexts – as <em>LLM inflation</em>. It is very easy to use
LLMs to turn short, simple content into something long and seemingly profound — and to
use LLMs to turn long and seemingly profound content into something short and simple.</p>
<p>That we are using LLMs for inflation should not be taken as a criticism of
these wonderful tools. It might, however, make us consider <em>why</em> we find
ourselves inflating content. At best we’re implicitly rewarding obfuscation
and time wasting; at worst we’re allowing a lack of clear thinking
to be covered up. I think we’ve all known this to be true, but LLMs allow us to
see the full extent of this with our own eyes. Perhaps it will encourage us to
change!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Readers may recall that Japan recently passed the <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/japan-ends-the-apple-browser-ban/">Smartphone Act</a>, officially the <em>Bill on the Promotion of Competition for Specified Software Used in Smartphones</em>. Among its most important reforms is a direct prohibition on Apple’s long-standing ban on third-party browser engines on iOS.</p>
<p>This ban has functioned as an <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/walled-gardens-report/#apple-has-effectively-banned-all-third-party-browsers">effective ban on browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave &amp; Vivaldi</a>, by forcing them to use Apple’s WebKit engine, which they cannot modify or control. This results in no effective browser competition on iOS, and web apps being deprived of the APIs and performance they need to compete with native apps.</p>
<p>The legislation was based on the <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/digitalmarket/pdf_e/documents_230616.pdf">Final Report by Japan’s Headquarters for Digital Market Competition</a>, a report Open Web Advocacy consulted on. <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/files/OWA%20-%20HDMC%20(Japan)%20-%20Competition%20in%20the%20Mobile%20App%20Ecosystem%20-%20v1.1.pdf">Our submission is available here</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, Japan published the <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.jftc.go.jp/file/MSCA_Guidelines_tentative_translation.pdf">Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA) Guidelines</a>. These subordinate rules clarify how the Act will be interpreted and enforced. Here's what they mean for browser competition.</p>
<h2 id="ban-on-blocking-or-hindering-alternative-browser-engines" tabindex="-1"> Ban on Blocking or Hindering Alternative Browser Engines</h2>
<p>The guidelines explicitly prohibit any measures that would prevent or hinder the adoption of third-party browser engines:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Actions that "Prevent" the Adoption of Alternative Browser Engines"</strong></p><p>
Such actions may include: imposing unreasonable technical restrictions on individual app providers while allowing them to adopt alternative browser engines, placing excessive financial burdens on individual app providers for adopting alternative browser engines, and steering smartphone users away from using individual software that incorporates alternative browser engines.</p><p>
The determination of whether a designated provider's action constitutes "preventing" the adoption of alternative browser engines <span><strong>does not require that it be completely impossible for individual app providers to adopt alternative browser engines</strong></span>. Instead, the determination is made based <strong>on the degree of likelihood that such a result will occur.</strong><br>
<cite><a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.jftc.go.jp/file/MSCA_Guidelines_tentative_translation.pdf">Mobile Software Competition Act Guidelines</a><br>
(emphasis added)</cite></p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>This clause is crucial. It means that designated providers (i.e. Apple) must not only eliminate outright bans (like <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#:~:text=Apps%20that%20browse%20the%20web%20must%20use%20the%20appropriate%20WebKit%20framework%20and%20WebKit%20JavaScript.">App Store Guideline 2.5.6</a>), but must also refrain from practices that, while technically permitting browser engines, <strong>render their use impractical or commercially unviable</strong>.</p>
<p>This is directly relevant to Apple’s current iOS behavior, even under the EU’s Digital Markets Act, where <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/apples-browser-engine-ban-persists-even-under-the-dma/">technical and procedural restrictions continue to block meaningful competition</a>. Japan’s guidance is clearly designed to avoid similar outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="api-access-must-be-functionally-equivalent" tabindex="-1"> API Access Must Be Functionally Equivalent</h2>
<p>The MSCA also mandates fair access to OS APIs, mirroring Article 6(7) of the EU DMA. For browsers this is particularly critical as they need extensive access to a broad range of APIs typically reserved for Safari and WebKit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Article 7, Item 2 of this Act prohibits designated providers of basic operation software from preventing other businesses (businesses other than designated providers, etc.) from using OS functions with equivalent performance for the provision of individual software, when such OS functions are used by the designated provider, etc., to provide individual software. <strong>By prohibiting actions that prevent other businesses from using OS functions with equivalent performance as utilized by designated providers</strong>, etc., for the provision of individual software, this Item aims to promote competition regarding individual software.<br>
<cite><a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.jftc.go.jp/file/MSCA_Guidelines_tentative_translation.pdf">Mobile Software Competition Act Guidelines</a><br>
(emphasis added)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The act does specify that alternative APIs are allowed. However it clarifies that they may not be materially inferior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, for example, if other businesses are allowed to use that OS function for individual software provision using a technical method different from that used by designated providers, etc., <strong>but the performance is materially inferior to that when designated providers</strong>, etc., use that OS function for individual software provision, it does not constitute "other businesses using the equivalent performance to provide individual software".<br>
<cite><a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.jftc.go.jp/file/MSCA_Guidelines_tentative_translation.pdf">Mobile Software Competition Act Guidelines</a><br>
(emphasis added)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="choice-screens" tabindex="-1"> Choice Screens</h2>
<p>The act also mandates choice screens for browsers among other items. Importantly it specifies that the choice screen must display “<em>Promptly after the first activation",</em> an important improvement on the EU’s Digital Markets Act.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that smartphone users must be made to select a specific individual software from the options displayed on the choice screen promptly after the first activation of the smartphone by the user. <strong>"Promptly after the first activation"</strong> refers to, for example, <strong>displaying the choice screen at the time of initial setup after the first activation of the smartphone</strong>, or displaying the choice screen at the time of the first launch of the individual software subject to the choice screen, and making users select a specific individual software from the options.<br>
<cite><a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.jftc.go.jp/file/MSCA_Guidelines_tentative_translation.pdf">Mobile Software Competition Act Guidelines</a><br>
(emphasis added)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-happens-next%3F" tabindex="-1"> What Happens Next?</h2>
<p>The Mobile Software Competition Act is expected to come <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://globalcompetitionreview.com/review/the-asia-pacific-antitrust-review/2025/article/japan-authorities-prepare-use-bolstered-anti-monopoly-framework-scrutinise-digital-sector#:~:text=The%20Mobile%20Software%20Competition%20Act%20is%20expected%20to%20come%20into%20force%20by%20December%202025.">into force by December 2025</a>. With Japan joining the EU and UK, there are now three jurisdictions where Apple will be required to permit browsers to run their own engines. As Japan prepares for enforcement, it is likely studying the regulatory approaches and challenges already unfolding in Europe and the UK.</p>
<p>As the EU and UK have already shown (<a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/uk-regulators-final-verdict--apples-browser-engine-ban-harms-competition/">UK MIR</a>, <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/uk-launches-investigation-into-apple-and-google-under-dmcc/">CMA SMS case</a>, <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/apples-browser-engine-ban-persists-even-under-the-dma/">EU DMA enforcement</a>), enforcement will be a long and difficult process.</p>
<p>Now that Japan, the EU, and the UK all require Apple to support third-party browser engines, 2026 may become the decisive year in restoring browser competition on iOS. But much depends on regulators’ resolve, and on Apple’s willingness to comply in substance, not just form.</p>
<p>We’d like to extend our gratitude to the extensive work over many years by the <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/digitalmarket/index_e.html">HDMC</a>, <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.jftc.go.jp/en/">JFTC</a> and others in improving browser, browser engine and web app competition.</p>

Antonio Cuni, who
is a longtime Python performance engineer and <a href="https://pypy.org/">PyPy</a> developer, gave a presentation at <a href="https://ep2025.europython.eu/">EuroPython
2025</a> about "Myths and fairy tales around Python performance" on
the first day of the conference in Prague.  As might be guessed from the
title, he thinks that much of the conventional wisdom about Python
performance is misleading at best.  With lots of examples, he showed where
the real problems that he sees lie.  He has come to the conclusion that memory
management will ultimately limit what can be done about Python performance,
but he has an
early-stage project called <a href="https://github.com/spylang/spy?tab=readme-ov-file#spy">SPy</a> that
might be a way toward a super-fast Python.
</p>

<p>
He started by asking the audience to raise their hands if they thought
"<q>Python is slow or not fast enough</q>"; lots of hands went up, which
was rather different than when he gave the presentation at PyCon Italy,
where almost no one raised their hand. "<q>Very different audience</q>", he
said with a smile.  He has been working on Python performance for many
years, has talked with many Python developers, and heard some persistent
myths, which he would like to try to dispel.
</p>

<h4>Myths</h4>

<p>
The first is that "<q>Python is not slow</q>"; based on the raised hands,
though, he thought that most attendees already knew that was a myth.  These
days, he hears developers say that Python speed doesn't really matter,
because it is a glue language; "<q>nowadays only the GPU matters</q>", so
Python is fast enough.  Python <i>is</i> fast enough for some tasks, he
said, which is why there are so many people using it and attending
conferences like EuroPython.
</p>

<p>
There is a set of programs where Python is fast enough, but that set does
not hold all of the Python programs in use—it is only a subset.  The
programs that need more Python performance are what is driving all of the
different efforts to optimize the interpreter, but are also causing
developers to constantly work to improve the performance of their programs, often by using <a href="https://cython.org/">Cython</a>, <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/">Numba</a>, and the like.
</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1032100/">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/europy-cuni-sm.png" alt="[Antonio Cuni]" title="Antonio Cuni" width="220" height="280">
</a></p><p>
In his <a href="https://antocuni.eu/talk/2025/07/europython-myths-and-fairy-tales/">slides</a>,
he represented the two sets as circles, with "programs where Python is fast
enough" fully inside "Python programs"; he then added the set of "all
possible programs" fully encompassing the other two.  In his ideal world,
all possible programs would be able to be written with Python; currently,
programs that need all of the performance of the processor cannot use
Python.  He would like to see the inner circles grow so that Python can
be used in more programs.
</p>

<p>
The corollary of the "it's just a glue language" statement is that you
"just need to rewrite the hot parts in <span>C/C++</span>", though that is a little out
of date; "<q>nowadays they say that we should rewrite it in Rust</q>".
That is "<q>not completely false</q>", it is a good technique to speed up
your code, but soon enough it will "<q>hit a wall</q>".  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto
principle</a>—described with a slide created by ChatGPT for unclear
reasons—says that 80% of the time will be spent in 20% of the code.  So
optimizing that 20% will help.
</p>

<p>
But the program will then run into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl's law</a>, which
says that the improvement for optimizing one part of the code is limited by
the time spent in the now-optimized code;
"<q>what was the hot part now is very very fast and then you need to
optimize everything else</q>".  He showed a diagram where some
<tt>inner()</tt> function was taking 80% of the time; if that gets reduced
to, say, 10% of what it was, the rest of the program now dominates the run
time. 
</p>

<p>
Another "myth" is that Python is slow because it is interpreted; again,
there is some truth to that, but interpretation is only a small part of
what makes Python slow.  He gave the example of a simple Python
expression:
</p><pre>    p.x * 2
</pre><p>
A compiler for C/C++/Rust could turn that kind of expression into three
operations: load the value of </p><tt>x</tt><p>, multiply it by two, and then
store the result.  In Python, however, there is a long list of operations
that have to be performed, starting with finding the type of </p><tt>p</tt><p>,
calling its </p><tt>__getattribute__()</tt><p> method, through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_(computer_programming)">unboxing</a></p><tt>p.x</tt><p> and </p><tt>2</tt><p>, to finally boxing the result, which requires
memory allocation.  None of that is dependent on whether Python is
interpreted or not, those steps are required based on the language
semantics.
</p>

<h4>Static types</h4>

<p>
Now people are using static types in Python, so he hears people say that
compilers for the language can now skip past all of those steps and
simply do the operation directly.  He put up an example:
</p><pre>    def add(x: int, y: int) -&gt; int:
        return x + y

    print(add(2, 3))
</pre><p>
But static typing is not enforced at run time, so there are various ways to
call </p><tt>add()</tt><p> with non-integers, for example:
</p><pre>    print(add('hello ', 'world')) # type: ignore
</pre><p>
That is perfectly valid code and the type-checker is happy because of the
comment, but string addition is not the same as for integers.  The
static types "<q>are completely useless from the point of view of
optimization and performance</q>".  Beyond that, the following is legal
Python too:
</p><pre>    class MyClass:
        def __add__(self, other):
            ...

    def foo(x: MyClass, y: MyClass) -&gt; MyClass:
        return x + y

    del MyClass.__add__
</pre><p>
"<q>Static compilation of Python is problematic because everything can
change</q>", he said.
</p>

<p>
So, maybe, "<q>a JIT compiler can solve all of your problems</q>"; they can
go a long way toward making Python, or any dynamic language, faster, Cuni
said.  But that leads to "<q>a more subtle problem</q>".  He put up a slide
with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilemma">trilemma</a>
triangle: a dynamic language, speed, or a simple implementation.
You can have two of those, but not all three.
</p>

<p>
Python has historically favored a dynamic, simply implemented language, but
it is moving toward a dynamic, fast language with projects like the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1029307/">CPython JIT compiler</a>.  That loses the simple
implementation, but he does not have to care "<q>because there are people
in the front row doing it for me</q>", he said with a grin.
</p>

<p>
In practice, though, it becomes hard to predict performance with a JIT.
Based on his experience with PyPy, and as a consultant improving Python
performance for customers, it is necessary to think about what the JIT will
do in order to get the best performance.  That is a complex and error-prone
process; he found situations where he was "<q>unable to trigger
optimizations in PyPy's compiler because the code was too complicated</q>".
</p>

<p>
All of this leads to what he calls "<q>optimization chasing</q>".  It
starts with a slow program that gets its fast path optimized, which results
in a faster program and everyone is happy.  Then they start to rely on that
extra speed, which can suddenly disappear with a seemingly unrelated change
somewhere in the program.  His favorite example is a program that was
running on PyPy (using Python 2) and suddenly got 10x slower; it turned out
that a Unicode key was being used in a dictionary of strings
that led the JIT to de-optimize the code so that everything got much
slower.
</p>

<h4>Dynamic</h4>

<p>
He put up some code that did not really do anything exciting or useful, he
said, but did demonstrate some of the problems that Python compilers
encounter: 
</p><pre>    import numpy as np

    N = 10

    def calc(v: np.ndarray[float], k: float) -&gt; float:
        return (v * k).sum() + N
</pre><p>
The compiler really can assume nothing from that code.  Seemingly, it
imports <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> in the usual way, the
</p><tt>calc()</tt><p> function multiplies each element of the </p><tt>v</tt><p> array by
</p><tt>k</tt><p>, adds them all up with </p><tt>sum()</tt><p> and then adds the constant
</p><tt>N</tt><p> to that.  First off, the </p><tt>import</tt><p> may not bring in NumPy
at all; there could be some import hook somewhere that does something
completely unexpected.  </p><tt>N</tt><p> cannot be assumed to be ten, because
that could be changed elsewhere in the code; as with the earlier
</p><tt>add()</tt><p> function, the type declarations on </p><tt>calc()</tt><p> are not
ironclad either.
</p>

<p>
But, in almost all cases, that code would do exactly what it looks like it
does.  Developers rarely do these kinds of things that the language would
allow, but the
gap between the way programmers normally write Python and the definition of
the language is what "<q>makes life complicated for the interpreter</q>".
In practice, a lot of what Python allows does not actually happen.
</p>

<p>
It is the extremely dynamic nature of the language that makes it slow,
"<q>but at the same time it's what makes Python very nice</q>".  The
dynamic features are not needed 99% of the time, Cuni said, but "<q>in that
1% are what you need to make Python awesome</q>".  Libraries often use
patterns that rely on the dynamic nature of the language in order to make
APIs "<q>that end users can use nicely</q>" so those features cannot simply
be removed.
</p>

<h4>Game</h4>

<p>
The "compiler game" was up next; he progressively showed some code snippets
to point out how little a compiler can actually "know" about the code.
This code might seem like it should give an error of some sort:
</p><pre>    class Point:
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y

    def foo(p: Point):
        assert isinstance(p, Point)
        print(p.name) # ???
</pre><p>
Inside </p><tt>foo()</tt><p>, the compiler knows that </p><tt>p</tt><p> is a
</p><tt>Point</tt><p>, which has no </p><tt>name</tt><p> attribute.  But, of course,
Python is a dynamic language:
</p><pre>    def bar():
        p = Point(1, 2)
        p.name = 'P0'
        foo(p)
</pre><p>
Meanwhile, here is an example where the compiler cannot even assume that
the method exists:
</p><pre>    import random

    class Evil:
        if random.random() &gt; 0.5:
            def hello(self):
                print('hello world')

    Evil().hello() # 🤷🏻‍♂️
</pre><p>
Legal Python, but "<q>this is not something to define in production, I
hope</q>", he said with a laugh.  "<q>Half of the time it still works, half
of the time
it raises an exception. Good luck compiling it.</q>"
</p>

<p>
In another example, he showed a function:
</p><pre>    def foo():
        p = Person('Alice', 16)
        print(p.name, p.age)
        assert isinstance(p, Person) # &lt;&lt;&lt;
</pre><p>
The </p><tt>Person</tt><p> class was not shown (yet), but there was an empty class
(just "</p><tt>pass</tt><p>") called </p><tt>Student</tt><p>.  In this case, the
</p><tt>assert</tt><p> will fail, because of the definition of </p><tt>Person</tt><p>:
</p><pre>    class Person:
        def __new__(cls, name, age):
            if age &lt; 18:
                p = object.__new__(Student)
            else:
                p = object.__new__(Person)
            p.name = name
            p.age = age
            return p
</pre><p>
"<q>You can have a class with a dunder-new [i.e. <tt>__new__()</tt>], which
returns something which is unrelated and is not an instance of the class.
Good luck optimizing that.</q>"
</p>

<p>
The final entrant in the game was the following:
</p><pre>    N = 10

    @magic
    def foo():
       return N
</pre><p>
He "de-sugared" the </p><tt>@magic</tt><p> decorator and added some assertions:
</p><pre>    def foo():
       return N

    bar = magic(foo)

    assert foo.__code__ == bar.__code__
    assert bar.__module__ == '__main__'
    assert bar.__closure__ is None

    assert foo() == 10
    assert bar() == 20 # 🤯😱
</pre><p>
The code object for </p><tt>foo()</tt><p> and </p><tt>bar()</tt><p> are the same, but
they give different results.  As might be guessed, the value of </p><tt>N</tt><p>
has been changed by </p><tt>magic()</tt><p>; the code is as follows:
</p><pre>    def rebind_globals(func, newglobals):
        newfunc = types.FunctionType(
            func.__code__,
            newglobals,
            func.__name__,
            func.__defaults__,
            func.__closure__)
        newfunc.__module__ = func.__module__
        return newfunc

    def magic(fn):
        return rebind_globals(fn, {'N': 20})
</pre><p>
That returns a version of the function (</p><tt>foo()</tt><p> was passed) that has
a different view of the values of the global variables.  That may seem like
a far-fetched example, but he wrote <a href="https://github.com/pdbpp/pdbpp/blob/master/src/pdbpp.py#L114-L134">code
much like that</a> for the <a href="https://github.com/pdbpp/pdbpp/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#pdb-a-drop-in-replacement-for-pdb">pdb++
Python debugger</a> many years ago. "<q>I claim I had good reason to do
that</q>", he said with a chuckle.
</p>

<h4>Abstraction</h4>

<p>
So there are parts of the language that need to be accounted for, as he
showed in the game, but there is a more fundamental problem: "<q>in Python,
abstractions are not free</q>".  When code is written, developers want
performance, but they also want the code to be understandable and
maintainable. That comes at a cost.  He started with a simple function:
</p><pre>    def algo(points: list[tuple[float, float]]):
        res = 0
        for x, y in points:
            res += x**2 * y + 10
        return
</pre><p>
It takes a list of points, each represented as a tuple of floating-point
numbers, and performs a calculation using them.
Then he factored out the calculation into its own function:
</p><pre>    def fn(x, y):
        return x**2 * y + 10
</pre><p>
That is already slower than the original, because there 
is overhead for calling a function: the function has to be looked up, a
frame object has to be created, and so on.  A JIT compiler can help, but it
will still have more overhead.  He took things one step further by
switching to a </p><tt>Point</tt><p> data class:
</p><pre>    @dataclass
    class Point:
        x: float
        y: float

    def fn(p):
        return p.x**2 * p.y + 10

    def algo(items: list[Point]):
        res = 0
        for p in items:
            res += fn(p)
        return
</pre><p>
That, of course, slows it down even further.  This is a contrived example,
Cuni said, but the idea is that every abstraction has a cost, "<q>and then
you end up with a program that is very slow</q>".  It was an example of
what he calls "Python to Python" abstraction, where the code is being
refactored strictly within the language.
</p>

<p>
A "Python to C" abstraction, where the hot parts of the code are factored
out into C or some other compiled language, also suffers from added costs.
One could imagine that Python implementations get more and more
optimizations such that the list of <tt>Point</tt> objects is represented
in a simple linear array of floating-point numbers, without boxing, but if
<tt>fn()</tt> is written for Python's C API, those numbers will need to be
boxed and unboxed (in both directions), which is completely wasted work.
It is "<q>unavoidable with the current C API</q>".  One of the ways to
speed up programs that were running under PyPy was to remove the C code and
perform the calculations directly in Python, which PyPy could optimize
well.
</p>

<h4>An elephant</h4>

<p>
There is an elephant in the room, however, with regard to Python
performance, though it is one he rarely hears about: memory management.  In
today's hardware, "<q>computation is very cheap</q>", but memory is the
bottleneck.   If the data is in a cache at any level, accessing it is
inexpensive, but RAM accesses are quite slow.  "<q>Generally speaking, if
you want to have very very good performance, we should avoid cache misses
as much as possible.</q>"
</p>

<p>
But Python is prone to having a memory layout that is cache-unfriendly.  He
showed a simple example:
</p><pre>    class Person:
        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age

    p = [Person('Alice', 16), Person('Bob', 21)]
</pre><p>
Each </p><tt>Person</tt><p> has two fields, which ideally would be placed together
in memory, and the two objects in the list would also be placed together,
for a cache-friendly layout.  In practice, though, those objects are all
scattered throughout memory; he showed a <a href="https://pythontutor.com/render.html#code=class%20Person%3A%0A%20%20%20%20def%20__init__%28self,%20name,%20age%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20self.name%20%3D%20name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20self.age%20%3D%20age%0A%20%20%20%20%0Ap%20%3D%20%5BPerson%28'Alice',%2016%29,%20Person%28'Bob',%2021%29%5D%0Adel%20Person&amp;cumulative=false&amp;curInstr=11&amp;heapPrimitives=true&amp;mode=display&amp;origin=opt-frontend.js&amp;py=3&amp;rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&amp;textReferences=false">visualization from
Python Tutor</a>.  Each arrow represented a pointer that needed to be
followed, thus a potential cache miss; there were nearly a dozen arrows for
this simple data structure.
</p>

<p>
"<q>This is something you cannot just solve with a JIT compiler; it's
impossible to solve it without changing semantics.</q>" Python is
inherently cache-unfriendly, he said, "<q>and I honestly don't know how to
solve this problem</q>".  His "sad truth" conclusion is that "<q>Python
cannot be super-fast</q>" without breaking compatibility.  Some of the
dynamic features ("<q>let's call it
craziness</q>")  he had described in the talk will eventually hamper performance improvements. "<q>If we
want to keep this craziness, well, we have to leave some performance on the
table.</q>"
</p>

<p>
His next slide was "The end", complete with emojis of sadness ("😢💔🥹"),
which is where he ended the talk when he gave it at PyCon Italy a year
earlier.  This time, though, he wanted to "<q>give a little hope</q>" so he
added a question mark, then reiterated that without breaking
compatibility Python could not get super-fast.
</p>

<p>
He has a proposal for the community if it decides that Python should try to
reach top-level performance, which he hopes the community does, but
"<q>it's fine to say 'no'</q>".  He suggests tweaking the language
semantics by keeping the dynamic features where they are actually useful,
perhaps by limiting the kinds of dynamic changes that can be made to
specific points in time, so that compilers can depend on certain behavior
and structure.  "<q>Not to allow the world to change at any point in
time as it is now.</q>"
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the type system should be revamped with an eye on performance.
Currently, the types are optional and not enforced, so they cannot be
used for optimizations.  The intent would be that performance-oriented code
could be written in Python, not in some other language called from Python.
But, for cases where calling another language is still desirable, the
extra cost (e.g. boxing) of doing so should be removed. "<q>Most
importantly, we want something which stays Pythonic, because we like this
language or we wouldn't be here.</q>"
</p>

<p>
Cuni said that he has a potential solution, "<q>which is not to make Python
faster</q>", because he claims that is not possible. SPy, which stands for
"Static Python", is a project he started a few years ago to address the
performance problems.  All of the standard disclaimers apply to SPy, it is
"<q>a work in progress, research and development, [and] we don't know where it
will go</q>".  The best information can be found on the GitHub page linked
above or in his <a href="https://antocuni.eu/2025/05/31/spy--pycon-it-2025/">talk on SPy at PyCon
Italy</a> in late May.
</p>

<p>
He showed a quick <a href="https://antocuni.pyscriptapps.com/sobel/latest/">demo</a> of doing
realtime edge detection from a camera; it ran in the browser using <a href="https://pyscript.net/">PyScript</a>.  The demo shows the raw camera
feed on the left
and, at first, edge detection being run in NumPy on the right; NumPy
achieves fewer than two frames per second (fps).  Switching to a SPy-based
edge-detection algorithm makes the right-hand image keep up with the
camera, running at around 60fps.  The <a href="https://github.com/spylang/demos/tree/main/sobel">code for the
demo</a> is available on GitHub as well.
</p>

<p>
He recommended the SPy repository and its issue tracker in particular for
interested attendees; some issues have been tagged as "good first issue"
and "help wanted".  There is also a <a href="https://discord.com/invite/wRb29FGZpP">Discord server</a> for
chatting about the project. Before too long, a video of the talk should
appear on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EuroPythonConference">EuroPython YouTube channel</a>.

                    <p><time datetime="2025-07-03">2025-07-03</time></p>
                    <p>In October 2024, Anthropic released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODaHJzOyVCQ">"Claude
                            Computer Use"</a>. It allows an AI to control a computer and for example copy data from a
                        browser to a spreadsheet. It's a really cool feature and since I am the maintainer of a library
                        that allows controlling a computer, I was curious to find out how they do it and learn from
                        them. I didn't have time to look into it until this spring. Anthropic is one of the leaders in
                        AI and was <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-e-at-usd61-5b-post-money-valuation">valued
                            at a cool 60+ billion dollars</a> in March 2025, so I was surprised to learn that
                        Anthropic is actually using my library <a href="https://crates.io/crates/enigo">enigo</a> for
                        it.</p>

                    <figure>
                        <picture>
                            <img src="https://grell.dev/assets/img/blinking.webp" alt="My reaction to the finding represented by the 'white guy blinking' meme." fetchpriority="high">

                    </figure>

                    <p>You can confirm that enigo is used in Claude Desktop for macOS by running the following two
                        commands:</p>

                    <pre><code><span>$ 7z x Claude.dmg</span>
<span>$ perl -nle 'print $&amp; while /.{0,67}enigo.{0,30}/g' Claude/Claude.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/claude-native/claude-native-binding.node</span>
<span>/Users/runner/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/enigo-0.2.1/src/macos/macos_impl.rs</span>
<span>/Users/runner/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/enigo-0.2.1/src/macos/macos_impl.rs</span></code></pre>

                    <p>It is also used in Claude Desktop for Windows. You can confirm it by running:</p>

                    <pre><code><span>$ 7z x Claude-Setup-x64.exe</span>
<span>$ 7z x AnthropicClaude-0.11.6-full.nupkg</span>
<span>$ perl -nle 'print $&amp; while /.{0,75}enigo.{0,26}/g' Claude-Setup-x64/AnthropicClaude-0.11.6-full/lib/net45/resources/app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/claude-native/claude-native-binding.node</span>
<span>C:\Users\runneradmin\.cargo\registry\src\index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f\enigo-0.2.1\src\win\win_impl.rs</span></code></pre>


                    <p>In the output, you can see that on both platforms <a href="https://crates.io/crates/enigo/0.2.1">enigo version
                            0.2.1</a> is used (you might have to scroll right to see it).</p>

                    <p>I am very proud that enigo matured enough for a company with a seemingly infinite development
                        budget to choose it for their commercial project. Input simulation is surprisingly difficult due
                        to little documentation
                        and a lot of OS-specific quirks and warrants its own blog post. In my (admittedly not
                        completely
                        objective) opinion enigo is a great
                        choice for the job. As far as I know, it is the only library that works on Windows, macOS,
                        *BSD and Linux (Wayland, X11 and libei) without root. It is written in Rust and thus is mostly
                        memory safe
                        while being very fast. It is the most popular choice on crates.io
                        with almost 300,000 downloads and 1,200+ stars on Github. And yet it makes me a little nervous
                        knowing that my hobby project is used by Claude Desktop and deployed to thousands of devices.
                    </p>


                    <p>If you're not familiar with open-source software, you might wonder how much money I made from
                        them — and how many Ferraris I’m going to buy. If you <em>are</em>
                        familiar with
                        open-source software, it will come as no surprise to you that I am not earning any money from
                        it.
                        enigo is published under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT
                            license</a>. That means everyone can use it free of charge. The only thing I
                        get in return is more stars on GitHub and higher download counts on crates.io (the nerd
                        equivalent of street creds).</p>

                    <p>Interestingly, although Claude Desktop is an Electron app, it's only available on
                        macOS and Windows. The benefit of Electron applications is that they work on all platforms.
                        Other people found ways to run Claude Desktop on Linux as well (<a href="https://github.com/k3d3/claude-desktop-linux-flake">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian">2</a>, <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/claude-desktop-bin">3</a>). They had to replace the
                        code that uses enigo with stubs. This is very curious, because enigo is also cross-platform.</p>

                    <p>Through a friend of a friend, I found out that Anthropic had an open position in the team
                        implementing the secret, unreleased feature of Claude Desktop using enigo. I wrote a cover
                        letter and sent out my application. An automatic reply informed me that they might take some
                        time to respond and that they only notify applicants if they made it to the next round. After a
                        few weeks without an answer, I had assumed they chose other applicants. I already forgot about
                        the
                        application when I received an e-mail from Anthropic. I excitedly opened it. Unfortunately they
                        thanked me for my application but said the team doesn't have the capacity to review additional
                        applications.</p>

                    <p>I would have loved working at Anthropic, implementing a feature similar to Computer Use and
                        bringing Claude Desktop to Linux. I thought I had a pretty good shot to get the position,
                        considering some of my code is already
                        part of their software. Through the years I accumulated a lot of knowledge in the niche that is
                        input simulation that I would have brought to the table. Working full-time on enigo for a few
                        months could lift the project to a whole different level of polish and professionalism and would
                        have helped Anthropic to be able to focus on their AI models and not input quirks.
                    </p>

  <h2>Rethinking DOM from first principles</h2>
</p></div>



<img src="https://acko.net/files/dom-cruft-2025/cover.jpg" alt="Cover Image">

<div>

<p>Browsers are in a very weird place. While WebAssembly has succeeded, even on the server, the client still feels largely the same as it did <a href="https://acko.net/blog/shadow-dom/" target="_blank">10 years ago</a>.</p>

<p>Enthusiasts will tell you that accessing native web APIs via WASM is a solved problem, with some <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3746174" target="_blank">minimal JS glue</a>.</p>

<p>But the question not asked is why you would want to access the DOM. It's just the only option. So I'd like to explain why it really is time to send the DOM and its assorted APIs off to a farm somewhere, with some ideas on&nbsp;how.</p>

<p>I won't pretend to know everything about browsers. Nobody knows everything anymore, and that's the problem.</p>

</div>



<p><img src="https://acko.net/files/dom-cruft-2025/netscape-upside-down.jpg" alt="Netscape or something">
</p>



<div>

<h2>The 'Document' Model</h2>

<p>Few know how bad the DOM really is. In Chrome, <code>document.body</code> now has 350+ keys, grouped roughly like this:</p>

</div>

<div>
  <p><img src="https://acko.net/files/dom-cruft-2025/document-body-chart.png" alt="document.body properties"></p>
</div>

<div>

<p>This doesn't include the CSS properties in <code>document.body.style</code> of which there are... <b>660</b>.</p>

<p>The boundary between properties and methods is very vague. Many are just facades with an invisible setter behind them. Some getters may trigger a just-in-time re-layout. There's ancient legacy stuff, like all the <code>onevent</code> properties nobody uses anymore.</p>

<p>The DOM is not lean and continues to get fatter. Whether you notice this largely depends on whether you are making web pages or web applications.</p>

<p>Most devs now avoid working with the DOM directly, though occasionally some purist will praise pure DOM as being superior to the various JS component/templating frameworks. What little declarative facilities the DOM has, like <code>innerHTML</code>, do not resemble modern UI patterns at all. The DOM has too many ways to do the same thing, none of them nice.</p>




<pre><code>connectedCallback() {
  const
    shadow = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'closed' }),
    template = document.getElementById('hello-world')
      .content.cloneNode(true),
    hwMsg = `Hello ${ this.name }`;

  Array.from(template.querySelectorAll('.hw-text'))
    .forEach(n =&gt; n.textContent = hwMsg);

  shadow.append(template);
}
</code></pre>


<p>Web Components deserve a mention, being the web-native equivalent of JS component libraries. But they came too late and are unpopular. The API seems clunky, with its Shadow DOM introducing new nesting and scoping layers. Proponents kinda <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/web-components/" target="_blank">read like apologetics</a>.</p>

<p>The achilles heel is the DOM's SGML/XML heritage, making everything stringly typed. React-likes do not have this problem, their syntax only <i>looks</i> like XML. Devs have learned not to keep state in the document, because it's inadequate for it.</p>

</div>

  <p><img src="https://acko.net/files/dom-cruft-2025/whatwg.png" alt="WHATWG logo"></p>
</div>

<div>

<p>For HTML itself, there isn't much to critique because nothing has changed in 10-15 years. Only <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA" target="_blank">ARIA</a> (accessibility) is notable, and only because this was what Semantic HTML was supposed to do and didn't.</p>

<p>Semantic HTML never quite reached its goal. Despite dating from around 2011, there is e.g. no <code>&lt;thread&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;comment&gt;</code> tag, when those were well-established idioms. Instead, an article inside an article <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-author-20110809/the-article-element.html" target="_blank">is probably</a> a comment. The guidelines are... weird.</p>

<p>There's this feeling that HTML always had paper-envy, and couldn't quite embrace or fully define its hypertext nature, and did not trust its users to follow clear rules.</p>

<p>Stewardship of HTML has since firmly passed to WHATWG, really the browser vendors, who have not been able to define anything more concrete as a vision, and have instead just added epicycles at the margins.</p>

<p>Along the way even CSS has grown expressions, because every templating language wants to become a programming language.</p>

</div>



<p><img src="https://acko.net/files/dom-cruft-2025/composer.gif" alt="netscape composer">
</p>



<div><p>Editability of HTML remains a sad footnote. While technically supported via <code>contentEditable</code>, actually wrangling this feature into something usable for applications is a dark art. I'm sure the Google Docs and Notion people have horror&nbsp;stories.</p></div>

<div>

<p>Nobody really believes in the old gods of progressive enhancement and separating markup from style anymore, not if they make apps.</p>

<p>Most of the applications you see nowadays will kitbash HTML/CSS/SVG into a pretty enough shape. But this comes with immense overhead, and is looking more and more like the opposite of a decent UI toolkit.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div>

<p>Lists and tables must be virtualized by hand, taking over for layout, resizing, dragging, and so on. Making a chat window's scrollbar stick to the bottom is somebody's TODO, every single time. And the more you virtualize, the more you have to reinvent find-in-page, right-click menus, etc.</p>

<p>The web blurred the distinction between UI and fluid content, which was novel at the time. But it makes less and less sense, because the UI part is a decade obsolete, and the content has largely homogenized.</p>

</div>




<p><img src="https://acko.net/files/dom-cruft-2025/css-is-awesome.jpg" alt="'css is awesome' mug, truncated layout">
</p>

<div>

<h2>CSS is inside-out</h2>

<p>CSS doesn't have a stellar reputation either, but few can put their finger on exactly&nbsp;why.</p>

<p>Where most people go wrong is to start with the wrong mental model, approaching it like a constraint solver. This is easy to show with e.g.:</p>

</div>

<div>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div style="height: 50%"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style="height: 50%"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

</div>




<div>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div style="height: 100%"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style="height: 100%"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

</div>



<div>

<p>The first might seem reasonable: divide the parent into two halves vertically. But what about the second?</p>

<p>Viewed as a set of constraints, it's contradictory, because the parent div is twice as tall as... itself. What will happen instead in <i>both cases</i> is the <code>height</code> is ignored. The parent height is unknown and CSS doesn't backtrack or iterate here. It just shrink-wraps the contents.</p>

<p>If you set e.g. <code>height: 300px</code> on the parent, then it works, but the latter case will still just spill out.</p>

</div>

<div>
<p><img src="https://acko.net/files/dom-cruft-2025/layout-modes.png" alt="Outside-in vs inside-out layout"></p>
<p><i>Outside-in and inside-out layout modes</i></p>
</div>

<div>

<p>Instead, your mental model of CSS should be applying two passes of constraints, first going outside-in, and then inside-out.</p>

<p>When you make an application frame, this is <i>outside-in</i>: the available space is divided, and the content inside does not affect sizing of panels.</p>

<p>When paragraphs stack on a page, this is <i>inside-out</i>: the text stretches out its containing parent. This is what HTML wants to do naturally.</p>

<p>By being structured this way, CSS layouts are computationally pretty simple. You can propagate the parent constraints down to the children, and then gather up the children's sizes in the other direction. This is attractive and allows webpages to scale well in terms of elements and text content.</p>

<p>CSS is always inside-out by default, reflecting its document-oriented nature. The outside-in is not obvious, because it's up to you to pass all the constraints down, starting with <code>body { height: 100%; }</code>. This is why they always say vertical alignment in CSS is hard.</p>


</div>

<div>
<p><img src="https://acko.net/files/dom-cruft-2025/flex.png" alt="Flex grow/shrink"></p>
<p><i>Use flex grow and shrink for spill-free auto-layouts with completely reasonable gaps</i></p>
</div>

<div>

<p>The scenario above is better handled with a CSS3 flex box (<code>display: flex</code>), which provides explicit control over how space is divided.</p>

<p>Unfortunately flexing muddles the simple CSS model. To auto-flex, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#algo-main-item" target="_blank">layout algorithm</a> must measure the "natural size" of every child. This means laying it out twice: first speculatively, as if floating in aether, and then again after growing or shrinking to fit:</p>

</div>

<div><p><img src="https://acko.net/files/dom-cruft-2025/speculative-layout.png" alt="Flex speculative layout"></p></div>

<div>

<p>This sounds reasonable but can come with hidden surprises, because it's recursive. Doing speculative layout of a parent often requires <i>full</i> layout of unsized children. e.g. to know how text will wrap. If you nest it right, it could in theory cause an exponential blow up, though I've never heard of it being an issue.</p>

<p>Instead you will only discover this when someone drops some large content in somewhere, and suddenly everything gets stretched out of whack. It's the opposite of the problem on the mug.</p>

<p>To avoid the recursive dependency, you need to isolate the children's contents from the outside, thus making speculative layout trivial. This can be done with <code>contain: size</code>, or by manually setting the <code>flex-basis</code> size.</p>

<p>CSS has gained a few constructs like <code>contain</code> or <code>will-transform</code>, which work directly with the layout system, and drop the pretense of <i>one big happy layout</i>. It reveals some of the layer-oriented nature underneath, and is a substitute for e.g. using <code>position: absolute</code> wrappers to do the same.</p>

<p>What these do is strip <i>off</i> some of the semantics, and break the flow of DOM-wide constraints. These are overly broad by default and too document-oriented for the simpler cases. </p>

<p>This is really a metaphor for all DOM APIs.</p>

</div>



<div>
  <p><img src="https://acko.net/files/dom-cruft-2025/css-props-mini.png" alt="CSS props"></p>
  <p><img src="https://acko.net/files/dom-cruft-2025/css-props.png" alt="CSS props"></p>
</div>

<div>

<h2>The Good Parts?</h2>

<p>That said, flex box is pretty decent if you understand these caveats. Building layouts out of nested rows and columns with gaps is intuitive, and adapts well to varying sizes. There is a <i>"CSS: The Good Parts"</i> here, which you can make ergonomic with sufficient love. CSS grids also work similarly, they're just very painfully... CSSy in their syntax.</p>

<p>But if you designed CSS layout from scratch, you wouldn't do it this way. You wouldn't have a subtractive API, with additional extra containment barrier hints. You would instead break the behavior down into its component facets, and use them à la carte. Outside-in and inside-out would both be legible as different kinds of containers and placement models.</p>

<p>The <code>inline-block</code> and <code>inline-flex</code> display models illustrate this: it's a <span><code>block</code></span> or <span><span><code>f</code></span><span><code>l</code></span><span><code>e</code></span><span><code>x</code></span></span> on the inside, but an <code>inline</code> element on the outside. These are two (mostly) orthogonal aspects of a box in a box model.</p>

<p>Text and font styles are in fact the odd ones out, in hypertext. Properties like font size inherit from parent to child, so that formatting tags like <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> can work. But most of those 660 CSS properties do <i>not</i> do that. Setting a border on an element does not apply the same border to all its children recursively, that would be silly.</p>

<p>It shows that CSS is at least two different things mashed together: a system for styling rich text based on inheritance... and a layout system for block and inline elements, nested recursively but without inheritance, only containment. They use the same syntax and APIs, but don't really cascade the same way. Combining this under one style-umbrella was a mistake.</p>

<p>Worth pointing out: early ideas of relative <code>em</code> scaling have largely become irrelevant. We now think of logical vs device pixels instead, which is a far more sane solution, and closer to what users actually expect.</p>

</div>




<div>
  <p><img src="https://acko.net/files/dom-cruft-2025/tiger.svg" alt="Tiger SVG"></p>
</div>

<div>

<p>SVG is natively integrated as well. Having SVGs in the DOM instead of just as <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags is useful to dynamically generate shapes and adjust icon styles.</p>

<p>But while SVG is powerful, it's neither a subset nor superset of CSS. Even when it overlaps, there are subtle differences, like the affine <code>transform</code>. It has its own warts, like serializing all coordinates to strings.</p>

<p>CSS has also gained the ability to round corners, draw gradients, and apply arbitrary clipping masks: it clearly has SVG-envy, but falls very short. SVG can e.g. do polygonal hit-testing for mouse events, which CSS cannot, and SVG has its own set of graphical layer effects.</p>

<p>Whether you use HTML/CSS or SVG to render any particular element is based on specific annoying trade-offs, even if they're all scalable vectors on the back-end.</p>

</div>



<div>

<p>In either case, there are also some roadblocks. I'll just mention three:</p>

<ul>

<li><code>text-ellipsis</code> can only be used to truncate <i>unwrapped</i> text, not entire paragraphs. Detecting truncated text is even harder, as is just measuring text: the APIs are inadequate. Everyone just counts letters instead.</li>

<li><code>position: sticky</code> lets elements stay in place while scrolling with zero jank. While tailor-made for this purpose, it's subtly broken. Having elements remain <i>unconditionally</i> sticky requires an absurd nesting hack, when it should be trivial.</li>

<li>The <code>z-index</code> property determines layering by absolute index. This inevitably leads to a <code>z-index-war.css</code> where everyone is putting in a new number +1 or -1 to make things layer correctly. There is no concept of relative Z positioning.</li>

</ul>

<p>For each of these features, we got stuck with v1 of whatever they could get working, instead of providing the right primitives.</p>

<p>Getting this right isn't easy, it's the hard part of API design. You can only iterate on it, by building real stuff with it before finalizing it, and looking for the holes.</p>


<h2>Oil on Canvas</h2>

<p>So, DOM is bad, CSS is single-digit X% good, and SVG is ugly but necessary... and nobody is in a position to fix it?</p>

<p>Well no. The diagnosis is that the middle layers don't suit anyone particularly well anymore. Just an HTML6 that finally <i>removes</i> things could be a good start.</p>

<p>But most of what needs to happen is to liberate the functionality that is there already. This can be done in good or bad ways. Ideally you design your system so the "escape hatch" for custom use is the <i>same API</i> you built the user-space stuff with. That's what dogfooding is, and also how you get good kernels.</p>

<p>A recent proposal here is <a href="https://github.com/WICG/html-in-canvas/tree/main" target="_blank">HTML in Canvas</a>, to draw HTML content into a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, with full control over the visual output. It's not very good.</p>

<p>While it might seem useful, the only reason the API has the shape that it does is because it's shoehorned into the DOM: elements must be descendants of <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> to fully participate in layout and styling, and to make accessibility work. There are also <i>"technical concerns"</i> with using it off-screen. </p>

<p>One example is this spinny cube:</p>

</div>

<p><img src="https://acko.net/files/dom-cruft-2025/canvas-cube.png" alt="html-in-canvas spinny cube thing">
</p>

<div>

<p>To make it interactive, you attach hit-testing rectangles and respond to paint events. This is a new kind of hit-testing API. But it only works in 2D... so it seems 3D-use is only cosmetic? I have many questions.</p>

<p>Again, if you designed it from scratch, you wouldn't do it this way! In particular, it's absurd that you'd have to take over <i>all</i> interaction responsibilities for an element and its descendants just to be able to customize how it <i>looks</i> i.e. renders. Especially in a browser that has projective CSS 3D transforms.</p>

<p>The use cases not covered by that, e.g. curved re-projection, will also need more complicated hit-testing than rectangles. Did they think this through? What happens when you put a dropdown in there?</p>

<p>To me it seems like they couldn't really figure out how to unify CSS and SVG filters, or how to add shaders to CSS. Passing it thru canvas is the only viable option left. <i>"At least it's programmable."</i> Is it really? Screenshotting DOM content is 1 good use-case, but not what this is sold as at all.</p>

<p>The whole reason to do "complex UIs on canvas" is to do all the things the DOM <i>doesn't do</i>, like virtualizing content, just-in-time layout and styling, visual effects, custom gestures and hit-testing, and so on. It's all nuts and bolts stuff. Having to pre-stage all the DOM content you want to draw sounds... very counterproductive.</p>

<p>From a reactivity point-of-view it's also a bad idea to route this stuff back through the same document tree, because it sets up potential cycles with observers. A canvas that's rendering DOM content isn't really a document element anymore, it's doing something else entirely.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <p><a href="https://farseerdev.github.io/sheet-happens/" target="_blank"><img src="https://acko.net/files/dom-cruft-2025/sheet.png" alt="sheet-happens"></a></p><p><i>Canvas-based spreadsheet that skips the DOM entirely</i></p>
</div>

<div>

<p>The actual achilles heel of canvas is that you don't have any real access to system fonts, text layout APIs, or UI utilities. It's quite absurd how basic it is. You have to <a href="https://farseerdev.github.io/sheet-happens/" target="_blank">implement everything</a> from scratch, including Unicode word splitting, just to get wrapped text.</p>

<p>The proposal is <i>"just use the DOM as a black box for content."</i> But we already know that you can't do anything except more CSS/SVG kitbashing this way. <code>text-ellipsis</code> and friends will still be broken, and you will still need to implement UIs circa 1990 from scratch to fix it.</p>

<p>It's all-or-nothing when you actually want something right in the middle. That's why the lower level needs to be opened up.</p>


<h2>Where To Go From Here</h2>

<p>The goals of <i>"HTML in Canvas"</i> do strike a chord, with chunks of HTML used as free-floating fragments, a notion that has always existed under the hood. It's a composite value type you can handle. But it should not drag 20 years of useless baggage along, while not enabling anything truly novel.</p>

<p>The kitbashing of the web has also resulted in enormous stagnation, and a loss of general UI finesse. When UI behaviors have to be mined out of divs, it limits the kinds of solutions you can even consider. Fixing this within DOM/HTML seems unwise, because there's just too much mess inside. Instead, new surfaces should be opened up outside of it.</p>

</div>



<div>
  <p><a href="https://usegpu.live/demo/layout/display" target="_blank"><img src="https://acko.net/files/dom-cruft-2025/use.gpu-layout.png" alt="use-gpu-layout"></a>
  <a href="https://usegpu.live/demo/layout/align" target="_blank"><img src="https://acko.net/files/dom-cruft-2025/use.gpu-layout-2.png" alt="use-gpu-layout"></a></p><p><i>WebGPU-based box model</i></p>
</div>

<div>

<p>My schtick here has become to point awkwardly at Use.GPU's <a href="https://usegpu.live/demo/layout/display" target="_blank">HTML-like renderer</a>, which does a full X/Y flex model in a fraction of the complexity or code. I don't mean my stuff is super great, no, it's pretty bare-bones and kinda niche... and yet definitely nicer. Vertical centering is easy. Positioning makes sense.</p>

<p>There is no semantic HTML or CSS cascade, just first-class layout. You don't need 61 different accessors for <code>border*</code> either. You can just <a href="https://usegpu.live/demo/rtt/cfd-compute" target="_blank">attach shaders</a> <a href="https://acko.net/files/bluebox/#!/" target="_blank">to divs</a>. Like, that's what people wanted right? Here's <a href="https://usegpu.live/docs/guides-layout-and-ui" target="_blank">a blueprint</a>, it's mostly just <a href="https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions2d/" target="_blank">SDFs</a>.</p>

<p>Font and markup concerns only appear at the leaves of the tree, where the text sits. It's striking how you can do like 90% of what the DOM does here, with a fraction of the complexity of HTML/CSS/SVG, if you just reinvent that wheel. Done by 1 guy. And yes, I know about the second 90% too.</p>

<p>The classic data model here is of a view tree and a render tree. What should the view tree actually look like? And what can it be lowered into? What is it being lowered into right now, by a giant pile of legacy crud?</p>

</div>



<p><a href="https://servo.org/" target="_blank"><img src="https://acko.net/files/dom-cruft-2025/servo.png" alt="servo"></a>
  <a href="https://ladybird.org/" target="_blank"><img src="https://acko.net/files/dom-cruft-2025/ladybird.png" alt="ladybird"></a>
</p>

<div>

<p>Alt-browser projects like Servo or Ladybird are in a position to make good proposals here. They have the freshest implementations, and are targeting the most essential features first. The big browser vendors could also do it, but well, taste matters. Good big systems grow from good small ones, not bad big ones. Maybe if Mozilla hadn't imploded... but alas.</p>

<p>Platform-native UI toolkits are still playing catch up with declarative and reactive UI, so that's that. Native Electron-alternatives like Tauri could be helpful, but they don't treat origin isolation as a design constraint, which makes security teams antsy.</p>

</div>

<div>

<p>There's a feasible carrot to dangle for them though, namely in the form of better process isolation. Because of CPU exploits like Spectre, multi-threading via <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> and Web Workers is kinda dead on arrival anyway, and that affects all WASM. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy" target="_blank">details</a> are <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/45#issuecomment-2077465281" target="_blank">boring</a> but right now it's an impossible sell when websites have to have things like OAuth and Zendesk integrated into them.</p>

<p>Reinventing the DOM to ditch all legacy baggage could coincide with redesigning it for a more multi-threaded, multi-origin, and async web. The browser engines are already multi-process... what did they learn? A lot has happened since Netscape, with advances in structured concurrency, ownership semantics, FP effects... all could come in handy here.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Step 1 should just be a data model that doesn't have 350+ properties per node tho.</p>

<p>Don't be under the mistaken impression that this isn't entirely fixable.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1mhntjh/unpopular_opinion_teacher_ai_use_is_already_out/"><p>I teach HS Science in the south. I can only speak for my district, but a few teacher work days in the wave of enthusiasm I'm seeing for AI tools is overwhelming. We're getting district approved ads for AI tools by email, Admin and ICs are pushing it on us, and at least half of the teaching staff seems all in at this point.</p>
<p>I was just in a meeting with my team and one of the older teachers brought out a powerpoint for our first lesson and almost everyone agreed to use it after a quick scan - but it was missing important tested material, repetitive, and just totally airy and meaningless. Just slide after slide of the same handful of sentences rephrased with random loosely related stock photos. When I asked him if it was AI generated, he said 'of course', like it was a strange question. [...]</p>
<p>We don't have a leg to stand on to teach them anything about originality, academic integrity/intellectual honesty, or the importance of doing things for themselves when they catch us indulging in it just to save time at work.</p></blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-chain-name="c0fUbP76WXURanD" data-gtm-name="Article Body" id="c0fUbP76WXURanD"><article><p>On the heels of fielding the military’s first attack drone team, the U.S. Marine Corps added another weapon to their drone-fighting arsenal: a 90-page handbook all about employing small, unmanned aerial systems against the enemy and integrating them into formations.</p><p>The 1st Marine Division Schools’ Small UAS/Counter-small UAS Integration Handbook was published in June and approved for public release. It’s intended to support the 10-day sUAS/C-sUAS Integration Course recently launched at Camp Pendleton, which expects to see a throughput of about 400 students by the end of the year, according to a report from <a href="https://news.usni.org/2025/06/25/attack-of-the-drones" rel="">USNI News</a>.</p><p>A foreword to the handbook is signed by Lt. Col. Nick Freeman, director of 1st Marine Division Schools, and co-signed by two first lieutenants leading the drone integration and signature management courses. It emphasizes that the handbook will be updated and rewritten often to keep up with evolving capabilities and practices.</p><p>The book “is not a general reference on broader aspects of sUAS-related equipping, organization, and training. Instead, it synthesizes lessons learned and best practices from across 1st Marine Division and elsewhere to provide basic considerations and ‘how to’ instructions that are missing or underdeveloped in other references,” the officers write. </p><p>“In doing so, this guide also develops and seeks to standardize common sUAS procedures for the infantry, fires, reconnaissance, and aviation units that will operate together with this capability.”</p><p>The manual’s publication comes amid a clear shift in defense priorities to favor drone warfare and emphasize, in particular, proficiency with “first-person view” or “one-way attack” small drones designed to pack a lethal punch. </p><p>In addition to the fielding of the <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2025/04/30/marine-training-chief-wants-to-let-ncos-loose-with-more-drone-access/#:~:text=The%20current%20outfit%2C%20Cuomo%20said,26%20hours%20of%20simulator%20training." rel="">Marine Corps’ Attack Drone Team</a>, a small group of troops who will develop ways to employ these kinds of drones and integrate them into formations, the Pentagon in <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2025/07/10/hegseth-calls-for-extensive-reforms-to-pentagon-drone-buying-practices/" rel="">July announced a slate of changes to drone acquisition</a> designed to “establish UAS dominance” by 2027.</p><div><h6>RELATED</h6><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" data-story-url="/news/your-military/2025/04/30/marine-training-chief-wants-to-let-ncos-loose-with-more-drone-access/" data-story-id="72G6QKME7ZAZBFJAWULPLKE5GE" data-feature-id="false" data-story-index="1" data-promo-type="image"><div><figure type="story"><picture><img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/v2/KJR7CJVNEFFBTLG7O53WDXCTRE.jpg?auth=84949f1555a57c62cc1c12d36ae09d827477fd9c4cb0baa9e547e46447a91732&amp;width=8192&amp;height=5462" srcset="https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/v2/KJR7CJVNEFFBTLG7O53WDXCTRE.jpg?auth=84949f1555a57c62cc1c12d36ae09d827477fd9c4cb0baa9e547e46447a91732&amp;width=800&amp;height=533 800w, https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/v2/KJR7CJVNEFFBTLG7O53WDXCTRE.jpg?auth=84949f1555a57c62cc1c12d36ae09d827477fd9c4cb0baa9e547e46447a91732&amp;width=1024&amp;height=682 1024w" width="8192" height="5462"></picture></figure></div></article></div><p>It’s a marked pivot from previous years, in which the services largely emphasized surveillance and logistics as the role of friendly, small drones in warfare and lacked a definitive approach to defending against hostile attack drones. </p><p>In 2020, a <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/07/29/these-marines-just-published-how-guide-hiding-enemy-drones.html" rel="">small group of infantry Marines crowdsourced</a> an unofficial standard operating procedure for camouflaging small units from drone surveillance, underscoring the ad-hoc nature of efforts to account for this threat.</p><p>By contrast, the new 1st Marine Division handbook standardizes employment of various drones down to a common vocabulary. </p><p>Drone holding areas “are named after women and [battle positions] are named after animals (beginning with snakes), [loitering areas] are given the names of cigarettes and [task positions] are named after insects,” the manual states.</p><p>In addition, “hot walls” and “pizza slices” describe drone operating areas for hasty airspace deconfliction. </p><p>Charts and schematics show sample drone strikes in various personnel and equipment configurations. Tables break down specifications of the Corps’ most widely fielded small UAS. A sample strike brief provides a precise template for communications around drone operations. And a multi-page section on camouflage and evasion provides formal guidance on everything from hiding heat signatures to using vegetation to blend visually with the environment.</p><p>Drone employment as a team effort is emphasized throughout the book.</p><p>“In all cases, the operator of any one aerial system is unlikely to accomplish the unit’s mission by him/herself; instead, the operator performs tasks as part of a sUAS-equipped team whose other members may variously perform roles related to communications, targeting, mobility, protection, fires, maneuver/exploitation, and others,” the guide reads. </p><p>“For this reason, this handbook refers to sUAS teams as the basic unit of employment for these systems, even when the unit operating them (for example, a rifle squad or an artillery battery headquarters) may not have sUAS employment as its primary purpose.”</p><p>The handbook concludes with a list of chapters and sections the book is still missing, including weaponeering considerations for employing drones carrying munitions and a full chapter on tactics, techniques and procedures for one-way attack drones.</p><p>“Make no mistake, we are in a very tight race with our adversaries to master the possibilities of small aerial drones,” the authors write. “Consider this handbook a baton—now take it, and run with it!”</p><figure><figure><picture><img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/resizer/v2/J5ON7Y2ROFB7DMYM5UTINDJOSU.jpg?auth=cd9b602d7f718768f26b0d82fe0c9ff854115b8ca8ea13e4ae4e81d259b03703&amp;width=7210&amp;height=4809" srcset="https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/resizer/v2/J5ON7Y2ROFB7DMYM5UTINDJOSU.jpg?auth=cd9b602d7f718768f26b0d82fe0c9ff854115b8ca8ea13e4ae4e81d259b03703&amp;width=800&amp;height=533 800w, https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/resizer/v2/J5ON7Y2ROFB7DMYM5UTINDJOSU.jpg?auth=cd9b602d7f718768f26b0d82fe0c9ff854115b8ca8ea13e4ae4e81d259b03703&amp;width=1024&amp;height=682 1024w" width="7210" height="4809"></picture></figure><figcaption>Marines with Advanced Infantry Training Battalion, School of Infantry – East load a Mjolnir munitions system on a SkyRaider. (Cpl. Zachariah Ferraro/Marine Corps)</figcaption></figure><p>While 1st Marine Division did not make anyone available to talk about the handbook by press time, Samuel Bendett, an adviser focusing on Russian military technology and capabilities including drones, called the book’s publication evidence of a “psychological shift” about the realities of the drone threat and the need to employ small UAS skillfully.</p><p>The handbook itself acknowledges lessons in drone use absorbed from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, where both sides have employed UAS to great effect. </p><p>While Bendett acknowledged that the next U.S. fight might not resemble the conflict in Ukraine, he maintained that the echoes of that war “will be heard in every conflict going forward,” adding that China was paying close attention and already training its military in drone warfare.</p><p>“It’s not just an abstract notion that there are adversary drones somewhere and we have to defend against them,” Bendett said. “It’s the fact that it’s right there, just around the bend, just just beyond the next building, just beyond the next tree. It’s there just two or three klicks away, and it’s observing and flying at you, and you won’t be able to react in time if you’re not prepared for it.”</p><p>Another helpful shift evidenced in the document, he said, was in viewing UAS not as small aircraft, but as weapons.</p><p>“These are not aircraft,” he said. “These are cheaper, attritable tactical systems that should be available to every military formation, based on what they’re doing and based on how they’re fighting.”</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="pagebody" role="main" class="page">
<p><strong>Software rot</strong> is generally thought of as degradation of <a href="https://permacomputing.net/software/">software</a> due to a changing environment. For example, a program written a decade ago may no longer work with new versions of the libraries it depends on because some of them have changed without retaining backwards compatibility. This kind of thinking encourages a culture where software becomes <a href="https://permacomputing.net/obsolescence/">obsolete</a> unless it is constantly maintained.</p>

<p>A better approach might be to talk about the reliability of the environment the software depends on. Would you build a house on a bog?</p>

<p>It is often necessary to build on "bogs" (i.e. "actively developed" platforms), but it might be a good idea to also be compatible with a <a href="https://permacomputing.net/bedrock_platform/">bedrock platform</a> whose specifications are static and solid.</p>

<p>Software rot is a big issue for cultures that constantly produce new programs (such as <a href="https://permacomputing.net/games/">games</a> or <a href="https://permacomputing.net/demoscene/">demos</a>) that are not supposed to be constantly maintained after release. Programs written for classical platforms (such as <a href="https://permacomputing.net/DOS/">DOS</a> or <span><a href="https://permacomputing.net/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;from=software_rot&amp;page=NES" rel="nofollow">?</a>NES</span>) usually need no post-release maintentance at all, while those written for e.g. <span><a href="https://permacomputing.net/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;from=software_rot&amp;page=Linux" rel="nofollow">?</a>Linux</span> will likely cease working in a decade or two. Sometimes, serious <span><a href="https://permacomputing.net/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;from=software_rot&amp;page=media_archeology" rel="nofollow">?</a>media archeology</span> work (such as finding specific versions of old libraries) is needed to get a program to run again.</p>

    <section id="post-body"><p>Alright, let's have a real talk. For years, the AI world has been obsessed with BIG. Big models, big data, big GPUs, and even bigger cloud bills. Most text-to-speech (TTS) models today are heavyweight champs of burning cash. We're talking about multi-billion parameter, GPU-guzzling monsters that need more silicon than your phone, your laptop, and maybe your entire neighborhood combined. They give you great voices, sure... but only if you're willing to sign away your firstborn to AWS.</p><p>Forget that. The era of bloated AI is OVER.</p><p>What if I told you the real revolution isn't coming from a massive, air-conditioned data center? It's coming from a model so small, it's almost a joke. A model that fits on a thumb drive with room to spare.</p><h2 id="say-hello-to-kitten-tts-%F0%9F%98%BB">Say hello to <strong>Kitten TTS</strong>. 😻</h2><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Introducing Kitten TTS, a SOTA tiny text-to-speech model</p><p>- Just 15M parameters <br>- Runs without a GPU<br>- Model size less than 25 MB<br>- Multiple high-quality voices<br>- Ultra-fast - even runs on low-end edge devices</p><p>Github and HF links below <a href="https://t.co/9T3u1M0WGo">pic.twitter.com/9T3u1M0WGo</a></p></div>— Divam Gupta (@divamgupta) <a href="https://twitter.com/divamgupta/status/1952762876504187065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>This isn't just another model dropped on Hugging Face; it's a statement. It's the David to the Goliath of big tech AI. Developed by the wizards at KittenML, this thing is here to prove that size ISN'T everything.</p><p>And listen, this isn't happening in a vacuum. The whole industry is waking up and smelling the coffee smaller, smarter, more efficient models are the future. We are witnessing a massive shift towards lean, on-device AI that actually respects your privacy and your wallet. This is about putting power back into the hands of the builders, the creators, the hobbyists the people who don't have a venture capitalist on speed dial. This move away from centralized, big-tech-controlled AI toward a distributed, community-driven ecosystem is the most exciting thing happening in tech right now. And Kitten TTS isn't just following the trend; it's leading the charge.</p><h2 id="the-specs-that-will-blow-your-mind-%F0%9F%A4%AF"><strong>The Specs That Will BLOW YOUR MIND 🤯</strong></h2><p>Okay, let's get into the nitty-gritty. What makes this little beast tick? These aren't just bullet points on a GitHub README; these are the specs that will fundamentally redefine what you thought was possible with local AI.</p><h3 id="15m-parameters-25mb-size-no-thats-not-a-typo"><strong>15M Parameters &amp; &lt;25MB Size. NO, THAT'S NOT A TYPO.</strong></h3><p>Most so-called "lightweight" models are still chunky boys, coming in at hundreds of megabytes. Kitten TTS? It clocks in at <strong>under 25MB</strong> with just <strong>15 million parameters</strong>. Let that sink in. That's smaller than most of the photos you take on your phone. It's about one-fifth the size of the previous "small" champion, Kokoro-82M, a model that was already celebrated for its efficiency. This ridiculously small footprint means it downloads in seconds and can be deployed on literally anything.</p><h3 id="runs-without-a-gpu-your-wallet-can-thank-us"><strong>Runs WITHOUT A GPU. Your Wallet Can Thank Us.</strong></h3><p>This is the big one. This is for all my "GPU-poor" folks out there who have been watching the AI revolution from the sidelines.<strong><sup> </sup></strong>YOU DO NOT NEED AN EXPENSIVE GRAPHICS CARD. Kitten TTS is aggressively CPU-optimized to run on your everyday laptop, a cheap Raspberry Pi, your Android phone... and probably even a smart toaster if you're feeling adventurous. I'm not kidding people have tested this on a free Google Colab CPU instance, and it was generating audio in SECONDS. The barrier to entry just got obliterated.</p><h3 id="multiple-expressive-voices-the-whole-fam"><strong>Multiple Expressive Voices (The Whole Fam!)</strong></h3><p>For a model this tiny, you'd expect a single, robotic, "Stephen Hawking circa 1988" voice, right? WRONG. Kitten TTS ships with <strong>eight different expressive voices</strong> four female and four male right out of the box. For a model of this size, the level of expressivity is honestly shocking and a massive advantage for anyone looking to build applications with character. We'll meet them all in a bit.</p><h3 id="ultra-fast-inference-for-real-time-apps"><strong>Ultra-Fast Inference for Real-Time Apps</strong></h3><p>This thing is BUILT FOR SPEED. It’s optimized for real-time speech synthesis, which means no more awkward, laggy delays in your applications. This is absolutely critical for building responsive chatbots, voice assistants that don't make you wait, and on-the-fly narration for accessibility tools. Anecdotal reports from community demos show it generating audio faster than real-time even on consumer hardware.</p><h3 id="open-source-baby-apache-20-license"><strong>OPEN SOURCE, BABY! (Apache 2.0 License)</strong></h3><p>And here's the cherry on top. The best part. It's completely open source under the permissive Apache 2.0 license. This means you can use it for free. For your personal projects. For your commercial products. For whatever you want. No strings attached. Go build something amazing and make some money! The code is on GitHub, the model is on Hugging Face... the playground is yours.</p><p>What's truly remarkable here is the cascade of innovation. It all starts with the core architectural breakthrough: achieving impressive quality with a tiny number of parameters. This single achievement directly causes the sub-25MB model size. That small size, in turn, is what allows it to run so efficiently on CPU-only systems. And that CPU efficiency is what unlocks its potential on low-power edge devices like the Raspberry Pi. It's a beautiful domino effect where one smart design choice solves for size, cost, and speed all at once the holy trinity for edge AI.</p><h2 id="enough-talk-lets-get-this-running-now-the-5-minute-guide"><strong>Enough Talk! Let's Get This Running NOW (The 5-Minute Guide)</strong></h2><p>Theory is great, but code is king. Let's get this running on your machine. No more excuses, this is copy-paste-ready. Let's GO! 🚀</p><h3 id="step-1-the-magical-one-line-install"><strong>Step 1: The Magical One-Line Install</strong></h3><p>Open your terminal. Do the right thing and create a virtual environment (<code>python -m venv.venv &amp;&amp; source.venv/bin/activate</code>). Now, paste this in. That's it. You're done.</p><pre><code># It's this easy, seriously.
pip install https://github.com/KittenML/KittenTTS/releases/download/0.1/kittentts-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl</code></pre><h3 id="step-2-your-first-hello-world-basic-generation"><strong>Step 2: Your First "Hello World" (Basic Generation)</strong></h3><p>Create a Python file, call it <code>test_kitten.py</code>, and drop this code in. This will automatically grab the model from Hugging Face the first time you run it and generate your very first audio file.</p><pre><code># test_kitten.py

print(f"✅ Audio saved to {output_file}! Go listen to it!")</code></pre><p>Run it with <code>python test_kitten.py</code> and go check out <code>hello_kitten.wav</code>. Welcome to the future.</p><h3 id="step-3-meet-the-whole-crew-looping-through-all-voices"><strong>Step 3: Meet the Whole Crew (Looping Through All Voices)</strong></h3><p>Okay, that was cool, but you just used the default voice. <strong>PRO TIP:</strong> The default voice (<code>expr-voice-5-m</code>) is... let's just say it has <em>character</em>. Some of the other voices are WAY better for general use. Let's generate a sample for every single voice so you can pick your favorite for your next project.</p><p>Create a new file, <code>all_voices.py</code>:</p><pre><code># all_voices.py
from kittentts import KittenTTS
import soundfile as sf

m = KittenTTS("KittenML/kitten-tts-nano-0.1")

TEXT = "Kitten TTS is an open-source series of tiny and expressive Text-to-Speech models for on-device applications."

    print(f"▶️ Generating for voice '{voice}' -&gt; {output_file}")
    
    # The magic is here: specify the voice!
    m.generate_to_file(TEXT, output_file, voice=voice)
    
print("✅ All voice samples generated!")</code></pre><p>Run this script, and you'll get a <code>.wav</code> file for each voice. To make it even easier, here's the official roster.</p>

<h2 id="under-the-hood-how-does-this-magic-work-a-technical-deep-dive"><strong>Under the Hood: How Does This Magic Work? (A Technical Deep Dive)</strong></h2><p>So, how in the world did KittenML pull this off? How do you squeeze a decent-quality voice out of a model that's smaller than a cat video? While the team hasn't released a full research paper just yet, the open-source community has put on its detective hat, and the consensus is pretty clear.</p><p>The smart money, especially among the folks at r/LocalLLaMA, is that Kitten TTS is built on an architecture that's very similar to <strong>VITS</strong> (Variational Inference with Adversarial Learning for End-to-End Text-to-Speech) or possibly <strong>StyleTTS2</strong>.</p><p>Don't let the alphabet soup of an acronym scare you. VITS is a brilliantly clever end-to-end system that mashes up several powerful AI concepts into one elegant package:</p><ol><li><strong>Variational Autoencoder (VAE):</strong> At its core, a VAE is great at learning a compressed, meaningful representation of data. In this case, it learns the essential "essence" of speech.</li><li><strong>Normalizing Flows:</strong> This is a fancy mathematical trick that helps the model produce more diverse and natural-sounding variations in the speech, avoiding a monotonous, robotic tone.</li><li><strong>Generative Adversarial Network (GAN):</strong> This is the secret sauce that pushes the quality over the top. A GAN consists of two models locked in a battle to the death.<ul><li>The <strong>Generator</strong> creates the audio from text.</li><li>The <strong>Discriminator</strong> acts like a critic, trying to tell if the audio it hears is from a real human or a fake from the Generator.</li><li>They are trained together. The Generator's only goal is to fool the Discriminator, and the Discriminator's only goal is to not be fooled. Through this adversarial process, the Generator gets incredibly good at producing highly realistic speech.</li></ul></li></ol><p>This architecture is perfect for a model named "Kitten" because it's known for being incredibly efficient. It's a non-autoregressive model, which means it generates audio chunks in parallel instead of one sample at a time. This makes it blazing fast compared to older, step-by-step models like Tacotron 2. This combination of a VAE, GAN, and a parallel transformer backbone is what allows models like VITS and likely Kitten to be small, fast, and high-quality all at once.</p><p>The success here isn't necessarily about inventing a single, brand-new algorithm from thin air. It's about masterful engineering. It's the art of taking several powerful, proven concepts and synthesizing them into a highly optimized and refined implementation. This is a testament to the fact that in modern AI, execution and clever combination are just as important as pure research.</p><h2 id="kitten-tts-vs-the-world-a-local-tts-showdown"><strong>Kitten TTS vs. The World: A Local TTS Showdown</strong></h2><p>Okay, Kitten TTS is cool on its own. But how does it stack up against the other legends of local TTS? Let's throw it in the ring and see what happens. Ding ding! 🥊</p><h3 id="kitten-tts-vs-piper-tts"><strong>Kitten TTS vs. Piper TTS</strong></h3><p>This is the ultimate battle for the soul of your Raspberry Pi. For a long time, Piper TTS has been the undisputed king of fast, offline, on-device speech synthesis. It's known for being incredibly fast, running on minimal hardware, and having solid voice quality.</p><p><strong>The Verdict:</strong> Kitten is the new challenger, and it's coming in with a significant weight advantage. It is even <em>smaller</em> than most of Piper's voice models and targets the same CPU-only performance profile. For pure, bare-metal efficiency and the absolute smallest possible footprint, Kitten has a real edge. However, Piper has a more mature ecosystem, a wider variety of community-trained voices, and better language support at the moment. It's a close fight.</p><p>Your Choice: If you need the absolute tiniest model for an English-language project, try Kitten first. If you need broader language support or want to tap into a larger library of voices, Piper is still a fantastic choice.</p><h3 id="kitten-tts-vs-kokoro-tts"><strong>Kitten TTS vs. Kokoro TTS</strong></h3><p>Kokoro was the model that first made the community truly believe that small, high-quality TTS was possible. At 82M parameters, it was a huge step down from the billion-parameter giants and delivered impressive "Siri-like" quality on standard CPUs.</p><p><strong>The Verdict:</strong> This is a generational leap. Kitten TTS is <strong>~15M parameters</strong>. Kokoro walked so that Kitten could run a marathon. While Kokoro proved the concept, Kitten has refined it to an extreme degree, offering comparable or better expressiveness at a fraction of the size.</p><p>Your Choice: For any new project where efficiency is a concern, Kitten TTS is the clear winner in the size-to-quality trade-off.</p><h3 id="kitten-tts-vs-coqui-xtts"><strong>Kitten TTS vs. Coqui XTTS</strong></h3><p>This isn't a direct fight; it's about picking the right tool for the job. Coqui's XTTS is a heavyweight champion in its own right, but for a different reason: its incredible <strong>zero-shot voice cloning</strong>. You can feed it a mere 6-second audio clip of a voice, and it can start speaking in that voice. It's magic, but it's a different kind of magic.</p><p><strong>The Verdict:</strong> If your project requires cloning a specific voice, XTTS is the model you want. No question. But this power comes at a cost it's a much larger model and really wants a GPU to run smoothly. Kitten TTS is built for a different purpose: providing a set of high-quality, pre-built voices in the most lightweight and efficient package possible.</p><p>Your Choice: Use Kitten for speed, efficiency, and on-device deployment. Use XTTS for voice cloning and advanced style transfer features.</p><p>To make it even clearer, here's a handy comparison table:</p>

<h2 id="the-game-changing-applications-this-is-why-were-all-here"><strong>The Game-Changing Applications (This Is Why We're All Here)</strong></h2><p>Specs and code are fun, but what can you <em>actually build</em> with this? This is where it gets really exciting. Kitten TTS isn't just a cool tech demo; it's an enabler for a whole new generation of applications that were previously impossible, impractical, or just too damn expensive.</p><h3 id="application-1-true-edge-ai-private-iot"><strong>Application 1: True Edge AI &amp; Private IoT</strong></h3><p>Because Kitten runs entirely locally, it is the perfect engine for <strong>Edge AI</strong>. Think about it: smart home devices that can talk to you without sending your conversations to a server in another country.<strong><sup> </sup></strong>This means three huge things:</p><ol><li><strong>Lower Latency:</strong> Responses are instant because there's no round-trip to the cloud.</li><li><strong>Better Privacy:</strong> Your data never leaves your device. This is a massive deal.</li><li><strong>Offline Functionality:</strong> It works even when your internet is down.</li></ol><p>This unlocks applications like voice-enabled industrial sensors, talking toys for kids that don't spy on them, and smart home assistants that actually respect your privacy.<strong><sup> </sup></strong>The move to on-device processing is a direct response to growing public concern over data privacy, and Kitten is perfectly positioned to power this new wave of secure-by-design products. By eliminating the need to transmit sensitive voice data, it not only protects users but also simplifies compliance with data sovereignty laws.</p><h3 id="application-2-revolutionizing-accessibility-tools"><strong>Application 2: Revolutionizing Accessibility Tools</strong></h3><p>This one is HUGE, and it's something the community is genuinely excited about. People with visual impairments or learning disabilities like dyslexia rely on screen readers to access the digital world. But let's be honest, many of the default voices are still robotic and fatiguing to listen to. A user on Reddit specifically brought up this pain point, wishing for a better voice for the <strong>NVDA screen reader</strong> that wouldn't hog system resources.</p><p>Kitten TTS is the answer. It is small and fast enough to be integrated directly into accessibility tools like NVDA, providing a much more natural, human-sounding voice without slowing down the user's computer. This isn't just a cool feature; it's technology that can genuinely improve people's daily lives and make the digital world more inclusive.</p><h3 id="application-3-the-indie-dev-hobbyists-dream"><strong>Application 3: The Indie Dev &amp; Hobbyist's Dream</strong></h3><p>Want to build a voice for your custom robot? Need to give dialogue to characters in your indie game? Want to create a custom Jarvis-like assistant for your workshop? Before Kitten, you'd need to wrestle with a pricey API or set up a dedicated server. Now, you can do it all on a <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>. Kitten TTS democratizes high-quality voice synthesis, putting it directly into the hands of every creator, student, and hobbyist, regardless of their budget.</p><h2 id="the-final-verdict-the-future-of-kitten"><strong>The Final Verdict &amp; The Future of Kitten</strong></h2><p>So, is Kitten TTS the perfect, flawless model that will end all others? Let's be real: <strong>not yet</strong>. It's still in <strong>developer preview</strong>. Some users have noted a bit of "soft distortion" in the audio or that the quality isn't quite at the level of the massive, expensive cloud APIs. There's a reason it's called a "preview," after all.</p><p>BUT, that's completely missing the point. The magic of Kitten TTS isn't that it's better than a model 1000x its size. The magic is that it's <strong>so damn good <em>for</em> its size</strong>. The performance-to-parameter ratio is absolutely off the charts. It represents a quantum leap in efficiency and accessibility.</p><p>And the story isn't over. The KittenML team has already announced they're working on a larger, <strong>~80M parameter model</strong> that will use the same eight expressive voices. This "big brother" version will likely smooth out the minor quality issues of the 'nano' model while still being small and efficient enough to run on a CPU. The future is incredibly bright.</p><p>Kitten TTS is a game-changer. It's a testament to the power of open-source innovation and the unstoppable trend toward smarter, smaller, more accessible AI.</p><p>Don't just read about it. <strong>Go build something!</strong></p><ul><li><strong>GitHub Repo: </strong><a href="https://github.com/KittenML/KittenTTS" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/KittenML/KittenTTS</a></li><li><strong>Hugging Face Model:</strong> <a href="https://huggingface.co/KittenML/kitten-tts-nano-0.1" rel="noopener">https://huggingface.co/KittenML/kitten-tts-nano-0.1</a></li><li><strong>Live Web Demo (Community Built!):</strong> <a href="https://clowerweb.github.io/kitten-tts-web-demo/" rel="noopener">https://clowerweb.github.io/kitten-tts-web-demo/</a></li><li><strong>Join the Discord:</strong> <a href="https://discord.gg/upcyF5s6" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/upcyF5s6</a></li></ul><h2 id="faq-disambiguation"><strong>FAQ &amp; Disambiguation</strong></h2><h3 id="wait-isnt-kitten-a-character-from-warhammer-40k"><strong>Wait, Isn't Kitten a Character from Warhammer 40k?</strong></h3><p>LOL, you got us.

The community is eagerly waiting!</p><h3 id="what-about-benchmarks-like-rtf-or-mos"><strong>What about benchmarks like RTF or MOS?</strong></h3><p>No official, formal benchmarks have been published by the creators yet. However, we can get a clue from the community. In a web demo, one user on an M1 Mac clocked a generation time of about 19 seconds for a 26-second audio clip. This gives us a rough</p><p><strong>Real-Time Factor (RTF)</strong> of about 0.73. RTF is simply the time it takes to generate the audio divided by the duration of the audio itself, so anything under 1.0 is faster than real-time.

Use Kitten for preset voices and speed; XTTS for cloning.</p><h3 id="kitten-tts-vs-piper-what-should-i-pick"><strong>Kitten TTS vs Piper what should I pick?</strong></h3><p>If you want the <strong>smallest</strong> footprint for English on CPU, start with Kitten. If you need broader language coverage and a mature ecosystem, Piper is still excellent. I use both depending on target.</p><h3 id="kitten-tts-vs-kokoro-who-wins-on-cpus"><strong>Kitten TTS vs Kokoro who wins on CPUs?</strong></h3><p>Kokoro (≈82M) proved small can sound good; Kitten pushes size/latency further at ~15M. For super-lean builds, Kitten has the edge; Kokoro has more established usage and voices.</p><h3 id="is-the-license-ok-for-commercial-use"><strong>Is the license OK for commercial use?</strong></h3><p>Yes. <strong>Apache-2.0</strong> permissive and business-friendly. Ship it.</p><h3 id="how-do-i-install-it-quickly"><strong>How do I install it quickly?</strong></h3><p>Create a venv and <code>pip install</code> the wheel from the latest GitHub release, then load <code>"KittenML/kitten-tts-nano-0.1"</code> in your code. Simple, reproducible, and offline-friendly.</p><h3 id="is-it-fast-enough-for-real-time"><strong>Is it fast enough for real-time?</strong></h3><p>Early community reports and the browser demo are promising on CPU. For snappy UX, stream shorter chunks and cache frequent phrases.</p><h3 id="any-gotchas-i-should-know"><strong>Any gotchas I should know?</strong></h3><p>It’s a <strong>developer preview</strong> some users note mild artifacts on certain voices. I pick the cleaner presets (e.g., “2-f/2-m/4-f”) for narration.</p><h3 id="what-are-good-use-cases-right-now"><strong>What are good use cases right now?</strong></h3><p>On-device assistants, offline accessibility tools, indie games/NPCs, and privacy-sensitive apps that can’t rely on cloud TTS. (That’s exactly where I’d ship it first.)</p></section>
