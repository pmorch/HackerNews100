<p dir="auto"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Welcome to the FFmpeg School of Assembly Language. You have taken the first step on the most interesting, challenging, and rewarding journey in programming. These lessons will give you a grounding in the way assembly language is written in FFmpeg and open your eyes to what's actually going on in your computer..</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Required Knowledge</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Knowledge of C, in particular pointers. If you don't know C, work through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language" rel="nofollow">The C Programming Language</a> book</li>
<li>High School Mathematics (scalar vs vector, addition, multiplication etc)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>What is assembly language?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Assembly language is a programming language where you write code that directly corresponds to the instructions a CPU processes. Human readable assembly language is, as the name suggests, <em>assembled</em> into binary data, known as <em>machine code</em>, that the CPU can understand. You might see assembly language code referred to as “assembly” or “asm” for short.</p>
<p dir="auto">The vast majority of assembly code in FFmpeg is what's known as <em>SIMD, Single Instruction Multiple Data</em>. SIMD is sometimes referred to as vector programming. This means that a particular instruction operates on multiple elements of data at the same time. Most programming languages operate on one data element at a time, known as scalar programming.</p>
<p dir="auto">As you might have guessed, SIMD lends itself well to processing images, video, and audio which have lots of data ordered sequentially in memory. There are specialist instructions available in the CPU to help us process sequential data.</p>
<p dir="auto">In FFmpeg, you'll see the terms “assembly function”, “SIMD”, and “vector(ise)” used interchangeably. They all refer to the same thing: Writing a function in assembly language by hand to process multiple elements of data in one go. Some projects may also refer to these as “assembly kernels”.</p>
<p dir="auto">All of this might sound complicated, but it's important to remember that in FFmpeg, high schoolers have written assembly code. As with everything, learning is 50% jargon and 50% actual learning.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why do we write in assembly language?</strong><br>
To make multimedia processing fast. It’s very common to get a 10x or more speed improvement from writing assembly code, which is especially important when wanting to play videos in real time without stuttering. It also saves energy and extends battery life. It’s worth pointing out that video encode and decode functions are some of the most heavily used functions on earth, both by end-users and by big companies in their datacentres. So even a small improvement adds up quickly.</p>
<p dir="auto">You’ll often see, online, people use <em>intrinsics,</em> which are C-like functions that map to assembly instructions to allow for faster development. In FFmpeg we don’t use intrinsics but instead write assembly code by hand. This is an area of controversy, but intrinsics are typically around 10-15% slower than hand-written assembly (intrinsics supporters would disagree), depending on the compiler. For FFmpeg, every bit of extra performance helps, which is why we write in assembly code directly. There’s also an argument that intrinsics are difficult to read owing to their use of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation" rel="nofollow">Hungarian Notation</a>”.</p>
<p dir="auto">You may also see <em>inline assembly</em> (i.e. not using intrinsics) remaining in a few places in FFmpeg for historical reasons, or in projects like the Linux Kernel because of very specific use cases there. This is where assembly code is not in a separate file, but written inline with C code. The prevailing opinion in projects like FFmpeg is that this code is hard to read, not widely supported by compilers and unmaintainable.</p>
<p dir="auto">Lastly, you’ll see a lot of self-proclaimed experts online saying none of this is necessary and the compiler can do all of this “vectorisation” for you. At least for the purpose of learning, ignore them: recent tests in e.g. <a href="https://www.videolan.org/projects/dav1d.html" rel="nofollow">the dav1d project</a> showed around a 2x speedup from this automatic vectorisation, while the hand-written versions could reach 8x.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Flavours of assembly language</strong><br>
These lessons will focus on x86 64-bit assembly language. This is also known as amd64, although it still works on Intel CPUs. There are other types of assembly for other CPUs like ARM and RISC-V and potentially in the future these lessons will be extended to cover those.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are two flavours of x86 assembly syntax that you’ll see online: AT&amp;T and Intel. AT&amp;T Syntax is older and harder to read compared to Intel syntax. So we will use Intel syntax.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Supporting materials</strong><br>
You might be surprised to hear that books or online resources like Stack Overflow are not particularly helpful as references. This is in part because of our choice to use handwritten assembly with Intel syntax. But also because a lot of online resources are focused on operating system programming or hardware programming, usually using non-SIMD code. FFmpeg assembly is particularly focused on high performance image processing, and as you’ll see it’s a particularly unique approach to assembly programming. That said, it’s easy to understand other assembly use-cases once you’ve completed these lessons</p>
<p dir="auto">Many books go into a lot of computer architecture details before teaching assembly. This is fine if that’s what you want to learn, but from our standpoint, it’s like studying engines before learning to drive a car.</p>
<p dir="auto">That said, the diagrams in the later parts of “The Art of 64-bit assembly” book showing SIMD instructions and their behaviour in a visual form are helpful: <a href="https://artofasm.randallhyde.com/" rel="nofollow">https://artofasm.randallhyde.com/</a></p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Registers</strong><br>
Registers are areas in the CPU where data can be processed. CPUs don’t operate on memory directly, but instead data is loaded into registers, processed, and written back to memory. In assembly language, generally, you cannot directly copy data from one memory location to another without first passing that data through a register.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>General Purpose Registers</strong><br>
The first type of register is what is known as a General Purpose Register (GPR). GPRs are referred to as general purpose because they can contain either data, in this case up to a 64-bit value, or a memory address (a pointer). A value in a GPR can be processed through operations like addition, multiplication, shifting, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">In most assembly books, there are whole chapters dedicated to the subtleties of GPRs, the historical background etc. This is because GPRs are important when it comes to operating system programming, reverse engineering, etc. In the assembly code written in FFmpeg, GPRs are more like scaffolding and most of the time their complexities are not needed and abstracted away.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Vector registers</strong><br>
Vector (SIMD) registers, as the name suggests, contain multiple data elements. There are various types of vector registers:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>mm registers - MMX registers, 64-bit sized, historic and not used much any more</li>
<li>xmm registers - XMM registers, 128-bit sized, widely available</li>
<li>ymm registers - YMM registers, 256-bit sized, some complications when using these</li>
<li>zmm registers - ZMM registers, 512-bit sized, limited availability</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Most calculations in video compression and decompression are integer-based so we’ll stick to that. Here’s an example of 16 bytes in an xmm register:</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
<th>c</th>
<th>d</th>
<th>e</th>
<th>f</th>
<th>g</th>
<th>h</th>
<th>i</th>
<th>j</th>
<th>k</th>
<th>l</th>
<th>m</th>
<th>n</th>
<th>o</th>
<th>p</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">But it could be eight words (16-bit integers)</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
<th>c</th>
<th>d</th>
<th>e</th>
<th>f</th>
<th>g</th>
<th>h</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">Or four double words (32-bit integers)</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
<th>c</th>
<th>d</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">Or two quadwords (64-bit integers):</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">To recap:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>b</strong>ytes - 8-bit data</li>
<li><strong>w</strong>ords - 16-bit data</li>
<li><strong>d</strong>oublewords - 32-bit data</li>
<li><strong>q</strong>uadwords - 64-bit data</li>
<li><strong>d</strong>ouble <strong>q</strong>uadwords - 128-bit data</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The bold characters will be important later.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>x86inc.asm include</strong><br>
You’ll see in many examples we include the file x86inc.asm. X86inc.asm is a lightweight abstraction layer used in FFmpeg, x264, and dav1d to make an assembly programmer's life easier. It helps in many ways, but to begin with, one of the useful things it does is it labels GPRs, r0, r1, r2. This means you don’t have to remember any register names. As mentioned before, GPRs are generally just scaffolding so this makes life a lot easier.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A simple scalar asm snippet</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Let’s look at a simple (and very much artificial) snippet of scalar asm (assembly code that operates on individual data items, one at a time, within each instruction) to see what’s going on:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="mov  r0q, 3  
inc  r0q  
dec  r0q  
imul r0q, 5"><pre><span>mov</span><span>  r0q</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>  </span>
<span>inc</span><span>  r0q  </span>
<span>dec</span><span>  r0q  </span>
<span>imul</span><span> r0q</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>5</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In the first line, the <em>immediate value</em> 3 (a value stored directly in the assembly code itself as opposed to a value fetched from memory) is being stored into register r0 as a quadword. Note that in Intel syntax, the source operand (the value or location providing the data, located on the right) is transferred to the destination operand (the location receiving the data, located on the left), much like the behavior of memcpy. You can also read it as “r0q = 3”, since the order is the same. The “q” suffix of r0 designates the register as being used as a quadword. inc increments the value so that r0q contains 4, dec decrements the value back to 3. imul multiplies the value by 5. So at the end, r0q contains 15.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that the human readable instructions such as mov and inc, which are assembled into machine code by the assembler, are known as <em>mnemonics</em>. You may see online and in books mnemonics represented with capital letters like MOV and INC but these are the same as the lower case versions. In FFmpeg, we use lower case mnemonics and keep upper case reserved for macros.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Understanding a basic vector function</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Here’s our first SIMD function:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="%include &quot;x86inc.asm&quot;

SECTION .text

;static void add_values(const uint8_t *src, const uint8_t *src2)  
INIT_XMM sse2  
cglobal add_values, 2, 2, 2, src, src2   
    movu  m0, [srcq]  
    movu  m1, [src2q]

    paddb m0, m1

    movu  [srcq], m0

    RET"><pre><span>%include</span> <span>"x86inc.asm"</span>

<span>SECTION</span><span> .text</span>

<span>;static void add_values(const uint8_t *src, const uint8_t *src2)  </span>
<span>INIT_XMM sse2  </span>
<span>c</span><span>global</span> <span>add_values</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> src</span><span>,</span><span> src2   </span>
<span>    movu  m0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>srcq</span><span>]</span><span>  </span>
<span>    movu  m1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>src2q</span><span>]</span>

<span>    </span><span>paddb</span><span> m0</span><span>,</span><span> m1</span>

<span>    movu  </span><span>[</span><span>srcq</span><span>],</span><span> m0</span>

<span>    </span><span>RET</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Let’s go through it line by line:</p>

<p dir="auto">This is a “header” developed in the x264, FFmpeg, and dav1d communities to provide helpers, predefined names and macros (such as cglobal below) to simplify writing assembly.</p>

<p dir="auto">This denotes the section where the code you want to execute is placed. This is in contrast to the .data section, where you can put constant data.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=";static void add_values(const uint8_t *src, const uint8_t *src2);  
INIT_XMM sse2"><pre><span>;static void add_values(const uint8_t *src, const uint8_t *src2);  </span>
<span>INIT_XMM sse2</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The first line is a comment (the semi-colon “;” in asm is like “//” in C) showing what the function argument looks like in C. The second line shows how we are initialising the function to use XMM registers, using the sse2 instruction set. This is because paddb is an sse2 instruction. We’ll cover sse2 in more detail in the next lesson.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cglobal add_values, 2, 2, 2, src, src2"><pre><span>c</span><span>global</span> <span>add_values</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> src</span><span>,</span><span> src2</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This is an important line as it defines a C function called “add_values”.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let’s go through each item one at a time:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The next parameter shows it has two function arguments.</li>
<li>The parameter after that shows that we’ll use two GPRs for the arguments. In some cases we might want to use more GPRs so we have to tell x86util we need more.</li>
<li>The parameter after that tells x86util how many XMM registers we are going to use.</li>
<li>The following two parameters are labels for the function arguments.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">It’s worth noting that older code may not have labels for the function arguments but instead address GPRs directly using r0, r1 etc.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    movu  m0, [srcq]  
    movu  m1, [src2q]"><pre><span>    movu  m0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>srcq</span><span>]</span><span>  </span>
<span>    movu  m1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>src2q</span><span>]</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">movu is shorthand for movdqu (move double quad unaligned). Alignment will be covered in another lesson but for now movu can be treated as a 128-bit move from [srcq]. In the case of mov, the brackets mean that the address in [srcq] is being dereferenced, the equivalent of *<em>src in C.</em> This is what’s known as a load. Note that the “q” suffix refers to the size of the pointer *(*i.e in C it represents *sizeof(*src) == 8 on 64-bit systems, and x86asm is smart enough to use 32-bit on 32-bit systems) but the underlying load is 128-bit.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that we don’t refer to vector registers by their full name, in this case xmm0,but as m0, an abstracted form. In future lessons you’ll see how this means you can write code once and have it work on multiple SIMD register sizes.</p>

<p dir="auto">paddb (read this in your head as <em>p-add-b</em>) is adding each byte in each register as shown below. The “p” prefix stands for “packed” and is used to identify vector instructions vs scalar instructions. The “b” suffix shows that this is bytewise addition (addition of bytes).</p>

<p dir="auto">This is what’s known as a store. The data is written back to the address in the srcq pointer.</p>

<p dir="auto">This is a macro to denote the function returns. Virtually all assembly functions in FFmpeg modify the data in the arguments as opposed to returning a value.</p>
<p dir="auto">As you’ll see in the assignment, we create function pointers to assembly functions and use them where available.</p>

Decades of relationships are being strained in the attempt of mending ties with a state that never really did much to advance America's interests in the modern era.

                  <p>I said this else where, but, dramatic foreign policy shifts and realignments only make the U.S. even less attractive as an ally and a partner.
Decades of relationships are being strained in the attempt of mending ties with a state that never really did much to advance America's interests in the modern era. And it could all be completely undone in four years. The whip lash of back and forth, radical shifts in policy, are as damaging as the acts that directly alienate America's global partners.</p>

                  <p>LLMs are something everybody can reproduce with enough money, as shown by Musk itself recently: in one year they have Grok3 which is a SOTA model, without having particular talents or innovations, just following the recipe everybody else is using (and this is why you see new companies competing with established companies: all are training transformers with a lot of tokens, basically). So Europe can have their LLMs as well: the important thing is to relax this stupid AI act, that the biggest countries in Europe didn't want (Germany, France, Italy) but that somewhat passed (and it is not impossible that there are external influences and corruptions). About the search engine: Google at this point is almost a joke, to the point it is simpler to redo it right than trying to fix it from the internal. Remember that a lot of key technologies are created by europeans: from Python to Linux, to MySQL and so on. Europe has all the potential needed <i>if the right choices are made</i> to do everything needed.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="articleBody"><section><p>TALLAHASSEE — While Florida insurers claimed to be losing money in the wake of hurricanes Irma and Michael, their parent companies and affiliates were making billions of dollars, according to a study obtained by the Times/Herald.</p><p>The start of the state’s insurance market meltdown came on the heels of those two storms between 2017 and 2019, as companies justified big rate increases to cover their losses.</p><p>But those financial hardships don’t tell the full story, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25540452-affiliated-fee-analysis-executive-summary/" target="_blank">according to the 2022 study</a> that has never been made public and was released to the Times/Herald after a two-year wait for public records.</p><p>The report, the most in-depth dive into the byzantine finances of Florida’s homeowners insurance market, reveals that as the industry was ailing and companies were losing money, executives distributed $680 million in dividends to shareholders while diverting billions more to affiliate companies.</p><p>Executives with most Florida-based insurers were removing so much money from<b> </b>their companies that they violated state regulations, the study’s author concluded.</p><p>The result left some insurers financially weaker — and potentially unable to pay claims — heading into the depths of the state’s insurance crisis.</p><p>State lawmakers never saw the report.</p><p>The state’s then-insurance commissioner and Gov. Ron DeSantis focused on legal reforms making it harder to sue insurers.</p><p>And regulators have not repeated the study since, despite <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25540452-affiliated-fee-analysis-executive-summary/" target="_blank">a recommendation from the report’s author</a>.</p><p>The findings are a “smoking gun” that confirms what <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/12/11/property-insurance-compensation-executives-legislature-special-session/" target="_blank">has long been suspected in Florida’s market</a>, said Doug Quinn, executive director of the watchdog American Policyholder Association.</p><p>“These companies are crying poverty in order to raise premiums or justify insolvency: ‘It’s litigation, it’s fraud,‘” Quinn said. “This is money shifting from their left pocket to the right, and crying poverty while their right pocket bulges.”</p><p>State regulators say the insurance market is different today. In recent years, Florida Insurance Commissioner Mike Yaworsky <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2023/04/28/florida-legislature-insurance-insolvencies-premiums-profits/" target="_blank">has pushed for more oversight of affiliate companies</a>. This year, he’s asking lawmakers to change how insurers pay affiliates.</p><p>While the report is an incomplete picture of insurers' money,<b> </b>Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation said in a statement, the study affirms that the reforms the office wants are warranted.</p><p>But<b> </b>Paul Handerhan, founder of the trade group Federal Association for Insurance Reform, whose members include insurance companies,<b> </b>disputed the idea that executives were deliberately moving money around.</p><p>“This notion that they’re fleecing their policyholders and offshoring the money to their affiliates is just not happening,” Handerhan said. “None of these guys did this as a strategy.”</p><p>During debates in the Legislature over how best to respond to the insurance crisis between 2018 and 2023, some lawmakers asked what role affiliate companies played.</p><p>Rep. Hillary Cassel, R-Dania Beach, said lawmakers and observers had a lack of data about affiliates, known in the industry as “managing general agents,” when they were voting on legislation.</p><p>“All of us informed on the issues knew (managing general agents) were a problem,” said Cassel, a former lawyer for insurance companies who now sues them.</p><p>The Office of Insurance Regulation said in a statement that the study was not given to lawmakers because it was “not a formal examination report.”<b> </b>It was produced months before lawmakers met in emergency legislative sessions in 2022 and left in a “draft” status.</p><p>“Our office does not release every internal analysis of companies to the Legislature,” the office said.</p><p>The Times/Herald requested the report in November 2022, but the office did not turn over the executive summary until December 2024.</p><p>The affiliate structure is nothing new in Florida.</p><p>Profits of insurance companies are limited by regulators to about 4.5% — hardly enticing to investors, considering the risk of hurricanes.</p><p>However, insurance executives in Florida have used financial workarounds to reward investors and themselves.</p><p>While the profits and executive compensation of the insurance company are capped, the profits of affiliate and parent companies are not.</p><p>So executives create sister companies that charge the insurance company for basic services, such as claims handling, underwriting, accounting and issuing policies. (Large national insurers typically handle all of those services internally.)</p><p>Arrangements between insurance companies and affiliates must be approved by the state, and regulations say they must be “fair and reasonable,” which isn’t defined in state law.</p><p>Company structures can appear like a spiderweb of entities. When FedNat Insurance went insolvent in 2022, it was <a href="https://myfloridacfo.com/docs-sf/rehabilitation-and-liquidation-libraries/rehab-documents/insolvency-reports/pc/fednat-insurance-company---2025.pdf?sfvrsn=61714f67_2" target="_blank">one of nine corporations under a parent company</a>.</p><p>When Southern Fidelity Insurance dissolved that year, it was <a href="https://myfloridacfo.com/docs-sf/rehabilitation-and-liquidation-libraries/rehab-documents/insolvency-reports/pc/southern-fidelity-insurance-company---2024.pdf?sfvrsn=52789be4_1" target="_blank">one of six companies under the same umbrella</a>, and its holdings included a hunting lodge maintained at a cost of $485,000 per year. State officials were investigating whether the company “took active measures to conceal these costs” from regulators, according to an October insolvency report.</p><p>Most insurers in Florida have similar arrangements, which are enormously lucrative for some executives who were the <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/2081759374?sourcetype=Trade%20Journals" target="_blank">highest-paid in the nation in some years</a>.</p><p>But this type of setup can be easily abused and requires greater regulatory scrutiny, according to the <a href="https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/publications-fah.pdf" target="_blank">National Association of Insurance Commissioners</a>.</p><p>That’s because the owner of the insurance company also owns the affiliates, creating an incentive for executives to overcharge the insurance company for services.</p><p>Such abuses have been <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/12/11/property-insurance-compensation-executives-legislature-special-session/" target="_blank">repeatedly found by state officials as the reason why companies go insolvent</a>. In one 2009 insolvency, auditors wrote that executives were “stripping the company of cash” as it was going out of business. The ratings agency AM Best last year found that affiliate relationships<b> </b>were the third-leading cause of insolvencies nationwide between 2000 and 2022, <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2024/12/18/805231.htm" target="_blank">after catastrophe losses and fraud, Insurance Journal reported</a>.</p><p>Still,<b> </b>it’s unlikely Florida<b> </b>regulators knew the full scope of insurance money-shifting arrangements until 2021, when lawmakers <a href="http://laws.flrules.org/files/Ch_2021-077.pdf" target="_blank">gave them the ability</a> to demand more information from insurers and affiliates.</p><p>Using that power,<b> </b>the state’s then-commissioner, David Altmaier, paid a Connecticut-based consultant<b> </b>nearly $150,000<b> </b>to parse through the information the companies provided. Several companies turned over incomplete data, according to the study.</p><p>Between 2017 and 2019, the insurers in the study (minus a couple of outliers) showed a net loss of $432 million.</p><p>Their affiliate companies showed a net income of $1.8 billion.</p><p>With all 53 companies included, the industry recorded $61 million in net income, and affiliates made about $14 billion in net income, according to the study. Those figures likely include national carriers that also provide auto insurance.</p><p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25540452-affiliated-fee-analysis-executive-summary/" target="_blank">The author noted</a> that the affiliates of Florida-based companies were profitable even after they injected<b> </b>$485 million back into the insurers and<b> </b>waived $208 million in fees during the three years, steps made to help keep the insurers afloat.</p><p>In the author’s opinion, 19 of the 30 Florida-based companies that provided data were paying fees<b> </b>to their affiliate companies that were “not fair and reasonable.”</p><p>The numbers in the study are “eye-popping” and raise questions about why regulators would allow such financial arrangements, said Birny Birnbaum, executive director of the Center for Economic Justice and a former chief economist at the Texas Department of Insurance.</p><p>“It’s unclear why (the Office of Insurance Regulation) isn’t doing anything about it,” Birnbaum said.</p><p>Regulators this year are asking lawmakers to define “fair and reasonable” to include the actual cost of the service provided, the overall health of the insurer and how much in dividends were paid out. Regulators asked for that in 2023 <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2023/04/28/florida-legislature-insurance-insolvencies-premiums-profits/" target="_blank">but lawmakers rejected it</a>, claiming it would “upset the apple cart” of Florida’s insurance industry.</p><p>The office’s proposed legislation would also require fees to affiliates be paid in dollar amounts, instead of percentages. Affiliates will typically charge the insurance company fees of between 20% and 34% of premiums, which results in more money for the affiliates when premiums go up.</p><p>The office has canceled or modified some companies’ agreements. In 2023, for example, one company’s contract with an affiliate was canceled after regulators discovered that the affiliate was charging the insurer additional fees on top of the cost of the services being provided, according to the office.</p></section></article></div>]]></description>

The bonus was raised from 75 percent of base salary to a whopping 200 percent, effective with the 2025 annual performance period.</p>
<p>"Following this increase, the target total cash compensation for the named executive officers (other than the CEO) falls at approximately the 50th percentile of the Peer Group Target Cash Compensation," the filing notes. It added that prior to the adjustment, those executives were only at or below the 15th percentile in total cash compensation compared to their peers.&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>According to Meta's April 2024 proxy <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/8c7f110d-9cc4-4034-b356-ece89d4cb1c5.pdf" rel="nofollow">statement</a> [PDF], CTO Andrew Bosworth's base salary was $945,000. His actual eligible earnings were slightly lower due to the timing of his raise. However, factoring in a 75 percent target bonus and Meta's 150 percent company performance multiplier for 2023, his total bonus payout amounted to about $1.05 million.</p>

        


        

<p>Assuming Bosworth's salary remains the same, and Meta's company performance percentage stays at 150 percent in 2025, the new 200 percent target bonus would push his bonus to nearly $3 million. That's before any stock-based compensation and other add-ons. And he's not even the highest-paid member of Meta's named executive team.</p>
<p>For balance's sake, and some might find this hard to swallow but, $3 million annual cash compensation for a CTO in Bosworth's position is about right for Silicon Valley; it's nothing outrageous, relatively speaking. The vast majority of his pay package is in shares; in 2023 for instance, he was awarded more than $20 million in stock. The salary, like for many in his role, is the cherry on top of an enormous cake.</p>

        

<p>Some of that bonus cash, though, might be coming from Meta's latest round of layoffs, which saw <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/10/meta_to_toss_5_of/">around 3,700 people</a> - about five percent of its workforce - axed this month. The cut reportedly targeted low performers, and followed a year in which the biz reported a net income of $62.36 billion, a 59 percent year-over-year increase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This comes <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/67a4c030-a7f6-47af-bab0-a998f0a09506" rel="nofollow">reports</a> surfaced this week that Meta has cut back on its yearly distribution of stock options by 10 percent to most staff, though we do note that the corp's share price has climbed 10 percent in the past month, and 46 percent for the past year.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Meta to confirm reports of the stock option cut.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zuckerberg started 2025 by describing Meta's plans for the year as "intense," with massive AI investments lined up as the Facebook maker shifts focus beyond its struggling <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/10/meta_metaverse_report/">metaverse</a> ambitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following OpenAI's announcement that it and its partners plan to invest up to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/22/openai_stargate_ai_datacenter_company/">$500 billion</a> in an AI infrastructure project dubbed Stargate, Zuckerberg announced his own AI spending plans - Meta would pour $60 billion or more to expand its AI infrastructure in 2025.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>"This is a massive effort, and over the coming years it will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation, and extend American technology leadership," Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/pfbid0219ude255AKkmk4JAueXZeZ9zpjNYio2tBkd7bNmCaRbJ6iJaVVjypUgDg78CNdq5l" rel="nofollow">said</a> of the effort. Hopefully it will prove more successful than that Metaverse shift for the sake of those executives' bonuses.&nbsp;®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="c1"><p>When I was still a professional programmer, my office-mate once asked out of the blue, "Do you really want to be doing this kind of work when you're fifty?"</p><p>I have to say that made me stop and think.</p><p>To me, there's an innate frustration in programming. It doesn't stem from having to work out the solutions to difficult problems. That takes careful thought, but it's the same kind of thought a novelist uses to organize a story or to write dialog that rings true. That kind of problem-solving is satisfying, even fun.</p><p>But that, unfortunately, is not what most programming is about. It's about trying to come up with a working solution in a problem domain that you don't fully understand and don't have time to understand.</p><p>It's about skimming <a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/129.html">great oceans of APIs</a> that you could spend years studying and learning, but the market will have moved on by then and that's no fun anyway, so you cut and paste from examples and manage to get by without a full picture of the architecture supporting your app.</p><p>It's about reading between the lines of documentation and guessing at how edge cases are handled and whether or not your assumptions will still hold true two months or two years from now.</p><p>It's about the constant evolutionary changes that occur in the language definition, the compiler, the libraries, the application framework, and the underlying operating system, that all snowball together and keep you in maintenance mode instead of making real improvements. </p><p>It's about getting derailed by hairline fractures in otherwise reliable tools, and apparently being the first person to discover that a PNG image with four bits-per-pixel and an alpha channel crashes the decoder, then having to work around that.</p><p>One approach is to dig in and power through all the obstacles. If you're fresh out of school, there are free Starbucks lattes down the hall, and all your friends are still at the office at 2 AM, too...well, that works. But then you have to do it again. And again. It's always a last second skid at 120 miles per hour with brakes smoking and tires shredding that makes all the difference between success and failure, but you pulled off another miracle and survived to do it again.</p><p>I still like to build things, and if there's no one else to do it, then I'll do it myself. I keep improving the <a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/77.html">the tiny Perl script</a> that puts together this site, because that tiny Perl script is unobtrusive and reliable and lets me focus on writing. I have a handy little image compositing tool that's less than 28 kilobytes of C and Erlang source. I know how it works inside and out, and I can make changes to it in less time than than it takes to coax what I want out of ImageMagick.</p><p>But large scale, high stress coding? I may have to admit that's a young man's game.</p><p><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/154.html" id="perm">permalink</a> <i>October 3, 2012</i></p><h2>previously</h2><ul><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/153.html">Digging Out from Years of Homogeneous Computing</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/152.html">What's Your Hidden Agenda?</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/151.html">Minimalism in an Age of Tremendous Hardware</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/150.html">The Goal is to be Like a Bad Hacker Movie</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/149.html">Hopefully More Controversial Programming Opinions</a></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Michael is in his late 50s and is among the millions of people in the UK who cannot or do not want to use mobile apps, and feels he is being penalised for his choice.</p><p>He does own a smartphone – an Apple iPhone he bought secondhand about three years ago – but says: “I don’t use apps at all. I don’t download them for security reasons.”</p><p>Apps have burrowed their way into seemingly every aspect of our lives and there are lots of reasons why companies are pushing us to use them. With an app, it is often “one click and you’re in”, rather than having to faff around online finding the website and remembering passwords. It is also for the “push notifications” that mobile apps send to grab our attention and get us to buy stuff. Many tech experts also argue that apps are generally more secure than websites and allow banks and others to carry out sophisticated ID verification using face, voice and fingerprint biometrics.</p><p>But millions of people who cannot afford a smartphone or have an older device that does not support some services are increasingly being locked out of deals, discounts and even some vital services, say digital exclusion and pro-cash campaigners.</p><p>They are missing out on everything from savings on their weekly shop, to some of the best interest rates for their cash. And not signing up to the app revolution is making activities including paying for parking and going to concerts increasingly challenging.</p><p>“It’s the tyranny of the apps,” says Ron Delnevo, the chair of the campaign committee at lobby group the <a href="https://www.paymentchoicealliance.org/" data-link-name="in body link">Payment Choice Alliance</a>. “In this country we’re being treated like sheep,” he says. “We’re always being told there’s no alternative.” But when a new smartphone can set you back hundreds of pounds, it is “an expensive passport to participate”, Delnevo says.</p><p>According to the latest data from the telecoms regulator Ofcom, 8% of people aged 16 or over do not have a smartphone, which for the UK translates into just under 4.5 million people. Among those aged 75-plus, the proportion is said to be 28%. Add in all those who don’t or can’t use apps and the total number of people affected is a lot bigger.</p><p>Lots of retailers offer enhanced or exclusive deals to their app users, and some run loyalty schemes through them. This is potentially a big deal as those schemes often give you access to discounts that are not otherwise available.</p><p>“Some people are missing out on lower prices offered by loyalty schemes as they do not have access to phones or smart devices to download apps,” Reena Sewraz, the retail editor at Which? says.</p><p>The consumer group is among those to have highlighted Lidl’s loyalty scheme, Lidl Plus, as one that is only accessible via an app, with an email address also required. That means the “big savings” available via the scheme’s weekly offers – at the time of writing these included 25% off tinned tuna and 20% off microwave rice and grain pouches – plus various coupons and rewards, are off-limits to those who cannot or do not wish to go digital.</p><p>Delnevo says Lidl is “disenfranchising” many of its customers, adding: “The people who probably need the discounts most are the people who can’t afford or don’t have a smartphone.”</p><p>In response, the supermarket chain says the Lidl Plus scheme “forms part of our commitment to providing customers with the best value. Nonetheless, we remain mindful of those who don’t have access to a smartphone or tablet and continue to offer in-store promotions through our ‘pick of the&nbsp;week’ offers.”</p><p>Rival supermarket Asda also runs a scheme, Asda Rewards, where you have to download an app and there is no physical card available. This scheme does not offer price promotions – instead, you earn Asda “pounds” when you shop, which you convert into vouchers to spend in-store and online.</p><p>Some retailers have gone further down the app path than others. The Boots Advantage card scheme, one of the UK’s most popular, still lets you use a physical plastic card, although there are “tailored offers” available via the app.</p><figure id="71b82c96-b4ae-45cb-905e-4e30a50a1b58" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Customers with pastries and coffee in a Greggs bakery" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="267" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>At Greggs you get a free hot drink just for downloading the app.</span> Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>And at the bakery chain Greggs, you can collect loyalty “stamps” for free food and drink and&nbsp;get “exclusive app-only gifts”.&nbsp;You currently get a free hot drink just for downloading the app.</p><p>Meanwhile, the online clothes retailer Asos and the tools and hardware specialist Screwfix are just two of those that are or have recently been running “app exclusive” campaigns.

There are easy alternatives … including the PayByPhone app, phone or text, and cash payments at over 100 local&nbsp;PayPoint retailers.”</p><h2 id="entertainment"><strong>Entertainment</strong></h2><p>Increasingly with gigs and other events, you need to download an app to access your tickets.</p><p>For example, tickets for some events at the O2 arena in London are delivered as a “mobile ID” via the venue’s own app, and you get a barcode which is scanned to let you in.</p><p>This type of app-based mobile ID system is also billed as the only admission method at venues including Ovo Arena Wembley in London and University of Wolverhampton at The Halls.</p><figure id="b3a9c6e9-19de-4ba4-bd47-d3d6258cf385" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d01462a76cfed6e254cb9ccd4844cc4a9ec8241/0_342_5318_3192/master/5318.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d01462a76cfed6e254cb9ccd4844cc4a9ec8241/0_342_5318_3192/master/5318.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d01462a76cfed6e254cb9ccd4844cc4a9ec8241/0_342_5318_3192/master/5318.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d01462a76cfed6e254cb9ccd4844cc4a9ec8241/0_342_5318_3192/master/5318.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d01462a76cfed6e254cb9ccd4844cc4a9ec8241/0_342_5318_3192/master/5318.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d01462a76cfed6e254cb9ccd4844cc4a9ec8241/0_342_5318_3192/master/5318.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="James Bay sings and plays guitar on stage at the OVO Arena in London" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d01462a76cfed6e254cb9ccd4844cc4a9ec8241/0_342_5318_3192/master/5318.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="267.1004136893569" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>James Bay at the OVO Arena in London, where an app-based system is billed as the only admission method.</span> Photograph: Gus Stewart/Redferns</figcaption></figure><p>That said, the venue websites do usually provide details of how people who do not have a smartphone or cannot download the app can gain entry to their event – but it might involve bringing photo ID and your confirmation email to the box office perhaps 90 minutes before the doors open.</p><p>When it comes to theatre, popular services such as TodayTix offer savings on tickets and can be accessed online, although to take advantage of some of the benefits and offers, such as discounted same-day “Rush” tickets, you need to have the app.</p><h2 id="eating-and-drinking"><strong>Eating and drinking</strong></h2><p>Those who cannot or do not use apps are missing out on some of the best deals for meals, takeaways and pub grub.</p><p>McDonald’s is running a high-profile promotion called Deal Drop, where it offers items at “bargain” prices, such as a classic Big Mac for £1.49 (normally £4.99) and a children’s Happy Meal for £1.99 (normally £3.59) – but all of the discounts are available exclusively with the<strong> </strong>company’s app.</p><p>The fastfood chain Subway runs a loyalty scheme where you earn points that you can convert into “Subway Cash” that can be spent on anything on the menu – but again it is app-only.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div fs-toc-element="contents" fs-richtext-element="rich-text"><p>Every February we see a big spike in retailers running sneaker launches on EQL to coincide with the 2025 NBA All-Star Weekend. This year, the festivities kicked off a little earlier than normal, courtesy of Jordan Brand, who have been getting serious about getting back their mojo and dropping some serious heat in the process. This year marks 40 years since a talented rookie by the name of Michael Jordan wore his signature shoes at the 1985 All-Star Dunk Contest in a colorway that is now firmly ingrained in sneaker culture lore. To mark the occasion, Jordan Brand recreated the shoe in what they say is the closest to OG spec ever. Sneakerheads have been anticipating the drop for months and the demand was predictably crazy.</p><p>At first, everything appeared to be going smoothly. Thousands of entries were rolling in, bots were being neutralized, winners were being picked and notified, but as we started notifying non-winners that they’d missed out, things got weird.</p><p>We started seeing reports of people being told that they had <em>won and lost in the same email…</em> the Schrödinger’s cat of bug reports. What on earth was going on??</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63f4b950d4ba499d292a5807/67b6501b3cd8c968f609f0d6_Screenshot1.webp" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63f4b950d4ba499d292a5807/67b650268e295d42fbd80cf9_Screenshot2.webp" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now, we’re accustomed to a baseline level of crazy – it comes with the territory of running some of the hottest product launches on the internet. Having a 24/7 support team who can bring calm to the chaos is big reason why brands work with EQL. But even for us, this one felt odd.</p><p>Fans were reporting that their email app was listing ”You’ve been selected” but when they clicked on the email it displayed the heartbreaking “SORRY” non-winner message. Sneaker fans are a passionate bunch, and online launches often trigger the full range of human emotions - to put it mildly! People were understandably mad about the confusing messaging.</p><p>When things heat up, it’s helpful to have a community you can turn to. We operate in a space where people sometimes troll for fun – or profit, like the <a href="https://x.com/EQLofficial/status/1632861398425559041">time</a> someone tried to pretend they’d won 750 pairs of the <a href="https://tiffany.runfair.com/en-GB/us/niketiffany-air-force-1-1837">Nike/Tiffany Air Force 1 1837</a> to pump a cookgroup.</p><p>We reached out to our <a href="https://discord.com/servers/eql-1136853080487514182">Discord community</a>, who confirmed that the issue was real and shared some more screenshots:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63f4b950d4ba499d292a5807/67b6505e233e0e61481beccc_Screenshots3.webp" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The bizarre thing is that our winner emails don’t actually say “You’ve been selected”. As an on-call engineer, this is the point when you start questioning your life choices. You know that the issue is affecting thousands of users, but the offending phrase doesn’t appear anywhere in EQL’s codebase, aside from some very old launches several years ago.</p><p>As more screenshots poured in, another odd thing jumped out – the winning phrase seemed to change from email to email. Some said “selected <em>to purchase </em>JORDAN AJ1”, others said “selected <em>for the </em>JORDAN AJ1”:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63f4b950d4ba499d292a5807/67b6507dc983919b3c85a7df_Screenshot4.webp" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>By this point, we’d narrowed down the affected users to a single email client - <strong>Yahoo Mail</strong>, which is where we got suspicious. Had Yahoo Mail introduced any features lately that might be causing this…?</p><p>As it turns out, yes, yes they had. A quick Google search revealed that a few months ago Yahoo jumped on the AI craze with the launch of ”<a href="https://www.yahooinc.com/press/yahoo-mail-launches-a-new-app-experience-with-mobile-first-ai-features"><strong>AI-generated, one-line email summaries”</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>At this point, the penny dropped. Just like Apple AI <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/16/media/apple-ai-news-fake-headlines/index.html">generating fake news summaries</a>, Yahoo AI was hallucinating the fake winner messages, presumably as a result of training their model on our old emails. Worse, they were putting an untrustworthy AI summary in the exact place that users expect to see an email subject, with no mention of it being AI-generated 🤯</p><p>Some people use Yahoo Mail to read emails from other providers like Gmail, so this issue hit a broad range of sneaker fans. And it’s worth mentioning that as of the time of writing, <strong>this AI feature is still live in Yahoo Mail</strong>, so more confusion is expected in future – not just for sneaker fans receiving launch results, but for anyone reading important emails in Yahoo Mail.</p><p>For EQL users, if you’re ever in doubt, you can always double-check your launch results in the <a href="https://app.eql.com/">fans app</a>, contact our support team (support@eql.com) or join our helpful <a href="https://discord.com/servers/eql-1136853080487514182">Discord community</a>. Until then, we’ll continue fighting the good fight to put products into the hands of real fans and trying to prevent bad AI from ruining your day! 🤖</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>WHAT IS A COMPUTER CLUB?</h2>
<p>a computer club is where a group of people hang out and do computer together</p>

<h2>WHAT IS "DOING COMPUTER"?</h2>
<p>doing computer is whatever you want...on computers, together. our bias is towards programming and <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> diy </span> shared computing infrastructure. but there's also art and music and open data science and circuit-bending and a million other things we don't know about</p>

<h2>WHY SHOULD I START A COMPUTER CLUB?</h2>
<p>the political economy of computing is awful. have you read <a dir="ltr" lang="en" href="https://bookwyrm.social/book/525851/s/palo-alto"> palo alto</a>? me neither. we should read it. we deserve better than the <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> darpa-funded </span> visions of <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> xerox parc </span> technologists</p>
<p>make the political economy of computing less awful and bring it home to you and yours by starting a computer club in the place that you live</p>

<h2>RULES</h2>
<p>we can't make you do anything, so do whatever you want. but these are the things we think are really important</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>hang out in real life:</strong> online has rude vibes, real life has kinder vibes. hang out in real life for trust and strength and to ground your computer club in your actual local context</li>
    <li><strong>reject corporate sponsorship:</strong> corporate sponsorship constrains behavior and undermines collective ownership. computer club isn't yours if a corporate sponsor might get upset by something you do</li>
    <li><strong>computer club is a collective project:</strong> you don't need a mission statement, but you might have an ethos that defines your computer club. computer club is beholden only to that ethos and the people who show up</li>
</ul>

<h2>GUIDELINES</h2>
<p>we still can't make you do anything, so continue doing whatever you want. but these are things we think are important to think about</p>
<ul>
    <li>computing is political, so let computer club be political too</li>
    <li>the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/social-rules"><span dir="ltr" lang="en"> recurse center </span> social rules</a> foster collaboration and psychological safety, consider using them</li>
    <li>be inspired by permaculture</li>
    <li>be inspired by small web</li>
    <li>be inspired by <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> diy </span> culture</li>
    <li>be inspired by computing as a medium through which better things are possible</li>
    <li>try to host computer club's stuff on your own computers in the place that you live</li>
    <li>be open to interdisciplinary computing</li>
    <li>be open to different histories and "skill levels" with computing</li>
</ul>

<h2>HOW SHOULD I START THE COMPUTER CLUB</h2>
<p>there are lots of ways to start a computer club; how you start will be unique to yours. but you could try</p>
<ul>
    <li>talk about what used to excite you about doing computer. talk about how the political economy of computing could be better. talk about these things publicly. the computer club might already be breathing in the communities you're in</li>
    <li>attend preexisting computing meetups and find like-minded people. meetups about "how to <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> node.js </span> apolitically" are sidelining people who want "how to <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> node.js </span> pro-socially." don't try to be a recruiter -- just be excited at events and find people who are also excited</li>
    <li>does your city have a food coop? food coops and computer clubs have a similar ethos; and food coops are a great place to get your food for the same reasons that a computer club is a great place to do computer. make friends at your food coop and find the computer-doers</li>
    <li>join a project or start a project and talk to people there about starting a computer club. are you or someone you know doing<ul>
        <li>web design for a <span dir="ltr" lang="en"> diy </span> venue? work together!</li>
        <li>technical support for a cool local project? work together!</li>
        <li>communications for your neighborhood's nascent mesh network? work together!</li>
        <li>analysis for local open data projects? work together!</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>talk to existing computer clubs!</li>
</ul>

<p>I released version 1 of my <a href="https://www.perfecttableplan.com/">table seating planning software</a>, PerfectTablePlan, in February 2005. 20 years ago this month. It was a different world. A world of Windows, shareware and CDs. A lot has changed since then, but PerfectTablePlan is now at version 7 and still going strong.</p>

<p>PerfectTablePlan v7</p>



<p>I have released several other products since then, and done some training and consulting, but PerfectTablePlan remains my most successful product. It’s success is due to a lot of hard work, and a certain amount of dumb luck.</p>



<p>I was getting married and I volunteered to do the seating plan for our wedding reception. It sounded like a relatively straightforward optimization problem, as we only had 60 guests and no family feuds to worry about. But it was surprisingly difficult to get right. I looked around for some software to help me. There were a couple of software packages, but I wasn’t impressed. I could do better myself! So I wrote a (very rough) first version, which I used for our wedding.</p>



<p>Things weren’t going great at my day job, at a small software startup. Maybe I could commercialize my table planner? I was a bit wary, as my potential competitors all seemed rather moribund and I didn’t think I would be able to make a living off it. But I thought I could do everything worth doing in 6-12 months and then start on the next product. Wrong on both counts!</p>



<p>Web-based software was still in its infancy in 2005. So I decided to write it as desktop software using C++ and cross-platform framework Qt, which I had plenty of experience in. Initially, I just released a Windows version. But I later added a Mac version as well. Qt has had its commercial ups and downs in the last 20 years, but it has grown with me and is now very robust, comprehensive and well documented. I think I made a good choice.</p>



<p>I financed PerfectTablePlan out of my own savings and it has been profitable every year since version 1 was launched. I could have taken on employees and grown the business, but I preferred to keep it as a <a href="https://successfulsoftware.net/2013/11/06/lifestyle-programming/">lifestyle business</a>. My wife does the accounts and proof reading and I do nearly everything else, with a bit of help from my accountant, web designers and a few other contractors. I don’t regret that decision. 20 years without meetings, ties or alarm clocks. My son was born 18 months after PerfectTablePlan was launched and it has been great to have the flexibility to be fully present as a Dad.</p>



<p>CDs, remember them? I sent out around 5,000 CDs (with some help from my father), before I stopped shipping CDs in 2016.</p>

<p>During the lifetime of PerfectTablePlan it became clear that things were increasingly moving to the web. But I couldn’t face rewriting PerfectTablePlan from scratch for the web. Javascript. Ugh. Also PerfectTablePlan is quite compute intensive, using a genetic algorithm to generate an automated seating plan and I felt it was better running this on the customer’s local computers than my server. And some of my customers consider their seating plans to be confidential and don’t want to store them on third party servers. So I decided to stick with desktop. But, if I was starting PerfectTablePlan from scratch now, I might make a different decision.</p>



<p>Plenty of strange and wonderful things have happened over the last 20 years, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>PerfectTablePlan has been used by some very famous organizations for some very famous events (which we mostly don’t have permission to mention). It has seated royalty, celebrities and heads of state.</li>



<li>PerfectTablePlan was used as part of a <a href="https://www.perfecttableplan.com/newsletters/newsletter10_web.html">demonstration of the (controversial) first commercial quantum computer by D-Wave</a>.</li>



<li>A mock-up of PerfectTablePlan, including icons I did myself, was <a href="https://www.perfecttableplan.com/newsletters/newsletter_8.html">used without our permission</a> by Sony in their ‘Big day’ TV comedy series. I threated them with legal action. Years later, I am still awaiting a reply.</li>



<li>I got to grapple with some interesting problems, including the mathematics of <a href="https://www.perfecttableplan.com/html/genetic_algorithm.html">large combinatorial problems</a> and <a href="https://successfulsoftware.net/2008/07/18/a-mathematical-digression/">elliptical tables</a>. Some customers have seated 4,000 guests and 4000! (4000x3999x3998 .. x 1) is a mind-bogglingly huge number.</li>



<li>A well known wedding magazine ran a promotion with a valid licence key clearly visible in a photograph of a PerfectTablePlan CD. I worked through the night to release a new version of PerfectTablePlan that didn’t work with this key.</li>



<li>I found out that <a href="https://www.perfecttableplan.com/html/the_dog_ate_my_cd.html">CDs are edible</a>.</li>



<li>I sponsored the <a href="https://thejunipertrust.org/jt_projects/bampti-kindergaten-school/">building of a kindergarten in Nepal</a>.</li>



<li>I once had to stay up late, in a state of some inebriation, to fix an issue so that a world famous event wasn’t a disaster (no I can’t tell you the event).</li>
</ul>



<p>The lowest point was the pandemic, when sales pretty much dropped to zero.</p>



<p>Competitors and operating systems have come and gone and the ecosystem for software has changed a lot, but PerfectTablePlan is still here and still paying the bills. It is about 145,000 lines of C++. Some of the code is a bit ugly and not how I would write it now. But the product is very solid, with very few bugs. The website and user documentation are also substantial pieces of work. The PDF version of the documentation is nearly 500 pages.</p>



<p>I now divide my time between PerfectTablePlan and my 2 other products: <a href="https://www.easydatatransform.com/">data wrangling software</a> Easy Data Transform and <a href="https://www.hyperplan.com/">visual planner</a> Hyper Plan. Having multiple products keeps things varied and avoids having all my eggs in one basket. In May 2024 I released PerfectTablePlan v7 with a load of improvements and new features. And I have plenty of ideas for future improvements. I fully expect to keep working on PerfectTablePlan until I retire (I’m 59 now).</p>

      <div>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
              We propose an efficient radiance field rendering algorithm that incorporates a rasterization process on adaptive sparse voxels without neural networks or 3D Gaussians. There are two key contributions coupled with the proposed system. The first is to adaptively and explicitly allocate sparse voxels to different levels of detail within scenes, faithfully reproducing scene details with 65536<sup>3</sup> grid resolution while achieving high rendering frame rates. Second, we customize a rasterizer for efficient adaptive sparse voxels rendering. We render voxels in the correct depth order by using ray direction-dependent Morton ordering, which avoids the well-known popping artifact found in Gaussian splatting. Our method improves the previous neural-free voxel model by over 4db PSNR and more than 10x FPS speedup, achieving state-of-the-art comparable novel-view synthesis results. Additionally, our voxel representation is seamlessly compatible with grid-based 3D processing techniques such as Volume Fusion, Voxel Pooling, and Marching Cubes, enabling a wide range of future extensions and applications.

          <h2>Adaptive Sparse Voxel Representation and Rendering</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Our scene representation is a hybrid of primitive and volumetric model.
              <strong>(a) Primitive component.</strong> We explicitly allocate voxels primitives to cover different scene level-of-details under an Octree layout. Note that we do not replicate a traditional Octree data structure with parent-child pointers or linear Octree. We only keep voxels at the Octree leaf nodes without any ancestor nodes.
              <strong>(b) Volumetric component.</strong> Inside a voxel is a volumetric (trilinear) density field and a (constant) spherical harmonic field. We sample K points on the ray-voxel intersection segment to compute the intensity contribution from the voxel to the pixel with numerical integration.
            </p>
            <p><img src="https://svraster.github.io/images/representations.jpg">
            </p>
            <p>
              Adaptive level-of-details is crucial to scalability and quality. Sparse voxels with uniform voxel size can not scale up.
            </p>
            <p><img src="https://svraster.github.io/images/main_ablation.jpg">
            </p>
            <p>
              We sort voxels by ray direction-dependent Morton order, which ensures correct primitive blending order with mathematical proof. Sorting by primtive centers like 3DGS can produce inaccurate rendering.
              The inaccurate sorting causes 3DGS popping artifact (see left video below) while we don't have this issue (right video).

<p dir="auto">Slime OS is an app launcher for the <a href="https://collabs.shop/fca3j3" rel="nofollow">PicoVision</a> (and soon other RP2040 and RP2350 devices). It was originally designed for the <a href="https://youtu.be/rnwPmoWMGqk" rel="nofollow">Slimedeck Zero</a>, a mini cyberdeck project. However I hope to expand it to other devices and form factors.</p>

<p dir="auto">This software is experimental and does not work completely, specifically issues include...</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Input is only supported via an i2c keyboard, which is not documented (hoping to add USB keyboard soon)</li>
<li>Some apps are upside down due to the Slimedeck having the screen rotated 180 degrees. Newer apps use the <code>sos.graphics.*</code> methods which support the <code>display/flipped</code> value in <code>config.py</code>. Older apps use <code>self.display.*</code> and have wild math to rotate everything manually.</li>
<li>Everything is generally incomplete</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Hardware</h2><a id="user-content-hardware" aria-label="Permalink: Hardware" href="#hardware"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Currently this project uses a very specific set of hardware, however I'd like to expand it to support other RP2040 and RP2350 boards in the future. Feel free to do PRs to add more general hardware support.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Mainboard</h3><a id="user-content-mainboard" aria-label="Permalink: Mainboard" href="#mainboard"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This project is currently only tested on the <a href="https://collabs.shop/fca3j3" rel="nofollow">PicoVision</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Keyboard</h3><a id="user-content-keyboard" aria-label="Permalink: Keyboard" href="#keyboard"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The (currently) only support keyboard is based off this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IOZBNBC/?tag=boosteroven-20" rel="nofollow">XRT500 remote</a>. There are a few variants of this same "version" of remote, but I've only used this exact one.</p>
<p dir="auto">Along with the remote, you will need an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/732" rel="nofollow">MCP23017</a> to convert the key matrix to I2C. I have a few extra of the <a href="https://abe.today/products/mcp23017-port-expander-for-xrt500-tv-remote" rel="nofollow">keyboard PCBs available for sale</a>. You could also pick up an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5346" rel="nofollow">Adafruit MCP23017 board</a> and wire it to the keyboard PCB by hand.</p>
<p dir="auto">I would like to add more input types in the future.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Expansion Port</h3><a id="user-content-expansion-port" aria-label="Permalink: Expansion Port" href="#expansion-port"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The expansion port used on the Slimedeck is the <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0174/1800/files/DK925A-10M.pdf?v=1643016288" rel="nofollow">5-pin Dk925A-10M</a> which, as far as I can tell, are only <a href="https://collabs.shop/knlijz" rel="nofollow">sold via Pimoroni</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The pinout used for an expansion read left to right, with the edge connector facing you is...</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">5V - SDA/TX/CPU:GP0 - SCL/RX/CPU:GP1 - CTRL/GPU:GP29 - GND</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">A 4.7k resistor should be placed on the PicoVision connecting the GPU's GP29 to GND while the expansion side should place a 4.7k resistor between CTRL (GP29) and 5v.</p>
<p dir="auto">Although the plan is to eventually support various resistor values for different protocols / speeds, due to a design mistake this is not currently reliable. The PicoVision only has one ADC pin exposed (GPU:GP29) which is used as CTRL, however to reliably determine the value of the expansion resistor we also need a second ADC to act as a VREF (voltage reference) so we can determine the true voltage of our 5v line. As it stands if the 5v line is 5.2v or 4.9v due to load it may shift the value of our expansion voltage divider out of the expected range and the expansion may be incorrectly recognized. This is easily remidied with an external i2c ADC, but it is not currently implemented.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><strong>TLDR</strong>: <em>I wanted to generate an up-to-date disk image for a Rock Pi 4 using Yocto that included CUPS and Docker to both get a better understanding of Yocto and test the new SBOM generation feature.</em></p>

<p>As with many single-board computers (SBCs) from China, the issue often isn’t the board itself but rather the software. RockPi from Radxa is no exception. If you go and download the <a href="https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock4/downloads">latest disk images</a> for this board, you will notice that they are all end-of-life (EoL). However, these boards are still great and work very well for many applications. This should be top of mind if you are building a product that uses any of these devices.</p>

<p>I wanted to use one of the RockPi 4 boards I had for a simple print server. It’s not a customer product, of course, but let’s assume it was. Since it has the option to add eMMC storage, I find it more reliable than Raspberry Pi (I know the Raspberry Pi 5 allows for proper storage). However, given that I neither trust the Radxa disk images nor did I want to set things up on an already EoL Linux distribution, I started doing some digging. As it turns out, the RockPi is supported in Yocto.</p>

<p>Say what you want about Raspberry Pi, but you can still download an up-to-date OS that runs on the Pi 1.
In this article, I will show you not only how to build a disk image with Yocto (in this case for the Rock Pi 4, but it can easily be adjusted for other boards), but we will also talk a bit about how Yocto generates SBOMs (hint: it’s really clever) and where to find your SBOMs.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-yocto-anyways">What is Yocto anyways?</h2>

<p>The Yocto Project is an open-source framework for building custom Linux distributions tailored to embedded systems. It provides a flexible, modular build system based on BitBake and OpenEmbedded, enabling developers to create highly optimized and reproducible Linux images for specific hardware. Yocto is widely used in industries like automotive, IoT, and networking due to its ability to support diverse architectures and long-term maintenance needs. With its layered architecture, extensive BSP support, and strong focus on customization, Yocto is a powerful tool for developers looking to build and maintain embedded Linux systems efficiently.</p>

<p>I’ve toyed with it a few times over the years to build images for Raspberry Pis, but never really used it seriously. However, I recently crossed paths with some of the Yocto people in a CISA working group I’m co-chairing on <a href="https://github.com/CISA-SBOM-Community/SBOM-Generation">SBOM generation</a>. As it turns out, Yocto is very sophisticated when it comes to generating SBOMs, so I wanted to get some more up-to-date exposure to Yocto. Color me impressed. Not only did Yocto produce a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for me – it did so without even asking me.</p>

<p>Since Yocto builds everything from source and is essentially a package manager, it is able to capture all the dependencies into an SBOM. Moreover, since Yocto maintains detailed information about every dependency, it is able to generate very high-quality SBOMs.</p>

<h2 id="key-yocto-terminology">Key Yocto Terminology</h2>

<p>Before we dive in, here are some key terms in Yocto that you probably want to understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Poky</strong> – The reference distribution of the Yocto Project, containing the OpenEmbedded build system, BitBake, and a set of metadata</li>
  <li><strong>Scarthgap</strong> – The codename for the Yocto Project 5.0 release</li>
  <li><strong>Mickledore</strong> – The codename for Yocto 4.2</li>
  <li><strong>Kirkstone</strong> – The codename for Yocto 4.0, a long-term support (LTS) release</li>
  <li><strong>Dunfell</strong> – The codename for Yocto 3.1, another LTS release</li>
  <li><strong>Layers</strong> – Modular additions to the base Yocto version that provide extra functionality</li>
  <li><strong>BitBake</strong> – The build tool used by Yocto to process recipes and generate images</li>
  <li><strong>OpenEmbedded (OE)</strong> – The build framework Yocto is based on</li>
  <li><strong>Recipes</strong> (.bb files) – Build instructions for individual packages or applications</li>
  <li><strong>BSP</strong> (Board Support Package) – A set of metadata and configurations for specific hardware platforms</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="building-a-disk-image-with-yocto">Building a disk image with Yocto</h2>

<p>Before we build, you will need a pretty beefy server to build this image (or a lot of time). I’m using my <a href="https://vpetersson.com/2024/05/04/home-server-journey.html">home server</a>, and I think it took about an hour or two to build the initial version. Subsequent builds will be a lot faster due to cache.</p>

<p>I’ve used an Ubuntu 24.04 VM to build my disk images, and you can find the base dependencies you need to install <a href="https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/system-requirements.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="lets-get-our-hands-dirty">Let’s get our hands dirty</h3>

<p>First, clone the repositories and set up the layers:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git clone <span>-b</span> scarthgap https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
<span>$ </span><span>cd </span>poky
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code><span># Add layers</span>
<span>$ </span>git clone <span>-b</span> scarthgap git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-arm
<span>$ </span>git clone <span>-b</span> scarthgap git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-rockchip
<span>$ </span>git clone <span>-b</span> scarthgap git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
<span>$ </span>git clone <span>-b</span> scarthgap git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-virtualization
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>source </span>oe-init-build-env
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-arm/meta-arm-toolchain
<span>$ </span>bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-arm/meta-arm
<span>$ </span>bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-rockchip
<span>$ </span>bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-oe

<span># Add docker support</span>
<span>$ </span>bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-python
<span>$ </span>bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-networking
<span>$ </span>bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-filesystems
<span>$ </span>bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-virtualization
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, adjust your <code>conf/local.conf</code> by appending these configurations:</p>

<div><pre><code>MACHINE <span>=</span> <span>"rock-pi-4b"</span>

INIT_MANAGER <span>=</span> <span>"systemd"</span>
DISTRO_FEATURES:append <span>=</span> <span>" virtualization wifi"</span>
DISTRO_FEATURES:remove <span>=</span> <span>" x11 wayland"</span>
CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL +<span>=</span> <span>"openssh cups cups-filters ghostscript qpdf vim docker e2fsprogs-resize2fs"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally, build the image:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>bitbake core-image-base
</code></pre></div>

<p>Note, if you’re building on Ubuntu 24.04, you might need to run:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apparmor_parser <span>-R</span> /etc/apparmor.d/unprivileged_userns
</code></pre></div>

<p>After the build completes, you can find your image here:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>-lah</span> tmp/deploy/images/rock-pi-4b/core-image-base-rock-pi-4b.rootfs-<span>*</span>.wic
</code></pre></div>

<p>Flash this disk image and you should be good to go. Once it’s up and running, you should be able to SSH into the device using <code>root</code> and a blank password.</p>

<h2 id="on-updating">On updating</h2>

<p>It’s important to note that Yocto generates a disk image. By default, you cannot update this disk image by any other means than reflashing it (e.g., you can’t run “apt update”). There are over-the-air (OTA) platforms that can be integrated into Yocto, such as <a href="https://mender.io/">Mender</a> and <a href="https://rauc.io/">RAUC</a>, but by default, you need to rebuild the image from scratch to update dependencies and patch vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2 id="finding-your-sboms">Finding Your SBOMs</h2>

<p>One of the cool features of Yocto is that it automatically generates SBOMs. You can find them in the deploy directory:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>-lah</span> tmp/deploy/images/rock-pi-4b/<span>*</span>spdx<span>*</span>
<span>[</span>..]
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can extract the SPDX file with:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>--zstd</span> <span>-xvf</span> <span>\</span>
    path/to/tmp/deploy/images/rock-pi-4b/core-image-base-rock-pi-4b.rootfs-<span>*</span>.spdx.tar.zst
</code></pre></div>

<p>Do note that this will generate a lot of files. You will find a file called <code>index.json</code> in there, which links to all other SBOMs using document linking.</p>

<p>(Check out my article <a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/02/21/mastering-sbom-generation-with-yocto/">Mastering SBOM Generation with Yocto</a> for more details on the SBOMs.)</p>

<h2 id="on-running-in-production">On running in production</h2>

<p>If you are intending to run this in production, please do not just copy the above. These images are configured for lab or test mode. Yocto is very well suited for production images, but you need to harden them and also have an OTA strategy in place. Alternatively, I can recommend <a href="https://www.balena.io/">Balena</a>, which uses Yocto under the hood and also supports the Rock Pi.</p>

<h2 id="future-improvements">Future improvements</h2>

<p>One limitation of the current disk image for Rock Pi is that you don’t have a functional TTY. You can SSH in, or you could use a serial console, but the regular TTY doesn’t work and I haven’t spent much time trying to figure out why. Also, the disk system doesn’t automatically expand to use all available space on the eMMC/SD.</p>

<p>Some things I’m planning to add in the future:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add support for Tailscale (there’s a <a href="https://github.com/ChristophHandschuh/meta-tailscale">meta-tailscale</a> layer)</li>
