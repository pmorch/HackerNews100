							<p>It was dinnertime on October 30, 2024, when police handcuffed Brittany Patterson in front of three of her four children and drove her to the station in Fannin County, Georgia. She was then fingerprinted, photographed, and dressed in an orange jumpsuit.</p> <p>Hours earlier, around noon, Patterson had driven her eldest son to a medical appointment. Her youngest son, 11-year-old Soren, intended to come along but wasn't around when it was time to leave.</p> <p>"I figured he was in the woods, or at grandma's house," says Patterson, who lives on 16 acres with her kids and her father. (Her husband works out of state). There is no shortage of family in the vicinity. Patterson's mother and sisters live just two minutes away.</p> <p>Soren, however, was not playing in the woods. He had decided to walk to downtown Mineral Bluff, a town of just 370 people. It's not quite a mile from his house. A woman who saw him walking alongside the road—speed limit: 25 in some places, 35 in others—asked him if he was OK. He said yes.</p> <p>Nevertheless, she called the police.</p> <p>A female sheriff picked up the boy and called Patterson. "She asked me if I knew he was downtown and I said no," says Patterson.</p> <p>Patterson was upset that Soren had gone to town without letting anyone know, but says there was hardly reason to worry.</p> <p>"I was not panicking as I know the roads and know he is mature enough to walk there without incident," she says.</p> <p>The sheriff disagreed.</p> <p>"She kept mentioning how he could have been run over, or kidnapped or 'anything' could have happened," recalls Patterson.</p> <p>The sheriff drove Soren home and left him with his grandfather. After returning to the house, Patterson scolded her son—and that, she thought, was that.</p> <p>But at 6:30 p.m. that night, the sheriff returned with another officer. They told Patterson to turn around and put her hands behind her back. As three of her kids watched, Patterson was handcuffed. The sheriff took her purse and phone, put her in the cruiser, and hauled her off to jail.</p> <p>To Patterson, none of this made sense. She had grown up in the area with plenty of unsupervised time to wander and play and was raising her kids that way, too.</p> <p>"The mentality here is more Free-Range," she says.</p> <p>Patterson was soon released on a $500 bail. The next day, a case manager from the Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) came out for a home visit, and even went to interview Patterson's oldest son at his school. The case manager told Patterson that everything seemed fine, but declined to comment to&nbsp;<em>Reason.</em></p> <p>A few days later, DFCS presented Patterson with a "safety plan" for her to sign. It would require her to delegate a "safety person" to be a "knowing participant and guardian" and watch over the children whenever she leaves home. The plan would also require Patterson to download an app onto her son's phone allowing for his location to be monitored. (The day when it will be illegal <em>not </em>to track one's kids is rapidly approaching.)</p> <p>Patterson did not want to be compelled to track her son.

He recorded the conversation, which is legal in Georgia. The ADA told DeLugas that if Patterson would sign the safety plan, the criminal charges would be dropped.</p> <p>DeLugas responded that if Patterson had to sign a safety plan simply because her son walked someplace without her knowing his exact location, it would stop him from visiting friends or having any independence whatsoever. But the ADA maintained that Soren had been in danger, and thus a safety plan was necessary.</p> <p>The matter was left unsettled.</p> <p>With safety plans, the veiled threat is that if you don't sign, your children could be taken away, says DeLugas. In this case, he says, the unspoken deal seems to be: Sign it and the state won't prosecute. If the state&nbsp;<em>does&nbsp;</em>prosecute, Patterson could face a reckless conduct charge, a $1,000 fine, and a year in jail.</p> <p>DeLugas would like to see Georgia pass a law that permits the authorities to check up on kids and then leave them be as long as they aren't hurt, in distress, or in actual, immediate danger from an identifiable source. Meanwhile, as if this case could not get weirder, DCFS just mailed Soren a birthday card signed by the case manager. Soren turned 11 over the weekend.</p> <p>Birthday greetings do not change the facts. Patterson knows that refusing to sign the safety plan could get her in trouble. But she is resolute.</p> <p>"I will not sign," she says.</p>						</div></div>]]></description>

<p>Anyone who uses Twitter a lot knows that it's a big place. Not just that it has a lot of active users, but more that there are lots of different parts.</p>
<p>Over time, everybody develops their own mental map of the landscape, infering how vast and foreign the whole network is from hints and clues, stray tweets escaping containment, and chance encounters in a big account's replies. But we never get to see the whole thing for real.</p>
<p>We can't make a map of all of Twitter, because the data isn't available and scraping it would be difficult and illegal. But we can do it for <a href="https://bsky.app/">BlueSky</a>, which has seen massive growth over the last several months thanks to Twitter's ongoing antagonization of its userbase and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_of_Twitter_in_Brazil">Brazil banning Twitter</a> outright in October 2024.</p>
<p>Here's a sneak peek at the final result.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>You can also explore the map interactively at <a href="https://aurora.ndimensional.xyz/">https://aurora.ndimensional.xyz</a>, although you'll need desktop Chrome/Chromium since it uses WebGPU.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first step is getting the data. To keep things manageable, I'm just working with the <em>follow graph</em>. In this graph, each follow is treated like a single undirected edge, so "mutuals" have two edges between them that essentially weight the edge double.</p>
<p>BlueSky is build on the <a href="https://atproto.com/">AT protocol</a>, designed to realistically support anyone who wants to self-host their own data on their own PDS (<em>personal data server</em>). But all we really care about for this project is the WebSocket firehose exposed by the "relay" service <code>bsky.network</code> that the BlueSky team runs, which aggregates all the events from the main <code>*.bksy.social</code> PDS, and also every independent PDS who asks to be indexed. We can just open a WebSocket at <code>wss://bsky.network/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.subscribeRepos</code> and see every type of event streaming in from the entire network in real time, currently around 500 events per second. We filter this down to follows and unfollows, and store it all in a local SQLite database.</p>

<p>At first, last year, I set up a fancy system where I deployed the indexer to <a href="https://fly.io/">fly.io</a>, and configured it to replicate the database in realtime to an AWS S3 bucket using litestream. But that was a little over-engineered, and surprisingly expensive to run (my Fly bill was $40/month), so I shut it down and switched to running it entirely on my home server. I installed the indexer as a systemd service, and configured logrotate and a tmux&nbsp;monitor to let me ssh in through TailScale and watch the event stream live from anywhere.</p>

<p>Everything described in this entire post happens on this System76 desktop in my apartment.</p>
<p>How much data is there? BlueSky is growing quickly, but at the time of writing, it recently passed 13 million users, and the <code>follows</code> table had a little over half a billion rows, which was only around 30 GB on disk.</p>

<p>How do you render a graph of 13 million nodes and half a billion edges?</p>
<p>Graph layout has an entire field of research behind it. Some algorithms are designed for visually appealing diagrams, like <a href="https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre/wiki">dagre</a> or the <a href="https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline">ones that GraphViz uses</a>. But of course the "classical" way to do this is with a force-directed layout. I remember seeing them first in the <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-graph/2">D3 examples</a>.</p>
<p>
  <img srcset="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/d3-gallery.gif 2x" width="470" src="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/d3-gallery.gif" node="[object Object]">
</p>
<p>Force-directed graph layout is essentially a physics simulation: you pretend that every node exterts a repulsive force on every other node, and that edges induce an attractive force between the source and target. Typically, the repulsive force decreases quadratically with distance, like a magnet, and the attractive force increases linearly with distance, like a spring. On every "tick" of the simulation, you compute the net force on every node, and then move each node by its net force vector scaled by some global "temperature" parameter.</p>
<hr>
<p>Computing these ticks is slow. The issue isn't the literal size of the graph - 500 million edges can easily fit in memory if they're just <code>[f32, f32]</code> tuples - but the computational complexity of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation">n-body problem</a>.</p>
<p>The core issue is that since every node repells every other node, the naive algorithm for a single simulation tick is <code>O(n^2) + O(e)</code> (for <code>n</code> nodes and <code>e</code> edges). This is a non-starter for graphs with millions of nodes, even for a GPU. Instead, every force-directed graph engine uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation">Barnes-Hut</a> optimization, which reduces this to <code>O(n log(n)) + O(e)</code> at the expense of approximating the effects of distant nodes.</p>
<p>
  <img srcset="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/Spatial_quadtree_structure_of_the_Barnes-Hut_algorithm_in_the_N-body_problem.gif 2x" width="500" src="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/Spatial_quadtree_structure_of_the_Barnes-Hut_algorithm_in_the_N-body_problem.gif" node="[object Object]">
</p>
<p>Building and querying the quadtree is intrinsically heirarchical, which means the node forces can't easily be computed on the GPU. Still, we can parallelize things as much as possible. The quadtree can be split up into 4 or 16 quadtrees, each rebuilt in parallel at the beginning of each tick. And then computing the forces can be parallelized arbitrarily by giving each thread in the pool a range of nodes to process. Each node's net force is the sum of the forces exerted on it by each of the quadtrees (computing this for a given node is just <code>O(log(n))</code>), and the forces exterted on it by all of its incoming and outgoing edges. We can utilize all available CPU with essentially zero overhead.</p>
<hr>
<p>I made a little multithreaded engine for force-directed graph layout in Zig, made a GUI using GTK4 and OpenGL, and named it <a href="https://github.com/nDimensional/andromeda">Andromeda</a>.</p>
<p>
  <img srcset="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/graph-1e6.png 2x" width="1530" src="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/graph-1e6.png" node="[object Object]">
</p>
<p>Andromeda is largely inspired by Gephi and the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098679">ForceAtlas2 paper</a>. The authors are keen to emphasize the importance of interactivity for working with large scale graph visualization - you need to be able to watch the graph evolving, and dynamically adjust the simulation parameters. You just don't get good results if your tools are opaque and have long iteration times.</p>
<p>Here's Andromeda running in real-time on a graph of 100,000 nodes.</p>

<hr>
<p>One of Andromeda's cute features is a UI widget that I call a "natural slider". Often when opening a new graph, or testing a new version of the engine, or adding a new parameter, it's impossible to know ahead of time what a sensible range for the value should be, even to an order of magnitude. Not to worry! With the natural slider, you can dynamically adjust the range by powers of e.</p>
<p>
  <img srcset="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/natural-slider.gif 2x" width="285" type="image/gif" src="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/natural-slider.gif" node="[object Object]">
</p>
<p>This gives us "natural orders" that fit our intuitive sense of "bigger" and "smaller" while giving easy access to the entire range of positive floats. Powers of 2 are too small, powers of ten are too big.</p>
<hr>
<p>Unfortunately, force-directed layouts for large social networks leave some things to be desired. Here's Andromeda's ForceAtlas2 layout of a snapshot of 5 million BlueSky users from September 2024:</p>

<p>The result is very "blobby". It clearly shows the mass and density of the major clusters - the "large-scale structure" - but most nodes are just strewn across vast undifferentiated fields in the general orbit of a supercluster. Only a couple dozen small communities, mostly countries, are tight and isolated enough to break off into their own streak.</p>
<p>I published an early version of this back in February, when the graph had just 2 million accounts. A common response was fascination with the global view but disappointment with the local views. The website lets people locate accounts by username, and when people looked themselves up, they didn't recognize the accounts around them, and had to search far and wide for familiar faces.</p>
<p>
  <img srcset="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/early-aurora.jpg 2x" src="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/early-aurora.jpg" node="[object Object]">
</p>
<p>There's naturally going to be pretty severe limitations on what is even possible here. No arrangement of accounts on a 2d plane will feel like it really captures the full topology of how the network is connected. But it felt like it was possible to do better, and that the force-directed approach just wasn't sensitive to local neighborhoods.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another way of seeing graph layout is as a type of "dimensionality reduction". We're try to take a big 13 million x 13 million adjacency matrix and project it onto a 2-dimensional pane. Naturally, dimensionality reduction has already been a point of interest in the machine learning world, first through linear algebra techniques like PCA and spectral analysis, and more recently through a variety of non-linear techniques. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_dimensionality_reduction">This Wikipedia page</a> has a great survey of them.</p>
<p>The big two that are famous for being shockingly good for 2-dimensional visualizations are t-SNE and UMAP. UMAP is behind several popular visualizations you may have seen on Hacker News or Twitter, like <a href="https://johnhw.github.io/umap_primes/index.md.html">this one</a> of the prime divisors of first million integers.</p>
<p>
  <img srcset="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/primes_umap_1e6_contrast_enhanced.jpg 2x" src="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/primes_umap_1e6_contrast_enhanced.jpg" node="[object Object]">
</p>
<p>What happens if we throw the BlueSky matrix into UMAP? Well, we can't, at least not directly. Even though UMAP technically accepts sparse matrices, our scale is just to big for my home server. Instead, we can settle for using some other technique to derive embeddings for every user, in a medium-sized dimension like 32, and then feed <em>that</em> into UMAP. Easy!</p>
<p>After a bit of research it looked like this <a href="https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors/">nodevectors</a> repo was the best open-source node embedding toolkit, and the as-of-yet-unpublished GGVec algorithm had the best parallelized performance on huge graphs. I got embeddings for a 5-million-node September snapshot in just 5 minutes, and my first UMAP picture in another 10 minutes.</p>

</p>
<p>Amazing! Much more intermediate structure than the blobs that Andromeda gave us. Checking on my immediate neighbors, it felt better, although not as good as I had hoped. I wasn't in the immediate vicinity of <em>any</em> of my mutuals, even though the neighborhood felt closer to my "type" of account. Like people from another city in my state, but not my neighbors.</p>
<p>Is it really that hard? Is the graph topology connected in a way that only a tiny fraction of accounts can be placed near their mutuals? Or is all the local detail lost in the embedding, before UMAP? I'm still not sure.</p>
<hr>
<p>UMAP is really good, but has a couple quirks that aren't ideal for this project. One is that even if you spend days on end fiddling with the parameters, it's impossible to stop UMAP from making some clusters so dense that the points overlap. This behavior is expected and desirable if you want a pure dimensionality reduction where identical points in the source dimension map to the exact same place in the target dimension. But for making a map, I planned on rendering each account's profile picture on their node at close zoom levels, and wanted everyone to have the experience of seeing themselves placed in the big map.</p>
<p>Internally, UMAP actually uses a force-directed graph of its own in its final stage. At a very high level, UMAP works by taking the source embeddings and</p>
<ol>
<li>computing a "k-nearest-neighbors graph" where every sample has an edge to each of its <code>k</code> closest neighbors by euclidean distance in the embedding dimension</li>
<li>using fancy math to find special weights for these edges</li>
<li>computing a force-directed layout for the weighed k-nearest-neighbors graph</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the magic that makes UMAP look good is inside step 2, but computationally it still follows the same outline - nodes repel, edges attract. But UMAP plays it somewhat fast-and-loose with the final step, due to "computational constraints", and uses <em>sampling</em> to doing the force-directed layout. This means not every node actually repels every other node, even in the approximate way that Barnes-Hut does. Only some are randomly selected to interact with each other. So even though the <code>min_dist</code> parameter is supposed to control separation between points, I found it doesn't work very consistently for huge graphs.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I had already developed Andromeda to a point where it was easy to tweak the repulsive force equation, plug the UMAP output in, and run the simulation for a few ticks to "smooth out" the overlapping points.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Now, even in the most dense clusters, nodes are packed perfectly without layering.</p>
<p>
  <img srcset="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/Screenshot 2024-11-10 at 2.59.06 https://joelgustafson.com/posts/2024-11-12/PM.jpg 2x" src="https://assets.joelgustafson.com/2024-11-12/Screenshot%202024-11-10%20at%202.59.06%20PM.jpg" node="[object Object]">
</p>
<p>Ideally I would love to get access to the raw weights of the graph that UMAP constructs, and use them in Andromeda directly, with the force equations from the UMAP paper but using Andromeda's parallelized quadtree, and see if the layout looks any different. I'll try to do this for the next version.</p>
<hr>
<p>Can we add color to this?</p>
<p>One approach is to apply clustering algorithms like HDBScan directly to the UMAP output, and color the clusters...</p>

</p>
<p>... but color also represents an opportunity to add another dimension of information, however small. UMAP is forced to superimpose separate clusters at times, so coloring nodes with a hue derived independently from the embedding space could help visually disambiguate them. The UMAP documentation has an <a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plotting.html#diagnostic-plotting">example</a> of doing PCA on the embedding space, and using the first three components for RGB values to color points for plotting. This is good for diagnostics, but isn't particularly visually appealing.</p>
<p>After a few rounds of design iteration, I settled on a process that computes a k-means clustering in the embedding space, assigns hues to each cluster, and then interpolates hues for points using their three nearest cluster centers. I found that this highlights more local struture than PCA, smoothly transitions in the embedding dimension, and gives the map a soothing, dappled, stained-glass texture up-close.</p>

<p>These hues are just single floats from 0 to 1, which I map to rgb using the hsluv color space. Saturation for every node is constant, to give the visualization some consistent visual identity. And lightness is scaled using the log10 of each user's follower count, so that large accounts appear as bright stars and lowbies appear muted. I had originally tried to render large accounts literally larger, but that turned out way too visually cluttered for large graphs.</p>
<p>Here's the full network as of 2024-11-07. I filtered out accounts that follow more than 50k accounts, or follow less than 5 accounts and have less than 5 followers, leaving 7.7 million nodes.</p>

<p>Neat!</p>
<p>There's a lot to learn from exploring the graph. Bot rings show up clearly exposed, for one. It creates a new kind of tourism, for better or worse, although not everyone in every community may be all that enthusiastic about this.</p>
<p>The next feature I'd like to add is a collapsible sidebar with a timeline of posts from just the accounts currently in view, so that you can easily check in on what the area you're looking at has been talking about. If you have other ideas let me know on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/syntacrobat.xyz">BlueSky</a> or <a href="https://x.com/gustafjt/">Twitter</a>; I'd love for this to be the beginning of a new kind of social/memetic exploration tool.</p>

<p>Roll out the red carpet. Starting today, anyone in Los Angeles can take fully autonomous rides 24/7 with Waymo One – rolling through Santa Monica, Hollywood Boulevard, USC, and everything in between.</p>
<p>Waymo has enjoyed a warm welcome from Angelenos since we began commercial operations in LA earlier this year, with nearly 300,000 people joining our waitlist. We’ve opened our doors to those eager riders over time, who have taken hundreds of thousands of paid trips across the city and highly rated them at 4.7 / 5 stars on average. In fact, riders recently surveyed in LA said that 98% are satisfied with our service and 96% find it useful.</p>
<p>“Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,” said Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO, Waymo. “Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We’re so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can’t wait to serve more riders soon.”</p>
<p>Riders can now traverse nearly 80 sq miles of LA County, and we intend to grow our service area to cover more of the city in the future. We look forward to welcoming many first-time riders and welcoming back those we’ve served over the last year, as we steadily scale our service over time just as we’ve done in San Francisco and Phoenix.</p>
<p><b>A service for everyone</b></p>
<p>Our LA riders have fully embraced the convenience and freedom of riding with Waymo One. With the Waymo Driver at the wheel, people are reclaiming their time in LA traffic to be more productive – or not – as they wish. Whether it’s taking extra time to run lines before an audition, filming social media videos, or simply taking a beat to relax, Angelenos are increasingly incorporating Waymo into their daily lives.</p>
<p>As we open our doors to more people, we’re working closely with local community partners aligned with our mission to make roads safer and mobility more accessible. For example, we’re proud to work with She is Hope, a nonprofit dedicated to empowering single mothers in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>“Riding with Waymo was an incredible experience—smooth, safe, and truly impressive,” said Tisha Janigan, founder of She is Hope. “When I rode alone and with some of our single mother families, we were amazed by the driverless technology and the sense of comfort it provided. Access to Waymo could be a game-changer for women we serve, offering a nonjudgmental, reliable transportation option that prioritizes safety.”</p>
<figure><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SAg9jI9EnvM" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen="" height="400" width="400"></iframe></figure>
<p>Waymo’s also proud to serve as the Official Ride-Hail Partner of the <a href="https://laautoshow.com/">Los Angeles Auto Show</a>. If you’ll be in town and attending the show running November 22 - December 1, join us to learn more.</p>
<p>We’re eager for more people to experience the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. To ride in LA, SF, or Phoenix, simply download the <a href="https://waymo.com/waymo-one/">Waymo One</a> app and ride today.</p>

<p>During my first semester as a computer science graduate student at Princeton, I took <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall08/cos402/schedule.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">COS 402: Artificial Intelligence</a>. Toward the end of the semester, there was a lecture about neural networks. This was in the fall of 2008, and I got the distinct impression—both from that lecture and the textbook—that neural networks had become a backwater.</p>
<p>Neural networks had delivered some impressive results in the late 1980s and early 1990s. But then progress stalled. By 2008, many researchers had moved on to mathematically elegant approaches such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">support vector machines</a>.</p>
<p>I didn’t know it at the time, but a team at Princeton—in the same computer science building where I was attending lectures—was working on a project that would upend the conventional wisdom and demonstrate the power of neural networks. That team, led by Prof. Fei-Fei Li, wasn’t working on a better version of neural networks. They were hardly thinking about neural networks at all.</p>
<p>Rather, they were creating a new image dataset that would be far larger than any that had come before: 14 million images, each labeled with one of nearly 22,000 categories.</p>
<p>Li tells the story of ImageNet in her recent memoir, <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250897930/theworldsisee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><em>The Worlds I See</em></a>. As she worked on the project, she faced plenty of skepticism from friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>“I think you’ve taken this idea way too far,” a mentor told her a few months into the project in 2007. “The trick is to grow with your field. Not to leap so far ahead of it.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just that building such a large dataset was a massive logistical challenge. People doubted that the machine learning algorithms of the day would benefit from such a vast collection of images.</p>
<p>“Pre-ImageNet, people did not believe in data,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgQ1FJ_wow8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Li said</a> in a September interview at the Computer History Museum. “Everyone was working on completely different paradigms in AI with a tiny bit of data.”</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Ignoring negative feedback, Li pursued the project for more than two years. It strained her research budget and the patience of her graduate students. When she took a new job at Stanford in 2009, she took several of those students—and the ImageNet project—with her to California.</p>
<p>ImageNet received little attention for the first couple of years after its release in 2009. But in 2012, a team from the University of Toronto trained a neural network on the ImageNet dataset, achieving unprecedented performance in image recognition. That groundbreaking AI model, dubbed AlexNet after lead author Alex Krizhevsky, kicked off the deep learning boom that has continued to the present day.</p>
<p>AlexNet would not have succeeded without the ImageNet dataset. AlexNet also would not have been possible without a platform called CUDA, which allowed Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) to be used in non-graphics applications. Many people were skeptical when Nvidia announced CUDA in 2006.</p>
<p>So the AI boom of the last 12 years was made possible by three visionaries who pursued unorthodox ideas in the face of widespread criticism. One was Geoffrey Hinton, a University of Toronto computer scientist who spent decades promoting neural networks despite near-universal skepticism. The second was Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, who recognized early that GPUs could be useful for more than just graphics.</p>
<p>The third was Fei-Fei Li. She created an image dataset that seemed ludicrously large to most of her colleagues. But it turned out to be essential for demonstrating the potential of neural networks trained on GPUs.</p>

<h2>Geoffrey Hinton</h2>
<p>A neural network is a network of thousands, millions, or even billions of neurons. Each neuron is a mathematical function that produces an output based on a weighted average of its inputs.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to create a network that can identify handwritten decimal digits like the number two in the red square above. Such a network would take in an intensity value for each pixel in an image and output a probability distribution over the ten possible digits—0, 1, 2, and so forth.</p>
<p>To train such a network, you first initialize it with random weights. You then run it on a sequence of example images. For each image, you train the network by strengthening the connections that push the network toward the right answer (in this case, a high-probability value for the “2” output) and weakening connections that push toward a wrong answer (a low probability for “2” and high probabilities for other digits). If trained on enough example images, the model should start to predict a high probability for “2” when shown a two—and not otherwise.</p>
<p>In the late 1950s, scientists started to experiment with basic networks that had a single layer of neurons. However, their initial enthusiasm cooled as they realized that such simple networks lacked the expressive power required for complex computations.</p>
<p>Deeper networks—those with multiple layers—had the potential to be more versatile. But in the 1960s, no one knew how to train them efficiently. This was because changing a parameter somewhere in the middle of a multi-layer network could have complex and unpredictable effects on the output.</p>
<p>So by the time Hinton began his career in the 1970s, neural networks had fallen out of favor. Hinton wanted to study them, but he struggled to find an academic home in which to do so. Between 1976 and 1986, Hinton spent time at four different research institutions: Sussex University, the University of California San Diego (UCSD), a branch of the UK Medical Research Council, and finally Carnegie Mellon, where he became a professor in 1982.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/323533a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">landmark 1986 paper</a>, Hinton teamed up with two of his former colleagues at UCSD, David Rumelhart and Ronald Williams, to describe a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">backpropagation</a> for efficiently training deep neural networks.</p>
<p>Their idea was to start with the final layer of the network and work backward. For each connection in the final layer, the algorithm computes a gradient—a mathematical estimate of whether increasing the strength of that connection would push the network toward the right answer. Based on these gradients, the algorithm adjusts each parameter in the model’s final layer.</p>
<p>The algorithm then propagates these gradients backward to the second-to-last layer. A key innovation here is a formula—based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">chain rule</a> from high school calculus—for computing the gradients in one layer based on gradients in the following layer. Using these new gradients, the algorithm updates each parameter in the second-to-last layer of the model. The gradients then get propagated backward to the third-to-last layer, and the whole process repeats once again.</p>
<p>The algorithm only makes small changes to the model in each round of training. But as the process is repeated over thousands, millions, billions, or even trillions of training examples, the model gradually becomes more accurate.</p>
<p>Hinton and his colleagues weren’t the first to discover the basic idea of backpropagation. But their paper popularized the method. As people realized it was now possible to train deeper networks, it triggered a new wave of enthusiasm for neural networks.</p>

<p>Hinton moved to the University of Toronto in 1987 and began attracting young researchers who wanted to study neural networks. One of the first was the French computer scientist Yann LeCun, who did a year-long postdoc with Hinton before moving to Bell Labs in 1988.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Hinton’s backpropagation algorithm allowed LeCun to train models deep enough to perform well on real-world tasks like handwriting recognition. By the mid-1990s, LeCun’s technology was working so well that banks <a href="https://x.com/ylecun/status/1412545237659029507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">started to use it</a> for processing checks.</p>
<p>“At one point, LeCun’s creation read more than 10 percent of all checks deposited in the United States,” wrote Cade Metz in his 2022 book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/565698/genius-makers-by-cade-metz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><em>Genius Makers</em></a>.</p>
<p>But when LeCun and other researchers tried to apply neural networks to larger and more complex images, it didn’t go well. Neural networks once again fell out of fashion, and some researchers who had focused on neural networks moved on to other projects.</p>
<p>Hinton never stopped believing that neural networks could outperform other machine learning methods. But it would be many years before he’d have access to enough data and computing power to prove his case.</p>

<p>The brain of every personal computer is a central processing unit (CPU). These chips are designed to perform calculations in order, one step at a time. This works fine for conventional software like Windows and Office. But some video games require so many calculations that they strain the capabilities of CPUs. This is especially true of games like <em>Quake</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, and <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, which render three-dimensional worlds many times per second.</p>
<p>So gamers rely on GPUs to accelerate performance. Inside a GPU are many execution units—essentially tiny CPUs—packaged together on a single chip. During gameplay, different execution units draw different areas of the screen. This parallelism enables better image quality and higher frame rates than would be possible with a CPU alone.</p>
<p>Nvidia invented the GPU in 1999 and has dominated the market ever since. By the mid-2000s, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang suspected that the massive computing power inside a GPU would be useful for applications beyond gaming. He hoped scientists could use it for compute-intensive tasks like weather simulation or oil exploration.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>So in 2006, Nvidia announced the CUDA platform. CUDA allows programmers to write “kernels,” short programs designed to run on a single execution unit. Kernels allow a big computing task to be split up into bite-sized chunks that can be processed in parallel. This allows certain kinds of calculations to be completed far faster than with a CPU alone.</p>
<p>But there was little interest in CUDA when it was first introduced, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/12/04/how-jensen-huangs-nvidia-is-powering-the-ai-revolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">wrote Steven Witt</a> in The New Yorker last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>When CUDA was released, in late 2006, Wall Street reacted with dismay. Huang was bringing supercomputing to the masses, but the masses had shown no indication that they wanted such a thing.</p>
<p>“They were spending a fortune on this new chip architecture,” Ben Gilbert, the co-host of “Acquired,” a popular Silicon Valley podcast, said. “They were spending many billions targeting an obscure corner of academic and scientific computing, which was not a large market at the time—certainly less than the billions they were pouring in.”</p>
<p>Huang argued that the simple existence of CUDA would enlarge the supercomputing sector. This view was not widely held, and by the end of 2008, Nvidia’s stock price had declined by seventy percent…</p>
<p>Downloads of CUDA hit a peak in 2009, then declined for three years. Board members worried that Nvidia’s depressed stock price would make it a target for corporate raiders.</p></blockquote>
<p>Huang wasn’t specifically thinking about AI or neural networks when he created the CUDA platform. But it turned out that Hinton’s backpropagation algorithm could easily be split up into bite-sized chunks. So training neural networks turned out to be a killer app for CUDA.</p>
<p>According to Witt, Hinton was quick to recognize the potential of CUDA:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2009, Hinton’s research group used Nvidia’s CUDA platform to train a neural network to recognize human speech. He was surprised by the quality of the results, which he presented at a conference later that year. He then reached out to Nvidia. “I sent an e-mail saying, ‘Look, I just told a thousand machine-learning researchers they should go and buy Nvidia cards. Can you send me a free one?’ ” Hinton told me. “They said no.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the snub, Hinton and his graduate students, Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever, obtained a pair of <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-gtx-580.c270" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Nvidia GTX 580 GPUs</a> for the AlexNet project. Each GPU had 512 execution units, allowing Krizhevsky and Sutskever to train a neural network hundreds of times faster than would be possible with a CPU. This speed allowed them to train a larger model—and to train it on many more training images. And they would need all that extra computing power to tackle the massive ImageNet dataset.</p>

<p>Fei-Fei Li wasn’t thinking about either neural networks or GPUs as she began a new job as a computer science professor at Princeton in January of 2007. While earning her PhD at Caltech, she had built a dataset called Caltech 101 that had 9,000 images across 101 categories.</p>
<p>That experience had taught her that computer vision algorithms tended to perform better with larger and more diverse training datasets. Not only had Li found her own algorithms performed better when trained on Caltech 101, but other researchers also started training their models using Li’s dataset and comparing their performance to one another. This turned Caltech 101 into a benchmark for the field of computer vision.</p>
<p>So when she got to Princeton, Li decided to go much bigger. She became obsessed with an <a href="http://wexler.free.fr/library/files/biederman%20%281987%29%20recognition-by-components.%20a%20theory%20of%20human%20image%20understanding.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">estimate</a> by vision scientist Irving Biederman that the average person recognizes roughly 30,000 different kinds of objects. Li started to wonder if it would be possible to build a truly comprehensive image dataset—one that included every kind of object people commonly encounter in the physical world.</p>
<p>A Princeton colleague told Li about WordNet, a massive database that attempted to catalog and organize 140,000 words. Li called her new dataset ImageNet, and she used WordNet as a starting point for choosing categories. She eliminated verbs and adjectives, as well as intangible nouns like “truth.” That left a list of 22,000 countable objects ranging from “ambulance” to “zucchini.”</p>
<p>She planned to take the same approach she’d taken with the Caltech 101 dataset: use Google’s image search to find candidate images, then have a human being verify them. For the Caltech 101 dataset, Li had done this herself over the course of a few months. This time she would need more help. She planned to hire dozens of Princeton undergraduates to help her choose and label images.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But even after heavily optimizing the labeling process—for example, pre-downloading candidate images so they’re instantly available for students to review—Li and her graduate student Jia Deng calculated that it would take more than 18 years to select and label millions of images.</p>
<p>The project was saved when Li learned about Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing platform Amazon had launched a couple of years earlier. Not only was AMT’s international workforce more affordable than Princeton undergraduates, but the platform was also far more flexible and scalable. Li’s team could hire as many people as they needed, on demand, and pay them only as long as they had work available.</p>
<p>AMT cut the time needed to complete ImageNet down from 18 to two years. Li writes that her lab spent two years “on the knife-edge of our finances” as the team struggled to complete the ImageNet project. But they had enough funds to pay three people to look at each of the 14 million images in the final data set.</p>
<p>ImageNet was ready for publication in 2009, and Li submitted it to the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, which was held in Miami that year. Their paper was accepted, but it didn’t get the kind of recognition Li hoped for.</p>
<p>“ImageNet was relegated to a poster session,” Li writes. “This meant that we wouldn’t be presenting our work in a lecture hall to an audience at a predetermined time but would instead be given space on the conference floor to prop up a large-format print summarizing the project in hopes that passersby might stop and ask questions… After so many years of effort, this just felt anticlimactic.”</p>
<p>To generate public interest, Li turned ImageNet into a competition. Realizing that the full dataset might be too unwieldy to distribute to dozens of contestants, she created a much smaller (but still massive) dataset with 1,000 categories and 1.4 million images.</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>The first year’s competition in 2010 generated a healthy amount of interest, with 11 teams participating. The winning entry was based on support vector machines. Unfortunately, Li writes, it was “only a slight improvement over cutting-edge work found elsewhere in our field.”</p>
<p>The second year of the ImageNet competition attracted fewer entries than the first. The winning entry in 2011 was another support vector machine, and it just barely improved on the performance of the 2010 winner. Li started to wonder if the critics had been right. Maybe “ImageNet was too much for most algorithms to handle.”</p>
<p>“For two years running, well-worn algorithms had exhibited only incremental gains in capabilities, while true progress seemed all but absent,” Li writes. “If ImageNet was a bet, it was time to start wondering if we’d lost.”</p>
<p>But when Li reluctantly staged the competition a third time in 2012, the results were totally different. Geoff Hinton’s team was the first to submit a model based on a deep neural network. And its top-5 accuracy was 85 percent—10 percentage points better than the 2011 winner.</p>
<p>Li’s initial reaction was incredulity: “Most of us saw the neural network as a dusty artifact encased in glass and protected by velvet ropes.”</p>

<p>The ImageNet winners were scheduled to be announced at the European Conference on Computer Vision in Florence, Italy. Li, who had a baby at home in California, was planning to skip the event. But when she saw how well AlexNet had done on her dataset, she realized this moment would be too important to miss: “I settled reluctantly on a twenty-hour slog of sleep deprivation and cramped elbow room.”</p>
<p>On an October day in Florence, Alex Krizhevsky presented his results to a standing-room-only crowd of computer vision researchers. Fei-Fei Li was in the audience. So was Yann LeCun.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Cade Metz reports that after the presentation, LeCun stood up and called AlexNet “an unequivocal turning point in the history of computer vision. This is proof.”</p>
<p>The success of AlexNet vindicated Hinton’s faith in neural networks, but it was arguably an even bigger vindication for LeCun.</p>
<p>AlexNet was a convolutional neural network, a type of neural network that LeCun had developed 20 years earlier to recognize handwritten digits on checks. (For more details on how CNNs work, see the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/12/how-computers-got-shockingly-good-at-recognizing-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">in-depth explainer</a> I wrote for Ars in 2018.) Indeed, there were few architectural differences between AlexNet and LeCun’s image recognition networks from the 1990s.</p>
<p>AlexNet was simply far larger. In a <a href="http://vision.stanford.edu/cs598_spring07/papers/Lecun98.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">1998 paper</a>, LeCun described a document-recognition network with seven layers and 60,000 trainable parameters. AlexNet had eight layers, but these layers had <em>60 million</em> trainable parameters.</p>
<p>LeCun could not have trained a model that large in the early 1990s because there were no computer chips with as much processing power as a 2012-era GPU. Even if LeCun had managed to build a big enough supercomputer, he would not have had enough images to train it properly. Collecting those images would have been hugely expensive in the years before Google and Amazon Mechanical Turk.</p>
<p>And this is why Fei-Fei Li’s work on ImageNet was so consequential. She didn’t invent convolutional networks or figure out how to make them run efficiently on GPUs. But she provided the training data that large neural networks needed to reach their full potential.</p>
<p>The technology world immediately recognized the importance of AlexNet. Hinton and his students formed a shell company with the goal to be “acquihired” by a big tech company. Within months, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/secret-auction-race-ai-supremacy-google-microsoft-baidu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Google purchased the company</a> for $44 million. Hinton worked at Google for the next decade while retaining his academic post in Toronto. Ilya Sutskever spent a few years at Google before becoming a cofounder of OpenAI.</p>

<p>AlexNet also made Nvidia GPUs the industry standard for training neural networks. In 2012, the market valued Nvidia at less than $10 billion. Today, Nvidia is one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalization north of $3 trillion. That high valuation is driven mainly by overwhelming demand for GPUs like the H100 that are optimized for training neural networks.</p>
<h2>Sometimes the conventional wisdom is wrong</h2>
<p>“That moment was pretty symbolic to the world of AI because three fundamental elements of modern AI converged for the first time,” <a href="https://youtu.be/JgQ1FJ_wow8?si=DzSpFUhLsPyRt7Nu&amp;t=811" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Li said</a> in a September interview at the Computer History Museum. “The first element was neural networks. The second element was big data, using ImageNet. And the third element was GPU computing.”</p>
<p>Today, leading AI labs believe the key to progress in AI is to train huge models on vast data sets. Big technology companies are in such a hurry to build the data centers required to train larger models that they’ve started to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/nx-s1-5120581/three-mile-island-nuclear-power-plant-microsoft-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">lease out entire nuclear power plants</a> to provide the necessary power.</p>
<p>You can view this as a straightforward application of the lessons of AlexNet. But I wonder if we ought to draw the opposite lesson from AlexNet: that it’s a mistake to become too wedded to conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>“Scaling laws” have had a remarkable run in the 12 years since AlexNet, and perhaps we’ll see another generation or two of impressive results as the leading labs scale up their foundation models even more.</p>
<p>But we should be careful not to let the lessons of AlexNet harden into dogma. I think there’s at least a chance that scaling laws will run out of steam in the next few years. And if that happens, we’ll need a new generation of stubborn nonconformists to notice that the old approach isn’t working and try something different.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jepsen.io/analyses/bufstream-0.1.0">https://jepsen.io/analyses/bufstream-0.1.0</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42115611">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><a href="https://buf.build/product/bufstream">Bufstream</a> is a <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a>-compatible streaming system which stores records directly in an object storage service like S3. We found three safety and two liveness issues in Bufstream, including stuck consumers and producers, spurious zero offsets, and the loss of acknowledged writes in healthy clusters. These problems were resolved by version 0.1.3. We also characterize four issues related to Kafka more generally, including the lack of authoritative documentation for transaction semantics, a deadlock in the official Java client, and write loss, aborted read, and torn transactions caused by the lack of message ordering constraints in the Kafka transaction protocol. These issues affect Kafka, Bufstream, and (presumably) other Kafka-compatible systems, and remain unresolved. A companion <a href="https://buf.build/blog/bufstream-jepsen-report">blog post</a> from Buf is available as well. This report was funded by Buf Technologies, Inc.&nbsp;and conducted in accordance with the <a href="https://jepsen.io/analyses/ethics">Jepsen ethics policy</a>.</p><article>
  <div>
<h2 data-number="1" id="background"> Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> is a popular streaming system which provides replicated, sharded, append-only logs. <a href="https://buf.build/product/bufstream">Bufstream</a> is a drop-in replacement for Kafka designed to prioritize <a href="https://buf.build/blog/bufstream-kafka-lower-cost">data governance and cost efficiency</a> in cloud environments.</p>
<p>Like Kafka, Bufstream provides a collection of named, partially ordered logs called <em>topics</em>. Each topic is divided into <em>partitions</em>.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Each partition is a totally ordered, append-only list of <em>records</em> (also called <em>messages</em> or <em>events</em>). Within a partition, each record is uniquely identified by a monotonically advancing integer <em>offset</em>. Offsets may be sparse: some offsets are used for storing internal metadata and are invisible to clients.</p>
<p>Bufstream works with standard Kafka clients. There are two main types of clients in Kafka-compatible systems. <em>Producers</em> append records to partitions by calling <code>producer.send()</code>. <em>Consumers</em> read those records. Consumers are first bound to partitions via <code>consumer.assign()</code> or <code>consumer.subscribe()</code> operations.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Once bound, one repeatedly calls <code>consumer.poll()</code> to receive records from any of those partitions. Each consumer can belong to a <em>consumer group</em>, which shares responsibility for processing records from a set of topics.</p>
<p>Each partition has a <em>last stable offset (LSO)</em>, which is the highest offset below which every transaction has completed. It also has a <em>committed offset</em> for each consumer group, which is the highest offset below which that consumer group has processed all records in the partition.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>As in Kafka, records are opaque blobs of bytes by default. However, Bufstream can integrate with the <a href="https://buf.build/product/bsr">Buf Schema Registry</a> to introspect <a href="https://protobuf.dev/">Protocol Buffer</a> records. This allows Bufstream to <a href="https://buf.build/docs/bufstream/data-governance/schema-enforcement">validate records</a> before committing them, enforce field-level access control policies, and reformat data to interoperate with other systems. Unlike Kafka, which stores data on local disks and has its own <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/kafka/design/replication.html">replication protocol</a>, Bufstream <a href="https://buf.build/docs/bufstream/kafka-compatibility/configure-clients#optimizing-performance-and-write-throughput">writes its data directly to an object storage service</a>. By relying on object storage, which often bundles the cost of replication traffic, Bufstream aims to <a href="https://buf.build/docs/bufstream/cost">reduce costs</a>. This also allows Bufstream nodes to run as stateless, auto-scaled VMs.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Bufstream comprises three subsystems: an <em>agent</em>, an <em>object store</em>, and a <em>coordination service</em>. The agent is a stateless service which provides the Kafka API. Clients connect to agents to publish and consume records. The object store (e.g.&nbsp;S3) stores chunks of records as they are written, and makes them available to readers. The coordination service (presently <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a>) helps agents establish which chunks in storage are committed, and what the order of records should be.</p>
<p>As of October 2024, Bufstream was deployed only with select customers. Its documentation claimed to be “a drop-in replacement for Apache Kafka,” and listed compatibility with Kafka’s <a href="https://buf.build/docs/bufstream/kafka-compatibility/conformance">transactions and exactly-once semantics</a>. However, there were few specific safety claims beyond Kafka compatibility. Throughout this work we use Kafka’s documentation as our benchmark for evaluating Bufstream.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="client-safety"> Client Safety</h2>
<p>Like Kafka, Bufstream is intended for a variety of streaming applications with different throughput, latency, and safety tradeoffs. As in Jepsen’s <a href="https://jepsen.io/analyses/redpanda-21.10.1">previous work</a> on Kafka-compatible systems, we set a variety of client configuration options to obtain safer behavior.</p>
<p>We generally used the default <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/producer-configs.html#acks"><code>acks = all</code></a> for our producers. In Bufstream, <code>acks = 0</code> allows the server to acknowledge a write immediately without waiting for storage. As in Kafka, this may lose committed writes. Both <code>acks = 1</code> and <code>acks = all</code> block until Bufstream is certain the write is durably persisted.</p>
<p>Kafka producers can automatically retry writes. We used the default setting <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/producer-configs.html#enable-idempotence"><code>enable.idempotence = true</code></a> to prevent appending multiple copies of a record to the log.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.confluent.io/kafka/design/delivery-semantics.html#exactly-once-support">Confluent’s documentation</a> claims that “… by default Kafka guarantees at-least-once delivery.” This is untrue. By default, Kafka consumers may automatically mark offsets as committed, regardless of whether they have actually been processed by the application. This means that a consumer can poll a series of records, mark them as committed, then crash—effectively causing those records to be lost. We set <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/7.7/installation/configuration/consumer-configs.html#enable-auto-commit"><code>enable.auto.commit = false</code></a> to prevent this.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>When a consumer subscribes to a topic, it starts at the last committed offset. If no offset has been committed, it defaults to the most recent offset. This is another way in which Kafka’s defaults do not ensure at-least-once delivery. We used <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/clients/consumer.html#offset-management-configuration"><code>auto.offset.reset = earliest</code></a> to make sure consumers had a chance to observe the entire log.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="transactions"> Transactions</h2>
<p>Bufstream supports Kafka’s <a href="https://developer.confluent.io/courses/architecture/transactions/">transaction system</a>. Kafka transactions have <a href="https://jepsen.io/analyses/bufstream-0.1.0/kafka-transactions.jpg">complex semantics</a> determined by a wide array of configuration settings and the specific calls executed by producer and consumer. As we discussed <a href="https://jepsen.io/analyses/redpanda-21.10.1#discussion">two years ago</a>, Kafka’s <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/38/documentation.html">official documentation</a> largely omits any description of transaction invariants. Instead, documentation remains scattered across various <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/transactions-apache-kafka/">blog</a> <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/exactly-once-semantics-are-possible-heres-how-apache-kafka-does-it/">posts</a>, <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Transactional+Messaging+in+Kafka">Wiki pages</a>, <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-98+-+Exactly+Once+Delivery+and+Transactional+Messaging">Kafka Improvement Proposals</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Jqy_GjUGtdXJK94XGsEIK7CP1SnQGdp2eF0wSw9ra8/edit#heading=h.xq0ee1vnpz4o">Google Docs</a>, <a href="https://developer.confluent.io/learn/kafka-transactions-and-guarantees/">introductory guides</a>, and the Java client’s <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/0110/javadoc/index.html?org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/KafkaProducer.html">API documentation</a>. These resources are often confusing, underspecified, contradictory, or outright wrong. They generally focus on implementation mechanics rather than invariants. We have inferred Kafka’s intended transaction semantics as best we can from these documents and observed behavior.</p>
<p>In broad terms, a Kafka transaction comprises a set of records sent by a producer and a map of partitions to the maximum offsets polled by a consumer. Transactions provide a weak form of atomicity. If and only if the transaction commits, every sent record is durable and eventually visible to <code>read_committed</code> consumers in their respective partitions, and the committed offset for each partition is at least as high as the corresponding offset specified in the transaction. If the transaction does not commit, committed offsets do not advance, and some (or all) writes may (or may not) be visible depending on consumer configuration.</p>
<p>With the right implicit assumptions—for instance, that consumers process every record seen, that every record is processed in the scope of a transaction, that every transaction commits its highest consumed offsets, and so on—the committed offsets of a transaction can be understood as the set of records it consumed. With care, one can theoretically use transactions to obtain what Kafka terms “<a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/exactly-once-semantics-are-possible-heres-how-apache-kafka-does-it/">exactly-once semantics</a>.”</p>
<p>Consumers can run in one of two <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/consumer-configs.html?#isolation-level">isolation levels</a>: <code>read_uncommitted</code> or <code>read_committed</code>. At the default <code>read_uncommitted</code>, consumers may read values written by transactions which actually aborted. This is known as <em>aborted read (G1a)</em>. Transactions may observe none, part, or all of an aborted transaction’s writes. Two or more read-write transactions may also observe each other’s writes: a form of <em>circular information flow (G1c)</em>. Kafka’s documentation says that <code>read_committed</code> prevents G1a, and sort of<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> guarantees<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> that either all or none of a transaction’s writes are eventually visible. In our tests of Kafka, Redpanda, and Bufstream, <code>read_commmitted</code> also prevented G1c involving only write-read dependencies.</p>
<p>On the other hand, our tests of Kafka, Redpanda, and Bufstream all found write cycles <a href="https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/icde00.pdf">analogous to phenomenon G0</a> in normal operation. One transaction’s writes can appear in the middle of a second transaction’s writes. The major formalisms for Read Uncommitted generally prohibit G0, and the Kafka wiki <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Transactional+Messaging+in+Kafka">claims it should not occur</a> at <code>read_committed</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since X2 is committed first, each partition will expose messages from X2 before X1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, all three systems exhibited G0 both at <code>read_uncommitted</code> and <code>read_committed</code>. Either the documentation is wrong or Kafka’s transaction isolation is broken. We identified this problem in our 2022 Redpanda analysis, but it remains unaddressed.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Moreover, our tests show that Kafka, Redpanda, and Bufstream, even at <code>read_committed</code>, allow a different form of G1c proscribed by Read Committed. Specifically, they allow cycles of transactions linked by at least one write-write dependency. For instance, transaction <span><em>T</em><sub>1</sub></span> can write <span><em>a</em></span> to topic-partition <span><em>P</em></span> before <span><em>T</em><sub>2</sub></span> writes <span><em>b</em></span> to <span><em>P</em></span>. Then <span><em>T</em><sub>1</sub></span> can read <span><em>b</em></span>, forming a cycle. Kafka’s documentation still declines to state whether this should be legal.</p>
<p>Finally, a word about producer identifiers. Users can provide a <em>client ID</em>, which is helpful for logging but has no semantic effects. Producers also have an internal <a href="https://strimzi.io/blog/2023/05/03/kafka-transactions/"><em>producer ID</em></a>, which is used to de-duplicate sent records. Third, producers have a user-specified <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/transactions-apache-kafka/"><em>transactional ID</em></a>,<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> which identifies a logical producer across multiple client instances. When a logical producer crashes and restarts, it provides its transactional ID to the server, which increments an <em>epoch</em> associated with that ID. Transactional writes from older epochs are rejected.</p>
<h2 data-number="2" id="test-design"> Test Design</h2>
<p>We tested Bufstream 0.1.0 through 0.1.3, including several release candidate builds. We based <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/bufstream/tree/f1706313f171a69e9497743956aabcd131a5b248">our Bufstream test harness</a> on Jepsen’s previous work on <a href="https://jepsen.io/analyses/redpanda-21.10.1">Redpanda and Kafka</a>. We used the <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen">Jepsen testing library</a> and the <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-clients/java/current/overview.html">Java Kafka Client</a> at version 3.8.0. Since Bufstream implements the Kafka API, we were able to reuse much of the <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/redpanda">Redpanda/Kafka</a> test as a library.</p>
<p>We ran our tests on three to five Debian Bookworm nodes, both as LXC containers and EC2 VMs. We reserved one node for etcd, one for <a href="https://min.io/">Minio</a> (an S3-compatible object store), and the remainder for Bufstream agents. Producers, consumers, and admin clients were always initialized with a single node for <code>bootstrap_servers</code>, but we did not interfere with smart client discovery: clients could talk to any node freely. As with all smart clients, this may have reduced our chances to observe safety violations.</p>
<p>All consumers shared a <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/redpanda/blob/71becb5d5811396d81ef6dedd22f3e64ea2cdc80/src/jepsen/redpanda/client.clj#L114-L115">single consumer group</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/redpanda/blob/cf66299d62bb3595c69d558c930419475e7c672d/src/jepsen/redpanda/workload/queue.clj#L765-L768">committed their offsets manually</a> after each non-transactional poll operation. For transactional workloads we gave each producer a <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/redpanda/blob/cf66299d62bb3595c69d558c930419475e7c672d/src/jepsen/redpanda/workload/queue.clj#L669-L675">unique transactional ID</a> and used <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/redpanda/blob/cf66299d62bb3595c69d558c930419475e7c672d/src/jepsen/redpanda/workload/queue.clj#L339-L348"><code>sendOffsetsToTransaction</code></a> for any transaction which performed a poll—including read-only transactions.</p>
<p>We applied several configuration changes to clients in order to achieve faster recovery during failures, and to ensure safety. Our consumers ran with <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/redpanda/blob/cf66299d62bb3595c69d558c930419475e7c672d/src/jepsen/redpanda/client.clj#L83C45-L105C1">significantly shorter timeouts</a> (generally under 10 seconds), and with tunable <code>isolation_level</code>, <code>auto_offset_reset</code>, and <code>enable_auto_commit</code>. Producers also ran with <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/redpanda/blob/cf66299d62bb3595c69d558c930419475e7c672d/src/jepsen/redpanda/client.clj#L146-L159">shorter timeouts</a>, and configurable <code>acks</code>, <code>enable_idempotence</code>, and <code>retries</code>. In general we tested with the <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/bufstream/blob/f1706313f171a69e9497743956aabcd131a5b248/src/jepsen/bufstream/cli.clj#L327-L337">safest possible settings</a>: auto-commit false, acks <code>all</code>, retries 1,000, idempotence enabled, isolation level <code>read_committed</code>, <code>auto_offset_reset</code> of <code>earliest</code>, and automatic creation of topics on the server disabled. We tested both with and without transactions.</p>
<p>Like most Jepsen tests, we injected the usual suite of faults into Bufstream: process pauses (via <code>SIGSTOP</code>), crashes (via <code>SIGKILL</code>), clock skew (via <code>clock_settime</code>) and partitions (via <code>iptables</code>). Because Bufstream comprises three distinct subsystems, we designed new <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen/blob/ce07779ca3b81feb8553276581faa73d963a95b7/jepsen/src/jepsen/role.clj">subsystem-aware</a> DB automation, client, and fault injection tools for Jepsen. This allowed us to target faults to a particular subsystem, such as just crashing Bufstream nodes or pausing only the etcd coordinator. We mixed these faults together in shifting combinations <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/bufstream/blob/f1706313f171a69e9497743956aabcd131a5b248/src/jepsen/bufstream/nemesis.clj#L78-L103">over time</a>, producing, say, 30 seconds of partitions, 30 seconds of no faults, then Bufstream crashes with storage pauses, and so on.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="queue"> Queue</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://jepsen.io/analyses/redpanda-21.10.1">prior work on Redpanda and Kafka</a> we designed a <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/redpanda/blob/cf66299d62bb3595c69d558c930419475e7c672d/src/jepsen/redpanda/workload/queue.clj">queue workload</a> which performed sophisticated safety analysis geared towards Kafka’s data model. That workload is now <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen/blob/ce07779ca3b81feb8553276581faa73d963a95b7/jepsen/src/jepsen/tests/kafka.clj">part of the core Jepsen library</a>, and we updated it for use in Bufstream.</p>
<p>In this workload each logical process launched a producer, a consumer, and an admin client. For concision, we defined a logical numeric <em>key</em> which uniquely identified a specific topic-partition. Topics were created dynamically on first use. Keys were selected with exponential frequency: some keys accessed quite often, while others only infrequently. After sending a configurable number of records to a key, we abandoned it and moved on to a new one.</p>
<p>The queue workload performed three basic kinds of operations. <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/redpanda/blob/cf66299d62bb3595c69d558c930419475e7c672d/src/jepsen/redpanda/workload/queue.clj#L697">The first</a>, <code>crash</code>, simulated a client failure: it terminated the logical process, closing all three clients. Jepsen would then create a fresh process with new clients to take its place. The <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/redpanda/blob/cf66299d62bb3595c69d558c930419475e7c672d/src/jepsen/redpanda/workload/queue.clj#L689-L694">second class of operations</a>, <code>subscribe</code> or <code>assign</code>, updated the set of topics or partitions the consumer received records from when calling <code>poll</code>: either assigning a specific set of keys (topic-partitions), or subscribing to the set of topics which covered the requested keys.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/redpanda/blob/cf66299d62bb3595c69d558c930419475e7c672d/src/jepsen/redpanda/workload/queue.clj#L735-L779">third class</a> included <code>txn</code>, <code>poll</code>, and <code>send</code> operations. Each contained a sequence of <code>poll</code> or <code>send</code> micro-operations. Those which performed only polls or sends were labeled <code>poll</code> or <code>send</code>, rather than <code>txn</code>, but their structure was otherwise identical. Each <code>send</code> micro-operation sent a single <em>value</em> (a unique integer) to a specific key, and returned an <code>[offset, value]</code> pair, based on the offset Bufstream returned. Each <code>poll</code> micro-operation called <code>consumer.poll</code> once, and returned a map of keys to sequences of <code>[offset, value]</code> pairs observed for that key. For example:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1">[[<span>:poll</span> {<span>1</span> [[<span>2</span> <span>3</span>] [<span>4</span> <span>5</span>]]}]]</span>
<span id="cb1-2"> [<span>:send</span> <span>6</span> [<span>7</span> <span>8</span>]]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This transaction polled key <code>1</code> and received two records back: at offset <code>2</code>, value <code>3</code>; and at offset <code>4</code>, value <code>5</code>. Then it sent a single record <code>8</code> to key <code>6</code>, which was assigned offset <code>7</code>.</p>
<p>For non-transactional workloads we constrained every <code>send</code> or <code>poll</code> operation to contain exactly one micro-operation. For transactional workloads, we allowed multiple micro-operations and wrapped them all in a <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/redpanda/blob/cf66299d62bb3595c69d558c930419475e7c672d/src/jepsen/redpanda/workload/queue.clj#L434-L470">Kafka transaction</a>.</p>
<p>To analyze histories of these operations we first constructed, for each key, a mapping of offsets to sets of values observed at that offset, either via <code>send</code> or <code>poll</code>. If we observed multiple values at a single offset, we called it an <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen/blob/ce07779ca3b81feb8553276581faa73d963a95b7/jepsen/src/jepsen/tests/kafka.clj#L907-L998">inconsistent offset</a>. Since every value was unique within a key, we also expected to observe each value at most once. If we observed the same value at multiple offsets, we called that a <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen/blob/ce07779ca3b81feb8553276581faa73d963a95b7/jepsen/src/jepsen/tests/kafka.clj#L1454-L1479">duplicate error</a>.</p>
<p>If our mapping between a key’s values and offsets was bijective, we could construct a total order over values. This order might not cover all values: calls to <code>send</code> and <code>poll</code> might not have returned offsets. Nor could we necessarily tell which offset an indeterminate, unobserved <code>send</code> might have produced. Moreover, not every offset contained a value: like Kafka, Bufstream uses some log offsets to store transaction metadata. We therefore <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen/blob/ce07779ca3b81feb8553276581faa73d963a95b7/jepsen/src/jepsen/tests/kafka.clj#L993-L998">collapsed our sparse offset logs</a> into a dense version order which mapped each value to a unique <em>index</em> 0, 1, 2, ….</p>
<p>From this version order we looked for <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen/blob/ce07779ca3b81feb8553276581faa73d963a95b7/jepsen/src/jepsen/tests/kafka.clj#L2226-L2338">several additional errors</a>, which came in symmetric flavors. We checked subsequent pairs of send micro-operations, and subsequent pairs of polls as well, to see if the offsets for their values were strictly monotonic and did not skip over intermediate indices. We looked for non-monotonic or skipped offsets both within a single transaction and between successive transactions by the same process.</p>
<p>For aborted reads, we <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen/blob/ce07779ca3b81feb8553276581faa73d963a95b7/jepsen/src/jepsen/tests/kafka.clj#L1005-L1017">searched for any poll which returned a value sent by a failed operation</a>. We verified that transactions never observed their own writes, even if they later committed: we called this phenomenon <em>pre-committed read</em>.</p>
<p>When Bufstream confirmed receipt of a record but that record was never observed, we called that record <em>lost</em> or <em>unseen</em>. Lost records were those where some poller <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen/blob/ce07779ca3b81feb8553276581faa73d963a95b7/jepsen/src/jepsen/tests/kafka.clj#L1077-L1142">observed a higher offset</a>. Since consumers start at a known-consumed offset and proceed linearly, it should be impossible to poll index <span><em>n</em></span> unless some poller has already seen index <span><em>n</em> − 1</span>, and by induction, all lower indices.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Typically, a small tail of the log has just been written but has not yet been polled. After the main body of the test, we ceased transactions, resolved all faults, waited for recovery, then began a <em>final reads</em> phase. Each process assigned its consumer to every topic-partition, rewound to offset 0, and polled until it reached the highest offset known to have been written to that partition. If our final read phase timed out, leaving some acknowledged records unobserved, we called those records <em>unseen</em>.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="abort"> Abort</h2>
<p>Following unexpected results from the queue workload, we designed an <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/redpanda/blob/cf66299d62bb3595c69d558c930419475e7c672d/src/jepsen/redpanda/workload/abort.clj">abort workload</a> which aborted transactions and kept track of which offsets are polled. We limited each topic to a single partition, process, producer, and consumer. Each process would create a new topic, subscribe to it, then perform a series of transactions against that topic, each involving a single poll and a variable number of sends. Once one of those transactions had polled some records, the process shifted to intentionally aborting transactions. After some time, the process returned to committing transactions.</p>
<p>We examined the offsets returned by polls after an aborted transaction, and classified them into four categories. An <em>advance</em> meant that the next transaction began its polls at an offset higher than the last one polled in the previous, aborted transaction. A <em>rewind</em> meant that the next transaction started polling at the same offset the aborted transaction started at. A <em>rewind-further</em> meant that it started at some earlier offset. Any other behavior we called <em>other</em>.</p>
<h2 data-number="3" id="bufstream-results"> Bufstream Results</h2>
<p>We begin with five issues in Bufstream proper, from liveness failures to duplicate offsets and data loss.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.1" id="stuck-consumers-1"> Stuck Consumers (#1)</h2>
<p>In 0.1.0 through 0.1.3-rc.8 our final read phase often stalled. Calls to <code>consumer.poll()</code> would return immediately with no records, even though thousands of acknowledged records remained in the log. This would continue for tens of seconds to over an hour, until either the test gave up waiting or Bufstream decided to deliver records to consumers again. This weakened our tests: those unseen records may have had safety issues, but without observing them we had no way to tell.</p>
<p>For instance, this <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/bufstream-0.1.0/0.1.3-rc2-unseen.zip">test run</a> sent 691 acknowledged records in the first 120 seconds, then shifted to final reads. At that time, 40 of those acknowledged writes had never been observed by any poller. This situation persisted for over an hour as calls to <code>consumer.poll()</code> repeatedly returned no results. Finally, the test timed out.</p>
<p><img src="https://jepsen.io/analyses/bufstream-0.1.0/unseen.png" alt="A timeseries plot of unseen records over time, broken down by key. Three keys have a steady count of 40 unseen records that last until approximately 3788 seconds."><br>
</p>
<p>In other cases consumers would get stuck waiting for thousands of unseen records. Then after hundreds of seconds—for no apparent reason—Bufstream would rapidly produce the remaining values. We saw this behavior in all kinds of situations, including healthy clusters, but it was most pronounced with faults.</p>
<p>Bufstream made two patches in 0.1.3-rc.6 to help with this issue. First, when restarted, a Bufstream node could sometimes return stale, cached values for the last stable offset and high watermark.<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> This caused some client libraries to stall, assuming no later records were available (#1). Refreshing the cache on startup resolved this issue. We discuss the second patch (#3) later in this report, as it also had safety consequences.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.2" id="stuck-producers-consumers-2"> Stuck Producers &amp; Consumers (#2)</h2>
<p>Unfortunately we continued to see regular issues with unseen writes on 0.1.3-rc.6, in response to pauses, crashes, or partitions affecting the coordinator, storage, or Bufstream nodes. In some cases, a coordinator pause could cause every Bufstream node to enter a state where the process was running, but clients <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/bufstream-0.1.0/0.1.3-rc6-hung.zip">would time out</a> waiting for calls to <code>InitProducerId</code>. In other cases calls to <code>listOffsets</code> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/bufstream-0.1.0/0.1.3-rc6-hung-2.zip">would fail</a> with messages like <code>node 2008741112 being disconnected</code> or, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/bufstream-0.1.0/0.1.3-rc6-hung-3.zip">alternatively</a> because they <code>timed out waiting for a node assignment</code>. Calls to <code>poll</code> would complete but return no results. Killing and restarting Bufstream nodes resolved these issues. We call these metastable failures: a brief interruption in (e.g.) connectivity to the coordinator could cause long-lasting partial (or total!) unavailability in Bufstream agents.</p>
<p>Bufstream uses <a href="https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4/learning/api/#lease-api">etcd leases</a> to keep track of active Bufstream agents. Each agent subscribed, via its etcd client, to updates affecting a set of leased keys. Despite setting long timeouts, brief pauses or partitions caused etcd to delete keys tied to an agent’s lease, but updates reflecting those deletions were not necessarily relayed by the client to the agent itself. In essence, an agent would be unaware that it had lost its lease. The Bufstream team added additional polling logic to work around this problem, and unseen writes were largely resolved by 0.1.3-rc.8.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.3" id="spurious-zero-offsets-3"> Spurious Zero Offsets (#3)</h2>
<p>In versions 0.1.0 through 0.1.3-rc.2, a sent value could be assigned offset <code>0</code> (even if offset <code>0</code> had already been assigned far earlier in the test), then appear at a higher, more reasonable offset. Only the sender observed offset zero; pollers always observed the higher offset. This occurred when either etcd or Bufstream paused, or crashed, or a network partition occurred between the two.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/bufstream-0.1.0/0.1.0-inconsistent.zip">this two-minute test run</a> with a single Bufstream node, wherein we induced brief pauses in the etcd process. Six writes were assigned offset <code>0</code>, then appeared at a second, higher offset. On key <code>6</code>, value <code>26</code> was assigned offset <code>0</code> on send, then appeared at offset <code>25</code> in polls. On key <code>9</code>, <code>224</code> was assigned offset <code>0</code>, then appeared at <code>223</code>, and so on. Our checker reported these as duplicates:</p>

<p>Key <code>9</code> actually had five values at offset <code>0</code>: value <code>1</code> (which was stable), <code>67</code>, <code>68</code>, <code>69</code>, and <code>224</code>. This caused our checker to report inconsistent offsets:</p>

<p>We could reproduce this behavior readily—it occurred roughly every five minutes. However, Bufstream initially struggled to reproduce it.</p>
<p>This issue was caused by Bufstream omitting a field from the error responses sent to clients. Imagine that Bufstream sent a message to etcd to commit a new record in the log, and etcd processed that request. However, due to a process pause or network partition, Bufstream might time out waiting for a response from etcd, and send an error back to the client. While Bufstream’s response included an error code, it did <em>not</em> set the offset for the sent record to the special value <code>-1</code>, which some clients relied on as a signal of an error. Consequently, the official Java client we used in our tests interpreted this error as a successful response with offset <code>0</code>. Bufstream’s test suite used <a href="https://github.com/twmb/franz-go">Franz-go</a>, which interpreted these messages as errors. This meant that Bufstream’s test suite did not encounter this issue.</p>
<p>Bufstream fixed this issue in version 0.1.3-rc.6, and we have not observed it since.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.4" id="lost-transaction-writes-4"> Lost Transaction Writes (#4)</h2>
<p>Version 0.1.2 exhibited frequent write loss. Records written as a part of a committed transaction could vanish, never to be seen again. Readers would simply skip over those records as if they had never existed. For example, consider <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/bufstream-0.1.0/0.1.2-lost-write.zip">this test run</a>. In just 100 seconds and 6,761 write transactions, 240 records written by committed transactions were lost. Key <code>5</code>, for instance, had a successful write of value <code>141</code>:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1">{<span>:type</span> <span>:ok</span>,</span>
<span id="cb4-2"> <span>:process</span> <span>7</span>,</span>
<span id="cb4-3"> <span>:f</span> <span>:send</span>,</span>
<span id="cb4-4"> <span>:value</span> [[<span>:send</span> <span>11</span> [<span>83</span> <span>48</span>]]</span>
<span id="cb4-5">         [<span>:send</span> <span>5</span> [<span>274</span> <span>141</span>]]]}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since this transaction committed successfully, we know that key <code>5</code> should have stored value <code>141</code> at offset <code>274</code>. However, every call to <code>consumer.poll()</code> would skip over that offset, returning values like:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">[[<span>272</span> <span>140</span>]</span>

<span id="cb5-7"> ...]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This behavior happened regularly in healthy clusters, even with just a single Bufstream node. It was caused by a new concurrency safety mechanism added in 0.1.2 to mitigate the lack of idempotence in Kafka’s transaction protocol. Bufstream nodes assigned a unique number to each transaction performed by a producer within a given epoch, allowing Bufstream to safely retry some internal operations. However, a bug in the logic for tracking transaction numbers caused some transaction commits to be erroneously ignored when multiple transactions were committed across multiple epochs. This caused transactions which appeared to commit to actually abort, or vice versa.</p>
<p>Bufstream’s internal integration and unit tests initially missed this bug—we only caught it with the Jepsen test suite because of our choice of an unusually low (one second) transaction timeout. Luckily we identified the problem within a few hours of 0.1.2’s release. Bufstream took action to prevent customers from upgrading to 0.1.2, and none did. The issue was fixed in 0.1.3-rc2.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.5" id="lost-writes-due-to-server-side-filtering-5"> Lost Writes Due to Server-Side Filtering (#5)</h2>
<p>In version 0.1.3-rc.8, we regularly found short windows of write loss in response to minor faults, like pausing a Bufstream process or the coordinator, or a partition between the two. Data loss occurred both with and without transactions. Take <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/bufstream-0.1.0/0.1.3-rc.8-write-loss.zip">this five-minute test run</a> in which 22 out of 16,770 records were acknowledged, but never polled by any consumer. On key 12, value 663 was written at offset 662:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1">{<span>:type</span> <span>:ok</span>,</span>
<span id="cb6-2"> <span>:process</span> <span>38</span>,</span>

<span id="cb6-4"> <span>:value</span> [[<span>:send</span> <span>12</span> [<span>662</span> <span>663</span>]]]}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, every poller skipped over value 663 (and 664, which was also acknowledged). They read 665, then missed 666, 667, and so on:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1">{<span>:type</span> <span>:ok</span>,</span>

<p>Sometimes records would be visible to pollers for a time, then missing from later polls. In <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/bufstream-0.1.0/0.1.3-rc.8-int-poll-skip.zip">this test run</a> with process crashes, Bufstream acknowledged the writes of values <code>101</code> through <code>106</code> at roughly 1.37 seconds into the test. These records were visible to pollers until 1.88 seconds. After that, pollers simply skipped over the records as if they had never existed.</p>
<p>To work around a bug in a popular Kafka web GUI, Bufstream introduced logic in 0.1.3-rc.8 to more strictly limit the size of responses to the fetch API. However, a bug in that filtering logic caused Bufstream to hide records from some lagging consumers—which manifested as write loss. Bufstream fixed this issue in 0.1.3-rc.12.</p>
<h2 data-number="4" id="kafka-results"> Kafka Results</h2>
<p>In the course of our research we uncovered several issues with the Kafka Java client, documentation, and protocol design. We present four of these issues here. These affect Kafka, Bufstream, and presumably any Kafka-compatible system.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.1" id="a-misleading-error-message-kip-588"> A Misleading Error Message (KIP-588)</h2>
<p>During our testing we encountered frequent errors like <code>ProducerFencedException: There is a newer producer with the same transactionalId which fences the current one.</code> This was particularly vexing in tests where every producer received a unique transactional ID. We spent a good deal of time verifying that producers were initialized at most once, that data from past runs was not leaking into the present, and so on. Finally, the Bufstream team identified <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-588%3A+Allow+producers+to+recover+gracefully+from+transaction+timeouts">KIP-588</a>, which notes that a ProducerFencedException is <em>also</em> thrown for a transaction timeout:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the producer goes back online and attempts to proceed, it will receive the exact <code>ProducerFenced</code> even though a conflicting producer doesn’t exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kafka’s Java client uses a dedicated <code>TimeoutException</code> for most timeouts, but throws <code>ProducerFencedException</code> for this particular kind of timeout instead. When this happens, the error message lies to the user, asserting a second instance of the producer exists when none actually does. KIP-588 has been open for two years; we recommend the Kafka team change this error message.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.2" id="closing-a-consumer-can-block-indefinitely-kafka-17734"> Closing a Consumer Can Block Indefinitely (KAFKA-17734)</h2>
<p>Our tests against both Bufstream and Kafka got stuck every few hours thanks to a bug in the Java client. Calls to <code>Consumer.close()</code> block on network IO by default. There is a timeout parameter which is supposed to prevent calls to <code>close()</code> from blocking indefinitely, but it doesn’t work. Neither does spawning a separate thread specifically to call <code>consumer.wakeup()</code>, which is intended to safely interrupt a consumer stuck in IO.</p>
<p>Long-running programs should be robust to network errors. This means they should be able to reliably tear down clients and their associated resources—connections, threads, allocated memory, and so on—in a reasonable amount of time. We filed <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17734">KAFKA-17734</a> to track this issue.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.3" id="unpredictable-consumer-offsets-after-transaction-failure-kafka-17582"> Unpredictable Consumer Offsets After Transaction Failure (KAFKA-17582)</h2>
<p>Kafka’s <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/">official</a> <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/38/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.html">documentation</a> is largely silent about the intended behavior for consumer offsets when a transaction fails to commit. Should the consumer rewind, such that the next transaction’s polls begin with the first records observed by the aborted transaction? Or should it continue advancing, polling subsequent records? The original transaction proposal, <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=66854913#KIP98ExactlyOnceDeliveryandTransactionalMessaging-TransactionalGuarantees">KIP-98</a>, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Further, since consumer progress is recorded as a write to the offsets topic, the above capability is leveraged to enable applications to batch consumed and produced messages into a single atomic unit, ie. a set of messages may be considered consumed only if the entire ‘consume-transform-produce’ executed in its entirety.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confluent’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240908235227/docs.confluent.io/kafka/design/delivery-semantics.html">Kafka design documentation</a> goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the transaction is aborted, the consumer’s position reverts to its old value and you can specify whether output topics are visible to other consumers using the <code>isolation_level</code> property.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It makes sense that consumers should rewind on abort. After all, aborting a transaction in any system generally undoes its effects. More critically, Kafka users typically want at-least-once delivery—advancing to later offsets could mark records from the aborted transaction as committed even though they had never been processed. In fact the official Java client does rewind, but only <em>sometimes</em>.</p>
<p>We first encountered this behavior in the queue workload, where it manifested <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/bufstream-0.1.0/kafka-subscribe-rollback.zip">as write loss</a> during a variety of faults, both with Bufstream and Kafka. We designed the abort workload to follow up and found that even in healthy clusters, aborts led to unpredictable outcomes. For instance, here are results from <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/bufstream-0.1.0/kafka-abort.zip">a five-minute abort test</a> with no fault injection. Most pairs of transactions advanced to later offsets, but some rewound to earlier ones. Some rewound to the start of the transaction, and others rewound even further. All rewinds were associated with a rebalance event, and all advances had no rebalances.</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1">{[<span>:advance</span> <span>:none</span>]             <span>17048</span>,</span>

<span id="cb8-3"> [<span>:rewind</span> <span>:rebalance</span>]         <span>476</span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For example, process 0, interacting with topic-partition <code>t374</code>, aborted a transaction which polled records <code>12</code> through <code>14</code>. Then it went on to poll and commit later records. Offsets 12 through 17 were effectively lost.<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1">{<span>:process</span> <span>0</span>,</span>
<span id="cb9-2"> <span>:type</span>    <span>:fail</span>,</span>

<span id="cb9-4"> <span>:value</span>   {<span>:topic</span>   <span>"t374"</span>,</span>
<span id="cb9-5">           <span>:offsets</span> [<span>12</span> <span>14</span> <span>15</span> <span>17</span>],</span>

<span id="cb9-7">{<span>:process</span> <span>0</span>,</span>
<span id="cb9-8"> <span>:type</span>    <span>:ok</span>,</span>

<p>On the other hand, if a rebalance occurred consumers could rewind to earlier offsets, preventing data loss. For example, process 15, consuming from topic-partition <code>t1208</code>, was reassigned to that same topic. That rebalance event reset the consumer’s position from offset 5 to offset 0, causing it to rewind further than the most recent aborted transaction:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">{<span>:process</span> <span>15</span>,</span>

<p>We opened <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17582">KAFKA-17582</a> to ask for clarification, and learned that this behavior is intentional. Consumers continue advancing, unless they happen to be rebalanced, in which case they might rewind to an arbitrary point—whatever happens to be committed. Users are supposed to manually rewind the consumer’s position on transaction abort. Indeed, one of Kafka’s demonstration programs <a href="https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/2.5/examples/src/main/java/kafka/examples/ExactlyOnceMessageProcessor.java#L132">includes a rewind method</a> for exactly this reason.</p>
<p>This directly contradicts Confluent’s documentation. It also runs contrary to KIP-98’s statement that “a set of messages may be considered consumed only if the entire ‘consume-transform-produce’ executed in its entirety.” KIP-98’s example code contains no rewind, and we could not locate any documentation guiding users to rewind by hand. We suggested that Kafka document this behavior, and consider changing consumers to rewind by default on transaction abort. We also updated our queue workload to explicitly rewind consumers.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.4" id="write-loss-aborted-reads-torn-transactions-kafka-17754"> Write Loss, Aborted Reads, Torn Transactions (KAFKA-17754)</h2>
<p>In Bufstream 0.1.0 through 0.1.3 we observed aborted read, lost writes, and atomicity violations with as little as pausing or crashing the Bufstream process, or the coordinator, or a network partition. These behaviors led us to a fundamental flaw in the Kafka transaction protocol. For example, take <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/bufstream-0.1.0/0.1.3-rc.9-g1a-2.zip">this queue test of version 0.1.3-rc.9</a>. The test harness executed the following transaction, but aborted it intentionally:</p>

<p>Process 76 selected the unique transactional ID <code>jt1234</code> on initialization. From packet captures and Bufstream debug logs, we see <code>jt1234</code> used producer ID <code>233</code>, submitted all four operations, then sent an <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/protocol#The_Messages_EndTxn"><code>EndTxn</code></a> request with <code>committed = false</code>, which denotes a transaction abort. However, fifteen separate calls to <code>poll()</code> observed this transaction’s write of <code>424</code> to key <code>5</code>—a clear case of aborted read. Even stranger, <em>no</em> poller observed the other writes from this transaction: key <code>17</code> apparently never received values <code>926</code> or <code>927</code>. Why?</p>
<p>Close inspection of the packet capture, combined with Bufstream’s logs, allowed us to reconstruct what happened. A few transactions prior, process 76 began a transaction which sent <code>1018</code> to key <code>15</code>. It sent an <code>EndTxn</code> message to commit that transaction to node <code>n3</code>. However, it did not receive a prompt response. The client then quietly sent a <em>second</em> commit message to <code>n4</code>, which returned OK, and the test harness’s call to <code>commitTransaction</code> completed successfully. The process then began and intentionally aborted a second transaction, which completed OK. So far, so good.</p>

<p>Then process 76 began a third, problematic transaction. It sent <code>424</code> to key <code>5</code> and added new partitions to the transaction. Just after accepting record <code>424</code>, node <code>n3</code> received the delayed commit message from two transactions ago. This committed the current transaction, effectively tearing it in half. The first half (sending <code>424</code> to key <code>5</code>) was committed and visible to pollers. The second half (sending <code>926</code> and <code>927</code> to key <code>17</code>) implicitly began a second transaction, which was then aborted by the client.</p>
<p>This suggests a fundamental problem in the Kafka transaction protocol. <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/protocol">The protocol is designed</a> to allow clients to submit requests over multiple TCP connections and to distribute them across multiple nodes. There is no sequence number to order requests from the same client. There is no concept of a transaction number.<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> When a server receives a commit (or abort) message, it has no way to know what transaction the client intended to commit. It simply commits (or aborts) whatever transaction happens to be in progress.</p>
<p>This means transactions which appeared to commit could actually abort, and vice versa: we observed both aborted reads and lost writes. It also means transactions could be cut in half: a single transaction could have some of its writes lost, and others preserved. We don’t know a name for this anomaly. It’s clearly a violation of atomicity, but “atomic” is a somewhat vague term. If a reader observed some but not all of a different transaction’s writes we would call it a <em>fractured read</em>, but this anomaly occurs on the write path: no (<code>read_committed</code>) poller will ever observe the lost writes. We call this behavior a <em>torn transaction</em>.<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>What does it take to get this behavior? First, an <code>EndTxn</code> message must be delayed, for instance due to network latency, packet loss, a slow computer, garbage collection, etc. Second, while that <code>EndTxn</code> arrow is hovering in the air, the client needs to move on to perform a second transaction using the same producer ID and epoch. There are several ways this could happen.</p>
<p>First, users could explicitly retry committing or aborting a transaction. The docs say they can, and the client won’t stop them. Second, the official Kafka Java client docs <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/38/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/KafkaProducer.html">repeatedly instruct users</a> to call <code>abortTransaction</code> if an error occurs during <code>commitTransaction</code>.<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Following the documentation’s example leads directly to this behavior: if <code>commitTransaction</code> times out, one calls <code>abortTransaction</code>, and there are now multiple <code>EndTxn</code> messages in flight. Third, even if users try to avoid this by only calling <code>commitTransaction</code> <em>or</em> <code>abortTransaction</code>, the client’s internal retry mechanism <a href="https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/8125c3da5bb6ebb35a0cb3494624d33fad4e3187/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/errors/TimeoutException.java#L22">treats timeouts as retryable</a> and sends multiple <code>EndTxn</code> messages automatically. In the above example, process 76 called commit or abort exactly once for every transaction it ever performed, and it still hit data loss.</p>
<p>We observed aborted reads and torn transactions due to process pauses <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/bufstream-0.1.0/kafka-g1a.zip">in Kafka as well</a>, and opened <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17754">KAFKA-17754</a> to track the issue. Kafka’s engineers believe <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-890%3A+Transactions+Server-Side+Defense">KIP-890</a>, which was motivated by hanging transactions in Kafka, will likely fix the problem. In brief, KIP-890 revises the transaction protocol to bump the producer’s epoch on every transaction. Since servers reject messages from older epochs, this should prevent commit messages from prior transactions leaking into later ones. KIP-890 <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=235834634">was opened in November 2022</a>, and <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14402">work is ongoing</a>.</p>
<p>Bufstream has added a mechanism in 0.1.3 to reduce the frequency of these issues. Bufstream nodes now use the most recently observed etcd revision—a global, monotonically increasing integer coupled to the system state as a whole—as a logical clock on <code>AddPartitionsToTxn</code> and <code>EndTxn</code> messages. If an <code>EndTxn</code> message attempts to commit or abort a transaction with a newer <code>AddPartitionsToTxn</code>, Bufstream returns a non-retryable error. Of course this order is only known once RPC messages arrive on Bufstream nodes; it does not prevent reorderings that occur between the client and Bufstream itself. Indeed, we continue to observe aborted read, lost writes, and torn transactions in 0.1.3. We must wait for clients to resolve this issue.</p>

<h2 data-number="5" id="discussion"> Discussion</h2>
<p>We found two liveness and three safety issues in Bufstream proper. Two issues (#1 and #2) involved consumers or producers getting stuck, sometimes indefinitely. One (#3) involved Bufstream returning <code>0</code> rather than <code>-1</code> for a sent record which failed indefinitely. The official Java client interpreted this response as a success, rather than an error. Two issues allowed the loss of committed writes due to a bug in a concurrency control mechanism (#4) and a bug in a filter to limit response sizes (#5). We identified both #4 and #5 before production users were affected. As of version 0.1.3, all five issues are resolved.</p>
<p>However, Bufstream continues to exhibit aborted reads, lost writes, and torn transactions due to the design of the Kafka transaction protocol (KAFKA-17754). These issues cannot be resolved without the help of the Kafka team and client implementers. We also note three other Kafka issues, including an incorrect error message (KIP-588), a deadlock in <code>ConsumerClient.close()</code> (KAFKA-17734), and the lack of any authoritative documentation for transaction semantics (KAFKA-17671).</p>
<p>As always, we caution that Jepsen takes an experimental approach to safety verification: we can prove the presence of bugs, but not their absence. While we make extensive efforts to find problems, we cannot prove correctness. In particular, KAFKA-17754 makes it difficult to determine if there are <em>other</em> cases of (e.g.) write loss in Bufstream.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.1" id="bufstream-recommendations"> Bufstream Recommendations</h2>
<p>Bufstream users who use the official Java Kafka client should be aware that transactions are, at present, unsafe. Aborted transactions could actually commit, committed transactions could actually abort, and transactions could be torn in half, preserving some but not all of their effects. Bufstream believes the Franz-go client is less susceptible to this problem, but we have not tested it using the same techniques as the present work. Other clients may or may not be susceptible. While Bufstream is trying to reduce the frequency of these issues, they cannot prevent them entirely. That power lies with the Kafka team and client implementers.</p>
<p>Bufstream users prior to 0.1.3 should be aware that calls to <code>producer.send()</code> might incorrectly return a zero offset for a record, rather than the actual offset. They may also encounter metastable availability issues where clients get “stuck.” We recommend upgrading to 0.1.3.</p>
<p>Bufstream’s overall architecture appears sound: relying on a coordination service like etcd to establish the order of immutable chunks of data is a relatively straightforward approach with years of <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/Architecture-Datomic/">prior art</a> in both OLTP and streaming systems. Kafka’s attention to KIP-588, additional deployment experience, and further testing should help identify and resolve any remaining safety bugs. In the meantime, we made two small operational recommendations for Bufstream.</p>
<p>First, we suggested Bufstream retry a network operation that often caused clusters to crash. Bufstream requests a shared file in storage on startup, as a safety check designed to prevent users from accidentally running two different Bufstream clusters on top of the same storage bucket. Bufstream exits if it can’t complete this request. This caused Bufstream to crash roughly one in thirty tests, due to <code>404 not found</code> responses from storage. Bufstream has added a layer of retries, and intends to further ameliorate this issue by retrying indefinitely while refusing client connections. Version 0.1.3 appears significantly more robust on startup.</p>
<p>Second, Jepsen suggested that Bufstream processes try to keep running when their dependencies are unavailable. Presently, agents kill themselves when they lose access to storage or the coordinator, and rely on a supervisor system like Kubernetes to restart them. This works, but it requires operators to run their own supervisor. It may also impact performance and availability. Clients must tear down and re-open TCP connections, which could create thundering-herd issues. Bufstream processes may also need to do special work on restarting: fetching resources from storage, warming caches, re-connecting to etcd, and so on. Generally speaking, services should try to keep running when their dependencies become unavailable—the service can offer backpressure, advise clients of system status, and generally recover more gracefully. Bufstream has added additional retry logic for etcd, but as of 0.1.3, still requires constant supervision to stay online. We also recommend users verify that they have a process supervisor in place, and test that it works correctly (rather than giving up) during prolonged outages.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.2" id="kafka-needs-transaction-docs"> Kafka Needs Transaction Docs</h2>
<p>Kafka’s official documentation says almost nothing about transactions, leaving users to piece together behavior from a maze of vague, confusing, and contradictory sources. We encouraged the Kafka team to write an official, centralized, easy-to-find document which lays out the intended semantics of transactions: <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17671">KAFKA-17671</a>. This document should specify exactly what users must do to use transactions safely, and what invariants they can expect in return. For instance, it should describe the rules for offsets visible to a single producer or consumer:</p>
<ul>
<li>When will a consumer observe monotonically increasing offsets?</li>
<li>When will a consumer skip over acknowledged records?</li>
<li>Is this behavior different within a single call to <code>poll</code>, versus between two subsequent calls?</li>
<li>Can a rebalance take effect in the middle of a transaction? How do rebalances affect transaction semantics?</li>
<li>When will records sent by a producer to a single topic-partition have monotonically increasing offsets?</li>
<li>When will those offsets be interleaved with writes from other producers?</li>
<li>For both consumers and producers, how do these behaviors differ within a transaction vs.&nbsp;between two subsequent transactions on the same client?</li>
</ul>
<p>This document should also explain the isolation properties of transactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>When is G0 (write cycle) legal?</li>
<li>When is G1a (aborted read) legal?</li>
<li>When is G1b (intermediate read) legal?</li>
<li>When is G1c (circular information flow) legal?</li>
<li>What particular cycles are prohibited, if any? For example, are cycles composed entirely of write-read edges proscribed?</li>
<li>When is fractured read legal? That is, when can a transaction observe some, but not all, of another transaction’s effects?</li>
<li>Is it legal to read values written inside the current transaction?</li>
</ul>
<p>It should describe the semantics of aborted transactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are explicitly aborted transactions different from those which (e.g.) crash before committing?</li>
<li>Are the values and offsets returned by <code>poll()</code> correct even if the transaction aborts?</li>
<li>What offsets should a consumer poll after a transaction crashes?</li>
<li>How should users navigate <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-1050%3A+Consistent+error+handling+for+Transactions">Kafka’s maze of transaction errors</a>?</li>
<li>How should users handle errors that occur during the transaction abort process, or during rewind?</li>
</ul>
<p>… and clarify other ambiguities in the existing documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the “committed position” the offset of the highest committed record, or the uncommitted offset one higher?</li>
<li>Is it safe to let multiple transactional IDs process records from the same topic-partitions?</li>
</ul>
<p>We also recommend that Confluent align their safety claims with Kafka’s behavior. Confluent <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/kafka/design/delivery-semantics.html">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/clients/consumer.html">claims</a> that Kafka offers at-least-once delivery by default. This is untrue: <code>enable.auto.commit = true</code>, and <code>auto.offset.reset = latest</code> allow records to be marked “committed” despite never being processed. Those same docs incorrectly claim that consumers rewind offsets on transaction abort. They do not, and this too could lead to data loss. Either the default behaviors should be changed, or the documentation updated.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.3" id="kafka-transactions-are-broken"> Kafka Transactions are Broken</h2>
<p>The Kafka transaction protocol is fundamentally broken and must be revised. As we showed in KAFKA-17754, anyone who uses the official Java Kafka client with Bufstream, Kafka, or presumably any Kafka-compatible system may observe aborted reads, lost writes, and torn transactions. These break the <a href="https://developer.confluent.io/courses/architecture/transactions/">most basic safety guarantees</a> Kafka transactions are supposed to provide.</p>
<p>The crux of the problem is that Kafka’s transaction system implicitly assumes ordered, reliable delivery where none exists. Processes pause, networks <a href="http://www.bailis.org/papers/partitions-queue2014.pdf">are not reliable</a>, latency <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322500050_Fallacies_of_Distributed_Computing_Explained">is non-zero</a>, and delivery across different TCP sockets is fundamentally unordered. Kafka’s protocol distributes messages across different nodes and TCP sockets <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/protocol#protocol_network">by design</a>. Clients automatically retry messages, leading to duplicates. The protocol includes neither a sequence number to reconstruct the order of messages sent by a single client,<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> nor a transaction number to ensure messages affect the right transaction.</p>
<p>On top of this unreliable foundation, the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=235834631#KIP890:TransactionsServerSideDefense-Motivation">Kafka transaction protocol</a> is an ordered state machine. <code>Produce</code> and <code>EndTxn</code> messages add records to, commit, or abort, whatever transaction happens to be ongoing at the time. Producer epochs provide a logical clock, but nothing ensures order <em>within</em> an epoch, and epochs are incremented infrequently. This demonstrates the importance of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">end-to-end principle</a> in protocol design: the client and transaction state machine must explicitly encode and enforce ordering “at the edges,” rather than relying on the unreliable network between them.</p>
<p><a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-890%3A+Transactions+Server-Side+Defense">KIP-890</a> intends to ensure a stricter order by incrementing the epoch on every transaction commit. Client libraries could also help by re-initializing producers (which bumps the epoch) when a message is not acknowledged.</p>
<p>We know the <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-clients/java/current/overview.html">official Java Kafka client</a> is vulnerable to this problem as of version 3.8.0. We believe <a href="https://github.com/twmb/franz-go">Franz-go</a> does re-initialize on timeouts, which could mitigate or prevent these issues. We haven’t investigated other client libraries.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.4" id="future-work"> Future Work</h2>
<p>Many users rely on the Kafka Streams API for “exactly-once semantics,” rather than performing transactions themselves. Future work could explore the correctness of Streams applications.</p>
<p>While investigating issues like KAFKA-17754, we also encountered unseen writes in Kafka. Owing to time constraints we have not investigated this behavior, but unseen writes could be a sign of hanging transactions, stuck consumers, or even data loss. We are curious whether a delayed <code>Produce</code> message could slide into a future transaction, violating transactional guarantees. We also suspect that the Kafka Java Client may reuse a sequence number when a request times out, causing writes to be acknowledged but silently discarded. More Kafka testing is warranted.</p>
<p>When a rebalance event occurs, the positions of consumers may shift forward or back. It is unclear what the rules are for these rebalances. Our test suite detected various cases of consumers or producers encountering internal (or external) non-monotonic (or skipped) sends (or polls). However, we are unsure when these behaviors are legal, and our checker does not report them as outright failures. Once Kafka documents intended behavior, we would like to verify it.</p>
<p>Jepsen is a random process. The generators of operations, thread scheduler, network and disk IO, services under test, and operating systems involved are all non-deterministic. We rely on anomalies being probable enough that they occur regularly across different, random test runs. This is an effective way to identify and resolve bugs that are likely to occur in real-world systems. However, it is a terrible way to explore rare behaviors: if an anomaly occurs once in a hundred hours of testing, debugging and reproducing it becomes arduous.</p>
<p>For example, we encountered a single case of <em>non-zero</em> duplicate offsets on 0.1.3-rc.2. In <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/bufstream-0.1.0/0.1.3-rc2-dup-nonzero.zip">this two-minute test run</a> with producer pauses, a process sent record <code>743</code> to key <code>9</code>, was assigned offset <code>1225</code>, and was able to poll the record at that offset. Other pollers begged to differ—every other process observed value <code>743</code> at offset <code>1219</code>. We were unable to reproduce this behavior after weeks of testing, and it could have been an error in our test harness. Lacking confidence, we opted not to include this in our findings. A reproducible test would have made discharging this issue significantly easier.</p>
<p>Bufstream also uses <a href="https://antithesis.com/">Antithesis</a>, a testing platform which runs an entire distributed system in a deterministic hypervisor and simulated network. This allows perfectly reproducible tests, and also lets testers rewind time to inspect the state of a system just before and after a bug occurred. We would like to combine Jepsen’s workload generation and history checking with Antithesis’ deterministic and replayable environment to make our tests more reproducible.</p>

In this major work, he analyzes over 2,100 educational meta-analyses exploring 357 different moderators affecting learning within the typical classroom. What he found was equal parts surprising and predictable: </span><em>nearly</em><span> </span><em>everything</em><span> has a positive impact on student learning. In fact, of the 357 included learning moderators, only 33 reported a negative effect size (this includes things like abuse, malnutrition, illness, and mental disorders). In other words, 91% of everything a teacher does can be said to improve learning.</span></p><p><span>Although this finding has doubtless been influenced by publication bias and the file-drawer problem, one additional practical explanation concerns </span><em><a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203701447-9/instruction-time-task-review-lorin-anderson" rel="">engaged</a></em><a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203701447-9/instruction-time-task-review-lorin-anderson" rel=""> </a><em><a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203701447-9/instruction-time-task-review-lorin-anderson" rel="">time-on-task</a></em><span>. Students spending any amount of time explicitly focused on learning novel material would be expected to demonstrate improvement compared to students spending no time focused on learning novel material, regardless of the specific tool or technique employed.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Seeing as nearly every strategy serves to increase engaged time-on-task (this includes employing air conditioning during hot days), then comparing the impact of digital technologies to ‘zero’ makes little sense. So, when considering effect sizes within education, what is a reasonable baseline? Acknowledging that this is a tricky metric within social science, yet remains the strongest representation of quantified impact we possess within education, what effect size would constitute ‘meaningful’ improvement?</p><p><span>Data suggests that in order for students to maintain a 50th percentile rank nationwide, they must improve an average of </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4696502/" rel="">0.42 standard deviations</a><span> per year (calculated using standardized reading and math data across K-12); anything below this will likely lead to declining rank and vice versa. A similar analysis places this </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19345740802400072" rel="">value at 0.46</a><span>, suggesting an effect size of around 0.44 would be a reasonable educational baseline. As a secondary estimate, when the effect size from all 357 moderators noted above are pooled, Hattie reports the average value sits at a less conservative </span><a href="https://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/" rel="">effect size of 0.4</a><span>. In fact, he calls this a ‘hinge-point’ and recommends that only those tools and/or strategies with values </span><a href="https://www.visiblelearning.com/content/visible-learning-research" rel="">above this level</a><span> can be seen to ‘work best’ and should be considered for mass inclusion across education, as those have the greatest chance to deliver the greatest impact to the greatest number of students.</span></p><p>Using the less conservative baseline of 0.4, the aforementioned meta-analyses look much weaker. In fact, the only realm within which digital tools seem to be meaningfully beneficial is in the realm of specific learning needs (a topic we will discuss later in this piece). Use of these tools outside of this context may well be driving learning; unfortunately, that learning will be slower, less robust, and likely lead to a drop in rank compared to other, more powerful, non-digital methods.</p><p>The fact that dozens of meta-analyses comprising thousands of calculated effect sizes has done little to quell excitement over digital technology in education suggests that we may be dealing less with an issue of evidence and more with an issue of wishful thinking.

Whatever ruleset is being held within this part of the brain will ultimately determine what the attentional filter deems relevant or irrelevant.</span></p><p><span>Here's the problem: the LatPFC can only hold onto </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18558854/" rel="">one ruleset</a><span> at a time.</span></p><p><span>This means anytime we attempt to consciously undertake two tasks simultaneously, the brain simply cannot handle this; the best it can do is quickly jump back-and-forth between tasks, </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10666562/" rel="">swapping out the ruleset</a><span> within the LatPFC each time.</span></p><p>This jumping between tasks incurs three significant costs.</p><blockquote><p><em>Time</em><span>: It takes the brain about 0.15 seconds to swap out a ruleset, during which time all external information stops being consciously processed and learning slows considerably (this process is called </span><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-00015-002" rel="">task-switching cost</a><span>).</span></p><p><em>Accuracy</em><span>: Whenever we jump between tasks, there is a brief period of time when the two rulesets conflict and general performance suffers (this process is called </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28104413/" rel="">cross-talk dual-task interference</a><span>).</span></p><p><em>Memory</em><span>: Memories are typically processed by a part of the brain called the hippocampus. However, when jumping between tasks, memories are more often processed </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16868087/" rel="">by the striatum</a><span> (an area of the brain linked to reflexive processes), ultimately leading to the formation of subconscious memories which are difficult to access and utilize in the future.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>In sum, </span><em>multitasking is among the worst things that students can do for learning and memory</em><span>. When we multitask, we go slower, our accuracy drops, and our learning decreases significantly.</span></p><p>Why does any of this matter?</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-edtech-revolution-has-failed/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-edtech-revolution-has-failed/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p>The primary function of any tool can be thought of as the main task or job said tool is believed to perform: or, as I often consider it, it’s the manner in which 80% of people spend 80% of their time employing said tool.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider a hammer.

Unfortunately, when we attempt to employ digital devices for learning purposes, this primary function quickly bleeds into student behavior.&nbsp;</p><p><span>This is why, when using a computer for homework, students typically last </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563212003305" rel="">fewer than 6 minutes</a><span> before accessing social media, messaging friends, and engaging with other digital distractions. This is why, when using a laptop during class, students typically spend </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131514001158" rel="">38 minutes of every hour</a><span> off-task. This is why, when getting paid as part of a research study to focus on a 20-minute computerized lesson, nearly </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131511002077" rel="">40% of students</a><span> were unable to stop themselves from multitasking. It’s not that the students of today have abnormally weak constitutions; it’s that they have spent thousands of hours training themselves to use digital devices in a manner guaranteed to impair learning and performance. It’s also that many of the apps being run on those devices were carefully engineered to pull young people away from whatever they were doing.</span></p><p>Perhaps we can draw an analogy: imagine I sat a group of people around a jug of beer and asked them to use that beer to learn about buoyancy. This tool (beer) is perfectly suited to the task, and if the group of people were non-drinkers, I would expect no problem achieving my learning goals. However, if the group of people were alcoholics - individuals who had spent thousands of hours training themselves to use beer in a manner that does not concern buoyancy - then the tool would most likely hinder my learning goals.</p><p><span>And perhaps this is the key point: I’m not saying that digital technologies </span><em>can’t</em><span> be used for learning; in fact, if these tools were only ever employed for learning purposes, then they may have proven some of the most important academic inventions ever. The argument I’m making is that digital technologies so often </span><em>aren’t </em><span>used for learning that giving students a laptop, tablet, or other multi-function device places a large (and unnecessary) obstacle between the student and the desired outcome. In order to effectively learn while using an unlocked, internet-connected multi-function digital device, students must expend a great deal of cognitive effort battling impulses that they’ve spent years honing - a battle they lose more often than not. (of course schools do often try to implement blockers and restrictions, but this opens up an eternal cat-and-mouse struggle, and the mice are very good at finding ways to evade the cat.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>To be fair, even before digital devices took over the classroom, students struggled with lack of attention, shallow thinking, overconfidence, and other learning problems. However, with digital devices, the frequency of these problems increases. Many schools were already struggling with issues of engagement, so we need to consider what additional harms may have occurred in the early 2010s when so many schools adopted tools that can be described as distraction machines.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing as enthusiasts can’t lean on empirical data to support the adoption of student facing, internet connected digital devices across education, they frequently turn to three seemingly compelling arguments to excuse the lack of clear evidence of effectiveness. When placed in context, however, these arguments lose a lot of their exculpatory power.</p><p><span>It’s easy to get swept up in the promise of computers in education. Returning to the </span><a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/publication/will-technology-transform-education-better" rel="">J-PAL review</a><span> quoted earlier, after concluding that computers do not benefit learning, this group goes on to state:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><em>Computer assisted learning shows considerable promise…against this backdrop, promising uses of education technology have the potential to support massive inroads in learning</em><span>.”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Potential is what something </span><em>could</em><span> be, what it </span><em>should</em><span> be, and what we </span><em>hope</em><span> it will be – not what it </span><em>actually</em><span> is. This means that arguments from potential do not accurately reflect reality; rather, they reflect the faith, belief, and desires of the speaker. In fact, when people say that computers have the potential to drive student learning, they are tacitly acknowledging that these tools are not currently achieving this aim.</span></p><p>I am not arguing against having hope for EdTech; there is a good chance that somebody will someday create a program that outshines even the best teachers in the world. I am simply pointing out that this has not yet happened, and that promissory arguments are not a solid enough foundation upon which to change educational practice at&nbsp; mass scale.</p><p>Health insurance. Taxes. Video games. Dating, marriage, and divorce. Mortgages. Laundry. Student loans. Litigation. Self-defense. First aid. Pet care. Superannuation. Yoga.</p><p>I mention these things to highlight that just because something is ubiquitous does not mean it needs to be explicitly taught in school. Teachers have long recognized that they are not alone in the journey of education, and that many essential concepts are meant to be passed along by parents, peers, society, and life experience.</p><p><span>With that said, an argument could be made that schools </span><em>should</em><span> be teaching these ubiquitous subjects; that it’s the responsibility of education to ensure all students are well versed in those things they are certain to encounter in their adult lives.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I think this argument has some merit.</p><p><span>However, to argue that a topic </span><em>should be taught</em><span> is far different than arguing that all things should be taught </span><em>through that topic</em><span>. The former is an argument about curriculum; the latter is an argument about pedagogy. For instance, you might believe we should teach table manners to students (curriculum), but that’s different than arguing we should teach all classes in a dining room over dinner (pedagogy).&nbsp; Determining </span><em>what </em><span>to teach and </span><em>how </em><span>to teach are two very different considerations.</span></p><p><span>Here is where the excuse from ubiquity goes awry. Through some linguistic alchemy, the argument “we should teach computer skills” has morphed into “we should teach all skills through a computer.” Teachers around the world are being asked by </span><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2021-01-21-jeff-bezos-wants-to-go-to-the-moon-then-public-education" rel="">developers</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/nyregion/banks-migrants-nyc-schools.html" rel="">politicians</a><span>, and their own </span><a href="https://www.edweek.org/technology/why-principals-are-embracing-personalized-learning/2018/04" rel="">principals </a><span>to adopt digital technologies within their classroom, even if these tools aren’t well suited to the learning goals these teachers desire.</span></p><p><span>Although teaching computer processes, coding skills, and digital etiquette are </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563217302510#:~:text=It%20finds%20that%20computer%20skills%20not%20only%20mitigate%20worker%20displacement,to%20other%20types%20of%20jobs." rel="">worthwhile goals</a><span> (curriculum), it does not follow that we must reconfigure all academic subjects to achieve this goal. When it comes to effective teaching and learning (pedagogy), we should select the tool best suited to the job; not the tool that is most prevalent. Just as power tools are confined to the woodshop and Bunsen burners are confined to the science lab, perhaps student-facing digital devices should be confined to a dedicated computer lab within school; they should not be freely available whenever and wherever. Or perhaps devices should be disconnected from the internet and/or locked using an LMS system that only allows for specific programs to be employed.&nbsp; Employing mediated devices or a singular location may ensure that teachers choosing to employ tech have a clear reason for doing so, and students choosing to employ tech have oversight and less opportunity for detrimental multitasking.</span></p><p><span>As referenced earlier, following a three-year analysis of hundreds of thousands of data points and concluding that computers significantly reduce learning, the </span><a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/students-computers-and-learning_9789264239555-en.html" rel="">OECD report went on to state</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><em>One interpretation of all this is that building deep, conceptual understanding and higher-order thinking requires intensive teacher-student interaction…Another interpretation is that we have not yet become good enough at the kind of pedagogies that make the most of technology.</em><span>”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>In the interest of digging deeper, let’s give this excuse the benefit of the doubt. If computers are in fact being used incorrectly in schools, then what is the correct way to use them? As </span><a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/students-computers-and-learning_9789264239555-en.html" rel="">the OECD report states</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“[Digital technology] is linked to better student performance…when computer software and internet connections help to increase study time and practice.”</em></p></blockquote><p>In case you missed it, let me rephrase that: learning improves when students spend more time learning.&nbsp;</p><p>This revelation is not unique to computers. Flashcards, workbooks, an empty milk jug, my great aunt Justine… as the work of John Hattie mentioned above reveals, when used to increase study time and practice, literally any tool will improve student performance. The relevant question is whether or not computers and tablets actually do lead to increased learning time. Unfortunately, as we’ve already established, the answer to this seems to be ‘no,’ they are at least as likely to increase time spent on video games, video watching, social media, and listening to music.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-edtech-revolution-has-failed?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-edtech-revolution-has-failed?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>While I am generally critical of the way that EdTech has been put into the hands of students, I do see two ways in which digital technologies can be extremely helpful for teachers and for students. The first concerns teaching. When digital tools are used and controlled by a well-trained teacher to drive pedagogy, then any problems of multitasking and distraction that occur due to student-facing digital technologies can be averted.</p><p><span>However, simply asking teachers to employ computers in their teaching will not, in itself, boost learning. It is essential that teachers continue to select the strongest pedagogical techniques, regardless of whichever tool they choose to employ. For instance, employing PowerPoint slides during a didactic lesson has sometimes been found to </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131512000140" rel="">impair the amount</a><span> of </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131508002017" rel="">verbal information</a><span> students retain. Again, this is not due to the tool itself; rather, it is determined by the way in which teachers choose to use this tool.</span></p><p>In the words of the great media scholar Neil Postman, “I do not say that [digital technologies], when used properly by a skilled teacher, will not help [learning], but I doubt that it can do better than pencil and paper, or speech itself, when used properly by a skilled teacher.” In other words, digital tools do not obviate the need for sound pedagogy; and sound pedagogy will rarely be dependent upon digital tools.</p><p>The second instance where EdTech may be helpful concerns issues of learning abatement. For instance, if learning is abated due to school closures necessitated by environmental disasters (e.g. poor air quality from fires), sociological upheavals (e.g. violent political protests), or health risks (e.g. local epidemics or global pandemics), then it’s worthwhile to employ digital technology as a solution.</p><p><span>With that said, issues of digital distraction, diminished impact, and socioeconomic divide persist or increase during these forms of digital-based distance education. In fact, in a </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/18/11188" rel="">recent survey</a><span>, 95% of students admit to media multitasking during distance learning,&nbsp; with 15% admitting going off-task over 30 times per session.</span></p><p>As another example, if learning is abated due deafness, blindness, orthopedic, or other forms of specific learning disabilities that preclude students from engaging with non-digital learning materials, then it’s worthwhile to employ digital technology as a solution.</p><p>In the end, if there is no other avenue or option for engaging with learning material besides digital technology, then we are well justified in employing it. However, if there are two or more options for engaging with learning material, then it is best to select the tool that will yield the best results. As we’ve seen, that tool will rarely be digital in nature.</p><p>Enough.</p><p><span>As mentioned above, we are seeing a shift away from digital reliance in schools across many </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/dutch-school-that-banned-mobile-phones-calvijn-college#:~:text=From%20the%20moment%20they%20began,after%20the%20ban%20was%20enacted." rel="">european</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/fast-growth-digital-technology-challenging-education-priorities-and-practices-south-east-asia#:~:text=A%20campaign%20%23TechOnOurTerms%20alongside%20the,discontinued%20due%20to%20implementation%20challenges." rel="">southeast asian</a><span> countries, not just Sweden. I urge readers to take these shifts seriously and look closely at emerging data in schools that reduce their use of EdTech. If the educational and cognitive research that I have discussed is accurate, then we should see not only improvements in student learning, but also improvements in student relationships, mental health, and physical wellbeing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <p>There’s no doubt that exercise does a body good. Regular activity not only strengthens muscles but can bolster our bones, blood vessels, and immune system.</p><p>Now, MIT engineers have found that exercise can also have benefits at the level of individual neurons. They observed that when muscles contract during exercise, they release a soup of biochemical signals called myokines. In the presence of these muscle-generated signals, neurons grew four times farther compared to neurons that were not exposed to myokines. These cellular-level experiments suggest that exercise can have a significant biochemical effect on nerve growth.</p><p>Surprisingly, the researchers also found that neurons respond not only to the biochemical signals of exercise but also to its physical impacts. The team observed that when neurons are repeatedly pulled back and forth, similarly to how muscles contract and expand during exercise, the neurons grow just as much as when they are exposed to a muscle’s myokines.</p><p>While previous studies have indicated a potential biochemical link between muscle activity and nerve growth, this study is the first to show that physical effects can be just as important, the researchers say.&nbsp;The results, which are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202403712" target="_blank">published today in the journal <em>Advanced Healthcare Materials</em></a>, shed light on the connection between muscles and nerves during exercise, and could inform exercise-related therapies for repairing damaged and deteriorating nerves.</p><p>“Now that we know this muscle-nerve crosstalk exists, it can be useful for treating things like nerve injury, where communication between nerve and muscle is cut off,” says Ritu Raman, the Eugene Bell Career Development Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT. “Maybe if we stimulate the muscle, we could encourage the nerve to heal, and restore mobility to those who have&nbsp;lost it due to traumatic injury or neurodegenerative diseases.”</p><p>Raman is the senior author of the new study, which includes Angel Bu, Ferdows Afghah, Nicolas Castro, Maheera Bawa, Sonika Kohli, Karina Shah, and Brandon Rios of MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, and Vincent Butty of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.</p><p><strong>Muscle talk</strong></p><p>In 2023, Raman and her colleagues&nbsp;<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/light-activated-muscle-grafts-show-promise-aiding-muscle-recovery-post-trauma-1030" target="_blank">reported</a> that they could restore mobility in mice that had experienced a traumatic muscle injury, by first implanting muscle tissue at the site of injury, then exercising the new tissue by stimulating it repeatedly with light. Over time, they found that the exercised graft helped mice to regain their motor function, reaching activity levels comparable to those of healthy mice.</p><p>When the researchers analyzed the graft itself, it appeared that regular exercise stimulated the grafted muscle to produce certain biochemical signals that are known to promote nerve and blood vessel growth.</p><p>“That was interesting because we always think that nerves control muscle, but we don’t think of muscles talking back to nerves,” Raman says. “So, we started to think stimulating muscle was encouraging nerve growth. And people replied that maybe that’s the case, but there’s hundreds of other cell types in an animal, and it’s really hard to prove that the nerve is growing more because of the muscle, rather than the immune system or something else playing a role.”</p><p>In their new study, the team set out to determine whether exercising muscles has any direct effect on how nerves grow, by focusing solely on muscle and nerve tissue. The researchers grew mouse muscle cells into long fibers that then fused to form a small sheet of mature muscle tissue about the size of a quarter.</p><p>The team genetically modified the muscle to contract in response to light. With this modification, the team could flash a light repeatedly, causing the muscle to squeeze in response, in a way that mimicked the act of exercise. Raman previously developed a novel&nbsp;<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/wobbly-gel-mat-trains-muscle-cells-work-together-1020" target="_blank">gel mat</a> on which to grow and exercise muscle tissue. The gel’s properties are such that it can support muscle tissue and prevent it from peeling away as the researchers stimulated the muscle to exercise.</p><p>The team then collected samples of the surrounding solution in which the muscle tissue was exercised, thinking that the solution should hold myokines, including growth factors, RNA, and a mix of other proteins.</p><p>“I would think of myokines as a biochemical soup of things that muscles secrete, some of which could be good for nerves and others that might have nothing to do with nerves,” Raman says. “Muscles are pretty much always secreting myokines, but when you exercise them, they make more.”</p><p><strong>“Exercise as medicine”</strong></p><p>The team transferred the myokine solution to a separate dish containing motor neurons — nerves found in the spinal cord that control muscles involved in voluntary movement. The researchers grew the neurons from stem cells derived from mice. As with the muscle tissue, the neurons were grown on a similar gel mat. After the neurons were exposed to the myokine mixture, the team observed that they quickly began to grow, four times faster than neurons that did not receive the biochemical solution.</p>

            MIT scientists find that motor neuron growth increased significantly over 5 days in response to biochemical and mechanical signals related to exercise. The green ball represents cluster of neurons that grow outward in long tails, or axons.

            <p>“They grow much farther and faster, and the effect is pretty immediate,” Raman notes.</p><p>For a closer look at how neurons changed in response to the exercise-induced myokines, the team ran a genetic analysis, extracting RNA from the neurons to see whether the myokines induced any change in the expression of certain neuronal genes.</p><p>“We saw that many of the genes up-regulated in the exercise-stimulated neurons was not only related to neuron growth, but also neuron maturation, how well they talk to muscles and other nerves, and how mature the axons are,” Raman says. “Exercise seems to impact not just neuron growth but also how mature and well-functioning they are.”</p><p>The results suggest that biochemical effects of exercise can promote neuron growth. Then the group wondered: Could exercise’s purely physical impacts have a similar benefit?</p><p>“Neurons are physically attached to muscles, so they are also stretching and moving with the muscle,” Raman says. “We also wanted to see, even in the absence of biochemical cues from muscle, could we stretch the neurons back and forth, mimicking the mechanical forces (of exercise), and could that have an impact on growth as well?”</p><p>To answer this, the researchers grew a different set of motor neurons on a gel mat that they embedded with tiny magnets. They then used an external magnet to jiggle the mat — and the neurons — back and forth. In this way, they “exercised” the neurons, for 30 minutes a day. To their surprise, they found that this mechanical exercise stimulated the neurons to grow just as much as the myokine-induced neurons, growing significantly farther than neurons that received no form of exercise.</p><p>“That’s a good sign because it tells us both biochemical and physical effects of exercise are equally important,” Raman says.</p><p>Now that the group has shown that exercising muscle can promote nerve growth at the cellular level, they plan to study how targeted muscle stimulation can be used to grow and heal damaged nerves, and restore mobility for people who are living with a neurodegenerative disease such as ALS.</p><p>“This is just our first step toward understanding and controlling exercise as medicine,” Raman says.&nbsp;</p>

  </p>
  <p>
   One way to understand communication is to view it as a people process rather than a language process. If one is to make fundamental improvement in communication, one must make changes in interpersonal relationships. One possible type of alteration—and the one with which this paper is concerned—is that of reducing the degree of defensiveness.
  </p>
  <p>
   Definition and Significance
  </p>
  <p>
   Defensive behavior is defined as that behavior which occurs when an individual perceives threat or anticipates threat in the group. The person who behaves defensively, even though he or she also gives some attention to the common task, devotes an appreciable portion of energy to defending himself or herself. Besides talking about the topic, he thinks about how he appears to others, how he may be seen more favorably, how he may win, dominate, impress or escape punishment, and/or how he may avoid or mitigate a perceived attack.
  </p>
  <p>
   Such inner feelings and outward acts tend to create similarly defensive postures in others; and, if unchecked, the ensuing circular response becomes increasingly destructive. Defensive behavior, in short, engenders defensive listening, and this in turn produces postural, facial and verbal cues which raise the defense level of the original communicator.
  </p>
  <p>
   Defense arousal prevents the listener from concentrating upon the message. Not only do defensive communicators send off multiple value, motive and affect cues, but also defensive recipients distort what they receive. As a person becomes more and more defensive, he or she becomes less and less able to perceive accurately the motives, the values and the emotions of the sender. The writer's analysis of tape recorded discussions revealed that increases in defensive behavior were correlated positively with losses in efficiency in communication.(2)
  </p>
  <p>
   The converse, moreover, also is true. The more "supportive" or defense-reductive the climate, the less the receiver reads into the communication distorted loadings which arise from projections of his own anxieties, motives and concerns. As defenses are reduced, the receivers become better able to concentrate upon the structure, the content and the cognitive meanings of the message.
  </p>
  <p>
   Categories of Defensive and Supportive Communications
  </p>
  <p>
   In working over an eight-year period with recordings of discussions occurring in varied settings, the writer developed the six pairs of defensive and supportive categories presented in Table 1. Behavior which a listener perceives as possessing any of the characteristics listed in the left-hand column arouses defensiveness, whereas that which he interprets as having any of the qualities designated as supportive reduces defensive feelings. The degree to which these reactions occur depends upon the person's level of defensiveness and upon the general climate in the group at the time.(3)
  </p>
  <p>
   Evaluation and Description
  </p>
  <p>
   Speech or other behavior which appears evaluative increases defensiveness. If by expression, manner of speech, tone of voice or verbal content the sender seems to be evaluating or judging the listener, the receiver goes on guard. Of course, other factors may inhibit the reaction. If the listener thought that the speaker regarded him as an equal and was being open and spontaneous, for example, the evaluativeness in a message would be neutralized and perhaps not even perceived. This same principle applies equally to the other five categories of potentially defense-producing climates. These six sets are interactive.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because our attitudes toward other persons are frequently, and often necessarily, evaluative, expressions which the defensive person will regard as nonjudgmental are hard to frame. Even the simplest question usually conveys the answer that the sender wishes or implies the response that would fit into his or her value system. A mother, for example, immediately following an earth tremor that shook the house, sought for her small son with the question, "Bobby, where are you?" The timid and plaintive "Mommy, I didn't do it" indicated how Bobby's chronic mild defensiveness predisposed him to react with a projection of his own guilt and in the context of his chronic assumption that questions are full of accusation.

  <p>
   Anyone who has attempted to train professionals to use information-seeking speech with neutral affect appreciates how difficult it is to teach a person to say even the simple "who did that?" without being seen as accusing. Speech is so frequently judgmental that there is a reality base for the defensive interpretations which are so common.
  </p>
  <p>
   When insecure, group members are particularly likely to place blame, to see others as fitting into categories of good or bad, to make moral judgments of their colleagues and to question the value, motive and affect loadings of the speech which they hear. Since value loadings imply a judgment of others, a belief that the standards of the speaker differ from his or her own causes the listener to become defensive.
  </p>
  <p>
   Descriptive speech, in contrast to that which is evaluative, tends to arouse a minimum of uneasiness. Speech acts which the listener perceives as genuine requests for information or as material with neutral loadings is descriptive. Specifically, presentation of feelings, events, perceptions or processes which do not ask or imply that the receiver change behavior or attitude are minimally defense producing. The difficulty in avoiding overtone is illustrated by the problems of news reporters in writing stories about unions, Communists, Blacks and religious activities without tipping off the "party" line of the newspaper. One can often tell from the opening words in a news article which side the newspaper's editorial policy favors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Control and Problem Orientation
  </p>
  <p>
   Speech which is used to control the listener evokes resistance. In most of our social intercourse, someone is trying to do something to someone else—to change an attitude, to influence behavior, or to restrict the field of activity. The degree to which attempts to control produce defensiveness depends upon the openness of the effort, for a suspicion that hidden motives exist heightens resistance. For this reason, attempts of nondirective therapists and progressive educators to refrain from imposing a set of values, a point of view or a problem solution upon the receivers meet with many barriers. Since the norm is control, noncontrollers must earn the perceptions that their efforts have no hidden motives. A bombardment of persuasive "messages" in the fields of politics, education, special causes, advertising, religion, medicine, industrial relations and guidance has bred cynical and paranoid responses in listeners.
  </p>
  <p>
   Implicit in all attempts to alter another person is the assumption by the change agent that the person to be altered is inadequate. That the speaker secretly views the listener as ignorant, unable to make his or her own decisions, uninformed, immature, unwise, or possessed of wrong or inadequate attitudes is a subconscious perception which gives the latter a valid base for defensive reactions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Strategy and Spontaneity
  </p>
  <p>
   When the sender is perceived as engaged in a stratagem involving ambiguous and multiple motivations, the receiver becomes defensive. No one wishes to be a guinea pig, a role player, or an impressed actor, and no one likes to be the victim of some hidden motivation. That which is concealed, also, may appear larger than it really is with the degree of defensiveness of the listener determining the perceived size of the element. The intense reaction of the reading audience to the material in The Hidden Persuaders indicates the prevalence of defensive reactions to multiple motivations behind strategy. Group members who are seen as "taking a role" as feigning emotion, as toying with their colleagues, as withholding information or as having special sources of data are especially resented. One participant once complained that another was "using a listening technique" on him!
  </p>
  <p>
   A large part of the adverse reaction to much of the so-called human relations training is a feeling against what are perceived as gimmicks and tricks to fool or to "involve" people, to make a person think he or she is making their own decision, or to make the listener feel that the sender is genuinely interested in him or her as a person. Particularly violent reactions occur when it appears that someone is trying to make a stratagem appear spontaneous. One person reported a boss who incurred resentment by habitually using the gimmick of "spontaneously" looking at his watch and saying "my gosh, look at the time—I must run to an appointment." The belief was that the boss would create less irritation by honestly asking to be excused.
  </p>
  <p>
   The aversion to deceit may account for one's resistance to politicians who are suspected of behind-the-scenes planning to get one's vote, to psychologists whose listening apparently is motivated by more than the manifest or content-level interest in one's behavior, or the sophisticated, smooth, or clever person whose one-upmanship is marked with guile. In training groups the role-flexible person frequently is resented because his or her changes in behavior are perceived as strategic maneuvers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In contrast, behavior that appears to be spontaneous and free of deception is defense reductive. If the communicator is seen as having a clean id, as having uncomplicated motivations, as being straightforward and honest, as behaving spontaneously in response to the situation, he or she is likely to arouse minimal defensiveness.
  </p>
  <p>
   Neutrality and Empathy
  </p>
  <p>
   When neutrality in speech appears to the listener to indicate a lack of concern for his welfare, he becomes defensive. Group members usually desire to be perceived as valued persons, as individuals with special worth, and as objects of concern and affection. The clinical, detached, person-is-an-object-study attitude on the part of many psychologist-trainers is resented by group members. Speech with low affect that communicates little warmth or caring is in such contrast with the affect-laden speech in social situations that it sometimes communicates rejection.
  </p>
  <p>
   Communication that conveys empathy for the feelings and respect for the worth of the listener, however, is particularly supportive and defense reductive. Reassurance results when a message indicates that the speaker identifies himself or herself with the listener's problems, shares her feelings, and accepts her emotional reactions at face value. Abortive efforts to deny the legitimacy of the receiver's emotions by assuring the receiver that she need not feel badly, that she should not feel rejected, or that she is overly anxious, although often intended as support giving, may impress the listener as lack of acceptance. The combination of understanding and empathizing with the other person's emotions with no accompanying effort to change him or her is supportive at a high level.
  </p>
  <p>
   The importance of gestural behavior cues in communicating empathy should be mentioned. Apparently spontaneous facial and bodily evidences of concern are often interpreted as especially valid evidence of deep-level acceptance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Superiority and Equality
  </p>
  <p>
   When a person communicates to another that he or she feels superior in position, power, wealth, intellectual ability, physical characteristics, or other ways, she or he arouses defensiveness. Here, as with other sources of disturbance, whatever arouses feelings of inadequacy causes the listener to center upon the affect loading of the statement rather than upon the cognitive elements. The receiver then reacts by not hearing the message, by forgetting it, by competing with the sender, or by becoming jealous of him or her.
  </p>
  <p>
   The person who is perceived as feeling superior communicates that he or she is not willing to enter into a shared problem-solving relationship, that he or she probably does not desire feedback, that he or she does not require help, and/or that he or she will be likely to try to reduce the power, the status, or the worth of the receiver.
  </p>
  <p>
   Many ways exist for creating the atmosphere that the sender feels himself or herself equal to the listener. Defenses are reduced when one perceives the sender as being willing to enter into participative planning with mutual trust and respect. Differences in talent, ability, worth, appearance, status and power often exist, but the low defense communicator seems to attach little importance to these distinctions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Certainty and Provisionalism
  </p>
  <p>
   The effects of dogmatism in producing defensiveness are well known. Those who seem to know the answers, to require no additional data, and to regard themselves as teachers rather than as co-workers tend to put others on guard. Moreover, in the writer's experiment, listeners often
  </p>
  <p>
   perceived manifest expressions of certainty as connoting inward feelings of inferiority. They saw the dogmatic individual as needing to be right, as wanting to win an argument rather than solve a problem and as seeing his or her ideas as truths to be defended. This kind of behavior often was associated with acts which others regarded as attempts to exercise control. People who were right seemed to have low tolerance for members who were "wrong"—i.e., who did not agree with the sender.
  </p>
  <p>
   One reduces the defensiveness of the listener when one communicates that one is willing to experiment with one's own behavior, attitudes and ideas. The person who appears to be taking provisional attitudes, to be investigating issues rather than taking sides on them, to be problem solving rather than doubting, and to be willing to experiment and explore tends to communicate that the listener may have some control over the shared quest or the investigation of the ideas. If a person is genuinely searching for information and data, he or she does not resent help or company along the way.
  </p>
  <p>
   Conclusion
  </p>
  <p>
   The implications of the above material for the parent, the teacher, the manager, the administrator, or the therapist are fairly obvious. Arousing defensiveness interferes with communication and thus makes it difficult—and sometimes impossible—for anyone to convey ideas clearly and to move effectively toward the solution of therapeutic, educational, or managerial problems.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p><em>Note: This post is based on a talk that I was supposed to give at a local FOSS United meetup but couldn't due to health issues.</em></p>
<h3>Prologue</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"... This puts the future squarely in the hands of those who know computers not for what they are, but for everything they have the potential to be."</p>
<p>"Computers aren't the thing, they are the thing that gets us to the thing"</p>
<p>-- Halt and Catch Fire, S01E01, 2014.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This conversation between two protagonists in HCF describes two types of people in computing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those interested in solving real-world problems using computers.</li>
<li>Those interested in solving the meta-problem, e.g. building computers.</li>
</ol>
<p>But this categorization isn't exactly black and white.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When people who can’t think logically design large systems, those systems
become incomprehensible. And we start thinking of them as biological systems.
And since biological systems are too complex to understand, it seems
perfectly natural that computer programs should be too complex to understand.</p>
<p>We should not accept this. If we don’t, then the future of computing will
belong to biology, not logic. <strong>We will continue having to use computer
programs that we don’t understand, and trying to coax them to do what we
want.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Instead of a sensible world of computing, we will live in a world of homeopathy and faith healing.</strong></p>
<p>-- Leslie Lamport, "The Future of Computing: Logic or Biology", 2003.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote, out of context might seem like Leslie Lamport doesn't respect biologists. That isn't the intention at all. He's pointing out that computing, unlike biology, is entirely constructed by us; given enough motivation and competence one can understand computing down to the last bit flip that happens under the hood. Biology on the other hand has evolved over millions of years and we have no choice but to decipher it by painstakingly observing the natural world.</p>
<p>Engineers working on real problems need to understand meta-problem and engineers solving the meta-problem need to understand the real-world implications of their solutions. Nothing much happens in isolation.</p>
<p>Now, with these two seemingly unrelated quotes out of the way. The main topic for this blog is a paper that describes what is now more commonly known as "von Neumann Architecture". This architecture is used in almost every computing device on earth, so from today's perspective, the problem they solved was about as meta as it gets.</p>
<p>I will mainly use note-worthy snippets from the original paper and let the paper speak for itself.</p>
<h3>The Paper</h3>
<blockquote>
<h4>Preliminary Discussion of the Logical Design of an Electronic Computing Instrument</h4>
<h5>Arthur W. Burks, Herman H. Goldstine, and John von Neumann</h5>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait, why is it called "von Neumann" architecture when he is the third author on the paper? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von Neumann</a> was quite a big figure in this era. Around a year before this report was published, one of the draft reports was "leaked" by Herman Goldstine.</p>
<p>That leaked draft written by von Neumann was supposed to be internal. So while this work was supposed to be the product of many individuals working on the project, von Neumann's name stuck around.</p>
<p>This leak also resulted in the work becoming unpatentable. It's hard to say with certainty now, but this leak very well could've accelerated progress in computing by one or two decades.</p>

<h3>"Bit Flips"</h3>
<p>Novel research can be understood in terms of bit flips. A "Bit Flip" is a change in a certain assumption from the status quo (<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs197/lectures/cs197-02-research-contribution.pdf">reference</a>).</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>The status quo assumes that network behavior has to be statically defined in hardware.</li>
<li>It doesn't <em>have</em> to be that way, we can build software-defined networking to make networks more flexible.</li>
</ul>
<p>So while reading any seminal paper, you'll surely find a "bit flip". The bigger the assumption that was flipped, the bigger the impact of the paper.</p>
<p>This paper has several such bit flips but I'll focus on two here to begin with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.2. It is evident that the machine must be capable of storing in some manner not only the digital
information needed in a given computation such as boundary values, tables of functions (such as the
equation of state of a fluid) and also the intermediate results of the computation (which may be wanted for
varying length) of time), but also the instructions which govern the actual routine to be performed on the
numerical data. In a special-purpose machine these instructions are an integral part of the device and
constitute a part of its design structure. For an <strong>all-purpose machine</strong> it must be possible to instruct the device
to carry out any computation that can be formulated in numerical terms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The team working on this project had previously successfully built <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC">ENIAC</a>. It was designed for a singular purpose: artillery table calculations. Their next machine was going to be a general-purpose computer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.3. Conceptually we have discussed above two different forms of memory: <strong>storage of numbers and storage
of orders</strong>. If, however, the orders to the machine are reduced to a numerical code and if the machine can in
some fashion distinguish a number from an order, the memory organ can be used to store both numbers and
orders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Computers before this paper had two different types of memory: "orders" and "numbers".
As computers have moved past just being numerical calculation machines, we now call them "instructions" and "data".</p>
<p>Storing programs and data in reprogrammable memory meant that computers could now be reprogrammed without physically rewiring the computer.</p>
<h3>Components</h3>
<p>We now take a look at the description of components that were designed for the first general-purpose computer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.4. If the memory for orders is merely a storage organ there must exist an organ which can automatically
<strong>execute the orders</strong> stored in the memory. We shall call this organ the Control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The terminology of calling computer parts "organs" is gone now, but the "Control" here describes what we now commonly refer to as CPU.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.5. Inasmuch as the device is to be a computing machine there must be an <strong>arithmetic organ</strong> in it which can
perform certain of the elementary arithmetic operations. There will be, therefore, a unit capable of adding,
subtracting, multiplying and dividing. It will be seen in 6.6 below that it can also perform additional
operations that occur quite frequently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The arithmetic organ is modern-day ALU, the part inside the processor that is capable of doing arithmetic operations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, the inner economy of the arithmetic unit is determined by a <strong>compromise</strong> between the
desire for speed of operation—a non-elementary operation will generally take a long time to perform since
it is constituted of a series of orders given by the control—and the desire for simplicity, or cheapness, of the
machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They recognize before even building the first general-purpose computers, one of the biggest debates in computing hardware: RISC vs. CISC.</p>
<p>Should we build simple and cheap components that require multiple instructions to solve the problem? Or complex and costly components that require fewer instructions.
Today it seems we are settling on a CISC-like interface with RISC-like internal implementation. Popular RISC architecture like ARM and CISC architecture like x86 both have fairly complex instruction sets but complex instructions are split into smaller <a href="https://uops.info/table.html">"micro-ops"</a> which is what the processor actually ends up executing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To summarize, transfers into the memory will be of two sorts: Total substitutions, whereby the quantity
previously stored is cleared out and replaced by a new number. Partial substitutions in which that part of an
order containing a memory location-number—we assume the various positions in the memory are
enumerated serially by <strong>memory location-numbers</strong> is replaced by a new memory location-number.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While describing operations on memory they describe what feels like pointers, but what we call pointers now is almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)#History">two decades away in the future</a>. Instead of referring to memory location as a pointer, their design modifies part of instruction itself to implement "pointer" like behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3.4. It is clear that one must be able to get numbers from any part of the memory at any time. The treatment
in the case of orders can, however, be more methodical since one can at least partially arrange the control
instructions in a linear sequence. Consequently the control will be so constructed that it will normally
proceed from place n in the memory to place <strong>(n + 1) for its next instruction.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instructions don't need to be scattered in memory, they can be loaded in a sequential manner and hence control moves from one instruction to the next. This behavior is now commonly associated with "Program Counter".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3.5. The utility of an automatic computer lies in the possibility of using a given sequence of instructions
repeatedly, the number of times it is iterated being either preassigned or dependent upon the results of the
computation. When the iteration is completed a different sequence of orders is to be followed, so we must,
in most cases, give two parallel trains of orders preceded by an instruction as to which routine is to be
followed. This choice can be made to depend upon the sign of a number (zero being reckoned as plus for
machine purposes). Consequently, we introduce an order (the <strong>conditional transfer order</strong>) which will,
depending on the sign of a given number, cause the proper one of two routines to be executed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sequential code itself can not implement repeated computations. So they came up with jump instructions which based on certain conditions can make a jump in control flow. This can be used to implement conditional branching and looping.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4. The Memory Organ</p>
<p>4.1. Ideally one would desire an indefinitely large memory capacity such that any particular aggregate of 40
<strong>binary digits</strong>, or word, would be immediately available—i.e. in a time which is somewhat or
considerably shorter than the operation time of a fast electronic multiplier. This may be assumed to be
practical at the level of about 100 μsec. Hence the availability time for a word in the memory should be 5 to 50
μsec. It is equally desirable that words may be replaced with new words at about the same rate. It does
not seem possible physically to achieve such a capacity. We are therefore forced to recognize the possibility
of constructing a <strong>hierarchy of memories</strong>, each of which has greater capacity than the preceding but which is
less quickly accessible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's <em>odd</em>, their machine has a word size of "40 binary digits". The term "bit" was not mainstream yet, that happened a few years later when Claude Shannon published his work that created the field of Information theory.</p>
<p>They are talking about a memory latency of about 100 microseconds. Today memory latency can range from less than 1 nanosecond (L1 hit) to 100s of nanoseconds  (L3 miss). So while it has improved by at least 3 orders of magnitude since inception, it still pales in comparison to speedup in other components. This is now known as the "Memory Wall".</p>
<p>The necessity of memory hierarchy using a series of caches, DRAM, and disk that we know today was envisioned at the birth of general-purpose computers. However, the memory hierarchy mentioned here is unlikely to be the transparent CPU caches that we know today. Instead, the movement of data between faster memory and storage was left to "planners" or programmers. Modern caching comes into the picture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache#History">c. 1960s.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most common forms of storage in electrical circuits are the flip-flop or trigger circuit, the gas tube,
and the electro-mechanical relay. To achieve a memory of n words would, of course, require about 40n such
elements, exclusive of the switching elements. We saw earlier that a fast memory of several
thousand words is not at all unreasonable for an all-purpose instrument. Hence, about <strong>10^5 flip-flops</strong> or
analogous elements would be required! This would, of course, be <strong>entirely impractical.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's hilarious to read this comment from almost eight decades ago about how 10^5 flip-flops are entirely impractical. 10^5 flip-flops is about 12.2KiB of memory. The browser tab you're using to read this alone is likely consuming three orders of magnitude more in RAM.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4.5. Inasmuch as a great many highly important classes of problems require a far greater total memory than
2^12 words, we now consider the next stage in our storage hierarchy. Although the solution of partial
differential equations frequently involves the manipulation of many thousands of words, these data are
generally required only in blocks which are well within the 2^12 capacity of the electronic memory. Our
second form of storage must therefore be a medium which feeds these blocks of words to the electronic
memory. It should be controlled by the control of the computer and is thus an integral part of the system,
not requiring human intervention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even today, the "working set" of programs in execution is often much smaller than the size of complete data or even the complete program. By using cheap secondary storage which can load data into memory when required, the storage needs of the system can be met. This concept is still in use today as a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_(computer_programming)">swapping</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_paging">demand paging</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The medium should be capable of remembering very large numbers of data at a much
smaller price than electronic devices. It must be fast enough so that, even when it has to be used frequently
in a problem, a large percentage of the total solution time is not spent in getting data into and out of this
medium and achieving the desired positioning on it. If this condition is not reasonably well met, <strong>the
advantages of the high electronic speeds of the machine will be largely lost.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paragraph describes the I/O bottleneck and we still deal with this even today, maybe in different ways. CPUs have gotten significantly faster but memory and disk latency have not improved as much. This means that the throughput of many programs is I/O bound or memory bound.</p>
<h3>Number System</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>5.2. In a discussion of the arithmetical organs of a computing machine one is naturally led to a consideration
of the number system to be adopted. In spite of the longstanding tradition of building digital machines in the
decimal system, <strong>we feel strongly in favor of the binary system for our device</strong>. Our fundamental unit of
memory is naturally adapted to the binary system since we do not attempt to measure gradations of charge
at a particular point in the Selectron but are content to distinguish two states. The flip-flop again is truly a
binary device. On magnetic wires or tapes and in acoustic delay line memories one is also content to
recognize the presence or absence of a pulse or (if a carrier frequency is used) of a pulse train, or of the sign
of a pulse.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Hence if one contemplates using a decimal system with either the iconoscope or
delay-line memory one is forced into a binary coding of the decimal system—each decimal digit being
represented by at least a tetrad of binary digits. Thus an accuracy of ten decimal digits requires at least 40
binary digits. In a true binary representation of numbers, however, about 33 digits suffice to achieve a
precision of 1010. The use of the binary system is therefore somewhat more economical of equipment than is
the decimal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That explains the <em>odd</em> choice for 40-bit word size.</p>
<p>Their previous machine ENIAC was a base-10 machine. Even though binary computers seem ubiquitous today, that wasn't the case in the 1940s. When we look at it through the lens of the smallest parts of the computer, it makes sense that the system should be binary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5.3. Several of the digital computers being built or planned in this country and England are to contain a so-
called <strong>“floating decimal point”</strong>. This is a mechanism for expressing each word as a characteristic and a
mantissa—e.g. 123.45 would be carried in the machine as (0.12345, 03), where the 3 is the exponent of 10
associated with the number. There appear to be two major purposes in a “floating” decimal point system,
both of which arise from the fact that the number of digits in a word is a constant, fixed by design
considerations for each particular machine. The first of these purposes is to retain in a sum or product as
many significant digits as possible and the second of these is to free the human operator from the burden of
estimating and inserting into a problem <strong>"scale factors"</strong>—multiplicative constants which serve to keep
numbers within the limits of the machine</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today we use binary instead of decimal for storing mantissa and exponent. The standard for floating point numbers IEEE 754 was formalized in 1985 and FPUs don't become mainstream in PCs until c. 2000s. It seems rather odd because scientific computing heavily relies on "real numbers" for computations which are tricky to do with just integers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is, of course, no denying the fact that human time is consumed in arranging for the introduction of
suitable scale factors. We only argue that the time so consumed is a very small percentage of the total time
we will spend in preparing an interesting problem for our machine. The first <strong>advantage of the floating point
is, we feel, somewhat illusory</strong>. In order to have such a floating point one must waste memory capacity which
could otherwise be used for carrying more digits per word. It would therefore seem to us not at all clear
whether the modest advantages of a floating binary point offset the loss of memory capacity and the
increased complexity of the arithmetic and control circuits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Von Neumann wasn't entirely sold on why we might need floating-point numbers. He was quite vocal in his critique of floating-point numbers. For better or worse, floating point is now a ubiquitous number type in most systems.</p>
<p>In another paper, we find Von Neumann's even shaper critique of floating-point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Besides, the floating binary point represents an effort to render a thorough
mathematical understanding of at least part of the problem unnecessary, and
we feel that this is a step in a doubtful direction."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There may have been some truth to this argument. Personally, I've spent days trying to correctly <a href="https://github.com/frappe/frappe/pull/20258">round off floating point numbers</a>. Read more about <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html">floating point numbers here</a>.</p>
<p>Unrelated: Ever wondered why Linux systems calls do not provide seconds as a floating point number but instead provide seconds <code>mtim.tv_sec</code> and nanoseconds part <code>mtim.tv_nsec</code> separately? OS like Linux still use integers to approximate real numbers using scale factors for various reasons and the <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/core-api/floating-point.html">use of floating-point is largely prohibited in the kernel</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These desiderata must, however, be considered in conjunction with some further comments.
Specifically: (a) x and y themselves are likely to be the results of similar round-offs, directly or indirectly
inherent, i.e. x and y themselves should be viewed as unbiased n-digit approximations of “true” x′ and y′
values; (b) by talking of “variances” and “means” we are introducing statistical concepts. Now the
approximations which we are here considering are not really of a statistical nature, but are due to the
peculiarities (from our point of view, inadequacies) of arithmetic and of digital representation, and are
therefore actually rigorously and uniquely determined. It seems, however, in the present state of
mathematical science, rather <strong>hopeless to try to deal with these matters rigorously</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine mathematical genius from 20th century suggesting it's hopeless to deal with round-off errors from successive rounding operations. This is <em>truly</em> a hard problem to solve, just imagine a basic scenario like storing an order for multiple items.</p>

<p>If you have to round off to 2 digits, where should you round these numbers off? Rates? Line total? Grand total?</p>
<ul>
<li>If you round off the rate then rounding error will grow with quantity, so it's usually out of the picture.</li>
<li>Rounded line total and the ground total can always be off by up to 1 cent. Is it biased? For which side?</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no "correct" answer. You just have to pick one method and stick with it. This example doesn't even consider the intricacies of floating-point numbers which can not represent certain real numbers so it has additional representation error.</p>
<p>If you think fixed-precision numbers can save you somehow, boy do I have some news for you.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; # This is Python REPL
&gt;&gt;&gt; from decimal import Decimal
&gt;&gt;&gt; Decimal("1") / Decimal("3") * Decimal("3") == Decimal("1")
False
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Consequently,
multiplication and division must unavoidably be replaced by the machine by two different operations which
must produce n-digits under all conditions, and which, subject to this limitation, should lie as close as
possible to the results of the true multiplication and division. One might call them pseudo-multiplication
and pseudo-division; however, the accepted nomenclature terms them as multiplication and division with
round-off. (We are now creating the impression that addition and subtraction are entirely free of such
shortcomings. This is only true inasmuch as they do not create new digits to the right, as multiplication and
division do. However, they can create new digits to the left, i.e. cause the numbers to “grow out of range”.
This complication, which is, of course, well known, is normally met by the planner, by mathematical
arrangements and estimates to keep the numbers <strong>"within range"</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paragraph describes what we now refer to as "overflow" errors. Trying to keep numbers within range while doing arithmetic operations is possibly another major source of bugs even today. Leaving this problem entirely to "planners" doesn't always work out, humans have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_flight_V88">lost a rocket</a> due to overflow error.</p>
<h3>Debugging</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>4.8. There is another highly important part of the input-output which we merely mention at this time,
namely, some mechanism for <strong>viewing graphically the results of a given computation</strong>. This can, of course, be
achieved by a Selectron-like tube which causes its screen to fluoresce when data are put on it by an electron
beam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Debuggability is an essential property of complex systems. Debugging isn't just a process of removing faults from a system, it's how you truly understand what is going on under the hood, which may or may not match your understanding. e.g. When I use <code>strace</code> to understand what a program is doing, I am not always looking for any faults, sometimes it's just a process of understanding what's going on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a problem is run for the first time, so that it requires special
care, or when an error is known to be present, and has to be located—only then will it be necessary as a
rule, to use both machines in parallel. Thus they can be used as separate machines most of the time. The
essential feature of such a method of checking lies in the fact that it checks the computation at every point
(and hence detects transient errors as well as steady-state ones) and <strong>stops the machine when the error occurs
so that the process of localizing the fault is greatly simplified</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Interesting</em>. They use two machines to see if they always produce the same outcomes at every stage. We can find similar systems that require high redundancy and reliability, e.g. nuclear reactors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Merlin#Engine_control">computers in space</a>, and autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>Secondly, they pause the execution so a planner can inspect the error. Sounds familiar?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The method of localizing errors, either with or without a duplicate machine, needs further discussion. It
is planned to design all the circuits (including those of the control) of the computer so that if the clock is
stopped between pulses the computer will retain all its information in flip-flops so that the computation may
proceed unaltered when the clock is started again. This principle has already demonstrated its usefulness in
the ENIAC. This makes it possible for the machine to compute with the clock operating at any speed below
a certain maximum, as long as the clock gives out pulses of constant shape regardless of the spacing
between pulses. In particular, the spacing between pulses may be made indefinitely large. The clock will be
provided with a mode of operation in which it will emit a single pulse whenever instructed to do so by the
operator. <strong>By means of this, the operator can cause the machine to go through an operation step by step</strong>,
checking the results by means of the indicating-lamps connected to the flip-flops.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is similar to modern-day debuggers which let you step through your program one instruction or one line at a time.</p>
<p>When the cycle time for writing and executing a new version of the program is high, trying out random hypotheses until it works was not a practical approach. Today, with modern hardware and fast iteration cycles we can get away with not even using debuggers for most bugs.</p>
<h3>Epilogue - Eight Decades Later</h3>
<p><img src="https://ankush.dev/assets/images/neumann.png" alt="von Neumann architecture diagram"></p>
<p>This is how von Neumann's architecture is taught in schools today. The famous Big-Oh notation is also based on a similar model of computer. However, after eight decades of evolution, the underlying hardware is completely different from this model.</p>
<p>There is immense pedagogical value in our simple block diagram of von Neumann architecture, but let's be real here, even the original implementation of von Neumann architecture is not that simple. Let's take a look at this block diagram of modern Zen 4 architecture.</p>
<p><img src="https://ankush.dev/assets/images/zen4.png" alt="Zen 4 Block Diagram"></p>
<p>Image from <a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/p/amds-zen-4-part-1-frontend-and-execution-engine">Chips and Cheese</a>.</p>
<p>In modern CPUs, <em>NOTHING</em> is straightforward.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instructions don't execute one at a time, 100s of instructions can be in flight at any given time.</li>
<li>There is <em>wild</em> speculative execution going on in every component where it's feasible:
<ul>
<li>Conditional branches are predicted using branch predictors long before they are actually evaluated.</li>
<li>Many (typically 2 to 8) independent instructions can execute in parallel, on a single core.</li>
<li>Stale memory values are used hoping they won't change, if they change CPU just rolls back the incorrect computation.</li>
<li>Your memory access patterns are predicted by multiple pre-fetchers who issue the next memory access before your code issues them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Memory accesses can vary from less than one nanosecond (L1 hit) to 300,000 nanoseconds (Page fault + load from SSD).</li>
<li>Hardware assists with virtual memory implementation using TLBs and paging.</li>
<li>There are vector units to do single operations on multiple data aka SIMD.</li>
<li>Oh, and there are possibly 100s of cores, all doing the same thing while trying to present a coherent view of the system.</li>
<li>Oh, and there can be more than 1 such chip on the same board in NUMA configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>*mindblown.gif*</p>
<p>While computer architects ensure that you always get the expected behavior as per specifications, they can't do the same to guarantee performance. One needs to understand all the underlying components to a reasonable degree to truly utilize the capabilities of modern hardware, otherwise, we're doomed to use compute clusters for <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/hotos15/hotos15-paper-mcsherry.pdf">problems that can be solved using a single laptop</a>. In the words of Paul Barham:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You can have a second computer once you've shown you know how to use the first one."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve been working professionally for the better part of a decade on web apps and, in that time, I’ve had to learn how to use a lot of different systems and tools.
During that education, I found that the official documentation typically proved to be the most helpful.</p>

<p>Except…Postgres.
It’s not because the official docs aren’t stellar (they are!)–they’re just <em>massive</em>.
For the current version (17 at the time of writing), if <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/files/documentation/pdf/17/postgresql-17-US.pdf">printed as a standard PDF on US letter-sized paper</a>, it’s 3,200 pages long.<sup id="fnref:a4_correction" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:a4_correction" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
It’s not something any junior engineer can just sit down and read start to finish.</p>

<p>So I want to try to catalog the bits that I wish someone had just told me before working with a Postgres database. 
Hopefully, this makes things easier for the next person going on a journey similar to mine.</p>

<p>Note that many of these things may also apply to other SQL database management systems (DBMSs) or other databases more generally,
but I’m not as familiar with others so I’m not sure what does and does not apply.</p>

<h2 id="normalize-your-data-unless-you-have-a-good-reason-not-to">Normalize your data unless you have a good reason not to</h2>

<p>Database normalization is the process of removing duplicate or redundant data from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema">database schema</a>.
For example, say you have a site where users can upload documents and users can subscribe to email notifications when folks view their documents.
If you have a <code>documents</code> table, you shouldn’t have a <code>user_email</code> column on said table:
When a user wants to change their email, you shouldn’t have to update the hundreds of rows for all the documents they’ve uploaded.
Instead, you can have each row in <code>documents</code> represent a row in another table (e.g. <code>users</code>) with a foreign key (e.g. <code>user_id</code>).</p>

<p>If you search for “database normalization” online, you’ll find a bunch of results about “1st normal form” and the like.
You definitely don’t need to know what each of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Normal_forms">“normal forms”</a> are,
but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Example_of_a_step-by-step_normalization">the general process</a> is good to be familiar with as it can lead you to a more maintainable database schema.</p>

<p>There are occasions when having redundant data (that is, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormalization">denormalizing your schema</a>) can make sense:
this is typically to make reading certain data faster so it doesn’t have to be recomputed every time it’s requested.
E.g. you have an application that manages employee shifts at a bakery.
A user might want to see how many hours they’ve worked so far this year.
To calculate that, you would need to do something like determine the duration of each of their shifts and then sum all of them together.
It might make sense to instead calculate this amount on a regular interval or whenever the number of hours worked changes.
This data can be denormalized within the Postgres database or outside of it (e.g. in a caching layer like Redis).
Note that there is almost always a cost to denormalized data,
whether that’s possible data inconsistency or increased write complexity.</p>

<h2 id="follow-all-the-advice-from-the-folks-that-make-postgres">Follow all the advice from the folks that make Postgres</h2>

<p>There’s a big list aptly titled <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This">“Don’t do this”</a> on the official Postgres wiki.
You may not understand all of the things listed.
That’s fine!
If you don’t understand, then you probably won’t make the mistake.
Some suggestions worth highlighting:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This#Text_storage">Just use the <code>text</code> type for all text storage</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This#Date.2FTime_storage">Just use the <code>timestampz</code>/<code>time with time zone</code> type for all timestamp storage</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This#Don.27t_use_upper_case_table_or_column_names">Name your tables in snake_case</a></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="saving-your-pinkies-you-dont-have-to-write-sql-in-all-caps">Saving your pinkies: you don’t have to write SQL in all caps</h3>

<p>In most documentation and tutorials, you’ll see SQL written like so:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>my_table</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>AND</span> <span>y</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>2</span> <span>LIMIT</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The case for SQL keywords does not matter.
That means the snippet above is the same as this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> <span>my_table</span> <span>where</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>and</span> <span>y</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>2</span> <span>limit</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>or this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> <span>my_table</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>and</span> <span>y</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>2</span> <span>LIMIT</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>As far as I know, this is not specific to Postgres.
Your pinkies will thank you.</p>

<h3 id="null-is-weird">
<code>NULL</code> is weird</h3>

<p>You’re probably familiar with <code>null</code> or <code>nil</code> values from other programming languages.
SQL’s <code>NULL</code> is not like that.
<code>NULL</code> is really more accurately an “unknown”.
E.g. <code>NULL = NULL</code> returns <code>NULL</code> (because it’s unknown if one unknown equals another unknown!)
This is true for almost any operator, not just <code>=</code>(we’ll go through some of the exceptions in a moment):
if one side of the comparison is <code>NULL</code>, the result will be <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>There are a few operators that you can use to compare against <code>NULL</code> which don’t result in <code>NULL</code>:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Operation</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>x IS NULL</code></td>
      <td>returns <code>true</code> if <code>x</code> evaluates to <code>NULL</code>, <code>false</code> otherwise</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>x IS NOT NULL</code></td>
      <td>returns <code>true</code> if <code>x</code> does not evaluate to <code>NULL</code>, <code>false</code> otherwise</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>x IS NOT DISTINCT FROM y</code></td>
      <td>the same as <code>x = y</code> but <code>NULL</code> is treated as a normal value</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>x IS DISTINCT FROM y</code></td>
      <td>the same as <code>x != y</code>/<code>x &lt;&gt; y</code> but <code>NULL</code> is treated as a normal value</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><code>WHERE</code> clauses only match if the condition evaluates to <code>true</code>.
This means that a query like <code>SELECT * FROM users WHERE title != 'manager'</code> won’t return rows where <code>title</code> is <code>NULL</code> because <code>NULL != 'manager'</code> is <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>Another useful function when attempting to wrangle <code>NULL</code> is <code>COALESCE</code>:
<code>COALESCE</code> will take any number of arguments and return the first one that is not <code>NULL</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>COALESCE</span><span>(</span><span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span>
<span>COALESCE</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>9</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>COALESCE</span><span>(</span><span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>)</span> <span>IS</span> <span>NULL</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="you-can-make-psql-more-useful">You can make <code>psql</code> more useful</h2>

<h3 id="fix-your-unreadable-output">Fix your unreadable output</h3>
<p>Have you ever done a query on a table with many columns or long values in those columns and the output is basically unreadable?
It’s probably because you don’t have the pager enabled.
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_pager">terminal pager</a> allows you to view a file (or table, in the case of <code>psql</code>) of text by scrolling a viewport around some larger canvas.
Without a pager, it just dumps the text in your terminal, wrapping to a new line wherever it runs out of space.</p>

<p><code>less</code> is a decent pager available on any Unix-like system.
You can set it as your pager by setting the environment variable in your <code>~/.bashrc</code>/<code>~/.zshrc</code>/etc.:</p>
<div><pre><code><span># Use the `-S` option so it truncates long lines for scrolling instead of wrapping them</span>
<span>export </span><span>PAGER</span><span>=</span><span>'less -S'</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Sometimes, even viewing things as a properly formatted table isn’t particularly useful, especially with tables with <em>many</em> columns.
For this, you can switch to “expanded” mode with <code>\pset expanded</code> (or the shortcut <code>\x</code>) in your <code>psql</code> session.
If you want to have this as the default, you can add a file called <code>.psqlrc</code> to your home directory (i.e. <code>~/.psqlrc</code>) and add <code>\x</code> to it.
Any time you start up a <code>psql</code> session, it’ll run all the commands in that file first.</p>

<h3 id="clarify-ambiguous-nulls">Clarify ambiguous nulls</h3>

<p>It’s <em>very</em> important to know when a value is <code>NULL</code> in an output, but the default settings don’t make that particularly clear.
You can give <code>psql</code> a string to output when it’s referring to <code>NULL</code>.
I have it set to <code>[NULL]</code> by running</p>
<pre><code>\pset null '[NULL]'
</code></pre>
<p>Any Unicode string is fine!
It’s a bit past spooky season, but you can be like my friend <a href="https://stevenharman.net/">Steven Harman</a> and set it to “👻”.</p>

<p>Once again, if you want to have this as the default, you can add a file called <code>.psqlrc</code> to your home directory (i.e. <code>~/.psqlrc</code>) and add <code>\pset null '[NULL]'</code> to it.
Any time you start up a <code>psql</code> session, it’ll run all the commands in that file first.</p>

<h3 id="use-auto-completion">Use auto-completion</h3>

<p><code>psql</code>, like many interactive consoles, will allow for auto-completion.
It helps that SQL is a fairly rigid and fairly structured language.
You can just start typing most keywords or table names and hit <kbd>Tab</kbd> and let <code>psql</code> fill out the rest:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>-- start typing "SEL"</span>
<span>SEL</span>
<span>-- ^ hit `Tab`</span>
<span>SELECT</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="lean-on-backslash-shortcuts">Lean on backslash shortcuts</h3>

<p>There are a whole bunch of useful shortcut commands in <code>psql</code> for looking up stuff, command line editing, and more.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Command</th>
      <th>What it does</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>\?</code></td>
      <td>List all of the shortcuts</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>\d</code></td>
      <td>Shows list of relations (tables and sequences) as well as said relation’s owner</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>\d+</code></td>
      <td>Same as <code>\d</code> but also includes the size and some other metadata</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>\d table_name</code></td>
      <td>Shows the schema of a table (list of columns, including said column’s type, nullability, and default) as well as any indexes or foreign key constraints on said table</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>\e</code></td>
      <td>Opens your default editor (set as the <code>$EDITOR</code> environment variable) to edit your query there</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>\h SQL_KEYWORD</code></td>
      <td>Get syntax and link to docs for <code>SQL_KEYWORD</code>
</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>There are a ton of these and the table above only scratches the surface.</p>

<h3 id="copy-to-a-csv">Copy to a CSV</h3>

<p>Sometimes, you just want to share the output of a command with someone who wants to put it in Excel or something.
In Postgres, it’s actually really easy to copy the output of any query to a CSV on your local machine<sup id="fnref:copy_permissions" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:copy_permissions" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>

<pre><code>\copy (select * from some_table) to 'my_file.csv' CSV
</code></pre>
<p>If you want it to include an initial line with all the column names, you can add the <code>HEADER</code> option:</p>
<pre><code>\copy (select * from some_table) to 'my_file.csv' CSV HEADER
</code></pre>
<p>For way more information (including how to get it to do the reverse: insert rows from data in a CSV!), check out <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-META-COMMANDS-COPY">the docs on this command</a>.</p>

<h3 id="use-column-shorthands-and-aliases">Use column shorthands and aliases</h3>

<p>When doing a <code>SELECT</code> statement in <code>psql</code>, you can re-title each of the output columns to whatever you want (an “alias”) with the <code>AS</code> keyword:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>vendor</span><span>,</span> <span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>number_of_backpacks</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>backpacks</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>vendor</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>number_of_backpacks</span> <span>DESC</span><span>;</span> 
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will also rename the column in the output.</p>

<p>What’s more is that <code>GROUP BY</code> and <code>ORDER BY</code> have their own nice shorthand as well:
you can reference output columns by the number they appear after <code>SELECT</code>.
Therefore, you can write the previous query as</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>vendor</span><span>,</span> <span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>number_of_backpacks</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>backpacks</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>2</span> <span>DESC</span><span>;</span> 
</code></pre></div>

<p>While useful, don’t put this in any queries that you ship to production–your future self will thank you!</p>

<h2 id="its-possible-that-adding-an-index-will-do-nothing-particularly-if-its-misconfigured">It’s possible that adding an index will do nothing (particularly if it’s misconfigured)</h2>

<h3 id="what-is-an-index">What is an index?</h3>

<p>An index is a data structure intended to help with looking up data–giving Postgres the responsibility of maintaining a “shortcut directory” to a table’s rows by various fields.
By far the most common kind is a <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/cs/b-tree-data-structure">B-tree</a> index, which is a kind of search tree that work for both exact equality conditions (e.g. <code>WHERE a = 3</code>) as well as range conditions (e.g. <code>WHERE a &gt; 5</code>).</p>

<p>But you can’t tell Postgres to use a specific index.
It needs to predict (using statistics it maintains for each table) that it’ll be faster than just reading the table from top to bottom to find the relevant data
(known as a “sequential scan” or “seq. scan”–pronounced “seek scan”–for short).
You can see how Postgres is planning on executing a query by adding <code>EXPLAIN</code> before your <code>SELECT ... FROM ...</code>.
This will give you a “query plan”: a plan for how Postgres is going to find the data and its estimate for how much work each task will take.
There are many good guides for reading the output of these query plans like <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/reading-an-explain-analyze-query-plan">this one from thoughtbot</a> or <a href="https://pganalyze.com/docs/explain">this one from pganalyze</a>.
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/using-explain.html">The official docs</a> are also a good reference (albeit a bit overwhelming for a newbie).
For analyzing query plans, I’ve found <a href="https://explain.depesz.com/">this tool</a> to often be very helpful</p>

<h3 id="an-index-isnt-much-use-for-a-table-with-barely-any-rows-in-it">An index isn’t much use for a table with barely any rows in it</h3>

<p>This is particularly important when doing development on your local database.
Chances are, you don’t have millions of rows in your local database.
Postgres may find that it’s faster just to do a seq. scan rather than use the index at all if it’s just dealing with 100 rows.</p>

<h3 id="when-indexing-multiple-columns-the-order-matters">When indexing multiple columns, the order matters</h3>

<p>Postgres supports multicolumn indexes which do what you might expect:
if you create an index on columns <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> like so:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>CONCURRENTLY</span> <span>ON</span> <span>tbl</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>then a <code>WHERE</code> clause like</p>
<div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>tbl</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>AND</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>will be faster than if two separate indexes were created for <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> respectively.
This is because in one multicolumn index, Postgres just needs to traverse one B-tree which is able to efficiently combine the constraints of the search query.</p>

<p>This index speeds up queries filtering against just <code>a</code> just as much as an index against <code>a</code> alone.</p>

<p>But what about a query like <code>SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE b = 5;</code>?
Is that faster too?
Possibly, but not as fast as it could be.
It turns out the above index does <em>not</em> obviate the need for an index on <code>b</code> alone.
That’s because the B-tree in the index is first keyed on <code>a</code> and secondarily keyed on <code>b</code>.
So it will need to traverse all of the <code>a</code> values in the index to find all of the <code>b</code> values in the index.
Often if you need to use any combination of columns for you queries,
you’ll want to have indexes for both <code>(a, b)</code> as well as <code>b</code> alone.
That said, you may be able to rely on indexes on <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> separately,
depending on your needs.</p>

<h3 id="if-doing-prefix-matches-use-text_pattern_ops">If doing prefix matches, use <code>text_pattern_ops</code>
</h3>

<p>Let’s say you’re storing a hierarchical system of directories in your database using a <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/models-for-hierarchical-data/4179181#18">materialized path approach</a> (where you store a list of all of a row’s ancestors’ ids in each row) and for some part of your application you need to get all descendant directories.
So you need to query a table to find all rows where a column matches some common prefix:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>-- % is a wildcard: the `WHERE` clause here is asking for `directories` where `path` starts with '/1/2/3/'</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>directories</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>path</span> <span>LIKE</span> <span>'/1/2/3/%'</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>To keep things speedy, you add an index to the <code>path</code> column of <code>directories</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>CONCURRENTLY</span> <span>ON</span> <span>directories</span> <span>(</span><span>path</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Unfortunately, this may not be used:
Most kinds of indexes
(including the default B-tree index implicitly created in the <code>CREATE INDEX</code> statement above)
depend on the ordering of values to work.
To make Postgres able to do the basic character-by-character sorting that you need for this sort of prefix matching or pattern matching in general,
you need to give it a different <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-opclass.html">“operator class”</a> when defining the index:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>CONCURRENTLY</span> <span>ON</span> <span>directories</span> <span>(</span><span>path</span> <span>text_pattern_ops</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>



<h3 id="what-is-a-lock">What is a lock?</h3>
<p>A “lock” or “mutex” (short for “mutual exclusion”) ensures only one client can do something dangerous at a time.
This is a concept you’ll see in a lot of places but they’re particularly important in Postgres, as in any database, because updating an individual entity (whether that’s a row, table, view, etc.) must entirely succeed or entirely fail.
One way that operations could only partially succeed is if two different clients/processes were attempting to perform them at the same time.
As a result, any operation will need to acquire a “lock” on the relevant entity.</p>

<h3 id="how-locks-work-in-postgres">How locks work in Postgres</h3>
<p>In Postgres, there are several different locking levels for tables which are more or less restrictive.
Here’s just a few in order of less to more restrictive:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Lock Mode</th>
      <th>Example Statements</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ACCESS SHARE</code></td>
      <td><code>SELECT</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ROW SHARE</code></td>
      <td><code>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ROW EXCLUSIVE</code></td>
      <td>
<code>UPDATE</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, <code>INSERT</code>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE</code></td>
      <td><code>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>SHARE</code></td>
      <td>
<code>CREATE INDEX</code> (not <code>CONCURRENTLY</code>)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ACCESS EXCLUSIVE</code></td>
      <td>Many forms of <code>ALTER TABLE</code> and <code>ALTER INDEX</code>
</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>And here’s how they conflict (X means they are conflicting):</p>

<p>For example consider the following for a single table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Client 1 is doing…</th>
      <th>Client 2 wants to do a …</th>
      <th>Can Client 2 start?</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>UPDATE</code></td>
      <td><code>SELECT</code></td>
      <td>✅ <strong>Yes</strong>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>UPDATE</code></td>
      <td><code>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code></td>
      <td>🚫 <strong>No, must wait</strong>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>SELECT</code></td>
      <td><code>CREATE INDEX</code></td>
      <td>✅ <strong>Yes</strong>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>SELECT</code></td>
      <td><code>ALTER TABLE</code></td>
      <td>🚫 <strong>No, must wait</strong><sup id="fnref:alter_table_special_cases" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:alter_table_special_cases" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ALTER TABLE</code></td>
      <td><code>SELECT</code></td>
      <td>🚫 <strong>No, must wait</strong><sup id="fnref:alter_table_special_cases:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:alter_table_special_cases" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For a full list of all of this information, look at <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#LOCKING-TABLES">the official documentation</a>.
<a href="https://postgres-locks.husseinnasser.com/">This guide</a> is also a great reference to see what conflicts with what on an operation-by-operation basis (which is typically what you’re thinking about, instead of lock levels).</p>

<h3 id="how-this-can-cause-problems">How this can cause problems</h3>

<p>In the previous section, we noted that an if one client is performing an <code>ALTER TABLE</code> statement, that can block a <code>SELECT</code> from running.
This can be just as bad as it sounds if the <code>ALTER TABLE</code> statement takes a long time.
If you’re updating a core table (e.g. <code>users</code>, one that all requests for your web app may need to reference) all <code>SELECT</code>s reading from that table will just be waiting.
Before timing out, of course, causing your app to return 503s.</p>

<p>Common recipes for slow <code>ALTER TABLE</code> statements include</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adding a column with a non-constant default<sup id="fnref:default_changes" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:default_changes" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>
    <ul>
      <li>In my experience this is by far the most common cause of slowness</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Changing a column’s type</li>
  <li>Adding a uniqueness constraint</li>
</ul>

<p>So, let’s say you’re adding a new column to a heavily used table. 
You aren’t doing anything silly with your <code>ALTER TABLE</code> statements.
Sure, you’re adding a new column, but it doesn’t have a variable default.
This can still break your app.</p>

<p>See, that <code>ALTER TABLE</code> statement <em>will</em> be fast…once it acquires the lock.
But say that, years ago, you made some internal dashboard that does periodic queries against that table.
Over time, that query got slower and slower.
What once took milliseconds now takes minutes.
Which is normally fine–it’s just a <code>SELECT</code> statement after all.
But if your <code>ALTER TABLE</code> statement gets executed while one of those is running, it will have to wait.</p>

<p>That all probably isn’t too surprising.
But you might find this a bit surprising:
Any subsequent statements querying that table will have to wait, too.
That’s because Postgres locks form a queue:</p>

<p>For a great article on this exact scenario happening, see <a href="https://xata.io/blog/migrations-and-exclusive-locks">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="long-running-transactions-can-be-just-as-bad">Long-running transactions can be just as bad</h3>

<p>If you’re not familiar with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-transactions.html">transactions</a>, they’re a way of grouping together a series of database statements so they act as all-or-nothing (in fancy lingo, they’re “atomic”).
Once you begin a transaction (with <code>BEGIN</code>, of course), you’re hiding away.
No other clients can see any changes you’re making.
You can finish the transaction (with <code>COMMIT</code>) which then “publishes” them to the rest of the database.
Transactions are, in an abstract way, similar to locks: they allow you avoid issues with other clients messing up what you’re trying to do.</p>

<p>A classic example of a task begging for transactions is transferring money from one bank account to another.
You would want to decrement the balance of one account and increment the balance of the other.
If the database goes down or the originating account balance goes negative midway, you want to cancel the whole operation.
Transactions can make that possible.</p>

<p>However, you can easily shoot yourself in the foot when writing transactions if you keep them running too long.
That’s because once a transaction acquires a lock, it holds onto it until the transaction commits.
For example, let’s say Client 1 opened up <code>psql</code> and wrote the following:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>BEGIN</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>backpacks</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>UPDATE</span> <span>backpacks</span> <span>SET</span> <span>content_count</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>backpacks</span><span>;</span>
<span>-- ...</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Oops! Client 1 has stepped away from their desk:
Someone just brought home some cupcakes!
Even though Client 1 is effectively “done” updating the row with <code>id = 2</code>, they still have the lock.<sup id="fnref:row_locks" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:row_locks" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>
If another client wanted to delete this row, they would run this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>backpacks</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>-- ...</span>
<span>-- ?</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>But it would just hang.
It wouldn’t actually delete anything until Client 1 came back and committed the transaction.</p>

<p>You can imagine how this can lead to all kinds of scenarios where clients are holding onto locks for much longer than they need, preventing others from successfully making queries against or updates to the database.</p>

<h2 id="jsonb-is-a-sharp-knife">JSONB is a sharp knife</h2>

<p>Postgres has a remarkably powerful feature: you can store queryable and efficiently serialized JSON as a value in a row.<sup id="fnref:json_vs_jsonb" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:json_vs_jsonb" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>
In many ways, it makes Postgres have all the strengths of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database">document-oriented database</a> (like MongoDB, for example) without having to spin up a new service or coordinate between two different data stores.</p>

<p>However, it has its downsides if used improperly.</p>

<h3 id="jsonb-can-be-slower-than-normal-columns">JSONB can be slower than normal columns</h3>

<p>While JSONB is quite flexible, Postgres doesn’t keep track of statistics which can mean that an equivalent query against a set of “normal” columns can be significantly slower than against a single JSONB column.
<a href="https://www.heap.io/blog/when-to-avoid-jsonb-in-a-postgresql-schema">Here’s a great blog post with someone demonstrating it making things 2000x slower!</a></p>

<h3 id="jsonb-is-not-as-self-documenting-as-a-standard-table-schema">JSONB is not as self-documenting as a standard table schema</h3>

<p>A JSONB column can have basically anything in it–that’s one of the main reasons it’s so powerful!
But it also means you have few guarantees about how it’s structured.
With a normal table, you can look up the schema and see what a query will return.
Will a key be written in camelCase? snake_case?
Will states be described with boolean <code>true</code>/<code>false</code>? Or with enums like <code>yes</code>/<code>maybe</code>/<code>no</code>?
You have no idea with JSONB as it doesn’t have the same static typing that Postgres data normally has.</p>

<h3 id="jsonb-postgres-types-are-a-bit-awkward-to-work-with">JSONB Postgres types are a bit awkward to work with</h3>

<p>Let’s say you have a table called <code>backpacks</code> with a JSONB column <code>data</code> where you have a <code>brand</code> field.
You want to find the JanSport <code>backpacks</code> because you love the early 90s aesthetic.
So you write the query:<sup id="fnref:jsonb_subscripting" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:jsonb_subscripting" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
<div><pre><code><span>-- WARNING: Does not work!</span>
<span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> <span>backpacks</span> <span>where</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>'brand'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'JanSport'</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and you get the error back</p>
<div><pre><code>ERROR:  invalid input syntax for type json
LINE 1: select * from backpacks where data['brand'] = 'JanSport';
                                                      ^
DETAIL:  Token "JanSport" is invalid.
CONTEXT:  JSON data, line 1: JanSport
</code></pre></div>

<p>What gives?
Postgres is expecting the right-hand side type of the comparison to match the left-hand side type; that is, for it to be a correctly formatted JSON document–therefore, it needs to be a JSON object, array, string, number, boolean, or null.
Keep in mind that none of these types have anything to do with Postgres types like <code>boolean</code> or <code>integer</code>. And <code>NULL</code> in SQL works very differently from JSONB’s <code>null</code>, which acts more just like a normal type.<sup id="fnref:jsonb_null" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:jsonb_null" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>
To correctly write this query, you need to enable Postgres to be able to do some coercion.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> <span>backpacks</span> <span>where</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>'brand'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'"JanSport"'</span><span>;</span>
<span>-- ^ This is really equivalent to the following (because Postgres knows the left-hand side is `jsonb`)</span>
<span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> <span>backpacks</span> <span>where</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>'brand'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'"JanSport"'</span><span>::</span><span>jsonb</span><span>;</span>
<span>-- Alternatively, you could convert the left-hand side to Postgres `text`:</span>
<span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> <span>backpacks</span> <span>where</span> <span>data</span><span>-&gt;&gt;</span><span>'brand'</span> <span>=</span> <span>'JanSport'</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Note the double quotes inside the single quotes.
<code>JanSport</code> on its own isn’t valid JSON.</p>

<p>What’s more is <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html">there are a bunch more operators and functions</a> that are specific to JSONB and are hard to remember all at once.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.scannedinavian.com/images/holastafur.png"></p>
<p>This blog post was written together with <a href="https://mclare.blog/">&lt;mclare&gt;</a>, who made coooool visualizations like the picture at the end of the post!</p>
<h2 id="whats-a-bus-factor-or-truck-factor">What’s a Bus Factor or Truck Factor?</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “bus factor” is the minimum number of team members that have to suddenly disappear from a project before the project stalls due to lack of knowledgeable or competent personnel.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>In 2015 or so, my employer had layoffs.
One of them was the only contributor to part of the codebase that made money for our company.
I remembered reading about <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?TruckNumber">Truck Number</a> on the original wiki, so I thought it’d be fun to write a github enterprise plugin that calculates who you can’t afford to fire.
I enjoy reading research papers, and found this <a href="http://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/truckfactor/">truck factor</a> research paper.</p>
<p>I started writing the plugin, and talked five minutes on it at our Thursday afternoon lightning talks.
My coworkers said it would immediately hit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s Law</a>. They saw this as a way for management to easily calculate who you <strong>can</strong> fire!</p>
<h2 id="what">What?</h2>
<p>The original authors calculated how many people had to be hit by a bus for a bunch of popular GitHub projects to stall.
This includes the Linux kernel among others. In the first preprint, they said 80 people would have to leave the project for Linux to stop.</p>
<p>Last week I mentioned this blog post idea to mclare, and she said we should try to reproduce the results and see if the truck factor has improved in the past ten years.</p>
<p>The authors’ <a href="https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/Truck-Factor">github repo</a> is available and still works!</p>
<h2 id="are-we-able-to-reproduce-the-results">Are we able to reproduce the results?</h2>
<p>The Truck Factor research paper links to a <a href="https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/Truck-Factor">github repository</a>!
The data from the paper is available as JSON!
Their <a href="http://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/truckfactor/target.html">visualization</a> is backed by a CSV we can scrape!</p>
<p>But, we don’t know the <strong>date</strong> they pulled the data.</p>
<p>The README instructions don’t quite work, and we spent an hour figuring out how to execute the pieces.
Fortunately, the issues on the github repository told us how to fix the problem. I wanted results, not an afternoon of debugging their use of awk in shell scripts.
mclare got the list of github repos out of the first column of their CSV. We needed to clone them all!
We had fun learning about <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">gnu parallel</a> to run a bunch of git clone commands at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="gnu-parallel">Gnu Parallel</h3>
<p>Why does <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">gnu parallel</a> use <strong>all</strong> the cores when we tell it to use only 8?
We only saw eight <code>git clone</code> processes at a time, but a large number of <code>git index-pack</code> processes that maxed out all 32 cores on my laptop.
I’m guessing git’s index-pack is a forked subprocess and allows parallel to start another git clone?
If you know the answer, send us a message!</p>
<h3 id="ruby-gems-in-nixos">Ruby Gems in NixOS</h3>
<p>The Truck Factor code uses <a href="https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist">linguist</a> to filter out files that are only documentation. Later in the paper the authors say that documentation is the best way to keep your project alive, so I’m not convinced that’s good.</p>
<p>In any case, I’m running NixOS and have no experience with Ruby, thus installing Ruby Gems did not fit in the time I had.
If you know a good way to install the linguist plugin in a Nix flake, please send me a message! (or even a <a href="https://github.com/spite-driven-development/Truck-Factor">pull request</a>)</p>
<h2 id="but-how-did-you-recalculate-the-results">But, <strong>how</strong> did you recalculate the results?</h2>
<p>We forked the original repository on github, cloned it locally, and puzzled our way through the README.
We used <code>mvn package</code> to compile the Java source into a jar, and tried each of the steps on the numpy github repository.
Then we were ready to recalculate all the things.</p>
<p>mclare downloaded the CSV from the authors’ <a href="http://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/truckfactor/target.html">visualization</a> and we converted the first column into a <a href="https://github.com/spite-driven-development/Truck-Factor/blob/master/meta/repo_list.txt">list of github repositories</a>.
I started with a for loop, but mclare switched to gnu parallel, because it’s cool. Also because everything gets done faster.</p>

<p>I have a fast gigabit internet connection at home, it took 17.5 minutes to clone all the repos one at a time.
Processing each repo took about the same time, eighteen minutes maybe?</p>
<p>Here’s one example output for the linux kernel repository:</p>

<li><label>does the truck factor calculation take into account git’s co-authored-by and reviewer headers? If not, could it?</label></li>
<li><label>why is our number for Linux so very different ten years later? The original paper gives a truck factor of 80, we get EIGHT!</label>
<ul>
<li><label>The original paper uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance</a> of one to find and merge developer aliases. I don’t think we did that. Maybe that changes our number?</label></li>
<li><label>Would this version of the truck factor code still give us 80 if we checkout the Linux kernel repo at mid-2015 ? According to the git history, the algorithm was updated in 2016, could we get new numbers for a later blog post?</label></li>
</ul></li>
<li><label>We could look at some of the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5286537198548981618&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,22">156 citations</a> of this paper and see if someone came up with a better calculation.</label></li>
<li><label>We could compare popular projects of today to their history. Rust and other recent big names are not mentioned in the 2015 paper. For that matter, we could write a script to find yearly truck numbers for any git repo.</label></li>
<li><label>Shae wants to figure out how to install Ruby Gems in NixOS so the linguist plugin can filter out which files are only documentation.</label></li>

<h2 id="conclusion---bus-factors-got-scarier">Conclusion - Bus Factors got scarier.</h2>
<p>The biggest question we both had was, did it get any better?</p>
<p>I’m gonna say no, it’s gotten worse.
The 2015 <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/1233v1.pdf">preprint</a> of this paper gave the linux kernel a truck factor of ninety!
The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06766">full publication</a> gave that same repository a truck number of fifty seven.</p>
<p>Without the linguist plugin to filter out documentation and third party libraries, we got a truck factor of twelve for the Linux kernel repository.
After mclare installed the plugin on her system, she got a truck factor of eight for the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>This is not an improvement.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the replies.<br>
The Macbook is a 2010 17" so it would have been pretty easy to upgrade and repair (socketed Ram and HDD, screwed in battery) but the age would have made this laptop not only unusably slow but it was also dead as a doornail. Its one of the still good Macbooks with the glowing apple logo.<br>
Yes, all the green PCBs are made by me.</p>

            <p>Sorry it isn’t quite clear to me, is that additional fan adding to the existing cpu cooling solution because you saw overheating or to get the most thermal performance?</p>

            <p>Yes its adding to the existing cpu cooling. The first prototype of this I build was using an i5 1135 cpu and was getting pretty hot. So I figured adding an additional heatsink and fan would help. On the Ryzen board im not sure I would have gone through that trouble again, its running much cooler.</p>

            <p>If you dont add a second cooling fan I dont think that would be an issue on the 15 inch. The 13 might be difficult to fit the battery but I think it would be possible.</p>

							<p>Apple apparently hasn’t learned much from the criticism it took earlier this year for an ad showing creative works unceremoniously crushed in an industrial press (see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2024/05/10/apple-apologizes-for-tone-deaf-crush-ipad-pro-ad/">Apple Apologizes for Tone-Deaf “Crush!” iPad Pro Ad</a>,” 10 May 2024). A pair of new ads for Apple Intelligence portray the Writing Tools and Memories movies as tools for those unwilling to put in any effort.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m0MoYKwVTM">first ad</a>, Apple Intelligence enables a goof-off who wastes time and annoys his colleagues to surprise his boss with an unexpectedly well-written email. It’s not clear that the boss is impressed; he just can’t believe the guy would have written a professional message.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Apple Intelligence | Writing Tools | iPhone 16" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3m0MoYKwVTM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Is the message that Apple Intelligence is aimed at the perpetually lazy? Where’s the positive ad with a dyslexic child using Writing Tools to proofread a school essay or a businessperson using it to understand a complex report dumped on them minutes before a meeting?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0BXZhdDqZM">second ad</a> channels a similar suggestion—that Apple Intelligence is a crutch for the thoughtless. In it, a woman realizes that she has forgotten her husband’s birthday only after their kids give him thoughtful, homemade gifts, so she quickly uses Apple Intelligence to create a Memories movie of the children doing woodworking with their father. Apple Intelligence to the rescue! Apparently, making a Memories movie is easier than creating a repeating annual calendar event.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Apple Intelligence | Create memory movies | iPhone 16" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0BXZhdDqZM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Why would Apple want to promote the idea that Apple Intelligence can bail you out from failing to pay attention to the most important people in your life? It’s trivially easy to imagine positive scenarios enhanced by a Memories movie, such as a teen sharing photos with an ailing grandparent in the hospital or high school friends reconnecting over shared sports photos. They might be a touch cloying, but Memories movies trend in that direction anyway.</p>
<p>As it stands now, and likely as it will be in its next release, Apple Intelligence won’t change the world or even your everyday Mac experience. But it can make a difference for some, and Apple would be better served by showing it helping those who are already trying to do good work and be good people.</p>
<p>Imagine you work at Apple’s ad agency. What ads would you like to see showcasing Apple Intelligence features?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header></header><section><p>I have shipped a lot of different projects over the last ~10 years in tech. I often get tapped to lead new ones when it’s important to get it right, because I’m good at it. Shipping in a big tech company is a very different skill to writing code, and lots of people who are great at writing code are terrible at shipping.</p>
<p>Here’s what I think about when I’m leading a project and what I’ve seen people get wrong.</p>
<h2>Shipping is hard</h2>
<p>The most common error I see is to assume that shipping is easy. The default state of a project is to <em>not ship</em>: to be delayed indefinitely, cancelled, or to go out half-baked and burst into flames. Projects do not ship automatically once all the code has been written or all the Jira tickets closed. They ship because someone takes up the difficult and delicate job of shipping them.</p>
<p>That means that in almost all cases, <strong>shipping has to come first</strong>. You cannot have anything else as your top priority. If you spend all your time worrying about polishing the customer experience (for example), you will not ship! Obsessing over UX is praiseworthy behaviour when you are an engineer on the team, but a blunder if you are leading the project. You should cherish the other engineers on your team who are doing that work, and give them as much support as you can. But your primary concern has to be shipping the project. It is too hard a job to do in your spare time.</p>
<p>In my experience, projects almost always ship because one single person makes them ship. To be clear, that person doesn’t write all the code or do all the work, and I’m not saying the project could ship without an entire team behind it. But it’s <em>really important</em> that one person on the project has an end-to-end understanding of the whole thing: how it hangs together technically, and what product or business purpose it serves. Good teams and companies understand this, and make sure every project has a single responsible engineer (typically this position is called a “technical lead” or “DRI” role). Bad teams and companies don’t do this, and projects live and die based on whether an engineer steps up into this role of their own accord.</p>
<h2>What is shipping?</h2>
<p>Why do so many engineers think shipping is easy? I know it sounds extreme, but I think many engineers do not understand what shipping even is inside a large tech company. What does it mean to ship? It does <em>not</em> mean deploying code or even making a feature available to users. Shipping is a social construct within a company.Concretely, that means that <strong>a project is shipped when the important people at your company believe it is shipped.</strong> If you deploy your system, but your manager or VP or CEO is very unhappy with it, <em>you did not ship</em>. (Maybe you shipped something, but you didn’t ship the actual project.) You only know you’ve shipped when your company’s leadership acknowledge you’ve shipped. A congratulations message in Slack from your VP is a good sign, as is an internal blog post that claims victory. For small ships, an atta-boy from your manager will do.</p>
<p>This probably sounds circular, but I think it’s a really important point. Of course if you deploy something that users love and makes a ton of money, you’ve shipped. But that’s only true because satisfying users and making money is something that makes your leadership team happy. If you ship something users hate and makes no money, but your leadership team is happy, <em>you still shipped</em>. You can feel any way you like about that, but it’s true. If you don’t like it, you should probably go work for companies that really care how happy their users are.</p>
<p>Engineers who think shipping means delivering a spec or deploying code will repeatedly engineer their way into failed ships.</p>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>So if your primary job when shipping something is to make your company’s leadership happy with the project, what does that mean in practice? First, <strong>you have to get clear on what the company is looking to get out of the project</strong>. Sometimes it’s extracting more money from a small set of users (e.g. enterprise features). Sometimes it’s spending money to grow the total set of users (e.g. splashy free-tier features). Sometimes it’s mollifying a particular very large customer by building a feature specifically for them. Sometimes it’s just an influential VP or CEO’s pet project, and you need to align with their vision. There are lots of potential reasons, and if you want to ship the project you need to know which ones apply in this case. Align your work and communication accordingly! For instance, enterprise features often don’t need splashy UI but are completely inflexible on requirements, end-user features need to be polished, pet projects mean you need to be in active communication with the specific mover and shaker whose pet it is, and so on.</p>
<p>Second, no matter the project goal, your leadership team (the people in your reporting chain who care about the project) will always have basically zero technical context about the project compared to you. That means they will be trusting you for estimates, to answer technical questions, and to anticipate technical problems. <strong>Maintaining that trust should be your top priority</strong>. If they don’t have faith in your ability to do the job and to keep them informed, you will not ship. They’ll de-risk by cancelling the project, or letting it roll out with zero attention or celebration (remember that an un-celebrated launch is not a ship!) Alternatively, they’ll sideline you and go to another engineer, who will then formally or informally be the one who actually ships the project. Either way, you’ll feel it at review time and they’ll go to someone else for the next one.</p>
<p>How do you maintain trust with your leadership team? This could be a whole article (or book) by itself, but here’s my summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The best thing is a track record of having shipped in the past, if you can get it</li>
<li>Project confidence (if you’re visibly worried, they will be too)</li>
<li>Project competence. You want to aim for something like a NASA mission control vibe</li>
<li>Communicate professionally and concisely, and don’t make them chase you for updates: post a daily or weekly thread somewhere</li>
</ul>
<p>It is much, much more important to do these things than for the project to ship with zero bugs on the exact deadline. If a project has to be delayed for technical reasons, in my experience you will not suffer consequences so long as you communicate it clearly, confidently (and ideally with some warning). In fact, it’s paradoxically often <em>better</em> for you if there is some kind of problem that forces a delay, for the same reason that the heroic on-call engineer who hotfixes an incident gets more credit than the careful engineer who prevents one.</p>
<h2>Getting into production</h2>
<p>Even so, you typically still have to get the project into production. The most common problem here is missing a key detail. Sometimes it’s a technical detail: maybe we rely on storing the user documents in Memcached, but many documents are multiple megabytes and will be larger than the Memcached block size. Sometimes it’s a detail of coordination: maybe the platform team that owns Memcached was expecting one-tenth of the traffic our project will send them, so they call a meeting with the VPs and delay the project. Sometimes it’s a legal detail: maybe the user data is unexpectedly sensitive, and our system doesn’t have the controls we’d need to handle it safely. These issues can come from anywhere, and are very hard to anticipate. Dealing with them requires a deep technical understanding of the system and the ability to pivot quickly.</p>
<p>For instance, you may have read that first example and are now thinking “well, you could split the documents across multiple Memcached keys, or increase the block size, or move to Redis, etc…“. All of those are potential solutions! But knowing which of those solutions will work - and more importantly, which of those solutions will not blow out the project timeline - is impossible unless you’ve got a deep understanding.</p>
<p>This is doubly important because the problem in question doesn’t even need to be real. In the lead up to a project launch, it’s very common for other teams or engineers to raise <em>potential</em> problems (e.g. “hey, are we sure the user data will fit in Memcached?“) If nobody steps forward and explains why this isn’t a problem (or if it is, how it’s being addressed before launch), the project will be delayed, and it will be your responsibility. Why? Because your manager (or their manager) will not know whether this is a serious problem. That’s what they pay you for! If you’re not stepping up to address it, they will naturally err on the side of caution and <em>not ship</em>.</p>
<p>You need to stay light on your feet so that when these issues come up you’re not neck-deep in other work. That usually means not being fully heads-down on implementation (i.e. delegating tasks to other engineers on the project). Ideally you should have at least 20% of your time free from implementation in the early stages of the project, scaling up to 90-100% in the final days. If you do that, when issues do come up you’ll be able to grant them your full attention.</p>
<h2>Can we ship right now?</h2>
<p>Feature flags are the best way I’ve seen to do this, but staging environments also work, and so on. The key thing is to get whatever you’re building in front of as many eyes as possible: yours, but also other engineers, and ideally leadership, product, design and so on. Five minutes playing with the actual feature, even in a very rough state, will bring up issues that nobody anticipated. Being able to directly see it themselves also does wonders for reassuring leadership that you’ve got things under control.</p>
<p>The best way to anticipate problems is to deploy early. In general, a helpful question to ask is <strong>can I ship this right now?</strong> Not this week, not today: right this second. If not, what would have to change for me to be able to ship <em>something</em>? If the ship needs a deploy, can that happen now behind a feature flag? If we’re waiting on some other team to make a change on their end, can I make it so the system doesn’t strictly require their change after all? For instance, if the platform team is setting up a cache layer, I could make it so my feature still works (albeit a little slower) if it can’t find the cache.</p>
<p>Remember, your main priority is maintaining trust with your leadership team. Nothing builds trust like having fallback plans, because in case of emergency fallback plans indicate control over the situation. If the worst does happen and you can’t release on the day, your manager will be much happier going to their manager about it if they can say something like “our options are to delay four days, or ship tomorrow by sacrificing X” - even if sacrificing X is a non-starter. That means they’ll be more likely to interpret the delay as an unavoidable problem that you handled effectively, instead of as a mistake you made that means they can’t rely on you.</p>
<p>I think a lot of engineers hold off on deploys essentially out of fear. If you want to ship, you need to do the exact opposite: you need to deploy as much as you can as early as possible, and you need to do the scariest changes as early as you can possibly do them. Remember that you have the most end-to-end context on the project, which means <strong>you should be the least scared of scary changes</strong>. Everyone else is dealing with more unknowns and is going to be even less keen to pull the big lever. (If there’s some other engineer who is across all of this who you’re waiting for, bad news: they’re probably the one actually shipping your project).</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shipping is really hard and you have to make it your main priority if you want to ship</li>
<li>Shipping doesn’t mean deploying code, it means making your leadership team happy</li>
<li>You need your leadership team to trust you in order to ship</li>
<li>Most of the essential technical work is in anticipating problems and creating fallback plans</li>
<li>You should asking yourself “can I ship right this second?”</li>
<li>Have courage!</li>

<p>If you’ve been reading this blog for any length of time, you’ll know that maps and history are two of my favorite things. I love history because I love learning about the vast panoply of the human experience, the millions of twisting threads of time that created the world we live in today. And I love maps because I don’t think you can really <em>understand </em>the world without being able to picture it. Maps are such amazing tools, laying out in detail how the world functions, its geography and politics and topography, and the ways in which those change over time. It probably won’t surprise you, then, to know that I like historical maps quite a lot. Learning about how someone chooses to depict the world can tell you quite a lot about their point of view, and seeing the way in which people in different times make different choices about how and what to illustrate can show you how our perception of the world has changed. That’s what we’re going to do today. I have here a small collection of historical maps that I think are <em>really cool</em>, and that I think can teach us something about our shared past. </p>



<p>In today’s edition, we’re going to look at the Second World War, with a particular focus on the maps that newspapers would print so their readership could follow along as the world burned. So, without further ado:</p>



<p>Previous Installments: <a href="https://nathangoldwag.wordpress.com/2017/05/08/visualizing-the-great-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWI</a>, <a href="https://nathangoldwag.wordpress.com/2022/03/26/visualizing-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part One</a>, <a href="https://nathangoldwag.wordpress.com/2023/05/19/visualizing-the-past-part-two/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part Two</a>, <a href="https://nathangoldwag.wordpress.com/2024/06/09/visualizing-the-past-part-three/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part Three</a> </p>



<p>In February 1942, as the United States reeled from the Pearl Harbor attack and girded itself for intercontinental warfare, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave a speech to the American people about the coming conflict: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>This war is a new kind of war. It is different from all other wars of the past, not only in its methods and weapons but also in its geography. It is warfare in terms of every continent, every island, every sea, every air lane in the world.</p>



<p>That is the reason why I have asked you to take out and spread before you a map of the whole earth, and to follow with me the references which I shall make to the world-encircling battle lines of this war. Many questions will, I fear, remain unanswered tonight; but I know you will realize that I cannot cover everything in any one short report to the people.</p>
<cite><em>Fireside Chat, February 23, 1942</em>, Franklin D. Roosevelt (<a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/fireside-chat-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Source</a>)</cite></blockquote>



<p>This was a global war, fought by a modern population with access to modern information sources. The new technologies that allowed millions of men to be mobilized allowed their families at home to follow along with a level of detail never before possible, and newspapers rushed to provide it. </p>



<figure><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/ut1FHrR.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ut1FHrR.jpg"></a>
</p></figure>



<p>We’ll start with this map, published in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> on September 10th, 1939, only ten days after Germany’s invasion of Poland. This is a wonderful example of what I love about this genre of work–the depth of detail and information that newspapers were attempting to convey to their readers. In 1939, the world was beginning to fall to pieces, and everybody knew it, and a lot of people wanted to <em>know more</em>. This map includes instructions for removing it from the paper and preserving it, under the assumption that you’d want to keep it to follow the course of the conflict. What I also love about this is that it’s from early enough in the war that the patterns and narratives that we take for granted haven’t coalesced yet. The USSR, Italy, and Balkan states are still neutral, and Charles H. Owens of <em>The Times</em> art staff takes note of potential rail and sea corridors with which the Western Allies could supply Poland–something that never materialized. Note also the focus on naval bases, fortifications, strategic resources, and the aerial distance between cities, as the artist tries to grapple with the new kind of warfare that was still being born. It’s a wonderful achievement.  </p>



<p>I cannot help but notice, however, that Mr. Owens has forgotten about the existence of Estonia. </p>



<figure><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/pJosxOq.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pJosxOq.jpg"></a>
</p></figure>



<p>Jumping back in time a few months, here we have a map of Germany at its greatest pre-war extent, following the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anschluss</a></em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Munich Agreement</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectorate_of_Bohemia_and_Moravia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Occupation of Czechoslovakia</a>. There are a few things of interest about this. Firstly, how contemporaneous it is–dated May 1939, it was only printed three months after the final events depicted had occurred. Second is how granular it is. We tend to blur many of the fine distinctions and territorial adjustments made by the NSDAP during this period, seeing everything as Allies, Axis, and/or Soviet, but issues like the independence of Slovakia and the cession of Carpatho-Ukraine to Hungary <a href="https://nathangoldwag.wordpress.com/2021/03/16/the-war-aims-of-the-lesser-axis-powers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were of vital interest</a> to participants at the time. Third and last, we should take note of the source, the German Library of Information, in New York. <a href="https://commons.und.edu/theses/928/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This was a</a> Nazi propaganda bureau established in 1936, specifically to try and influence American public opinion and popularize the German perspective on international affairs. (I appreciate the comparison of the German Reich’s scale to that of Texas, which I suspect was an attempt to emphasize how small it still was compared to the US). Today we’re so used to engaging with this time period from the perspective of either victors or apologists, that we forget that something like this map of territorial conquest–now seen only as an ominous indictment–could be presented as an achievement to be celebrated, even to a neutral audience. </p>



<figure><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/O4tp7JB.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/O4tp7JB.jpg"></a>
</p></figure>



<p>Another propaganda map, this one published by the <em>Los Angeles Examiner</em> in 1937, showing the potential results of an American defeat in another world war, the specter of which was already rearing up over Europe. What’s fun about this one is that it is agnostic on <em>who </em>exactly would be defeating us; several years before the outbreak of the war, the coalition lines not yet firmly drawn, the <em>Examiner </em>focuses on speculating as to what resources and regions would be most coveted by the “victorious powers”, leaving it up to the reader’s imagination who those would be, exactly. It’s an intriguing look at the kind of perspective that I’m trying to showcase here, before hindsight solidified our understanding of the possible. Note, for example, that the main comparison point here is the post-WWI fate of Germany and Austria, as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partitions of Poland</a>. The <em>Los Angeles Examine</em>r opposed America’s entry into the First World War, and you can perhaps see echoes of that here.</p>



<figure><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/0ipY0KH.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0ipY0KH.jpg"></a>
</p></figure>



<p>The <em>San Francisco Examiner</em> published this map on June 2nd, 1940, just eight days before Italy entered the war on the side of the Axis, and it’s an absolutely <em>gorgeous </em>example of its genre. This map doesn’t just show you Italy and the Mediterranean, it attempts to give the reader the geopolitical and geographic context for the war, and what the various powers hoped to gain from it. Note how the headline correctly identifies the driving force behind Mussolini’s ambitions, completing the goals that Italy had failed to achieve in WWI. Three days after this was printed, Mussolini would tell Chief of the General Staff Pietro Badoglio “I only need a few thousand dead so that I can sit at the peace conference as a man who has fought”. I love this map because it really does tell you so much of what would happen over the next few years in this theater of war; from the conflicts in the Balkans as nations chose sides or were torn apart, the various imperialist and irredentist claims that <em>Il Duce</em> was pushing against his neighbors, to the vital supply lines between Sicily and Tripoli that Rommel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Desert_campaign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would depend on</a>, and the thorn in its side at Malta, and Italy’s dependence on foreign trade routes with the Americas and the British Empire. The game board is set, the pieces are ready, and now we’re just waiting for someone to make the first move.  </p>

<p>Another example of the same genre, this one published by the <em>Chicago Daily Tribune</em>, a week after Pearl Harbor. The focus here is to show how the Japanese Empire has expanded over the previous fifty years, through the First Sino-Japanese War, Russo-Japanese War, World War I, and Second-Sino-Japanese War, leading up to the present crisis, with the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy threatening to overrun the East Indies and Philippines. The breakdown in expansion over time is so valuable, showing how these crises didn’t emerge from thin air, or from some primordial conflict, but were the result of long-running dynamics. With this, we can understand both the threat of Imperial Japan in 1941–and also how fragile it really was. </p>



<p>Note also the caption at the very bottom of the page: “This is another in the series of new colored war maps–offered as an aid to readers in visualizing the extent of the enemy empire across the Pacific.” </p>



<figure><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/rdqQtFd.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rdqQtFd.jpg"></a>
</p></figure>



<p>Here we see an effort by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_War_Relief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Russian War Relief</a> Inc. to convey to the American people the scale and scope of the Eastern Front, and what the USSR was suffering in the war. You can find a similar juxtaposition map in my earlier WWI collection, and I think it says something about America’s uniquely privileged position over the last few centuries that these maps are the only way we can truly imagine our country occupied or invaded, and the rather desperate attempts by our allies to convince us of the true severity of their plight. Here the Soviets try and demonstrate to America what was happening there; the entire eastern seaboard occupied by a genocidal army, Rochester cut off and besieged for months, American soldiers fighting for every square inch of St. Louis as enemy tanks drive deep into the Southwest, tens of millions of refugees fleeing as the world ends around them. You can’t help but admit that it’s a very effective tool.  </p>

<p>This is a really interesting item; a world map focusing not on borders or armies or resources but on air routes, the new field of battle truly coming into its own for the first time. Airplanes and airships were more than just useful tools or weapons, they were the subject of popular fascination and military imagination, as people tried to imagine the new world taking shape. H.G. Wells’ 1907 novel <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_in_the_Air" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The War in the Air</a></em>, in which fleets of aerial weapons destroy all of civilization, was emblematic of the fears of the time, which seemed to be vindicated by WWI. Following the war, innovative military theorists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulio_Douhet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Giulio Douhet</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Mitchell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Billy Mitchell</a> envisioned a new type of warfare, in which air power would render everything else obsolete. This map, presented by the World Publishing Company of Cleveland, Ohio, makes an attempt to chart out the terrain and environment of this new stratospheric conflict that they could just see coming into view.  </p>

<p>Earlier this year I was visiting family in Pennsylvania when I stumbled across a book entitled <em>Special Edition World War II: Six Years that Changed the World, 1939-1945</em>, containing reproductions of the front pages of the <em>Intelligencer</em> <em>Journal</em>, <em>Lancaster New Era</em>, and <em>Sunday News</em> from those years. I bought it at once. It’s an amazing resource, showing not just how contemporaries witnessed the war years, but specifically how they were covered by the newspapers of a relatively small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster,_Pennsylvania" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provincial city</a>. The paper’s article on Pearl Harbor, for example, <a href="https://nathangoldwag.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241026_132614.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features an inset</a> covering a sailor from Lancaster who was stationed at Hickam Field. This map, provided by the United Press, dates to May 10th, 1940, the same day that Germany launched <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall Gelb</a></em>, the stunningly successful invasion of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. It’s another example of this wonderful series of attempts to communicate the strategic situation to the public, published right at the moment when that situation irrevocably shifted. </p>



<figure><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/xRmjVNu.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xRmjVNu.jpg"></a>
</p></figure>



<p>Can Hitler invade England this year? Will he? To us, those are questions of alternate history–and not particularly interesting ones, for that matter. Most students of World War II will tell you that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea_Lion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Operation Sea Lion</a> was never more than a pipe dream, and that the Nazis never had anything close to the resources needed to successfully carry it out. But to Americans in 1941 who’d watched France–widely regarded then as one of the most powerful countries on Earth–be humiliated and crushed by the Wehrmacht in only three months the previous year, it was a very real topic of concern. The <em>Intelligencer</em> <em>Journal</em> here attempts to game out the scenarios, examining how the new, ill-understood weapon systems of submarines and aircraft might allow Hitler to do what Napoleon never could. </p>



<p>There is something surreal about seeing charts of German airborne landings in England, not presented in a speculative fiction novel, but in the respectable local paper of a small American city, alongside headlines like “County Youth, 19, Has Meningitis” and “Poultry Meeting at Maytown High.” </p>



<figure><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/kaMISFU.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kaMISFU.jpg"></a>
</p></figure>



<p>Here we see another example from the same source, this time showing a diagram of the Allied landing of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Torch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Operation Torch</a> in November 1942. There’s a few reasons I wanted to spotlight this. First is the granularity of it, and the window it gives us into how people would have experienced these events. We see this as history, as clean lines on a map representing something immovably fixed in the past. But seventy years ago, Americans would have used maps like this to try and keep track of where their family members were, what they were doing, what they were facing. Operation Torch was the first large-scale US involvement in the European theater, and for those left behind at home, maps like this would have been their only way of knowing exactly what their loved ones were facing. </p>



<p>The other thing I love about this is that the creator seems to have added a completely fictional Free French advance up from Lake Chad through southern Tripolitania to outflank the Afrika Korps, something that would have been wildly impractical given that the Sahara Desert was in the way, and (as far as I know?) never even contemplated by Allied High Command. You can’t always trust what you read in the newspapers. </p>

<p><em>I love this so much.</em> We’ve talked a lot here about hindsight and perspective, and about how people living through events often have a very different way of looking at them than we do. But this “Ten Year Map” shows us that sometimes, people understand very well what they’re seeing. The <em>Intelligencer</em> <em>Journal</em> published this in November 1939, just a few months into the general European war, but what it does beautifully is place that war into the context of the geopolitical chaos that had engulfed the world over the preceding decade. “What The Decade Has Done To The Map” indeed. We see here not just German expansion in central Europe, and war with Poland, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish Civil War</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Italian invasion of Ethiopia</a>, Japan’s conflicts with China and Russia, border disputes in South America and the Middle East, the growth of long-distance air travel, and how the New Deal and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Valley_Authority" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tennessee Valley Authority</a> reshaped the American landscape. The 1930s were an extraordinarily tumultuous decade, as the fragile post-WWI order began to implode, and I’ve never seen a better illustration of it. All put together like this, we can really see the fracture points and battle lines of the new world war coming into view. </p>



<p>And it’s all the more remarkable to realize that they were seeing this as it happened, in real time, unable to do anything but watch and read the morning paper. </p>
