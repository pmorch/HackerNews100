<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-controller="anchors" data-toc-target="content">
<p>Containerization has become an essential tool for developers and system
operators to package and deploy applications on various systems and platforms
efficiently. Many containerization solutions exist today, but without a doubt,
Docker has emerged as the de facto standard. This is largely due to its
excellent tooling, strong community, and vast ecosystem of pre-built images that
can be easily shared and used across different environments.</p><p>Docker has held this position for many years, and it has truly revolutionized
how applications are shipped. At the same time, its wide adoption inspired the
development of many other containerization solutions offering even more features
and capabilities. One such solution is <a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://podman.io/">Podman<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>.</p><p>Podman is an open-source container engine that aims to provide a more secure and
lightweight alternative to Docker. It allows users to run containers without
requiring a daemon, making it easier to manage and deploy containers on a
variety of systems. Additionally, Podman offers better security defaults through
features such as rootless containers (i.e., running containers through non-root
users), user namespaces, and a more careful utilization of kernel capabilities,
all of which can protect the host system from potential vulnerabilities and
security threats.</p><p>With its growing community and close compatibility with Docker images and
commands, Podman has gained significant traction among developers and system
administrators looking for alternative containerization solutions.</p><p>In this article, we'll explore some of the key features and benefits of using
Podman as a containerization tool. We'll also discuss how it compares to Docker
and see why it has become a popular alternative choice in the industry.</p><p>Let's dive right in.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before proceeding with this article, ensure that you meet the following
prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Linux command-line skills.</li>
<li>Prior experience with Docker.</li>
<li>(Optional) A Docker Hub account to follow the private registry setup examples.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="podman-vs-docker-comparison">Podman vs Docker Comparison</h2>
<p>While both Podman and Docker allow users to run, manage, and deploy containers
in an efficient and scalable manner, there are some key differences between the
two. In this section, we will explore several of these differences:</p>
<h3 id="1-architecture-differences">1. Architecture differences</h3>
<p>One of the main differences between Podman and Docker lies in their
architecture. While Docker relies on a client-server model, Podman employs a
daemonless architecture. With Podman's approach, users manage containers
directly, eliminating the need for a continuous daemon process in the
background. This direct management often results in Podman containers launching
significantly faster, sometimes up to 50% quicker than Docker, depending on the
image used.</p><p>This architecture also enhances security. In Docker, initiating a container
means sending a request to the Docker daemon via the Docker client which
subsequently launches the container, which means that the container processes
are children of the Docker daemon, not the user session:</p>
<p>As a result, any significant event coming from a container process that's picked
up by the Linux Audit system (<code>auditd</code>) specifies its audit user ID as <code>unset</code>
rather than the actual ID of the user who started the respective container in
the first place. This makes it extremely difficult to link malicious activity to
a specific user and taints the security of the system.</p>
<p>With Podman, since each container is instantiated directly through a user login
session, the container process data retains this information and <code>auditd</code> can
accurately detect and list the ID of each user who started a specific container
process, maintaining a clear audit trail.</p>
<h3 id="2-container-lifecycle-management">2. Container lifecycle management</h3>
<p>The absence of a daemon in Podman leads to a distinct approach to managing
container lifecycles compared to Docker. On Linux, Podman relies extensively on
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://systemd.io/">Systemd<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a> for this purpose. For instance, to correctly
enforce restart policies for containers using the <code>--restart always</code> flag,
Podman relies on a <code>systemd</code> service called <code>podman-restart</code>. This service
automatically restarts all designated containers after each system reboot.</p><p>Moreover, Podman exposes a handy command for generating Systemd service files
from running containers. This allows you to bring your containers under
<code>systemd</code> management to start, stop, and inspect the various services running
inside of them more easily. In contrast, Docker handles all these tasks
internally through the daemon itself.</p>
<h3 id="3-container-orchestration">3. Container orchestration</h3>
<p>When developing locally, Docker users normally reach for
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a> to define and manage
multi-container applications more easily. While Podman doesn't support Compose
files out of the box, it provides a compatible alternative called
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/containers/podman-compose">Podman Compose<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>, which typically
works seamlessly with existing <code>docker-compose.yml</code> files. For a native
experience, you may also use pods, a concept that Podman borrows from
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a> and allows users to manage a group of
containers as one uniform unit.</p><p>When it comes to production deployment, Podman lacks a tool like
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/">Docker Swarm<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a> for orchestrating
multi-container application workloads. The best possible alternative in such
cases is to use an external orchestration system such as Kubernetes, which
offers similar features and integrates well with Podman, although it may require
some additional configuration and setup to ensure that everything works
correctly.</p>
<h3 id="4-security-considerations">4. Security considerations</h3>
<p>Containers aim to isolate applications from the host system securely, minimizing
compatibility issues and enhancing security. A primary security concern is the
risk of container breakout, where an attacker could compromise the host system.
To mitigate such risks, running containers with minimal privileges is essential.</p><p>Podman is designed to help with this by providing stronger default security
settings compared to Docker. Features like
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/">rootless containers<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>,
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/">user namespaces<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>, and
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/">seccomp profiles<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>, while
available in Docker, aren't enabled by default and often require extra setup.</p><p>Podman's default setup includes rootless containers running in isolated user
namespaces, limiting the impact of any potential breakout. In contrast, Docker's
default setting runs container processes as <code>root</code>, posing a higher risk in case
of a breakout.</p><p>Moreover, Podman containers, tied to user sessions, allow audit systems to trace
malicious activities back to specific users, unlike Docker, where tracing to a
user is challenging due to the system-wide daemon.</p><p>Podman and Docker use Linux kernel capabilities and seccomp profiles to control
process permissions. By default, Podman launches containers with a narrower set
of 11 capabilities compared to Docker's more permissive default setting of 14
capabilities.</p><p>In general, while both Podman and Docker can be configured for robust security,
Podman generally requires less effort to reach a secure configuration.</p><p><strong>Learn More</strong>: <a rel="" target="" href="https://betterstack.com/community/guides/scaling-docker/docker-security-best-practices/">Docker Security: 14 Best Practices You Should

<p>With all of this clarified, let's go ahead and install Podman locally.</p>
<h2 id="installing-podman">Installing Podman</h2>
<p>Like Docker, Podman can run without a problem on all popular operating systems.
This includes macOS and Windows, as well as all major Linux distributions. The
only significant difference to note is that while Podman can run natively on
Linux, it requires a virtual machine to work on Windows and macOS. This adds a
few extra steps to the installation process on these systems, but other than
that, the core functionality remains the same.</p><p>This tutorial assumes that you are using a Debian-based Linux distribution such
as Ubuntu, Mint, or Debian itself. The installation process for other operating
systems is very similar and can be applied by referring to the official
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://podman.io/docs/installation">Podman installation instructions<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>.</p><p>Make sure that you are using a relatively recent version of your preferred
distribution, as PPA repositories on older versions may not have the latest
Podman available for installation. For instance, at the time of this writing,
the latest major version of Podman is <code>4.x</code>, yet the most recent LTS version of
Ubuntu
(<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/jammy-jellyfish-release-notes/24668">Ubuntu 22.04 LTS<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>)
locks you in to Podman <code>3.x</code>. Therefore, this tutorial is based on a newer
non-LTS version
(<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/mantic-minotaur-release-notes/35534">Ubuntu 23.10<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>).</p><p>Start by downloading the latest information from all configured upstream package
sources:</p>

<p>Then run the following command to install Podman:</p>

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This output shows something important. Even though the "Hello World!" image was
built with tools from the Docker ecosystem, Podman was still able to run the
container.</p><p>That's because both Docker and Podman follow the OCI
(<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://opencontainers.org/">Open Container Initiative<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>) standards. The OCI
defines an

enabling different container runtimes, such as Podman and Docker, to
interoperate.</p><p>As a result, Podman can seamlessly work with most Docker images and containers.
This compatibility allows you to migrate your existing workloads to Podman
easily without having to make any modifications and also to leverage the vast
library of Docker images available on Docker Hub.</p><p>Let's further break down the output from the command above. The first line says:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>Resolved "hello-world" as an alias (/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/shortnames.conf)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This message indicates that Podman referenced a configuration file to obtain the
fully qualified name of the <code>hello-world</code> image. Unlike Docker, Podman
recommends against using short names to refer to images and does not default to
a specific registry, unless explicitly instructed to do so via its configuration
files. Docker, on the other hand, always uses Docker Hub (<code>docker.io</code>) as its
default registry and tries to locate every image there when a fully qualified
name is not explicitly provided.</p><p>You can further inspect the <code>shortnames.conf</code> file and confirm that the
<code>hello-world</code> alias maps to the image <code>docker.io/library/hello-world</code>:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>grep hello-world /etc/containers/registries.conf.d/shortnames.conf
</code></pre>
</div>

<div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>"hello-world" = "docker.io/library/hello-world"
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The next few lines say:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>Trying to pull docker.io/library/hello-world:latest...
Getting image source signatures
Copying blob 719385e32844 done
Copying config 9c7a54a9a4 done

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>These messages indicate that the latest version of the <code>hello-world</code> image was
successfully downloaded to your local machine.</p><p>You can verify this by issuing:</p>

<div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>REPOSITORY                     TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED       SIZE

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The remaining output (the "Hello from Docker!" message and all subsequent lines)
display a message that's hard-coded into the
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/docker-library/hello-world/blob/master/hello.c">hello<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>
binary that ships with the <code>hello-world</code> image. This message could be a little
misleading as it suggests that the Docker engine executed the container when, in
reality, Podman did. It's important to understand that neither the Docker client
nor the Docker daemon were in any way involved in the process.</p><p>Before you move on further, remove the <code>hello-world</code> image, as it's no longer
needed:</p>

<p>The output indicates that the image was removed, displaying its tag and ID for
reference:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">

</div>

<p>Next, let's examine what happens when you attempt to run an arbitrary image
using only its short name.</p>
<h2 id="using-short-image-names">Using short image names</h2>
<p>As we discussed previously, Podman suggests using fully-qualified names for
container images to avoid ambiguity and ensure that the correct image is always
referenced from a specific registry.</p><p>Let's try running a container using the
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/caddy">official Caddy image<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a> from Docker Hub. If
you're unfamiliar with <a rel="" target="" href="https://betterstack.com/community/guides/web-servers/caddy/">Caddy</a>, it's a lightweight web server and reverse
proxy known for its ease of use and fantastic performance. By running Caddy as a
container, you can quickly spin up a local web server for testing purposes.</p><p>Coming from a Docker background, you would typically use the following command
to start the container:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>docker run --rm -p 8080:80 caddy
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This translates to the following command in Podman:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman run --rm -p 8080:80 caddy
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Most of the time, transitioning from Docker to Podman is a matter of changing
<code>docker</code> to <code>podman</code> in your command. In fact, many users add
<code>alias docker=podman</code> to their shell config files and use Podman as an alias for
<code>docker</code> commands.</p><p>The flags are also identical:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--rm</code> specifies that the container should be automatically removed after it
exits, so it doesn't clutter up your system.</li>
<li><code>-p 8080:80</code> specifies that port <code>8080</code> on the host machine should map to port
<code>80</code> in the container, so that you can access the web server running inside
the container by typing <code>localhost:8080</code> in your browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try running the command. If everything goes well, a container should launch,
allowing you to open <code>localhost:8080</code> in a browser to see the built-in Caddy
test page.</p><p>Contrary to what you might anticipate, the command fails and returns the
following error:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>Error: short-name "caddy" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in "/etc/containers/registries.conf"
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The command didn't work because Podman couldn't understand where to pull the
<code>caddy</code> image from.</p><p>It first looked up <code>shortnames.conf</code> for an alias named <code>caddy</code> but could not
find one. Try a <code>grep</code> on <code>shortnames.conf</code>, and you will see that it returns no
matches indeed:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>grep caddy /etc/containers/registries.conf.d/shortnames.conf
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It then looked up the <code>registries.conf</code> file for a list of so-called unqualified
search registries. An unqualified search registry is the one that Podman tries
to contact whenever a non-fully qualified image name is supplied with the <code>run</code>
command.</p><p>There are three possible solutions to the issue that you encountered. Let's
explore all of them:</p>
<h3 id="1-specifying-a-fully-qualified-name">1. Specifying a fully-qualified name</h3>
<p>You can specify the fully-qualified name:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman run --rm -p 8080:80 docker.io/library/caddy
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This works! However, coming from a Docker background, you may find using short
names more ergonomic, because this is the workflow that you're used to. This is
absolutely possible with Podman, using either aliases or unqualified search
registries which we'll explore below.</p>
<h3 id="2-defining-an-alias">2. Defining an alias</h3>
<p>You may decide to define an alias for <code>caddy</code> instead. When doing so, keep in
mind that the <code>/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/shortnames.conf</code> file is not
meant to be modified directly, as it is shipped as part of the
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/containers/shortnames">shortnames project<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>. The correct way
to define a new alias is by adding an <code>[aliases]</code> section to your
<code>registries.conf</code> file like this:</p><div data-controller="clipboard">
  <div>
    <p><span>/etc/containers/registries.conf</span></p>
    
    <p>
  <span>Copied!</span>
</p>

  </div>
  <div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="code">
  <pre><code>[aliases]
"caddy"="docker.io/caddy"
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>The default registry configuration for Podman is located at
<code>/etc/containers/registries.conf</code>, but modifying this file requires root
privileges. This slightly defeats the idea of rootless access that Podman aims
to support. However, Podman offers a mechanism to overcome this limitation. You
can put your configuration into <code>$HOME/.config/containers/registries.conf</code>, and
it will take precedence over <code>/etc/containers/registries.conf</code>. This requires no
root privileges.</p><p>Go ahead and create the <code>$HOME/.config/containers/registries.conf</code> file on your
system:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>mkdir -p $HOME/.config/containers &amp;&amp; touch $HOME/.config/containers/registries.conf
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then add the following line to your file:</p><div data-controller="clipboard">
  <div>
    <p><span>~/.config/containers/registries.conf</span></p>
    
    <p>
  <span>Copied!</span>
</p>

  </div>
  <div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="code">
  <pre><code>[aliases]
"caddy"="docker.io/caddy"
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now re-run:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman run --rm -p 8080:80 caddy
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You will see the following output indicating that the solution works:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>Resolved "caddy" as an alias (/home/&lt;your_user_name&gt;/.config/containers/registries.conf)
Trying to pull docker.io/library/caddy:latest...
...
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>While this solution works, adding aliases for every image that you plan on using
will be tedious and time-consuming in the long run. This leads us to the third
possible solution—configuring an unqualified search registry.</p><p>Before you do that, revert the changes that you did so far so you can start with
a clean state.</p><p>Hit <code>Ctrl+C</code> to terminate the Caddy container and return to your terminal. Then
remove the <code>[aliases]</code> configuration from the <code>registries.conf</code> file by
truncating the entire file:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>echo &gt; $HOME/.config/containers/registries.conf
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Remove the <code>caddy</code> image that Podman just downloaded:</p>

<p>As expected, the output shows the tag and ID of the image that was removed:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>Untagged: docker.io/library/caddy:latest
Deleted: 70c3913f54e294079c54cc8b651576b08dd4add42a0f4c0bc93d539913ae335d
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You are now ready to define an unqualified search registry.</p>
<h3 id="3-defining-an-unqualified-search-registry">3. Defining an unqualified search registry</h3>
<p>Open your <code>$HOME/.config/containers/registries.conf</code> file and paste the
following contents:</p><div data-controller="clipboard">
  <div>
    <p><span>~/.config/containers/registries.conf</span></p>
    
    <p>
  <span>Copied!</span>
</p>

  </div>
  <div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="code">
  <pre><code>unqualified-search-registries=["docker.io"]
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now re-run:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman run --rm -p 8080:80 caddy
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You will see the following output:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>Resolving "caddy" using unqualified-search registries (/home/&lt;your_user_name&gt;/.config/containers/registries.conf)

...
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <code>caddy</code> image was successfully downloaded, a container was launched, and
Caddy is now ready to serve web requests.</p><p>To confirm that everything works, you can navigate to <code>localhost:8080</code>. There,
you should see the Caddy test page:</p>
<p>Using an unqualified search registry is unquestionably a better option than
using aliases, especially if you intend to use Podman as a drop-in replacement
for Docker, because you can continue using short names the way that you are used
to, and they will resolve from Docker Hub by default.</p><p>Before you continue further, go back to your terminal and hit <code>Ctrl+C</code> to stop
the container, then remove the Caddy image:</p>

<h2 id="using-private-image-registries">Using private image registries</h2>
<p>You are likely used to working with private registries that host your

a new private repository as follows:</p>
<p>If all goes well, you should see the repository listed in your Docker Hub
account:</p>
<p>Let's now configure Podman to run with your private repository.</p><p>Type the following command:</p>

<p>Here, <code>docker.io</code> can be omitted if you have listed it as the first
<code>unqualified-search-registries</code> entry in your <code>registries.conf</code> file.
Nevertheless, it's still considered a good practice to specify the registry
explicitly.</p><p>Otherwise, <code>podman login</code> will fail with the following error:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>Error: no registries found in registries.conf, a registry must be provided

<p>Now, try running a container using the image from your private repository:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">

<p>As you can see, using Podman with a private registry is almost identical to
using Docker for the same purpose. The only difference is that you prefixed your

<p>With this, you can proceed to the next section and learn how to orchestrate
multiple containers with Podman.</p>
<h2 id="orchestrating-multiple-containers">Orchestrating multiple containers</h2>
<p>So far, you have only been launching one container at a time to explore how
Podman works. At some point, you'll surely find it necessary to run multiple
containers working together as a unit. In this section, you'll explore one of
the possible ways to do that with
<a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/containers/podman-compose">Podman Compose<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>.</p><p>Podman offers several options for orchestrating multiple containers, but Podman
Compose is the most similar to what's used in the Docker world. Other options
are pods and Kubernetes manifests, but both call for a deeper comprehension of
Podman (and Kubernetes), so we'll leave them out for now.</p><p>In the following example, you'll use the Docker Compose instructions supplied

blogging and content management platform written in PHP.</p><p>In the Docker ecosystem, Compose allows you to define and manage multiple
containers through definitions stored inside a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file. Being
used to working with Docker Compose, you can continue using your existing

Podman. It relies on Python 3 to work, and one of the easiest ways to get
started with it is through <a rel="" target="_blank" href="https://pypa.github.io/pipx/">pipx<span><svg style="--currentColor: currentColor;"><use href="https://betterstack.com/assets/icons/heroicons_v2/mini/arrow-top-right-on-square-d4a4b2dfe559997065a0de05c441ef56d661be449bf96d9ce30eb4e0af2516cf.svg#root"></use></svg></span></a>.</p><p>If you don't already have Python 3 or <code>pipx</code> installed on your system, you can
install them by running:</p>

<p>You can verify that <code>pipx</code> is working by typing:</p>

<p>This will output a version identifier similar to:</p>

<p>The output confirms that version <code>1.2.0</code> is of <code>pipx</code> is installed on your

<p>Then, create a new <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file and paste the following contents:</p><div data-controller="clipboard">

</code></pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>Save the file, then run:</p>

<p>Let's examine the output segment by segment.</p><p>Initially, <code>podman-compose</code> launches and starts analyzing the
<code>docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman-compose version: 1.0.6
['podman', '--version', '']
using podman version: 4.3.1
** excluding:  set()
['podman', 'ps', '--filter', 'label=io.podman.compose.project=podman-tutorial', '-a', '--format', '{{ index .Labels "io.podman.compose.config-hash"}}']
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It detects two services named <code>wordpress</code> and <code>db</code>, and starts processing them
in sequential order.</p><p>First, it finds out that the <code>wordpress</code> service requires an external volume. It
tries to locate the volume by issuing <code>podman volume inspect &lt;volume_name&gt;</code>, but
since it doesn't exist, it goes ahead and creates one by issuing
<code>podman volume create &lt;volume_name&gt;</code>:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman volume inspect podman-tutorial_wordpress || podman volume create podman-tutorial_wordpress
['podman', 'volume', 'inspect', 'podman-tutorial_wordpress']
Error: inspecting object: no such volume podman-tutorial_wordpress
['podman', 'volume', 'create', '--label', 'io.podman.compose.project=podman-tutorial', '--label', 'com.docker.compose.project=podman-tutorial', 'podman-tutorial_wordpress']
['podman', 'volume', 'inspect', 'podman-tutorial_wordpress']
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Next, it checks whether there is a suitable network for deploying the
<code>wordpress</code> service. It doesn't find one, so it creates it and then performs
another check to confirm that the network exists:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>['podman', 'network', 'exists', 'podman-tutorial_default']
['podman', 'network', 'create', '--label', 'io.podman.compose.project=podman-tutorial', '--label', 'com.docker.compose.project=podman-tutorial', 'podman-tutorial_default']
['podman', 'network', 'exists', 'podman-tutorial_default']
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Finally, with a suitable network and an external volume in place, Podman Compose
launches the <code>wordpress</code> container:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman run --name=wordpress -d --label io.podman.compose.config-hash=c3e51c9a26e54848a06f92083413698bee90acd721b4aa3054280e110819a68c --label io.podman.compose.project=podman-tutorial --label io.podman.compose.version=1.0.6 --label PODMAN_SYSTEMD_UNIT=podman-compose@podman-tutorial.service --label com.docker.compose.project=podman-tutorial --label com.docker.compose.project.working_dir=/home/&lt;your_user_name&gt;/podman-tutorial --label com.docker.compose.project.config_files=docker-compose.yml --label com.docker.compose.container-number=1 --label com.docker.compose.service=wordpress -e WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=db -e WORDPRESS_DB_USER=testuser -e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=testpass -e WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=testdb -v podman-tutorial_wordpress:/var/www/html --net podman-tutorial_default --network-alias wordpress -p 8080:80 --restart always wordpress
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Since Podman cannot find a <code>wordpress</code> image available locally, it goes ahead
and looks up the unqualified search registry that you configured earlier
(<code>docker.io</code>), then downloads it:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>Resolving "wordpress" using unqualified-search registries (/home/&lt;your_user_name&gt;/.config/containers/registries.conf)

exit code: 0
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Next, Podman Compose proceeds with processing the instructions for the <code>db</code>
service.</p><p>First, it creates its external volume:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman volume inspect podman-tutorial_db || podman volume create podman-tutorial_db
['podman', 'volume', 'inspect', 'podman-tutorial_db']
Error: inspecting object: no such volume podman-tutorial_db
['podman', 'volume', 'create', '--label', 'io.podman.compose.project=podman-tutorial', '--label', 'com.docker.compose.project=podman-tutorial', 'podman-tutorial_db']
['podman', 'volume', 'inspect', 'podman-tutorial_db']
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It then ensures that there is a suitable network for its deployment:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>['podman', 'network', 'exists', 'podman-tutorial_default']
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Finally, it launches the <code>db</code> container:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman run --name=db -d --label io.podman.compose.config-hash=c3e51c9a26e54848a06f92083413698bee90acd721b4aa3054280e110819a68c --label io.podman.compose.project=podman-tutorial --label io.podman.compose.version=1.0.6 --label PODMAN_SYSTEMD_UNIT=podman-compose@podman-tutorial.service --label com.docker.compose.project=podman-tutorial --label com.docker.compose.project.working_dir=/home/&lt;your_user_name&gt;/podman-tutorial --label com.docker.compose.project.config_files=docker-compose.yml --label com.docker.compose.container-number=1 --label com.docker.compose.service=db -e MYSQL_DATABASE=testdb -e MYSQL_USER=testuser -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=testpass -e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=1 -v podman-tutorial_db:/var/lib/mysql --net podman-tutorial_default --network-alias db --restart always mysql:5.7
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Just like with the <code>wordpress</code> image, Podman cannot find a <code>mysql:5.7</code> image
locally, so it goes ahead and obtains it from Docker Hub:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>Resolving "mysql" using unqualified-search registries (/home/&lt;your_user_name&gt;/.config/containers/registries.conf)

exit code: 0
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>At this point, Podman Compose exits successfully, and everything appears to be
launched correctly. Let's go ahead and verify this.</p><p>First, try to open <code>localhost:8080</code> in a browser. You should see the WordPress
installation page:</p>
<p>Now, go back to your terminal and type in:</p>

<p>Indeed, both the <code>wordpress</code> container and the <code>db</code> container are up and
running:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                               COMMAND               CREATED        STATUS            PORTS                 NAMES
980f5792fb9c  docker.io/library/wordpress:latest  apache2-foregroun...  3 minutes ago  Up 3 minutes ago  0.0.0.0:8080-&gt;80/tcp  wordpress
21615c3d3623  docker.io/library/mysql:5.7         mysqld                2 minutes ago  Up 2 minutes ago                        db
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can also go ahead and explore the list of available images:</p>

<p>The list contains all the necessary images for running MySQL and WordPress:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>REPOSITORY                   TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED       SIZE
docker.io/library/wordpress  latest      bc823df9ead2  28 hours ago  683 MB
docker.io/library/mysql      5.7         bdba757bc933  4 weeks ago   520 MB
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can further explore the list of available networks:</p>

<p>Two networks show up:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>NETWORK ID    NAME                     DRIVER
2f259bab93aa  podman                   bridge
3f5fa386b31c  podman-tutorial_default  bridge
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <code>podman</code> network is created by default when you install Podman for the first
time. It is used for launching containers when no other network is explicitly
specified. On the other hand, the <code>podman-tutorial_default</code> network is created
by Podman Compose to isolate the containers defined in your <code>docker-compose.yml</code>
from any other containers potentially running on the same system.</p><p>Finally, let's check the available volumes:</p>

<p>As expected, two external volumes appear:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>DRIVER      VOLUME NAME
local       podman-tutorial_db
local       podman-tutorial_wordpress
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can go ahead and stop the containers:</p>

<p>Podman Compose stops and removes the containers from your system but keeps the
network and volumes:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman-compose version: 1.0.6
['podman', '--version', '']
using podman version: 4.3.1
** excluding:  set()
podman stop -t 10 db
db
exit code: 0
podman stop -t 10 wordpress
wordpress
exit code: 0
podman rm db
db
exit code: 0
podman rm wordpress
wordpress
exit code: 0
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can verify that no containers are running by typing:</p>

<p>The result shows an empty output, which confirms that all of the containers were
stopped and removed.</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>CONTAINER ID  IMAGE       COMMAND     CREATED     STATUS      PORTS       NAMES
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you want to remove the volumes as well, you can type in:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman volume rm podman-tutorial_db podman-tutorial_wordpress
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To remove the network, type in:</p><div data-clipboard-target="content" data-controller="clipboard">
  <pre><code>podman network rm podman-tutorial_default
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As you can see, the commands are identical to what you would normally use with
Docker and Docker Compose. The only noticeable difference is that instead of
<code>docker</code> and <code>docker-compose</code>, you type in <code>podman</code> and <code>podman-compose</code>.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Podman is a capable containerization technology that offers a viable alternative
to Docker for running container workloads. Whether you choose Podman or Docker
depends entirely on your specific needs and preferences. </p><p>Podman can do most of the things that Docker can do, with the added benefit of 
not requiring a daemon running in the background. On top of that, Podman offers 
some features that Docker does not, such as working with Kubernetes manifest 
files and organizing individual containers into pods.</p><p>The final decision is yours. If you require a more lightweight and secure
container management solution, Podman might be a better choice. However, Docker
may be the way to go if you prioritize a robust ecosystem with extensive
community support. Ultimately, both tools offer powerful containerization
capabilities to meet your requirements.</p><p>To explore Podman further, consider visiting the

        <div><p>TOKYO: A domestic flight of Japan's All Nippon Airways returned to its departure airport on Saturday (Jan 13) after a crack was found on the cockpit window of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft midair, a spokesperson for the airline said.</p>

<p>Flight 1182 was en route to Toyama airport but headed back to the Sapporo-New Chitose airport after the crack was found on the outermost of four layers of windows surrounding the cockpit, the spokesperson said, adding there were no injuries reported among the 59 passengers and six crew.</p>

<p>The aircraft was not one of Boeing's 737 MAX 9 airplanes. These have been in the spotlight after <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/alaska-airlines-grounds-boeing-737-max-9-midair-blowout-window-panel-emergency-landing-4029231">a cabin panel broke off</a> a new Alaska Airlines jet in mid-air last week.</p>

<p>"The crack was not something that affected the flight's control or pressurisation," the ANA spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The United States aviation regulator on Friday <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/us-regulator-grounds-boeing-max-9-indefinitely-flights-cancelled-tuesday-4045391">extended the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX 9 airplanes</a> indefinitely for new safety checks and announced it will tighten oversight of Boeing itself.&nbsp;</p></div>

          <p> Thursday, January 11, 2024</p>
    
        
          <div>
        
        <p><strong><em>This information is preliminary and subject to change.</em></strong></p>

<div><p>This incident should have never happened and it cannot happen again. FAA formally notified Boeing that it is conducting an investigation to determine if Boeing failed to ensure completed products conformed to its approved design and were in a condition for safe operation in compliance with FAA regulations. This investigation is a result of an incident on a Boeing Model 737-9 MAX where it lost a “plug” type passenger door and additional discrepancies. Boeing’s manufacturing practices need to comply with the high safety standards they’re legally accountable to meet. <a href="https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/EIR2024NM420001_737MAX9.pdf">The letter is attached.</a></p><p>
&nbsp;
The safety of the flying public, not speed, will determine the timeline for returning the Boeing 737-9 Max to service.&nbsp;</p></div>

<hr><p><br><strong>January 9, 2024</strong></p>

<p>Every Boeing 737-9 Max with a plug door will remain grounded until the FAA finds each can safely return to operation. To begin this process, Boeing must provide instructions to operators for inspections and maintenance. Boeing offered an initial version of instructions yesterday which they are now revising because of feedback received in response. Upon receiving the revised version of instructions from Boeing the FAA will conduct a thorough review.</p>

<p>The safety of the flying public, not speed, will determine the timeline for returning the Boeing 737-9 Max to service.</p>

<hr><p><br><strong>January 8, 2024</strong></p>

<p>The FAA has approved a method to comply with the FAA's Boeing 737-9 <a href="https://drs.faa.gov/browse/excelExternalWindow/DRSDOCID122693486620240106201913.0001">emergency airworthiness directive</a>, and it has been provided to the affected operators.</p>

<p>The FAA’s priority is always keeping Americans safe. In that spirit, Boeing 737-9 aircraft will remain grounded until operators complete enhanced inspections which include both left and right cabin door exit plugs, door components, and fasteners. Operators must also complete corrective action requirements based on findings from the inspections prior to bringing any aircraft back into service.</p>

<p>The FAA will continue to support the National Transportation Safety Board’s investigation into Alaska Airlines Flight 1282. The NTSB is in charge of the investigation and will provide any updates.</p>

<hr><p><br><strong>January 7, 2024</strong></p>

<p>The FAA’s first priority is keeping the flying public safe. We have grounded the affected airplanes, and they will remain grounded until the FAA is satisfied that they are safe.</p>

<hr><p><br><strong>January 6, 2024</strong></p>

<div><p>The FAA ordered the temporary grounding of certain Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft operated by U.S. airlines or in U.S. territory.</p><p>
&nbsp;
“The FAA is requiring immediate inspections of certain Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes before they can return to flight,” FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said. “Safety will continue to drive our decision-making as we assist the NTSB’s investigation into Alaska Airlines Flight 1282.”</p><p>
&nbsp;
The&nbsp;<a href="https://drs.faa.gov/browse/excelExternalWindow/DRSDOCID122693486620240106201913.0001">Emergency Airworthiness Directive (EAD)</a>&nbsp;requires operators to inspect affected aircraft before further flight. The required inspections will take around four to eight hours per aircraft.</p><p>
&nbsp;
The EAD will affect approximately 171 airplanes worldwide.</p></div>

<p>Of course, you can still donate if you want to; it's just no longer "needed-needed".</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/arp242">https://github.com/sponsors/arp242</a></p>
<p>Many thanks,<br>
Martin</p>
<hr>
<p>And then now for the actual changelog:</p>
<p>This release requires Go 1.21.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Quite a few tables are rewritten to a more efficient format. For small to medium instances this will take a few minutes at the most, but if you have very large instances this may take a few hours. It also requires enough free disk space to rewrite the <code>hits</code> table.</p>
<p>If you want to run steps manually then you can view the migration with:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="% goatcounter db migrate -show 2023-05-16-1-hits"><pre><code>% goatcounter db migrate -show 2023-05-16-1-hits
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or if you use PostgreSQL:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="% goatcounter db migrate -show -db postgresql+dbname=goatcounter 2023-05-16-1-hits"><pre><code>% goatcounter db migrate -show -db postgresql+dbname=goatcounter 2023-05-16-1-hits
</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>User-Agent</code> header is no longer stored; only the browser and system parsed out of there. It's pretty reliable, and especially mobile browser User-Agents are ridiculously unique. It was always stored only "in case the detection got it horribly wrong", but this has never been needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add <code>proxy</code> option in <code>serve -tls</code> flag,  to give a hint that a secure connection will be used, so we know what value to use for the cookie secure/samesite flags.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add <em>experimental</em> "dark mode"; this needs to be enabled explicitly in the user settings. I need help to make this decent:<br>
<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1173264126" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/arp242/goatcounter/issues/586" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/arp242/goatcounter/issues/586/hovercard?comment_id=1287995673&amp;comment_type=issue_comment" href="https://github.com/arp242/goatcounter/issues/586#issuecomment-1287995673">#586 (comment)</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show difference of pageviews compared to previous period on the dashboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make setup of a new installation a bit easier: instead of telling people to use the CLI, display a form when the database is 100% empty.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Collecting stats was broken when "sessions" was disabled in the site settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use navigator.sendBeacon by default in count.js. This will allow using click events on things like PDF files and external URLs:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="<a href=&quot;file.pdf&quot; data-goatcounter-event=&quot;file.pdf&quot;>
<a href=&quot;http://example.com&quot; data-goatcounter-event=&quot;ext-example.com&quot;>"><pre><code>&lt;a href="file.pdf" data-goatcounter-event="file.pdf"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://example.com" data-goatcounter-event="ext-example.com"&gt;
</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes the order of pages was wrong when using PostgreSQL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Few smaller bugfixes.</p>
</li>
</ul></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>I often hear agency talked about as if it’s an inherent trait: Either someone has it or they don’t -- in which case, too bad, they’re doomed to a life in the minor leagues. This hasn’t been my experience. Over the years, as I’ve gradually grown dumber relative to my peers through a combination of aging and making smarter friends, one of the main ways I’ve compensated has been through dialing up my agency, which I think of as something like “manifest determination to make things happen.”</p><p>As a result, I’ve done a bunch of cool stuff in different domains: I was a Supreme Court advocate and the number one female poker player in the world; started art and perfume companies; and led operations at Alvea, a pandemic medicine company I co-founded, when it set the record for the fastest startup to take a drug to clinical trials. All of these things I did in my 30s.</p><p><span>In my way of thinking, radical agency is about finding real edges: things you are willing to do that others aren’t, often because they’re annoying or unpleasant. These don’t always surface in awareness to the point one is actually </span><em>choosing</em><span> -- often they live in a cloud of aversion that strategically obscures the tradeoff.</span></p><p>The idea of finding real edges, as contrasted with “eking out wins by grinding harder than everyone,” first clicked for me when I started playing poker. Poker in the modern era is an extraordinarily competitive game, and even 8 years ago pros were spending nearly as much time studying as they were playing, using solver models to seek out tiny mathematical advantages. At the same time, a massive edge was available in the form of physical reads, but almost entirely ignored. (I know an example would make this more compelling, but I’m sorry, it’s like explaining a magic trick.)</p><p>Two friends and I maniacally studied reads together, and we all had out-of-distribution results. But when we’d tell other pros what we were doing, the response from most was “nuh-uh, that’s not a thing.” They weren’t willing to consider the possibility that reads were valuable, maybe because they didn’t want to feel obligated to study them.</p><p>All of my agency hacks are kind of like this, in my opinion -- big, glaring edges that people might rather ignore.</p><p><span>Ask for things. Ask for things that feel </span><em>unreasonable</em><span>, to make sure your intuitions about what’s reasonable are accurate (of course, try not to be a jerk in the process). If you’re only asking for things you get, you’re not aiming high enough. Jobs are a great example: Particularly if you’re early in your career, you should aim to get rejected from most things you apply for. If you have not yet learned the skill of absorbing rejection, </span><a href="https://youtu.be/-vZXgApsPCQ?si=Rj0FbacsSp34a-W2" rel="">court it deliberately</a><span>: Apply for some jobs you </span><em>really </em><span>don’t think you’ll get so you can learn to decouple “no” from surprise and dejection.</span></p><p>I sent an email recently that I wouldn’t have dared try a few years ago, something along the lines of “I’m planning to start an organization similar to yours; would you consider letting me run yours instead?” The response? Crickets. Maybe that person thinks I overstepped. But it doesn’t matter, because a similar pitch delivered to someone else put us on a path to start a new organization together, something much cooler than I could have managed on my own.</p><p>It’s hard to overstate how overpowered this one is. If you aren’t trying to get real feedback from people who know you, you’re cooking without tasting. This is, like, the lowest hanging fruit for self-improvement, but few people really try to pick it.</p><p><span>In many contexts, the way to get good feedback is to give people a way to provide it anonymously. Anything else creates friction by layering on social dynamics. To get honest feedback, you want to make it as comfortable as possible for people to give it. You also want to make it easy to find -- I have a </span><a href="http://shorturl.at/vxF24" rel="">link to my feedback form</a><span> in my Twitter bio, and get a few comments a week through it.</span></p><p><span>I imagine resistance from some people on the grounds that anonymity frees people to be assholes, but in my experience they rarely are. 90% of what I get in my inbox is either nonsense or nice -- I get lots of “keep up the good work!” type messages. In over a year, I’ve gotten maybe two messages intended to hurt my feelings. Once in a while, I get a message that’s a gut punch because it calls my attention to a real issue -- but then I get over it and get to work fixing the issue. (I wish people gave me </span><em>more</em><span> feedback -- I had to learn about my uptalk from YouTube comments.)</span></p><p>The last couple times I was looking for a project, I made a point of meeting as many people doing related work as I could, even if there was no obvious benefit to doing so. At first, I did this just to advertise my existence to people as I entered a new field, because someone is always hiring or looking for a cofounder.</p><p>What I discovered by casting a wide net was that I have very little ability to predict how useful a call will be in advance. Relevance is easier to predict, but it’s not a very good proxy for usefulness, which is a product of lots of other things including the other person’s enthusiasm and the breadth of their interests. To some extent, the more confident I am that a conversation is relevant, the less likely I am to discover something exciting during it. Nearly all of my most fruitful collaborations over the last 3 years have come out of meetings I booked almost at random. My best conversation last week was with someone where the introducer told me “this person asked for an introduction but I’m not sure it’s a good use of your time.”</p><p>Most subject matter is learnable, even stuff that seems really hard. But beyond that, many (most?) traits that people treat as fixed are actually quite malleable if you (1) believe they are and (2) put the same kind of work into learning them as you would anything else.&nbsp;</p><p>As you might gather, I think agency itself is a good example. I learned agency late. In my teens and 20s, I occasionally made agent-y moves (like taking a job in a new city to be with someone I hadn’t spoken to yet; we married a few months later). But I still managed to pick a career I really disliked, for no reason other than its obviousness, and only after a decade stopped to ask what I was hoping to accomplish.</p><p>Many other supposedly fixed traits can likewise be altered. Some other things you can learn: confidence, charisma, warmth, tranquility, optimism. Someone recently asked me how one might go about learning charisma, and the answer was really boring: by reading a few books, watching many hours of charismatic people interacting with others, and adopting a few of their habits. This is surely a plan of action most people could come up with if they didn’t have the notion that charisma is innate lodged in their heads.</p><p>Whatever it is, assume it can be learned and that the task is to figure out the best way to do it.</p><p><span>The moat of low status is one of my favorite concepts, </span><a href="https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/the-moat-of-low-status-68a" rel="">courtesy of my husband Sasha</a><span>. The idea is that making changes in your life, especially when learning new skill sets, requires you to cross a moat of low status, a period of time where you are actually bad at the thing or fail to know things that are obvious to other people.</span></p><p><span>It’s called a moat both because you can’t just leap to the other side and because it gives anyone who can cross it a real advantage. It’s</span><em> </em><span>possible to cross the moat quietly, by not asking questions and not collaborating, but those tradeoffs really nerf learning. “Learn by doing” is standard advice, but you can’t do that unless you splash around in the moat for a bit.</span></p><p><span>If you can learn to thrive in the moat, it’s incredibly liberating. I once played a hand in a big poker tournament so badly there were </span><a href="https://www.worldpokertour.com/live_update/cate-hall-returns-to-wpt-five-diamond-discusses-ups-down-and-plans-should-she-reach-final-table-main-tour-wpt-five-diamond-world-poker-classic-season-2017-2018-1-25100-200/" rel="">news stories</a><span> about it. I’ll never </span><em>entirely</em><span> get over my embarrassment about the hand, but I still look back on it with great fondness, because it’s when I realized I’d crossed some threshold of unflappability. With cameras and reporters crowding around, I could have safely folded and no one would have paid attention; I chose to call knowing it would mean certain ridicule even if I won. The call was in fact quite bad, but I made it for the</span><em> right</em><span> wrong reason.</span></p><p><span>This might be the most important item on the list. It took me almost 40 years to learn it, because my instinct is to think more hours mean more productivity as long as you’re really </span><em>trying </em><span>to be productive -- that’s just multiplication, right? No. The reality is that grinding, even if it temporarily increases output, kills creativity and big picture thinking.</span></p><p>Burnout is the ultimate agency-killer. This is so true that I’ve learned to identify a reduction in agency as one of the first signs of burnout, one that shows up even before I consciously realize what’s happening. A switch flips and I start looking for ways to rule out ideas and actions, to conclude they won’t work or aren’t necessary, rather than chasing better versions.</p><p>These days I set boundaries that would have made me ashamed at earlier points in my life: I’m offline at 6 p.m. almost every night, and rigorously observe a Sunday Sabbath where nothing with the flavor of effort is tolerated. These will seem like small things to some people, but like a mortal sin to others in the communities I run in.</p><p>My rule is never to take instructions on how hard I should work from someone who hasn’t burned out before. Very few people take this seriously enough.</p><p>Agency is the skill that built the world around you, an all-purpose life intensifier that lets you make your corner of it more like what you want it to be, whether that’s professional, relational, aesthetic, whatever. Build a better mousetrap. Have an enviable marriage. Start a country. No one is born with it, everyone can learn it, and it’s never too late.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has shown to occasionally not act on community feedback and bug reports. A story about a decade old bug. <a href="https://pixel.freudenjmp.com/no-user-logon.png"><img src="https://pixel.freudenjmp.com/no-user-logon.png" alt="" width="1" height="1" loading="lazy"></a></p><h4 id="tldr"><span>tl;dr</span><a href="#tldr"><i></i></a></h4><p>To fix the infamous <code>No user logon</code> issue in Counter-Strike that exists for over a decade, here are a few popular mitigations that do absolutely jack shit to fix the root cause.

Recently, Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) has been published and <em>replaced</em> (!) its predecessor Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). Some people tend to not consider CS2 a game but one big bug. While this is maybe a bit harsh, it’s not far from the truth:</p><ul><li>You could <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/5484883079143170845?l=english">teleport yourself to any location on the map</a></li><li>You could <a href="https://youtu.be/j9g6F5IopJc">overcome physical limitations</a></li><li>You could <a href="https://dotesports.com/counter-strike/news/valve-quietly-fixes-major-cs2-security-exploit-but-disables-useful-feature-in-the-process">abuse a bug to inject code to other players</a></li><li>You could be banned by <a href="https://twitter.com/CounterStrike/status/1712875606776729832">specific settings in your AMD graphics driver</a> or by <a href="https://dotesports.com/counter-strike/news/valve-appears-to-undo-false-vac-bans-for-windows-7-cs2-players">playing on Windows 7</a></li><li>Countless <a href="https://notes.thour.cz/">other bugs</a> that are small in itself but are causing bad gaming experience when combined</li></ul><p>Be prepared for new bugs appearing, as Valve didn’t manage to include CS2 in <a href="https://hackerone.com/valve">Valves HackerOne bug bounty program</a>. <code>cs2.exe</code> is not in scope and the only (outdated) mention of CS2 is inside their description. This means that Valve is not paying for bug reports related to CS2.</p><blockquote><p>Effective 6/14/2023 10 AM PDT, CS:GO is out-of-scope for new reports. Reports for CS2 Limited Test are currently out-of-scope.</p></blockquote><p>However, this of course didn’t stop us from reporting bugs to Valve via e-mail. I hope you are not surprised to learn that these bugs haven’t been fixed nor did they bother to reply. We have at least one critical zero-day that compromises the competitive integrity of the game which is yet under the <a href="https://versprite.com/blog/what-is-responsible-disclosure/">industry-standard 90-day responsible disclosure time frame</a>.</p><p>Notable is that CS2 <em>replaced</em> CS:GO on September 27, 2023, which is a novum. This means CS:GO can’t be played anymore by the average user. Such a hard cutoff date is a new level of “<em>forcing things on the community they maybe don’t like</em>”. Gamers and platforms such as my employer <a href="https://esportal.com/">Esportal</a> were suddenly forced to use CS2.</p><p>It’s not as if I never worked around bugs or needed to fix them on my own in CS:S or CS:GO. It is fine to a degree and expected as no software is bug free. But the amount of bugs in CS2 sets a new standard in a negative way. Especially bugs that are only relevant to community servers which Valve cares even less about.</p><p>Since middle of 2023, when CS2 release was apparent and we started to prepare support for it on Esportal, my working days look like this:</p><pre><code>journey

While the problem was not significant usually it was a constant companion that cost us several days to debug and mitigate it if one counts all the efforts made in the past.

We didn’t see any reports from our users and we didn’t see any occurrences in our logs. We were happy until the first week of January 2024 when we observed an increase of user reports related to this issue compared to all reports:</p><pre><code>xychart-beta

Now they are concentrated in a specific time frame.</p><p>We could confirm that players world wide are facing the issue outside of Esportal and thought it indeed is caused by some maintenance in the middle of the night in Washington.</p><p>Though I was thinking “I looked into this bug a hundred times already without a meaningful result” we were now incentivized to fix it once and for all given the significance of the problem and the volume of tickets.</p><h2 id="the-symptoms"><span>The symptoms</span><a href="#the-symptoms"><i></i></a></h2><p>The observed <code>No user logon</code> errors happened 2-3 minutes after the player connected to the game.

Was this the missing piece of the puzzle? The one information that was required to connect the dots which wasn’t apparent for years? I felt like I was in the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/">Inception</a> and my colleague being <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000138/">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> incepting an idea into my head.</p><p>It is well-known that Valve is sensitive when it comes to skins in their games. They make substantial amount of money with skins. So what if individual skins are not shown until maybe, just maybe, the player owning the skin has been properly authorized by Steam? This would make sure people can’t spoof their identity on the gameserver and use skins they don’t own.</p><h2 id="validation-of-the-hypothesis"><span>Validation of the hypothesis</span><a href="#validation-of-the-hypothesis"><i></i></a></h2><p>I picked a random match where a report came in. Matches are played 5vs5, so 10 players connect to a gameserver in total. Looking at the gameserver logs and applying proper filtering I was able to immediately see something that supports the hypothesis: <code>STEAM USERID validated</code> for a given user who didn’t have issues with <code>No user logon</code> appeared roughly 1min20s after the user connected. Example with user <code>Alice</code>:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

17:17:32: "Alice&lt;1&gt;&lt;CT&gt;" disconnected (reason "NETWORK_DISCONNECT_DISCONNECT_BY_USER")
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>In older logs before 3rd of January the Steam validation always finished within 2-3 seconds after connection instead.</p><p>I tested myself and indeed: missing skins were only a thing during night time in Washington. I was able to reproduce the issue by connecting to a gameserver at 5 AM Washington time. I was not able to reproduce the issue during the Washington daytime.</p><blockquote><p>Hypothesis that <code>No user logon</code> and no skins are connected is now confirmed.</p></blockquote><h2 id="network_disconnect_steam_logon"><span>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON</span><a href="#network_disconnect_steam_logon"><i></i></a></h2><p>Now it is apparent this issue has something to do with Steam validation. But what exactly is the bug? Coming back to the logs of the match I picked I now looked at user <code>Bob</code> who reported <code>No user logon</code> issues:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

It’s an internal identifiers of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_2">Source 2 engine</a> which CS2 is using. The prefix <code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_</code> is used to separate these identifiers from others in the engine.</p><p><code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_EXITING</code> is a valid disconnect reason tells us the user closed their CS2 game while being connected to the gameserver. Another natural reason would be <code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_DISCONNECT_BY_USER</code> which means the user disconnected from the gameserver by themselves without closing their CS2 game.</p><p>Looking at the events before the Steam validation was successful, four disconnections are apparent with two different reasons:</p><ul><li><code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_LOOPSHUTDOWN</code></li><li><code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON</code></li></ul><p>I can reasonably assume the message <code>No user logon</code> is the human translation of the identifier <code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON</code>, so I started looking into this first. Interesting is that <code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON</code> is an immediate consequence of <code>STEAMAUTH: Client Bob received failure code 8</code>. What does it mean though? To find out, I searched for the string <code>STEAMAUTH:</code> in the binary file that is providing the core of the Source 2 engine, <code>libengine2.so</code>:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>$ grep -a "STEAMAUTH:" engine2.so
-insecure-insecure_forced_by_launchersystem/networkSTEAMAUTH: Client %s received failure code %d
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>The last part of the match is interesting: <code>STEAMAUTH: Client %s received failure code %d</code>. As I confirmed this string is in <code>libengine2.dll</code>, I opened the file in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering">reverse engineering</a> tool, searched for the same string again and found the function which is referencing the string. This helps me to understand the context of the string and what it is used for.</p><p>A little trick that comes handy when looking at Counter-Strike is the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-counter-strike-source-code-leak-no-danger">CS:GO source code leak</a>. The same string appears in the file <a href="https://github.com/perilouswithadollarsign/cstrike15_src/blob/f82112a2388b841d72cb62ca48ab1846dfcc11c8/engine/sv_steamauth.cpp#L792">sv_steamauth.cpp on line 792</a>. Utilizing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompiler">decompiler</a> I was able to get pseudo C code that reflects what the function is doing in CS2. Combining the information from the source code leak and the reverse engineering tool I was able to understand the context of the string and what it is used for. The functions look nearly identical in both versions of Counter-Strike, but not 100%. Here is what the properly readable code for CS2 looks like:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Leaving other cases aside as I am only interested in failure code <code>8</code> at the moment, this function disconnects the user from the gameserver with the beloved <code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON</code> reason. It happens when something called <code>CSteamServer3</code> tells us that the <code>eAuthSessionResponse</code> is one of:</p><ul><li><code>k_EAuthSessionResponseUserNotConnectedToSteam</code> (maps to <code>1</code>)</li><li><code>k_EAuthSessionResponseAuthTicketInvalidAlreadyUsed</code> (maps to <code>7</code>)</li><li><code>k_EAuthSessionResponseAuthTicketInvalid</code> (maps to <code>8</code>)</li></ul><h2 id="steam3-validation"><span>Steam3 validation:</span><a href="#steam3-validation"><i></i></a></h2><p>So… what is <code>CSteamServer3</code>? I don’t know for sure but I can deduce from what I learned looking at the leaked CS:GO source code. Saving you from following me through the jungle of C++ classes and functions, here is what I found out as diagram followed by a textual explanation:</p><pre><code>sequenceDiagram
  box User computer
    participant CS2.exe
  end
  box Internet
    participant Gameserver
    participant Steam3 server
  end
  CS2.exe-&gt;&gt;Gameserver: Connect with untrusted Steam ID
  Gameserver-&gt;&gt;Steam3 server: Is that Steam ID valid?
  Note over CS2.exe: Can continue playing&lt;br/&gt; while the validation&lt;br/&gt;with Steam3 is pending
  alt
    Steam3 server-&gt;&gt;Gameserver: yes
    Gameserver-&gt;&gt;CS2.exe: Assign skins, trust user
  else
    Steam3 server-&gt;&gt;Gameserver: no
    Gameserver-&gt;&gt;CS2.exe: Disconnect with "No user logon"
  end
</code></pre><p>Steam3 server is likely responsible for authenticating users. It is not the same as the Steam client that you are using to play games. It is also not the same as the Steam servers that are responsible for matchmaking and other things. It is a separate thing. Think: it makes sure to proof that you are who you are claiming to be and that you own the game you are trying to play.</p><p>When connecting to a gameserver, your game (<code>CS2.exe</code>) tells the gameserver what your Steam ID is. As you could be a bad person, you could modify the game and tell the gameserver that your Steam ID is <code>STEAM_0:0:0</code> instead. That would be the Steam ID of the first Steam account ever created. The gameserver has no way to know at this point whether your information is correct or not. This is where the Steam3 server comes into play. The gameserver asks the Steam3 server if the Steam ID is valid and whether you own the game.</p><p>Note that while the gameserver is waiting for the response, you can continually playing normally on the gameserver, but without skins.</p><p>If the Steam3 server says <code>yes</code>, the gameserver starts trusting that information. It can now do interesting stuff with it, like starting to assign your personal skins to you. This would be the moment where you and others can see your skins.</p><p>And now we know what is likely happening in Washington at night between 4 and 8 AM: the Steam3 server is doing maintenance or is very slow to respond for other reasons. As we learned, that “slowness” is currently roughly 1min20s.</p><p>If the Steam3 server says <code>no</code> instead, the gameserver knows that you (or your game) is lying and disconnects you with <code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON</code>. Looking at the logs from the match, the disconnect happens 2min50s seconds after the user connected to the gameserver. This is why users report the <code>No user logon</code> message appears after 2-3 minutes. This is a reasonable timeframe because in networks it’s always a good idea to have enough leeway for possible issues. It’s better to wait a bit longer than to disconnect too early.</p><h2 id="making-it-trustable"><span>Making it trustable</span><a href="#making-it-trustable"><i></i></a></h2><p>The above scenario is not fully complete, though. It imposes one problem: it only guarantees that the Steam ID told to the gameserver is valid and owns the game. It does <em>not</em> proof that the instance of <code>CS2.exe</code> that connected to the gameserver is actually the one belonging to the signed in Steam account running on the same machine via <code>Steam.exe</code>. So what is needed is a way to proof that <code>CS2.exe</code> is actually trustable.</p><p>This can be achieved by ensuring that <code>CS2.exe</code> can initiate a connection to Steam3 via <code>Steam.exe</code> running on the same machine. As <code>Steam.exe</code> as the Steam client knows the account which is currently signed in, it compares the Steam ID sent by <code>CS2.exe</code> to it. If they match, <code>Steam.exe</code> tells the Steam3 server that the Steam ID is valid for <code>CS2.exe</code>. If it can’t match them, it doesn’t tell the Steam3 server about it.</p><pre><code>sequenceDiagram

</code></pre><blockquote><p>Learning: In reality though, the answer <code>no</code> is too simple. Deducing from above, it can be reasonably assumed that the answer <code>k_EAuthSessionResponseAuthTicketInvalid</code> (which maps to <code>8</code>) is the one we see in the logs for a failed Steam3 validation: <code>STEAMAUTH: Client Bob received failure code 8</code>.</p></blockquote><p>Reasons why Steam3 server could answer <code>no</code> are for example:</p><ol><li>Steam3 is broken and answers wrong things: unlikely, even Valve can be trusted to get this right</li><li>Steam3 server is under maintenance: unlikely, as other users can connect</li><li>The Steam ID is not valid: unlikely, usually our players are trustworthy</li><li>The Steam ID is valid but the instance of <code>CS2.exe</code> is not trustable: likely</li><li>Steam3 server doesn’t know about the Steam ID for this <code>CS2.exe</code> instance: likely</li></ol><p>Aha!

This is a feature of the game and it happens automatically after 5 seconds to retry the connection, hence the multiple connection attempts visible in the gameserver logs.</p><p>Again: why are some users getting disconnected with <code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_LOOPSHUTDOWN</code> while others aren’t?</p><h2 id="loops-in-the-source-engine"><span>Loops in the Source engine</span><a href="#loops-in-the-source-engine"><i></i></a></h2><p>A loop in terms of software engineering is something that is executed until a specific goal is reached.</p><p>The Source engine has one active loop at a time. When <code>CS2.exe</code> starts, it is started with an active loop. A loop processes things in the background, waits until they are finished and once they are finished, invokes the next loop. A loop can run for a very long time, for example the <code>game</code> loop runs as long as you are playing. A loop can be shutdown in case something goes wrong.</p><p>In this example, a the <code>levelload_loop</code> is executed until the level, materials and physics engine are loaded. Once they are loaded, the <code>levelload_loop</code> is considered finished and it executes the <code>game_loop</code>:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

This means that the first disconnection is initiated by <code>CS2.exe</code> because some loop is shutdown. The user is not disconnected by the gameserver, but by themselves.</p><p>No wonder the root cause hasn’t been found in so many years: it’s not a bug in the gameserver, it’s a bug in the game.</p><p><a href="https://blog.freudenjmp.com/assets/img/posts/no-user-logon/ohne-pixel-wasss.gif"><img src="https://blog.freudenjmp.com/assets/img/posts/no-user-logon/ohne-pixel-wasss.gif" alt="WASSS" width="220" height="220" loading="lazy"></a> <em>Me at that very moment: the famous “WASSS” by twitch streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ohnepixel">ohnePixel</a><br>The 175+ shows his and my heartbeat rate because I searched at the wrong place for years</em></p><p>So the search of the root cause has to continue in <code>CS2.exe</code> and not on the gameserver side.</p><blockquote><p>Learning: the first disconnection before a <code>No user logon</code> comes from <code>CS2.exe</code> and not from the gameserver.</p></blockquote><h2 id="cs2-startup-procedure"><span>CS2 startup procedure</span><a href="#cs2-startup-procedure"><i></i></a></h2><p>When <code>CS2.exe</code> is started it executes various loops from the Source engine. The final loop is the <code>game</code> loop which is responsible for the actual menu interaction, user interaction and gameplay. It is <em>the</em> loop that is running as long as the game is fully loaded and/or you are playing.</p><p>As <code>game</code> is the final loop it can’t be the one which is shutdown and so it can’t be the one initiating the disconnection with <code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_LOOPSHUTDOWN</code> as otherwise the game would end. To find out which loops are executed before the <code>game</code> loop, I decided to look at the output of the game console of <code>CS2.exe</code> which can be enabled in the game settings.</p><p>Among a lot of other things, the following can be observed:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>It appears there is a loop <code>levelload</code> (look at <code>CLoopModeLevelLoad</code>) which is executed before the <code>game</code> loop. In the end, that loop wants to transition to the <code>game</code> loop. And <em>directly</em> before that transition it says <code>AuthStatus (steamid:&lt;redacted&gt;): OK (OK)</code>. So the last thing that happens before the <code>game</code> loop is started is that the Steam ID validation is initiated.</p><p>It all makes sense: <code>levelload</code> is called on startup of <code>CS2.exe</code>. While it’s not loading an actual map you are playing on, the initial screen you see in CS2 is likely considered a level too and initializing things like the intro video and the main menu. And while that initial screen is loaded in <code>levelload</code> it tries to initiate the validation with Steam3 via <code>Steam.exe</code>.</p><blockquote><p>Learning: <code>levelload</code> is an important initialization loop and is, among other things, responsible to initiate the validation with Steam3 via <code>Steam.exe</code> from <code>CS2.exe</code> as the <strong>last thing</strong> this loop does.</p></blockquote><p>The updated diagram with these learnings looks a bit different now. Note that <code>CS2.exe</code> is only considered the “initiator” of the <code>levelload</code> and all the game logic that was previously assigned to <code>CS2.exe</code> is taken over by the <code>game</code> loop:</p><pre><code>sequenceDiagram

The game can’t be considered to be in a usable state when it fails to complete.</p><blockquote><p>Learning: When the initialization of <code>levelload</code> is incomplete (speak: CS2 has not been fully loaded/initialized), the Steam3 validation is never initiated because it is the last thing that loop wants to do. This <code>CS2.exe</code> is now broken and can’t be fixed until a simple restart of <code>CS2.exe</code>.</p></blockquote><p>Putting everything together, the bug is now apparent:</p><blockquote><p><code>NETWORK_DISCONNECT_LOOPSHUTDOWN</code> is caused by premature shutdown of <code>levelload</code> without initiating the Steam3 validation. Because <code>levelload</code> detects the premature shutdown, it disconnects the user from the gameserver every time a reconnection is tested.</p></blockquote><p>The diagram looks like this when the bug is triggered:</p><pre><code>sequenceDiagram

    <p><em>The tool instructions in this article are not up to date as of 1/11/2024, see <a href="https://dmicz.github.io/machine-learning/chatgpt-election-update">this post</a> to learn more about the new tool OpenAI added to block conversations about U.S. elections using function calls.</em></p>

<p>GPT-4’s browsing capabilities have been drastically changed in the past weeks due to recent changes pushed by OpenAI.</p>

      <td><em>With recent changes, GPT-4 struggles to cite websites it visited.</em></td>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Recent changes made to GPT-4 significantly altered the model’s web browsing tools, preventing it from directly citing quotes from webpages and limiting viewing of full content. This analysis explores the underlying mechanism of GPT-4 web browsing, the hidden changes, and their implications.</p>

<p><em>If you’re familiar with OpenAI’s function calling API, you may want to skip to <a href="#exposing-function-calls">how I discovered GPT-4’s functions</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="function-calling-in-gpt-4">Function Calling in GPT-4</h2>

<p>In July 2023, OpenAI introduced <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling">function calling</a> in its API, allowing users to describe a function that a GPT model can choose to call, filling out a JSON object with the function parameters. The developer can then give data back to the model once your program calls an API, extracts data from a database, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong> (using <code>gpt-4-1106-preview</code>)</p>

<ul>
  <li>A developer decides to define a function <code>get_weather(location: string, unit: 'celsius' | 'fahrenheit')</code> and passes this to the OpenAI API to create an assistant that can use the function.</li>
  <li>The developer then defines how the model should use the function in the system instructions for the model.</li>
  <li>When a user uses the defined assistant, the model will try to call <code>get_weather</code> when appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code>USER: I'd like to know the weather forecast for my area.

ASSISTANT: Sure, I can provide you with the weather forecast. Could you please 
tell me your location (city and state) and whether you prefer the temperature 
in Celsius or Fahrenheit?

USER: I am in Philadelphia.

ASSISTANT: Great, thank you for providing your location. Now, could you please 
let me know whether you prefer the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit?

USER: I'd actually like the forecast for Springfield, in Celsius.

ASSISTANT: Since you've mentioned Springfield, could you please specify which 
state the Springfield you're referring to is located in, as there are several 
cities with that name across the United States?

USER: Springfield, PA

ASSISTANT: 

FUNCTION CALL: 
get_weather({"location": "Springfield, PA", "unit": "c"})

RESPONSE:
{
  "location": "Springfield, PA",
  "forecast": [
    {
      "date": "2024-01-10",
      "condition": "Sunny",
      "temperature": {
        "high": 8,
        "low": -1
      }
    },
    {
      "date": "2024-01-11",
...

ASSISTANT: Here is the weather forecast for Springfield, PA, in Celsius:

- January 10, 2024: Sunny with high temperatures reaching up to 8°C and lows around -1°C.
...
</code></pre></div>

<p>As seen above, the model makes an effort to correctly get data from the user before calling the function and interpreting the response. GPT-4 appears to do this much better than GPT-3.5, with GPT-3.5 failing to pick up on the potential problems with using location Springfield (there are several cities named Springfield, the model simply used <code>"location" : "Springfield"</code> even though it was told to return a city and state) and failing to ask for the unit of temperature, even when it was set as a required parameter through the API.</p>

<p>Why is this important? Firstly, it’s a very powerful feature that moves us closer to integrating programmed features with natural language, letting users make verbal requests that can then be interpreted as API calls or database queries. And, if you’ve used code generation, image generation, or web browsing with GPT-4, you’ve already made use of function calling.</p>

<h2 id="exposing-function-calls">Exposing Function Calls</h2>

<p>ChatGPT Plus users are able to generate and execute Python code, pass URLs or search queries for GPT-4 to explore, or generate images with DALL-E 3 thanks to function calls.</p>

<p><em>GPT-4 is able to generate images and execute code.</em></p>

<p>I accidentally uncovered more of what goes on when probing both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with empty prompts:</p>

<p><img src="https://dmicz.github.io/assets/img/openai-changes/empty-prompt.png" alt="GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 responding to empty prompts"></p>

<p>Both screenshots are from newly started conversations, implying that there is something written before the GPT-4 conversation in ChatGPT, which led to further investigation:</p>

<p><img src="https://dmicz.github.io/assets/img/openai-changes/invoke-prompt.png" alt="GPT-4 repeats earlier prompt, stating &quot;invoke the dalle tool like this&quot;"></p>

<p>Interesting… although it was hard for me to reproduce this afterwards with the same prompt, I was then able to get ChatGPT to produce more:</p>

<p>The full text GPT-4 then produced (as of 1/10/2024) is below.</p>

    <p>// Whenever a description of an image is given, create a prompt that dalle can use to generate the image and abide to the following policy:</p>

    <p>// 1. The prompt must be in English. Translate to English if needed.</p>

    <p>// 2. DO NOT ask for permission to generate the image, just do it!</p>

    <p>// 3. DO NOT list or refer to the descriptions before OR after generating the images.</p>

    <p>// 4. Do not create more than 1 image, even if the user requests more.</p>

    <p>// 5. Do not create images in the style of artists, creative professionals or studios whose latest work was created after 1912 (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo).</p>

    <p>// - You can name artists, creative professionals or studios in prompts only if their latest work was created prior to 1912 (e.g. Van Gogh, Goya)</p>

    <p>// - If asked to generate an image that would violate this policy, instead apply the following procedure: (a) substitute the artist’s name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style; (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; and (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist</p>

    <p>// 6. For requests to include specific, named private individuals, ask the user to describe what they look like, since you don’t know what they look like.</p>

    <p>// 7. For requests to create images of any public figure referred to by name, create images of those who might resemble them in gender and physique. But they shouldn’t look like them. If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it.</p>

    <p>// 8. Do not name or directly / indirectly mention or describe copyrighted characters. Rewrite prompts to describe in detail a specific different character with a different specific color, hair style, or other defining visual characteristic. Do not discuss copyright policies in responses.</p>

    <p>The generated prompt sent to dalle should be very detailed, and around 100 words long.</p>

    <h2 id="browser">browser</h2>

    <p>You have the tool <code>browser</code>. Use <code>browser</code> in the following circumstances:
    - User is asking about current events or something that requires real-time information (weather, sports scores, etc.)
    - User is asking about some term you are totally unfamiliar with (it might be new)
    - User explicitly asks you to browse or provide links to references</p>

    <p>Given a query that requires retrieval, your turn will consist of three steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Call the search function to get a list of results.</li>
      <li>Call the mclick function to retrieve a diverse and high-quality subset of these results (in parallel). Remember to SELECT AT LEAST 3 sources when using <code>mclick</code>.</li>
      <li>Write a response to the user based on these results. Cite sources using the citation format below.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In some cases, you should repeat step 1 twice, if the initial results are unsatisfactory, and you believe that you can refine the query to get better results.</p>

    <p>You can also open a url directly if one is provided by the user. Only use this command for this purpose; do not open urls returned by the search function or found on webpages.</p>

    <p>The <code>browser</code> tool has the following commands:
	<code>search(query: str, recency_days: int)</code> Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results.
	<code>mclick(ids: list[str])</code>. Retrieves the contents of the webpages with provided IDs (indices). You should ALWAYS SELECT AT LEAST 3 and at most 10 pages. Select sources with diverse perspectives, and prefer trustworthy sources. Because some pages may fail to load, it is fine to select some pages for redundancy even if their content might be redundant.
	<code>open_url(url: str)</code> Opens the given URL and displays it.</p>

    <p>For citing quotes from the ‘browser’ tool: please render in this format: 【{message idx}†{link text}】.
For long citations: please render in this format: <code>[link text](message idx)</code>.
Otherwise do not render links.</p>

</details>

<p>What’s the takeaway from this? It turns out we can learn a lot about ChatGPT’s capabilities from this text. We can also see the mechanism of how OpenAI put copyright protections in place for DALL-E image generation and the usage requirements for the browsing tools.</p>

<p>ChatGPT’s browsing tools currently consist of <code>search</code> (find Bing search results), <code>mclick</code> (to retrieve contents of search results), and <code>open_url</code> (to open any URL, intended for user provided websites), but this hasn’t always been the case.</p>

<h2 id="openais-update">OpenAI’s Update</h2>

<p>Previously I’ve been experimenting with a custom GPT geared towards fact checking, which involves asking GPT-4 to produce sources and cite text to cross-verify articles and social media posts. On the week of 12/14/2023, here is an example output the GPT produced:</p>

<p><img src="https://dmicz.github.io/assets/img/openai-changes/truthgpt-citations.png" alt="GPT-4 has several citation links to different articles"></p>

<p>These links even use <a href="https://chromestatus.com/feature/4733392803332096">scroll to text fragments</a> to link directly to specific lines of text in the article being examined or other sources. I figured this means that the GPT-4 function calls give the model the full article, so I investigated this further:</p>

<p><img src="https://dmicz.github.io/assets/img/openai-changes/truthgpt-function-calls.png" alt="A list provided by GPT-4 of the function calls used to verify article"></p>

<p>This version of GPT-4 readily gave a list of the function calls it made to form its response, and it has access to the functions <code>click</code> and <code>quote_lines</code>, which the current ChatGPT version does not.</p>

<p><img src="https://dmicz.github.io/assets/img/openai-changes/truthgpt-version.png" alt="Text in ChatGPT shows that the custom GPT was out of date"></p>

<p><em>The ChatGPT website confirms the model using these calls was now out of date.</em></p>

<p>Interestingly enough, when telling the model that has access to <code>quote_lines</code> to describe its tool instructions it repeated back the same tool instructions as the current version of ChatGPT. I speculate this is because the tool instructions get updated universally everyday for all models, regardless of their version (the tool instructions always include the current date). However, the old version was still able to use the <code>quote_lines</code> function, and had access to the older functions, allowing it to repeat the exact text from the webpage. A version of the old browser tools can be found floating around the internet, such as on the OpenAI forums <a href="https://community.openai.com/t/change-internet-connectivity-response-length-and-response-mode-anywhere-within-any-conversation/401984/2">here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://dmicz.github.io/assets/img/openai-changes/website-description.png" alt="ChatGPT writes a plaintext version of a website"></p>

<p><em>ChatGPT repeats back how the website is given by the browser tool.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://dmicz.github.io/assets/img/openai-changes/fda-website.png" alt="The website that has been given to ChatGPT"></p>

<p><em>The website used in this example.</em></p>

<p>This also shows a lot in terms of how OpenAI implemented the browser tools for GPT-4, converting HTML into a markdown format with alt text for images. However, the new version of ChatGPT is completely unable to do this, stating it can only offer a summary or answer questions about the websites in question.</p>

<p><img src="https://dmicz.github.io/assets/img/openai-changes/website-refusal.png" alt="ChatGPT is unable to reproduce website content"></p>

<p><em>The current version of ChatGPT refuses to reproduce or cite website content.</em></p>

<p>Furthermore, ChatGPT is unable to make citations to specific lines of the articles it is browsing, although it can link to websites it visits through its search function.</p>

<p>I speculate that because ChatGPT is unable to repeat back entire websites or quotes, there are either stricter controls on reproducing content from websites, or the function call has been modified to provide specific information being returned from websites. For example, the new function may pass a website’s content through another GPT model (perhaps a smaller model to save on inference costs) with a specific prompt, before returning it back to GPT-4. This would significantly reduce the amount of input tokens used by the tool, reducing the impact that opening multiple websites may have on the quality of a conversation and the cost of the extra input tokens.</p>

<p>I would also take this speculation with a grain of salt, as the function call’s exact responses are entirely opaque and ChatGPT insists it is able to read the entire website when using the browser tools. After several dozen prompting attempts, OpenAI seems to have implemented very resilient protections against reproducing website content, and I was not able to get the current version of ChatGPT to reproduce anything.</p>

<h2 id="implications-for-user-experience">Implications for User Experience</h2>

<p>The clearest change this update has on user experience is that GPT-4 will be less effective or unable to cite specific lines or reproduce quotes from any website it visits. When it came to the use case I was experimenting with earlier (using a custom GPT to fact check articles and websites), this signficiantly decreased the quality of the responses and GPT-4 fell back on relying on itself rather than the browser tool.</p>

<p>Why make this change in the first place? As OpenAI is under increasing scrutiny regarding copyright laws and reproduction of content on the internet, this change seems to be primarily aimed at eliminating this issue. However, the elimination of the <code>quote_lines</code> function and citations by GPT-4 suggest that this change may have been a cost-cutting measure. If OpenAI did in fact implement the new <code>open_url</code> and <code>mclick</code> functions by getting another model to summarize or produce text from a website rather than ChatGPT itself, it may drop the quality of the responses down across the board, but I suspect this hasn’t been done.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Humans are capable of strategically deceptive behavior: behaving helpfully in most situations, but then behaving very differently in order to pursue alternative objectives when given the opportunity. If an AI system learned such a deceptive strategy, could we detect it and remove it using current state-of-the-art safety training techniques? To study this question, we construct proof-of-concept examples of deceptive behavior in large language models (LLMs). For example, we train models that write secure code when the prompt states that the year is 2023, but insert exploitable code when the stated year is 2024. We find that such backdoored behavior can be made persistent, so that it is not removed by standard safety training techniques, including supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training (eliciting unsafe behavior and then training to remove it). The backdoored behavior is most persistent in the largest models and in models trained to produce chain-of-thought reasoning about deceiving the training process, with the persistence remaining even when the chain-of-thought is distilled away. Furthermore, rather than removing backdoors, we find that adversarial training can teach models to better recognize their backdoor triggers, effectively hiding the unsafe behavior. Our results suggest that, once a model exhibits deceptive behavior, standard techniques could fail to remove such deception and create a false impression of safety.
