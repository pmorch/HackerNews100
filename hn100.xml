                      <p>We all have pet peeves, even though&nbsp;there’s a lot going on in the world that makes them&nbsp;pretty insignificant. While acknowledging that there are many more important things in life, I write this post about my own personal illustration pet peeve in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, it’ll make a little teeny difference. Here goes:</p>
<p>I love butterflies. They’re one of my favorite subjects to illustrate and one of my favorite sights in nature. To me, they’re a symbol of hope, an embodiment of beauty, and a sign of what’s right in the world. I think that’s why it bothers me when&nbsp;depictions of butterflies often fail to&nbsp;do them justice, whether they are&nbsp;in a work of art, a website, a product, an animation, or in print.</p>
<p>My explanation needs to begin with a description of&nbsp;a dead&nbsp;butterfly. When a butterfly is placed in an insect collection, the person who prepares it positions its wings&nbsp;according to a convention that facilitates identification. In the photo of a dead, pinned butterfly&nbsp;below, note&nbsp;that the trailing edge of the forewings (blue line) is perpendicular to the body’s axis (red line). When the insect has just been killed, it remains flexible for awhile, allowing the collector&nbsp;time&nbsp;to insert a pin and manipulate its wings into this position, where they are held in place until they become dry and stiff.&nbsp;This is an unnatural position for the wings;&nbsp;it’s a pose that may be possible&nbsp;for the insect to assume in life, but not a position that most species typically assume.</p>

<p>In field guides&nbsp;and other butterfly reference materials, one frequently sees images of such pinned butterflies&nbsp;because, I presume, it is easy to photograph a dead butterfly. Also,&nbsp;numerous photos of dead butterflies against the same background is aesthetically consistent, and the pinned&nbsp;position allows the viewer to see as much of the hind wings as possible, aiding&nbsp;identification. It is a useful convention and it makes sense&nbsp;in&nbsp;field guides.</p>
<p>By contrast, butterflies that are alive and going about their business of flying and nectaring do not typically hold their forewings too far forward of their head.&nbsp;In life, the way a butterfly holds its&nbsp;wings is variable, but it is uncommon for most species that I’ve encountered to hold their forewings in the manner of pinned specimen. Here are some photographs I’ve taken over the years that demonstrate this:</p>

<p>As you can see, in most cases, it is the <em>leading</em> edge of the forewings that is nearly perpendicular to the body. One will notice quite a bit of variability in wing positions in living butterflies, but it’s atypical&nbsp;for the trailing edge of the forewings to be perpendicular to the body. This is true not only of butterflies that are perched, but also of butterflies aloft. As an example, view this<a href="http://www.gettyimages.ca/license/138307199" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;photo of monarchs in flight</a>. There are exceptions, of course. It seems that some of the smaller butterflies may exhibit wing positions fairly close to that of a dead, pinned specimen:</p>

<p>I suspect that the&nbsp;field guide&nbsp;photos of dead, pinned butterflies are the ultimate (though unwitting)&nbsp;source of&nbsp;my pet peeve: The pervasive phenomenon of butterflies in popular culture being shown as dead, with the trailing edge of their forewings perpendicular to their body. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>You can see <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/eoskins/9975461605" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at this link</a> that the practice of illustrating dead butterflies goes back a long way, in a painting by a 19th century artist.</p>
<p>A particularly ironic&nbsp;example is <a href="https://www.scarce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Flight-of-butterflies-film-poster.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this movie poster</a> for a documentary about the flight of monarchs. Some of the flying monarch&nbsp;illustrations&nbsp;are accurate, but the largest and many&nbsp;of the others are clearly dead, even though they’re depicted as if in flight.</p>
<p>Stock photography sites include misleading photos of dead butterflies&nbsp;purporting to be in flight. Here’s<a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/ca/photo/monarch-butterflies-in-various-flying-positions-isolated-on-white-gm185302115-19288861?st=_p_monarch%20butterfly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> one</a>. Here’s <a href="https://www.dreamstime.com/stock-photo-monarch-butterfly-flying-beautiful-isolated-white-background-image46588423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another</a>. It’s understandable that customers&nbsp;would accept the description as accurate, even though it isn’t.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.askideas.com/50-amazing-3d-butterfly-tattoos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This website </a>shows numerous&nbsp;butterfly tattoos.&nbsp;Only a few look alive, despite the tattoo artists’ clever&nbsp;technique&nbsp;of inking&nbsp;cast shadows to give the impression that the butterflies are actually perched on the skin. Had the recipients of dead butterfly tattoos known the difference between a living and a dead butterfly, I have to believe they would&nbsp;have more carefully considered their options. I think a depiction of a living butterfly is the most effective way&nbsp;to convey its positive symbolism.</p>
<p>Dead butterflies are frequently spotted in gift shops. You can rest your head against them, adorn your ears with them, hang them on your wall, enoy&nbsp;them while you sip a beverage, wrap your gifts with them, or wear them:</p>

<p>I have blurred a couple company names in the photos above because I’m not trying to shame anyone. Most people have seen and are influenced by&nbsp;thousands (millions?) of depictions of unintentionally dead butterflies and have never considered&nbsp;the difference between a living and a dead butterfly. That’s why I decided to write this post.</p>
<p>I’m not innocent of committing my own pet peeve.&nbsp;In 2001, I illustrated the endangered Karner Blue butterfly using pinned specimens&nbsp;as a reference:</p>

<p>Had I realized&nbsp;then what I know now, I would have changed the wing and leg positions to be more lifelike. It would have made for a better representation, even though I&nbsp;was not attempting to show the insects in flight or perched on a flower. Nowadays, if you ask me to illustrate a butterfly, I will position its wings&nbsp;as if it is&nbsp;alive:</p>

<p>I realize there are some instances where it isn’t clear that the artist/designer intended to show a living butterfly, and where it may be perfectly acceptable to represent a dead butterfly. Nonetheless, there’s no good reason to depict a dead butterfly in the vast majority of situations. It doesn’t take much effort to be accurate about wing position. My hope is that the multitudes of butterfly images in our culture will gradually shift toward alive, which is how I prefer to think of&nbsp;them, and how I think these beautiful insects should be seen.</p>
<p>If you hadn’t previously noted the difference between a living and a dead butterfly, I’m afraid&nbsp;you will now begin to see dead butterflies EVERYWHERE, as I do.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/#introduction"> (§)</a></h2>
<p>At work, one of the things I do pretty often is write print generators in HTML to recreate and replace forms that the company has traditionally done handwritten on paper or in Excel. This allows the company to move into new web-based tools where the form is autofilled by URL parameters from our database, while getting the same physical output everyone's familiar with.</p>
<p>This article explains some of the CSS basics that control how your webpages look when printed, and a couple of tips and tricks I've learned that might help you out.</p>

<p>Here are some sample page generators to establish some context, and perhaps a shred of credibility.</p>
<p>I'll be the first to admit these pages are a little bit ugly and could use more polish. But they get the job done and I'm still employed.</p>

<h2 id="page">@page<a href="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/#page"> (§)</a></h2>
<p>CSS has a rule called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@page"><code>@page</code></a> that informs the browser of your website's printing preferences. Normally, I use</p>
<div><pre><span>@</span><span>page</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>size</span><span>:</span> <span>Letter</span> <span>portrait</span><span>;</span>
    <span>margin</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div><p>I will explain why I choose <code>margin: 0</code> in the later section about margins. You should use Letter or A4 as appropriate for your relationship with the metric system.</p>
<p>Setting the size and margin of @page is not the same as setting the width, height, and margin of your <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. @page is beyond the DOM — it contains the DOM. On the web, your <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element is bounded by the edges of your screen, but when printing it is bounded by @page.</p>
<p>The settings controlled by @page more or less correspond to the settings you get in your browser's print dialog when you press Ctrl+P.</p>
<p>Here's a sample file I used to do some experiments:</p>
<div><pre><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>style</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>@</span><span>page</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>/* see below for each experiment */</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>html</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>%</span><span>;</span>
    <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>%</span><span>;</span>
    <span>background-color</span><span>:</span> <span>lightblue</span><span>;</span>

    <span>/* grid by shunryu111 https://stackoverflow.com/a/32861765/5430534 */</span>

<span>}</span>

</pre></div><p>Here's how that looks in the browser:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/sample_in_browser.png" title="but i don't want new chrome"></p>
<p>And here are the results of some different @page values:</p>
<p><code>@page { size: Letter portrait; margin: 1in; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/letter_portrait_1in.png"></p>
<p><code>@page { size: Letter landscape; margin: 1in; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/letter_landscape_in1.png"></p>
<p><code>@page { size: Letter landscape; margin: 0; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/letter_landscape_0.png"></p>
<p>Setting the @page size won't actually put that size of paper into your printer's feed tray. <a href="https://youtu.be/3z9YjGWaxC0" title="Office Space - PC Load Letter?">You'll have to do that part yourself</a>.</p>
<p>Notice how when I set <code>size</code> to A5, my printer stays on Letter, and the A5 size fits entirely within the Letter size which gives the appearance of a margin even though it's not coming from the <code>margin</code> setting.</p>
<p><code>@page { size: A5 portrait; margin: 0; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/a5_portrait_0.png"></p>
<p>But if I tell the printer that I have actual A5 paper loaded, then it looks as expected.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/a5_portrait_0_a5paper.png"></p>
<p>From what I gather by experimentation, Chrome only follows the @page rule if you have Margin set to Default. As soon as you change Margin in the print dialog, your output is instead the product of your physical paper size and the chosen margin.</p>
<p><code>@page { size: A5 portrait; margin: 0; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/a5_portrait_0_default.png"></p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/a5_portrait_0_none.png"></p>
<p>Even when you choose a @page size that fits fully within your physical paper, the <code>margin</code> still matters. Here, I make a 5x5 square with no margin, and a 5x5 square with margin. The size of the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element is bounded by the @page size <strong>and</strong> margin combined.</p>
<p><code>@page { size: 5in 5in; margin: 0; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/5in_5in_0.png"></p>
<p><code>@page { size: 5in 5in; margin: 1in; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/5in_5in_1in.png"></p>
<p>I did all these tests not because I expect to print on A5 or 5x5 paper, but because it took me a while to figure out what exactly @page is. Now I am pretty confident in always using Letter with margin 0.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media">media query</a> called <code>print</code> where you can write styles that only apply during printing. My generator pages often contain a header, some options, and some help text for the user that obviously shouldn't come out on the print, so this is where you add <code>display:none</code> on those elements.</p>
<div><pre><span>/* Normal styles that appear while you are preparing the document */</span>
<span>header</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>block</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>@</span><span>media</span> <span>print</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>/* Disappear when you are printing the document */</span>
    <span>header</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>none</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

<p>You'll need to know a bit about the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model">box model</a> to get the margins you want without wrestling the computer too much.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/box_model.png"></a></p>
<p>The reason I always set @page <code>margin: 0</code> is that I'd rather handle the margins on the DOM elements instead. When I tried to use @page <code>margin: 0.5in</code>, I would often accidentally wind up with double-margins that squash the content smaller than I expected, and my one-page design spilled onto a second page.</p>
<p>If I wanted to use @page margin, then the actual page content would need to be laid out all the way up against the edges of the DOM, which is harder for me to think about and harder to preview before printing. It is mentally easier for me to remember that <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> occupies the entire physical paper and my margins are within the DOM instead of beyond it.</p>
<div><pre><span>@</span><span>page</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>size</span><span>:</span> <span>Letter</span> <span>portrait</span><span>;</span>
    <span>margin</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>html</span><span>,</span>
<span>body</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>8.5</span><span>in</span><span>;</span>
    <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>11</span><span>in</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div><p>When it comes to multi-page print generators, you're going to want a separate DOM element representing each page. Since you can't have multiple <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, you're going to need another element. I like <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>. Even for single-page generators, you may as well always use an article.</p>
<p>Since each <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> represents one page, I don't want any margins or padding on <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. We're pushing the logic one step further — it is easier for me to let the article occupy the entire physical page and put my margins within it.</p>
<div><pre><span>@</span><span>page</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>size</span><span>:</span> <span>Letter</span> <span>portrait</span><span>;</span>
    <span>margin</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>html</span><span>,</span>
<span>body</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>margin</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>article</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>8.5</span><span>in</span><span>;</span>
    <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>11</span><span>in</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div><p>When I talk about adding margin within my article, I'm not using the <code>margin</code> property, I'm using <code>padding</code>. That's because <code>margin</code> goes outside and around your element in the box model. If you use a <code>margin</code> of 0.5in, you'll have to set the article to 7.5×10 so that the article plus 2×margin equals 8.5×11. And if you want to adjust that margin you'll have to adjust the other dimensions.</p>
<p>Instead, <code>padding</code> goes on the inside of the element, so I can define the article to be 8.5×11 with 0.5in padding, and all the elements inside the article will stay on the page.</p>
<p>A lot of intuition about element dimensions is easier when you set <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing"><code>box-sizing: border-box</code></a>. It makes it so that the outer dimensions of the article are locked in while you adjust the inner padding. This is my snippet:</p>
<div><pre><span>html</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>box-sizing</span><span>:</span> <span>border-box</span><span>;</span>

<p>Once you've got your articles and margins set up, the space inside the article is yours to do with as you please. Design your document using whatever HTML/CSS you feel is appropriate for the project. Sometimes this means laying out elements with flex or grid because you've been given some leeway with the output. Sometimes it means creating squares of a specific size to fit on a certain brand of sticker paper. Sometimes it means absolutely positioning absolutely everything to the millimeter because the user needs to feed a special piece of pre-labeled paper through the printer to get your data on top of it, and you're not in control of that special paper.</p>
<p>I'm not here to give a tutorial on how to write HTML in general, so you'll need to be able to do that. All I can say is be mindful of that fact that you're dealing with the limited real estate of a piece of paper, unlike a browser window which can scroll and zoom to any length or scale. If your document will contain an arbitrary number of items, be ready to paginate by creating more <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="multipage_documents_with_repeating_elements">Multi-page documents with repeating elements<a href="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/#multipage_documents_with_repeating_elements"> (§)</a></h2>
<p>A lot of the print generators I write contain tabular data, like an invoice full of line items. If your <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> is large enough to go onto a second page, the browser will automatically duplicate the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> at the top of each page.</p>

<p>That's great if you're just printing a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> with no frills, but in a lot of real scenarios it's not that simple. The document I'm recreating often has a letterhead on the top of each page, a footer on the bottom, and other custom elements that need to be explicitly repeated on each page. If you just print a single long table across pages, you don't have much ability to place other elements above, below, and around it on intermediate pages.</p>
<p>So, I generate the pages using javascript, splitting the table into several smaller ones. The general approach here is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Treat the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> elements as disposable and be ready to regenerate them at any time from objects in memory. All user input and configuration should take place in a separate header / options box, outside of the articles.</li>
<li>Write a function called <code>new_page</code> that creates a new article element with the necessary repeating header/footer/etc.</li>
<li>Write a function called <code>render_pages</code> that creates the articles from the base data, calling <code>new_page</code> every time it fills up the previous one. I usually use <code>offsetTop</code> to see when the content is getting far along the page, though you could <strong>definitely</strong> use smarter techniques to get the perfect fit on each page.</li>
<li>Call <code>render_pages</code> whenever the base data changes.</li>

</pre></div><p>It is usually good to include a "page X of Y" counter on your pages. Since the number of pages is not known until all pages are generated, I can't do this during the for loop. I call a function like this at the end:</p>
<div><pre><span>function</span> <span>renumber_pages</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>

</pre></div><h2 id="portrait_landscape_mode">Portrait / Landscape mode<a href="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/#portrait_landscape_mode"> (§)</a></h2>
<p>I've shown that the @page rule helps inform the browser's default print settings, but the user can override it if they want to. If you set @page to portrait mode and the user overrides it to landscape mode, your layout and pagination might look wrong, especially if you are hardcoding any page thresholds.</p>
<p>You can accommodate them by creating separate <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> elements for portrait and landscape, and using javascript to switch between them. There might be a better way to do this, but at-rules like @page behave differently than normal CSS properties so I'm not sure. You should also save some variable that can help your <code>render_pages</code> function do the right thing.</p>
<p>You could also stop hardcoding thresholds, but then I'd have to follow my own advice.</p>

</pre></div><h2 id="data_source">Data source<a href="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/#data_source"> (§)</a></h2>
<p>There are a couple of ways to get your data onto the page. Sometimes, I pack all of the data into the URL parameters, so the javascript just does <code>const url_params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);</code> and then a bunch of <code>url_params.get("title")</code>. This has some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The page loads very fast.</li>
<li>It's easy to debug and experiment by changing the URL.</li>
<li>The generator works offline.</li>
</ul>
<p>This also has some disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The URLs become very long and unweildy, people cannot comfortably email them to each other. See sample links at the top of this article.</li>
<li>If the URL does get sent in an email, that data is "locked in", even if the source record in your database changes later.</li>
<li>Browsers do have limits on URL length. The limits are pretty high but not infinite and might vary per client.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes I instead use javascript to fetch our database records over the API, so the URL parameters just contain the record's primary key and maybe a mode setting.</p>
<p>This has some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The URLs are much shorter.</li>
<li>The data is always fresh.</li>
</ul>
<p>and disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user has to wait a second while the data is being fetched.</li>
<li>You have to write more code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes I set <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable"><code>contenteditable</code></a> on the articles so the user can make small changes before printing. I also like to use real, live checkbox inputs they can click before printing. These features add some convenience, but in most cases it would be wiser to make the user change the source record in the database first. Also, they limit your ability to treat the article elements as disposable.</p>

<p>Atom­ic physi­cist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> is famous­ly quot­ed as say­ing, “Pre­dic­tion is very dif­fi­cult, espe­cial­ly if it’s about the future.” Yet despite years of get­ting things wrong, mag­a­zines love think pieces on where we’ll be in sev­er­al decades, even cen­turies in time. It gives us com­fort to think great things await us, even though we’re long over­due for the per­son­al jet­pack and moon colonies.</p>

<p>And yet it’s Asi­mov who appar­ent­ly owned the only set of post­cards of <em><a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/france-in-the-year-2000-1899-1910/">En L’An 2000</a></em>, a set of 87 (or so) col­lectible artist cards that first appeared as inserts in cig­ar box­es in 1899, right in time for the 1900 World Exhi­bi­tion in Paris. Trans­lat­ed as “France in the 21st Cen­tu­ry,” the cards fea­ture Jean-Marc Côté and oth­er illus­tra­tors’ inter­pre­ta­tions of the way we’d be living…well, 23 years ago.</p>


<p>The his­to­ry of the card’s pro­duc­tion is very con­vo­lut­ed, with the orig­i­nal com­mis­sion­ing com­pa­ny going out of busi­ness before they could be dis­trib­uted, and whether that com­pa­ny was a toy man­u­fac­tur­er or a cig­a­rette com­pa­ny, nobody seems to know. And were the ideas giv­en to the artists, or did they come up with them on their own? We don’t know.</p>

<p>One of the first things that stands out scan­ning through these prints, now host­ed&nbsp;at <em><a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/france-in-the-year-2000-1899-1910/">The Pub­lic Domain Review</a></em>, is a com­plete absence of space trav­el, despite Jules Verne hav­ing writ­ten <em><a href="http://jv.gilead.org.il/pg/moon/">From the Earth to the Moon</a></em> in 1865 (which would influ­ence Georges Méliès’ <em><a href="http://www.openculture.com/2013/08/a-trip-to-the-moon-and-five-other-free-films-by-georges-melies-the-father-of-special-effects.html">A Voy­age to the Moon</a></em> in 1902). How­ev­er, the under­wa­ter world spawned many a flight of fan­cy, includ­ing a whale-drawn bus, a cro­quet par­ty at the bot­tom of the ocean, and large fish being raced like thor­ough­bred hors­es.</p>

<p>There are a few inven­tions we can say came true. The “Advance Sen­tinel in a Heli­copter” has been doc­u­ment­ing traf­fic and car chas­es for decades now, fed right into our tele­vi­sions. A lot of farm work is now auto­mat­ed. And “Elec­tric Scrub­bing” is now called a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLt5rBfNucc">Room­ba</a>.</p>

<p>For a card-by-card exam­i­na­tion of these future visions, one should hunt out Isaac Asimov’s 1986 <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1OvGupZ">Future­days: A Nine­teenth Cen­tu­ry Vision of the Year 2000</a></em>, which can be found on Ama­zon right now. (Or see the nice gallery of images at <em><a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/france-in-the-year-2000-1899-1910/">The Pub­lic Domain Review</a></em>.) And who knows? Maybe next year, your order will come to your door by drone. Just a pre­dic­tion.</p>

<p>3rd March 2024</p>

<p>Mike Bostock, <a href="https://observablehq.com/blog/observable-2-0">Announcing: Observable Framework</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we’re launching <a href="https://observablehq.com/product">Observable 2.0</a> with a bold new vision: an open-source static site generator for building fast, beautiful data apps, dashboards, and reports.</p>
<p>Our mission is to help teams communicate more effectively with data. Effective presentation of data is critical for deep insight, nuanced understanding, and informed decisions. Observable notebooks are great for ephemeral, <em>ad hoc</em> data exploration. But notebooks aren’t well-suited for polished dashboards and apps.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://observablehq.com/framework/">Observable Framework</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="static-site-dashboards">A static site generator for data projects and dashboards</h4>
<p>At its heart, Observable Framework is a static site generator. You give it a mixture of Markdown and JavaScript (and potentially other languages too) and it compiles them all together into fast loading interactive pages.</p>
<p>It ships with a full featured hot-reloading server, so you can edit those files in your editor, hit save and see the changes reflected instantly in your browser.</p>
<p>Once you’re happy with your work you can run a build command to turn it into a set of static files ready to deploy to a server—or you can use the <code>npm run deploy</code> command to deploy it directly to Observable’s own authenticated sharing platform.</p>
<h4 id="javascript-in-markdown">JavaScript in Markdown</h4>
<p>The key to the design of Observable Framework is the way it uses JavaScript in Markdown to create interactive documents.</p>
<p>Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<div><pre><span># <span>This is a document</span></span>

Markdown content goes here.

This will output 1870:

<span>```</span><span>js</span>
<span>34</span> <span>*</span> <span>55</span>
<span>```</span>

And here's the current date and time, updating constantly:

<span>```</span><span>js</span>
<span>new</span> <span>Date</span>(now)
<span>```</span>

The same thing as an inline string: ${new Date(now)}</pre></div>
<p>Any Markdown code block tagged <code>js</code> will be executed as JavaScript in the user’s browser. This is an <em>incredibly</em> powerful abstraction—anything you can do in JavaScript (which these days is effectively anything at all) can now be seamlessly integrated into your document.</p>
<p>In the above example the <code>now</code> value is interesting—it’s a special variable that provides the current time in milliseconds since the epoch, updating constantly. Because <code>now</code> updates constantly, the display value of the cell and that inline expression will update constantly as well.</p>
<p>If you’ve used Observable Notebooks before this will feel familiar—but notebooks involve code and markdown authored in separate cells. With Framework they are all now part of a single text document.</p>
<p>Aside: when I tried the above example I found that the <code>${new Date(now)}</code> inline expression displayed as <code>Mon Feb 19 2024 20:46:02 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)</code> while the <code>js</code> block displayed as <code>2024-02-20T04:46:02.641Z</code>. That’s because inline expressions use the JavaScript default string representation of the object, while the <code>js</code> block uses the Observable <code>display()</code> function which has its own rules for how to display different types of objects, <a href="https://github.com/observablehq/inspector/blob/main/src/inspect.js">visible in inspect/src/inspect.js</a>.</p>
<h4 id="everything-reactive">Everything is still reactive</h4>
<p>The best feature of Observable Notebooks is their <em>reactivity</em>—the way cells automatically refresh when other cells they depend on change. This is a big difference to Python’s popular Jupyter notebooks, and is the signature feature of <a href="https://marimo.io/">marimo</a>, a new Python notebook tool.</p>
<p>Observable Framework retains this feature in its new JavaScript Markdown documents.</p>
<p>This is particularly useful when working with form inputs. You can drop an input onto a page and refer its value throughout the rest of the document, adding realtime interactivity to documents incredibly easily.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. I ported one of my <a href="https://observablehq.com/@simonw/datasette-downloads-per-day-with-observable-plot">favourite notebooks</a> to Framework, which provides a tool for viewing download statistics for my various Python packages.</p>
<p>The Observable Framework version can be found at <a href="https://simonw.github.io/observable-framework-experiments/package-downloads">https://simonw.github.io/observable-framework-experiments/package-downloads</a>—source code <a href="https://github.com/simonw/observable-framework-experiments/blob/main/docs/package-downloads.md">here on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/pypi-dashboard.gif" alt="Animated demo showing PyPI download stats for Datasette projects - as I switch a select menu between sqlite-utils and csv-diff and shot-scraper the displayed chart updates to match."></p>
<p>This entire thing is just 57 lines of Markdown. Here’s the code with additional comments (and presented in a slightly different order—the order of code blocks doesn’t matter in Observable thanks to reactivity).</p>
<div><pre><span># <span>PyPI download stats for Datasette projects</span></span>

Showing downloads for <span>**</span>${packageName}<span>**</span></pre></div>
<p>It starts with a Markdown <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading and text that shows the name of the selected package.</p>
<div><pre><span>```</span><span>js</span> echo
<span>const</span> <span>packageName</span> <span>=</span> <span>view</span>(<span>Inputs</span>.<span>select</span>(packages, {
  value<span>:</span> <span><span>"</span>sqlite-utils<span>"</span></span>,
  label<span>:</span> <span><span>"</span>Package<span>"</span></span>
}));
<span>```</span></pre></div>
<p>This block displays the select widget allowing the user to pick one of the items from the <code>packages</code> array (defined later on).</p>
<p><code>Inputs.select()</code> is a built-in method provided by Framework, described in the <a href="https://observablehq.com/framework/lib/inputs">Observable Inputs</a> documentation.</p>
<p>The <code>view()</code> function is new in Observable Framework—it’s the thing that enables the reactivity, ensuring that updates to the input selection are acted on by other code blocks in the document.</p>
<p>Because <code>packageName</code> is defined with <code>const</code> it becomes a variable that is visible to other <code>js</code> blocks on the page. It’s used by this next block:</p>
<div><pre><span>```</span><span>js</span> echo
<span>const</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>d3</span>.<span>json</span>(
  <span><span>`</span>https://datasette.io/content/stats.json?_size=max&amp;package=<span><span>${</span>packageName<span>}</span></span>&amp;_sort_desc=date&amp;_shape=array<span>`</span></span>
);</pre></div>
<p>Here we are fetching the data that we need for the chart. I’m using <code>d3.json()</code> (all of D3 is available in Framework) to fetch the data from a URL that includes the selected package name.</p>
<p>The data is coming from <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>, using the Datasette JSON API. I have a SQLite table at <a href="https://datasette.io/content/stats">datasette.io/content/stats</a> that’s updated once a day with the latest PyPI package statistics via a convoluted series of GitHub Actions workflows, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/#baked-data-datasette-io">described previously</a>.</p>
<p>Adding <code>.json</code> to that URL returns the JSON, then I ask for rows for that particular package, sorted descending by date and returning the maximum number of rows (1,000) as a JSON array of objects.</p>
<p>Now that we have <code>data</code> as a variable we can manipulate it slightly for use with Observable Plot—parsing the SQLite string dates into JavaScript <code>Date</code> objects:</p>
<div><pre><span>```</span><span>js</span> echo
<span>const</span> <span>data_with_dates</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span>.<span>map</span>(<span>function</span>(<span>d</span>) {
  d.date = d3.<span>timeParse</span>(<span><span>"</span>%Y-%m-%d<span>"</span></span>)(d.date);
  return d;
})
```</pre></div>
<p>This code is ready to render as a chart. I’m using <a href="https://observablehq.com/plot">Observable Plot</a>—also packaged with Framework:</p>
<pre><code>```js echo
Plot.plot({
  y: {
    grid: true,
    label: `${packageName} PyPI downloads per day`
  },
  width: width,
  marginLeft: 60,
  marks: [
    Plot.line(data_with_dates, {
      x: "date",
      y: "downloads",
      title: "downloads",
      tip: true
    })
  ]
})
```
</code></pre>
<p>So we have one cell that lets the user pick the package they want, a cell that fetches that data, a cell that processes it and a cell that renders it as a chart.</p>
<p>There’s one more piece of the puzzle: where does that list of packages come from? I fetch that with another API call to Datasette. Here I’m using a SQL query executed against the <a href="https://datasette.io/content">/content</a> database directly:</p>
<div><pre><span>```</span><span>js</span> echo
<span>const</span> <span>packages_sql</span> <span>=</span> <span><span>"</span>select package from stats group by package order by max(downloads) desc<span>"</span></span>
<span>```</span>
<span>```</span><span>js</span> echo
<span>const</span> <span>packages</span> <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span>(
  <span><span>`</span>https://datasette.io/content.json?sql=<span><span>${</span><span>encodeURIComponent</span>(</span></span>
<span><span>    packages_sql</span></span>
<span><span>  )<span>}</span></span>&amp;_size=max&amp;_shape=arrayfirst<span>`</span></span>
).<span>then</span>((<span>r</span>) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>r</span>.<span>json</span>());
<span>```</span></pre></div>
<p><code>_shape=arrayfirst</code> is a shortcut for getting back a JSON array of the first column of the resulting rows.</p>
<p>That’s all there is to it! It’s a pretty tiny amount of code for a full interactive dashboard.</p>
<h4 id="only-code-you-use">Only include the code that you use</h4>
<p>You may have noticed that my dashboard example uses several additional libraries—<code>Inputs</code> for the form element, <code>d3</code> for the data fetching and <code>Plot</code> for the chart rendering.</p>
<p>Observable Framework is smart about these. It implements lazy loading in development mode, so code is only loaded the first time you attempt to use it in a cell.</p>
<p>When you build and deploy your application, Framework automatically loads just the referenced library code from the <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/">jsdelivr CDN</a>.</p>
<h4 id="cache-data-at-build">Cache your data at build time</h4>
<p>One of the most interesting features of Framework is its <a href="https://observablehq.com/framework/loaders">Data loader</a> mechanism.</p>
<p>Dashboards built using Framework can load data at runtime from anywhere using <code>fetch()</code> requests (or wrappers around them). This is how Observable Notebooks work too, but it leaves the performance of your dashboard at the mercy of whatever backends you are talking to.</p>
<p>Dashboards benefit from fast loading times. Framework encourages a pattern where you build the data for the dashboard at deploy time, bundling it together into static files containing just the subset of the data needed for the dashboard. These can be served lightning fast from the same static hosting as the dashboard code itself.</p>
<p>The design of the data loaders is beautifully simple and powerful. A data loader is a script that can be written in <em>any</em> programming language. At build time, Framework executes that script and saves whatever is outputs to a file.</p>
<p>A data loader can be as simple as the following, saved as <code>quakes.json.sh</code>:</p>
<div><pre>curl https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson</pre></div>
<p>When the application is built, that filename tells Framework the destination file (<code>quakes.json</code>) and the loader to execute (<code>.sh</code>).</p>
<p>This means you can load data from any source using any technology you like, provided it has the ability to output JSON or CSV or some other useful format to standard output.</p>
<h4 id="comparison-to-observable-notebooks">Comparison to Observable Notebooks</h4>
<p>Mike introduced Observable Framework as <em>Observable 2.0</em>. It’s worth reviewing how the this system compares to the original Observable Notebook platform.</p>
<p>I’ve been a huge fan of Observable Notebooks for years—<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/observable/">38 blog posts and counting</a>! The most obvious comparison is to Jupyter Notebooks, where they have some key differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observable notebooks use JavaScript, not Python.</li>
<li>The notebook editor itself isn’t open source—it’s a hosted product provided on <a href="https://observablehq.com/">observablehq.com</a>. You can export the notebooks as static files and run them anywhere you like, but the editor itself is a proprietary product.</li>
<li>Observable cells are <em>reactive</em>. This is the key difference with Jupyter: any time you change a cell all other cells that depend on that cell are automatically re-evaluated, similar to Excel.</li>
<li>The JavaScript syntax they use isn’t quite standard JavaScript—they had to invent a new <code>viewof</code> keyword to support their reactivity model.</li>
<li>Editable notebooks are a pretty complex proprietary file format. They don’t play well with tools like Git, to the point that Observable ended up implementing their own custom version control and collaboration systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Observable Framework reuses many of the ideas (and code) from Observable Notebooks, but with some crucial differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notebooks (really documents) are now <strong>single text files</strong>—Markdown files with embedded JavaScript blocks. It’s all still reactive, but the file format is much simpler and can be edited using any text editor, and checked into Git.</li>
<li>It’s <strong>all open source</strong>. Everything is under an ISC license (OSI approved) and you can run the full editing stack on your own machine.</li>
<li>It’s all just standard JavaScript now—<strong>no custom syntax</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="change-in-strategy">A change in strategy</h4>
<p>Reading the tea leaves a bit, this also looks to me like a strategic change of direction for Observable as a company. Their previous focus was on building great collaboration tools for data science and analytics teams, based around the proprietary Observable Notebook editor.</p>
<p>With Framework they appear to be leaning more into the developer tools space.</p>
<p>On Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/observablehq">@observablehq</a> describes itself as “The end-to-end solution for developers who want to build and host dashboards that don’t suck”—the Internet Archive copy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231003212202/https://twitter.com/observablehq">from October 3rd 2023</a> showed “Build data visualizations, dashboards, and data apps that impact your business — faster.”</p>
<p>I’m excited to see where this goes. I’ve limited my usage of Observable Notebooks a little in the past purely due to the proprietary nature of their platform and the limitations placed on free accounts (mainly the lack of free private notebooks), while still having enormous respect for the technology and enthusiastically adopting their open source libraries such as <a href="https://observablehq.com/plot/">Observable Plot</a>.</p>
<p>Observable Framework addresses basically all of my reservations. It’s a fantastic new expression of the ideas that made Observable Notebooks so compelling, and I expect to use it for all sorts of interesting projects in the future.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="quarto-content">




<main id="quarto-document-content">
<p>AI has made remarkable strides in the medical field, with capabilities including the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06555-x">detection of Parkinson’s disease via retinal images</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02361-0">identification of promising drug candidates</a>, and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06160-y">prediction of hospital readmissions</a>. While these advance are exciting, I’m wary of the practical impact AI will have on patients.</p>
<p>I recently watched a late-night talk show where skeptics and enthusiasts debated AI safety. Despite their conflicting views, there was one thing they could all agree upon. “AI will cure cancer,” one panelist declared, and everyone else confidently echoed their agreement. This collective optimism strikes me as overly idealistic and raises concerns about a failure to grapple with the realities of healthcare.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>My reservations about AI in medicine stem from two core issues: First, the medical system often disregards patient perspectives, inherently limiting our comprehension of medical conditions. Second, AI is used to disproportionately benefit the privileged while worsening inequality. In many instances, claims like “AI will cure cancer” are being invoked as little more than superficial marketing slogans. To understand why, it is first necessary to understand how AI is used, and how the medical system operates.</p>
<section id="how-automated-decision-making-is-used">
<h2 data-anchor-id="how-automated-decision-making-is-used">How Automated Decision Making is Used</h2>
<p>Automated computer systems, often involving AI, are increasingly being used to make decisions that have a big impact on people’s lives: determining who gets jobs, housing, or healthcare. Disturbing patterns are found across numerous countries and a range of systems: there is typically no way to surface or correct errors, and all too often the goal is to increase corporate and government revenues by denying poor people resources they need to survive.</p>
<p>A woman in France had her food benefits reduced by a computer program and can no longer afford enough to eat. She talked to a program officer, who said <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/11/10/how-eus-flawed-artificial-intelligence-regulation-endangers-social-safety-net">the cut was due to an error in the computer program</a>, but was unable to change it. She did not have her food benefits reinstated. The system was designed such that the computer is always considered correct, even when humans recognize an error. This woman was not alone; she was one of 60,000 people who went hungry due to these errors.</p>

<p>A man in Australia was told that he had been overpaid welfare benefits and that he was now in debt to the government. The debt was an error, based on an intentionally faulty calculation as part of the computational RoboDebt program. However, the man had no way to contest it. Despondent, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/20/platitudes-and-false-words-mother-of-robodebt-victim-who-took-own-life-tells-inquiry-of-government-stonewalling">he died by suicide</a>. This was not a one-off incident. The Australian government was later found to have wrongly created debts for hundreds of thousands of people.They were putting poor people into debt with a flawed calculation system, ruining lives efficiently at scale. The government had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/29/robodebt-government-to-repay-470000-unlawful-centrelink-debts-worth-721m">increased the number of poor people it put into debt</a> each week by 50x, compared to before RoboDebt.</p>
<p>A woman in the USA with cerebral palsy needed a health aid to help her get out of bed in the morning, to get her meals, and to complete other basic tasks. Her care was drastically <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17144260/healthcare-medicaid-algorithm-arkansas-cerebral-palsy">cut due to a computer bug</a>. She was given no explanation and no option for recourse as her quality of life drastically plummeted. Only through a lengthy court case was it finally revealed that many people with cerebral palsy had wrongly lost their care due to a computer error.</p>
</section>
<section id="patterns-in-automated-decision-making">
<h2 data-anchor-id="patterns-in-automated-decision-making">Patterns in Automated Decision Making</h2>
<p>These examples always flow in the same direction. <a href="https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/nmlr/vol50/iss3/2/">Professor Alvaro Bedoya</a>, the founding director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center, wrote “<em>It is a pattern throughout history that surveillance is used against those considered ‘less than’, against the poor man, the person of color, the immigrant, the heretic. It is used to try to stop marginalized people from achieving power.</em>” The same pattern is found in the role of technology in decision systems.</p>
<p>The goal of many automated decision systems is to increase revenues for governments and private companies. When this is applied to health and medicine, the goal is often achieved by denying poor people food or medical care. People often trust computers to be more accurate than humans, in a bias known as automation bias. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3240751/">systematic review of 74 research studies</a> found that automation bias exists across a range of fields, including healthcare, exerting a consistent influence. This bias can make it harder for people to recognize errors in automated decision-making. Moreover, implementing mechanisms to identify and correct errors is often seen as an unnecessary expense.</p>
<p>In all of the cases above, the people most impacted (those losing access to needed food or medical care, or unjustly being thrown into debt) recognized the errors in the system earliest. Yet the systems were built with no mechanism for recognizing mistakes, for allowing the participation of those impacted, nor for providing recourse to those harmed. Unfortunately, this can also be the case in medicine.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="how-the-medical-system-operates">How the Medical System Operates</h2>
<p>An AI algorithm that reads MRIs more accurately would not have helped neurologist Ilene Ruhoy, MD, PhD, when she developed a 7 cm brain tumor. The key obstacle to her treatment was getting fellow neurologists to believe her symptoms and even order an MRI in the first place. “<em>I was told I knew too much, that I was working too hard, that I was stressed out, that I was anxious</em>,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2022/women-pain-gender-bias-doctors/">Dr.&nbsp;Ruhoy recounts</a>. Eventually, after her symptoms worsened further, she was able to get an MRI and <a href="https://www.webmd.com/women/features/women-doctors-symptoms-dismissed">urgently sent in for a 7 hour surgery</a>. Because of the delay in her diagnosis, her tumor was so large that it could not be completely removed, which has led to it growing back since her first surgery.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Ruhoy’s experience is sadly common. While Dr.&nbsp;Ruhoy lives in the USA, a study in the UK found that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180523-how-gender-bias-affects-your-healthcare">almost 1 in 3 patients with brain tumors</a> had to visit doctors at least 5 times before receiving an accurate diagnosis. Again, MRI-reading AI can not help these patients whose doctors won’t order an MRI in the first place. On average, it takes <a href="https://academic.oup.com/rheumap/article/4/1/rkaa006/5758274">Lupus patients 7 years</a> to receive a correct diagnosis, and 1 in 3 are initially misdiagnosed with doctors incorrectly claiming mental health issues are the root of their symptoms. Even healthcare workers are often shocked at how quickly they are dismissed and disbelieved once they become patients. For instance, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/health-care-workers-long-covid-are-being-dismissed/620801/">interviews with a dozen healthcare workers</a> revealed that their colleagues shifted to discarding their expertise as soon as they developed Long Covid.</p>

</div>
<p>This disregard of patient experience and patient expertise severely limits medical knowledge. It results in delayed diagnoses, misdiagnoses, missing data, and incorrect data. AI is great at finding patterns in existing data. However, AI will not be able to solve this problem of missing and erroneous underlying data. Furthermore, there is a negative feedback loop around lack of medical data for poorly understood diseases: doctors disbelieve patients and dismiss them as anxious or complaining too much, failing to gather data which could help illuminate the disease.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="the-wrong-data">The Wrong Data</h2>
<p>Even worse, often research problems are reformulated to shoe-horn inadequate data sources in. Analyzing electronic health record data is cheaper than searching for new causal mechanisms. Medical data is often limited by the categories of billing codes, by what doctors choose to note from a patient’s account, and what tests are ordered. The data are inherently incomplete.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180518-the-inequality-in-how-women-are-treated-for-pain">Medical bias</a> is widespread, with studies documenting that doctors give <a href="https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/13/2/150/1935962">less pain medication to Black patients</a> than to white patients for the same conditions. On average, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180523-how-gender-bias-affects-your-healthcare">women have to wait months or years longer</a> than men to get an accurate diagnosis for the same conditions. This impacts the data that is collected and will be used for AI. <a href="https://aclanthology.org/D17-1323/">Multiple research studies</a> have shown that AI not only encodes existing biases, but <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09451">can also amplify their magnitude</a>. At heart, these biases often pivot on not believing marginalized people about their experiences: not believing when they say that they are in pain nor how they report their symptoms.</p>

<p>On a deeper level, ignoring patient expertise limits what hypotheses are devised, and can slow research progress. These issues will propagate into AI, unless researchers seek ways to include meaningful patient participation. These problems are not unique to any one country or any one type of medical system. Patients across the USA, UK, Australia, and Canada (the 4 countries I am most familiar with) are all well-documented to experience these issues.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="being-honest-about-the-risks-and-opportunities">Being Honest About the Risks and Opportunities</h2>
<p>While AI holds transformative possibilities for medicine, it is important that we are clear-eyed about both the risks and the opportunities. Many talks on Medical AI give the impression that the only thing holding medicine back is a lack of knowledge. The many other factors that influence medical care, including the systematic disregard for patients’ knowledge of their own experiences, are often ignored in these discussions. Ignoring these realities will lead people to design AI for an idealized medical system that does not exist. There is already a clear pattern in which AI is used to centralize power and harm the marginalized. In medicine, this could lead to patients, who are already disempowered and often disregarded, having even less autonomy or voice.</p>
<p>In my view, some of the most promising areas of research are participatory approaches to machine learning and patient-led medical research. The <a href="https://participatoryml.github.io/">Participatory Approaches to Machine Learning workshop at ICML</a> included a powerful collection of talks and papers on both the need and the opportunities for designing systems with greater participation of those impacted. AI ethics work on topics of contestability (building in ways for participants to contest outputs) and actionable recourse are necessary. For medical research more generally, the <a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/">Patient Led Research Collaborative</a> (focused on Long Covid) is an encouraging model. I hope that we can see more efforts within medical AI to center patient expertise.</p>

It puts the burden on you to opt out of each communication each message, each outreach from a loyalty program. It can feel like weeding a garden, but that garden is your attention. The weeds keep returning, insisting upon their removal. One after another.</p><p>I don't want to be sent weekly emails because I bought something from you <em>once</em>. I may have installed your app, but I don't want to navigate multiple screens, provide you with my email (which you've already abused) and deal with myriad toggles to get you to leave me alone.</p><p>Yes, I'm a registered voter, yes I know when to vote, yes I'm going to — leave me alone. Each contact is another number blocked. If you're going to call me and you can't leave me a voicemail (because, really — who's going to answer an unknown number?) that's another number to block. I've got a no soliciting sign on my door so no, no I don't want to talk to your canvasser.</p><p>GDPR was well intentioned, but the cookie banners and compliance cottage industry that grew out of it are a blight on the web. I'll opt out of all but your essential cookies, but I'd rather it be opt in (nobody's going to opt in). Couldn't we do this at the browser level? Set that preference once and leave me alone henceforth. I'm going to have the same opinion for every site seeking to so graciously bequeath my browser with cookies.</p><p>I don't want your direct mailers and I shouldn't have to opt out via DMA Choice. If I wanted them, I'd sign up for them (I don't want them).</p><p>Want my number for 2FA? Please, please, God do not use it to market to me.</p><p>Don't throw up a banner because I blocked your ads. I blocked your ads because, at this point, they're intrusive and they're a security risk. I'll root around and filter out the DOM node for your nag banner though. At this point, the only ads I see are on the jerseys of NBA players, but I seem to have developed banner blindness for those.</p><p>Let these things be opt in. You're a company, you're a political campaign and you want money or a vote. Outreach isn't about maintaining a relationship, it's about insisting on future transactions. It's insisting that someone engage with you when they would do so if they <em>cared to</em>.</p><p>So, while it's burdensome, I'm going to keep opting out. I'll screen out emails, I'll block them, I'll unsubscribe, I'll report them as spam. I'll reply with <code>STOP</code> to unsubscribe (again and again and again). I'll refuse direct mailers, I'll block ads, I'll block the banners that spring up in their place.</p><p>If I <em>need</em> something I'll buy it — I'll seek it out but if you insist upon my attention, if you make a pitch or a hard sale I'm going to walk away. It's reflexive.</p><p>I devote time to things I care deeply about. I'll chase them, I'll seek them out and I'll invest in them. Everyone does that to some degree or another. There is so much insistence and intrusion that opting out becomes both laborious and necessary.</p><p>An economy built on demanding attention is, frankly, hellish.</p><p>I'll keep weeding that garden and, I'll probably never be done, but hopefully it'll get better eventually.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Right now, I’m uncertain it’s not my thermal compound even.</p><p>I know modern CPUs – particularly Ryzen 5000/7000 or intel 13th/14th gen – are designed to boost as much as possible with tight margins around temperature and power limits.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>The kraken cooler is by default designed to vary the pump speed based on liquid temperature.

I had to find a way of controlling the radiator fans and also reading the CPU temperature.</p><p>For controlling the fans I considered making my own fan controller PCB, or using a <a href="https://www.corsair.com/uk/en/p/custom-liquid-cooling/cl-9011110-ww/icue-commander-pro-smart-rgb-lighting-and-fan-speed-controller-cl-9011110-ww" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corsair Commander</a> which I know can be interfaced under linux, also with liquidctl.</p><h3 id="lm-sensors">lm-sensors</h3><p>In the mean time, I looked at <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/lm_sensors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lm-sensors</a> has been around since the dawn of time.

This was thanks to the lm-sensors source code and <a href="https://github.com/lm-sensors/lm-sensors/blob/master/prog/pwm/fancontrol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">script</a>s – I was able to find a fan control bash script that appeared to be interfacing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sysfs</a> directly.</p><h3 id="sysfshwmon">sysfs/hwmon</h3><p>I figured I could do the same thing, and possibly read temperatures too!

This is for a family of system management chips, one of which exists on my motherboard. After loading this module, I could interface via <code>sysfs</code> – without <code>libsensors</code> or <code>lm-sensors</code>; this is great news as it means my script can be much simpler with one less dependency. nct6775-specific settings are <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/hwmon/nct6775" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented here</a>.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p><p>I’m also going to use <code>k10temp</code> to get the best reading of temperature from the CPU directly.</p><p>Here’s a quick summary on the files used to interface with fans and sensors with sysfs.

Make sure you restore automatic mode after! Note that simply switching from automatic to manual is usually enough, as it will cause 100% duty and make it obvious what fan is connected.</p><h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2><p>You can download the <a href="https://calbryant.uk/blog/better-pc-cooling-with-python/fangoblin3.py">complete script here</a>. I’ll explain the meat of how it works in this section. Be warned – the script is specific to my system, but could be adapted.</p><p>Note having the control loop running on my OS could be risky – if the control loop crashes, the CPU could overheat or damage could otherwise be caused. Bear this in mind. That said, the CPU is designed to throttle so in practice it would be difficult to cause any damage.</p><p>I also rely on systemd to restart the python application if it crashes. Crashing is detectable by checking <code>systemd</code> and observing the calibration cycle – the fans ramp up.</p><h3 id="calibration">Calibration</h3><p>I use Noctua fans. According to the Noctua datasheets, Noctua guarantee the fans can run above a 20% duty cycle; below that is undefined. Usually, fans will run quite a bit below this before stopping – we should figure out what the minimum value is empirically on startup for the quietest experience possible.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre tabindex="0"><code><span> 1

To be safe, I prefer no start from 0% duty and increment slowly until the fan starts so it will always recover from a stall – as above.</p><p>I discovered the fans can start at around 11% duty, 200RPM – almost half the guaranteed duty and less than half the min speed – great! This means less noise and dust.

As a result it’s silent, but to me more importantly it’s completely spotless after 3 years in 24/7 use! No dust whatsoever.</p><p>I experimented with this by letting the system idle with the radiator fans off but the pump at 100%:</p><figure><a href="https://calbryant.uk/blog/better-pc-cooling-with-python/nofans.png" target="_blank"><picture><source onload="this.style.background=&quot;none&quot;" srcset="https://calbryant.uk/blog/better-pc-cooling-with-python/nofans_hu81fca9cd2bb299336e36799b29d15b2e_212274_854x480_fit_q85_h2_lanczos_3.webp, https://calbryant.uk/blog/better-pc-cooling-with-python/nofans_hu81fca9cd2bb299336e36799b29d15b2e_212274_1708x960_fit_q85_h2_lanczos_3.webp 2x" type="image/webp"><img alt="The liquid temperature with the fans off at idle" height="289" onload="this.style.background=&quot;none&quot;" src="https://calbryant.uk/blog/better-pc-cooling-with-python/nofans_hu81fca9cd2bb299336e36799b29d15b2e_212274_854x480_fit_q90_bgffffff_lanczos_3.jpg" width="854" loading="lazy"></picture></a><figcaption>The liquid temperature with the fans off at idle</figcaption></figure><p>The liquid temperature quickly approaches the recommended maximum of 60c. This tells me it probably isn’t possible without a larger radiator. I intend to investigate more thoroughly though.</p><p>This also tells me that there’s a stark difference between cooling performance at minimum (silent!) fan speed and fans off. This could result in a hunting behaviour if the control algorithm isn’t right. The system would have to leave large gaps between the passive mode being activated to avoid sporadic system use resulting in toggling between maximum fan speed and zero.</p><p>In addition, we fill up the thermal mass in the process, meaning the CPU is likely to overheat immediately if loaded in this mode before the fans kick in and the liquid temperature drop. A solution to this may be to detect if the computer is in use (mouse movements) and only allow passive mode if not. The fans would start and bring down the liquid temperature as soon as the machine is used.</p><h3 id="abstraction">Abstraction</h3><p>Making the script useful for other machines could involve abstracting coolers and sensors. The control loop for each pair could also be in a separate thread to prevent a crash in one causing the others to stop too.</p><h3 id="integrated-monitoring">Integrated monitoring</h3><p>The script could record straight to InfluxDB. This could be useful for long term analysis and assessing the impact of changing system properties – a new thermal interface compound, new fans etc.</p><h3 id="stall-speed-detection">Stall speed detection</h3><p>I mentioned earlier that the start speed of a given fan is greater than the stall speed. Providing there’s a start/restart mechanism, it should be possible to run the fans <em>even slower,</em> resulting in even less noise and dust.</p><h3 id="beat-frequencies">Beat frequencies</h3><p>The fans (2x radiator, 1x case) sometimes make a throbbing noise. This is due to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(acoustics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beat frequency</a> being emitted when the fans are close in speed.</p><p>It’s slightly annoying.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Among a certain tech set, Kubernetes has earned a reputation as an unnecessarily complicated time-sink that startups should avoid. Using Kubernetes with a small team is seen as a sign of over-engineering.</p>
<p>I’m guilty of taking <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgb/status/1568257167882436608">pithy jabs</a> myself.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I might gripe about Kubernetes sometimes, but it really is a great piece of technology. I highly recommend it to all my competitors.</p>— Paul Butler (@paulgb) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgb/status/1568257167882436608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2022</a></blockquote> 
<p>Despite my snark, “great piece of technology” truly is sincere; at the time of that post I had <a href="https://driftingin.space/posts/complexity-kubernetes">recently written</a> about how much of Kubernetes’ complexity is necessary for what it does.</p>
<p>We’ve been running Kubernetes in production for a few years now at <a href="https://jamsocket.com/">Jamsocket</a>, and I’ve found a good flow with it. Kubernetes serenity has been achieved internally. A big key to this has been <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgb/status/1743361919535260053">carving out a small chunk</a> of Kubernetes’ features and pretending the rest don’t exist.</p>
<p>This post started as an internal guide to the way we use Kubernetes, so it’s not meant to apply prescriptively to every startup; nonetheless I think it’s a good starting place for avoiding many of the sandbars in the vast seas of Kubernetes.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-kubernetes-at-all"><strong>Why use Kubernetes at all?</strong></h2>
<p>As I see it, Kubernetes is the best-travelled path if you want all three of these things:</p>
<ol>
<li>To run multiple processes/servers/scheduled jobs.</li>
<li>To run them redundantly and load balance across them.</li>
<li>To configure them, and the relationships between them, as code.</li>
</ol>
<p>At its most basic, Kubernetes is just a layer of abstraction that lets you think about a pool of computers if it were one (headless) computer. If that’s your use case, and you can avoid the other parts of it, you can get pretty far.</p>
<p>Some people have told me that #2 is overkill, startups shouldn’t focus on zero-downtime deploys or high availability. But we often do multiple deploys per day, and when our products break, our customer’s products break for <em>their</em> users. Even a minute of downtime is noticed by someone. Rolling deploys give us the confidence to deploy unceremoniously and often.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-use-kubernetes">How we use Kubernetes</h2>
<p>For background, <a href="https://jamsocket.com/">Jamsocket</a> is a service for dynamically spinning up processes that a web app can talk to. Kind of like AWS Lambda, but where the process lifetime is bound to a WebSocket connection instead of a single request/response.</p>
<p>We use Kubernetes to run the long-running processes that are needed to support that. The API server, container registry, controller, log collector, some DNS services, metrics collection, etc.</p>
<p>A few things we <em>don’t</em> use Kubernetes for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ephemeral processes themselves. We did for a hot minute very early on, but we quickly found it limiting (more on that later.)</li>
<li>Static/marketing sites. We use <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> for those. It’s more expensive, but so is the opportunity cost of an hour of engineering time at a small startup, and Vercel saves us more of that than it costs.</li>
<li>Anything that directly stores data we would be sad to lose. We do use some persistent volumes for caching or derived data, but otherwise we use a managed Postgres DB outside of the cluster and blob storage.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s also worth noting that we don’t administer Kubernetes ourselves — the main advantage of using Kubernetes is that we can outsource the infrastructure-level operation of it! We have been happy with Google Kubernetes Engine, and while the <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/google-domains-to-shut-down/">Google Domains fiasco</a> has shaken my faith in Google Cloud, I at least sleep soundly knowing that migrating to Amazon EKS would be relatively straightforward.</p>
<h2 id="things-we-readily-use">Things we readily use</h2>
<p>There are a few types of k8s resources we use without hesitation. I’m only listing resources here that we create explicitly; most of these resources implicitly create other resources (like Pods) that I will not mention but which we of course (indirectly) use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/">Deployments</a></strong>: Most of our pods are created through deployments. Every deployment critical to our service functioning has multiple replicas and rolling updates.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">Services</a></strong>: specifically, <code>ClusterIP</code> for internal services and <code>LoadBalancer</code> for external ones. We have avoided <code>NodePort</code> and <code>ExternalName</code> services, preferring for our DNS configuration to live outside of Kubernetes.</li>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/"><strong>CronJobs</strong></a>: for cleanup scripts and that sort of thing.</li>
<li><strong>ConfigMaps</strong> and <strong>Secrets</strong>: for passing data to the above resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="things-we-cautiously-use">Things we cautiously use</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>StatefulSet</strong> and <strong>PersistentVolumeClaim</strong>: we have used some StatefulSets. The configuration is a bit more convoluted than Deployments, but they can have a persistent volume across restarts. We prefer to persist important data in managed services outside of k8s. We don’t have a hard rule against volumes because sometimes it’s nice to persist e.g. a cache across a service restart, but I avoid them when possible because they can interact badly (deadlock) with rolling deploys.</li>
<li><strong>RBAC</strong>: we have used this in a few places, e.g. to give a service permission to refresh a secret. It adds enough complexity to our small cluster that I mostly avoid it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="things-we-actively-avoid">Things we actively avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hand-writing YAML</strong>. YAML has <a href="https://noyaml.com/">enough foot-guns</a> that I avoid it as much as possible. Instead, our Kubernetes resource definitions are created from TypeScript with <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Non-built-in resources and operators</strong>. I’ve <a href="https://driftingin.space/posts/complexity-kubernetes">written before</a> about how the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/">control loop</a> pattern is a double-edged sword: it’s the core idea that makes K8s robust, but it’s also a source of indirection and complexity. The <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/">operator pattern</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/">custom resources</a> allow third-party software to use Kubernetes’ robust infrastructure for its own control loops, which is a great idea in theory that I’ve found to be clunky in practice. Rather than <a href="https://cert-manager.io/">cert-manager</a>, we use <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy’s</a> certificate automation.</li>
<li><strong>Helm</strong>. Helm is a no-go because of the operators and no YAML rules, but I also just think that using unstructured string templating to generate something machine-parsable means introducing fragility for no gain. <a href="https://v2.helm.sh/docs/charts_tips_and_tricks/#using-the-include-function"><code>nindent</code></a> is like nails-on-a-chalkboard to me, I’m sorry.</li>
<li><strong>Anything with “mesh” in the name.</strong> I guess they’re useful to somebody, but not me, and not <a href="https://matduggan.com/k8s-service-meshes/">this guy</a> either.</li>
<li><strong>Ingress resources</strong>. I don’t have any battle scars from these, and I know some people use them productively, but a theme of our successful use of Kubernetes is avoiding adding unnecessary layers of indirection. Configuring Caddy works for us, so we just do that.</li>
<li><strong>Trying to replicate the entire k8s stack locally</strong>. Instead of using things like k3s or kind to replicate production exactly, we just use Docker Compose or our own scripts that start the subset of the system we actually care about in the moment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-human-should-never-wait-for-a-pod">A human should never wait for a pod</h2>
<p>Above I alluded to the fact that we briefly ran ephemeral, interactive, session-lived processes on Kubernetes. We quickly realized that Kubernetes is designed for robustness and modularity over container start times. As a general rule, my take is that Kubernetes is good for when you want to redundantly run some long-running processes, but if a human is ever waiting for a pod to start, <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgb/status/1684718880353042432">Kubernetes is the wrong choice</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll confess that I’m talking my book here, but at least it’s an open-source book: we use an MIT-licensed Rust orchestrator called <a href="https://plane.dev/">Plane</a> that we designed specifically for quickly scheduling and running processes for interactive workloads (i.e. ones with a human waiting on them).</p>
<h2 id="higher-level-abstractions">Higher-level abstractions</h2>
<p>For completeness, I should also mention that some of the Kubernetes alternatives that have popped up are quite good. Particularly if you don’t want or need requirement #3 from my initial list (the ability to specify infrastructure as code.) For <a href="https://y-sweet.cloud/">one of our products</a>, we opted to use <a href="https://railway.app/">Railway</a> rather than our k8s cluster, mainly for the preview environments. Some friends I respect highly swear by <a href="https://render.com/">Render</a> (I’ve dabbled but personally find Railway’s environment model cleaner.) I’m also partial to <a href="https://www.flightcontrol.dev/">Flight Control’s</a> bring-your-own-cloud approach.</p>
<p>For a lot of SaaS type apps, you’ll probably get pretty far on those. But if you meet the three needs listed at the beginning of this article and you take a disciplined approach to it, don’t let anybody tell you that you’re too early for Kubernetes.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1b55686/maybe_possible_bug_in_stdshared_mutex_on_windows/">https://old.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1b55686/maybe_possible_bug_in_stdshared_mutex_on_windows/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39581664">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A team at my company ran into a peculiar and unexpected behavior with <code>std::shared_mutex</code>. This behavior only occurs on Windows w/ MSVC. It does not occur with MinGW or on other platforms.</p>

<p>At this point the behavior is pretty well understood. The question isn't "how to work around this". The questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this a bug in <code>std::shared_mutex</code>?</li>
<li>Is this a bug in the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sync/slim-reader-writer--srw--locks">Windows SlimReaderWriter</a> implementation?</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm going to boldly claim "definitely yes" and "yes, or the SRW behavior needs to be documented". Your reaction is surely "it's never a bug, it's always user error". I appreciate that sentiment. Please hold that thought for just a minute and read on.</p>

<p>Here's the scenario:</p>

<ol>
<li>Main thread acquires <strong>exclusive</strong> lock</li>
<li>Main thread creates N child threads</li>
<li>Each child thread:

<ol>
<li>Acquires a <strong>shared</strong> lock</li>
<li>Yields until all children have acquired a shared lock</li>
<li>Releases the <strong>shared</strong> lock</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Main thread releases the <strong>exclusive</strong> lock</li>
</ol>

<p>This works <strong><em>most</em></strong> of the time. However 1 out of ~1000 times it "deadlocks". When it deadlocks exactly 1 child successfully acquires a shared lock and all other children block forever in <code>lock_shared()</code>. This behavior can be observed with <code>std::shared_mutex</code>, <code>std::shared_lock</code>/<code>std::unique_lock</code>, or simply calling <code>SRW</code> functions directly.</p>

<p>If the single child that succeeds calls <code>unlock_shared()</code> then the other children will wake up. However if we're waiting for all readers to acquire their shared lock then we will wait forever. Yes, we could achieve this behavior in other ways, that's not the question.</p>

<p>I made a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78090862/stdshared-mutexunlock-shared-blocks-even-though-there-are-no-active-exclus">StackOverflow post</a> that has had some good discussion. The behavior has been confirmed. However at this point we need a language lawyer, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/u/STL">u/STL</a>, or quite honestly Raymond Chen to declare whether this is "by design" or a bug.</p>

<p>Here is code that can be trivially compiled to repro the error.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;atomic&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;
#include &lt;shared_mutex&gt;
#include &lt;thread&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

struct ThreadTestData {
    int32_t numThreads = 0;
    std::shared_mutex sharedMutex = {};
    std::atomic&lt;int32_t&gt; readCounter = 0;
};

int DoStuff(ThreadTestData* data) {
    // Acquire reader lock
    data-&gt;sharedMutex.lock_shared();

    // wait until all read threads have acquired their shared lock
    data-&gt;readCounter.fetch_add(1);
    while (data-&gt;readCounter.load() != data-&gt;numThreads) {
        std::this_thread::yield();
    }

    // Release reader lock
    data-&gt;sharedMutex.unlock_shared();

    return 0;
}

int main() {
    int count = 0;
    while (true) {
        ThreadTestData data = {};
        data.numThreads = 5;

        // Acquire write lock
        data.sharedMutex.lock();

        // Create N threads
        std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;std::thread&gt;&gt; readerThreads;
        readerThreads.reserve(data.numThreads);
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; data.numThreads; ++i) {
            readerThreads.emplace_back(std::make_unique&lt;std::thread&gt;(DoStuff, &amp;data));
        }

        // Release write lock
        data.sharedMutex.unlock();

        // Wait for all readers to succeed
        for (auto&amp; thread : readerThreads) {
            thread-&gt;join();
        }

        // Cleanup
        readerThreads.clear();

        // Spew so we can tell when it's deadlocked
        count += 1;
        std::cout &lt;&lt; count &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Personally I don't think the function <code>lock_shared()</code> should ever be allowed to block forever when there is not an exclusive lock. That, to me, is a bug. One that only appears for <code>std::shared_mutex</code> in the <code>SRW</code>-based Windows MSVC implementation. <em>Maybe</em> it's allowed by the language spec? I'm not a language lawyer.</p>

<p>I'm also inclined to call the <code>SRW</code> behavior either a bug or something that should be documented. There's a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170301-00/?p=95615">2017 Raymond Chen</a> post that discusses EXACTLY this behavior. He implies it is user error. Therefore I'm inclined to boldly, and perhaps wrongly, call this is an <code>SRW</code> bug.</p>

<p>What do y'all think?</p>

<p>Edit: Updated to explicitly set <code>readCounter</code> to 0. That is not the problem.</p>

			<h3>Abstract</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>
					Multi-view stereo reconstruction (MVS) in the wild requires to first estimate the camera parameters e.g. intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. These are usually tedious and cumbersome to obtain, yet they are mandatory to triangulate corresponding pixels in 3D space, which is the core of all best performing MVS algorithms. In this work, we take an opposite stance and introduce DUSt3R, a radically novel paradigm for Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction of arbitrary image collections, i.e. operating without prior information about camera calibration nor viewpoint poses. We cast the pairwise reconstruction problem as a regression of pointmaps, relaxing the hard constraints of usual projective camera models. We show that this formulation smoothly unifies the monocular and binocular reconstruction cases. In the case where more than two images are provided, we further propose a simple yet effective global alignment strategy that expresses all pairwise pointmaps in a common reference frame. We base our network architecture on standard Transformer encoders and decoders, allowing us to leverage powerful pretrained models. Our formulation directly provides a 3D model of the scene as well as depth information, but interestingly, we can seamlessly recover from it, pixel matches, relative and absolute camera. Exhaustive experiments on all these tasks showcase that the proposed DUSt3R can unify various 3D vision tasks and set new SoTAs on monocular/multi-view depth estimation as well as relative pose estimation. 
					<i>In summary, DUSt3R makes geometric 3D vision tasks easy.</i>

<li>Support for SSE2-only processors in the 32 bit build</li>
  </ul>

<p><b>Future support for:</b></p><ul>
<li>Windows 2000</li>
<br>
<li>Ungoogled Chromium features (in progress)</li>
<br>
<li>WebGPU for D3D9 renderer</li>
<br>
<li>Manifest V2 (once removed by Google)</li>
<br>
<li>...and more! If there's a feature you want, which cannot be replicated by a Manifest v2/v3 extension, please ask!</li>
  </ul>


<p><strong>It is important to note that Google Chrome is proprietary software, while Supermium, like Chromium is open source. This means that while similar, Google Chrome's feature set cannot be reproduced perfectly by Supermium.</strong></p><p><img src="https://win32subsystem.live/supermium/images/canada-ball_2X.png" <="" img="">

<p dir="auto">Hancho is a simple, pleasant build system with few moving parts.</p>
<p dir="auto">Hancho fits comfortably in 500 lines of Python and requires no installation, just copy-paste it into your source tree.</p>
<p dir="auto">Hancho is inspired by Ninja (for speed and simplicity) and Bazel (for syntax and extensibility).</p>
<p dir="auto">Like Ninja, it knows nothing about your build tools and is only trying to assemble and run commands as fast as possible.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unlike Ninja, you don't need a separate build rule invocation for every single output file.</p>
<p dir="auto">Like Bazel, you invoke build rules by calling them as if they were functions with keyword arguments.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unlike Bazel, you can create build rules that call arbitary Python code (for better or worse).</p>
<p dir="auto">Hancho should suffice for small to medium sized projects.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This is the story of the most unbelievable demo I've been given in world of open source. You can't make this stuff up.</p>

<p>It was 2005, and I felt like I was in the eye of a hurricane. I was an independent performance consultant and Sun Microsystems had just released DTrace, a tool that could instrument all software. This gave performance analysts like myself X-ray vision. While I was busy writing and publishing advanced performance tools using DTrace (my open source <a href="https://www.brendangregg.com/dtracetoolkit.html">DTraceToolkit</a> and other <a href="https://www.brendangregg.com/dtrace.html">DTrace tools</a>, aka scripts), I noticed something odd: I was producing more DTrace tools than were coming out of Sun itself. Perhaps there was some internal project that was consuming all their DTrace expertise?</p>

<center><img src="https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/images/2007/Bin096_01c.png" width="626"><br><span size="-3"><i>DTraceToolkit v0.96 tools (2006)</i></span></center>

<p>As I wasn't a Sun Microsystems employee I wasn't privy to Sun's internal projects. However, I was doing training and consulting for Sun, helping their customers with system administration and performance. Sun sometimes invited me to their own customer meetings and other events I might be interested in, as a local expert. I was living in Sydney, Australia.</p>

<p>This time I was told that there was a Very Important Person visiting from the US whom I'd want to meet. I didn't recognize the name, but was told that he was a DTrace expert and developer at Sun, and was on a world tour demonstrating Sun's new DTrace-based product. Ah-hah – this must be the internal project!</p>

<p>But this would be no ordinary project. I'd seen some amazing technologies from Sun, but I'd never seen a developer on a world tour. This was going to be big, and would likely blow away my earlier DTrace work.</p>

<p>The VIP was returning to Sydney for a few days before going to the next Australian city, so we agreed to meet at the Sun Sydney office.</p>

<h2>The Meeting</h2>

<p>The DTrace expert arrived wearing casual business attire and a heavy American accent, and seemed a bit weary from his world tour. He had just been to South Africa and New Zealand, and listed other countries and cities he was heading to next. Two other Australian Sun staff joined the meeting, and one introduced me with:</p>

<p>"Brendan teaches some classes for us, and has been doing some DTrace stuff.”</p>

<p>Low-key introductions are the norm in Australia (especially for Australians) and I wondered whether he knew of this cultural difference. Another difference was that there were few roles in Australia for engineers in 2005, unlike the US. The Sun Microsystems Australia jobs, for example, were all in support and none in development, and other tech giants had not yet arrived. So back then in Australia you could find amazing engineers doing whatever roles were available.</p>

<p>I tried to expand on the "stuff" a bit by saying that I’d written the DTraceToolkit, but he wasn't impressed. He didn't recognize my name, nor had he heard of the DTraceToolkit. To him, I was just some random guy.</p>

<p>He was kind enough to give me a quick demo anyway. His DTrace product was an add-on for a larger Sun GUI that I was already familiar with. After it loaded, he showed how you could run one of several DTrace tools by double clicking an icon. Either the raw output would be printed in a separate window, or the results would be shown as a line graph. This seemed <strong>quite underwhelming</strong>. The GUI already had this functionality: Showing the raw output of tools or drawing a line graph. I was hoping for a new GUI feature.</p>

<p>The only new work was the tools themselves, of which there were several. He gave a quick sales pitch about the new and amazing observability they provided, something he must have said many times to impress customers. I got the feeling he wasn't expecting me to properly appreciate their value. </p>

<p>But I <em>did</em> understand these tools, since I had coded similar functionality for my own DTraceToolkit. They were useful, but...I was expecting a hurricane of awesome <em>new</em> DTrace content.</p>

<p>"I've done these before – I've written tools that do these things myself!"</p>

<p>"Yeah, sure." He didn’t quite say it, but gave me a look like he didn't really believe me, or that I could even truly understand what they were. This was an important innovation by Sun Microsystems, a US-based multinational company worth billions. I was just some random Aussie.</p>

<h2>Socket Tracing</h2>

<p>I browsed the GUI icons for something new, and the closest was a tool for tracing socket I/O. I had tried this in 2004 (<a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/DTrace/socketsnoop.d">socketsnoop.d</a>) and published it as open source, but my tool was incomplete: I didn't have access to the kernel source code so I had to figure out everything the hard way using black box analysis. It worked for most TCP traffic types but not others, which I warned about in the script comments. I'd also not included it in the DTraceToolkit yet as I didn't consider it finished. So of all the tools he had, I was most interested to see this one. Sun could do a much better job just by referring to the source code they were instrumenting, and actually finish this tool.</p>

<p>"Can I see the socket I/O script?". I fired up a terminal. He looked alarmed at first, as if I wasn't supposed to look behind the curtain, then realized another selling feature: "Well, sure, you could even add more tools to the GUI!" and after a pause, added "if you have them". Sure, I have them all right. He gave me a path to start looking under, and after a bit of searching I found the directory with all the tools he had been demoing.</p>

<p>The tools all had familiar names. One was even called socketsnoop.d. A new possibility dawned on me.</p>

<p>No way.</p>

<p>I printed socketsnoop.d. The screen filled with <em>my own script</em>. It was the same incomplete attempt I had hacked up a year earlier, and published as open source. It included some weird code that only made sense when I wrote it (use of PFORMAT, prior to defaultargs) and was written in my earlier coding style. I was looking at <em>my own fucking script</em>.</p>

<p>"This is MY script."</p>

<p>I printed the other tools and saw the same – they were <em>all mine</em>. This hot new Sun product that Mr. VIP was touring the world showing off was actually just my own open source tools.</p>

<p>My jaw was on the floor. He didn't seem to believe me. </p>

<h2>You Can't Do That</h2>

<p>I used grep to search all his tools for my name, which was in the header comment of all my tools, to prove beyond a doubt that these were mine. But I found nothing. My name had been stripped.</p>

<p>Some of my tools had even included the line:</p>

<pre># Author: Brendan Gregg  [Sydney, Australia]
</pre>

<p>And now, here he was, in Sydney, Australia, trying to sell Brendan Gregg's tools to Brendan Gregg.</p>

<p>One of the Australian Sun staff interrupted: "Those say copyright Sun Microsystems." Most of my tools had my own copyright and a GPLv2 or CDDL license. But these only had Sun's standard copyright message, and the open source licenses had been stripped.</p>

<p>"You deleted my name! And the copyrights and licenses!"</p>

<p>The other Aussie added, to the VIP: "You <b>can't</b> do that." A silence fell over the room as the magnitude of what had happened sunk in. While some at Sun were encouraging open source contributions and building a community, others were ripping off that same community. Taking their work, changing the licence and copyrights, and then selling it.</p>

<p>The VIP wasn't prepared for this and had a look of confusion. He didn't say much, other than that he didn't know what had happened, and that he may have gotten the tools from someone else already like this (ie, don't blame me). He seemed to be only half believing what we were saying.</p>

<p>The meeting ended quickly. I suggested that he get newer copies of my tools, directly from the DTraceToolkit, since these older versions from my homepage were out of date, and some had errors that I had already fixed. I also reminded him to keep my name, copyright, and license on all of them.</p>

<p>In his defense, perhaps the meeting may have gone differently had I not been given a low-key Australian introduction. That's an Australian cultural problem (tall poppy syndrome). To an Australian, introductions in the US can sound boastful, but they can also be useful as a quick way to share one's specialties.</p>

<h2>Other Cases</h2>

<p>Of all the tools I had published as open source, I still can't believe socketsnoop.d was included. It wasn't even very good. Later on I wrote much better socket tools (in my <a href="https://www.brendangregg.com/dtrace.html">DTrace</a> and <a href="https://www.brendangregg.com/bpf-performance-tools-book.html">BPF</a> books).</p>

<p>A few years later, Apple added dozens of my tools to OS X. They left my name, copyright, and CDDL open source license intact, and even improved and enhanced some of them. Years later, Oracle did the same for Oracle Solaris 11, and the BSD community did for FreeBSD. My thanks to all of you.</p>

<p>You might say that this wasn't really Sun the company doing this, but rather, a careless individual. But there was something in Sun's culture that contributed to this kind of carelessness. It was something I and my consulting colleagues had run into before: The belief at Sun that only Sun could make good use of its own technologies, and anything created outside of Sun was trash. When these Sun employees found something that was good, they were inclined to assume it came from Sun, and it was therefore safe to reuse and rebrand (and relicense) as they assumed they already held the copyrights.</p>

<p>There were also others at Sun that did try hard to do the right thing by me and my work. On at least four other occasions my DTraceToolkit was built into observability products, without stripping licenses. (In one case they wanted to relicense to GPL, and talked to me and Sun legal about it, but that's another story.)</p>

<!-- You might wonder why I didn't talk about this first case publicly at the time. I'd already informed them of the problem privately and how to fix it, so there wasn't more to say. Also, Sun was the number one employer in town, and to be publicly critical could be career ending.  -->

<p>This also wasn't the last time someone unwittingly tried to sell me my own work, it was just the first. I've learned to not tell sales people that I invented what they are showing me, as they then give me funny looks like I'm a crazy person, but instead to simply say "I have a lot of experience with that technology" and leave it at that.</p>

<p>I'm reminded of this first case since my BPF tools are now appearing in observability products, and will grow to a scale much bigger than my DTrace tools. I'll write about it more in future posts, but my immediate advice to developers is this: Please try to build upon my BPF tools and the bcc libraries (either bcc Python or bcc libbpf-tool versions) instead of rewriting them, and fetch regular updates. This is because they are works-in-progress, and rewriting (forking) them divides engineering resources and may have your customers using out of date versions. I explain in more detail in <a href="https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2021-07-03/how-to-add-bpf-observability.html">How To Add eBPF Observability To Your Product</a>.
Note that I think my flame graph software is different: Since it is a simple and finished algorithm that doesn't need much maintenance, I don't see a big problem with people rewriting it. (It is nice to get some thanks, however, just as I <a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph/blob/a258e78f17abdf2ce21c2515cfe8306a44774e2a/flamegraph.pl#L58">have</a> <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html#Origin">done</a> for those that inspired flame graphs.)</p>

<!-- We are better off with all the wood behind one arrow. -->

<p>As for the unbelievable demo: This wasn't the great DTrace product I imagined when hearing about a world tour. It was, in fact, my own tools. I suspect that it's not uncommon for an open source developer to discover, at some point, that their own code has been rebranded. But the circumstance in this case may be a little unusual. A US developer got a world tour for software he didn't write, which included giving a sales pitch and demo in Australia, unwittingly, to the author. I don't think he even said thank you.</p>

<p>Dear Duxbury Community,</p>
<p>This week brings sad news for our Duxbury Systems family. Our colleague, David Holladay, passed away in a hospital on Thursday, February 15th, following an accident at home that morning. David was a cancer survivor and valiantly battled multiple medical problems over his last five years.</p>
<p>David was an early innovator in braille software. Together, he and his wife, Caryn Navy, founded Raised Dot Computing (later Braille Planet) in 1981. David’s early work on Apple II computers was groundbreaking in support of accessibility for blind users through speech and production of braille and of print from braille input. He went on to support production of print math from Nemeth Code mathematics braille. Later work at Raised Dot Computing culminated in the introduction of MegaDots, an innovative product with unparalleled support for braille formats.</p>
<p>David and Caryn joined Duxbury Systems in 1999 and have been part of the family ever since. David’s work at Duxbury focused largely on extending the reach of DBT to many, many countries and languages around the world. Though confined to bed over the last several years of his life, David’s passion for braille wouldn’t allow him to rest. He was working until his very last day.</p>
<p>It is our belief that the larger braille world will miss David as much as we do here at Duxbury.</p>
<hr>
<p>David’s funeral will be at Congregation Shalom in Chelmsford Massachusetts at noon Eastern Standard Time on Monday, with burial at 1 PM at Beth El Cemetery in Chelmsford.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am responding to the devastating announcement about my dearest husband David Holladay’s passing, to add the information on streaming his funeral service.</p>
<p>Streaming of the service, scheduled for noon Eastern Standard Time on Monday, Feb. 19, will be available during or after the service at: <a href="https://congregationshalom.org/worship-2/">congregationshalom.org/worship-2/</a>.</p>
<p>Press the Play button just after the level 3 heading “Live streaming of services is now available!” Note that if your screen reader does not recognize that as a button, you can use an alternative, such as a simulated left click.</p>
<p>With warmest regards for the community that meant so much to David,<br>
Caryn</p>

A decade after his death, the resulting algorithm lets Anderson type in prompts before an AI Reed begins “riffing” written responses back to her, in prose and verse.</p><figure id="87ae3571-b6b1-41ac-bb2e-0d8f48ca2222" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09812979b19fc9c0a3fac3a0eb076cc135e87f55/0_0_3200_2196/master/3200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09812979b19fc9c0a3fac3a0eb076cc135e87f55/0_0_3200_2196/master/3200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09812979b19fc9c0a3fac3a0eb076cc135e87f55/0_0_3200_2196/master/3200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09812979b19fc9c0a3fac3a0eb076cc135e87f55/0_0_3200_2196/master/3200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09812979b19fc9c0a3fac3a0eb076cc135e87f55/0_0_3200_2196/master/3200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09812979b19fc9c0a3fac3a0eb076cc135e87f55/0_0_3200_2196/master/3200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09812979b19fc9c0a3fac3a0eb076cc135e87f55/0_0_3200_2196/master/3200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="305.38125" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed in Spain in 2009.</span> Photograph: Robin Towsend/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>“I’m totally 100%, sadly addicted to this,” she laughs. “I still am, after all this time.

Anderson won’t be making the trip this time but will dial in for a few talks – the steady ping of emails arriving throughout our conversation hint at the 76-year-old’s relentless schedule.</p><p>I wonder if, after being given a lifetime achievement award at the Grammys in February, the prospect of these algorithms continuing to make “Laurie Anderson” art beyond her own lifetime has caused her to reflect on her legacy.</p><p>“Oh, why not? I mean, that doesn’t bother me. I don’t feel that attached to time anyway, you know?</p><p>“When people die and you hear their words or hear their music or read their things, it’s like they’re alive, you know? In many ways, there they <em>are</em>. You can say that about Dostoevsky, Plato, you know, <em>the Buddha</em>. People leave things around, and so I feel fine about that. I mean, we’re just mayflies, really.”</p><p>When the ghost in the machine has finished thinking, it serves up some fresh Lou Reed-ish lyrics inspired by my bus stop:</p><blockquote>
 <p><em>The street and the sky<br>When you die<br>I’ll be sitting in an idling bus<br>On my way to work<br>And no more<br>Than ten minutes before<br>The last train of the day<br>Pulls into the city, the light<br>Dim, insubstantial at first<br>Then less than a sliver of that<br>In half a second it’s all<br>You’ve got to live it, as they used to say<br>So much can go wrong<br>But why did you think this<br>Was a good idea<br>Don’t you get paid enough<br>To pay taxes? Why not play<br>Some tennis or take up quilting<br>Or improve the sanitation<br>Of this vast and sordidized<br>Island from which you sail<br>Is it such a wonder you’re alive<br>After all this sugar-fied waste<br>One cigarette, a glass of wine<br>Tell me, do you like it<br>How does it make you feel<br>Do you like the bitter taste</em></p>
</blockquote><p>I ask if Reed referenced “quilting” a lot in his writing, and Anderson laughs with her usual mix of playful and profound:</p><p>“Hah, I think that might be the first time.”</p><ul>

<p>I saw the <a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/one-billion-row-challenge/">One Billion Row Challenge</a> a couple of weeks ago, and it thoroughly <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd-sniped</a> me, so I went to <em>Go</em> solve it.</p>

<p>I’m late to the party, as the original competition was in January. It was also in Java. I’m not particularly interested in Java, but I’ve been interested in <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/goawk/#improving-performance">optimising</a> <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/goawk-compiler-vm/">Go</a> <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/go-version-performance/">code</a> <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/count-words/#go">for a while</a>.</p>

<p>This challenge was particularly simple: process a text file of weather station names and temperatures, and for each weather station, print out the minimum, mean, and maximum. There are a few <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc?tab=readme-ov-file#rules-and-limits">other constraints</a> to make it simpler, though I ignored the Java-specific ones.</p>

<p>Here are a few lines of example input:</p>

<div><pre><code>Hamburg;12.0
Bulawayo;8.9
Palembang;38.8
St. John's;15.2
Cracow;12.6
...
</code></pre></div>

<p>The only catch: the input file has one billion rows (lines). That’s about 13GB of data. I’ve already figured out that <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/io-is-no-longer-the-bottleneck/">disk I/O is no longer the bottleneck</a> – it’s usually memory allocations and parsing that slow things down in a program like this.</p>

<p><strong>This article describes the nine solutions I wrote in Go, each faster than the previous.</strong> The first, a simple and idiomatic solution, runs in 1 minute 45 seconds on my machine, while the last one runs in about 4 seconds. As I go, I’ll show how I used Go’s profiler to see where the time was being spent.</p>

<p>The run-down of solutions is as follows, slowest to fastest:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r1.go">r1: simple and idiomatic</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r2.go">r2: map with pointer values</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r3.go">r3: parse temperatures by hand</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r4.go">r4: fixed point integers</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r5.go">r5: avoid <code>bytes.Cut</code></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r6.go">r6: avoid <code>bufio.Scanner</code></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r7.go">r7: custom hash table</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r8.go">r8: parallelise r1</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r9.go">r9: parallelise r7</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I wanted each of the solutions to be portable Go using only the standard library: no assembly, no <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a>, and no memory-mapped files. And 4 seconds, or 3.2GB/s, was fast enough for me. For comparison, the fastest, heavily-optimised Java solution runs in just under a second on my machine – not bad!</p>

<p>There are several other Go solutions out there already, and at least one <a href="https://www.bytesizego.com/blog/one-billion-row-challenge-go">nice write-up</a>. Mine is faster than some solutions, but slightly slower than the <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/tree/main/src/main/go/AlexanderYastrebov">fastest one</a>. However, I didn’t look at any of these before writing mine – I wanted my solutions to be independent.</p>

<p>If you just care about the numbers, <a href="#table-of-results">skip down to the table of results</a>.</p>

<h2 id="baseline">Baseline</h2>

<p>Here are a few different baseline measurements to set the stage. First, how long does it take to just read 13GB of data, using <code>cat</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ time cat measurements.txt &gt;/dev/null
0m1.052s
</code></pre></div>

<p>Note that that’s a best-of-five measurement, so I’m allowing the file to be cached. Who knows whether Linux will allow all 13GB to be kept in disk cache, though presumably it does, because the first time it took closer to 6 seconds.</p>

<p>For comparison, to actually do something with the file is significantly slower: <code>wc</code> takes almost a minute:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ time wc measurements.txt 
 1000000000  1179173106 13795293380 measurements.txt
0m55.710s
</code></pre></div>

<p>For a simple solution to the actual problem, I’d probably start with AWK. <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/1brc.awk">This solution</a> uses Gawk, because sorting the output is easier with its <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Array-Sorting-Functions.html"><code>asorti</code> function</a>. I’m using the <code>-b</code> option to use “characters as bytes” mode, which makes things a bit faster:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ time gawk -b -f 1brc.awk measurements.txt &gt;measurements.out
7m35.567s
</code></pre></div>

<p>I’m sure I can beat 7 minutes with even a simple Go solution, so let’s start there.</p>

<p>I’m going to start by optimising the sequential, single-core version (solutions 1-7), and then parallelise it (solutions 8 and 9). All my results are done using Go 1.21.5 on a linux/amd64 laptop with a fast SSD drive and 32GB of RAM.</p>

<p>Many of my solutions, and most of the fastest solutions, assume valid input. For example, that the temperatures have exactly one decimal digit. Several of my solutions will cause a runtime panic, or produce incorrect output, if the input isn’t valid.</p>

<h2 id="solution-1-simple-and-idiomatic-go">Solution 1: simple and idiomatic Go</h2>

<p>I wanted my <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r1.go">first version</a> to be simple, straight-forward code using the tools in the Go standard library: <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/bufio#Scanner"><code>bufio.Scanner</code></a> to read the lines, <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/strings#Cut"><code>strings.Cut</code></a> to split on the <code>';'</code>, <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/strconv#ParseFloat"><code>strconv.ParseFloat</code></a> to parse the temperatures, and an ordinary Go <code>map</code> to accumulate the results.</p>

<p>I’ll include this first solution in full (but after that, show only the interesting bits):</p>

<p><strong>This basic solution processes the one billion rows in 1 minute and 45 seconds.</strong> A definite improvement over 7 minutes for the AWK solution.</p>

<h2 id="solution-2-map-with-pointer-values">Solution 2: map with pointer values</h2>

<p>I’d learned doing my <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/count-words/#go">count-words</a> program that we’re doing a bunch more hashing than we need to. For each line, we’re hashing the string twice: once when we try to fetch the value from the map, and once when we update the map.</p>

<p>To avoid that, we can use a <code>map[string]*stats</code> (pointer values) and update the pointed-to struct, instead of a <code>map[string]stats</code> and updating the hash table itself.</p>

<p>However, I first wanted to confirm that using the Go profiler. It only takes a <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/f72b34cb31854ed50e73ac7f89adff0f422f42e5/main.go#L59-L67">few lines</a> to add CPU profiling to a Go program.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ ./go-1brc -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -revision=1 measurements-10000000.txt &gt;measurements-10000000.out
Processed 131.6MB in 965.888929ms
$ go tool pprof -http=: cpu.prof
...
</code></pre></div>

<p>Those commands produced the following profile of solution 1, run over a cut-down 10 million row input file:</p>

<p><img src="https://benhoyt.com/images/go-1brc-profile-r1.png" alt="Profile of solution r1"></p>

<p>Map operations are taking a full 30% of the time: 12.24% for assign and 17.35% for lookup. We should be able to get rid of most of the map assign time by using a pointer value.</p>

<p>As a side note, this profile image also shows us where all the rest of the time is going:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scanning lines with <code>Scanner.Scan</code></li>
  <li>Finding the <code>';'</code> with <code>strings.Cut</code></li>
  <li>Parsing the temperature with <code>strconv.ParseFloat</code></li>
  <li>Calling <code>Scanner.Text</code>, which allocates a string for the line</li>
</ul>

<p>In any case, my <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r2.go">second solution</a> is just a small tweak to the map operations:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>stationStats</span> <span>:=</span> <span>make</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>*</span><span>stats</span><span>)</span>
<span>scanner</span> <span>:=</span> <span>bufio</span><span>.</span><span>NewScanner</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span>
<span>for</span> <span>scanner</span><span>.</span><span>Scan</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
    <span>s</span> <span>:=</span> <span>stationStats</span><span>[</span><span>station</span><span>]</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>s</span> <span>==</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>stationStats</span><span>[</span><span>station</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>stats</span><span>{</span>
            <span>min</span><span>:</span>   <span>temp</span><span>,</span>
            <span>max</span><span>:</span>   <span>temp</span><span>,</span>
            <span>sum</span><span>:</span>   <span>temp</span><span>,</span>
            <span>count</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>min</span> <span>=</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>min</span><span>,</span> <span>temp</span><span>)</span>
        <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>max</span> <span>=</span> <span>max</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>,</span> <span>temp</span><span>)</span>
        <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span> <span>+=</span> <span>temp</span>
        <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>++</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In the common case where the station exists in the map, we now only do one map operation, <code>s := stationStats[station]</code>, so that hashing the station name and accessing the hash table only has to be done once. If it’s in the map already – the common case in one billion rows – we update the existing pointed-to struct.</p>

<p>It doesn’t help a ton, but it is something: <strong>using pointer values in the map takes our time down from 1 minute 45 seconds to 1 minute 31 seconds.</strong></p>

<h2 id="solution-3-avoid-strconvparsefloat">Solution 3: avoid strconv.ParseFloat</h2>

<p>My <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r3.go">third solution</a> is where things get a bit more hard-core: parse the temperature using custom code instead of <code>strconv.ParseFloat</code>. The standard library function handles a ton of edge cases we don’t need to support for the simple temperatures our input has: 2 or 3 digits in the format <code>1.2</code> or <code>34.5</code> (and some with a minus sign in front).</p>

<p>Also, <code>strconv.ParseFloat</code> took a <code>string</code> argument, and now that we’re no longer calling that, we can get away with using the byte slice directly from <code>Scanner.Bytes</code>, instead of allocating and copying a string with <code>Scanner.Text</code>.</p>

<p>Now we parse the temperature this way:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>negative</span> <span>:=</span> <span>false</span>
<span>index</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>if</span> <span>tempBytes</span><span>[</span><span>index</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>'-'</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>index</span><span>++</span>
    <span>negative</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>temp</span> <span>:=</span> <span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>tempBytes</span><span>[</span><span>index</span><span>]</span> <span>-</span> <span>'0'</span><span>)</span> <span>// parse first digit</span>
<span>index</span><span>++</span>
<span>if</span> <span>tempBytes</span><span>[</span><span>index</span><span>]</span> <span>!=</span> <span>'.'</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>temp</span> <span>=</span> <span>temp</span><span>*</span><span>10</span> <span>+</span> <span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>tempBytes</span><span>[</span><span>index</span><span>]</span><span>-</span><span>'0'</span><span>)</span> <span>// parse optional second digit</span>
    <span>index</span><span>++</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>index</span><span>++</span> <span>// skip '.'</span>
<span>temp</span> <span>+=</span> <span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>tempBytes</span><span>[</span><span>index</span><span>]</span><span>-</span><span>'0'</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>10</span> <span>// parse decimal digit</span>
<span>if</span> <span>negative</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>temp</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>temp</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Not pretty, but not exactly rocket science either. <strong>This gets our time down from to 1 minute 31 seconds to under a minute: 55.8 seconds.</strong></p>

<h2 id="solution-4-fixed-point-integers">Solution 4: fixed point integers</h2>

<p>Back in the olden days, floating point instructions were a <em>lot</em> slower than integer ones. These days, they’re only a little slower, but it’s probably worth avoiding them if we can.</p>

<p>For this problem, each temperature has a single decimal digit, so it’s easy to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic">fixed point</a> integers to represent them. For example, we can represent 34.5 as the integer 345. Then at the end, just before we print out the results, we convert them back to floats.</p>

<p>So my <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r4.go">fourth solution</a> is basically the same as solution 3, but with the <code>stats</code> struct field as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>stats</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>min</span><span>,</span> <span>max</span><span>,</span> <span>count</span> <span>int32</span>
    <span>sum</span>             <span>int64</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, when printing out the results, we need to divide by 10:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>mean</span> <span>:=</span> <span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>10</span>
<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>output</span><span>,</span> <span>"%s=%.1f/%.1f/%.1f"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>station</span><span>,</span> <span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>min</span><span>)</span><span>/</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>mean</span><span>,</span> <span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>)</span><span>/</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I’ve used 32-bit integers for minimum and maximum temperatures, as the highest we’ll probably have is about 500 (50 degrees Celsius). We could use <code>int16</code>, but from previous experience, modern 64-bit CPUs are slightly slower when handling 16-bit integers than 32-bit ones. In my tests just now it didn’t seem to make a measurable difference, but I opted for 32-bit anyway.</p>

<p>To make <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r5.go">solution 5</a> I recorded another profile (of solution 4):</p>

<p><img src="https://benhoyt.com/images/go-1brc-profile-r4.png" alt="Profile of solution r4"></p>

<p>Okay, now it’s getting harder. The map operations dominate, and moving to a custom hash table will be a bit tricky. So will getting rid of the <code>bufio.Scanner</code>. Let’s procrastinate and get rid of the <code>bytes.Cut</code>.</p>

<p>I thought of a simple way to save time. If we look at a line, for example:</p>



<p>It’s going to be faster to parse the temperature from the end and find the <code>';'</code> there than to scan through the whole station name to look for the <code>';'</code>. This rather ugly code does just that:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>end</span> <span>:=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>)</span>
<span>tenths</span> <span>:=</span> <span>int32</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>[</span><span>end</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>-</span> <span>'0'</span><span>)</span>

<h2 id="solution-6-avoid-bufioscanner">Solution 6: avoid bufio.Scanner</h2>

<p>Now we’re going to try to get rid of the <code>bufio.Scanner</code>. If you think about it, to find the end of each line, the scanner has to look through all the bytes to find the newline character. Then we process many of the bytes again to parse the temperature and find the <code>';'</code>. So let’s try to combine those steps and throw <code>bufio.Scanner</code> out the window.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r6.go">solution 6</a> we allocate a 1MB buffer to read the file in large chunks, look for the last newline in the chunk to ensure we’re not chopping a line in half, and then process each chunk. That looks like this:</p>

<h2 id="solution-7-custom-hash-table">Solution 7: custom hash table</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r7.go">Solution 7</a> is where we get real. We’re going to implement a custom hash table instead of using Go’s <code>map</code>. This has two advantages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We can hash the station name as we look for the <code>';'</code>, avoiding processing bytes twice.</li>
  <li>We can store each key in our hash table as a byte slice, avoiding the need to convert each key to a <code>string</code> (which will allocate and copy for every line).</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve written about <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/hash-table-in-c/">how to implement a hash table in C</a>, but I’ve also implemented a custom <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/counter/blob/master/counter.go">“counter” hash table in Go</a>, which is where I pulled this implementation from.</p>

<p>It’s a simple implementation that uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function#FNV-1a_hash">FNV-1a</a> hash algorithm with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probing">linear probing</a>: if there’s a collision, use the next empty slot.</p>

<p>To simplify, I just pre-allocate a large number of hash buckets (I’ve used 100,000), to avoid having to write logic to resize the table. My code will panic if the table gets more than half full. I measured that we get around 2% hash collisions.</p>

<p>It’s a bunch more code this time – hash table setup, the hashing itself, and the table probing and insertion:</p>

<h2 id="solution-8-process-chunks-in-parallel">Solution 8: process chunks in parallel</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r8.go">solution 8</a> I wanted to add some parallelism. However, I thought I’d go back to the simple and idiomatic code from my first solution, which uses <code>bufio.Scanner</code> and <code>strconv.ParseFloat</code>, and parallelise that. Then we can see whether optimising or parallelising gives better results – and in solution 9 we’ll do both.</p>

<p>It’s straight-forward to parallelise a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">map-reduce</a> problem like this: split the file into similar-sized chunks (one for each CPU core), fire up a thread (in Go, a goroutine) to process each chunk, and then merge the results at the end.</p>

<p><strong>Processing the input file in parallel provides a huge win over r1, taking the time from 1 minute 45 seconds to 24.3 seconds.</strong> For comparison, the previous “optimised non-parallel” version, solution 7, took 25.8 seconds. So for this case, parallelisation is a bit faster than optimisation – and quite a bit simpler.</p>

<h2 id="solution-9-all-optimisations-plus-parallelisation">Solution 9: all optimisations plus parallelisation</h2>

<p>For <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r8.go">solution 9</a>, our last attempt, we’ll simply combine all the previous optimisations from r1 through r7 with the parallelisation we did in r8.</p>

<p>I’ve used the same <code>splitFile</code> function from r8, and the rest of the code is just copied from r7, so there’s nothing new to show here. Except the results … <strong>this final version cut down the time from 24.3 seconds to 3.99 seconds, a huge win.</strong></p>

<p>Interestingly, because all the real processing is now in one big function, <code>r9ProcessPart</code>, the profile graph is no longer particularly helpful. Here’s what it looks like now:</p>

<p><img src="https://benhoyt.com/images/go-1brc-profile-r9.png" alt="Profile of solution r9"></p>

<p>As you can see, 82% of the time is being spent in <code>r9ProcessPart</code>, with <code>bytes.Equal</code> taking 13%, and the file reading taking the remaining 5%.</p>

<p>If we want to profile further, we have to dive deeper than the function level that the graph view gives us, and use the source view. Here’s the inner loop:</p>

<p><img src="https://benhoyt.com/images/go-1brc-profile-r9-source.png" alt="Profile of solution r9 - source view"></p>

<p>I find this report confusing. Why does <code>if items[hashIndex].key == nil</code> show as taking 5.01s, but the call to <code>bytes.Equal</code> shows as only 390ms. Surely a slice lookup is much cheaper than a function call? If you are a Go performance expert and can help me interpret it, I’m all ears!</p>

<p>In any case, I’m sure there are crazier optimisations I could do, but I decided I’d leave it there. Processing a billion rows in 4 seconds, or 250 million rows per second, was good enough for me.</p>

<h2 id="table-of-results">Table of results</h2>

<p>Below is a table of all my Go solutions in one place, in addition to the fastest Go and fastest Java solutions. Each result is the best-of-five time for running the solution against the same billion-row input.</p>

<p>I’m in the same ballpark as <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/blob/main/src/main/go/AlexanderYastrebov/calc.go">Alexander Yastrebov’s Go version</a>. His solution looks similar to mine: break the file into chunks, use a custom hash table (he even uses FNV hashing), and parse temperatures as integers. However, he uses memory-mapped files, which I’d ruled out for portability reasons – I’m guessing that’s why his is a bit faster.</p>

<p>Thomas Wuerthinger (with <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/blob/c92346790e8548f52e81254227efc935356e5e53/src/main/java/dev/morling/onebrc/CalculateAverage_thomaswue.java#L32-L37">credit to others</a>) created the <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/blob/main/src/main/java/dev/morling/onebrc/CalculateAverage_thomaswue.java">fastest overall solution</a> to the original challenge in Java. His runs in under a second on my machine, 4x as fast as my Go version. In addition to parallel processing and memory-mapped files, it looks like he’s using unrolled loops, non-branching parsing code, and other low-level tricks.</p>

<p>It looks like Thomas is the founder of and a <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/commits?author=thomaswue">significant contributor</a> to <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>, a faster Java Virtual Machine with ahead-of-time compilation. So he’s definitely an expert in his field. Nice work Thomas and co!</p>



<p>Does any of this matter?</p>

<p>For the majority of day-to-day programming tasks, simple and idiomatic code is usually the best place to start. If you’re calculating statistics over a billion temperatures, and you just need the answer once, 1 minute 45 seconds is probably fine.</p>

<p>But if you’re building a data processing pipeline, if you can make your code 4 times as fast, or even 26 times as fast, you’ll not only make users happier, you’ll save a lot on compute costs – if the system is being well loaded, your compute costs could be 1/4 or 1/26 of the original!</p>

<p>Or, if you’re building a runtime like GraalVM, or an interpreter like my <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk">GoAWK</a>, this level of performance really does matter: if you speed up the interpreter, all your users’ programs run that much faster too.</p>

<p>Plus, it’s just fun writing code that gets the most out of your machine.</p>

<p>I’d love it if you <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/benhoyt/">sponsored me on GitHub</a> – it will motivate me to work on my open source projects and write more good content. Thanks!</p>

<!-- cache hit 47:single/related:203b22287e8a089f569cc48ef325f0f3 --><!-- empty -->
<p>Nine days after a Russian-speaking ransomware syndicate took down the biggest US health care payment processor, pharmacies, health care providers, and patients were still scrambling to fill prescriptions for medicines, many of which are lifesaving.</p>
<p>On Thursday, UnitedHealth Group accused a notorious ransomware gang known both as AlphV and Black Cat of hacking its subsidiary Optum. Optum provides a nationwide network called Change Healthcare, which allows health care providers to manage customer payments and insurance claims. With no easy way for pharmacies to calculate what costs were covered by insurance companies, many had to turn to alternative services or offline methods.</p>
<h2>The most serious incident of its kind</h2>
<p>Optum first disclosed on February 21 that its services were down as a result of a “cyber security issue.” Its service has been hamstrung ever since. Shortly before this post went live on Ars, Optum said it had restored Change Healthcare services.</p>
<p>“Working with technology and business partners, we have successfully completed testing with vendors and multiple retail pharmacy partners for the impacted transaction types,” an <a href="https://status.changehealthcare.com/incidents/hqpjz25fn3n7">update</a> said. “As a result, we have enabled this service for all customers effective 1 pm CT, Friday, March 1, 2024.”</p>
<p>AlphV is one of many syndicates that operates under a ransomware-as-a-service model, meaning affiliates do the actual hacking of victims and then use the AlphV ransomware and infrastructure to encrypt files and negotiate a ransom. The parties then share the proceeds.</p>
<p>In December, the FBI and its equivalent in partner countries announced they had seized much of the AlphV infrastructure in a move that was intended to disrupt the group. AlphV promptly asserted it had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/12/alphv-ransomware-site-is-seized-by-the-fbi-then-its-unseized-and-so-on/">unseized its site</a>, leading to a tug-of-war between law enforcement and the group. The crippling of Change Healthcare is a clear sign that AlphV continues to pose a threat to critical parts of the US infrastructure.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>“The cyberattack against Change Healthcare that began on Feb. 21 is the most serious incident of its kind leveled against a US health care organization,” <a href="https://www.aha.org/news/perspective/2024-02-29-supporting-hospitals-and-patients-after-cyberattack-change-healthcare">said</a> Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association. Citing Change Healthcare data, Pollack said that the service processes 15 billion transactions involving eligibility verifications, pharmacy operations, and claims transmittals and payments. “All of these have been disrupted to varying degrees over the past several days and the full impact is still not known.”</p>
<p>Optum estimated that as of Monday, more than 90 percent of roughly 70,000 pharmacies in the US had changed how they processed electronic claims as a result of the outage. The company went on to say that only a small number of patients have been unable to get their prescriptions filled.</p>
<p>The scale and length of the Change Healthcare outage underscore the devastating effects ransomware has on critical infrastructure. Three years ago, members affiliated with a different ransomware group known as Darkside caused a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/colonial-pipeline-resumes-operations-after-ransomware-prompted-closure/">five-day outage of Colonial Pipeline</a>, which delivered roughly 45 percent of the East Coast's petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, and jet fuel. The interruption caused fuel shortages that sent airlines, consumers, and filling stations scrambling.
</p><p>Numerous ransomware groups have also taken down entire hospital networks in outages that in some cases have threatened patient care.</p>
<p>AlphV has been a key contributor to the ransomware menace. The FBI said in December the group had collected more than $300 million in ransoms. One of the better-known victims of AlphV ransomware was Caesars Entertainment and casinos owned by MGM, which brought operations in many Las Vegas casinos to a halt. A group of mostly teenagers is suspected of orchestrating that breach.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>"Algorithmic Thinking</em>&nbsp;provides the theoretical background and detailed problem explanations required to stay ahead of our human and robotic competitors."<br>
<strong>—Duncan Smith, Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft</strong></p>
<p>"Now a fully updated and expanded second edition, Daniel Zingaro's <em>Algorithmic Thinking: Unlock Your Programming Potential</em> from No Starch Press is an ideal, comprehensive, and thoroughly 'user friendly' instructional resource for C Programming Language students and software development professionals alike."<br>
<strong>—Midwest Book Review</strong></p>
<p>"In this newly revised edition, Daniel presents a carefully curated collection of challenging programming problems. By deconstructing the problems alongside clear, practical presentations of algorithms and data structures, <em>Algorithmic Thinking</em> will empower you–whether you're looking to get a leg up on technical interviews, enter the world of competitive programming, or just want to sharpen your skills."<br>
<strong>—Josh Lospinoso, Ph.D., author of <em>C++ Crash Course</em></strong></p>
<p>"As someone who learnt algorithms from similar problems-oriented books in the early 00s, I believe an updated yet beginner-friendly exposition is long overdue. This book provides implementation-friendly introductions to most building blocks of combinatorial algorithms . . . It's by far the quickest way to get hands-on experience with algorithms, and is also a great supplement to more theoretical expositions."<br>
<strong>—Richard Peng, Associate Professor at the University of Waterloo’s Cheriton School of Computer Science</strong></p>
<p>"Not only does <em>Algorithmic Thinking</em> guide readers on how to approach tackling problems, but Zingaro also helps them understand why these approaches work. With an engaging selection of problems drawn from programming competitions, the book is an excellent guide and an engaging companion for the readers on their learning journey."<br>
—<strong>Sushant Sachdeva, Ph.D., Algorithms Professor at the University of Toronto</strong></p>
<p>"The step-by-step solution explanations are so detailed that it feels like Daniel is directly teaching us, his readers. This Second Edition is a worthy update to an already excellent text. I particularly like the new chapter on the rarely discussed randomized algorithms. I believe Computer Science students will enjoy reading it as I do."<br>
<strong>—Dr Steven Halim, Senior Lecturer at National University of Singapore</strong></p>
<p>"The book discusses many interesting problems from programming contests and presents useful techniques that are not often included in algorithm textbooks."<br>
<strong>—Antti Laaksonen, University of Helsinki</strong></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>Reviews for the 1st edition:</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“With Zingaro as a tutor by your side, you'll learn, through practice on challenging competition problems, a repeatable process for figuring out and deftly applying the most appropriate algorithmic tools for the job. You'll learn it all from a book that exudes clarity, humor, and just the right dose of Canadian pride. Happy problem-solving!”</span></span></span><br>
<span><span><span>—</span></span></span><span><span><span><strong>Dr. Tim Roughgarden, Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>"A clear and engaging text . . . By presenting problems first and their algorithm/data structure solutions later, it shows us exactly why those solutions are useful and how they fit into the big picture. . . . Far too many textbooks present solutions fully-formed with no mention of the dead ends and too-complicated solutions you’d hit along the way. But </span></span></span><span><span><span><em>Algorithmic Thinking</em></span></span></span><span><span><span> takes you from the initial idea to the final breakthrough, setbacks and all.

A few months ago I introduced you to one of the more notable Apple pre-production units in my collection, <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/06/new-ram-card-prototype-mac-portable.html">a late prototype Macintosh Portable</a>. But it turns out it's not merely notable for what it is than what it has on it: a beta version of System 6.0.6 (the doomed release that Apple pulled due to bugs), Apple sales databases, two online services — the maligned Mac <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_%28online_service%29">Prodigy</a> client, along with classic AppleLink as used by Apple staff — and two presentations, one on Apple's current Macintosh line and one on the upcoming System 7. Now that I've got the infamous Conner hard drive it came with safely copied over, it's time to explore its contents some more.

We'll start with this Macintosh Portable itself and Apple's sales channel applications, moving from there to a brief presentation of Apple's Macintosh product line as Apple's own marketing staff would have presented it, at a distinct point in the company's history.

After that, we'll also look at the upcoming System 7.0 circa 1989-90 and a couple very different views of the operating system during its alpha phase.

Finally, after a brief glance at Mac Prodigy, we'll explore a little taste of AppleLink in its classic incarnation on General Electric's Mark III network — and spoof it enough to actually get it to log in.

This unit lacks U.S. Federal Communications Commission clearance, complete with a warning applique that says "ATTENTION! This unit is a demonstration unit only. It is not for sale or resale. Production units will comply with all applicable Federal Rules and Regulations." That last sentence would imply it isn't a production unit, meaning it's not at PVT stage, but it is clearly more developed than an EVT prototype would be. Since FCC certification usually occurs after hardware development is complete but before mass production begins, this makes it most likely a DVT unit. The only thing that doesn't work properly on this machine is the audio, which even after capacitor replacement remained unusually quiet, though I don't recall that it ever worked during its time in my possession.
</p><p>
I know of a couple other Macintosh Portable prototypes out there in collector's hands, though if you've got a Mac Portable yourself of any age, they all hail from that unpleasant turn-of-the-decade era where virtually all period Apple hardware will require new capacitors (everything in this one has been completely replaced). The Portable was not officially released until September 1989 simultaneously with the Macintosh IIci, where the base 1MB/floppy configuration started at $5799, or $6499 with one of those loathsome Conner hard disks (approximately $14,400 and $16,150 respectively in 2024 dollars). That puts this serial-less unit's manufacture likely somewhere around spring '89.
</p><p>
In architectural terms Apple described the Portable as an evolved Macintosh SE. Though high performance and with some innovative features, the Portable's biggest drawbacks — literally — were its size and its heavy lead-acid battery, and it sold barely a fifth of what it was expected to. Apple cancelled it in October 1991.

Naturally, being a pre-production prototype it's also not a backlit model — that of course came later — but the 640x400 screen remains excellent, an early example of an active matrix LCD that Apple boasted had an individual transistor for every pixel and one of the best displays on any portable machine from the period. (Sometime in the near future I'll dig out my Data General One, a fine example of the <em>opposite</em> extreme.) It has an Androda 7MB expansion card <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/06/new-ram-card-prototype-mac-portable.html">to give it 8MB of RAM</a>, just shy of the 9MB maximum it was capable of addressing, though no card sold for the Portable back in the day could achieve this and even the 9MB RAM cap is problematic. This is possibly due to the lowest motherboard 1MB being shared between ROM and RAM (ROM overlays it at reset to allow the machine to start even with RAM in a non-deterministic state), as well as at least one ROM bug that makes heavily expanded units sluggish when exiting sleep. On the Portable, which is all about being able to sleep on demand, the phenomenon becomes most obnoxious with "large" amounts of RAM like this.

We'll switch at this point to screengrabs instead of photos. Neither are ideal for our purposes, but although the Portable does have an external video-out port, that port don't hunt. Despite being a DE-15 VGA-style connector instead of the expected classic Mac DA-15, you'll actually damage it plugging in a VGA display; the lines it exposes are more or less the same as the LCD drive lines and require conversion. No presentation module came with this unit and despite Apple's promises and various rumours, there is no clear evidence any such adapter was ever produced for sale by anyone. We can't get every snapshot since the old Shift-Command-3 salute only runs when apps yield to the system, but it's better than trying to hover over the screen with my Pixel 7 Pro. (System 6 takes screenshots in MacPaint 576x720 format, which I have obviously reformatted and rotated.)

The specific version of classic Mac OS this machine is running is also unusual: it's a beta 12 release of System 6.0.6 (with a beta 6.1.6 Finder), which came out simultaneously with 6.0.5 in March 1990 for early Macintosh Classic, IIsi and LC machines, but was pulled from release and replaced with 6.0.7 in September. The problems were discovered so late in production that it even forced Apple to yank and reissue the system disk packs shipped with the computers, slapping "6.0.7" stickers on the label.
</p><p>
6.0.6 had two major problems, one where AppleTalk was sometimes not detected when present due to a bug in <tt>Gestalt</tt>, causing connectivity issues with servers and printers, and another with timing problems between the LC and IIsi and the ADB Apple Keyboard II, where the keyboard would intermittently freeze up until the mouse was moved. However, neither of those problems have manifested on this Portable so far, and 6.0.6 additionally fixed issues with the Portable's modem and reading 800K floppy disks, so you really should run at least 6.0.7 or 6.0.8 (it originally shipped with 6.0.4, also the same as the IIci).

The machine was clearly used for both business and pleasure, at least through 1991 which was the latest file I could cursorily find. A fair bit is personal and not generally interesting (and as such I've redacted or put off-screen a few things in these grabs), but it's proof it clearly got substantial use, and why not? Slung on a desk, it was a perfectly cromulent Macintosh with a 16MHz 68000, double that of the Plus, with a big sharp screen, a high quality keyboard and a nice trackball. You definitely wouldn't be using it on your lap, but you could certainly lug it to and from work.
</p><p>
That said, I'm not exactly certain where "work" in fact was located. Interestingly, one application on the hard disk suggests <em>Cleveland, Ohio</em>, of all places,

... but this might just be who held the site license, and when we get to AppleLink there's good evidence that the unit spent most of its time in Silicon Valley. I know the prior user was an Apple district manager from other credentials on the disk and a little bit of Googling. For obvious reasons I won't show those.

A related point is its network configuration: the Macintosh network volume mounted in these shots is my little NetBSD Macintosh IIci (for moving the grabs off), but it doesn't seem like it was ever connected to a network before because the username was originally blank in the Chooser. After all, it would be odd that other personal stuff and credentials weren't removed while the AppleTalk username specifically had been, so more likely it was never populated in the first place.
</p><p>
Other relics persist on the hard disk. For example, the HyperCard stacks introducing users to the Macintosh Portable are also still here, though they seem to be slightly earlier versions than what got shipped with production models and have different wording, and the Tour of the Macintosh Portable app isn't present. This unit may have predated it.

I picked two grabs out of it for example's sake, including the active matrix display (again, as you saw, it's really good especially for 1989) and its CMOS 68HC000 CPU, which was designed by Hitachi and introduced jointly with Motorola in 1985. Besides reducing power consumption from 1.35W down to about 300mW, it ran at 16MHz in the Portable compared to its usual Mac speed of around 8MHz (and the part could run as high as 20MHz). Despite the Portable's substantial development delays it was nevertheless one of the earliest computers to use it, along with the original PowerBook 100 which in nearly every respect is a miniaturized Portable.

There were a lot of products advertised. Spoiler alert: the Portable's underwhelming market performance mostly sealed their fates.

For example, this (and a similar image in the <i>Inside</i> stack) are the only pictures I could find of the video adapter. I don't know if this is a mockup or a prototype. There are a couple switches along with a Mac DA-15 monitor jack and an RCA jack, presumably for composite output. This device doesn't seem related at all to the separate and duly sold Apple Presentation System which was made by Focus and rebadged by Apple.

One other gotcha with the Portable, besides the weight, the huge lead acid battery wired in series and (nowadays) the capacitor issue, was its prodigious need for sleep. If you check the box to <i>Stay awake when plugged in</i> ...

... a verbose dialogue box warns you not to leave it on for more than 24 hours at a stretch or the display will start to act strangely, not unlike teenagers and college students. Fortunately, as with them, this effect appears to have been temporary.

That said, it's the work stuff that we're here for. This machine unsurprisingly has a full complement of office applications, including Aldus PageMaker and Aldus Persuasion (pre-Adobe), MacWrite II, MacDraw, HyperCard, and early versions of Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Works.

But what also caught my eye going through the applications folder was a suite named POS•IM. The name alone implies this is a point-of-sale system, divided into applications for accounts receivable, inventory and sales. I won't show any real customer records here and I don't know how widely deployed this was within the Apple sales channel at that time, but it probably wouldn't have been installed at all if there weren't some expectation it would be used.

The apps were produced by a Utah company called AnaMatrix. I can't find much information on this company and the suite appears to have been its only product. In <i>MacUser</i> February 1990, it listed for $2500 single-user and $4000 multiuser (in 2024 about $5800 and $9300 respectively), though it was called "POS/IM" with a slash instead of the interpunct. This installation is the single-user standalone release, starting here with the accounts receivable application.

We'll use this record "Bill Jones" since it's almost certainly an example (for one thing, that street address doesn't exist in the real Riverton, UT, and the zip code 87444 isn't currently valid). Each record tied back to an invoice.

The inventory application tracked nearly every single SKU Apple manufactured or sold at that time, even T-shirts and pens, though I think at least one of these is phony.

This is what I suspect is the phony entry, for an XL Apple T-shirt in blue, made by "Ned the Knitter" and sold for $17.95. The reason I suspect this is a demo row is because this exact item appears in AnaMatrix's few promotional screenshots of the time, like this one in that same issue of <i>MacUser</i>:

Or get out your wallet and spring for the big one. The most expensive unit I could find in the Apple price list was this Macintosh II with a 40MB hard disk for $5498 (M7003/A); in 2024 that would be nearly $15,000. This also suggests the price list here wasn't particularly current since it didn't include the IIx (September 1998), but it does have the SE (March 1987, with the II), dating it likely to the same year.

The actual invoices themselves were in the third application, Sales•Point. Parenthetically, a separate menu option for "Transfer" allowed you to jump between the three apps in the suite if you didn't have enough memory to run them simultaneously in MultiFinder, or didn't use MultiFinder at all (which would give you all the machine's available RAM minus the operating system, as these about boxes show).

Here's that invoice "Bill Jones" bought: an ImageWriter II (A9M0320, $595) and a Macintosh SE with an Extended Keyboard (M5085/A, $2998); the other SE SKU would be for the smaller Apple Keyboard.

You could also run a sales report, but only two came up, "Bill Jones"' big cash splash included (I'm not sure if there were archives maintained off-machine).

That covers billing, inventory and sales, so how about advertising? For this next part we're going to spend some time with its copy of Aldus Persuasion 1.0. Interestingly, PowerPoint beat Persuasion to the Macintosh by about a year (1987 vs 1988), but Persuasion was for a time considered the superior product due to its interface, graphing capabilities and popular outline mode.

Two Aldus Persuasion 1.0 presentations stand out in particular (this is the copy which I've mounted on my Mystic Colour Classic for reasons I'll relate in a moment), both of which were official Apple marketing material at the time. The first is Apple's then-current product line, and the second is an early glimpse at the upcoming System 7. Neither file was apparently Apple-internal or confidential and both seem to have been regularly presented to potential customers and users.

The Macintosh Product Overview slides have a collective creation and modification date of October 8, 1989, consistent with the 1989 copyright the presentation displays. However, its actual origination can be no <em>later</em> than March 1989 due to the models that it completely lacks.

No unreleased or upcoming computers are demonstrated or referenced in this presentation, dividing the existing models simply into two small "Compact" and "Modular" families. This appears to have been the manifestation of Macintosh manager Jean-Louis Gassée's "high-right" goal which tried to sell high-margin, high-performance machines at the expense of the "low-left" budget market. Unfortunately for Apple, the strategy permitted cheaper XT-class PCs to proliferate in Apple's relative absence while failing to compete effectively with Unix workstations at the top. In December 1989 Apple's stock tanked 20 percent after a dismal holiday sales season and Gassée departed a month later, but this presentation doesn't reflect the subsequent product shakeup that birthed the deliberately low-end Mac Classic and LC.

The long-running Macintosh Plus was still in Apple's sales list but got one measly slide, strongly suggesting it was on its way out. The 2MB and 4MB versions were also completely absent from the presentation so as not to compete with the SE. Instead, the presenter talked up the SE and especially the SE/30, putting them head to head and otherwise ignoring the Plus completely. "Memory Management" refers to the Motorola 68851 MMU, available as an option for the 68020 (but not the 68000), which was built-in to the SE/30's 68030 and also slightly faster. The SE/30 came out in January 1989, so the presentation can't be any older than that.

The Modular family, however, only lists two members: the II and the IIx. This is where the maximum <em>late</em> date of March 1989 comes in, being when the IIcx was first introduced, the first three-slot II and the next one in the series. Since it doesn't appear here, the presentation can't be any (or at least much) later than the IIcx's formal introduction.

Still, the SE/30 and the IIx were indisputably the stars of this show, and the most obvious members of the "high-right" family at that time (early 1989). Other than the slots and form factor, the two systems were very similar, with the same CPU (with FPU and MMU), same clock speed and same RAM ceiling.

The Macintosh Product Overview slideshow was entirely 1-bit black and white, so I rendered it out to PICTs from the Portable itself for the most authentic result. However, the System 7 presentation has colour elements and the Portable doesn't support Color QuickDraw. For this section we'll go back to the Color Classic to render this slide deck, which I've tweaked slightly due to minor differences in font rendering. (I'm not sure how this particular presentation would have even displayed properly on the Portable.)

This presentation has a modification and creation date of February 3, 1991. Recall that around March 1988 Apple technical staff made the first cut of what was planned for System 7 as Blue, with the remainder becoming Pink (and later Taligent) and Red. This particular presentation is oriented around Blue's modest goals ("System 6, corrected," as Wikipedia puts it) and doesn't even mention Pink. However, the presentation shows a few more primitive or speculative features than what emerged with System 7.0 in May 1991, one technology in particular (we'll discuss) can't have appeared under that name any later than May 1990, and several 1990 models don't appear in the support matrix, putting an upper bound of around March 1990 on when the deck could have been made or updated. The presentation itself carries a 1989 copyright on the final slide.

Assuming this wasn't just a mockup screenshot, the Finder and general user interface had a number of noticeable differences from the released version of 7.0. The menu bar has slightly different options in slightly different order; this earlier version used Color instead of Label, and the Special menu came before it. System 7's help icon was also part of the "menu mass" like Mac OS 8, just with a help diamond, instead of being an icon off to the side as with Balloon Help.
</p><p>
Individual Finder windows also appeared differently: the window title bar is fatter and the detail row is slightly skewed down, not vertically centred. There are also different icons, including a schematic of the desktop for the Finder instead of the stylised compact Mac icon used in System 6 and (with revisions) 7.0, and the Startup Items folder is just called the Startup Folder with what looks like a placeholder graphic. As with the final release, the System file remains a suitcase.

System 7 was additionally the début of TrueType, Apple's outline font technology and still the dominant font format on most PCs and Macs (especially given that OpenType is more or less a superset), but the actual <em>name</em> TrueType appears nowhere in this presentation, nor do its known codenames Royal and Bass. That doesn't mean Apple wasn't proud of it. Indeed, it was such a big advance over font handling in System 6 that TrueType was subsequently backported to it, and Apple granted a license to Microsoft for free to ensure TrueType's success. Ironically this was one of the slides I had to tweak on the Color Classic because the font size of the blurb on the right came out too large.

System 7 also made MultiFinder mandatory. This screenshot cannot be contemporary with the Finder screenshot above because the small icon for the Finder is still System 6's; that makes this screenshot almost certainly older, which also explains why the MultiFinder application list is still in the Apple menu. On the other hand, no desk accessories are shown in the Apple menu either like one would expect with System 6 MultiFinder, so this is probably truly an early System 7 build assuming it's also not a mockup shot.

Newly introduced was a varied class of technologies related to message passing between applications, which is foundational for higher-level features like scripting and embedding. Apple subsumed these various features under the umbrella of the Inter-Application Communications Architecture, or the IAC. These messages could be passed between applications on the local machine or over a network, using AppleTalk as the transport. Today we call those messages Apple events, and the fundamental technology remains part of modern macOS today.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgx2UOfgiNue2s7TbZe180cz5M_awtBW_3otVuOxKMfStxPkI3lmQ9r1kWu1sA4vdiL-_ohkdRaQ8FKd8oKY42FsW0CphY-hI2oaynhyphenhyphenwI1AfpWVLzpqNAV5ewETsAcleE_v5O678yvlBtkfSlk26ijHpuiOD470MB0aS98-NgUmG0jy2EoyEf5gK4_scc/s640/014.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="480" data-original-width="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgx2UOfgiNue2s7TbZe180cz5M_awtBW_3otVuOxKMfStxPkI3lmQ9r1kWu1sA4vdiL-_ohkdRaQ8FKd8oKY42FsW0CphY-hI2oaynhyphenhyphenwI1AfpWVLzpqNAV5ewETsAcleE_v5O678yvlBtkfSlk26ijHpuiOD470MB0aS98-NgUmG0jy2EoyEf5gK4_scc/s320/014.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

However, one of the IAC features that <em>didn't</em> succeed was the Editions Manager, later redacted to the Edition Manager and surfaced to the user as "Publish and Subscribe." In this scheme an application could "publish" part or all of a file that another application could "subscribe" to (more precisely, a document could have sections in it called "publishers" connected to "subscriber" sections in other documents). If this sounds like Microsoft's Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), it's deliberate, as Publish and Subscribe was supposed to be the OLE killer with non-rectangular regions and update notifications that could even go over a network — because the notifications were just Apple events. This has nothing to do <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/10/teaching-apple-cyberdog-10-new-tricks.html">with OpenDoc</a>, by the way, which was Apple's second failed attempt at an OLE-like technology and uses a completely different internal architecture.
</p><p>
The Edition Manager ended up being complicated for developers and obnoxious for users. Since publication occurred at the section level, compliant applications had to define what sections existed in a document, and for those sections that were published write their contents (termed <i>editions</i>) to an escrow-like repository called an <i>edition container</i>. On the user end, this felt like doing a special "cut and paste" from a source into a client document to create a new section and link it. When the Edition Manager saw updates happen, it would fire off Apple events to signal subscribers to read that data from the edition container into their own sections; conversely, when the Edition Manager saw a subscriber try to read or scroll a section, it would fire off other Apple events to <em>publishers</em> to remind them to update.

None of this work was automatically done by the individual applications, though, so it wasn't unusual for publishers to fail to update their editions or subscribers to fail to retrieve them, or sometimes for the link to just break completely. I personally remember screaming at CricketGraph in 1996 trying to get charts in my undergraduate cognitive science paper within Microsoft Word to actually show anything, but to this day I still have no idea whose fault that was (except that it wasn't mine, dammit). Since the feature was rickety even in those applications that tried to support it and the level of developer headache was high, it ended up little used, and when OpenDoc eclipsed P&amp;S and then fizzled itself, the Edition Manager was "edited out" (heh heh) of Rhapsody and never implemented for Carbon.

But the part of the IAC that allowed applications to send events to other applications and manipulate them became a lasting feature. This is the basic functionality that AppleScript still uses, which is pretty much all about sending events to apps, and was the basis for the Program-to-Program Communications Toolbox (PPC Toolbox, unrelated to PowerPC, which didn't exist at this point) that underlaid program linking in System 7 as well. Program linking, in this case, specifically refers to allowing programs on remote Macs to send events to programs on yours. This was how you could remotely manipulate server programs running on other Macs, and was <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/11/the-apple-network-servers-all-too.html">ported to AIX for the Apple Network Server so that "symbiotic applications"</a> could use the ANS for backend processing: the ANS looked like just another remote Mac you could send events to via AppleTalk, which the application on the local Mac could task with jobs and then asynchronously display their results. In Mac OS 9 TCP/IP became a supported transport for network Apple events and this capability <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/allow-remote-application-scripting-mchlp1398/mac">remains part of modern macOS</a> as well.

On the other hand, for sheer obscurity you couldn't beat CL/1. CL/1 was short for "Connection Language One" and originally developed by Network Innovations (unrelated to the current business bearing the name), a small company founded in 1984 and also based in Cupertino. Based around SQL but adding control structures for cursors, program logic and looping, CL/1 was intended for writing desktop-to-host applications to query remote databases on mainframes and large systems, transforming CL/1 programs into various SQL subqueries which were collected and returned. Unlike the later ODBC, most of this processing happened on the server, reducing network bandwidth but increasing server load and requiring an "adapter" program specific to the database engine in use. However, this also meant that client applications could be straightforward, simply shipping CL/1 programs to the remote server for execution and not requiring local processing other than the data that came back.
</p><p>
As both a practical demonstration and a sellable product, the company's first CL/1-based package, appropriately called Mac-to-VAX, allowed Mac applications to remotely access databases, files and applications on a DEC VAX server. Released in January 1988, CL/1 could use AppleTalk, DECnet, X.25, IBM 3270 and Apple’s implementation of IBM APPC/LU6.2 as transports. Apple was immediately attracted to the technology, seeing it as both advantageous for the Mac and as a possible standard they could control, and acquired the company in March as a subsidiary (its first acquisition of another technology company, as it happens). <!-- https://techmonitor.ai/technology/apple_extends_mac_to_host_focus_with_network_innovations_buy -->

The name CL/1 didn't last very long after the merger and the last reference I can find to it in industry sources is around May 1990 when its new name, Data Access Language (DAL), started appearing. Apple also scotched Network Innovations' originally planned ports to PC in 1990, determining to make DAL at least initially an Apple-exclusive technology. That said, while this slide implies Apple intended to include some portion of DAL-née-CL/1 with System 7, only the Data Access Manager (DAM) API became a built-in part of the operating system; the extension(s) implementing DAL proper for a given platform seem to have been a separate install and aren't on any of my System 7 disk sets. This is important to distinguish because the DAM just moves prefabricated DAL queries and replies back and forth and doesn't implement DAL itself.

Post-System 7, DAL suffered from the intermittent attention span 1990s Apple exhibited with many of its projects. Its most impressive application was as an extension for HyperCard, where it facilitated some remarkable live demos and some of the earliest data-driven fat clients with full GUIs, causing a scramble by database vendors — notably Oracle — to implement their own toolkits. (This toolkit started as Format Verlag's Plus, became Oracle Card after Oracle's acquisition, and later became Oracle Media Objects, best known for the Mac version that ran on <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/07/apples-interactive-television-box.html">the Apple Interactive Television Box prototype</a>.) While the client side remained Apple-specific, the server side became impressively cross-platform, growing to support IBM (VM/CMS, MVS/TSO, MVS/VTAM, DOS/VSE), DEC (VMS, Ultrix), SVR4, DG/UX, HP-UX, AIX, SunOS, Stratus AOS/VS II and Tandem Guardian C-30, running databases such as SQL/DS, IBM DB2, Teradata DBC/1012, CA-Datacom, CA-IDMS, Ingres, Informix (the database I had my first job out of college on), Oracle, Sybase, DEC Rdb, CA-DB, INFOS II, DG/SQL and Tandem NonStop/SQL. Apple also expanded the network transport options to include TCP/IP with the growing reach of the Internet.
</p><p>
Unfortunately for Apple, development for all these server permutations was expensive, reflected in very high prices for the adapter component, and the adapters also tended to incur performance problems largely from the overhead of translating and running DAL queries which were difficult to cache. While the concept of shared <i>query documents</i> in the Data Access Manager was at least in part intended to reduce this impact, few client applications ended up having much DAL code in common. Although EveryWare's ButlerSQL tried to rectify the translation issue by using DAL as its <em>native</em> language, the most notable of the few that attempted to do so, it ran on the classic Mac OS and its performance was instead limited by Mac OS's poor multitasking and throughput. (Apple was <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/11/the-apple-network-servers-all-too.html">well aware of this problem</a>.) Developers also complained about DAL's lack of BLOB and cross-platform support, neither of which Apple did much to address. Apple did license DAL to Blyth Software to develop a Windows client but it got little traction or interest.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, ODBC grew dominant both due to DAL's technical stagnation and ODBC's greater throughput, especially as network bandwidth was dramatically increasing. Apple licensed DAL to Independence Technologies (ITI) in February 1994, who intended to release DAL 2.0 supporting blobs and to take over Windows development, while Apple maintained control of DAM in Mac OS. ITI got bought itself in 1995 by BEA Systems and sold again to UniPrise in 1996, but the promised update never emerged before UniPrise went out of business in 1998. The Data Access Manager, like the Edition Manager, faded from disuse and was never ported to Rhapsody or Carbon, and ODBC became the primary database access method even in the classic Mac OS. However, the TCP port used by DAL — port 172 — remains as <tt>cl/1</tt> in <tt>/etc/services</tt> to this day.

The other piece enabling us to more precisely date this presentation is its model support list: the latest models shown are the Macintosh IIci and the Portable itself, which both came out in September 1989. The next model in the chronology would have been the IIfx in March 1990, which doesn't appear here, so the presentation can't be later than that. Notice that the original Macintosh 128K, 512K and 512Ke are listed as "supported" — but only if you effectively make them into Macintosh Pluses first.

All this was an "alpha" view of the operating system. The mention of developer seeding is prominent and intentional; Apple remembered the incompatibilities that resulted from failing to widely disseminate System 6 to developers and was determined not to make the same mistake. This slide anticipated customer availability in "Summer 1990" but System 7.0 was not released until May 1991.
</p><p>
So let's say we're out in the field with these presentations, doing our thing, selling our wares, hyping our master. How did we call back to the mothership?

One of the online services on this Portable was the Macintosh client for <a href="http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/932">Prodigy</a>, the famous graphical service that used modified NAPLPS graphics as its user interface. However, I didn't find any screens in its cache, suggesting it got hardly any use. Additionally, while Prodigy used Tymnet's X.25 dial-in network for its nationwide access, neither of these numbers appears in <a href="https://github.com/TYMNET/docs/blob/master/tymnet.txt">the 1990 Tymnet dial-in number list</a>. The main telephone number lacks an area code, though area code 614 was one of Ohio's original four area codes in the North American Numbering Plan encompassing Columbus and most of the state's southeast quadrant (Cleveland, for the record, was area code 216). 614 didn't split until 1998 when most of it became new area code 740.
</p><p>
These screenshots were done on the Mystic Color Classic in anticipation of being able to render out some of its <tt>STAGE.DAT</tt> contents, but there appears to be much less interest and support in the Prodigy retro-community for the Mac client, and I wasn't able to get anything recognizeable out of it. (The different endianness may be only one of many reasons why.) The low interest is somewhat understandable since the Mac client wasn't used much, and the Prodigy interface wasn't very Mac-like nor very popular with Macintosh users. Since it doesn't look like this person used it much either, we won't do anything further with it in this article.

But what our district manager did appear to use is AppleLink, and that's where we'll spend the remainder of our time.
</p><p>
AppleLink was a client-server service for Apple employees and dealers, and later developers, established in 1985 running over the General Electric Information Services (GEIS) nationwide Mark III network. (It is distinct from the later consumer-oriented but technically unrelated AppleLink Personal Edition, which later turned into America Online; we'll talk more about that and eWorld, AppleLink's intended successor, at the end.)

AppleLink's front-end was a fat GUI client to show remote resources as folders and files, and send and receive both public (i.e., bulletin-board) and private messages. This screenshot of a typical session in System 7 is from <i>Apple Confidential</i>.

The front end allows you to work offline, which is handy since of course there's no AppleLink server to connect to anymore, along with an extensive built-in help library to reference regardless of connection status. Unfortunately relatively few tasks could be completed without a network connection.

E-mail — at least within the network itself — became one of the most well-known features of AppleLink, including the first E-mail message sent from space. These are pictures of mission specialists James C. Adamson and Shannon Lucid with an original non-backlit Macintosh Portable on <a href="https://www.wikiarchives.space/index.php?/category/837">NASA Space Shuttle Mission STS-43</a>, <i>Atlantis</i>' ninth mission from August 2 to August 11, 1991. It had been lightly modified with a circuit breaker on the battery charging system for safety but was otherwise stock except for some bushings under the trackball to take up slack.
</p><p>
The Portable was ostensibly transported into space for the purposes of Development Test Objective (DTO) 1208, Space Station Cursor Control Device Evaluation II and Advanced Applications, which tested the in-flight ergonomics of the Portable's onboard trackball, a 2-inch external ADB trackball, an ADB optical mouse and a modified aircraft control stick with a thumb ball hat. While most of the Space Shuttle laptops were PCs such as ThinkPads (with the notable exception of the <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/01/solbournes-in-space.html">SPARC-based Solbourne PILOT</a>), the Portable was selected for this objective because it had a larger variety of commercially available input devices. The Portable was also used to record data from the Lower Body Negative Pressure experiment (LBNP, DSO 478), in which the astronauts evaluated use of the LBNP unit for drawing body fluids down to their legs to reverse counterflow under weightlessness, as well as shuttle flight path tracking using a custom application called MacSPoC ("SPoC" being short for "Shuttle Portable Computer") and acting as an alarm clock and scheduler. This latter function was assisted by a <a href="https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/huh-a-seiko-apple-smart-watch-is-set-to-hit-the-auction-block">Seiko WristMac</a> "databank" watch which downloaded reminders from the Portable to its 2K memory.
</p><p>
It's not clear whose idea the "space E-mail" was, but it was publicized by Apple as early <a href="https://tidbits.com/1991/07/29/applelink-in-space/">as July 1991</a> as a means for astronauts to communicate with family and exchange files and data. The Earthbound side was GEIS's regular packet-switched network (more about that in a moment) fed into a ROLM telephone switch, terminating in a data linkup to a ground-based Mac Portable via the printer port at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Apple wrote a "forwarder" which took those packets and sent them back out through the modem port to an actual modem whose signal was then digitized, bounced off a commercial satellite to the White Sands (New Mexico) Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, and finally sent to a TDRSS satellite geosynchronous with Shuttle Atlantis. On the Shuttle side, the spacecraft received the signal as digital data and fed it as an analogue signal into an onboard modem connected to the Mac Portable. The same convoluted process in reverse handled injecting packets from the spacebound Mac Portable back into the GEIS network. From the point of view of the Mark III, this was just another packet-switched remote node, albeit one with an incredible amount of latency. Latency wasn't something that the stock AppleLink <em>client</em> handled well, however, so a modified version of AppleLink 6.0.2 went up with the Portable that had been tweaked to tolerate transmission delays.
</p><p>
The connection took several tries but Adamson and Lucid were able to successfully sent the first E-mail from space on August 9, to shuttle communicator Marcia Ivins at the JSC. The exact message contents <a href="https://tidbits.com/1991/08/19/mac-in-space-ii/">vary</a> between <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140216055859/https://support.apple.com/kb/TA30635">sources</a>, but in general the message read, in its entirety,
</p><p>
Hello Earth ! Greetings from the STS-43 Crew. This is the first AppleLink from space. Having a __GREAT__ time, wish you were here,... send cry[o], and [R]CS! Have a nice day...... Haste la vista, baby,... we'll be back!
</p>
<p>
where "cry" or "cryo" refers to cryogenics (in this case, liquid oxygen for breathing), and "CS" or "RCS" refers to the Reaction Control System, i.e., fuel for thruster manoeuvres. The shuttle was able to receive E-mail as well but this address was kept secret from the public (and various obvious honeypots also set up) to prevent the astronauts from being deluged. 
</p><p>
That brings us to attempting to log in ourselves, and for that we should talk briefly about the backend this time. GEIS' roots extend to the 1962 Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS), a proposal by Dartmouth College professors John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz to develop a free, open timesharing system for students. Kemeny and Kurtz established a partnership with General Electric in 1963 and got funding from the National Science Foundation to deploy a 1961 GE-225 mainframe for processing, a 20-bit system with a typical eight kilowords of core memory, paired with an 18-bit GE DATANET-30 ("DN-30") connected via DMA functioning as a terminal server. The DN-30 was itself a full general purpose computer but in this application it was fully dedicated to the task of scheduling jobs on the mainframe and servicing terminals, of which it could support up to 128. This double-system concept was considered unusual and even wasteful for the time, but by the autumn of 1964 the system was operating twenty terminals serving hundreds of users and upgraded seamlessly to a larger GE-235 with triple the memory speed. This first incarnation of DTSS was the system Kemeny and Kurtz developed BASIC on in 1963.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj15rYjjnkrnKOuRLCHYQGL5_EK47TnhBHaX4_CDltGeCqxd_E2hfU_MkmVmtHMuTnzI1Dke818N1zxTixecQkdjsmebee1kUALEWMuRZlC-YLwN1ZibUnZYagR0adZHOPdRvJzZfEYdbkvIGOpHkvGFgZY1N4uONgdhBZfrbYNrI8XMgl_PF-cMajP8ZE/s2906/ge645.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="1524" data-original-width="2906" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj15rYjjnkrnKOuRLCHYQGL5_EK47TnhBHaX4_CDltGeCqxd_E2hfU_MkmVmtHMuTnzI1Dke818N1zxTixecQkdjsmebee1kUALEWMuRZlC-YLwN1ZibUnZYagR0adZHOPdRvJzZfEYdbkvIGOpHkvGFgZY1N4uONgdhBZfrbYNrI8XMgl_PF-cMajP8ZE/s320/ge645.jpg" width="320"></a></p><p>

Kemeny and Kurtz had initially wanted GE to enter into a research arrangement, but GE declined their proposal, and the original partnership was structed purely as a commercial sale. However, as DTSS grew successful GE became impressed with the flexibility of the architecture and decided to take a more active role in its development. Explicitly combining the GE-235 and DN-30 as the GE-265, GE started advertising timesharing services on their own systems in 1965 and building out a national network to allow access over dedicated lines. 
</p><p>
At the same time GE had developed a new 36-bit mainframe architecture supporting up to four CPUs and as much as 4MW of memory as a way to reduce their own dependence on IBM. The GE 600 series started with the GE-635 in 1963 (the above picture is a GE-645, a larger version with hardware support for Multics and virtual memory) which ran GE's GECOS "GE Comprehensive Operating Supervisor" batch processing system. By 1967 DTSS had been ported to the GE-635/DN-30 and GE adopted it as their "Mark II" network, retroactively dubbing their original GE-265 implementation as "Mark I." By 1968 GE controlled somewhere between a third and forty percent of the timesharing market, serving tens of thousands of users, and the timesharing unit became its own division in 1969.
</p><p>
In 1970 GE decided to exit the computing hardware business and offloaded the GE 600 series to Honeywell, who renamed it the Honeywell 6000 family. The Honeywell 6000s still used the same basic architecture and still ran GECOS, merely renaming it to GCOS ("<em>General</em> Comprehensive Operating <em>System</em>"), and GE started using their hardware instead. However, GE retained their profitable timesharing service, now transitioning to Honeywell hardware, developing a means for Mark II systems to submit batch jobs to GCOS in a seamless and nearly interactive fashion. This became the Mark III network in 1972.
</p><p>
GE's dominance of commercial timesharing grew even stronger in the 1970s with its high availability, facilitated by specialized clustering hardware allowing users to be spread over up to six mainframes and have the same view of the Mark II machines' filesystem, and three redundant international data centers equally accessible from anywhere in the world. GE also evolved their remote access operations into a packet-switched, telephone-accessible extended X.25 international network that was included with their services. In 1979 GE spun off their services division into the joint venture GEISCO (GE Information Services Company) with Honeywell but bought back Honeywell's portion in 1982, later renaming it to General Electric Information Services (GEIS). By the mid-1980s the Mark III network had local access numbers in over 750 cities and 31 countries, handling as many as five thousand simultaneous users. GE eventually added other network types such as IBM SNA and by the 1990s had four worldwide networks running on the same backbone.

In 1984 the original Macintosh was a hit for Apple but came with new costs of its own as the expense of maintaining its traditional dealer network was skyrocketing. Interminable games of "telephone tag" had already been a problem during the Apple II days and Apple was spending half a million dollars a year — in 1984 dollars — just to print price lists. Apple management reasoned that while setting up an electronic dealer network would itself be pricey, it would enable them to contain many of their distribution expenses, facilitate better communication, and allow them to outsource their existing timesharing system used for staff E-mail. Head of support John Ebbs, formerly a senior executive at General Electric, suggested his former company could help develop a useful service that could also show off the Mac at the same time.
</p><p>
Apple approached GEISCO in 1984, making a key requirement to use the Macintosh's graphical interface instead of the text-based terminal access GEISCO currently afforded users. For this GE engineers developed a GCOS backend called EF3 ("Error-Free") which the Macintosh client would act as an asynchronous interface for, and Apple contracted with Central Coast Software to write the front end, who developed it in Pascal. To encourage dealer adoption Apple subsidized the network somewhat by giving them a free hour of connect time per month and $15 an hour (in 2024 about $43) thereafter, though this rate was higher outside the United States. Unlike <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2022/04/tonight-were-gonna-log-on-like-its-1979.html">services such as The Source</a>, Apple's service didn't run on leftover after-hours capacity and dealers were unlikely to connect when their shops were closed, so the rate didn't vary on the time of day. The first release and availability of the new AppleLink network was in fall 1985.

The AppleLink client version on this Macintosh Portable is 5.1. The original AppleLink 1.0 client for the first generation Macintosh was quickly upgraded for the Macintosh Plus in 1986 and I have one of these floppies with "Macintosh Plus Version" prominently stamped on it. Versions through at least 6.1 are known, with additional work done on the client by Bear River Associates, then in Berkeley and <a href="https://www.bearriver.com/about/">still in business</a> in Oakland. Later versions of the client upgrade to GE's later EFX "Error-Free eXtended" protocol which replaced EF3.
</p><p>
We know our Apple district manager used this because their credentials are in the dialogue box (which I've suppressed). I haven't suppressed the rest, though, because they're germane to understanding how the Mark III network operated. And where we can learn the most about it is from a much more famous online service that used it too: GEnie.

Separate from its work on AppleLink and related products we'll discuss at the end, GEIS had noted the rise of nascent consumer-oriented online services like <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2022/04/tonight-were-gonna-log-on-like-its-1979.html">The Source</a> (then owned by Reader's Digest in partnership with Control Data Corporation) and CompuServe (a subsidiary of H&amp;R Block), and decided they could compete in the same market — but with less overhead and presumably more profitably, because they already had their own nationwide local access network, their own hardware and their own data centres. The job was tasked to <a href="http://www.billlouden.com/bio.html">Bill Louden</a>, CompuServe's former director of communications and one of history's candidates for coining the term "email," who transplanted facsimiles of CompuServe's most popular features to the new platform along with new content while carefully concealing its GCOS underpinnings. Reportedly the name "GEnie" came from Louden's wife after a $50,000 consultant disastrously proposed calling it "Albert" (Einstein), to which they added the backronym "General Electric Network for Information Exchange."
</p><p>
The new GEnie service launched in October 1985 with both 300bps and 1200bps access. Criticially, although GEnie did have on-peak and off-peak rates at a startling differential (launching at $35/hr prime-time 8am-6pm on weekdays but $5/hr otherwise, or in 2024 dollars about $100/hr and $14/hr respectively), GEnie undercut CompuServe by not charging a premium for 1200 baud connections, offsetting any additional cost from higher speed users against its excess unused computing time. Eventually 2400bps access was added as well, also at the same "flat" rates.

A typical user would dial their local access number (8N1, local echo-half duplex preferred) and after successful connection send a series of </p><tt>H</tt><p> characters to get the network gateway's attention (contemporary sources said </p><tt>HHH</tt><p> and press RETURN, but really any sequence of at least two would be enough). The local gateway would then open an X.25 link to one of GE's datacentres, which responded with a famously terse login prompt. The initial dance looked a little like this (<b>bold</b> is what we type):
</p><div><pre><b>ATDT5551234</b>

CONNECT 1200
<b>HHH</b>

U#=
</pre></div>
<p>
Signons to the Mark III network were of the general form <tt>XXX#####</tt>, <tt>X</tt> being a letter and <tt>#</tt> a number. The signons for creating a GEnie account (credit card required) often literally started with <tt>X</tt>, such as <tt>XJM11878</tt> or <tt>XTX99437</tt> — these were real signons that were in use at various times. It was then followed by a comma and the password, which was frequently <tt>GENIE</tt> or some such for the signup logins. If the login was accepted, they would proceed to the main menu, which in 1986 looked like this (from the manual):
</p><div><pre>U#=<b>XXX12345,PASSWORD</b>

The menus provided a guided way to access GEnie services, but under the hood everything was organized into numerical pages using the ubiquitous <tt>MOVE</tt> (<tt>M</tt> for short) command. The main "top" menu was always on page 1. While less-opaque word mnemonics also existed for many services (printed at the top centre, so the top menu's mnemonic was <tt>TOP</tt>), if you knew the number for a particular area or application, you could jump straight to it. Many users used GEnie exclusively for games such as Kesmai's Air Warrior and Simutronics' GemStone, which offered massively multiplayer experiences decades before modern MMOs, and had scripts in their terminal programs or clients to check messages and then start their favourite game immediately. (Like GEnie's competitors, popular services like these often had surcharges, which could sometimes be sizeable.) GemStone III, for example, was 1335, E-mail was on 200, and the LiveWire "CB Simulator" chat system was on 400.
</p><p>
In fact, the login sequence itself could even facilitate doing so immediately upon signon, saving valuable connect time. If you logged in as, say, <tt>XTX12345,password,625;1</tt> — remember this format, it will be relevant later — which followed the login and password with another comma, the page number, a semicolon, and an item number, this would immediately move to page 625 (this was the Commodore 8-bit "Flagship" RoundTable, GEnie jargon for a bulletin board) and select option 1 from its menu (in this case showing you a list of categories). The Commodore 8-bit community was especially concentrated on GEnie during its final years after the shutdown of QuantumLink in 1993, featuring <a href="https://cbmfiles.com/genie/index.php">a large filebase</a> and roundtable roster, and login scripts like <a href="https://cbmfiles.com/genie/geniefiles/C128Telecom/GENIE-II">this one for DesTerm 128</a> relied precisely on this capability (warning: PETSCII). On the Apple side, a separate GEnie roundtable for Macintosh users existed outside of AppleLink on page 605. Fortunately for user-to-user communication services like these, most of the system used friendlier alias names for accounts and generally relegated the network login to authentication and billing.

With GEnie's operation as context, we should be able to see all the pieces in the setup dialogue necessary to start reverse-engineering the AppleLink signon process. The phone number has no area code, but 362-XXXX is one of the prefixes for nearby San Jose in Apple's home area code 408 (and since this user was dialing without an area code at the time, this system must have been local to the gateway). Although GEIS never published a comprehensive printed list of its access numbers that I could find, it's most likely that the machine on the other end was an Apple-provided gateway with a leased line into the GE network (though for the record Apple's telephone exchange in Cupertino generally looks like 408-996-XXXX). This Portable is fitted with an Apple internal 1200bps modem which was what this system was originally configured to call out through. However, you can also route the call via (using the Portable CDEV) the modem port or (this screen) the printer port to an external modem or other serial link.
</p><p>
As for the signon, we can see a Mark III login of the standard format in this window, here called the "System number." Knowing what we know about GEnie, that means the signon to access (at least this instance of) AppleLink was <tt>NJL37300</tt> and the password was <tt>Apple</tt> (note the comma between them), but this clearly couldn't be an individual user's identifier. The AppleLink ID <em>is</em> populated (I've only censored it), so it must transmit it somehow.
</p><p>
The way we find out is by looking at AppleLink's CCL scripts. CCL stands for Communications Control Language, a simple domain-specific scripting language that originated with the AppleLink client as a means of adding and adjusting connection methods without having to constantly update the main application. They work essentially by emitting strings, or, for control flow, branching on a matched string to a specified numeric label, along with a small set of register variables and special keywords to manipulate the serial port. CCL outlasted its original purpose: an updated form became the modem scripting language for Apple Remote Access, was updated again for Mac OS X through 10.4 Tiger to remove its dependency on string resources, and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/HardwareDrivers/Reference/CCLScriptingRef/CCLCommands/CCLCommands.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005464-CH4-SW1">was updated a final time in 10.5 Leopard</a> to support strings in property lists. While most people no longer use modems and Macs haven't included them in years, the infrastructure remains supported in modern macOS for things like external USB modems and serial ports, and you can still find your Mac's available CCLs in <tt>/Library/Modem Scripts</tt>.
</p><p>
It will be easiest for us to spoof AppleLink by pretending to be a regular Hayes-compatible modem, and AppleLink has a CCL for that called <tt>USAModem.CCL</tt>. Happily, these scripts are regular MacRoman and readable with a text editor. Here are some extracts.

The string "Signalling the modem" emitted by the keyword <tt>DsplyMsg</tt> is the current connection status, and is displayed within the connection dialogue box like so:

This segment then goes on to set the strings it intends to respond to. The </p><tt>MatchStr</tt><p> keyword takes three arguments, a string slot (only a fixed number of strings can be searched for at once), a label to branch to if the string is matched, and then the string itself. Matching occurs automatically as text is received and matches do not (indeed usually don't) need to match the entire received string. It next sends an AT command </p><tt>ATS0=0E0X4V1</tt><p> followed by a carriage return, which sets modem register 0 to 0 (never auto-answer), turns off echo, turns on busy signal and dial tone detection, and requests verbose English responses. If the pause of 180 tenths of a second expires without a matching string being received, it increments a variable and tries again, branching after three tries to label 47 which aborts with a timeout error. We'll assume the modem replied with </p><tt>OK</tt><p>, which will move us to label 2.

(Comment lines start with <tt>!</tt>, or could be appended with whitespace after a valid statement.) The <tt>DsplyPic</tt> keyword lights up one of the icons in the connection dialogue, in this case the first one, and then the next string is shown, which interpolates the built-in variable <tt>FONE</tt> to show the user the telephone number:

The dial string is then constructed from the Hayes </p><tt>ATD</tt><p> command, whether tone or pulse dialing in the built-in variable </p><tt>TONE</tt><p>, and then the phone number. If it successfully gets any unambiguous part of the string </p><tt>CONNECT</tt><p>, it will assume success and move on to label 4. Strings like </p><tt>BUSY</tt><p> and </p><tt>CARRIER</tt><p> (as in </p><tt>NO CARRIER</tt><p>) branch to their own handlers. If the connection doesn't go through and isn't otherwise handled, the </p><tt>JSR 20</tt><p> calls a subroutine at label 20 which tries to hang up and reset the modem before dialing again.

<p><em>Now</em> we see the structure of the logon string it's sending: the AppleLink ID and its password (separately prompted for) are appended as a parameters, apparently twice and followed by several other keywords and variables, though we don't know the exact content of all these variables yet. We can also see all the possible messages GCOS could send back, most of which are errors, like (</p><tt>SER</tt><p>)</p><tt>VICE INTERRUPTED</tt><p> or (</p><tt>SY</tt><p>)SYEM UNAVAIL(</p><tt>ABLE</tt><p>). Only one of these, what looks like </p><tt>SYSTEM REA</tt><p>(</p><tt>DY</tt><p>), actually leads to a success state, and that's label 36:
</p><div><pre>-LABEL 36 -- Boxes 5 and 6  (entering system)

This starts the client's EFX handler and then exits back into the application with return code 0, indicating success. The failure labels all return with -1.
</p><p>
Now that we know what the connection script is looking for, we can type the responses it's expecting back to it. To avoid any potential conflicts with the internal modem, I'll configure AppleLink to communicate via the printer port to a null modem connected with my Raptor Talos II. (Impressively, this client version supports up to 19.2kbps, which would have been quite something in 1991. Those speeds may have been intended for direct serial connections.) You'll note the script is explicitly terminating everything it sends with a carriage return, so for display purposes we'll have <tt>picocom</tt> translate those to line feeds. Again, <b>bold</b> is what I typed back.

I'm not sure why the exact same user string is sent twice except with an exclamation point, but the rest includes the client version and presumably an encoded date of revision instead of today's date. This seems to be everything the mainframe would need to fire up EFX and start communicating with the client. 

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhOm7d5U3nW-xyxI75xos9hmMY8NZaqnmgszGPZ5qJ6_V03JqXYHQGxbCJwkd6Cri4u_KxhptJmaD4Pvh9K-wjLY0VsC2PwFizavt645EdWVzyOJwGpQQz788kt6EVkw5AmUYHpb0r3gASB5bK2BuCZE0v3lCOU9KuQD94WQtIVNORma4vynk2UIG4uvPw/s640/Screen%205.PNG"><img alt="" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhOm7d5U3nW-xyxI75xos9hmMY8NZaqnmgszGPZ5qJ6_V03JqXYHQGxbCJwkd6Cri4u_KxhptJmaD4Pvh9K-wjLY0VsC2PwFizavt645EdWVzyOJwGpQQz788kt6EVkw5AmUYHpb0r3gASB5bK2BuCZE0v3lCOU9KuQD94WQtIVNORma4vynk2UIG4uvPw/s320/Screen%205.PNG" width="320"></a></p><p>

Indeed, all of the preceding screenshots were generated with that very sequence, demonstrating the client will accept our responses. But unfortunately I don't know anything about EFX, so we can't currently fake anything further. I don't see any activity on the serial port despite this message and we inevitably time out.

... and then this final message before the client gives up completely, which I suspect our intrepid astronauts on Space Shuttle Atlantis also got a few times, though for a completely different reason.
</p><p>
Let's finish the AppleLink story before we close. By the end of 1985 AppleLink was a roaring success, at least in user terms, handling over 4,000 calls a day. This demonstrated to GE the concept could have some utility to other corporations besides Apple, and in December 1985 GE decided to use the same technology as AppleLink in their own product, Businesstalk. Businesstalk was envisioned for any company with a large dealer network, not just computer companies, many of which would have been battling the same problems and expenses. The client was also Mac-specific and built with the same codebase, at least initially, but GEISCO's charges were heftier at $35/hr prime time and $18/hr off, presumably with the assumption that (like Apple) interested companies would partially subsidize the rate. To GE's dismay few seemed interested, so in February 1986 GE relaunched Businesstalk as Dealertalk, using the same Mac client but instead at an introductory price of $9900 that included a site license, 15 days of training and 100 hours of free connect time. The price was intended to stoke interest since GE threatened it would rise to $20,000 after July 31. It was similarly unsuccessful.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRkpDETA21eQesqKkh10Qx6SPY4bEqTSWd-5LioRwyIsHpHLvonDsDh-iOEoykLsgrDci1gmOyM6r532UCp1_kUymgtP_MqpRwVqe0jUn1iBoqPOz1_EbubH9ChUR2CAX7VZ1RSB4munztBFu7m3zqXGTTno1Y_rkquLiyLu4ppW2koRbRhxpROnbzEnw/s1600/btalk.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="1134" data-original-width="1600" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRkpDETA21eQesqKkh10Qx6SPY4bEqTSWd-5LioRwyIsHpHLvonDsDh-iOEoykLsgrDci1gmOyM6r532UCp1_kUymgtP_MqpRwVqe0jUn1iBoqPOz1_EbubH9ChUR2CAX7VZ1RSB4munztBFu7m3zqXGTTno1Y_rkquLiyLu4ppW2koRbRhxpROnbzEnw/s320/btalk.jpg" width="320"></a></p>

<!-- IW 12/86--><p>In December 1986 GE tried once more under the BusinessTalk name again (but note the camel case), unveiling a PC client alongside the Mac version and marketing the service more as a corporate private bulletin board. It was still $20,000 and the rate crept up to $36/hour, but there was no limit on the number of clients that could connect. Possibly it was the unlimited number of machines or maybe eliminating the requirement to buy Macintoshes, but either way the third time was finally a charm. By 1989 (the screenshot is from Infoworld showing the MS-DOS version of Business Talk 5.0) users could communicate with other corporate E-mail systems like Wang Office, DEC All-in-1 and IBM DISOSS and could even send messages by fax. While it was still $20,000 to start, GE had enough business that the connect rates were a more modest $23/hr prime and $15/hr off by then, and Business Talk became used by diverse companies such as financial company Charles Schwab to form SchwabLink. Despite being notionally separate universes, Business Talk instances and AppleLink nevertheless all ran on the same platform, and messages could be sent and received between each other as well. (These later software clients likely used a form of EFX also, so it may be possible to figure out how it worked from them, but probably even fewer examples of those still survive.)
</p><p>
Meanwhile, although allegedly saving them more than they spent, Apple was chafing under the substantial amount of money they paid GE to keep AppleLink operational. As more dealers and developers joined the system, the more expensive it got (<i>Apple Confidential</i> cited a ballpark fee of $30 million annually), and GE was unwilling to renegotiate. It even got bad enough that Apple later sold CD-ROMs with AppleLink content on them as a cheaper "offline" version to dampen interest.
</p><p>
In 1987 Apple approached Steve Case, then running Quantum Computer Services and the very successful QuantumLink online service for the Commodore 64, to develop a cheaper alternative to which AppleLink content could eventually be transferred. AppleLink Personal Edition ran atop Quantum's Stratus-based platform via Telenet and débuted first on the Apple II in May 1988, but Apple and Quantum squabbled over the future direction of the service and users complained about missing features that the "real" AppleLink had. (In addition, some of GE's code and protocols were allegedly used without permission, further souring the relationship.) Apple eventually paid off Quantum to get out of the contract and the Mac version as such was never released. Instead, Quantum used that money to finish the Mac client without the Apple branding but using the same underlying infrastructure, and in 1991 that client became part of Quantum's new America Online.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj9XVSH0XAC3v8aXDAcr8S86zfCErYia7CpAo9mtWpLvJ5l__WH6VJ9xZnvnR0ssLxBl9zxzvuTfklAGLv7DZ4ivbD_mbV_gsDYbJt3QdT3bJdHYBGCu_Z6l48qwMWY-AtGH6WfJ78rKOg8A2xJ7z6bOl7TmGVotbY0sMAgVPfKR4_rssr86ANItdoAMcA/s1954/byeworld.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="906" data-original-width="1954" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj9XVSH0XAC3v8aXDAcr8S86zfCErYia7CpAo9mtWpLvJ5l__WH6VJ9xZnvnR0ssLxBl9zxzvuTfklAGLv7DZ4ivbD_mbV_gsDYbJt3QdT3bJdHYBGCu_Z6l48qwMWY-AtGH6WfJ78rKOg8A2xJ7z6bOl7TmGVotbY0sMAgVPfKR4_rssr86ANItdoAMcA/s320/byeworld.jpg" width="320"></a></p><p>

Although Apple had managed to cut AppleLink costs somewhat in the meantime, continued high expenditures eventually caused the company to open a new request for proposals, and in 1992 they went back to Quantum again which was now also called America Online. In return for Apple paying AOL royalties, Apple would receive a stake in the company and layer an AppleLink replacement on top of AOL's infrastructure that would additionally be offered to consumers. Due to Apple corporate turmoil the new online service, christened eWorld, didn't launch until June 1994 and ended up directly competing with other new and established ones like AOL itself, Delphi, CompuServe, Prodigy and, yes, GEnie. Apple had priced its hourly rates high to temper demand, but that ended up working too well, and they failed to even include it consistently with new Macs they sold. Apple eventually forced the issue by moving employees from AppleLink to eWorld to beef up traffic and, after Gil Amelio cancelled eWorld in March 1996, started migrating to Web-based intranet alternatives rather than move people back. AppleLink was finally shut down on March 31, 1997.

As it happens, a similar process happened with GEIS. In April 1992 GE announced plans for BusinessTalk 2000, a repackaging of the service adding a Windows client to its Mac and DOS support, X.400 and X.500 message exchange, more online databases for access, and single seats starting as low as $279 (the site license increased to $30,000). By then, however, the growing Internet had started to erode customer interest in proprietary network products, especially GEIS' core Electronic Data Interchange services. GEnie, though still successful, suffered from a lack of expansion because it was only ever intended to use up excess computing capacity and GEIS' weakening revenue couldn't justify additional hardware. GEIS sold it off in 1996 as other clients started moving away from GE's proprietary services to Web-based alternatives (the screenshot above of the historical GEIS website comes from <a href="https://www.ammannato.it/geis-alumni/">this remembrance</a>). Both GEnie (under new owners Yovelle and later telecom IDT) and the Mark III network eventually succumbed to Y2K, as the GCOS version in use didn't handle it and it would have been too costly to move them to new platforms, and both shut down in December 1999. The majority of GEIS was reorganized as GXS (GE Global Exchange Services) in 2000, spun off in 2002, and subsequently bought out by OpenText in 2014.

<h2 id="cs-6120-advanced-compilers-the-self-guided-online-course">CS 6120: Advanced Compilers: The Self-Guided Online Course</h2>
<p>CS 6120 is a PhD-level <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/">Cornell CS</a> course by <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/">Adrian Sampson</a> on programming language implementation.
It covers universal compilers topics like intermediate representations, data flow, and “classic” optimizations as well as more research-flavored topics such as parallelization, just-in-time compilation, and garbage collection.
The work consists of reading papers and open-source hacking tasks, which use <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> and <a href="https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/bril/">an educational IR invented just for this class</a>.</p>
<p>This page lists the curriculum for following this course at the university of your imagination, for four imagination credits (ungraded).
There’s a linear timeline of lessons interspersed with papers to read.
Each lesson has videos and written notes, and some have <em>implementation tasks</em> for you to complete.
Tasks are all open-ended, to one degree or another, and are meant to solidify your understanding of the abstract concepts by turning them into real code.
The order represents a suggested interleaving of video-watching and paper-reading.</p>
<p>Some differences with the “real” CS 6120 are that you can ignore the task deadlines and you can’t participate in our discussion threads on Zulip.
Real 6120 also has an end-of-semester course project—in the self-guided version, your end-of-semester assignment is to change the world through the magic of compilers.</p>
<p>The instructor is a video production neophyte, so please excuse the production values, especially in the early lessons.
CS 6120 is <a href="https://github.com/sampsyo/cs6120">open source and on GitHub</a>, so please file bugs if you find problems.</p>
<p>When you finish the course, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/GuRiMa728DUvTbZQ7">this feedback form</a>.</p>
