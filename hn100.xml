<p><strong>Increasing efforts against “radicalisation”</strong></p>
<p>The EU and its forerunners have targeted radicalism and “radicalisation” for <a href="https://www.tni.org/en/publication/the-globalisation-of-countering-violent-extremism-policies">decades</a>. This &nbsp;agenda gained a firmer hold <a href="https://www.statewatch.org/news/2013/july/eu-seeks-increased-surveillance-of-travel-and-social-media-to-deal-with-foreign-fighters/">in 2011</a>, when the European Commission established the Radicalisation Awareness Network.</p>
<p>In June this year, the Commission <a href="https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/internal-security/counter-terrorism-and-radicalisation/prevention-radicalisation/eu-knowledge-hub-radicalisation-prevention-20_en">launched</a> a new <a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://media/ac969f084247428a9b253f528940c845" href="https://www.statewatch.org/media/4525/eu-com-brochure-radicalisation-knowledge-hub-6-24.pdf" target="_blank" title="Eu Com Brochure Radicalisation Knowledge Hub 6 24">€60 million</a> (pdf) “Knowledge Hub” to further expand the agenda. The hub aims “to collaborate in a new way at the EU level to address the challenges posed by radicalisation.”</p>
<p>Around the same time, the Belgian Council presidency circulated a document (pdf) which “sums up the Presidency focus areas and initiatives for the past six months in the domain of counter-terrorism (CT)”. It says:</p>
<p><em>“</em><em>Member States should continue their efforts </em><em>to recognise and handle, at an early stage, public security threats stemming from individuals considered by national law enforcement authorities to constitute a violent extremist/terrorist threat.”</em></p>
<p>This would rely on information on these individuals being entered into EU databases, such as the Schengen Information System or Europol’s files. The document says information should be entered “where possible and in line with national and EU legislation.”</p>
<p><strong>Informal definition of “potential terrorist”</strong></p>
<p>These plans build upon a recent “shared understanding” of who EU authorities consider a "potential terrorist or violent extremist threat,” a concept encapsulated in the document by the German term <em>Gefährder</em>. The German authorities introduced the phrase and the topic of “potential terrorists” into EU institutions.</p>
<p>The Council’s internal security committee (COSI) approved this “shared understanding” <a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://media/ab42a726c66147f8a70989d76791367a" href="https://www.statewatch.org/media/4527/eu-council-cosi-minutes-10752-24.pdf" target="_blank" title="Eu Council Cosi Minutes 10752 24">in May this year</a> (pdf).</p>
<p>By framing it as a “shared understanding”, COSI avoided legal reforms. This would have required lengthy negotiations, as well as an opportunity for democratic scrutiny.</p>
<p>The document that sets out <a rel="noopener" data-udi="umb://media/ab8ea0d926e64d4f9bbf3b2ea8d4aaf4" href="https://www.statewatch.org/media/4526/eu-council-gefahrder-shared-understanding-9988-24.pdf" target="_blank" title="Eu Council Gefahrder Shared Understanding 9988 24">the definition</a> (pdf) notes:</p>
<p><em>“The criteria are strictly <strong>non-binding</strong> and do not affect the existing mechanisms and procedures already established at European and national level. Their goal is to promote entering such individuals into the European databases and information systems by the Member States subject to the legal requirements governing these systems.” (emphasis in original)</em></p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.statewatch.org/news/2024/may/who-s-a-potential-terrorist-or-violent-extremist-threat-plans-to-exchange-information-about-future-criminals/">previously reported by <em>Statewatch</em></a>, the criteria consist of three points.</p>
<ol>
<li>A “minimum materiality threshold”. This requires “objective and verifiable… information suggesting that a criminal offence, or future criminal offence, has a certain degree of seriousness.”</li>
<li>A “basic indicative criterion”. This requires “objective, verifiable information” leading to a belief that the individual in question “will in the future commit, facilitate, support or engage in terrorist or violent extremist offences.”</li>
<li>A series of “indicative auxiliary criteria”. This could be involvement in terrorist offences, sharing terrorist content online, or being the subject of an EU entry ban.</li>
</ol>
<p>This Council initiative comes at the same time as the EU’s rollout of new information systems and an updated Europol mandate. These developments will massively expand the EU’s collection of information on “risky” individuals.</p>
<p>Through this “shared understanding”, the Council of the EU has created space for a new, informal practice. It will likely permit the collection and sharing of data on far more people than those involved in terrorism and violence.</p>
<p><strong>The effects on asylum-seekers and refugees</strong></p>
<p>The Belgian Presidency document outlines categories of people who this new practice may cover. These include asylum seekers and refugees, as well as climate and environmental activists.</p>
<p>The document notes the “limited” number of asylum seekers and refugees involved in terrorism and violence, but the new initiative adds to others that frame them as suspects.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.statewatch.org/news/2024/march/eu-intelligence-sharing-plan-extended-from-asylum-seekers-to-any-foreigner-involved-in-a-migratory-procedure/"><em>Statewatch</em> reported in March</a>, this includes an expanded intelligence-sharing plan introduced by the Belgian Presidency. This seeks to “strengthen cooperation and exchange of information between immigration and asylum authorities and between CT [counter-terrorism] authorities,” likely to be policing and intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>They justify this as a response to “terrorist attacks in Europe” that have “triggered a debate on how to better prevent future attacks.”</p>
<p><strong>The effects on climate and environmental activists</strong></p>
<p>The EU’s interest in “radicalisation” also targets climate and environmental activists. The recent Belgian Presidency document states:</p>
<p><em>“Climate activism is on the rise, together with an increased willingness to use violence, marking a shift from environmental activism to <strong>environmental extremism</strong>” (emphasis in original).</em></p>
<p>To back this up, the document refers to a report by the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, which purportedly examined “the role climate change and environmental concerns play in the ideologies and narratives of violent extremists and terrorists in the EU.”</p>
<p>Yet, the report itself said it was largely speculative:</p>
<p><em>“The potential for terrorism and violent extremism linked to the environment and climate change is at this moment limited but might become more significant in the coming years.”</em></p>
<p>The Belgian Presidency document included a similar note on the “limited” number of asylum seekers and refugees involved in terrorism and violence. Yet, both groups remain targets of the EU’s agenda against “radicalisation”.</p>
<p>The UN Special Rapporteur on Environmental Defenders under the Aarhus Convention has <a href="https://www.statewatch.org/media/4190/un-unsr-environmental-protest-civil-disobedience-crackdowns-28-2-24.pdf">issued a warning</a> that:</p>
<p><em>“…the conflation of peaceful climate activism with radicalisation and terrorism may increase polarisation by wrongly labelling activists as radicals and trivialising terrorism.” </em></p>
<p>Harsh sentences are being handed down to peaceful climate protesters by both EU member states and the UK. The latter remains closely tied to the EU’s policing structures through its cooperation with Europol.</p>
<p>For example, at the end of August, <em>Climate Rights International</em> <a href="https://cri.org/reports/on-thin-ice/">reported</a>:</p>
<p><em>“…a German court sentenced 65-year-old Winfried Lorenz to 22 months in prison without parole, for his involvement in a climate protest that blocked a road. It is believed to be the longest sentence ever imposed in Berlin against a climate activist.”</em></p>

                                    <p>In 2022, EU member states began discussing ways to increase the amount of information sent to intelligence agencies on "the timing and state of progress of applications for international protection lodged by individuals posing a terrorist threat". Now the intention is to cover not just asylum-seekers, but "any foreigner involved in a migratory procedure." According to the Belgian Presidency, "security concerns go beyond the mere scope of applicants for international protection, as they also cover other people who apply for the legal right to stay in Europe."</p>

The inclusion of peaceful but disruptive groups in the paper may legitimate further police surveillance and infiltration, legal harassment and government crackdowns – a problem identified as “a major threat to human rights and democracy” by a UN Special Rapporteur.</p>

<p>Binge-watching television, watching YouTube videos for hours, or scrolling on your phone every morning may seem harmless, but research shows that too much screen time may be detrimental to your health.</p>
<p>We know children’s brains are affected by spending too much time glued to their cell phones,&nbsp;however&nbsp;research shows that adult brains are also negatively impacted by excessive screen time, defined as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/wecan/reduce-screen-time/index.htm">more than two hours</a>&nbsp;a day outside of work hours.</p>
<p>Too much screen time can impact our health in a myriad of ways, from eye strain and neck pain to social isolation and mental health, and in some cases, it may cause harm to our brains.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The negative effects of screen time are insidious because you can’t see what’s happening in your brain as you’re staring at the screen,” says Maris Loeffler, MA, Family and Marriage Therapist, member of the Stanford Lifestyle Medicine Cognitive Enhancement pillar. “If you scrolled on your phone in bed for an hour just one morning, the negative impacts would be minimal. But if it becomes a habit, day after day, month after month, this behavior can take a toll.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the eyes&nbsp;are directly connected&nbsp;to the brain, Loeffler encourages us to think about our eye health to ensure overall brain health. Rather than looking at our phones upon waking, Loeffler recommends starting each morning looking at the horizon or an object outside and far away.</p>
<p>To prevent eye strain throughout the workday,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aao.org/">The American Academy of Ophthalmology</a>&nbsp;recommends the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/computer-usage#:~:text=Take%20regular%20breaks%20using%20the,for%20at%20least%2020%20seconds.">20-20-20 rule</a>&nbsp;for adults who work on a computer. This rule suggests that individuals look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes of the day.</p>
<h2>What is Happening in the Brain During Screen Time?</h2>
<p>This <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-019-00182-2">study</a> found that increased use of screens among adults may harm learning, memory, and mental health, as well as the potential to increase the risk of early neurodegeneration. The study shows that in adults aged 18 – 25, excessive screen time causes thinning of the cerebral cortex, the brain’s outermost layer responsible for processing memory and cognitive functions, such as decision-making and problem-solving.</p>
<p>Another&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1525861024002263">study</a> found that adults who watched television for five hours or more per day had an increased risk of developing brain-related disease like dementia, stroke, or Parkinson’s.</p>
<p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9638701/">study</a>&nbsp;found that excessive screen time can hinder sleep, especially when looking at screens late at night. Light from the screen can delay melatonin release from the brain’s pineal gland, impacting the body’s natural circadian rhythm and causing difficulty sleeping.</p>
<p>Additional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imrpress.com/journal/JIN/21/1/10.31083/j.jin2101028/htm">studies</a>&nbsp;found that adults who engage in excessive screen time or have a diagnosed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460319313802#b0080">smartphone addiction</a>&nbsp;had lower&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553239/#:~:text=%5B1%5D%20Grey%20matter%20makes%20up,concentration%20of%20neuronal%20cell%20bodies.">gray matter</a>&nbsp;volume. Gray matter is brain tissue essential for daily human functioning and is responsible for everything from movement to memory to emotions.&nbsp;Gray matter volume naturally decreases as we age, so along with reducing screen time, engaging in activities that maintain our gray matter volume and promote brain health, such as exercise and movement, restorative sleep, social engagement, and stress management, is crucial.</p>
<p>“Passive screen time is like eating sugar but for your brain.&nbsp;It&nbsp;‘tastes’&nbsp;good, and you want it now, but you’re not&nbsp;actually&nbsp;feeding yourself.&nbsp;You’re not giving your brain any nutrition,” says Loeffler. “Instead, replace screen time with an intentional healthy habit that&nbsp;feeds your brain in a healthy way. Lifestyle medicine activities, like exercise, good sleep, social connection, and stress management, function like ‘nutrition’ for your brain and mental health.”</p>
<p>Specifically, Loeffler cautions us not to pick up the phone after the alarm goes off in the morning. She explains that looking at our email or social media on our phones while still in bed jolts the nervous system and can trigger the fight-or-flight response since we aren’t fully awake yet.</p>
<p>Also, if we look at our&nbsp;phones&nbsp;first thing&nbsp;every&nbsp;morning, we create a pattern and can set the flight-or-flight response as our default mode of operation. So, not only does this behavior set an anxiety-filled tone for the day, but&nbsp;we are also training our brains to be more hypervigilant in general.</p>
<p><strong>“One of the biggest issues with picking up the phone right away in the morning is that when you have an object close to your face, it’s registered as a threat,” says Loeffler. “You wouldn’t want to wake up and look a bear in the face every morning. On a physiological level, it’s the same thing.”</strong></p>
<h2>Practice of the Month: No Screen Time for the First Hour of the Day</h2>
<p>Stanford Lifestyle Medicine experts recommend no screen time for the first hour of the day to support cognitive enhancement. Instead, we suggest engaging in a lifestyle medicine activity upon waking to promote whole-body health:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Call a friend or family member</li>
<li>Prepare a healthy <a href="https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/2024/04/08/dr-spencers-science-based-smoothie-for-gut-health/">breakfast</a></li>
<li>Meditate and count your&nbsp;<a href="https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/2023/11/14/optimism-as-a-means-to-a-longer-life/">blessings</a></li>
<li>Listen to music</li>
<li>Create a&nbsp;<a href="https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/2023/11/14/gratitude-is-good-medicine/">gratitude</a>&nbsp;list</li>
<li>Read a book</li>
<li>Spend time outside and get&nbsp;<a href="https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/2024/03/11/vitamin-d-benefits-sources-deficiency/">morning light</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>“How do you want your day’s energy and mood to start?” says Loeffler. “Intentionally implementing a morning routine that reflects lifestyle medicine choices instead of screen time sets a positive tone for the day and supports brain health and cognitive enhancement.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Yesterday I was thinking about how long it took me to get a colorscheme in my
terminal that I was mostly happy with (SO MANY YEARS), and it made me wonder
what about terminal colours made it so hard.</p>

<p>So I <a href="https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/113226972156366201">asked people on Mastodon</a> what problems
they’ve run into with colours in the terminal, and I got a ton of interesting
responses! Let’s talk about some of the problems and a few possible ways to fix
them.</p>

<h3 id="problem-1-blue-on-black">problem 1: blue on black</h3>

<p>One of the top complaints was “blue on black is hard to read”. Here’s an
example of that: if I open Terminal.app, set the background to black, and run
<code>ls</code>, the directories are displayed in a blue that isn’t that easy to read:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-blue.png"></p>

<p>To understand why we’re seeing this blue, let’s talk about ANSI colours!</p>

<h3 id="the-16-ansi-colours">the 16 ANSI colours</h3>

<p>Your terminal has 16 numbered colours – black, red, green, yellow, blue,
magenta, cyan, white, and “bright” version of each of those.</p>

<p>Programs can use them by printing out an “ANSI escape code” – for example if
you want to see each of the 16 colours in your terminal, you can run this
Python program:</p>

<pre><code>def color(num, text):
    return f"\033[38;5;{num}m{text}\033[0m"

for i in range(16):
    print(color(i, f"number {i:02}"))
</code></pre>

<h3 id="what-are-the-ansi-colours">what are the ANSI colours?</h3>

<p>This made me wonder – if blue is colour number 5, who decides what hex color
that should correspond to?</p>

<p>The answer seems to be “there’s no standard, terminal emulators just choose
colours and it’s not very consistent”. Here’s a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors">screenshot of a table from Wikipedia</a>, where you
can see that there’s a lot of variation:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/wikipedia.png"></p>

<h3 id="problem-1-5-bright-yellow-on-white">problem 1.5: bright yellow on white</h3>

<p>Bright yellow on white is even worse than blue on black, here’s what I get in
a terminal with the default settings:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-yellow.png"></p>

<p>That’s almost impossible to read (and some other colours like light green cause
similar issues), so let’s talk about solutions!</p>

<h3 id="two-ways-to-reconfigure-your-colours">two ways to reconfigure your colours</h3>

<p>If you’re annoyed by these colour contrast issues (or maybe you just think the
default ANSI colours are ugly), you might think – well, I’ll just choose a
different “blue” and pick something I like better!</p>

<p>There are two ways you can do this:</p>

<p><strong>Way 1: Configure your terminal emulator</strong>: I think most modern terminal emulators
   have a way to reconfigure the colours, and some of them even come with some
   preinstalled themes that you might like better than the defaults.</p>

<p><strong>Way 2: Run a shell script</strong>: There are ANSI escape codes that you can print
out to tell your terminal emulator to reconfigure its colours. <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell/blob/master/scripts/base16-solarized-light.sh">Here’s a shell script that does that</a>,
from the <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell">base16-shell</a> project.
You can see that it has a few different conventions for changing the colours –
I guess different terminal emulators have different escape codes for changing
their colour palette, and so the script is trying to pick the right style of
escape code based on the <code>TERM</code> environment variable.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-the-2-ways-of-configuring-your-colours">what are the pros and cons of the 2 ways of configuring your colours?</h3>

<p>I prefer to use the “shell script” method, because:</p>

<ul>
<li>if I switch terminal emulators for some reason, I don’t need to a different configuration system, my colours still Just Work</li>
<li>I use <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell">base16-shell</a> with base16-vim to make my vim colours match my terminal colours, which is convenient</li>
</ul>

<p>The main advantage I can think of for configuring colours in your terminal
emulator is that, if you use a popular terminal emulator, there are probably a
lot of nice terminal themes out there that you can choose from. I think there are some more advantages I’m not thinking of though.</p>

<p>This is what my shell has looked like for probably the last 5 years (using the
solarized light base16 theme), and I’m pretty happy with it. Here’s <code>htop</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-my-colours.png"></p>

<p>Okay, so let’s say you’ve found a terminal colorscheme that you like. What else
can go wrong?</p>

<h3 id="problem-2-programs-using-256-colours">problem 2: programs using 256 colours</h3>

<p>Here’s what some output of <code>fd</code>, a <code>find</code> alternative, looks like in my
colorscheme:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-problem-fd.png"></p>

<p>The contrast is pretty bad here, and I definitely don’t have that lime green in
my normal colorscheme. What’s going on?</p>

<p>We can see what color codes <code>fd</code> is using using the <code>unbuffer</code> program to
capture its output including the color codes:</p>

<pre><code>$ unbuffer fd . &gt; out
$ vim out
[38;5;48mbad-again.sh[0m
[38;5;48mbad.sh[0m
[38;5;48mbetter.sh[0m
out
</code></pre>

<p><code>[38;5;48</code> means “set the foreground color to color <code>48</code>”. Terminals don’t
only have 16 colours – many terminals these days actually have 3 ways of
specifying colours:</p>

<ol>
<li>the 16 ANSI colours we already talked about</li>
<li>an extended set of 256 colours</li>
<li>a further extended set of 24-bit hex colours, like <code>#ffea03</code></li>
</ol>

<p>So <code>fd</code> is using one of the colours from the extended 256-color set. <code>bat</code> (a
<code>cat</code> alternative) does something similar – here’s what it looks like by
default in my terminal.</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-bat.png"></p>

<p>This looks fine though and it really seems like it’s trying to work well with a
variety of terminal themes.</p>

<h3 id="some-newer-tools-seem-to-have-theme-support">some newer tools seem to have theme support</h3>

<p>I think it’s interesting that some of these newer terminal tools (<code>fd</code>, <code>cat</code>,
<code>delta</code>, and probably more) have support for arbitrary custom themes. I guess
the downside of this approach is that the default theme might clash with your
terminal’s background, but the upside is that it gives you a lot more control
over theming the tool’s output than just choosing 16 ANSI colours.</p>

<p>I don’t really use <code>bat</code>, but if I did I’d probably use <code>bat --theme ansi</code> to
just use the ANSI colours that I have set in my normal terminal colorscheme.</p>

<h3 id="problem-3-the-grays-in-solarized">problem 3: the grays in Solarized</h3>

<p>A bunch of people on Mastodon mentioned a specific issue with grays in the
Solarized theme: when I list a directory, the base16 Solarized Light theme
looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-solarized-base16.png"></p>

<p>but iTerm’s default Solarized Light theme looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-solarized-iterm.png"></p>

<p>This is because in the iTerm theme (which is the <a href="https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/#the-values">original Solarized design</a>), colors 9-14 (the “bright blue”, “bright
red”, etc) are mapped to a series of grays, and when I run <code>ls</code>, it’s trying to
use those “bright” colours to color my directories and executables.</p>

<p>My best guess for why the original Solarized theme is designed this way is to
make the grays available to the <a href="https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized/blob/528a59f26d12278698bb946f8fb82a63711eec21/colors/solarized.vim">vim Solarized colorscheme</a>.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure I prefer the modified base16 version I use where the “bright”
colours are actually colours instead of all being shades of gray though. (I
didn’t actually realize the version I was using wasn’t the “original” Solarized
theme until I wrote this post)</p>

<h3 id="problem-4-a-vim-theme-that-doesn-t-match-the-terminal-background">problem 4: a vim theme that doesn’t match the terminal background</h3>

<p>If I my vim theme has a different background colour than my terminal theme, I
get this ugly border, like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-vim-black-bg.png"></p>

<p>This one is a pretty minor issue though and I think making your terminal
background match your vim background is pretty straightforward.</p>

<h3 id="problem-5-programs-setting-a-background-color">problem 5: programs setting a background color</h3>

<p>A few people mentioned problems with terminal applications setting an
unwanted background colour, so let’s look at an example of that.</p>

<p>Here <code>ngrok</code> has set the background to color #16 (“black”), but the
<code>base16-shell</code> script I use sets color 16 to be bright orange, so I get this,
which is pretty bad:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-ngrok-solarized.png"></p>

<p>I think the intention is for ngrok to look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-ngrok-regular.png"></p>

<p>I think <code>base16-shell</code> sets color #16 to orange (instead of black)
so that it can provide extra colours for use by <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim/blob/3be3cd82cd31acfcab9a41bad853d9c68d30478d/colors/base16-solarized-light.vim">base16-vim</a>.
This feels reasonable to me – I use <code>base16-vim</code> in the terminal, so I guess I’m
using that feature and it’s probably more important to me than <code>ngrok</code> (which I
rarely use) behaving a bit weirdly.</p>

<p>This particular issue is a maybe obscure clash between ngrok and my colorschem,
but I think this kind of clash is pretty common when a program sets an ANSI
background color that the user has remapped for some reason.</p>

<h3 id="a-nice-solution-to-contrast-issues-minimum-contrast">a nice solution to contrast issues: “minimum contrast”</h3>

<p>A bunch of terminals (iTerm2, <a href="https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby">tabby</a>, kitty’s <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf/#opt-kitty.text_fg_override_threshold">text_fg_override_threshold</a>, and
folks tell me also Ghostty and Windows Terminal) have a “minimum
contrast” feature that will automatically adjust colours to make sure they have enough contrast.</p>

<p>Here’s an example from iTerm. This ngrok accident from before has pretty bad
contrast, I find it pretty difficult to read:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-ngrok-solarized.png"></p>

<p>With “minimum contrast” set to 40 in iTerm, it looks like this instead:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-ngrok-solarized-contrast.png"></p>

<p>I didn’t have minimum contrast turned on before but I just turned it on today
because it makes such a big difference when something goes wrong with colours
in the terminal.</p>

<h3 id="problem-6-term-being-set-to-the-wrong-thing">problem 6: <code>TERM</code> being set to the wrong thing</h3>

<p>A few people mentioned that they’ll SSH into a system that doesn’t support the
<code>TERM</code> environment variable that they have set locally, and then the colours
won’t work.</p>

<p>I think the way <code>TERM</code> works is that systems have a <code>terminfo</code> database, so if
the value of the <code>TERM</code> environment variable isn’t in the system’s terminfo
database, then it won’t know how to output colours for that terminal. I don’t
know too much about terminfo, but someone linked me to this <a href="https://twoot.site/@bean/113056942625234032">terminfo rant</a> that talks about a few other
issues with terminfo.</p>

<p>I don’t have a system on hand to reproduce this one so I can’t say for sure how
to fix it, but <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/67537/prevent-ssh-client-passing-term-environment-variable-to-server">this stackoverflow question</a>
suggests running something like <code>TERM=xterm ssh</code> instead of <code>ssh</code>.</p>

<h3 id="problem-7-picking-good-colours-is-hard">problem 7: picking “good” colours is hard</h3>

<p>A couple of problems people mentioned with designing / finding terminal colorschemes:</p>

<ul>
<li>some folks are colorblind and have trouble finding an appropriate colorscheme</li>
<li>accidentally making the background color too close to the cursor or selection color, so they’re hard to find</li>
<li>generally finding colours that work with every program is a struggle (for example you can see me having a problem with this with ngrok above!)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problem-8-making-nethack-mc-look-right">problem 8: making nethack/mc look right</h3>

<p>Another problem people mentioned is using a program like nethack or midnight
commander which you might expect to have a specific colourscheme based on the
default ANSI terminal colours.</p>

<p>For example, midnight commander has a really specific classic look:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-mc-normal.png"></p>

<p>But in my Solarized theme, midnight commander looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-mc-solarized.png"></p>

<p>The Solarized version feels like it could be disorienting if you’re
very used to the “classic” look.</p>

<p>One solution Simon Tatham mentioned to this is using some palette customization
ANSI codes (like the ones base16 uses that I talked about earlier) to change
the color palette right before starting the program, for example remapping
yellow to a brighter yellow before starting Nethack so that the yellow
characters look better.</p>

<h3 id="problem-9-commands-disabling-colours-when-writing-to-a-pipe">problem 9: commands disabling colours when writing to a pipe</h3>

<p>If I run <code>fd | less</code>, I see something like this, with the colours disabled.</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-fd-bw.png"></p>

<p>In generan I find this useful – if I pipe a command to <code>grep</code>, I don’t want it
to print out all those color escape codes, I just want the plain text. But what if you want to see the colours?</p>

<p>To see the colours, you can run <code>unbuffer fd | less -r</code>! I just learned about
<code>unbuffer</code> recently and I think it’s really cool, <code>unbuffer</code> opens a tty for the
command to write to so that it thinks it’s writing to a TTY. It also fixes
issues with programs buffering their output when writing to a pipe, which is
why it’s called <code>unbuffer</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s what the output of <code>unbuffer fd | less -r</code> looks like for me:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-fd-color.png"></p>

<h3 id="problem-10-unwanted-colour-in-ls-and-other-commands">problem 10: unwanted colour in <code>ls</code> and other commands</h3>

<p>Some people mentioned that they don’t want <code>ls</code> to use colour at all, perhaps
because <code>ls</code> uses blue, it’s hard to read on black, and maybe they don’t feel like
customizing their terminal’s colourscheme to make the blue more readable or
just don’t find the use of colour helpful.</p>

<p>Some possible solutions to this one:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can run <code>ls --color=never</code>, which is probably easiest</li>
<li>you can also set <code>LS_COLORS</code> to customize the colours used by <code>ls</code>. I think some other programs other than <code>ls</code> support the <code>LS_COLORS</code> environment variable too.</li>
<li>also some programs support setting <code>NO_COLOR=true</code> (there’s a <a href="https://no-color.org/">list here</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an example of running <code>LS_COLORS="fi=0:di=0:ln=0:pi=0:so=0:bd=0:cd=0:or=0:ex=0" ls</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/terminal-ls-colors.png"></p>

<h3 id="problem-11-the-colours-in-vim">problem 11: the colours in vim</h3>

<p>I used to have a lot of problems with configuring my colours in vim – I’d set
up my terminal colours in a way that I thought was okay, and then I’d start vim
and it would just be a disaster.</p>

<p>I think what was going on here is that today, there are two ways to set up a vim colorscheme in the terminal:</p>

<ol>
<li>using your ANSI terminal colours – you tell vim which ANSI colour number to use for the background, for functions, etc.</li>
<li>using 24-bit hex colours – instead of ANSI terminal colours, the vim colorscheme can use hex codes like #faea99 directly</li>
</ol>

<p>20 years ago when I started using vim, terminals with 24-bit hex color support
were a lot less common (or maybe they didn’t exist at all), and vim certainly
didn’t have support for using 24-bit colour in the terminal. From some quick
searching through git, it looks like <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/8a633e3427b47286869aa4b96f2bfc1fe65b25cd">vim added support for 24-bit colour in 2016</a>
– just 8 years ago!</p>

<p>So to get colours to work properly in vim before 2016, you needed to synchronize
your terminal colorscheme and your vim colorscheme. <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim/blob/3be3cd82cd31acfcab9a41bad853d9c68d30478d/colors/base16-solarized-light.vim#L52-L71">Here’s what that looked like</a>,
the colorscheme needed to map the vim color classes like <code>cterm05</code> to ANSI colour numbers.</p>

<p>But in 2024, the story is really different! Vim (and Neovim, which I use now)
support 24-bit colours, and as of Neovim 0.10 (released in May 2024), the
<code>termguicolors</code> setting (which tells Vim to use 24-bit hex colours for
colorschemes) is <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/news-0.10.html">turned on by default</a> in any terminal with 24-bit
color support.</p>

<p>So this “you need to synchronize your terminal colorscheme and your vim
colorscheme” problem is not an issue anymore for me in 2024, since I
don’t plan to use terminals without 24-bit color support in the future.</p>

<p>The biggest consequence for me of this whole thing is that I don’t need base16
to set colors 16-21 to weird stuff anymore to integrate with vim – I can just
use a terminal theme and a vim theme, and as long as the two themes use similar
colours (so it’s not jarring for me to switch between them) there’s no problem.
I think I can just remove those parts from my <code>base16</code> shell script and totally
avoid the problem with ngrok and the weird orange background I talked about
above.</p>

<h3 id="some-more-problems-i-left-out">some more problems I left out</h3>

<p>I think there are a lot of issues around the intersection of multiple programs,
like using some combination tmux/ssh/vim that I couldn’t figure out how to
reproduce well enough to talk about them. Also I’m sure I missed a lot of other
things too.</p>

<h3 id="okay-that-was-a-lot">okay, that was a lot</h3>

<p>We talked about a lot in this post and  while I think learning about all these
details is kind of fun if I’m in the mood to do a deep dive, I find it SO
FRUSTRATING to deal with it when I just want my colours to work! Being
surprised by unreadable text and having to find a workaround is just not my
idea of a good day.</p>

<p>Personally I’m a zero-configuration kind of person and it’s not that appealing
to me to have to put together a lot of custom configuration just to make my
colours in the terminal look acceptable. I’d much rather just have some
reasonable defaults that I don’t have to change.</p>

<h3 id="base16-has-really-worked-for-me">base16 has really worked for me</h3>

<p>I’ve personally had a lot of success with using
<a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell">base16-shell</a> with
<a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim">base16-vim</a> – I just need to add <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell?tab=readme-ov-file#fish">a couple of lines</a> to my
fish config to set it up (+ a few <code>.vimrc</code> lines) and then I can move on and
accept any remaining problems that that doesn’t solve.</p>

<p>I don’t think base16 is for everyone though, some limitations I’m aware
of with base16 that might make it not work for you:</p>

<ul>
<li>it comes with a limited set of builtin themes and you might not like any of them</li>
<li>the Solarized base16 theme (and maybe all of the themes?) sets the “bright”
ANSI colours to be exactly the same as the normal colours, which might cause
a problem if you’re relying on the “bright” colours to be different from the
regular ones</li>
<li>it sets colours 16-21 in order to give the vim colorschemes from <code>base16-vim</code>
access to more colours, which might not be relevant if you always use a
terminal with 24-bit color support, and can cause problems like the ngrok
issue above</li>
<li>also the way it sets colours 16-21 could be a problem in terminals that don’t have
256-color support</li>
</ul>

<p>Apparently there’s a community fork of base16 called
<a href="https://github.com/tinted-theming/home">tinted-theming</a>, which I haven’t
looked into much yet.</p>

<h3 id="some-other-colorscheme-tools">some other colorscheme tools</h3>

<p>Just one so far but I’ll link more if people tell me about them:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://rootloops.sh/">rootloops.sh</a> for generating colorschemes (and <a href="https://hamvocke.com/blog/lets-create-a-terminal-color-scheme/">“let’s create a terminal color scheme”</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="minimum-contrast-seems-like-an-amazing-feature">minimum contrast seems like an amazing feature</h3>

<p>My one big takeaway from writing this was to turn on “minimum contrast” in my
terminal, I think it’s going to fix most of the occasional accidental
unreadable text issues I run into and I’m pretty excited about it.</p>

It was in 2013, when Android was still the underdog compared to the iPhone, and was being touted as a great platform for developers. I’d taken two weeks to build <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/games/patchy/">Patchy</a>, a retro arcade game revamped for touch controls, and published it on the Google Play Store without any hassle. Since then, I’ve also published <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/games/twistago/">Twistago</a>, <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/games/rocket-mail/">Rocket Mail</a>, <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/blog/2015/6/14/bigcanvas-released/">Bigcanvas</a>, <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/projects/radio-nul/">Radio Nul</a> and <a href="https://frozenfractal.com/projects/papageno/">Papageno</a>.</p><p>With each next app, the bar for publishing kept getting higher. At some point, Google started publishing developers’ full company address on the store alongside the app. That’s fine for a professional company, but quite problematic for a solo indie developer who works from home, especially if the app <em>or the developer</em> is even remotely controversial. I worked around it at the time by just putting the name of the town instead of the full address, which is only right morally, but not legally.</p><p>The technical requirements also kept going up. To publish an update to an app, it has to target the latest API version, which goes up once or twice a year. Each API update comes with a slew of deprecations, and breaking changes to the already inscrutable build system. And even if you don’t want to update the app, Google will eventually start hiding apps from users if the app doesn’t target some minimum API version. This means you can’t just publish an app and leave it at that; it’s several days of work per app per year to keep up with the latest rug-pulls from Google. Again this is no problem for a company for whom the app is their core business, but bad news for indie and hobbyist developers who just want to make something cool, put it out there, and move on to the next project.</p><p>And then, there’s the latest increase in publishing requirements, the straw that broke the camel’s back, which made me decide to abandon the Google Play Store altogether.</p><h2 id="the-new-rules">The new rules</h2><p>The <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/boosting-trust-and-transparency-in-google-play.html">original announcement</a> just mentioned that organizations will need to provide a D-U-N-S number. It was possible to choose your own deadline, so I set it as far in the future as I could. Now that deadline, 5 November, is getting close, and I can start the verification process. The email, however, makes it clear that they want much more than a D-U-N-S number:</p><blockquote><p><strong>What you need to provide to verify</strong></p><ul><li>a D-U-N-S number for your organization<br>If you don’t have a D-U-N-S number, request one at no cost from Dun &amp; Bradstreet now. This process can take up to 30 days, so we recommend requesting a D-U-N-S number immediately. <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13628312#duns">Learn more about requesting a D-U-N-S number</a></li><li>a phone number and email address for Google Play users to contact you</li><li>a phone number and email address for Google to contact you</li><li>an official document to verify your identity</li><li>an official document to verify your organization</li></ul></blockquote><p>There is only one of these items that I don’t have a problem with.</p><p>The D-U-N-S number is only needed if your Play Store publisher account is for an organization, not an individual. But I’m registered as a sole proprietor, so the rule applies to me. You can <a href="https://www.dnb.com/duns-number/lookup.html">look up</a> your company’s D-U-N-S number, but the form doesn’t (currently?) allow selecting any country except the US. Dun &amp; Bradstreet’s partner in the Netherlands, <a href="https://www.altares.nl/en/our-data/duns-number/">Altares</a>, does allow me to look up my own company, but charges 15 € for the privilege of seeing my own data, <em>including my own D-U-N-S number</em>, which they’ve apparently already assigned when I registered with the Chamber of Commerce. If I didn’t already have one, I don’t see a way on their website to request one either, even though the FAQ mentions that you can (for a fee, of course).</p><p>While that may be just some paperwork and a small expense, the next requirement is more insidious: “a phone number and email address for Google Play users to contact you”. I’m fine showing an email address, but I <em>absolutely do not want</em> my phone number to be available to anyone on the internet. (Even for phone calls. But remember that a phone number is used for much more than phone calls these days.) And that’s just me, a privileged hetero white cis dude who is unlikely to be the target of harassment or doxxing.</p><p>The requirement “a phone number and email address for Google to contact you” is the only one that sounds benign to me, although I have yet to see Google trying to contact small-fry developers like me by phone, instead of just reaching for the algorithmic ban hammer if I cross any line.</p><p>An “official document to verify your identity” would presumably be a scan or photo of my passport. Now, I have reasonable confidence in the security of Google’s systems, but this is something very sensitive and can easily be abused if it fell into the wrong hands. And why is it necessary? I’ve done business with many other companies, where a lot more money was changing hands than I’m getting from my Play Store apps, but they never asked for my passport. Why does Google?</p><p>Those other companies also never asked for “an official document to verify your organization”. Presumably this is a document I can request from the Chamber of Commerce to the tune of another 9 €, but again I’ve never had another company ask for this when doing business with them.</p><h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2><p>I sort of understand why Google is doing all this. It’s partly legal requirements (especially EU), partly an attempt to reduce spam and malicious stuff. Some of it might even be in the best interest of the end user.</p><p>Larger companies have the resources to deal with all this, and for personal accounts the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13628312">rules</a> are much more lenient. Sadly, there has been little consideration for sole proprietorships like mine, which fall somewhere in between: bound by the same rules as big companies, but without the means to play by them.</p><p>And this is why I’m just going to let my Play Store developer account expire. Starting on 5 November, you won’t be able to install any of my apps anymore. Most of them were not actively maintained anymore, <em>but they still worked</em>, because the Android operating system itself is actually pretty good at backwards compatibility.</p><p>Even though there was little remaining interest in my older apps, it makes me sad that people won’t be able to use them anymore. The one I’m most sad about, though, is <a href="https://papageno.app/">Papageno</a>, an unfinished side project about bird sounds that I haven’t worked on for three years, but keeps popping into my mind as something I’d really like to finish some day. Maybe it could be in the form of a web app. We’ll see.</p><p><img src="https://frozenfractal.com/blog/2024/9/6/why-my-apps-will-soon-be-gone-from-google-play/no_more_google_play.png" alt="The official “Get it on Google Play” button, but with the text “You can no longer” scribbled above it, probably flying in the face of official brand guidelines"></p></div></div>]]></description>

I’ve gotten to a point where I can do this very consistently now, and I think others can learn this too.</p><p><span>There’s a misconception that good faith discussion only happens in close-knit communities like LessWrong or HackerNews. </span><strong>The reality I’m looking at here is that ~everyone on the internet is rational AND is arguing in good faith</strong><span>. If it doesn’t look that way, it’s because you’re speaking different languages.</span></p><p>Let’s look at 2 cases.</p><p><span>Here’s a puzzle: how do you respond to this insult to get them to apologize? </span><br><em>(I’ve blanked out the reply from user “InGoodFaith” for this exercise)</em></p><p>Some incorrect ways to respond:</p><ul><li><p>❌ Insulting them back </p><ul><li><p><em>(that just makes them more angry)</em></p></li></ul></li><li><p>❌ Telling them they’re wrong</p><ul><li><p><em> (they won’t understand what you’re saying because they’re already mad &amp; feeling attacked)</em></p></li><li><p><em>(even if they change their mind, they will not tell you this because it would feel like failure)</em></p></li></ul></li><li><p>❌ Telling them NOT to be rude </p><ul><li><p><em>(no one likes having their tone policied, they feel justified because (1) they are angry (2) your words are the source of their anger. Or at least their intrpretation of your words)</em></p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Here’s the winning move:</p><ul><li><p>✅ Signal that you are genuinely interested in understanding them, not attacking them</p></li></ul><p><span>No one has ever changed their mind while being attacked. People are way more likely to change their mind when they feel understood. </span><strong>It doesn’t matter if you understand them: you have to prove to *them* </strong><span>that you understand them</span><strong>.</strong></p><p>Yes, this is a lot of work. If you’re not willing to do this, then *you’re* not arguing in good faith in my book. You’re just here to beat people over the head with words that they don’t understand. It’s a waste of your time AND their time, and you leave with the (incorrect) belief that people are dumb, or don’t care about the truth etc. </p><p>This was the reply:</p><blockquote><p>sorry, I am too dumb to understand what "fortiori point" means! I think I'm just trying to understand the relationship of left/right towards Norway </p><p>I thought Norway = socialist policies = left-ist people aspire to it, but not republicans? right?</p></blockquote><p>The “too dumb” part I think helps to diffuse the anger, showing him that I’m not interested in fighting, but it’s probably not necessary. I think the important part was articulating what I don’t understand, asking a specific question. I’m also showing vulnerability by stating my beliefs and asking them to correct me. </p><p>This shows a genuine interest in understanding because it cannot be faked. It’s like “proof of work” in blockchain. It’s not enough to say:</p><blockquote><p>I really do want to understand you! Can you please explain your point without the insults?</p></blockquote><p>Because what the other person hears is:</p><blockquote><p><span>You’re not allowed to talk to me this way. Now repeat the point you’ve already said, but in a way that I will understand it. </span><strong>Also, I’m not going to bother telling you what part I didn’t understand</strong><span>, I want *you* to figure that out.</span></p></blockquote><p>I made an open call for anyone who feels like they encountered someone arguing “in bad faith” to send it to me and I will help analyze it/tell you what you could have done differently. </p><p>KJ took me up on it.</p><p>Here is the full interaction between them, and my analysis afterwards:</p><p>(1) 🪓“axial age” posts an anti-government post, in response to an obama quote</p><blockquote><p>Where did all those billions supposed to be spent on EV charging stations go? I patiently await your response.</p><p><em>Obama: "The other side knows it's easier to play on people's fears and cynicism. They will tell you that government is inherently corrupt."</em></p></blockquote><p>(2) 🎵 KJ responds</p><blockquote><p><span>looks like grants have been going out! and round 2 is coming up! </span><em>[link to source]</em></p><p><span>and not sure precisely the percentage that can be attributed to the CFI but there are certainly stations being built! </span><em>[link to source 2]</em></p><p>(i patiently await ur response 😛)</p></blockquote><p>(3) 🪓 axial responds</p><blockquote><p>How many built due to this program and at what cost? Press releases are cheap.</p></blockquote><p>(4) 🎵 KJ</p><blockquote><p>ok so actually, it looks like NONE have been built due to this program yet, bc the first round of funding was only just announced...</p><p>but the plan is to fund 47 projects (~7500 chargers) using 623mil of the total 2.5bil</p><p>(avg 80k per charger)</p></blockquote><p>(5) 🪓 axial </p><blockquote><p>this is why you're getting blocked</p></blockquote><p>From KJ’s prespective, this is bizarre: KJ was polite &amp; sincere, he included links to sources in every reply, he responded to every point axial brought it up. KJ is left with the conclusion that this person must not care at all about truth. </p><p>This is objectively the wrong conclusion. </p><p>Let’s look at this from axial’s side: </p><ol><li><p>He’s making a point about a strawman that Obama is using</p><ol><li><p>Obama says, vote blue, the other side is manipulating you into fearing the gov!</p></li><li><p>axial says, no, it’s not manipulation, it’s a valid criticism! </p></li></ol></li><li><p>Axial’s point is that it’s *not* about fear, it’s about, at best (1) government incompetence wasting tons of money (2) at worst, malicious actors getting rich off of these subsidies without actually providing value for society</p></li><li><p>KJ comes in with “proof” about the funding/plans for this money, and a smug, “patiently awaiting your response 😛”</p></li><li><p>This is totally missing the point. Axial very kindly explains:</p><ol><li><p>Yes, they’re saying they’re using this money for good, but how much good has it *actually* done?</p></li><li><p>And also, even if they did do these things, how much did it cost? Did it really need to cost this much? Could it have been done better &amp; cheaper if it was private? Is it possible that private companies are taking advantage of these gov programs and ripping us off?</p></li></ol></li><li><p>KJ doubles down: </p><ol><li><p>Insists that they’re going to build more, shares more links/press releases</p></li><li><p>Will not concede that there is a maybe a problem here, that maybe *some* government programs are not working, and that the rhetoric of the democratic party can sometimes strawman the other side</p></li></ol></li></ol><p>At this point axial blocks him because KJ comes off as NOT arguing in good faith, NOT interested in the truth. </p><p>KJ’s problem is he came in refuting a point that he didn’t understand. He was in fact arguing the wrong point. This is one of the most common failure modes I see. </p><p>The first step in any online argument is to understand the other side. You must empirically *confirm* this understanding with the other person. I would have said:</p><blockquote><p>“Where *did* those billions go? My understanding is a lot of it is going into building the initial infrastructure, so it’s slow going but we’ll see progress soon. Is that not true?” </p></blockquote><p>See, we don’t even know if axial is against EV and environmental protections, or if he just thinks the gov is doing a bad job executing it. How can you argue against this if you have no idea what he’s even saying? </p><p>So we start by (1) asking a question (2) articulating our understanding of the issue. The first point helps you understand them, the second point signals that you’re genuinely interested in understanding them, you’re laying your cards out. You’re revealing your beliefs and opening yourself up to being corrected.</p><p>It’s not about pretending that you’re willing to change your mind.

      <p>The underwater caves of the Yucatán Peninsula are a window to the distant past. Through two million years and over multiple glaciation cycles, these caves have been transformed. When the sea level was high, the caves flooded, and their reach expanded.</p>

<p>During the ice ages, the caves dried out as the sea level dropped, and the seeping water from the surface decorated the caverns with deposits such as stalagmites and stalactites, collectively known as <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/paleoclimatology/speleothem">speleothems</a>. Then, with the next cycle came higher sea levels again, flooding the caves and preserving in time the speleothems and everything else with them.</p>

<p>I have been diving the unique submerged landscapes of Mexican cenotes, or sinkholes, for almost ten years, exploring their dark, flooded tunnels and capturing their secrets. The last time the shallow caves on the Yucatán Peninsula flooded was around 8,000 years ago, which means that every diver in these caves travels back in time to a prehistoric age. The paleontological and archaeological remains preserved within them would disintegrate at the surface, which makes these caves a perfect time capsule.</p>

<h2>How Mexico’s cenotes came to be</h2>

<p>This underworld is formed by a massive underground aquifer in the northern Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. It is accessible by cenotes that connect the surface of the Earth to the longest underground river systems in the world. Here, water doesn’t accumulate on the surface as rivers, but instead gets absorbed through the porous limestone to flow within underground tunnels. Much as our blood vessels send life-sustaining fluid throughout our bodies, these tunnels convey the precious water that sustains all life in this region. It is no wonder that cenotes were considered sacred by the Maya.</p>

<p>The Maya established their civilization on the Yucatán Peninsula about 4,000 years ago. In order to thrive, they needed to settle close to a freshwater source. All of their largest settlements on the northern part of the peninsula—including the famed Chichén Itzá—were built beside cenotes. During the region’s dry season, cenotes were the only source of water; therefore, the sinkholes were not only a fundamental part of Maya life but also a place for worship and rituals related to rain, life, death and rebirth.</p>

<p>Each Maya <em>d’zonot </em>(the Maya word from which the word cenote comes from) was an entrance to the mystical underworld called Xibalba, where various deities and supernatural beings resided. It is a mysterious and powerful realm associated with death, a portal to a domain where ritualistic offerings honored both the gods and the deceased and sought protection and guidance for the living. Living within, and the protector of this underworld, was Chaac, the god of rain, fertility and agriculture. He was an important deity in Maya mythology, as rain was vital for the success of crops and the well-being of the community.</p>

<p>Beneath the cenotes, deeper in their caves, artifacts and human remains from the Maya civilization have lain undisturbed for centuries and can be seen by explorers. But these are not the only indicators of human presence. While the Maya settled the region only a few thousand years ago, evidence found in the cenotes points to human settlements in the area dating back more than 13,000 years. These finds challenge the accepted notion of when our ancestors first crossed into America via the Bering Land Bridge between Siberia and Alaska during the last ice age.</p>

<p>These ancient hunter-gatherers also depended on the cenotes as a water source, and probably for shelter as well. Back then, the cenotes were much drier, with the water level some 300 feet below current-day levels. The ancient inhabitants had to venture deep into the caves to access the water, crossing paths with huge prehistoric animals from the late Pleistocene—now long extinct—that also sought fresh water.</p>

<h2>Finding Maya artifacts and human remains</h2>

</figure>
<p>It’s challenging to put into words the raw and profound sensation that accompanies encountering a human skull in the darkness of the flooded caves. Long before I recognize a skull as mere remains, I can feel its gaze upon me from the shadows, a haunting presence that defies description. Particularly in the area of the Ring of Cenotes, many sacrificial cenotes hold skulls of the higher-ranking Maya families. Along with modified front teeth to host ornaments, these skulls were artificially deformed to create a physical distinction. The higher-ranking Maya used different techniques to shape their children’s skulls, creating an oblique deformation, which made their heads look longer than the average Maya’s. Said to resemble a jaguar’s head, this shape was a symbol of power. Also rare sightings for cave explorers are sophisticated Maya paintings on cave walls close to the entrances of cenotes. Depicting wars, animals, gods and stories, these treasures can be forever lost once submerged, washed away over time.</p>

<p>Long before the Maya settled in the area, the first Homo sapiens crossed into America over the Bering Land Bridge at least 25,000 years ago. They made their way down to South America and arrived on the Yucatán Peninsula at the end of the last ice age around 13,000 years ago. There they used the caves to extract water and minerals, to find shelter, and to bury their dead. While it is typically hard to find remains of these hunter-gatherers on the surface of the Earth, evidence of early human presence was preserved in these caves from before the last time the caves flooded. That evidence gives us clues to understanding early humans’ biology and even their social interactions.</p>

<p>Within the flooded caves it is common to see purposely broken formations that create passages through the tunnels, and even cairns—made of piles of rocks or broken speleothems—placed at the junctions of tunnels to navigate the intricate cave labyrinths. Early humans also excavated rocks and mined red ocher using only Stone Age tools and their mastery of fire. They used the ocher to decorate objects for personal ornamentation and burials. They also decorated the caves with multiple art forms, from paintings on the walls to sculptures. A well-known example is the figure of a woman at the entrance of Cenote Dos Ojos; while it was not sculpted as such, it is a carefully selected speleothem that resembles the silhouette of a woman and was intentionally exhibited on a pedestal to decorate the cave entrance, evidence of paleoart from more than 8,000 years ago that anyone can visit.</p>

<h2>Diving for fossil evidence of extinct megafauna</h2>

<p>As if they were corridors of a museum, the submerged passageways of these time capsules also offer divers the opportunity to uncover exquisitely preserved fossils of diverse creatures—most of which are now extinct—that once inhabited the Yucatán during the late Pleistocene.</p>

<p>Following the cataclysmic impact of the Chicxulub asteroid 66 million years ago, which marked the end of the dinosaur age, mammals began to dominate the lands once ruled by dinosaurs. Over time, North and South America underwent distinct evolutionary trajectories. However, around 2.7 million years ago, the formation of the Panamanian land bridge facilitated a pivotal event: the Great American Biotic Interchange.</p>

<p>During this exchange, North American fauna migrated southward, including large mammals called megafauna, like saber-toothed cats, lions, gomphotheres (related to modern elephants), horses and camels. Meanwhile, South American megafauna moved northward, including giant ground sloths and glyptodonts (enormous armadillos). This monumental event significantly influenced and sculpted the ecosystems and biodiversity of both continents, affecting the composition of species and ecosystems we see today.</p>

<p>The thrill of exploring the underwater caves of the Yucatán is heightened upon uncovering the fossilized remains of these long-extinct megafauna. Visualizing these colossal creatures coming to life right where you are diving, in what was once a prehistoric cave that had been frozen in time by these waters, is like being teleported back to their era, immersed in a thrilling journey through time. How their fossils came to be submerged underwater can be easily imagined. With the water level during the last ice age up to 300 feet lower than it is today, these animals had to venture down dark, dry cave passages to reach drinking water, sometimes surprisingly far away from an entrance. Trapped in sinkholes or lost within labyrinthine passages, these animals died, and their remains became fossilized and preserved by rising water levels.</p>

<p>Among the many extinct species that lived in this region are members of the family Megalonychidae (including the genus <em>Megalonyx</em>, Greek for “large claw”). Fossils of these giant ground sloths are commonly found in the caves, as they probably took refuge within them, such as members of the genus <em>Xibalbaonyx</em> (“great claw of Xibalba”), a polar bear-sized ground sloth with big claws that measured up to 12 feet in height and weighed nearly a ton. They are joined by members of related families, including the genus <em>Nothrotheriops</em>, a grizzly bear-sized mammal that reached five feet tall and weighed 1,000 pounds.</p>

<p>Representing archaeological and paleontological marvels, the fossils concealed within the caves constitute genuine treasures, allowing for teams of specialized scientists to explore these wonders, aiming to unravel scientific enigmas, construct hypotheses and shed light on the mysteries that shroud our planet’s history.</p>

<h2>Many more mysteries to be solved</h2>

<p>There’s a symbiotic relationship between the passionate and technical cave explorers who investigate every hole in a cave in their free time (and just for fun) and those in the scientific community who want to study these prehistoric materials but cannot reach where they’re hidden in the underwater darkness. This relationship of discovery and research has already provided evidence of many newly discovered extinct species, as well as ancient humans who had vanished for millennia, a relationship that could be fostered even more by leveraging the world-class level of the dive explorers in the area. After all, the majority of these secrets remain yet to be discovered!</p>

<p>The caves also hold evidence that could solve a prehistoric murder mystery. After the Great American Biotic Interchange, these megafauna species coexisted in this region for hundreds of thousands of years and through multiple ice age cycles, until their abrupt extinction more than 10,000 years ago when a new species arrived on the Yucatán Peninsula: Homo sapiens.</p>

<p>After humans arrived in the region, many genera of large mammals became extinct. There are different ways to explain this mass extinction event. One leading hypothesis states that the already reduced populations of those animals, stressed due to the changing climate after the latest ice age, were hunted to extinction by the humans. These big mammals, which needed a long time to become sexually mature and had slow reproduction rates (up to 22 months), were particularly vulnerable to this new threat.</p>

<p>Among the fossils preserved within the flooded caves, I have witnessed many examples indicating that these extinct species had been hunted and eaten by our predecessors, such as preserved megafauna bones exhibiting cut marks from human-made stone tools, the repetitive marks showing the methodical action taken to remove flesh from the bone. Also noted are perforations on fossilized bones inflicted by projectiles, extinct animal remains beside cooking pits with bones in them, organized piles of bones, and burn marks on animal fossils inside the cave. Indications such as these have been found at cave depths that correspond to the time horizon when humans and the now-extinct animals coexisted and within areas that also exhibit indications of the kind of sophisticated social organization required for early humans to hunt these big creatures, like the mining of red ocher.</p>

<p>The hypothesis of the Paleo-Americans overhunting these species to extinction still needs to be validated, but it is undeniable that these caves protect invaluable material for scientists to study, information that will help us understand our past—and hopefully inform our future.</p>

</p>

<p>
<a href="https://justine.lol/cosmo3/">Cosmopolitan Libc</a> is well-known for
its <a href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">polyglot fat binary</a> hack
that lets your executables run on six OSes for AMD64 / ARM64. What may
surprise you is that it could also be the best C library for your
production workloads too. To demonstrate this point, let's compare
Cosmo's mutex library with other platforms.

</p><p>
We'll do this by writing a simple test that spawns <strong>30
threads</strong> which increment the same integer <strong>100,000
times</strong>. This tests how well a mutex implementation performs in
the heavily contended use case. In essence, that means the following
(see the segment at the bottom of the page for the full source code).

</p><pre><span>int</span> g_chores;
<span>pthread_mutex_t</span> g_locker = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

<span>void</span> *<span>worker</span>(<span>void</span> *arg) {
  <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = 0; i &lt; ITERATIONS; ++i) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;g_locker);
    ++g_chores;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;g_locker);
  }
  <span>return</span> 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
Now let's start with the exciting part, which are my benchmark results.

</p><h3>Benchmarks</h3>

<p>
Times will be measured in microseconds. Wall time is how long the test
program takes to run. That includes the overhead of spawning and joining
threads. User time is how much CPU time was spent in userspace, and
system time is how much CPU time was spent in the kernel. System and
user time can exceed the actual wall time because multiple threads are
running in parallel.

</p><p>
The first results I'll show are for Windows because Mark Waterman did an
excellent <a href="https://github.com/markwaterman/MutexShootout">mutex
shootout</a> three months ago, where he said, "in the highly contended
scenario, Windows wins the day with its SRWLOCK". Contention is where
mutex implementations show their inequality. Mark was so impressed by
Microsoft's SRWLOCK that he went on to recommend Linux and FreeBSD users
consider targeting Windows if mutex contention is an issue.

<p>
As we can see, Cosmopolitan Libc mutexes go 2.75x faster than
Microsoft's SRWLOCK (which was previously believed to be the best of the
best) while consuming 18x fewer CPU resources. Cosmopolitan mutexes were
also 65x faster than Cygwin, which like Cosmopolitan provides a POSIX
implementation on Windows. Cygwin's mutexes are so bad that they would
have been better off for this use case just using a spin lock.

Now onto Linux, the lord of all operating systems.

</div>

<p>
  Here we see Cosmopolitan mutexes are:

</p><ul>
<li>3x faster than glibc
</li><li>11x faster than glibc
</li><li>42x less CPU time than glibc
</li><li>178x less CPU time than Musl Libc
</li></ul>

<p>
Here's how things actually work in practice. Imagine you have a workload
where all your threads need to do a serialized operation. With Cosmo, if
you're looking at htop, then it's going to appear like only one core is
active, whereas glibc and musl libc will fill up your entire CPU meter.
That's bad news if you're running a lot of jobs on the same server. If
just one of your servers has a mutex bloodbath, then all your resources
are gone, unless you're using cosmo. It's still a new C library and it's
a little rough around the edges. But it's getting so good, so fast, that
I'm starting to view <em>not</em> using it in production as an
abandonment of professional responsibility. The C library is so deeply
embedded in the software supply chain, and so depended upon, that you
really don't want it to be a planet killer. If essential unquestioned
tools are this wasteful then it's no wonder Amazon Cloud makes such a
fortune.

</p><p>
Last but not least, we have MacOS.

<p>
On MacOS with an M2 ARM64 microprocessor, Apple's Libc slightly
outperforms Cosmopolitan's mutexes. For reasons I do not yet fully
understand, Cosmopolitan's normal mutex implementation doesn't work well
on this platform. It's possibly because the M2 and XNU are in league. So
on MacOS ARM, Cosmopolitan uses a simpler algorithm based on Ulrich
Drepper's
"<a href="https://dept-info.labri.fr/~denis/Enseignement/2008-IR/Articles/01-futex.pdf">Futexes
Are Tricky</a>" paper that basically just farms out all the heavy
lifting to XNU's ulock system calls. That's why performance is nearly
identical to what Apple does.

</p><p>
So in summary, these benchmark results indicate that Cosmopolitan
mutexes, in the best case, will be overwhelmingly better than
alternatives at the contended + tiny critical section use case, and in
the worst case, Cosmopolitan will be roughly as good.

</p><h3>How I Did It</h3>

<p>
The reason why Cosmopolitan Mutexes are so good is because I used a
library called <a href="https://github.com/google/nsync">nsync</a>. It
only has 371 stars on GitHub, but it was written by a distinguished
engineer at Google named Mike Burrows. If you don't know who he is, he's
the guy who coded Google's fiercest competitor, which was Altavista. If
you're not old enough to remember Altavista, it was the first search
engine that was good, and it ran on a single computer.

</p><p>
I've had a lot of fun integrating nsync into Cosmopolitan. I've even
had the opportunity to make upstream contributions. For example, I found
and fixed a bug in his mutex unlock function that had gone undiscovered
for years. I also managed to make contended nsync mutexes go 30% faster
than nsync upstream on AARCH64, by porting it to use C11 atomics. I
wrote new system integration for things like futexes that enable it do
portability at runtime. Lastly I made it work seamlessly with POSIX
thread cancelations.

</p><p>
So how does nsync do it? What are the tricks that it uses? Here's some
of my takes and analysis:

</p><ul>

<li>
nsync uses an optimistic CAS (compare and swap) immediately, so that
locking happens quickly when there's no contention.

</li><li>
When a lock can't be acquired, nsync adds the calling thread to a
doubly linked list of waiters. Each waiter gets its own semaphore on a
separate independent cacheline. This serves an important purpose. Once a
thread enters the wait state, it's no longer touching the main lock. To
understand why that's important, read Ulrich Drepper's paper
"<a href="https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf">What
Every Programmer Should Know About Memory</a>". He goes into great depth
on the coherency protocols used by modern microprocessors, where cores
basically talk to each other under the hood about which cachelines
they're using. When multiple cores touch the same ones, that creates a
lot of communication overhead within the processor.

</li><li>
nsync enlists the help of the operating system by using futexes. This is
a great abstraction invented by Linux some years ago, that quickly found
its way into other OSes. On MacOS, futexes are called ulock. On Windows,
futexes are called <code>WaitOnAddress()</code>. The only OS Cosmo
supports that doesn't have futexes is NetBSD, which implements POSIX
semaphores in kernelspace, and each semaphore sadly requires creating a
new file descriptor. But the important thing about futexes and
semaphores is they allow the OS to put a thread to sleep. That's what
lets nsync avoid consuming CPU time when there's nothing to do.

</li><li>
nsync avoids starvation with this concept of a "long wait". If a waiter
gets woken 30 times and fails to acquire the lock internally every time,
then nsync adds a bit to the lock that prevents threads that haven't
waited yet from acquiring. This means that initial CAS at the beginning
will fail for everyone else until the queue has had some time to clear.

</li><li>
nsync makes the use case we benchmarked go fast (contended lock with a
small critical section) using this concept of a "designated waker". This
bit on the main lock is set when a thread is awake and trying to acquire
the lock. In nsync, the unlock function is what's responsible for waking
the next thread in line waiting for the lock. Having this bit allows the
unlocking thread to know it needn't bother waking a second locker since
one is already awake.

</li></ul>

<p>
To learn more of nsync's secrets, you can read the source code here:
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/tree/master/third_party/nsync/mu.c"><code>cosmopolitan/third_party/nsync/mu.c</code></a>.

</p><h3>Online Proof</h3>

<p>
If you want to see a live demo of a piece of software built with Cosmo
mutexes, then do your worst DDOS to the
<a href="http://ipv4.games/">http://ipv4.games/</a> web server. Now this
is truly a game for hackers, competing to dominate the Internet. You're
already playing this game because your IP was just claimed for jart. The
service runs on a GCE VM with 2 cores and so far it's managed to survive
being DDOS'd by botnets as large as 49,131,669 IPs. A lot of that is
thanks to nsync which allowed me to move SQL queries to background
threads which send messages to each other. There are still improvements
to be made, but overall it's held up well. You can even monitor
its <a href="http://ipv4.games/statusz">/statusz</a> health metrics.

</pre>

<p>
The reason we care about the contended case, because that's where mutex
implementations show their inequality. Uncontended mutexes usually
perform the same across implementations, and even then you might be
better off with a spin lock, which only takes a few lines:

</p><pre><span>void</span> <span>spin_lock</span>(<span>atomic_int</span> *lock) {
  if (atomic_exchange_explicit(lock, 1, memory_order_acquire)) {
    <span>for</span> (;;) {
      <span>for</span> (;;)
        <span>if</span> (!atomic_load_explicit(lock, memory_order_relaxed))
          <span>break</span>;
      <span>if</span> (!atomic_exchange_explicit(lock, 1, memory_order_acquire))
        <span>break</span>;
    }
  }
}

<span>void</span> <span>spin_unlock</span>(<span>atomic_int</span> *lock) {
  atomic_store_explicit(lock, 0, memory_order_release);
}
</pre>

<p>
Please note that spin locks should really only be used when you have no
other choice. They're useful in kernels, where extreme low level
constraints disallow anything fancy. Spin locks are also a useful
implementation detail in nsync locks. But overall they're bad. I imagine
many developers believe they're good. If so, it's probably because
they've only benchmarked wall time. With locks, it's important to take
CPU time into consideration too. That's why we use
<code>getrusage()</code>.

<p>What follows is an unusual story of perseverance. We start with a conjecture and after some plot twists  end up discussing the meaning of truth. While the title is a spoiler, you might not be able to guess how we got there…</p>



<h4>The conjecture</h4>



<p>The <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunkbed_conjecture">bunkbed conjecture</a></em></strong> (BBC) is a basic claim about random subgraphs. Start with a finite graph <em><strong>G</strong></em><strong>=(<em>V</em>,<em>E</em>)</strong> and consider a product graph <strong><em>G</em> <em>x</em> <em>K</em><sub>2</sub></strong> obtained by connecting the corresponding vertices on levels <strong><em>V</em><sup>(1)</sup></strong> and <strong><em>V</em><sup>(2)</sup></strong>.  Sort of like a <a href="https://i.etsystatic.com/22453533/r/il/81fe4f/3189746867/il_1588xN.3189746867_dodu.jpg">bunkbed</a>.  Now consider random subgraphs of a this product graph.  </p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><mark>Bunkbed Conjecture:</mark></strong>  The probability that vertices <em><strong>u</strong></em><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup> and <em><strong>v</strong></em><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup> are connected is greater or equal than the probability that vertices <em><strong>u</strong></em><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup> and <strong><em>v</em></strong><sup><strong>(2)</strong></sup> are connected.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In other words, the probability of connecting two vertices on the same level cannot be smaller than when connect vertices on different levels. This is completely obvious, of course! And yet the conjecture this problem defeated several generations of probabilists and remained open until now. For a good reason, of course. It was <em><a href="https://as1.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/04/87/13/32/1000_F_487133220_dPDd98wC3pFZcHxs4wfEnZYDAO4wDqLd.jpg">false</a></em>!</p>



<p>The origins of the conjecture are murky, but according to <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2652916">van den Berg and Kahn</a> it was conjectured by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Kasteleyn">Kasteleyn </a>in the early 1980s. There are many versions of this conjecture; notably one can condition on the subset of vertical edges and ask the same question. Many partial results are known, as well as results for other probabilistic models. The conjecture is <em><strong><mark>false</mark></strong></em> nonetheless!</p>



<h4>The direction</h4>



<p>Why look for a counterexample if the conjecture is so obviously true?  Well, because you always should.  For any conjecture.  Especially if everyone else is so <em><strong>sure</strong></em>, as in <em>completely absolutely sure without a doubt</em>, that the conjecture is true.  <strong><em><mark>What if they are all wrong?</mark></em></strong>  I discuss this at length in <a href="https://wp.me/p211iQ-uT">this blog post</a>, so there is no need to rehash this point.  </p>



<h4>The counterexample</h4>



<p>We disprove the conjecture in a<strong> <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/papers/BunkBed4.pdf">joint paper</a></strong> with <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~gladkovna/">Nikita Gladkov</a> (UCLA) and <a href="https://web.mit.edu/azimin/www/">Alexandr Zimin</a> (MIT), both graduate students.  Roughly speaking we take the following 3-hypergraph from a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01790">recent paper</a> by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PabtgaQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Hollom</a>.  </p>

<p>We then replace each yellow triangle with the following gadget using <em>n</em>=1204, placing <em>a</em> in the shaded vertex, while <em><strong>v</strong></em><sub><strong>1</strong></sub> and <em><strong>v</strong></em><sub><strong>n</strong></sub> are placed in the other vertices of the triangle (so the red path goes into the red path).  For a stronger version of the conjecture that’s all there is.  For a weaker version, some additional tweaks needed to be made (they are not so important).  And we are done!  </p>

<p>The resulting graph is has 7523 vertices and 15654 edges.   The difference between probabilities for paths between <strong><em>u</em><sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><em>u</em><sub>10</sub></strong> at the same and different levels as in the conjecture is astronomically small, on the order of -10<sup>-6500</sup>.  But it’s negative, which is all we need.  Very very roughly speaking, the red path is the only path which avoids shaded vertices and creates a certain bias which give this probability gap.  Formalizing this is a bit technical.  </p>



<h4>The experiments</h4>



<p>Of course, the obvious way to verify our counterexample computationally would fail miserably — the graph is much too large.  Instead, we give a relatively elementary completely combinatorial disproof of the BBC that is accessible to a wide audience.  I would rather not rehash technical details and ideas in the proof — it’s all in <strong><a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/papers/BunkBed4.pdf">our paper</a></strong>, which is only 12 pages!   See also the <a href="https://github.com/Kroneckera/bunkbed-counterexample">GitHub code</a> and some <a href="https://web.mit.edu/azimin/www/notebooks/bunkbed_counterexample.html">explanation</a>. </p>



<p>I do want to mention that giving formal disproof was not our first choice.  It’s what we ended up doing after many failures.  There is always a bit of a stigma people have about publicly discussing their failures.  I know very few examples, only <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/549797884/How-Not-to-Prove-Poincare-Conjecture">this one</a> famous enough to be mentioned.   So let me mention briefly how we failed.  </p>



<p>Since I was sure the bunkbed conjecture is false (for reasons somewhat different from my contrarian philosophy), we started with a myriad of computer experiments trying all small graphs.  When those failed, we tried to use AI and other computer assisted tools.  We burned many hours on a giant <em><a href="https://www.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/">UCLA Hoffman2 Cluster</a></em> getting closer for a while.  In hindsight, we didn’t look in the right place, obviously.  After several months of computer experiments and no clear counterexample, it felt we are wasting time.  We then thought a bit more about philosophy of what we are doing and stopped.  </p>



<p>Before I tell you why we stopped, let me make a <strong>general recommendation</strong>.  Please do try computer experiments for whatever you are working on.  Make an effort to think it through and design a good experiment.  Work hard to test as much as your computer technology allows.  If you need some computing power, ask around.  Your university might just have the resources.  Occasionally, you can even <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/120867366">ask a private company</a> to donate theirs.  </p>



<p>If you succeed, write a paper and publish it.  Make your code and work notes publicly available.  If you fail, do exactly the same.  If the journals refuse to publish your paper, just keep it on the arXiv.  Other people in your area would want to know.  And as far as the NSF is concerned, all of this is “work product”.  You can’t change the nature of the problem and the results you are getting, but you deserve the credit regardless.  </p>



<p><strong>Let me repeat:</strong> Do not fear telling other you have not succeeded in your computer testing.  Fear others making the same mistakes or repeating the same work that you did.</p>



<h4>The curse</h4>



<p>One reason we stopped is because in our initial rush to testing we failed to contemplate the implications of Monte Carlo testing of even moderately large graphs.  Here is a quote from the paper:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Suppose we did find a potential counterexample graph with only <em>m</em>=100 edges and the probability gap was large enough to be statistically detectable. Since analyzing all of 2<sup>m</sup> ≈ 10<sup>30</sup> subgraphs is not feasible, our Monte Carlo simulations could only confirm the desired inequality with high probability. While this probability could be amplified by repeated testing, one could never formally disprove the bunkbed conjecture this way, of course. </p>



<p><br>This raises somewhat uncomfortable questions whether the mathematical community is ready to live with an uncertainty over validity of formal claims that are only known with high probability. It is also unclear whether in this imaginary world the granting agencies would be willing to support costly computational projects to further increase such probabilities (cf. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03543">Garrabrant+’16</a>], [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9301202">Zeilberger’93</a>]). Fortunately, our failed computational effort avoided this dystopian reality, and we were able to disprove the bunkbed conjecture by a formal argument.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Societal implications aside, it is an interesting question whether a reputable math journal <em>should </em>accept a counterexample that is tested with 99.99% confidence, and the results can be replicated and rechecked by others.  Five sigma may be a <a href="https://home.cern/resources/faqs/five-sigma">gold standard</a> in nuclear physics, but math journals tend to prefer 100% correctness (even though <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/02/13/journal-retracts-paper-state-senator-former-mathematician/">some papers</a> they publish are 100% incorrect).  </p>



<p>What I <em>do know</em>, is that most journals would refuse to even <em>consider</em> a “five sigma counterexample”.  While details of the situations differ quite a bit, I knew <a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/Opinion121.html">what happened</a> to the (rather interesting) Sills–Zeilberger paper, which was <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10236198.2012.678837">eventually published</a>, but not after several desk rejections.  But PhD students need jobs in reality, not in theory.  That is really why we stopped.  Why persevere and create controversy when you can just try doing something else?  </p>



<p><strong>P.S.</strong> There is yet another layer to all of this. Back in 1999, I asked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Wigderson">Avi Wigderson</a> if <strong>P=BPP</strong>? He said “<em>Yes</em>“. Last week I asked him again. This is 25 years later, almost to the day. He said “<em>Yes, I am absolutely sure of that</em>.” It’s one of his <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-turing-award-winner-everything-is-computation-and-some-problems-are-unsolvable/">favorite conjectures</a>, of course. If he is right, every probabilistic counterexample can be turned into deterministic. In other words, there would be a fully rigorous way to estimate both probabilities and prove on a computer that the conjecture is false. But you must have guessed what I was thinking when I heard what he said — now he used “<em>absolutely sure</em>“…</p>
