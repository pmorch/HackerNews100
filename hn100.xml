<p>Is it insider trading if I bought Boeing puts while I am inside the
wrecked airplane?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>Insider information is information obtained from an "insider" such as an executive or director of the company, or perhaps someone subject to a non-disclosure agreement with the company. Engaging in stock trading based upon confidential information from an insider source, before it is publicly disclosed, is illegal in most cases. <em>See, e.g.</em>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1164964/000101968715004168/globalfuture_8k-ex9904.htm" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insider_trading" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. From the first link:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SEC Rule 10b-5 prohibits corporate officers and directors or other
insider employees from using confidential corporate information to
reap a profit (or avoid a loss) by trading in the Company’s stock.
This rule also prohibits “tipping” of confidential corporate
information to third parties.</p>
<p>· Who is an insider?</p>
<p>An “insider” is an officer, director, 10%
stockholder and anyone who possesses inside information because of his
or her relationship with the Company or with an officer, director or
principal stockholder of the Company. Rule 10b-5’s application goes
considerably beyond just officers, directors and principal
stockholders. This rule also covers any employee who has obtained
material non-public corporate information, as well as any person who
has received a “tip” from an Insider of the Company concerning
information about the Company that is material and nonpublic, and
trades (i.e. purchase or sells) the Company’s stock or other
securities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you are not personally an insider, and you are relying on your own personal knowledge, you are not relying on knowledge from an "insider", so you are not engaged in insider trading.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that Boeing is an aircraft manufacturer, not an airline. So, no one employed by the airline flying the plane would be an insider with respect to Boeing.</p>

The future here is something to look forward to: going to city centers purely to do something alone you can do anywhere makes no logical sense. This was all inevitable and good, unless you wanted humans to remain enslaved and great real estate locations to be stuck in 1950s-era industrial economy use.</p><p><span>Even the old guard suits at Goldman Sachs believe remote is here to stay [</span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/01/16/ceo-return-to-office-wars" rel="">via Axios</a><span>]:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Remote work appears likely to be the most persistent economic legacy of the pandemic," write Goldman Sachs economists in a recent note.</em></p><p><em>About 20%-25% of workers in the U.S. work from home at least part of the week, according to data Goldman cites. That's below a peak of 47% during the pandemic but well above its prior average of around 3%.</em></p><p><em><strong>"The battle is over,</strong><span>" said Diana Scott, human capital center leader at The Conference Board. "There are so many other issues CEOs are facing.”</span></em></p></blockquote><p><span>Now that remote has been normalized for some time it was cool to also see some </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4675401" rel="">new research</a><span> on public firms and distributed work just published December, 2023. The full paper is worth reading, but the summary is what you would expect if you’re paying attention and viewing this issue objectively (emphasis mine).</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Using a sample of Standard and Poor’s 500 firms, we examine determinants and consequences of U.S. firms’ return-to-office (RTO) mandates. Results of our determinant analyses are consistent with managers using RTO mandates to reassert control over employees and blame employees as a scapegoat for bad firm performance. </em></p><p><em><span>…our findings do not support the argument that managers impose mandates because they believe RTO increases firm values. Further, </span><strong>our difference in differences tests report significant declines in employees’ job satisfactions mandates but no significant changes in financial performance or firm values after RTO mandates.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>So basically, TL;DR: you will make your employees hate their lives, make less money and be less efficient by electing to assert authoritarian control over their movements and do the same work in a different arbitrary building every day. And I am not being hyperbolic here, I have heard stories from friends in legacy sectors whose teams have started location-tracking employees during the day. It’s straight out of a dystopian panopticon science fiction novel. I can’t imagine anyone competent staying at such firms very long.</p><p><span>Absolute top companies like like NVIDIA worth well &gt;$1 trillion are running remote operations for their teams, so there’s really no excuse that “this is just for smaller shops.” My team at Google was distributed many years before this was normalized and we worked on software at internet scale. So when execs comment here, they’re simply putting their lack of (modern) management skills on display for the world to see.

This happened across America, and because of such public tantrums no one feels bad for them. </span></p><p><strong>Where we go from here…</strong></p><p>Daily commutes into an office are simply not coming back for competent people. Everyone I talk to who loves their craft would rather simply not work than go back to wasting their lives in traffic (and this is how we designed America). They would rather have that time purely for working, which they can now do. The analogy to best understand this which I’ve said before is like believing in Santa Claus as a child, and later discovering Santa isn’t real. You can’t go back. The spell of the office being a requisite for modern work was broken. The genie is impossible to put back in the bottle. Everyone will adapt.</p><p><span>So all we have left are bad bosses, CRE bagholders who want everyone to be miserable in order to prop up their portfolios, and some % of mid-managers who simply hate their lives and want their peers to sit in traffic for 2 hours a day (</span><a href="https://www.hottakes.space/p/ditching-your-commute-worth-40kyear" rel="">literally </a><em><a href="https://www.hottakes.space/p/ditching-your-commute-worth-40kyear" rel="">the</a></em><a href="https://www.hottakes.space/p/ditching-your-commute-worth-40kyear" rel=""> cause of unhappiness</a><span> in modernity).

Sane people will continue to point out the absurdity and hypocrisy. And for investors, employees or even just customers: remember any company doing “RTO” is a giant red flag they don't know what they're doing, are lying to the market, or hate their own employees. It’s really just layoffs by another name, because they can’t simply be honest.</p><p>In summary: remote work won, don’t let anyone gaslight you to believe otherwise.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">This floor is made up of a bunch of tiles that all work to keep people in the center of them.</h2></div><section><p>Alongside announcing that Lanny Smoot will be the first Disney employee besides Walt to be inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, Disney also shared one of his newest projects called the HoloTile floor, which just may be a game changer for VR and could bring us ever closer to experiencing the Holodeck from Star Trek.</p><p>Disney shared the news and <a href="https://youtu.be/68YMEmaF0rs?si=NJuK14JuvqIKzsa0&amp;t=182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a video of the HoloTile floor in action</a> in <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/lanny-smoot-to-be-the-first-disney-imagineer-inducted-into-the-national-inventors-hall-of-fame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog celebrating Smoot,</a> who holds over 100 patents and secured 74 of those during his 25 years at The Walt Disney Company.</p><p>As for the HoloTile floor itself, it is described by Disney as the "world’s first multi-person, omni-directional, modular, expandable, treadmill floor." You have to think of it like a floor made of many tiles that do all they can to keep people or objects in the center of them. This could allow people to "have a shared virtual reality (VR) experience, walk an unlimited distance in any direction, and never collide or walk off its surface."</p><p>Many of us have experienced the joy that can be a really stellar VR experience, but there are always certain limitations to the immersion that comes with it. While it's great to be able to visit The Black Spire Outpost on the planet of Batuu in Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge in VR, you also run the risk of being pulled back to Earth when you bump into your couch and can only move a few feet here and there.</p><p>With the HoloTile floor, Disney appears to be envisioning a future where those limitations are no more and we can explore wide environments and feel that we are actually walking or running through them despite us staying mostly in one place. For those Star Trek fans out there, this sounds a lot like the promise of the Holodeck, a smallish-room that could virtually take our favorite crews wherever they wanted for some fun and relaxation between missions when it wasn't malfunctioning and trying to murder them. </p><p>The HoloTile floor can do more than just let people walk on it, as it can also move objects around. <a href="https://youtu.be/68YMEmaF0rs?si=ntNM2LGdnNktkZQE&amp;t=257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In the video,</a> we see an object being moved around the floor and an arm extending at the corner of the screen, as if they were using the Force to move an object. Yes, the possibilities of this are making a Star Wars fan like myself VERY happy. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/23/floor-1706037202625.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" alt="Lanny Smoot on the HoloTile Floor.

Image Credit: The Walt Disney Company</figcaption></figure></output><p>The applications of the HoloTile floor also extend beyond virtual reality, as Disney notes "The HoloTile floor can also be an insert in a theatrical stage, allowing performers to move and dance in new ways, or stage props and structures to move around or appear to set themselves up."</p><p>However, it's important not to get too excited yet as Smoot notes "we don't know yet where that will be used." So, while we may have to wait a while to see what this tech could become, its an exciting glimpse into the future that could hopefully one day change how we experience our favorite universes in Disney Parks, our homes, and beyond.</p><p><em>Adam Bankhurst is a news writer for IGN.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Conspiracy theorists working for and within the US government are perpetuating myths about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ufos" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">UFOs</a> that millions of taxpayer dollars are then spent looking into, a “self-licking ice cream cone”, according to the Pentagon’s former chief investigator of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP).</p><p>Sean Kirkpatrick made the claim in a podcast this week after stepping down last month as the first director of the defense department’s <a href="https://www.aaro.mil/" data-link-name="in body link">all-domain anomaly resolution office</a> (Aaro). It was set up in 2022 to collate military reports of UAP sightings and to be more transparent about what the government knows.</p><figure id="d1ef49b4-37af-4ba5-8312-51bddaeed1c8" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:2,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;US Congress passes stripped-down measure to release UFO records&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;d1ef49b4-37af-4ba5-8312-51bddaeed1c8&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/15/ufo-records-release-congress&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false}"></gu-island></figure><p>Aaro’s first comprehensive historical record report, which has been submitted to Congress and is set for publication later this year, contains no evidence of the existence of alien life, or any government cover-up, Kirkpatrick says.</p><p>But many lawmakers, he insists, are only too happy to embrace unsubstantiated stories circulated by “a core group of people” about secret government UFO research programs. Those include <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/06/whistleblower-ufo-alien-tech-spacecraft" data-link-name="in body link">startling claims</a> from the former US intelligence official and whistleblower David Grusch last year about intact alien vehicles and non-human “biologics”, or biological matter, stored at a remote facility.</p><p>“They’re some of the same people that have been working behind the scenes with Congress to write legislation,” Kirkpatrick told the <a href="https://www.peterbergen.com/podcast/#episode38" data-link-name="in body link">In the Room With Peter Bergen</a> podcast.</p><p>“They’re the same people that worked with a US company and the US army to explore a piece of material that they claim was a UAP and really is a piece of missile casing from the 1950s. They’re the same people that have been influencing some of these whistleblowers who have come forward to say: ‘Hey, I don’t have any first-hand evidence, but all these people are telling me this.’”</p><p>Kirkpatrick declined to identify the people by name, but agreed with Bergen’s observation that “the actual conspiracy is being carried out by a group of true believers themselves to get the government involved in the business of investigating aliens”.</p><p>“That is a self-licking ice cream cone, exactly,” Kirkpatrick said. “The best thing that could have happened in this job is I found the aliens, and I could have rolled them out, but there’s none. There is no evidence of extraterrestrials. There is no evidence of aliens, and there’s no evidence of the government conspiracy.”</p><p>Kirkpatrick said in a resignation essay <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/heres-what-i-learned-as-the-u-s-governments-ufo-hunter/" data-link-name="in body link">published by Scientific American</a> last week that he feared lawmakers had succumbed to “conspiracy-driven decision-making” and sensationalism in their rush to “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jul/26/ufo-hearing-congress-david-grusch-whistleblower-live-updates?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with:block-64c12aaa8f0890ba7a1f7a9f#block-64c12aaa8f0890ba7a1f7a9f" data-link-name="in body link">uncover the cover-up</a>”.</p><p>“Worrisome is the willingness of some to make judgments and take actions on these stories without having seen or even requested supporting evidence, an omission that is all the more problematic when the claims are so extraordinary,” he wrote.</p><p>“Some members of Congress prefer to <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?529468-1/republican-oversight-committee-members-upcoming-unidentified-aerial-phenomena" data-link-name="in body link">opine about aliens to the press</a> rather than get an evidence-based briefing on the matter. Members have a responsibility to exhibit critical-thinking skills instead of seeking the spotlight.”</p><p>His frustration was apparent in his conversation with Bergen. He said his department’s mission to use a “rigorous scientific framework and a data-driven approach” to collate and evaluate UFO reports and sightings going back decades had been hampered by misrepresentations, half-truths and other snippets of misinformation from unreliable sources.</p><p>“You’ve got people that talk to people who come in to tell the story, or tell the media, and other people come in, but it turns out none of them have any first-hand evidence or knowledge,” Kirkpatrick said.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-14">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-14" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>“They’re all relaying stories that they’ve heard from other people. And if you track where all those people know each other, it all goes back to the same core group of people.”</p><p>What his team was able to deduce, Kirkpatrick said, was that at least 90% of recorded UFO sightings, including some videos of military encounters <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/pentagon-releases-three-ufo-videos-taken-by-us-navy-pilots" data-link-name="in body link">declassified by the Pentagon</a> in recent years, have a perfectly logical explanation.</p><p>“When you dig into those kinds of observations, and we had hundreds, you go back and work with the pilot, you work with the sensor, and you reconstruct the entire engagement, nine times out of 10 or more that turns into an optical illusion that we call <a href="https://www.space.com/30417-parallax.html" data-link-name="in body link">parallax</a>,” he said.</p><p>“Most of the times when we can’t give an explanation, it is because there is a lack of data, and by that I mean consistent, solid, recorded data that you can put into a computer and you can do analysis on.”</p><p>Even so, Kirkpatrick said, there are those unlikely to ever accept scientific explanations.</p><p>“There is absolutely nothing that I’m going to do, say or produce evidentially that is going to make the true believers convert,” he said.</p><p>“It is basically a religion, a religious belief that transcends critical thinking and rational thought.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Now that they're seeing widespread adoption, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/sim-esim-and-isim/" rel="nofollow">eSIMs</a> have started to change the way we shop for cell phone coverage. Since they're built into your device, they eliminate the need to physically remove your SIM card when you want to switch plans. The convenience of using software to download and provision SIM plans is undeniable, but there's a catch – transferring plans between devices isn't as straightforward as it used to be. To move your plan, you often need to go through the whole setup process again, which can range from simply using your carrier's app to visiting a store for a QR code scan. While eSIMs simplify carrier changes or plan trials, they bring new challenges in device transitions.</p>

<p>Google recognized this issue, and at last year's Mobile World Congress, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-partnerships-connected-devices-mwc-barcelona/" rel="nofollow">announced its solution</a>. The company promised to introduce a new <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-esim-transfer-tool/" rel="nofollow">eSIM transfer tool for Android</a>, designed to let users securely and swiftly move their mobile plans to new devices, bypassing the need for physical SIMs. Although Google was tight-lipped about the specifics and the launch date of this feature, its practical implementation was <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/googles-esim-transfer-tool-finally-here-pixel-8/" rel="nofollow">first noticed</a> by users setting up their <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-8/" rel="nofollow">Pixel 8</a>. People were able to transfer their T-Mobile eSIM to their Pixel 8 from their older Pixel device, which led some to believe the feature might be limited to Google's own devices. However, it turns out that’s not the case.</p>

<p>While setting up their brand-new <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s24/" rel="nofollow">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, one of our readers decided to use Samsung’s SIM transfer tool. To their surprise, a pop-up appeared on their nearby LG V60 ThinQ that invited them to transfer their SIM to their Galaxy S24 Ultra by scanning a QR code. I was also able to get this pop-up to appear on my Pixel 8 Pro, as shown below. It's important to note, though, that this feature currently seems to work exclusively with T-Mobile eSIM profiles, aligning with Google's earlier mention at MWC 2023 that Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile's parent company, would be one of the first carriers to support this feature.</p>

<p>Samsung's role in this development is particularly noteworthy. Their SIM transfer tool, originally <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-beat-google-physical-sim-esim-conversions/" rel="nofollow">added in the One UI 5.1 release</a>, previously only supported transferring eSIM profiles between Galaxy devices. A keen-eyed tipster, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fragmentedchicken" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FragmentedChicken</a> on Reddit, noticed a subtle change in the tool's language in the latest One UI 6.1 update. The tool now indicates compatibility with non-Galaxy devices, hinting at a broader usability.</p>
<!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":1383} --><!-- Zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- No ads allowed! --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"stopAds":null,"actualCount":0} -->
<p>As it turns out, this change is more than just cosmetic; it's actually a shift towards utilizing Google’s eSIM transfer mechanism. When my Galaxy S24 Ultra was open on this page, a pop-up provided by the Google Play Services app appeared on my nearby Android devices, such as my Pixel 8 Pro. This pop-up is part of the EsimTransferHalfSheetActivity that was first spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/AssembleDebug/status/1693469209316188568" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AssembleDebug</a> last August. The rollout of this feature represents a major step forward in eSIM support on Android, allowing eSIM transfers between any Android phone, albeit subject to carrier support.</p>

<p>In essence, the eSIM transfer tool that Google announced at MWC 2023 has quietly but effectively been launched. The pop-up has been tested and confirmed to appear both ways, i.e., when attempting to transfer an eSIM from a Galaxy S24 Ultra back to a Pixel 8 Pro. Although carrier support is still limited, this advancement still marks a significant milestone in Android's ability to manage eSIMs, providing users with enhanced flexibility and convenience in managing their mobile plans across different devices.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://brave.com/leo-mixtral/">https://brave.com/leo-mixtral/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39152763">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>With today’s desktop browser update (v1.62), we are excited to announce that we have integrated Mixtral 8x7B as the default large language model (LLM) in <a href="https://brave.com/leo/">Leo</a>, our recently released, privacy-preserving AI browser assistant. <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mixtral 8x7B</a> is an open source LLM released by <a href="https://mistral.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mistral AI</a> this past December, and has already seen broad usage due to its speed and performance. In addition, we’ve made several improvements to the Leo user experience, focusing on clearer onboarding, context controls, input and response formatting, and general UI polish.</p>

<h2 id="unveiling-mixtral-8x7b">Unveiling Mixtral 8x7B</h2>
<p>Mixtral is now the default LLM for all Leo users, for the free version and the Premium version ($15/month). The free version is rate limited, and subscribers to Leo Premium benefit from higher rate limits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mixtral 8x7B quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a>. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the BBQ benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>Among other benefits, Mixtral can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle larger contexts</li>
<li>Interact in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish</li>
<li>Generate code</li>
</ul>
<p>Brave is already using Mixtral for its newly released <a href="https://brave.com/codellm/">Code LLM</a> feature for programming-related queries in <a href="https://brave.com/search/">Brave Search</a>, and the combination of Mixtral’s performance with its open source nature made it a natural fit for integration in Leo, given Brave’s commitment to open models and the open source community.</p>
<p>“Since its release, Brave Leo has been adopted by tens of thousands of free tier users and paid subscribers, and we expect even greater adoption as we expand our availability of LLMs to include Mixtral,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder at Brave. “Our aim is to create novel and convenient use cases in the context of users’ browsing sessions, and to help our users interact with the Web in groundbreaking ways.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are very happy to see Mixtral being used to power CodeLLM in Brave Search, and to now have Mixtral integrated in Brave Leo,” said Arthur Mensch, CEO at Mistral Al. “Making Mixtral available as an open model enables Brave to easily integrate it and to fulfill their users’ growing AI needs.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="giving-leo-users-choice-with-a-variety-of-llms">Giving Leo users choice with a variety of LLMs</h2>
<p>Unlike other AI assistants, Brave Leo offers its users the flexibility to choose from different models according to their needs and budget. While we’ve added Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM for both the free and premium versions of Brave Leo, we also offer Claude Instant from Anthropic in the free version (with rate limits) and for Premium. The free and premium versions of Leo also feature the Llama 2 13B model from Meta.</p>
<p>With Mixtral’s integration, Leo users will notice a significant performance improvement in the answer/result quality. Regarding the free Leo version, users will also have the option to revert to the previous Leo experience with Llama 2 and continue their AI experience once they reach the rate limits for Mixtral.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-always-comes-first">Privacy always comes first</h2>
<p>Privacy remains paramount for Brave Leo. Chats with Leo are private, anonymous, and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. Privacy protections in Leo include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reverse proxy</strong>: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate discarding of responses</strong>: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded immediately after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers.</li>
<li><strong>No login or account required for access</strong>: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Unlinkable subscription</strong>: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would like to inform you that the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) is expected to end this spring unless Congress appropriates additional funding. As a result, the FCC has begun taking steps to wind down the ACP. The FCC projects that households enrolled in the ACP will continue to receive the benefit on their internet service through April 2024. This date is an estimate and may change.</p><p>In 2021, Congress established the Affordable Connectivity Program in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and appropriated $14.2 billion for the program. The FCC was tasked to develop and implement the ACP as well as ACP outreach and awareness activities. As of today, over 22 million households are enrolled and receiving the ACP monthly benefit.</p><p><strong>What’s happening?</strong><br>Without additional funding from Congress, the FCC anticipates that the current ACP funding is projected to run out in April 2024. This date is an estimate and may change. As a result, the FCC has begun taking steps to wind down the ACP, which means:</p><ul><li>No new ACP enrollments will be accepted after February 7, 2024 at 11:59 PM ET.</li><li>Households that enrolled with an ACP internet company before February 7, 2024 at 11:59 PM ET will continue to receive their ACP benefit until ACP funds run out as long as the household remains enrolled and eligible for the benefit.</li><li>When ACP funds run out, households participating in the ACP will no longer receive the ACP discounts.</li></ul><p><strong>What should ACP households expect?</strong><br>All households enrolled in the ACP will continue to receive the benefit on their internet service until ACP funding, which is currently projected through April 2024, runs out.</p><p>Eligible households who wish to receive the ACP benefit but have not yet applied for the program should submit a completed ACP application as soon as possible to allow time for processing so that an eligibility determination can be made and the eligible household can sign up with an internet company by February 7, 2024 at 11:59 PM ET. To reiterate – during this program wind-down period, households must BOTH submit their application on a timely basis in order to be approved AND if qualified sign up with an ACP-eligible internet company by February 7, 2024 at 11:59 PM ET to receive the benefit.</p><p>During the ACP wind-down period, ACP households will receive notices from their internet company about the impact of the end of the benefit on the household’s bill and service.

<h2 id="about">About rclone</h2>
<p>Rclone is a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage. It
is a feature-rich alternative to cloud vendors' web storage
interfaces. <a href="#providers">Over 70 cloud storage products</a> support
rclone including S3 object stores, business &amp; consumer file storage
services, as well as standard transfer protocols.</p>
<p>Rclone has powerful cloud equivalents to the unix commands rsync, cp,
mv, mount, ls, ncdu, tree, rm, and cat. Rclone's familiar syntax
includes shell pipeline support, and <code>--dry-run</code> protection. It is
used at the command line, in scripts or via its <a href="https://rclone.org/rc">API</a>.</p>
<p>Users call rclone <em>"The Swiss army knife of cloud storage"</em>, and
<em>"Technology indistinguishable from magic"</em>.</p>
<p>Rclone really looks after your data. It preserves timestamps and
verifies checksums at all times. Transfers over limited bandwidth;
intermittent connections, or subject to quota can be restarted, from
the last good file transferred. You can
<a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_check/">check</a> the integrity of your files. Where
possible, rclone employs server-side transfers to minimise local
bandwidth use and transfers from one provider to another without
using local disk.</p>
<p>Virtual backends wrap local and cloud file systems to apply
<a href="https://rclone.org/crypt/">encryption</a>,
<a href="https://rclone.org/compress/">compression</a>,
<a href="https://rclone.org/chunker/">chunking</a>,
<a href="https://rclone.org/hasher/">hashing</a> and
<a href="https://rclone.org/union/">joining</a>.</p>
<p>Rclone <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/">mounts</a> any local, cloud or
virtual filesystem as a disk on Windows,
macOS, linux and FreeBSD, and also serves these over
<a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_sftp/">SFTP</a>,

<a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_ftp/">FTP</a> and
<a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_dlna/">DLNA</a>.</p>
<p>Rclone is mature, open-source software originally inspired by rsync
and written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>. The friendly support
community is familiar with varied use cases. Official Ubuntu, Debian,
Fedora, Brew and Chocolatey repos. include rclone. For the latest
version <a href="https://rclone.org/downloads/">downloading from rclone.org</a> is recommended.</p>
<p>Rclone is widely used on Linux, Windows and Mac. Third-party
developers create innovative backup, restore, GUI and business
process solutions using the rclone command line or API.</p>
<p>Rclone does the heavy lifting of communicating with cloud storage.</p>

Soldati was relieved when the Dover District Court finally released its decision Jan. 19.</p><p>“When I filed the initial small claim in 2018, I was in my 20s and now I’m not in my 20s, I had hair on my head and now I don’t have hair on my head,” Soldati said. “I just sort of feel like, how on earth did this take so long?”</p><media-image image-set="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/2020/03/10/NPOH/ghows-SO-f7b5646c-40a8-4a99-abfc-f09567afb0c5-0acaac9d.jpeg bestCrop, https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/2020/03/10/NPOH/ghows-SO-f7b5646c-40a8-4a99-abfc-f09567afb0c5-0acaac9d.jpeg?crop=4021,3023,x5,y0 4:3, https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/2020/03/10/NPOH/ghows-SO-f7b5646c-40a8-4a99-abfc-f09567afb0c5-0acaac9d.jpeg?crop=2268,3023,x882,y0 3:4, https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/2020/03/10/NPOH/ghows-SO-f7b5646c-40a8-4a99-abfc-f09567afb0c5-0acaac9d.jpeg?crop=4031,2277,x0,y373 16:9" image-alt="" credit="Portsmouth Herald" caption="Emmett Soldati, owner of Teatotaller cafe, has won his case against Meta (formerly Facebook) over deleting the business's Instagram account, representing himself in court." orientation="horizontal" util-module-path="elements/media"></media-image><p>Soldati’s win wasn’t just a win for him, he said, but a win for all Instagram users and small business owners who have faced similar problems with the tech company.</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><h2>Why did Soldati file a claim against Facebook?</h2><p>Teatotaller, which has been described on Yelp as a “queer, hipster oasis of tea, coffee, and pastry goodness,” first opened in 2011 in Somersworth. It has since closed in Somersworth and now has locations in Dover and Concord. From the beginning, Soldati's business used Instagram heavily as a way to engage and find customers.</p><p>By 2018, Teatotaller had a large following to whom it promoted shows, specials, and other items. Soldati paid Instagram and Facebook for use of the professional platform.</p><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><cta-atoms-container-inline util-module-path="elements/cta"></cta-atoms-container-inline><p>When he first found himself unable to log in to his account in June 2018, he thought there was some kind of technical glitch.</p><p>“Over the course of 24 hours realizing it was deleted, I was very concerned,” Soldati said. All users could see when they tried to look at the account was a blank screen. “And so, you know, anyone might assume we don't exist anymore or we closed or whatnot and all of the shows and events and specials that we were just sort of planning to engage with our audience, we didn't have that line of communication.”</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="600" outstream="" momentum=""></partner-banner><p>Having no luck with Instagram's help support, he decided to file a small claim in the Dover District Court, thinking Facebook would “get the memo” and either give the account back or pay him a couple hundred bucks to repay him for lost revenue.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“</strong>What was interesting is after I filed that claim, Facebook's response to it was so enormous and sort of so disproportionate to what I was, at the time, ultimately claiming: in their eyes, a relatively small account, small business owner just seeking a quick fix,” Soldati said. “And they sort of threw the book at me and had this massive memo and motion to dismiss that had like 10 points of why Facebook doesn't owe me anything. That was the moment that I realized that I had sort of struck some kind of nerve.”</p><h2>How did Soldati beat Facebook?</h2><p>Despite Facebook hiring several law firms to defend their case, Soldati, representing himself, was able to successfully argue Meta/Facebook committed a breach of contract and that they were not immune under the Communications Decency Act.</p><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><p>Soldati argued that by deleting his account with no explanation or warning, Meta had broken its contract set in the terms of service, and therefore was a breach of contract. In response, Meta claimed Soldati had accidentally deleted the account himself. But Soldati had screenshots from the day his account was deleted.</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><p>“The defendant provided two conflicting reasons for the deletion and was unable to specify a clear reason for the deletion,” read the court’s final order. “This court finds that the plaintiff has met their burden showing that they did not delete their own account.”</p><p>The court ruled in favor of Soldati that Facebook had committed a breach of contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Meta also argued it was immune to any cases brought against them under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA), which is often used to obtain immunity from claims involving the publishing or deletion of material on its platforms.</p><p>When Soldati originally filed his claim in the Dover District Court in 2018, it was dismissed under this section. But when he appealed it to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, they decided that Facebook was actually<a href="https://www.fosters.com/story/news/2020/07/24/teatotaller-gets-nh-supreme-court-win-over-facebook-instagram-which-deleted-cafersquos-account/113763892/"> not immune from liability</a> under the CDA. This win send the case back to the Dover District Court to issue a ruling on the small claim.</p><p>This time, the Dover District Court found Meta didn’t keep its promise to Teatotaller and deleted the account “without sufficient basis, and inconsistent with the reasons they have provided in the&nbsp;<em>Terms of Use.”</em></p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><p>The order ends, “Accordingly, the defendant is not entitled to immunity under the CDA.”&nbsp;</p><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><p>Meta’s motion to dismiss also included some other arguments Soldati calls “bogus.” It argued Instagram and Facebook (now Meta) aren’t the same company, but Facebook bought Instagram in 2012, six years before Soldati’s account was deleted. It also argued Meta doesn’t do any business in New Hampshire, but it markets and advertises to New Hampshire users. The company also argued Facebook is a free service which nobody pays for, but Soldati and other professional account owners do pay. These arguments ultimately failed.</p><h2>So why did Facebook delete Teatotaller’s account?</h2><p>Meta never gave an explanation for why it deleted Teatotaller's account.</p><p>While Teatotaller is known for supporting LGBTQ rights and has had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fosters.com/story/news/2018/01/08/vandals-strike-somersworth-billboard/16354567007/">daring billboards promoting the business vandalized</a>, Soldati doesn’t think that was the reason for the deletion.</p><p>“It’s very possible that Facebook just screwed up,” Soldati said, but he thinks the company wouldn’t want to admit that.</p><p><strong>“</strong>If Facebook made a technological misstep that damaged the integrity of some of their users accounts, that's a credibility risk and it's a shareholder risk,” Soldati said. “And so I think a big aspect of this and why they shifted to trying to pretend that I deleted the account was because the true reason of its deletion could actually be something that undermines the promise that they claim to bring the users that, 'Hey, don't worry, as long as you follow the rules and don't post offensive material, whatever, you're good. And we're going to keep your account safe. We're going to keep your account active.'”</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><h2>What does this win mean for Soldati and other Facebook users?</h2><p>The District Court's ruling awarded Soldati $100 plus costs, and Soldati said the final amount is still pending. He said it will probably be just a few hundred dollars, maybe a few thousand dollars.</p><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><p>It’s nothing compared to the time he’s spent on the case, or what his business lost from the initial account deletion. To him, what’s more important is the repercussions of this decision.&nbsp;</p><p>The New Hampshire Supreme Court is now the highest court to have decided against Facebook’s CDA defense, according to Soldati.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“</strong>I can be happy about the hundreds of dollars I put in my pocket. But ultimately, this will sort of stand as an example of like, they can't continue to throw the book at people and say, 'No, you don't have a claim here because we're immune,'” said Soldati. “Because now people can point to the New Hampshire Supreme Court and a small claims court in Dover, New Hampshire, and say here a judge found that you didn't pass the test.”</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><p>Soldati said he hopes courts start to see Meta as a monopoly. He initially filed his claim because there wasn’t another place for him to market his small business.</p><p>“It’s not like I can sell bubble tea on Twitter the way I can market it on a reel or a story or a post,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>During the years-long course of the trial, he received lots of messages from people facing similar situations. A New York Times article reported many users had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/technology/instagram-accounts-suspended.html">their accounts deleted</a>&nbsp;in 2022. He hopes individual users can use this decision to gain power and leverage against the social media great.</p><p>“Atsome point some court has to review this and say, 'Maybe Facebook should not have as much power to completely dominate and control not only the social media landscape, but our court system,'” Soldati said.</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><p>In court, Soldati said Facebook attorneys were condescending and patronizing to him, but he took it seriously because it was his livelihood and because he thought that someone needed to fight them. He says it was “100%” worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Gary Burt, a Manchester lawyer who represented Meta in the New Hampshire Supreme Court as well as the Dover District Court, did not immediately respond to a request to comment for this story.</p><lit-timestamp slot="timestamp" publishdate="2024-01-26 10:23:53 +0000 UTC" updatedate="2024-01-26 15:09:27 +0000 UTC"></lit-timestamp><p><a alt="Post the article to your Facebook Timeline" data-size="large" onclick="fireNavShareAnalytics('facebook');" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><svg view-box="0 0 24 24">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Plastic pollution is a menace worldwide. Plastics are now <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg5433">found</a> in every <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.1c04158">environment</a> on the planet, from the deepest seas to the atmosphere and human bodies. </p>

<p>Scientific evidence <a href="https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.4056">describing harm</a> to the environment and humans is growing. Hence, the United Nations has <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/39812/OEWG_PP_1_INF_1_UNEA%20resolution.pdf">resolved</a> to <a href="https://enb.iisd.org/negotiations/international-legally-binding-instrument-plastics-pollution-including-marine#:%7E:text=The%20United%20Nations%20Environment%20Assembly,pollution%2C%20including%20in%20the%20marine">negotiate</a> a legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution.  </p>

<p>Strategies to achieve this goal include provisions throughout the plastics lifespan: production, use, waste management and remediation. </p>

<p>In designing rules for managing plastic, it’s important to understand that plastic materials and waste streams are complex. Not all plastics are the same. And recycled plastics are not necessarily “better” – less harmful – than virgin plastics. If they contained harmful chemicals to begin with, recycling doesn’t make them less harmful. And sometimes they are contaminated by other substances.</p>

<p>We conducted a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340923008090?via%3Dihub">study</a> identifying and measuring the concentration of contaminants in recycled pellets from 28 small-scale recycling facilities in the global south. Plastic waste is often exported from high income countries to less developed countries, with few to no requirements for reporting their makeup.</p>

<p>Our investigation covered facilities in Cameroon, Mauritius, Nigeria, Tanzania and Togo in Africa as well others in Asia, Europe and South America. </p>

<p>We found 191 pesticides, 107 pharmaceuticals and 81 industrial compounds among many others in the recycled plastic pellets. Many of these chemicals could be hazardous and make the plastics unsuitable for reuse.</p>

<p>This finding can inform regulations for recycled plastics. The chemical composition of the plastic should be checked before it is recycled. </p>

<h2>Chemicals used in production of plastics</h2>

<p>More than <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/chemicals-plastics-technical-report">13,000 chemicals</a> are currently used in the production of plastic materials and products. They can include thousands of plastics additives – but also substances that are added unintentionally. Some unwanted chemicals form during the production or life of plastics. Thousands of these chemicals have dangerous properties. The health risks of some others are unknown. </p>

<p>Throughout the plastics value chain, during production, use, waste and recycling, other chemicals can contaminate the material too. The result may be recycled materials whose chemical composition is unknown. </p>

<p>Previous studies have reported the presence of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.10.014">plastics additives</a> in recycled materials. Among them were chemicals that are <a href="https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/chemicals-waste/what-we-do/emerging-issues/endocrine-disrupting-chemicals">known</a> to have <a href="https://www.epa.gov/endocrine-disruption/overview-endocrine-disruption">negative effects on health</a>. Examples include <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055387">phthalates</a> (plastic softeners), bisphenols like <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303720706002292">BPA</a>, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721044478?via%3Dihub">UV-stabilisers</a> used to protect plastics from sun damage and yellowing.</p>

<p>In our work, we established the presence of chemicals in recycled plastic that can cause harm to humans or other organisms. They include pesticides, pharmaceuticals and fragrances. Others are chemicals that result from burning natural materials, man-made organic chemicals used for industrial applications like paint, and ultraviolet filters.</p>

<p>We quantified a total of 491 different chemical substances. Some had specific uses and others formed from the breakdown of products.</p>

<p>Some national and regional policies <a href="https://www.basel.int/Implementation/Plasticwaste/Globalgovernance/tabid/8335/Default.aspx">regulate</a> the allowable concentration of hazardous chemicals in specific plastic products. But only 1% of plastics chemicals are subject to international regulation in existing multilateral environmental agreements. Policies don’t adequately address the issue of transparent reporting of chemicals in plastics across their value chain. Also, there are no laws to govern monitoring of chemicals in recycled materials. This is a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk9846">serious gap</a> in oversight. Stronger and more globally coordinated measures are necessary. </p>

<p>Our findings emphasise the importance of regulating mechanical recycling, as many of the substances measured were contaminants and not plastic additives. Many of the chemicals we identified may have contaminated the materials during use. For example, a jug used for storing pesticides will absorb some of the pesticides and will contaminate the recycling waste stream. Plastics in the environment are also known to absorb <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X11005960">organic pollutants</a>. </p>

<p>To assess the quality of recycled plastics, it’s crucial to know which chemicals are present and in what concentrations. This information can guide regulations about how recycled plastics may be used. It will also be valuable for plastics producers, waste management workers (including recyclers), consumers, and the scientific community.</p>

<h2>A path towards safer reuse of plastics</h2>

<p>To recycle more materials safely, several changes are necessary. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>increased transparency regarding the use of chemicals and their risks </p></li>
<li><p>chemical simplification of the plastics market, so that fewer and less toxic chemicals are permitted for use</p></li>
<li><p>improved waste management infrastructure with separated waste streams  </p></li>
<li><p>improved recycling methods, including monitoring of hazardous chemicals.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Chemical simplification of plastic additives will promote sustainability, safety and regulatory compliance. It will help manufacturers to minimise the environmental impact and adverse health effects of complex chemical formulations. Simpler chemical structures also improve the recycling potential of plastics and make recycling more efficient and cost-effective.</p>

<p><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.1c04903">Chemical simplification</a> can also reduce potential health risks in the disposal of plastic materials. </p>

<p>From a regulatory perspective, chemical simplification supports clearer and more enforceable safety guidelines.</p>

<p>It’s is a crucial step towards the sustainable production and use of plastics, as  countries work towards a legal instrument to end pollution.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple’s new rules in the European Union mean browsers like Firefox can finally use their own engines on iOS. Although this may seem like a welcome change, Mozilla spokesperson&nbsp;Damiano DeMonte tells <em>The Verge</em> it’s “extremely disappointed” with the way things turned out.</p><p>“We are still reviewing the technical details but are extremely disappointed with Apple’s proposed plan to restrict the newly-announced BrowserEngineKit to EU-specific apps,” DeMonte says. “The effect of this would be to force an independent browser like Firefox to build and maintain two separate browser implementations — a burden Apple themselves will not have to bear.”</p><p>In iOS 17.4, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050478/apple-ios-17-4-browser-engines-eu">Apple will no longer force browsers</a> in the EU to use WebKit, the underlying engine that powers Safari. The change opens the door for other popular engines, such as Blink, which is used by Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, as well as Gecko, the engine used by Firefox. It also means third-party browsers could become fully functional on iOS without any of the limitations that come along with WebKit. </p><p>Despite this, Mozilla argues that rolling out the changes only in the EU will make it more difficult for browsers to juggle different versions. “Apple’s proposals fail to give consumers viable choices by making it as painful as possible for others to provide competitive alternatives to Safari,” DeMonte adds. “This is another example of Apple creating barriers to prevent true browser competition on iOS.”</p><p>Mozilla isn’t the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051818/apple-app-store-dma-eu-developer-response">only developer critical of Apple’s new rules</a>, which also extend to game streaming apps, alternative app stores, and sideloading. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney called the new terms a “horror show,” while <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-01-26/apples-proposed-changes-reject-the-goals-of-the-dma/">Spotify said the changes</a> are a “farce.” Apple’s guidelines are still pending approval by the EU Commission.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/third-party-iphone-app-stores-ios-17-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple announced</a> some major changes to the App Store and the broader iPhone platform in the European Union, including support for alternative app marketplaces. There’s one piece of nuance that Apple is now clarifying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of these changes are coming to all of Apple’s platforms, while others are coming <em>only</em> to the iPhone and not the iPad.</p>



<p>There is reason for this nuance. Apple explains that the European Union ruled that iOS is a gatekeeper platform as part of the Digital Markets Act. This applies only to iOS on the iPhone. iPadOS on the iPad is a completely different platform in the eyes of Apple and the European Commission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the Digital Markets Act designates the entirety of the App Store as a gatekeeper service. In the eyes of the European Commission, this includes the App Store across all of Apple’s platforms: iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV.</p>




	<p>With that in mind, Apple has bifurcated these changes based on the requirements of the DMA. Changes coming to the App Store are coming to all of Apple’s platforms, while changes to the iPhone are coming <em>only</em> to the iPhone, even if iOS shares a lot of the same codebase as iPadOS.</p>



<p>Here’s what that means in practice.</p>



<ul>
<li>The ability to install third-party app marketplaces and download apps from third-party app marketplaces will be an option <em>only</em> on the iPhone.</li>



<li>The new <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/26/apple-shares-more-details-about-the-new-default-web-browser-prompt-in-ios-17-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prompt in Safari</a> that asks users to pick a default browser engine is coming <em>only</em> to the iPhone.</li>



<li>Support for third-<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/third-party-default-browsers-engines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">party browser engines</a> is coming <em>only</em> to the iPhone.</li>



<li>The ability to set default NFC and wallet apps will <em>only</em> be available on the iPhone.</li>



<li>Changes to App Store policy to allow <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/apple-announces-reduced-commission-structure-for-apps-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alternative payments and lower commissions</a> affect the App Store across all Apple platforms.</li>



<li>Changes to the App Store guidelines to allow <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/apple-game-streaming-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game streaming apps</a> impact all of Apple’s platforms.</li>
</ul>



<p>All of these changes are coming as part of iOS 17.4, which is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-beta-1-new-features/">currently available in developer beta testing</a>.</p>

This is a supercomputing architecture that's built specifically to run AI applications, rather than supercomputers which normally run scientific workloads, because TPUs are unsuited to this.</p><p>The latest version of its TPU has 8,960 chips per pod (which comprise the system), versus 4,096 in v4, and it's four times as scalable in terms of total availability of FLOPs per pod. These new pods provide a throughput of 4,800Gbps.

Although the intermediary version, TPU v5e, released earlier this year, offers the most value for money of all three, it's only up to 1.9-times faster than TPU v4, making TPU v5p the most powerful.</p><p>It's even powerful enough to rival Nvidia's widely in-demand H100 GPU, which is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/best-graphics-cards-1291458" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/best-graphics-cards-1291458"><u>best graphics cards</u></a> out there for AI workloads.
