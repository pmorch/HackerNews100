            <span>Abstract:</span>Transformer tends to overallocate attention to irrelevant context. In this work, we introduce Diff Transformer, which amplifies attention to the relevant context while canceling noise. Specifically, the differential attention mechanism calculates attention scores as the difference between two separate softmax attention maps. The subtraction cancels noise, promoting the emergence of sparse attention patterns. Experimental results on language modeling show that Diff Transformer outperforms Transformer in various settings of scaling up model size and training tokens. More intriguingly, it offers notable advantages in practical applications, such as long-context modeling, key information retrieval, hallucination mitigation, in-context learning, and reduction of activation outliers. By being less distracted by irrelevant context, Diff Transformer can mitigate hallucination in question answering and text summarization. For in-context learning, Diff Transformer not only enhances accuracy but is also more robust to order permutation, which was considered as a chronic robustness issue. The results position Diff Transformer as a highly effective and promising architecture to advance large language models.

    The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">CAP Theorem</a> is a
    fundamental theorem in distributed systems that states any distributed
    system can have at most two of the following three properties.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>C</strong>onsistency</li>
      <li><strong>A</strong>vailability</li>
      <li><strong>P</strong>artition tolerance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    This guide will summarize
    <a href="http://lpd.epfl.ch/sgilbert/pubs/BrewersConjecture-SigAct.pdf">
      Gilbert and Lynch's specification and proof of the CAP Theorem</a>
    with pictures!
    </p>

    <h2>What is the CAP Theorem?</h2>
    <p>
    The CAP theorem states that a distributed system cannot simultaneously be
    consistent, available, and partition tolerant. Sounds simple enough, but
    what does it mean to be consistent? available? partition tolerant? Heck,
    what exactly do you even mean by a distributed system?
    </p>

    <p>
    In this section, we'll introduce a simple distributed system and explain
    what it means for that system to be available, consistent, and partition
    tolerant.  For a formal description of the system and the three properties,
    please refer to
    <a href="http://lpd.epfl.ch/sgilbert/pubs/BrewersConjecture-SigAct.pdf">
      Gilbert and Lynch's paper</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>A Distributed System</h2>
    <p>
    Let's consider a very simple distributed system. Our system is composed of
    two servers, $G_1$ and $G_2$. Both of these servers are keeping track of
    the same variable, $v$, whose value is initially $v_0$. $G_1$ and $G_2$
    can communicate with each other and can also communicate with external
    clients. Here's what our system looks like.
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap1.svg">
    </center>

    <p>
    A client can request to write and read from any server. When a server
    receives a request, it performs any computations it wants and then responds
    to the client. For example, here is what a write looks like.
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap2.svg">

      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap4.svg">
    </center>

    <p>
    And here is what a read looks like.
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap5.svg">
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap6.svg">
    </center>

    <p>
    Now that we've gotten our system established, let's go over what it means
    for the system to be consistent, available, and partition tolerant.
    </p>

    <h2>Consistency</h2>
    <p>
    Here's how Gilbert and Lynch describe consistency.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    any read operation that begins after a write operation completes must
    return that value, or the result of a later write operation
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    In a consistent system, once a client writes a value to any server and gets
    a response, it expects to get that value (or a fresher value) back from any
    server it reads from.
    </p>

    <p>
    Here is an example of an <strong>inconsistent</strong> system.
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap7.svg">
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap8.svg">
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap9.svg">
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap10.svg">
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap11.svg">
    </center>

    <p>
    Our client writes $v_1$ to $G_1$ and $G_1$ acknowledges, but when it
    reads from $G_2$, it gets stale data: $v_0$.
    </p>

    <p>
    On the other hand, here is an example of a <strong>consistent</strong>
    system.
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap12.svg">
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap13.svg">
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap14.svg">
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap15.svg">
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap16.svg">
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap17.svg">
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap18.svg">
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap19.svg">
    </center>

    <p>
    In this system, $G_1$ replicates its value to $G_2$ before sending an
    acknowledgement to the client. Thus, when the client reads from $G_2$, it
    gets the most up to date value of $v$: $v_1$.
    </p>

    <h2>Availability</h2>
    <p>
    Here's how Gilbert and Lynch describe availability.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    every request received by a non-failing node in the system must result in a
    response
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    In an available system, if our client sends a request to a server and the
    server has not crashed, then the server must eventually respond to the
    client. The server is not allowed to ignore the client's requests.
    </p>

    <h2>Partition Tolerance</h2>
    <p>
    Here's how Gilbert and Lynch describe partitions.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    the network will be allowed to lose arbitrarily many messages sent from one
    node to another
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    This means that any messages $G_1$ and $G_2$ send to one another can be
    dropped.  If all the messages were being dropped, then our system would
    look like this.
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap20.svg">
    </center>

    <p>
    Our system has to be able to function correctly despite arbitrary network
    partitions in order to be partition tolerant.
    </p>

    <h2>The Proof</h2>
    <p>
    Now that we've acquainted ourselves with the notion of consistency,
    availability, and partition tolerance, we can prove that a system cannot
    simultaneously have all three.
    </p>

    <p>
    Assume for contradiction that there does exist a system that is consistent,
    available, and partition tolerant. The first thing we do is partition our
    system. It looks like this.
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap21.svg">
    </center>

    <p>
    Next, we have our client request that $v_1$ be written to $G_1$. Since
    our system is available, $G_1$ must respond. Since the network is
    partitioned, however, $G_1$ cannot replicate its data to $G_2$. Gilbert
    and Lynch call this phase of execution $\alpha_1$.
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap22.svg">
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap23.svg">
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap24.svg">
    </center>

    <p>
    Next, we have our client issue a read request to $G_2$. Again, since our
    system is available, $G_2$ must respond. And since the network is
    partitioned, $G_2$ cannot update its value from $G_1$. It returns $v_0$.
    Gilbert and Lynch call this phase of execution $\alpha_2$.
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap25.svg">
      <img src="https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/assets/cap26.svg">
    </center>

    <p>
    $G_2$ returns $v_0$ to our client after the client had already written
    $v_1$ to $G_1$. This is inconsistent.
    </p>

    <p>
    We assumed a consistent, available, partition tolerant system existed, but
    we just showed that there exists an execution for any such system in which
    the system acts inconsistently. Thus, no such system exists.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><strong>In my job I get to speak to lots of people about Rust. Some are just starting out, some have barely ever heard of it, and then some people are running Rust silently in production at a very large company in a very serious product.</strong></p><div><p>A while back, I had the fortune to talk with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julius-gustavsson/">Julius Gustavsson</a> from Sweden and he squarely falls in the last category of people. From 2019 onwards, he has been the main software architect for the low-power processor ECU (electronic control unit) at <a href="https://www.volvo.com/en/">Volvo</a>.</p><p>This ECU is responsible for the (low) power management of the car. Electric cars obviously have massive high-voltage batteries, but the classic 12 volt lines are still there. Those lines are always on and can drain the battery if there's any power usage, so you want all car systems to be turned off when you're away from your car. The ECU is responsible for waking up the electric system when needed, for example when you approach the car.</p><p>This ECU was not actively being worked on in 2019 and so Julius became part of a new dedicated team. But even back in 2017, when Julius joined Volvo, he already knew about Rust and saw its potential to replace existing C and C++ code.</p><p>It turned out the low-power processor was a perfect fit for using Rust! It was not classified as a safety-critical component and it was an Arm Cortex-M processor, so there was no technical or bureaucratic blocker for using Rust.</p><p>And so it has come to be that, at this moment, EX90s and Polestar 3s are rolling off the assembly line that would not work without their Rust components.</p><p>I think that's a great milestone for Rust!</p><p>I wanted to know more about this and thought the world would too, so Julius has kindly agreed to let me interview him. Here's everything we talked about:</p><h3 id="q-why-did-you-pick-rust">Q: Why did you pick Rust?</h3><p>Julius told me his first job was building air traffic control software, where a lot of Ada is used. A competitor was even required to use Ada by the US Air Force. "The language is amazing in its own way. However, the consensus at the company was that Ada was both too arcane and to proprietary for them, at that time."</p><p>And so he used a mixture of C and C++ for about 15 years. "At all different companies I worked at they all had different strategies and strictness, but memory-related bugs were always a problem".</p><p>"It always felt unsafe; Most codebases have a bunch of invariants and assumptions that are not written down but everyone must uphold. As the project grows in complexity and especially team size, this will inevitably fail at some point. After debugging the umpteenth bug, the thought came, 'Is this it? Isn't there a better way?'"</p><p>He had discovered Rust before its 1.0 release in 2015, and began paying more attention to it after the release. So when he joined Volvo Julius had a little bit of hobby experience. He had found it tricky to pick up the Rust concepts and had to read the O'Reilly book twice. However, "once it clicked, I got very enthusiastic."</p><p>Picking Rust for the ECU project didn't come out of the blue.</p><p>"When we were prototyping the precursor to the project, and doing interop with Android, I created a vehicle HAL in Rust using futures 0.1, back in the days before async, for Android that spoke grpc to the Rust system," he explained.</p><p>Describing the project, he said: "We'd have buttons on the screen to control the fans of the car. I had to write a lot of code before I could compile it all, a big jenga tower. But once it compiled, the fans started to work! Very impressed."</p><p>It was difficult to figure out how to build Rust for use with Android, which was the platform this prototype ran on. Today much more effort has been put in tooling around this, but Julius was there very early.</p><p>With this prototype he proved to himself and the people around him that Rust could be a serious option for production code; It delivered on its promises.</p><h3 id="q-how-did-it-go">Q: How did it go?</h3><p>Aside from the project being a good fit for Rust due to it not being safety-critical and running on common hardware, it was also quite straightforward due to its limited feature set.</p><p>In 2020 they had made a first proof-of-concept in C before continuing the project with Rust. What wasn't so straightforward was that the ECU had to communicate over CAN with the other systems in the car and they had to implement all diagnostics systems and port over the standard Volvo protocols.</p><p>So they needed to reimplement a lot of things. According to Julius though, they "got much higher quality". And they found they were writing far fewer bugs compared to C and C++.</p><p>Julius wasn't the only one really liking Rust. One of his colleagues had to leave and said: "It's hard to think about having to go back to something that's not Rust". Still, a healthy dose of scepticism remained. As Julius put it: "I always had the feeling, is Rust too good to be true? I'm always looking for the big pitfall. So far I have not found anything bad. Only some small things like const generics not being fully done."</p><p>As the project progressed, they got "a bigger and bigger pile of proof that Rust does actually work well".</p><p>There were regular cross-team meetings where team leads could discuss their problems. As time went on it became more and more noticeable that Julius didn't bring up many issues at all and when he showed his results, his colleagues were often left impressed.</p><h3 id="q-would-you-recommend-rust-to-others">Q: Would you recommend Rust to others?</h3><p>"Definitely", Julius answered promptly.</p><p>He continues: "For any project where you have very strict reliability and availability requirements, and you want to be confident that what you deploy is actually correct, then Rust is an excellent choice! Also <code>cargo</code> and all the other available tooling make the whole cycle of developing high quality software a really nice experience."</p><p>Rust also works great for teams with high turnover because there's a lot of confidence in the code. "Other people can just take over the code and fiddle around safely because when it compiles, it almost always works".</p><p>"For prototyping, then maybe it's not the best option because things are rigid. The compiler forces you to work more on the edge cases and minute details up front, something you are not always interested in doing at that particular point", he noted. This, of course, is an often expressed sentiment.</p><p>But to put that in perspective, Julius says: "Rust would work for most of the software I've worked on professionally. There are absolutely cases where Rust is not the best fit. But I think we're at that point where instead of asking 'Can we use Rust for this?', we should be asking 'Why can't we use Rust for this?' And then you have the discussion."</p><h3 id="q-whats-missing-that-got-in-the-way">Q: What's missing that got in the way?</h3><p>It wasn't easy to create the software so that it properly fit the requirements, according to Julius. This is mostly a tooling issue.</p><p>For example, it was hard to run the unit tests on the embedded target. Other challenges included code coverage, runtime profiling, software BOM and license tracking. This is my personal experience as well, although the state of these issues has much improved over the last couple of years.</p><p>Julius and I agreed that it would be very valuable to build more and better tooling. He said: "Most are halfway there, but you still need to do a lot yourself".</p><p>During the project, things got better. Julius explicitly mentioned the <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs">Knurling</a> project, for example, and that those tools helped a lot.</p><h3 id="q-are-you-going-to-use-rust-in-the-future">Q: Are you going to use Rust in the future?</h3><p>"Yes."</p><p>In fact, Julius is actively cheerleading for other projects to pick up Rust. And there seems to be an overall enthusiasm for Rust at many  layers in the company.</p><p>A couple of days before my meeting with Julius, he had the final project presentation with the management. The result of that meeting was a common consensus among management to look into using Rust in more places.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>From our conversation it seems that using Rust has been a great success at Volvo thus far. People are happy, the quality of the product is high, and the company seems poised to use more Rust in the future.</p><p>It's obvious that there's more work to be done still, but with more safety-critical tooling like <a href="https://ferrocene.dev/en/">Ferrocene</a> becoming available, Rust is readier than ever for use in the automotive industry.</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <div><pre>This commit makes the DNS resolution code better suited for both
filtering on cname and ip address. The change allows early availability
of ip address so that `ipaddress=` option can be matched at
onBeforeRequest time.

As a result, it is now possible to block root document using
`ipaddress=` option -- so long as an ip address can be extracted
before first onBeforeRequest() call.

Caveat
------

the ip address used is the first one among the list of ip
addresses returned by dns.resolve() method. There is no way for uBO
to know which exact ip address will be used by the browser when
sending the request, so this is at most a best guess. The exact IP
address used by the browser is available at onHeadersReceived time,
and uBO will also filter according to this value, but by then the
network request has already been sent to the remote server.

Possibly a future improvement would make available the whole list
of ip addresses to the filtering engine, but even then it's impossible
to know with certainty which ip address will ultimately be used by the
browser -- it is entirely possible that the ip address used by the
browser might not be in the list received through dns.resolve().</pre></div>

Three years later, Graham stepped down as president of the company and crowned Altman as his successor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It soon became clear that the Y Combinator island wasn’t big enough to contain Altman’s ambitions. In 2015, while still president of the company, he co-founded a non-profit called OpenAI and became, along with Elon Musk, its co-chair. Within a few years, Altman and Musk were having disagreements—over, for example, who was alpha male. Musk left the OpenAI island and Altman settled in to run it.</p><p><span>I don’t think I’d be good at parachuting into cannibal-inhabited islands and securing political control of them, but I imagine that, if I </span><em>were</em><span> good at it, I’d follow this algorithm:&nbsp;</span></p><p>Be extremely nice and accommodating for a while, and gradually win the trust of the natives, who will thus cede increasing amounts of influence to you, until you have so much influence that you can drop the act and reveal your true ambitions. At that point you can eat them.</p><p>In this light, it’s worth revisiting Altman’s congressional testimony in May of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT had captured the world’s attention. He was a picture of humility and cooperation. He professed acute awareness of AI’s dangers and encouraged the regulation of OpenAI and other such companies. For a CEO to issue this kind of invitation was so unusual that it became the headline of the New York Times story about the hearings.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png" width="845" height="154" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/eb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:154,&quot;width&quot;:845,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:30269,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb6dccd7-6ccc-4aa9-adaa-80974a64e84f_845x154.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, who had chaired the hearings, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/technology/sam-altman-ai-regulations.html" rel="">said</a><span>, “It’s so refreshing. He was willing, able, and eager.”</span></p><p>Not to mention pure of heart! When one senator asked Altman if he made a lot of money from AI, he replied, “No. I’m paid enough for health insurance. I have no equity in OpenAI… I’m doing this because I love it.”&nbsp;</p><p>Fast forward to now:</p><p><span>This week California’s governor </span><a href="https://time.com/7026653/gavin-newsom-ai-safety-bill-sb-1047/" rel="">vetoed</a><span> an AI regulation bill that OpenAI opposed even though the bill had been watered down to a point where Anthropic, OpenAI’s rival, had dropped its initial opposition. And last week, with OpenAI poised to close an investment round that will bring in $6.5 billion at a valuation of $150 billion, we </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-remove-non-profit-control-give-sam-altman-equity-sources-say-2024-09-25/" rel="">learned</a><span> that the company plans to become a fully for-profit corporation (having converted to a quasi-for-profit in 2019).

Not content to just quote his congressional testimony about the irrelevance of money to his motivational structure, they circulated the video of it. Which really is worth watching, because you haven’t seen pious until you’ve seen Sam Altman do pious:</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://nonzero.substack.com/p/sam-altman-goes-full-emperor?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://nonzero.substack.com/p/sam-altman-goes-full-emperor?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>I take issue with these Altman haters; I think they’re hating on the wrong part of Altman. What’s scary about him isn’t that he’s good at getting rich (he’s a billionaire even without any OpenAI equity), but that, as Graham told a journalist in 2016, “Sam is extremely good at getting powerful.” I think he’s using that power—in Silicon Valley and in Washington DC and in various centers of influence around the world—to put the AI industry, and the world, on a dangerous course. Sometimes you even get the impression that he’s chosen this course because it would give him more power, and the rest of us are just along for the ride.</p><p><span>How to describe this course? Though Altman (wisely) wouldn’t use this term for it, I’d say it boils down to </span><em>accelerationism</em><span>—the idea that, when it comes to technological change, and progress in AI in particular, faster is better. There was a time when Altman sounded like the opposite of an accelerationist. Consider the view he expressed in 2022:</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><strong>The attack helicopter is costly and complex to operate, yet it is taking a mauling in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s full-scale invasion attempt of Ukraine starting in 2022 has shown both the vulnerability of helicopters and the effectiveness of small, uncrewed aircraft against armour. With this in mind, we ask: Is the attack helicopter dead? </strong></p>

</ul>



<p>Few observers thought Ukraine could withstand the Russian onslaught of 2022. Footage released in April footage of the destruction of a Russian Kamov attack helicopter was a huge morale boost. And more followed. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>The conflict in Ukraine has been marked by comparatively staggering losses of both anti-armour helicopters and armour. A quick internet search (July 2024) suggests the following losses:</em></p>



<p><em>Russia:</em><em></em></p>



<p><em>Tanks: “More than 3,000” (Feb 2024) </em><a href="http://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-relying-old-stocks-after-losing-3000-tanks-ukraine-leading-military-2024-02-13/"><em>www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-relying-old-stocks-after-losing-3000-tanks-ukraine-leading-military-2024-02-13/</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em><em></em></p>



<p><em>Helicopters: Flight Global “Kyiv claims to have destroyed 310 Russian helicopters since Moscow’s forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022, although this total cannot be independently verified. Losses have included multiple examples of the Kamov Ka-52 and Mil Mi-28N.”</em><em></em></p>



<p><em>Ukraine:&nbsp;</em><em></em></p>



<p><em>Tanks: One estimate indicates about one-third of the losses sustained by Russia – so approx. 1,000</em></p>



<p><em>Helicopters: Wikipedia lists 61, of which 16 Mil 24/35 and 39 Mil 8/17</em><em></em></p>



<p><strong>Armour operations</strong></p>



<p>Typical Western doctrine (offensive or defensive) uses manned armoured reconnaissance ahead of the Forward Line of Own Troops (FLOT) to locate enemy forces and determine their intentions. Increasingly, manned operations will be supported by other ISR, such as UAVs and later UGVs, to augment the manned platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Recce: </strong>This is driven by a recce Plan determined by the Commander’s Critical Information Requirements (CCIRs), designed to fill in gaps in intelligence and distinguish enemy feints and deception tactics from their main force’s true intentions and timing. Other objectives would typically be to locate enemy command and control, logistics, air defence units, long-range artillery, and other high-value/high-threat components.</p>



<p>The recce info will then shape the deployment of main armour and infantry (again offensive or defensive), supporting anti-armour helicopter and precision long-range artillery operations.</p>



<p>Manned armoured reconnaissance beyond the FLOT (i.e., in enemy territory) is likely hazardous, particularly if the enemy has effective electronic surveillance capabilities. Traffic analysis can be used to locate signal traffic from unknown forces and, even if encrypted, is likely to result in unwelcome attention. The US tends to assume its comms cannot be read, so it reports every enemy observation. The UK is more concerned about detected transmissions (even if not read) and operates largely under radio silence.</p>



<p>Terrain masking to avoid detection may make VHF traffic difficult, so HF or datalink to SATCOMs may have to be used.</p>



<p><strong>Armour and Mechanised Infantry: </strong>In addition, armour, on both sides, is having a hard time. In the Ukraine case, the threat has proven to be a combination of precision artillery and long-range missile attack, combined with top attack by armed drones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The author identified this latter threat as a concern more than a dozen years ago – having noted that Hezbollah, in the first Lebanon conflict, had deployed armed drones against Israeli armour.</p>



<p>Because the high mass of protective armour leads to weight and mobility issues, MBT protection is concentrated against direct fire attacks from other MBTs. Top protection is typically reduced, primarily against artillery near misses rather than direct hits, which are now the norm. Even with these measures, deployed MBT mass is typically around 62 tonnes, and top protection is one area that is typically traded off to achieve acceptable mobility.</p>

<p>Active protection systems are not yet regarded as mature and may introduce hazards to nearby personnel (if operating with infantry, for example). I am unsure how successful these are in Israeli use, or whether they have been used successfully in Ukraine. </p>



<p>Furthermore, Western armour generally has no organic means of detecting or countering the drone threat, although directed energy weapons or RF countermeasures may offer some capability in the future and are undoubtedly being actively researched and trialled.</p>



<p>So heavy armour is looking increasingly vulnerable, as, in the Ukrainian conflict at least, attack helicopters. However, heavy armour is clearly still important for taking and holding ground, so it will most likely continue to be central in many operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Attack Helicopter operations</strong></p>

<p>When the UK was developing its thinking for GST3971 to acquire a dedicated attack helicopter in the mid-1980s, the vision was of a helicopter that could engage in autonomous direct-fire attack of heavy armour. The threat was essentially Cold War, with massed Soviet armour operating across the North German Plain. Organic air defence (then primarily radar-directed ZSU-23-4) was a significant threat, leading to a desire to stand-off outside its lethal range. Priority targets were enemy air defence, command and control centres and heavy armour.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="47984" data-permalink="https://hushkit.net/2024/10/07/is-the-attack-helicopter-dead/image-317/" data-orig-file="https://hushkit.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-19.png" data-orig-size="6116,4077" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://hushkit.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-19.png?w=830" data-large-file="https://hushkit.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-19.png?w=830" tabindex="0" role="button" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://hushkit.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-19.png?w=1024" alt=""></figure>



<p>The solution was deemed to be a low-signature helicopter (radar and IR signatures, particularly) fitted with a mast-mounted sight and using terrain screening. A long-range fire-and-forget weapon was required so that the helicopter would not be exposed throughout the weapon’s flight time.</p>



<p>Initially, Apache was not favoured because the AH-64A was regarded as having large visual and radar signatures and an inadequate sighting system. Without a mast-mounted sight, Scout helicopter support would also be required for target acquisition and designation.</p>



<p>The AH-64D with Longbow and RF Hellfire largely solved these problems by acquiring targets at long range and engaging in indirect fire. However, the missile and target detection range exceeded the recognition and identification range of the TADS sight (which also required the helicopter to be exposed to gain a line of sight to the target). This introduced some concern about the ability to achieve positive target identification when operating under restrictive rules of engagement.</p>



<p><strong>The Situation in Ukraine</strong></p>



<p><strong>Russian operations over Ukrainian-held territory</strong></p>



<p>Today, taking the Ukraine experience as representative, Russian attack helicopters are operating over large regions of Ukrainian-held territory without air superiority and with a dispersed infantry threat armed with capable MANPADS systems. The defending forces can adopt positions that are well hidden, but which offer good fields of fire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The difficulty of detecting and countering this threat, combined with extensive areas lacking terrain cover, significantly increases the risk to attack helicopters in transit to and from their targets. This is compounded by the apparent ineffectiveness of the helicopter protection and countermeasures equipment.</p>



<p>There are reports of both sides in Ukraine using armed drones for anti-personnel operations against individual soldiers, so operation under cover, if not actually below ground is becoming necessary, if there are enemy drones in the area. This undoubtedly reduces the opportunities for, or increases the risk of, MANPADS operation.</p>



<p><strong>Ukraine perspective – early phase</strong></p>



<p>In the early phase of the invasion there was an armoured attack along the borders, but particularly moving south towards Kyiv from Belarus. This was largely canalised along main routes, as were its supporting logistic columns. This resulted in heavy losses. These were inflicted mainly by mines and artillery. Flooding of off-road terrain reduced the transit route options for the invading force.</p>

<p><strong>Later Developments</strong></p>



<p>After the pushing back of the initial armour thrust, Russian armour and mechanised infantry have been grinding out attacks from Ukraine’s borders, particularly from the south and east.&nbsp;This relatively static land battle is accompanied by long-range missile attacks on critical infrastructure and centres of population.</p>



<p>Both sides have effective anti-aircraft missile systems, and neither side has achieved full air superiority over the battlefield. The later Russian attack has featured the use of medium- to long-range stand-off weapons (cruise or ballistic missiles and glide bombs), air-or ground-launched, often from within Russian territory. There seems little scope to counter this, while the political does not exist to mount attacks on launch locations well into Russian territory. The best possible missile defence system may ameliorate damage but will not hasten the end of the conflict, which has become strategic rather than tactical.</p>



<p>Significant numbers of western ground-to-air missile systems are also being supplied. Ukrainian anti-armour operations have increasingly been able to use precision artillery such as HIMARS and ATACMS. The availability of such systems and their munitions is likely to be in short supply and is dependent on enduring political support from EU and NATO countries. It is, therefore, vulnerable, for example, should Donald Trump be returned as US President following the November election.</p>



<p>It seems likely that NATO surveillance assets (E-3, RC-135W, U-2S and satellite cover) are gathering real time intelligence over the battlefield – whether such information is being passed to inform Ukraine deployments and targeting decisions has not been revealed. In any future conflict, using such overhead assets and effective datalinks to transmit near real-time intelligence is likely to be key to effective offensive or defensive operations.</p>



<p>Both Russia and the Ukraine have adopted the use of armed drones for the top attack of armour and these appear to have been very successful. (Relatively little imagery has been released showing Ukraine anti-armour helicopter attacks on Russian armour, or indeed Russian helicopter attacks on Ukrainian armour – Western or otherwise).</p>



<p>NATO nations are beginning to supply air-to-ground weapons such as Brimstone and Storm Shadow, and F-16 aircraft have entered Ukrainian service. It is not known whether Western air-to-ground missiles have been integrated for release from existing Russian-built equipment operating with the Ukrainian Air Force.</p>



<p><strong>Suggested Success Factors for Helicopter anti-armour operations</strong></p>

<p>What do you need for successful helicopter anti-armour missions? Ideally, you want air superiority and not to operate over large swathes of enemy-held territory occupied by determined resistance, equipped with capable MANPADS and other air defence systems such as S-200 and S-300.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is a list of possible success factors for postulated helicopter anti-armour operations.</p>



<ul>
<li>Accurate intelligence as to disposition and movement of enemy armour: satellite, aerial recce, stand-off radar, comms / SIGINT, manned armoured reconnaissance, SF, etc.</li>



<li>A command and control infrastructure capable of providing updated target information in near real-time</li>



<li>Ability to comply with restrictive rules of engagement when necessary</li>



<li>Preferably having air superiority over the area of operations</li>



<li>Ability to reach an engagement position with minimal exposure to threat systems</li>



<li>Ability to engage at long-range</li>



<li>The necessity of avoiding enemy drone threats to AH is likely to favour mobile rather than static operation.</li>



<li>Carriage of sufficient weapons to inflict significant attrition on the enemy force (likely to determine the number of helicopters in the attack)</li>



<li>Use of longer-range missiles (Rafael Spike NLOS quotes 27 km range, helicopter-launched Brimstone is said to have similar range capability).</li>



<li>Proven and effective countermeasures against unexpected missile attack – missile launch detection and tracking, plus sophisticated countermeasures and effective signature reduction. Today, there must<em> be some query as to the availability and effectiveness of such systems.</em></li>



<li>Ballistic tolerance at least against small arms and medium machine gun threats</li>



<li>Reliable, low-maintenance platform, capable of operation in all weather and climatic conditions.</li>



<li>Crashworthy fuel systems</li>



<li>Run-dry transmission systems</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Defensive Operations</strong></p>



<p>The above factors suggest that deploying attack helicopters operating defensively (over one’s territory) could still be effective.</p>



<p>If the enemy uses the same or similar equipment, there would still be problems to solve regarding positive target ID. Also, effective command and control to deal with a fluid ground situation could be problematic, as could maintaining a supply of munitions to the AH force. Missile countermeasures remain an uncertain problem.</p>



<p><strong>Offensive Operations</strong></p>



<p>Long-range indirect fire engagements would be preferred for both offensive and defensive operations—and probably essential in the offensive case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The high helicopter losses sustained by Russia in current offensive operations probably reflect high risk operations, in the face of determined opposition with capable weapons and not much terrain cover for the helicopters. Also, no air superiority to provide top cover and hinder ground air defence, together with apparently ineffective measures to hinder missile lock-on and to break lock, once engaged.</p>

<p>Moreover, the threat is not the organic air defences of battlegroups or a Soviet Motor-Rifle Regiment or Brigade but dispersed and well-hidden infantry and special forces units equipped with modern MANPADS missile systems. Furthermore, because the enemy forces are operating over the defenders’ own ground, the defence can be cued and alerted to approaching helicopters, given good data connectivity.</p>



<p>In the case of offensive operations, it would appear that stand-off operations from the ground already held by one’s own forces might be the order of the day. In this case, the helicopters might operate similarly to a highly mobile precision artillery unit, able to redeploy kilometres across the field of operations in minutes. With a lack of local air superiority, the Russian use of stand-off weapons launched from within their territory supports this proposition.</p>







<p>A further consideration is that maintaining the mobility of the helicopter force is likely to benefit it by hampering any drone threat targeted at it.</p>



<p>The focus of attack might shift towards enemy logistics – MBTs without fuel or ammunition cannot conduct manoeuvre warfare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Increasing the range at which the attack is conducted could suggest the use of larger helicopters to carry the heavier weapons likely to be required – feasible if operating over safe ground. The carriage of Exocet on certain export Sea King aircraft is an example of such a usage. Rafael Spike and Brimstone are also attracting interest because of their long-range capability. Clearly, target selection would be entirely dependent on the higher-level ISTAR infrastructure, although salvo-fired Brimstone has already shown some autonomous target discrimination capability.</p>



<p>An alternative to using one heavy long-range missile per tank destroyed might be to use a larger helicopter to launch long-range drone-carrying systems. This could allow several medium helicopters to launch attack and surveillance drones into a given operational area, possibly in the enemy’s rear. Command and control, logistics, comms, armour, barracks, and hardened targets could all be engaged in this way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forward-launched recce drones could provide target designation and satisfy positive ID requirements when operating under tight rules of engagement.</p>



<p>Such an approach could also overload the enemy air defence command and control and be usefully deployed in conjunction with simultaneous missile and/or manned aircraft operations.</p>



<p>This capability is alluded to in several planned US programmes, including the abandoned FARA and FLRAA. We are talking about air-launched effects (LE) for reconnaissance or attack and Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems. The air-launched effects were described (Vertiflite March / April 2024) as being deployed from FARA, FLRAA and Black Hawk “to decoy, disrupt or destroy enemy air defences and to spot targets for joint forces”. The same article indicates that ”the Army plans first flight of a fully-integrated ALTIUS – Air-Launched, Tube Integrated Unmanned System from a Black Hawk this year” potentially for a rapid fielding decision in 2025.</p>



<p>Associated with this is the US’s ”long-standing interest in technologies that enable a single operator to control multiple UAS.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Perhaps network-enabled command and control, ISTAR, and other means of target verification can integrate existing AH capability in defensive operations. Medium helicopters operating further back could launch a mix of longer-range weapons and ‘Launched effect UAS’ in both offensive and defensive scenarios.</p>



<p>Further to the suggestion of stand-off medium helicopters for anti-armour ops over enemy territory (and the US reference to Air Launched Effects), see this link: <a href="https://www.thinkdefence.co.uk/2022/06/tube-launched-uas/&amp;nbsp" rel="nofollow">https://www.thinkdefence.co.uk/2022/06/tube-launched-uas/&amp;nbsp</a>;</p>



<p>It is also worth noting that Sea King was cleared for export customers to launch Sea Eagle (India) and Exocet (Qatar, Pakistan), suggesting plenty of payload for air-launched systems controlled by medium support helicopters. [A good role for the FAA Merlin Mk.4 force?]</p>

<p><strong>The Drone Threat to Helicopters</strong></p>



<p>In a traditional mechanised offensive, armour and infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) operate collectively to gain and hold ground. Helicopters are used forward to take out enemy armour and attack command posts while scouting and designating targets for precision artillery strikes.</p>



<p>Infantry also relies on helicopter support for air cover and casevac. Recently, drones have been used in kamikaze attacks on helicopters. Used in this way, drones could significantly hamper helicopter operations and severely affect infantry morale.</p>



<p>Both helicopters and ground vehicles now need to adopt design and protection / defensive measures cognisant of the drone threat. In this scenario, the twin tail rotors suggested on some Westland designs (admittedly for other purposes) could provide a degree of redundancy.</p>



<p><strong>General Observations</strong></p>



<p>As the earlier discussion shows, the systems are more important than the platform. Ideally, you want to be network-enabled (so that someone else sorts out the targets and satisfies the rules of engagement). Then you want a long-range fire-and-forget weapon system capable of defeating enemy countermeasures and with a tandem charge, warhead to deal with ERA. If the missile sensor can discriminate between target types, so much the better. If I were in a tank, I’d still be worried about drones – as I said in a briefing a dozen years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Given the right network integration and the right weapons, you could inflict a deal of pain in a fairly basic helicopter while staying well out of the way of any air defence. You still have to protect yourself against chance encounters – partisans or special forces with shoulder-launched weapons, for example. This appears easier said than done.</p>



<p>Assuming conditions allow offensive aircraft operations, integrating western weapon systems such as Brimstone on suitable platforms, such as Frogfoot, could provide the ability to salvo fire against multiple targets. Its MMW radar seeker is supposed to support this capability, with the weapons themselves avoiding duplication of effort and allocating targets across the salvo (fire-and-forget en masse).</p>

<p>The capacity offered by a medium helicopter in this role could extend to&nbsp;area denial or countermobility operations. This type of platform might be used to deliver area denial or scatterable countermeasures (even mines, perhaps) to rapidly counter enemy armour. Missiles such as Brimstone might be more effectively employed in this scenario.</p>



<p>Whether in a defensive or offensive posture, an agile and responsive command and control system will be required to maintain a responsive decision-making process. This is known as the OODA-loop (OODA stands for observe, orient, decide, act). There is some question as to whether current NATO surveillance assets are providing near-real time intelligence to Ukraine. It is clear, however, that long-range stand-off anti-armour operations will require a persistent (probably stealthy) high-flying or stand-off system to provide situation awareness, detect armour targets across the battlefield and enable the use of precision indirect fires (whether by artillery or helicopter, operations).</p>

<p><em>One very good use case for low or zero sensors but good comms is to have airborne nodes in a ‘scrum half’ position behind the tactical edge. Anything up threat (exquisite and LO) can use directional comms to get data back / receive C2 and Intel from the nodes; the nodes then use any route to get to the optimal place – including space and terrestrial – from a position that cannot be easily targeted by OPFOR.</em></p>



<p><em>Urgent Operational Requirements manage rapid change during conflict, usually in response to painful lessons learned. This is generally at the subsystem/protection level rather than the system and platform level. Examples could be the rapid introduction of electronic countermeasures, protective screens, and responses to enemy countermeasures.</em> The targeting infrastructure required to support helicopter indirect fire long-range attacks appears a little different from that required to support MLRS / HIMARS / ATACMS operations and should, therefore, be available, provided suitable tasking orders can be accommodated.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the available description of the Leonardo AW249 mentions the ability to operate air-launched RPVs. The latest Aerospace magazine indicates more on its network capability: “acts as a sensor ISR node on a C4 network, and (can) control and manage UAVs – with a Wide Band LOS Datalink … LTE Gateway and Link 16.” The articles do not address the routine concept of operations, but the connectivity and network capabilities could allow a range of collaborating systems to provide targeting data. Now they just need to adapt AW149 and/or NH90 TTH to the stand-off anti-armour role …</p>



<p><strong>Tentative Conclusions</strong></p>



<p>There are many problems facing armoured units in modern land warfare. Broadly, these fall into (1) threats: enemy armour, helicopters, armed drones, precision artillery and missiles, minefields and obstacles; and (2) the difficulty of sustaining operations over time at long range: logistics – fuel, ammunition, repair, crew sustainment, rules of engagement.</p>



<p>Similarly, one can discuss the problems facing the counter-armour forces – again dependent on terrain/area of operations, posture, equipment and C4ISTAR systems and their connectivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operational changes may arise under TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) rather than wholesale doctrinal revisions. The challenge is to inflict heavy casualties on enemy forces while increasing one’s own chances of survival.</p>



<p>Used carefully, existing attack helicopters operating over ‘friendly’ terrain can still be effective. Increased use of ‘network-enabled warfare’ seems essential, combined with the ability to engage targets primarily at range and preferably non-line-of-sight.</p>

<p>You might end up with some new operational concepts and the reprioritisation of target lists.&nbsp; Flooding of land to ‘canalise’ (literally and metaphorically) the routes available to armour (and logistics); out-of-contact launching and controlling of recce/designator / armed drones – and longer-range missiles from medium helicopters looks like a decent tactic for anti-armour operations and may have a place in both defensive and offensive postures.</p>

<p>Brimstone 2 (helicopter launched) has a stated range of 40 km+. As an operational concept,&nbsp; half a dozen AW149s (or NH90s, or Merlins, or Sea Kings), each with eight Brimstone 2, could do a lot of damage providing indirect fire – provided near real-time networked stand-off target information was available. The helicopter fleet operates as a highly mobile precision artillery force in this role.</p>



<p>Exploitation of night capability and simultaneous attacks along a front might come into play. Deep strikes into enemy training and rear areas (and recruitment centres) might also be targeted to affect public opinion and morale. </p>

<p>Other options could include using dummy armour supported by signals deception activity to draw in enemy forces or distract from more covert operations.</p>

<p>Finally, it would appear that heavy armour forces do need organic close-in air defence. Perhaps the naval approach (e.g., Phalanx)—whether by high rate-of-fire radar-directed gun systems, electronic countermeasures (potentially including EMP to disrupt connectivity of control systems), or directed energy means—might go a good way to countering the ‘kamikaze drone’ threat. Target detection and tracking systems would have to be modified to suit the targets to be engaged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The low cost and simplicity of the drones means that they have a significant numbers advantage and identifying and then defeating drones once in air is hard; their low profile and low signature is a challenge and their agility makes physical defeat hard. This strongly favours electronic countermeasures might be the preferred approach.</p>

<p>The discussion suggests that intelligence, communications, and the ability to counter enemy operations are becoming dominant factors in future land warfare. Land platforms and helicopters should now be designed considering enemy drone operations as a key threat.</p>



<p>Equally, friendly drone operations – offensive, defensive, intelligence gathering, defence suppression, etc. —should be integrated into and with operational planning and land and air platform capabilities.</p>

Google</em></a>, ordering Google to effectively open up the Google Play app store to competition for three whole years. Google will have to distribute rival third-party app stores<em> within </em>Google Play, and it must give rival third-party app stores access to the full catalog of Google Play apps, unless developers opt out individually. </p><p>These were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24128531/epic-google-proposed-injunction-remedies">Epic’s biggest asks</a>, and they might change the Android app marketplace forever — if they aren’t immediately paused or blocked on appeal. </p><p>And they’re not all that Epic has won today.</p><p>Starting November 1st, 2024, and ending November 1st, 2027, Google must also:</p><div><ul><li>Stop requiring Google Play Billing for apps distributed on the Google Play Store (the jury found that Google had illegally tied its payment system to its app store)</li><li>Let Android developers tell users about other ways to pay from within the Play Store</li><li>Let Android developers link to ways to download their apps outside of the Play Store</li><li>Let Android developers set their own prices for apps irrespective of Play Billing</li></ul></div><p>Google also can’t: </p><div><ul><li>Share app revenue “with any person or entity that distributes Android apps” or plans to launch an app store or app platform</li><li>Offer developers money or perks to launch their apps on the Play Store exclusively or first</li><li>Offer developers money or perks <strong>not</strong> to launch their apps on rival stores</li><li>Offer device makers or carriers money or perks to preinstall the Play Store</li><li>Offer device makers or carriers money or perks <strong>not </strong>to preinstall rival stores</li></ul></div><p>In <em>Epic v. Google</em>,<em> </em>Epic successfully argued that Google had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap">created such a substantial array of deals with developers, carriers, and device makers</a> that it was nigh-impossible for rival stores to spring up. By blocking those sorts of deals, and proactively helping rival app stores, it’s possible some real competition to Google’s monopoly could now arrive.</p><p>Google will still have some control over safety and security as it opens up the Google Play Store to rival stores. The injunction says that Google can “take reasonable measures” that are “strictly necessary and narrowly tailored” and are “comparable” to how it currently polices the Google Play Store. Google will be able to charge a fee for that policing, too. Epic has repeatedly argued that Google should not be able to deter third-party app stores through policing, so it’s likely Epic and Google will keep butting heads over this.</p><p>Judge Donato is giving Google eight months from now to come up with a system, with a three-person technical committee jointly chosen by Epic and Google reviewing any disputes. That system will also come with a way for developers to opt out of being listed in rival Android app stores.</p><p>Epic didn’t quite get everything it asked for: it wanted the judge to crack open Google Play for six years, not three; allow users to sideload apps with a single tap; and for Google to stop being able to tie Android APIs to Google Play. </p><p>Why not six years? “The provisions are designed to level the playing field for the entry and growth of rivals, without burdening Google excessively,” writes Donato in his order. “As competition comes into play and the network effects that Google Play unfairly enjoys are abated, Google should not be unduly constrained as a competitor.”</p><p>Yet Amazon, of all companies, convinced Judge Donato that Google’s rivals need a helping hand. “Even a corporate behemoth like Amazon could not compete with the Google Play Store due to network effects,” writes Donato, citing a key piece of evidence from the trial: an internal Google presentation that suggested Amazon would struggle with the chicken-and-egg problem of attracting both users and apps. To date, the Amazon Appstore has not become a substantial competitor.</p><p>But with access to the Google Play catalog of apps, Donato argues, rival app stores will now have “a fighting chance of getting off the ground”.</p><p>Epic Games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal">originally sued Google</a> on August 13th, 2020 — the very same day it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief">sued Apple, too</a>. The game developer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368651/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-ban-lawsuit-epic-games-payments">sprung a premeditated trap</a> on both tech giants by attempting to bypass their 30 percent fee on in-app purchases with a surprise update to its mega-popular game <em>Fortnite. </em>Both tech companies retaliated by kicking <em>Fortnite</em> off their app stores, only to be met by a coordinated #FreeFortnite action campaign and a pair of lawsuits accusing each of creating illegal monopolies.</p><p>The Apple case is already over, and Apple mostly won: the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24039983/supreme-court-epic-apple-antitrust-case-rejected">Supreme Court rejected Epic’s final appeal</a> this January. The only thing Epic legally achieved there was an order dismantling Apple’s “anti-steering rules,” theoretically letting developers freely tell their customers how to bypass Apple’s payment systems. (I won’t discuss the Apple case more than this brief outline since I’m&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister/archives/38#:~:text=Ethics%20statement%2C%20June%202023%3A">ethically bound</a>.)</p><p>But the Google case took far longer to kick off, and it went very differently. I spent 15 days reporting live from the courtroom, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap">I saw Epic show time and again</a> that Google was running scared, didn’t treat developers equally, and had something to hide. </p><p>The jury in <em>Epic v. Google</em> was thoroughly convinced: last December, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23994174/epic-google-trial-jury-verdict-monopoly-google-play">it reached the unanimous verdict</a> that the Google Play app store and Google Play Billing service were an illegal monopoly and that many of the special deals it made with game developers and phone manufacturers were anticompetitive behavior.</p><div><p>“We’re going to tear the barriers down”</p></div><p>In August, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220491/epic-google-android-app-store-monopoly-remedies-hearing">Judge Donato warned</a> that Google would pay for its behavior. “We’re going to tear the barriers down, it’s just the way it’s going to happen,” he said. In remedy hearings, he rejected Google’s suggestions that meeting Epic’s demands would take too much work, cost too much money, or were impossible to arrange without taking substantial time.</p><p>It’s not yet clear whether Google will have to immediately follow the court’s demands, even though the permanent injunction will take effect November 1st. Google already promised to appeal the verdict, and it’s now apparently looking for an immediate stay — Google says it will ask to “<a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/">pause Epic’s requested changes” in this new blog post today</a>. </p><p>Like Apple, Google now hopes the appeals court will press pause on Judge Donato’s order while it tries its luck again. Apple spent years <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/9/23826043/epic-apple-app-store-supreme-court-petition">delaying the anti-steering rules change</a> with its legal appeals.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/9/30/24256395/epic-sues-google-samsung-antitrust-auto-blocker">Epic filed a second lawsuit against Google (and Samsung)</a> one week ago, arguing the companies were already attempting to sidestep this upcoming injunction by adding additional friction for third-party app stores. Since that case is now officially related to this one, Judge Donato will be hearing it as well.</p><p>Epic didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. </p></div></div>]]></description>

            <link>https://wasmer.io/posts/clang-in-browser</link>
            <guid>41767644</guid>
            <pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2024 16:24:32 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://wasmer.io/posts/clang-in-browser">https://wasmer.io/posts/clang-in-browser</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41767644">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’ve reached a major milestone in making any software run with WebAssembly.
Thanks to the newest release of Wasmer (4.4) and the Wasmer JS SDK (0.8.0) you can now run clang anywhere Wasmer runs!</p>
<p>This allows compiling C programs from virtually anywhere. Including Javascript and your preferred browser! (we tested Chrome, Safari and Firefox and everything is working like a charm).</p>
<p>For those eager to see it in action, head over to <a href="http://wasmer.sh/">wasmer.sh</a> to try a live demo (note: it requires a 100MB download):</p>
<pre><code># NOTE: this will download the clang package (100Mb), so it might take a while...
wasmer run clang/clang example.c -o example.wasm
wasmer run example.wasm
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: we <a href="https://x.com/wasmerio/status/1234903250249273344?lang=en">attempted running clang</a> few years ago, but because of WASI limitations we were unable to call <code>posix_spawn</code> which limited the usage and usability of clang in the browser, Firefox and Safari were not supported by then but are fully supported now.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Why is running <code>clang</code> with Wasmer useful, what use cases will enable?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can compile C code to WebAssembly easily just using the <code>wasmer</code> CLI: no toolchains or complex installations needed, install Wasmer and you are ready to go!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://wasix.org/">WASIX</a> is now self-hosted meaning it can compile itself and any C programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can compile C projects directly from JavaScript! (Continue reading to learn how to use <code>clang</code> with the Wasmer JS SDK.)</p>
<p>We expect online IDEs to start adopting the SDK to allow their users compile and run C programs in the browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reproducible builds</strong> anywhere (using the same version of Wasmer)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Enough with the tech talk—let’s see a demo!</p>
<p>Create a <code>donut.c</code> file with the following content (example taken from the awesome <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html">Donut Math</a>):</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

             k;double sin()
         ,cos();main(){float A=
       0,B=0,i,j,z[1760];char b[
     1760];printf("\x1b[2J");for(;;
  ){memset(b,32,1760);memset(z,0,7040)
  ;for(j=0;6.28&gt;j;j+=0.07)for(i=0;6.28
 &gt;i;i+=0.02){float c=sin(i),d=cos(j),e=
 sin(A),f=sin(j),g=cos(A),h=d+2,D=1/(c*
 h*e+f*g+5),l=cos      (i),m=cos(B),n=s\
in(B),t=c*h*g-f*        e;int x=40+30*D*
(l*h*m-t*n),y=            12+15*D*(l*h*n
+t*m),o=x+80*y,          N=8*((f*e-c*d*g
 )*m-c*d*e-f*g-l        *d*n);if(22&gt;y&amp;&amp;
 y&gt;0&amp;&amp;x&gt;0&amp;&amp;80&gt;x&amp;&amp;D&gt;z[o]){z[o]=D;;;b[o]=
 ".,-~:;=!*#$@"[N&gt;0?N:0];}}/*#****!!-*/
  printf("\x1b[H");for(k=0;1761&gt;k;k++)
   putchar(k%80?b[k]:10);A+=0.04;B+=
     0.02;}}/*****####*******!!=;:~
       ~::==!!!**********!!!==::-
         .,~~;;;========;;;:~-.
             ..,--------,*/
</code></pre>
<p>We can run clang with Wasmer and compile it to WASI and WASIX (<em>just make sure <a href="https://docs.wasmer.io/install">you have Wasmer installed locally</a>!</em>):</p>
<pre><code>$ wasmer run clang/clang --dir=. -- -Wno-implicit-int donut.c -o donut.wasm
$ wasmer run donut.wasm
</code></pre>
<p>To run clang on your browser, you can try the following on <a href="https://wasmer.sh/">wasmer.sh</a> (we added <code>donut.c</code> to the <code>/home</code> dir so it’s easier to try):</p>
<pre><code>wasmer run clang/clang -Wno-implicit-int donut.c -o donut.wasm
wasmer run /home/donut.wasm
</code></pre>
<p>The exciting news is that the clang package can compile, not just the donut c example, but any <a href="https://github.com/wasix-org/wasix-libc/blob/main/examples">complicated examples</a> from WASIX.</p>
<p>And more importantly… it works fully in the browser! (and also via the Wasmer Javascript SDK, read below to check the example of how to run clang in any of your Javascript projects!)</p>
<p><img src="https://wasmer.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.wasmer.io%2Fimages%2Fclang-donut.original.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75" alt="Donut compiled to Wasm in the browser"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: the <code>clang/clang</code> package currently weights about 100Mb uncompressed (as it requires the clang binaries + the system libraries). We are working on reducing the size and also serving it in compressed format. So ideally you should just need to download ~30Mb to use clang with Wasmer: either in your local shell, in your browser or in your Javascript project!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Javascript SDK usage</h2>
<p>Do you want to use <code>clang</code> in your Javascript project? Thanks to our newly released <a href="http://wasmer.io/posts/introducing-wasmer-js-wdk">Wasmer JS</a> SDK you can do it easily, in both the browser and Node.js/Bun etc:</p>
<pre><code>
import {
  init,
  Wasmer,
  Directory
} from "https://unpkg.com/@wasmer/sdk@latest/dist/index.mjs";

await init();

const clang = await Wasmer.fromRegistry("clang/clang");
const project = new Directory();
await project.writeFile("example.c",
`#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
  printf("Hello World");
  return 0;
}
`);

let instance = await clang.entrypoint.run({
  args: ["/project/example.c", "-o", "/project/example.wasm"],
  mount: { "/project": project },
});
const output = await instance.wait();

if (!output.ok) {
  throw new Error(`Clang failed. Exit: ${output.code}:`);
}

// The generated wasm file from clang
let wasm = await project.readFile("example.wasm");

const example = await Wasmer.fromFile(wasm);
const result = await example.entrypoint.run();
const outputExample = await result.wait();

// This should be "Hello World"
console.log(outputExample.stdout);
</code></pre>
<p>You can find a working <code>index.html</code> file executing clang: <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-js/blob/main/examples/clang-cdn/index.html">https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-js/blob/main/examples/clang-cdn/index.html</a></p>
<h3>One last thing! 🪄</h3>
<p>Wasmer’s clang can even <strong>optimize the file for you automatically</strong> using <code>wasm-opt</code> under the hood (Clang automatically detects if <code>wasm-opt</code> is used, and it will be automatically called when optimizing the file)</p>
<pre><code>wasmer run clang/clang --use wasmer/wasm-opt --dir=. -- -o example.wasm -O2
</code></pre>
<p>Imagine using Emscripten without needing its toolchain installed—or even better, imagine running Emscripten in the browser. We've made this possible thanks to the <a href="https://wasix.org/"><strong>WASIX</strong></a> ecosystem 🎉.</p>
<h2>What’s coming next</h2>
<p>We are incredibly excited for this milestone, as it opens the door for many upcoming features that we are going to need in Wasmer and Wasmer Edge:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Compiling <strong>native Python libraries</strong> directly from within WASIX. Imagine being able to have PIP compiling things in Wasm upon install, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>wasmer run python --entrypoint pip -- install numpy # This compiles numpy to WASIX, all within Wasmer processes
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using <strong><a href="https://wasmer.io/posts/py2wasm-a-python-to-wasm-compiler">py2wasm</a></strong> with a bundled compiler</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compiling <a href="https://medium.com/@elves.silva.vieira/javascript-achieves-breakthrough-performance-with-static-hermes-6286b0ac8ef7">Static Hermes</a> to WASIX, so we can generate native Wasm files from JS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New tooling? (any project depending on LLVM can now be easily compiled to WebAssembly!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the beginning of an awesome journey, we can't wait to see what you create next with this.</p>
<p>Feel free to give Wasmer a star if you liked the article or tell us how you are thinking on using the project:</p>

<p>If you’re worried your phone might be spying on you, sharing your data and location without you realizing, then a new report this week will make alarming reading.</p>

<p>“You can’t say no to Google’s surveillance,” the <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/google-pixel-9-phone-beams-data-and-awaits-commands/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://cybernews.com/security/google-pixel-9-phone-beams-data-and-awaits-commands/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://cybernews.com/security/google-pixel-9-phone-beams-data-and-awaits-commands/" aria-label="Cybernews"><em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://cybernews.com/security/google-pixel-9-phone-beams-data-and-awaits-commands/">Cybernews</em></a><em> </em>research team warns, describing a secretive stream of data they say continually transmits from a new phone to Google’s servers. Even more “concerning,” they say, “the phone periodically attempts to download and run new code, potentially opening up security risks.”</p>


<p>The <em>Cybernews</em> team took a “brand-new [Pixel 9 pro XL] with a new Google account and default settings” and rooted it to enable a man-in-the-middle data interception. The team “proxied the inbound and outbound traffic and used a custom security certificate to decrypt and examine the communications,” albeit rooting the phone disabled some features and so the intercepted data was not complete.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/10/04/new-update-warning-for-all-samsung-s24-ultra-s23-ultra-z-fold-6-z-flip-6-users/" target="_blank" aria-label="Samsung’s Update Decision—Bad News Confirmed For All Galaxy Phone Owners" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="forbesEmbedly:https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/10/04/new-update-warning-for-all-samsung-s24-ultra-s23-ultra-z-fold-6-z-flip-6-users/"><span><span>Forbes</span><span>Samsung’s Update Decision—Bad News Confirmed For All Galaxy Phone Owners</span><small>By <span>Zak Doffman</span></small></span><span><span></span></span></a></p>
<p>Because the testing took place with a new, default account, the team did not test to see the effect that user changes to privacy and security settings might have. But just as we’ve seen with browsers and apps—given most users maintain broadly default settings, it’s imperative those offer a good degree of out of the box protection.</p>

<p>“Every 15 minutes,” they say, the “Pixel 9 Pro XL sends a data packet to Google. The device shares location, email address, phone number, network status, and other telemetry.” This data, they found, is sent “to various Google endpoints, including Device Management, Policy Enforcement, and Face Grouping.”</p>

<p>There are clear sensitivities with contact details, device and network details, and other telemetry. But location data is especially sensitive, given the intrusive nature of such tracking data and the inferences this can provide about our lives.</p>
<figure role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion><p>Google’s data capture</p></fbs-accordion><small>Cybernews</small></figcaption></figure>


<p>We saw this sensitivity play out in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/06/07/google-location-tracking-on-android-and-iphone-ios-stops-in-180-days/" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/06/07/google-location-tracking-on-android-and-iphone-ios-stops-in-180-days/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/06/07/google-location-tracking-on-android-and-iphone-ios-stops-in-180-days/" aria-label="Google’s welcome move to stop collating user timelines from Google Maps">Google’s welcome move to stop collating user timelines from Google Maps</a> and instead maintain data on-device only. Worse, <em>Cybernews </em>says, “location data is included in the request even when GPS is disabled – the phone then relies on nearby Wi-Fi networks to estimate the location.”</p>
<p>There are multiple reasons why the collection of this data might be required to enable certain features, with <em>Cybernews</em> giving the example of the “newly introduced Car Crash Detection,” as one of these. There are also the diagnostic and services streams that flow from a device, and it’s unclear how this phone was setup. But the watchword is transparency and what users can reasonably be expected to know is taking place.</p>
<p><em>Cybernews</em> also raises the concern that communication takes place “with services the user didn’t explicitly consent to.” The example given is the Photos app, which they say they did not open nor take photos, but “the Pixel periodically contacted endpoints associated with Google Photos’ Face Grouping feature without asking for consent.”</p><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/10/04/microsoft-windows-10-windows-11-warning-3-days-to-update-or-stop-using-pc/" target="_blank" aria-label="Microsoft Windows ‘Critical Vulnerability’ Warning—You Have 72 Hours To Update Your PC" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="forbesEmbedly:https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/10/04/microsoft-windows-10-windows-11-warning-3-days-to-update-or-stop-using-pc/"><span><span>Forbes</span><span>Microsoft Windows ‘Critical Vulnerability’ Warning—You Have 72 Hours To Update Your PC</span><small>By <span>Zak Doffman</span></small></span><span><span></span></span></a></p><p>Beyond the location and other data collection, <em>Cybernews </em>also claims the device reached out to Google for new code to execute, opening up security risks. This security risk is much more of a stretch than than the data capture, and there is no evidence of any vulnerability to third-party code, especially with Play Protect enabled on the device. That said, one can never rule out the more sophisticated adversaries hijacking such openings for their own purposes.</p>
<p>The data egress is more tangible. The data <em>Cybernews</em> says it captured off-device, and the frequency with which that was being sent, certainly warrants some transparency. That said, this is a Google device in the hands of a user with a Google account, and there’s no suggestion any of this data was transmitted to any third-party. But given Google’s mixed record on privacy and data harvesting, users will likely have concerns. I have asked Google for their comments on the new report and its findings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the researchers warn that “the deep integration of surveillance systems in [Google’s] ecosystem may leave users vulnerable to privacy violations.” And while this test was specifically for the new Pixel Pro devices, it’s clearly a wider issue.</p>

<p>Well, I guess I missed the memo, because <a href="https://jakelazaroff.github.io/htmx-spa/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">I used htmx to build a single-page app</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://jakelazaroff.github.io/htmx-spa/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">  <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">htmx spa</span>  <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://jakelazaroff.github.io/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">jakelazaroff.github.io/htmx-spa/</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a>.</p>
<p>It’s a simple proof of concept todo list.
Once the page is loaded, there is <em>no additional communication with a server</em>.
Everything happens locally on the client.</p>
<p>How does that work, given that htmx is focused on managing hypermedia exchanges over the network?</p>
<p>With one simple trick:<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-clickbait" id="user-content-fnref-clickbait" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">1</a></sup> the “server-side” code runs in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">service worker</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Service Worker API - Web APIs | MDN</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Service workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, the browser, and the network (when available). They are intended, among other things, to enable the creation of effective offline experiences, intercept network requests, and take appropriate action based on whether the network is available, and update assets residing on the server. They will also allow access to push notifications and background sync APIs.</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a>.</p>
<p>Briefly, a service worker acts as a proxy between a webpage and the wider Internet.
It intercepts network requests and allows you to manipulate them.
You can alter requests, cache responses to be served offline or even create new responses out of whole cloth without ever sending the request beyond the browser.</p>
<p>That last capability is what powers this single-page app.
When htmx makes a network request, the service worker intercepts it.
The service worker then runs the business logic and generates new HTML, which htmx then swaps into the DOM.</p>
<p>There are a couple of advantages over a traditional single-page app built with something like React, too.
Service workers must use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">IndexedDB</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">IndexedDB API - Web APIs | MDN</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. This API uses indexes to enable high-performance searches of this data. While Web Storage is useful for storing smaller amounts of data, it is less useful for storing larger amounts of structured data. IndexedDB provides a solution. This is the main landing page for MDN's IndexedDB coverage — here we provide links to the full API reference and usage guides, browser support details, and some explanation of key concepts.</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a> for storage, which is stateful between page loads.
If you close the page and then come back, the app retains your data — this happens “for free”, a <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">pit of success</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/assets/images/codinghorror-app-icon.png?v=f6a88d682f" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Falling Into The Pit of Success</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Eric Lippert notes the perils of programming in C++:

The app also works offline, which doesn’t come for free but is pretty easy to add once the service worker is set up already.</p>
<p>Of course, service workers have a bunch of pitfalls as well.
One is the absolutely abysmal support in developer tools, which seem to intermittently swallow <code>console.log</code> and unreliably report when a service worker is installed.
Another is the lack of support for ES modules in Firefox, which forced me to put all my code (including a vendored version of <a href="https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb-keyval" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">IDB Keyval</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb-keyval" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://opengraph.githubassets.com/07f16bf35606046a6b0ae984536d6b4ffad2233d997114e353456a3b1973fe8b/jakearchibald/idb-keyval" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">GitHub - jakearchibald/idb-keyval: A super-simple-small promise-based keyval store implemented with IndexedDB</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">A super-simple-small promise-based keyval store implemented with IndexedDB - jakearchibald/idb-keyval</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">github.com/jakearchibald/idb-keyval</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a>, which I included because IndexedDB is similarly annoying) in a single file.</p>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list!
I would describe the general experience of working with service workers as “not fun”.</p>
<p>But!
In spite of all that, the htmx single-page app works.
Let’s dive in!</p>

<p>This should look familiar if you’ve ever built a single-page app: the empty husk of an HTML document, waiting to be filled in by JavaScript.
That long inline <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag just sets up the service worker and is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">mostly stolen from MDN</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Using Service Workers - Web APIs | MDN</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">This article provides information on getting started with service workers, including basic architecture, registering a service worker, the installation and activation process for a new service worker, updating your service worker, cache control and custom responses, all in the context of a simple app with offline functionality.</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a>.</p>
<p>The interesting bit here is the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag, which uses htmx to set up the meat of the app:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hx-boost="true"</code> tells htmx to use Ajax to swap in the responses of link clicks and form submissions without a full page navigation</li>
<li><code>hx-push-url="false"</code> prevents htmx from updating the URL in response to said link clicks and form submissions</li>
<li><code>hx-get="./ui"</code> tells htmx to load the page at <code>/ui</code> and swap it in</li>
<li><code>hx-target="body"</code> tells htmx to swap the results into the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element</li>
<li><code>hx-trigger="load"</code> tells htmx that it should do all this when the page loads</li>
</ul>
<p>So basically: <code>/ui</code> returns the actual markup for the app, at which point htmx takes over any links and forms to make it interactive.</p>
<p>What’s at <code>/ui</code>?
Enter the service worker!
It uses a small home-brewed Express-like “library” to handle boilerplate around routing requests and returning responses.
How that library actually works is beyond the scope of this post, but it’s used like this:</p>
<pre><code is:raw="">spa<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"/ui"</span><span>,</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>_request<span>,</span> <span>{</span> query <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>When a <code>GET</code> request is made to <code>/ui</code>, this code…</p>
<ol>
<li>grabs the query string for the filter</li>
<li>saves the filter in IndexedDB</li>
<li>tells htmx to update the URL accordingly</li>
<li>renders the <code>App</code> “component” to HTML with the active filter and list of todos</li>
<li>returns the rendered HTML to the browser</li>
</ol>
<p><code>setFilter</code> and <code>listTodos</code> are pretty simple functions that wrap IDB Keyval:</p>

<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>(As before, we’ll skip some of the utility functions like <code>html</code>, which just provides some small conveniences when interpolating values.)</p>
<p><code>App</code> can be broken down into roughly three sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>The filters form.
This renders a radio button for each filter.
When a radio button changes, it submits the form to <code>/ui</code>, which re-renders the app using the steps described above.
The<code>hx-boost</code> attribute from before intercepts the form submission and swaps the response back into the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> without refreshing the page.</li>
<li>The todos list.
This loops over all the todos matching the current filter, rendering each using the <code>Todo</code> component.</li>
<li>The add todo form.
This is a form with an input that submits the value to <code>/todos/add</code>.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-get" id="user-content-fnref-get" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">2</a></sup>
<code>hx-target=".todos"</code> tells htmx to replace an element on the page with class <code>todos</code>; <code>hx-select=".todos"</code> tells htmx that rather than using the <em>entire</em> response, it should just use an element with class <code>todos</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at that <code>/todos/add</code> route:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>addTodo</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Pretty simple!
It just saves the todo and returns a response with the re-rendered UI, which htmx thens swap into the DOM.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at that <code>Todo</code> component from before:</p>

    &lt;/li&gt;
  </span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>There are three main parts here: the checkbox, the delete button and the todo text.</p>
<p>First, the checkbox.
It triggers a <code>GET</code> request to <code>/todos/${id}/update</code> every time it’s checked or unchecked, with a query string <code>done</code> matching its current state; htmx swaps the full response into the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s the code for that route:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>updateTodo</span><span>(</span><span>id<span>,</span> <span>{</span> text<span>,</span> done <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>await</span> <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>"todos"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>todos <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    todos<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>todo</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span>todo<span>.</span>id <span>!==</span> id<span>)</span> <span>return</span> todo<span>;</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span>todo<span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>:</span> text <span>||</span> todo<span>.</span>text<span>,</span> <span>done</span><span>:</span> done <span>??</span> todo<span>.</span>done <span>}</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

spa<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"/todos/:id/update"</span><span>,</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>_request<span>,</span> <span>{</span> params<span>,</span> query <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>query<span>.</span>done<span>)</span> updates<span>.</span>done <span>=</span> query<span>.</span>done <span>===</span> <span>"true"</span><span>;</span>

  <span>await</span> <span>updateTodo</span><span>(</span>params<span>.</span>id<span>,</span> updates<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> html <span>=</span> <span>App</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>filter</span><span>:</span> <span>await</span> <span>getFilter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>todos</span><span>:</span> <span>await</span> <span>listTodos</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Response</span><span>(</span>html<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>(Notice that the route also supports changing the todo text. We’ll get to that in a minute.)</p>
<p>The delete button is even simpler: it makes a <code>DELETE</code> request to <code>/todos/${id}</code>.
As with the checkbox, htmx swaps the full response into the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s that route:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>deleteTodo</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>await</span> <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>"todos"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>todos <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> todos<span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>todo</span> <span>=&gt;</span> todo<span>.</span>id <span>!==</span> id<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

spa<span>.</span><span>delete</span><span>(</span><span>"/todos/:id"</span><span>,</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>_request<span>,</span> <span>{</span> params <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>await</span> <span>deleteTodo</span><span>(</span>params<span>.</span>id<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> html <span>=</span> <span>App</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>filter</span><span>:</span> <span>await</span> <span>getFilter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>todos</span><span>:</span> <span>await</span> <span>listTodos</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Response</span><span>(</span>html<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>The final part is the todo text, which is made more complicated by the support for editing the text.
There are two possible states: “normal”, which just displays a simple <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> with the todo text (I’m sorry that this isn’t accessible!) and “editing”, which displays an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> that allows the user to edit it.
The <code>Todo</code> component uses the <code>editing</code> “prop” to determine which state to render.</p>
<p>Unlike in a client-side framework like React, though, we can’t just toggle state somewhere and have it make the necessary DOM changes.
htmx makes a network request for the new UI, and we need to return a hypermedia response that it can then swap into the DOM.</p>
<p>Here’s the route:</p>
<pre><code is:raw=""><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getTodo</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> todos <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>listTodos</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> todos<span>.</span><span>find</span><span>(</span><span>todo</span> <span>=&gt;</span> todo<span>.</span>id <span>===</span> id<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

spa<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"/ui/todos/:id"</span><span>,</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>_request<span>,</span> <span>{</span> params<span>,</span> query <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> todo <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>getTodo</span><span>(</span>params<span>.</span>id<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>todo<span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Response</span><span>(</span><span>""</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>404</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> editable <span>=</span> query<span>.</span>editable <span>===</span> <span>"true"</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> html <span>=</span> <span>Todo</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>...</span>todo<span>,</span> editable <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Response</span><span>(</span>html<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>At a high level, the coordination between webpage and service worker looks something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>htmx listens for double-click events on todo text <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s</li>
<li>htmx makes a request to <code>/ui/todos/${id}?editable=true</code></li>
<li>The service worker returns the HTML for the <code>Todo</code> component that includes the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> rather than the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code></li>
<li>htmx swaps the current todo list item with the HTML from the response</li>
</ol>
<p>When the user changes the input, a similar process happens, calling the <code>/todos/${id}/update</code> endpoint instead and swapping the whole <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.
If you’ve used htmx, this should be a pretty familiar pattern.</p>
<p>That’s it!
We now have a single-page app built with htmx (and service workers) that doesn’t rely on a remote web server.

<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>So, this technically works.
Is it a good idea?
Is it the <em>apotheosis</em> of hypermedia-based applications?
Should we abandon React and build apps like this?</p>
<p>htmx works by adding indirection to the UI, loading new HTML from across a network boundary.
That can make sense in a client-server app, because it reduces indirection with regard to the <em>database</em> by colocating it with rendering.
On the other hand, the client-server story in a framework like React can be painful, requiring careful coordination between clients and servers via an awkward data exchange channel.</p>
<p>When all interactions are local, though, the rendering and data are <em>already</em> colocated (in memory) and updating them in tandem with a framework like React is easy and synchronous.
In this case, the indirection that htmx requires starts to feel more burdensome than liberatory.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-nojs" id="user-content-fnref-nojs" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">3</a></sup>
For fully local apps, I don’t think juice is worth the squeeze.</p>
<p>Of course, most apps aren’t <em>fully</em> local — usually, there’s a mix of local interactions and network requests.
My sense is that even in that case, <a href="https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/islands-architecture/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">islands of interactivity</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/islands-architecture/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/ddxwdqwkr/image/upload/f_auto/v1633286240/patterns.dev/islandsarchitecture.jpg" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Islands Architecture</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">The islands architecture encourages small, focused chunks of interactivity within server-rendered web pages</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://www.patterns.dev/img/favicon/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">www.patterns.dev/vanilla/islands-architecture/</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a> is a better pattern than splitting your “server-side” code between the service worker and the actual server.</p>
<p>In any event, this was mostly an exercise to see what it might look like to build a fully local single-page app using hypermedia, rather than imperative or functional programming.</p>
<p>Note that hypermedia is a technique rather than a specific tool.

Better still would be some sort of HyperCard-esque app in which you could build the whole thing visually.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="" height="1400" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2024/05/22/Chinese_hackers.png" width="2504"></p>
<p>Multiple U.S. broadband providers, including Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Lumen Technologies, have been breached by a Chinese hacking group tracked as Salt Typhoon, the Wall Street Journal reports.</p>
<p>The purpose of the attack appears to be for intelligence collection as the hackers might have had access to systems used by the U.S. federal government for court-authorized network wiretapping requests.</p>
<p>It is unclear when the intrusion occurred, but WSJ cites people familiar with the matter, saying that "for months or longer, the hackers might have held access to network infrastructure used to cooperate with lawful U.S. requests for communications data."</p>
<p>Salt Typhoon is the name that Microsoft gave to this particular China-based threat actor. Other cybersecurity companies are tracking the adversary as Earth Estries (Trend Micro), FamousSparrow (ESET), Ghost Emperor (Kaspersky), and UNC2286 (Mandiant, now part of Google Cloud).</p>
<h3>Capturing sensitive traffic</h3>
<p>According to the WSJ, the attack was discovered in recent weeks and is being investigated by the U.S. government and security experts in the private sector.</p>
<p>The impact of the attack&nbsp;- amount and type of observed and exfiltrated data - is still being assessed, people with information about the intrusion told WSJ.</p>
<p>“The hackers appear to have engaged in a vast collection of internet traffic from internet service providers that count businesses large and small, and millions of Americans, as their customers” - <a href="http://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/china-cyberattack-internet-providers-260bd835" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Wall Street Journal</a></p>
<p>Apart from breaching service providers in the U.S. Salt Typhoon may have hacked similar entities in other countries, too.</p>
<p>Salt Typhoon has been active since at least 2019 and is considered a sophisticated hacking group focusing on government entities and telecommunications companies typically in the Southeast Asia region.</p>
<p>Security researchers also found that the threat actor attacked hotels, engineering companies, and law firms in Brazil, Burkina Faso, South Africa, Canada, Israel, France, Guatemala, Lithuania, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The hackers usually obtain initial access to the target network by exploiting vulnerabilities, such as the <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/more-hacking-groups-join-microsoft-exchange-attack-frenzy/" target="_blank">ProxyLogon vulnerabilities</a> in Microsoft Exchange Server (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065).</p>
<p>In previous attacks attributed to Salt Typhoon/Ghost Emperor, the threat actor used a custom backdoor called <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/09/23/famoussparrow-suspicious-hotel-guest/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">SparrowDoor</a>, customized versions of the Mimikatz tool for extracting authentication data, and a Windows kernel-mode rootkit <a href="https://securelist.com/ghostemperor-from-proxylogon-to-kernel-mode/104407/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Demodex</a>.</p>
<p>Investigators are still looking for the initial access method for the recent attack. The WSJ says that one avenue being explored is gaining access to Cisco routers responsible for routing internet traffic.</p>
<p>However, a Cisco spokesperson told WSJ that the company was looking into the matter but had received no indication that Cisco networking equipment was involved in the breach.</p>
<p>BleepingComputer contacted AT&amp;T about the alleged breach and was told&nbsp;they "are not commenting on the WSJ report." Lumen also declined to comment.</p>
<p>Verizon has not responded to our emails, and we will&nbsp;update the story if we receive a reply.</p>
<p>Chinese APT hacking groups have been increasingly targeting U.S. and European networking devices and ISPs in cyberespionage attacks.</p>
<p>In August,&nbsp;cybersecurity researchers at Lumen's Black Lotus Labs disclosed that the Chinese threat actors known as "Volt Typhoon" exploited a zero-day flaw in Versa Director to steal credentials and breach corporate networks. During these attacks, the <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-volt-typhoon-hackers-exploited-versa-zero-day-to-breach-isps-msps/" target="_blank">threat actors breached multiple ISPs and MSPs</a> in the U.S. and India, which is not believed to be related to the recent breaches.</p>
<p>In September, Black Lotus Labs and law enforcement <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/flax-typhoon-hackers-infect-260-000-routers-ip-cameras-with-botnet-malware/" target="_blank">disrupted a massive Chinese botnet named "Raptor Train"</a> that compromised over&nbsp;260,000 SOHO routers, IP cameras with malware. This botnet was used by the "Flax Typhoon" threat actors for DDoS attacks and as a proxy to launch stealthy&nbsp;attacks on other organizations.</p>
<p>While these attacks have been attributed to different Chinese hacking groups, they are believed to operate under the same umbrella, commonly sharing infrastructure and tools.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2024/10/07/whats-new-in-ruby-on-rails-8.html">https://blog.appsignal.com/2024/10/07/whats-new-in-ruby-on-rails-8.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41766515">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2024/9/27/rails-8-beta1-no-paas-required">Rails 8 beta</a> has officially been released, bringing an exciting set
of features, bug fixes, and improvements. This version builds on the foundation
of
Rails 7.2,
while introducing new features and optimizations to make Rails development even
more productive and enjoyable.</p>
<p>Key highlights include an integration with Kamal 2 for hassle-free deployments, the
introduction of Propshaft as the new default asset pipeline, and extensive
ActiveRecord enhancements. Rails 8 also brings several SQLite integration upgrades
that make it a viable option for production use.</p>
<p>Let's dive in and explore everything that Rails 8 has to offer!</p>
<h2 id="effortless-deployments-with-kamal-2-and-thruster">Effortless Deployments with Kamal 2 and Thruster</h2>
<p>Rails 8 makes deploying your applications simple with
Kamal 2 and Thruster.</p>
<p><a href="https://kamal-deploy.org/">Kamal 2</a> reduces the need for reliance on managed cloud services and Platform as a Service (PaaS) platforms by
enabling quick and easy deployment to cloud VMs, bare metal servers, or VPS
environments in just minutes.</p>
<p>With a single command (<code>kamal setup</code>), you can set up a production-ready Rails
environment on a standard Linux box, making deployment both easy and
cost-effective.</p>
<p>Kamal 2 also integrates with <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/thruster">Thruster</a>, a custom proxy built specifically for
Rails that enables zero-downtime deployments, HTTP/2 support, automated SSL with
Let's Encrypt, Gzip compression, and easy hosting of multiple apps on a single
server — all without complex setup.</p>
<p>With Kamal 2 and Thruster, Rails 8 makes deploying apps easier than ever. And if
you prefer a different deployment setup, you can opt out using the
<code>--skip-kamal</code> flag to maintain your existing workflows.</p>
<h2 id="leaner-rails-deployments-with-solid-adapters">Leaner Rails Deployments with Solid Adapters</h2>
<p>One of the big improvements in Rails 8 is simpler deployments by reducing
the number of additional services needed to implement common web application
requirements.</p>
<p>Traditionally, if you required features like job queues, caching, and pub/sub
messaging, you'd use a combination of a database like PostgreSQL with Redis for
auxiliary functions.</p>
<p>With Rails 8, you can handle all these with just SQLite, thanks to three new
database-backed adapters: <a href="https://github.com/rails/solid_cable">Solid Cable</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rails/solid_cache">Solid Cache</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/rails/solid_queue">Solid Queue</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Solid Cable</strong> is Rails' new default Action Cable adapter in production and
means you can drop the common dependency on Redis. It acts as the
pub/sub server, relaying messages between the app and connected clients using
fast polling through SQLite. Despite polling, Solid Cable's performance
is comparable to Redis in most situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solid Cache</strong> replaces the need for Redis by using disk storage instead of
RAM for caching. This approach allows for much larger, more cost-effective
caches that persist longer and handle more requests without sacrificing
performance. It also supports encrypted storage and retention policies to
meet privacy requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solid Queue</strong> replaces Redis for
<a href="https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html">Active Job</a>
background processing, using the <code>FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code> mechanism for
efficient job handling (compatible with PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite). It
includes essential features like concurrency control, retries, and recurring
jobs, and has proven itself at <a href="https://www.hey.com/">HEY</a>, where it now
manages 20 million jobs per day.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These three adapters are designed around a simple idea: modern SSDs and NVMe
drives are fast enough to handle many tasks that previously required in-memory
solutions. By tapping into these speedy drives, Rails cuts out the need for
separate RAM-based tools like Redis.</p>

<h2 id="sqlite-is-ready-for-production">SQLite is Ready for Production</h2>
<p>Rails 8 takes SQLite from a lightweight development tool to a reliable choice
for production use, thanks to extensive work on the SQLite adapter and Ruby
driver.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the solid adapters discussed above, SQLite now has the
capability to power Action Cable, Rails.cache, and Active Job effectively,
expanding its role beyond just prototyping or testing environments.</p>
<p>Here are some key improvements to the SQLite integration in Rails 8:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-text search and virtual tables are now supported using
<code>create_virtual_table</code>.</li>
<li>The adapter now allows bulk insert fixtures for enhanced data seeding
performance.</li>
<li>Transactions default to <code>IMMEDIATE</code> mode to improve concurrency.</li>
<li>Enhanced error handling by translating <code>SQLite3::BusyException</code> into
<code>ActiveRecord::StatementTimeout</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-new-era-for-the-asset-pipeline-with-propshaft">A New Era for the Asset Pipeline with Propshaft</h2>
<p>Rails 8 also introduces <a href="https://github.com/rails/propshaft">Propshaft</a> as the
new asset pipeline default, replacing the long-standing
<a href="https://github.com/rails/sprockets">Sprockets</a> system. Sprockets served Rails
developers well for over a decade, but it was designed in a different era — before
the explosion of JavaScript build tools and modern browser improvements.</p>
<p>Propshaft reflects a simpler, modern approach to managing assets, built around
the core needs of today's developers. Its purpose is straightforward: to provide a
clear path for assets and apply digest stamps for caching.</p>
<p>Unlike Sprockets, which took on numerous additional tasks, Propshaft focuses
only on what's essential, fitting naturally with the new Rails philosophy of
keeping asset pipelines lean (while complex JavaScript handling is left to
specialized tools like Esbuild or Vite).</p>
<h2 id="built-in-authentication-made-simple">Built-In Authentication Made Simple</h2>
<p>Rails has been building the key components of authentication over the years,
from <code>has_secure_password</code> in Rails 5 to <code>normalizes</code>, <code>generates_token_for</code> and
<code>authenticate_by</code> in
<a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2023/02/15/whats-new-in-rails-7-1.html">Rails 7.1</a>.</p>
<p>With Rails 8, all these components come together to give you a straightforward
starting point for building a secure, session-based authentication system.</p>
<p>By running a single command, you can set up all the essentials for an
authentication system with database-backed sessions and password reset
functionality:</p>

<p>This command generates key files, including models, controllers, mailers, and
views:</p>

<p>This effectively puts you on the fast track to secure, production-ready
authentication. All that's left is to integrate a user sign-up flow
customized to your application's needs.</p>
<h2 id="new-script-folder-and-generator">New Script Folder and Generator</h2>
<p>Rails 8 introduces a new <code>script</code> folder dedicated to holding one-off or
general-purpose scripts, such as data migrations, cleanup tasks, or other
utility operations. This addition helps organize these scripts neatly, keeping
them separate from your main application logic.</p>
<p>To make script creation easier, a new script generator is available. You can
generate scripts with a simple command:</p>

<p>These commands create the corresponding script files, which you can then execute
with:</p>

<p>This streamlined approach keeps your application organized and makes handling
custom scripts more convenient and maintainable.</p>
<h2 id="a-slew-of-active-record-improvements">A Slew of Active Record Improvements</h2>
<p>Active Record has also seen major enhancements in Rails 8 to improve
performance, simplify migrations, improve troubleshooting, and provide better
support for complex database use cases.</p>
<p>Below are some of the key changes introduced in this latest version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rails 8 now distinguishes between <code>float4</code> and <code>float8</code> in PostgreSQL.</li>
<li><code>drop_table</code> now supports dropping multiple tables at once.</li>
<li>Support for PostgreSQL table inheritance and native partitioning has been
added.</li>
<li>Bulk inserts of fixtures are now supported to improve data seeding performance.</li>
<li>Migrating a fresh database now starts by loading the database schema before
running the migrations.</li>
<li><code>create_schema</code> and <code>drop_schema</code> operations are now reversible.</li>
<li>Rails 8 now requires MySQL 5.6.4 or later due to advancements like datetime
with precision.</li>
<li>Query log tags are enabled by default in development environments to trace SQL
statements back to the application code and identify which database is in use.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>Rails 8 introduces a range of impactful updates, from easier deployments with
Kamal and a modern asset pipeline to significant ActiveRecord enhancements and
improved production capabilities for SQLite.</p>
<p>These advancements not only boost developer productivity but also align with
modern best practices, allowing you to focus on building your application
instead of dealing with infrastructure complexities.</p>
