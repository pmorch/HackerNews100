<h3>How much do publishers earn from ad impressions?</h3>
<p>The amount of money an ad impression generates varies significantly across display mediums and content categories.</p>
<p>But we can get a good heuristic from <a href="https://adsense.google.com/start/#calculator">Google's AdSense estimated revenue calculator</a>.</p>
<p>The calculator gives you an estimate for your annual ad revenue potential based upon your content category (Finance, Games, Health, etc...) and your monthly page views.</p>
<p>For example, putting in 50k page views a month, with a Finance category, gives a potential yearly earnings of $2,000.</p>
<p>I'm going to take the <strong>median</strong> across all categories, which is an estimated annual revenue of $1,550 for 50,000 monthly page views.</p>
<p>This is approximately <strong>~$0.00022 earned per page view</strong>.</p>
<h3>How much does it cost to generate AI content?</h3>
<p>Let's invent a blog that generates content in response to whatever the user types in the search bar.</p>
<p>We'll generate the article the user is looking for, on the fly. Will it be mostly nonsense? Probably. But let's go for it anyway, just to illustrate a point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>user: "how to have my macbook audibly greet me whenever I flip it open"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to facilitate this, we'll wrap the user's query around a prompt.</p>
<p>Below is the prompt we'll use.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>You are an excellent blog writer. You write blogs that rank well in search engines because you know about SEO and how to use highly relevant and popular keywords. Your blog posts are informative, and help users achieve what they are looking for.

You will receive queries from users searching for blog posts. You will create blog posts that matches their query, that are helpful, and that answer or are relevant to whatever they are searching for.

Respond with only the blog post.</code></pre></div>
<p>With this prompt, and the user query, we have <strong>119 input tokens</strong> according to <a href="https://platform.openai.com/playground/chat?models=gpt-4o-mini">OpenAI's Playground</a>.</p>
<p>The response generated by gpt4o-mini, is only <strong>829 output tokens</strong>.</p>

If you want your MacBook to greet you with a chime or a specific sound every time you flip it open, it’s a fun way to personalize your device and make your daily interactions a bit more exciting. While macOS doesn’t come with a built-in feature to audibly greet you immediately upon opening the lid, there are a few creative workarounds to achieve a similar effect. In this blog post, we will discuss a couple of methods you can set up for your MacBook to greet you audibly.

## Method 1: Setting Up a Startup Sound

1. **System Preferences:**
   - Go to the Apple menu in the upper-left corner of your screen.
   - Select **System Preferences**.
   - Click on **Sound** and then navigate to the **Sound Effects** tab.
   
2. **Enable Startup Sound:**
   - Make sure the option “Play sound on startup” is checked. This way, your MacBook will play the selected sound every time you start it up.
   - Note: This method will only play sound when the MacBook is fully powered down and then opened again.

While this method does not greet you specifically upon opening the lid from sleep mode, it’s effective for a full startup.

## Method 2: Create an Automator App for a Custom Greeting

For more customization, you can use the Automator app to create your own greeting sound that plays when the MacBook wakes from sleep.

### Steps to Create Your Greeting:

1. **Open Automator:**
   - Search for **Automator** in Spotlight Search or find it in the Applications folder.

2. **Create New Document:**
   - Choose **New Document** and select **Application**.

3. **Use the Run Shell Script Action:**
   - In the sidebar, find **Utilities** and drag the **Run Shell Script** action to the main area.

4. **Enter the AppleScript Command:**
   - Replace the default script with the following:
     ```bash
     osascript -e 'tell app "System Events" to say "Welcome back!"'
     ```

5. **Choose Your Sound:**
   - If you want a specific sound file instead of a spoken greeting, use the following command instead:
     ```bash
     afplay /path/to/your/soundfile.mp3
     ```
   - Make sure you replace `/path/to/your/soundfile.mp3` with the actual file path of your chosen audio file.

6. **Save Your Application:**
   - Go to **File &gt; Save**, and name it something like “Greeting Sound.” Ensure it is saved in the Applications folder.

### Automating the Greeting Sound:

1. **Open System Preferences:**
   - Go to **System Preferences** and select **Users &amp; Groups**.

2. **Select Your User Account:**
   - Click on your username and select the **Login Items** tab.

3. **Add Your Automator App:**
   - Click the **“+”** button and navigate to the Greeting Sound app you created. Add it to the list.

Now, whenever your MacBook wakes from sleep, your personalized greeting sound will play.

## More Personalization Options

- **Use a Different Voice:** If you used the text-to-speech option, you can change the voice in **System Preferences** &gt; **Accessibility** &gt; **Spoken Content**.
- **Add More Sounds:** You can repeat the process for multiple sounds or greetings by creating separate Automator apps.

## Conclusion

By using the methods outlined above, you can add a personal touch to your MacBook experience. Whether you choose the simple startup sound or get creative with an Automator app, these options allow you to greet your MacBook (and yourself) every time you open it. So, go ahead and set it up, and enjoy your daily welcome back! 

Feel free to share your own unique greeting sounds or any additional tips in the comments below!</code></pre></div>

<p>The cost to generate the article was <strong>$0.00051525</strong>. And it wasn't half-bad.</p>
<h3>Ad impression vs AI cost.</h3>
<p>You can probably see where I'm going with this now.</p>
<p>For that blog post, we might earn <strong>~$0.00022</strong> for the single page impression from the user that requested it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the blog post itself, had a cost of <strong>$0.00051525</strong> to generate.</p>
<p>We made a net profit of $0.00022 - $0.00051525 = <strong>$-0.00029525</strong>!</p>
<p>Woohoo, we lost money! We're going to be rich!</p>
<p>Joking aside, let's imagine that blog post receives <strong>only 5 page views</strong> throughout its entire lifetime, which is a pretty conservative estimate to make.</p>
<p>Now, we'll earn $0.00022 * 5 = <strong>$0.0011</strong>.</p>
<p>Subtracting our cost, $0.0011 - $0.00051525 = <strong>$0.00058475</strong>.</p>
<p>That's <strong>5.8 hundreths of a penny</strong>. Don't go spending it all in one place.</p>
<h2>Is this going to actually happen?</h2>
<p>Will the future of the internet be entirely dynamically generated AI blogs in response to user queries?</p>
<p>I don't know. I hope not. But the internet has been on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">downward trend for a while now</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the internet is probably already SEO content blogspam generated by cheap copywriters.</p>
<h2>Is anyone doing this now?</h2>
<p>In a fun way, yes, check out <a href="https://websim.ai/">Websim</a> which uses LLMs to dynamically generate an alternative internet. It's a "web simulator" brought to you by AI.</p>
<p>They're not making money though. There aren't any ads (yet).</p></section><hr></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Thesis</strong>: Crowdstrike is not worth 93 billion dollars (at time of writing).</p>

<p><strong>Fear</strong>: CrowdStrike is an enterprise-grade employee spying app masquerading as a cloud application observability dashboard.</p>

<p><strong>OBSERVATIONS</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The 75th percentile retail investor has a tenuous grasp on “Cloud”, “Software Engineering”, and “Cyber Security”.</li>
<li>The median “Cyber Security Analyst” has a tenuous grasp on “Cyber Security”</li>
<li>The median “Software Engineer” has a tenuous grasp on “Cyber Security” and “Cloud”</li>
<li>The median retail investor has a tenuous grasp on “markets” and “liquidity pools”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>CRITIQUES</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Corporations could buy CrowdStrike to spy on their own employees.</p></li>
<li><p>CrowdStrike’s utility is limited- they simply collect all of their customer’s data and display it on a dashboard. </p></li>
<li><p>CrowdStrike is dangerous in that they have root access to every device(i.e. endpoint) across thousands of firms.</p></li>
<li><p>CrowdStrike customers sign up to get their firm’s data added to a bank which CrowdStrike then has license to use for “correlation”</p></li>
<li><p>CrowdStrike is a sitting-duck datamine for the FBI/NSA to subpoena. </p></li>
<li><p>CrowdStrike could potentially behave as a propaganda arm of the US government by creating “fake hacking stories” which are un-disprovable.They are able to do this due to information asymmetries in society.</p></li>
<li><p>Properly built “cloud applications” have security baked in by virtue of separation of concerns in the "software supply chain". (e.g. containerization engine developer is different than the OS developer is different than the Cloud Infrastructure Provider). </p></li>
<li><p>CrowdStrike’s Falcon product contradicts their own guiding principle of “Zero-Trust Security”.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>COMMENTARY</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>CrowdStrike’s product includes a “client” which runs on every "customer endpoint” (i.e. company issued laptop). Activity on the company issued laptop is reported to an internal dashboard which only an IT guy + a C-Suite admin have access to. They ALSO offer observability into each component of a business’s own “cloud application”.</li>
<li>These are 100% different lines of business which can be easily conflated.</li>
<li>CrowdStrike admits that they collect all of a business’ “endpoint data'' and they compare it to other data they have to "draw insights"; this means that every company that hires CrowdStrike is part of a DATA COMMUNE.</li>
<li>It’s prohibitively hard to hack into a “cloud system” due to few possible entry points</li>
<li>Exfiltrating data at scale is difficult; employees of the company pose a bigger threat than "threat-actors".</li>
<li><em>Containerize Everything</em> + <em>Microservices Architecture</em> hampers "lateral movement". </li>
<li>Is CrowdStrike compatible with companies that run their IT systems on premises?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The CrowdStrike Story So Far…</em></p>

<p><strong>2020</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>“Uses cloud technology to detect and thwart attempted cybersecurity breaches”</p></li>
<li><p>“Runs on your endpoint or server or workload”</p></li>
<li><p>“Signature based technologies don’t go far enough”</p></li>
<li><p>“We collect trillions of events” </p></li>
<li><p>“There hasn’t been a salesforce of security” </p></li>
</ul>

<p>—  FAST FORWARD — </p>

<p><strong>2024</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Palo Alto Networks(100% different business line) is being pitted against CrowdStrike in the media. </li>
<li>Crowdstrike allegedly offers a poorly differentiated suite of generically titled products: <strong>(Falcon Discover, Falcon Spotlight, Falcon Prevent, Falcon Horizon, Falcon Insight(EDR), Falcon Insight(XDR), Falcon Overwatch, Falcon Complete(MDR), Falcon Cloud Security)</strong>. There is no way to confirm unless you schedule a meeting with their team though.</li>
<li>I spoke to a “Network Engineer” at CrowdStrike. He said that he “mostly tries to get bug bounties”. </li>
<li>“CrowdStrike сustomers: 44 of 100 Fortune 100 companies, 37 of 100 top global companies, 9 of 20 major banks &amp; 7 of the TOP 10 largest energy institutions.”  This makes it a threat vector.</li>
</ul>

<p>Misleading videos on their site: </p>

</ul>

<p><strong>My Position:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>CRWD $185 Put, 11/21/25 expiration date,.</li>

<p>Airlines, payment processors, 911 call centers, TV networks, and other businesses have been scrambling this morning after a buggy update to CrowdStrike's Falcon security software caused Windows-based systems to crash with a dreaded blue screen of death (BSOD) error message.</p>
<p>We're updating <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/major-outages-at-crowdstrike-microsoft-leave-the-world-with-bsods-and-confusion/">our story about the outage</a> with new details as we have them. Microsoft and CrowdStrike <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-falcon-content-update-for-windows-hosts/">both say</a> that "the affected update has been pulled," so what's most important for IT admins in the short term is getting their systems back up and running again. According to guidance from Microsoft, fixes range from annoying but easy to incredibly time-consuming and complex, depending on the number of systems you have to fix and the way your systems are configured.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Azure status page outlines several fixes. The first and easiest is simply to try to reboot affected machines over and over, which gives affected machines multiple chances to try to grab CrowdStrike's non-broken update before the bad driver can cause the BSOD. Microsoft <a href="https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status">says</a> that some of its customers have had to reboot their systems as many as 15 times to pull down the update.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-11.01.45%E2%80%AFAM.png" data-height="670" data-width="1444" alt="Early guidance for fixing the CrowdStrike bug is simply to reboot systems over and over again so that they can try to grab a non-broken update."><img alt="Early guidance for fixing the CrowdStrike bug is simply to reboot systems over and over again so that they can try to grab a non-broken update." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-11.01.45%E2%80%AFAM-980x455.png" width="980" height="455"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-11.01.45%E2%80%AFAM.png" data-height="670" data-width="1444">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Early guidance for fixing the CrowdStrike bug is simply to reboot systems over and over again so that they can try to grab a non-broken update.</p><p>Microsoft</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2>If rebooting doesn’t work</h2>
<p>If rebooting multiple times isn't fixing your problem, Microsoft recommends restoring your systems using a backup from before 4:09 UTC on July 18 (just after midnight on Friday, Eastern time), when CrowdStrike began pushing out the buggy update. Crowdstrike says a reverted version of the file was deployed at 5:27 UTC.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>If these simpler fixes don't work, you may need to boot your machines into Safe Mode so you can manually delete the file that's causing the BSOD errors. For virtual machines, Microsoft recommends <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/windows/troubleshoot-recovery-disks-portal-windows">attaching the virtual disk to a known-working repair VM</a> so the file can be deleted, then reattaching the virtual disk to its original VM.</p>
<p>The file in question is a CrowdStrike driver located at <code>Windows/System32/Drivers/CrowdStrike/C<strong>-</strong>00000291*.sys</code>. Once it's gone, the machine should boot normally and grab a non-broken version of the driver.</p>
<p>Deleting that file on each and every one of your affected systems individually is time-consuming enough, but it's even&nbsp;<em>more</em> time-consuming for customers using Microsoft's BitLocker drive encryption to protect data at rest. Before you can delete the file on those systems, you'll need the recovery key that unlocks those encrypted disks and makes them readable (normally, this process is invisible, because the system can just read the key stored in a physical or virtual TPM module).</p>
<p>This can cause problems for admins who aren't using key management to store their recovery keys, since (by design!) you can't access a drive without its recovery key. If you don't have that key, Cryptography and infrastructure engineer Tony Arcieri on Mastodon <a href="https://mas.to/@bascule/112813348028513131">compared this</a> to a "self-inflicted ransomware attack," where an attacker encrypts the disks on your systems and withholds the key until they get paid.</p>
<p>And even if you do have a recovery key, your key management server <a href="https://mas.to/@pinkforest@hachyderm.io/112813354182343410">might also be affected by the CrowdStrike bug</a>.</p>
<p>We'll continue to track recommendations from <a href="https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-falcon-content-update-for-windows-hosts/">CrowdStrike</a> about fixes as each company's respective status pages are updated.</p>
<p>"We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption," <a href="https://x.com/George_Kurtz/status/1814316045185822981">wrote</a> CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz on X, formerly Twitter. "We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-block-key="zt1vd">Scientists were stunned on May 30 when a rock that NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover drove over cracked open to reveal something never seen before on the Red Planet: yellow sulfur crystals.</p><p data-block-key="cj811">Since October 2023, the rover has been exploring a region of Mars <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-curiosity-mars-rover-reaches-long-awaited-salty-region">rich with sulfates</a>, a kind of salt that contains sulfur and forms as water evaporates. But where past detections have been of sulfur-based minerals — in other words, a mix of sulfur and other materials — the rock Curiosity recently cracked open is made of elemental, or pure, sulfur. It isn’t clear what relationship, if any, the elemental sulfur has to other sulfur-based minerals in the area.</p><p data-block-key="mh48">While people associate sulfur with the odor from rotten eggs (the result of hydrogen sulfide gas), elemental sulfur is odorless. It forms in only a narrow range of conditions that scientists haven’t associated with the history of this location. And Curiosity found a lot of it — an entire field of bright rocks that look similar to the one the rover crushed.</p></div><div><p data-block-key="833vq">“This was not a quiet period on Mars,” said Becky Williams, a scientist with the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, and the deputy principal investigator of Curiosity’s Mast Camera, or <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/msl-curiosity/science-instruments/#h-mastcam">Mastcam</a>. “There was an exciting amount of activity here. We’re looking at multiple flows down the channel, including energetic floods and boulder-rich flows.”</p><h3 data-block-key="b1o8c"><b>A Hole in 41</b></h3><p data-block-key="1fo2c">All this evidence of water continues to tell a more complex story than the team’s early expectations, and they’ve been eager to take a rock sample from the channel in order to learn more. On June 18, they got their chance.</p><p data-block-key="4nqk2">While the sulfur rocks were too small and brittle to be sampled with the drill, a large rock nicknamed “Mammoth Lakes” was spotted nearby. Rover engineers had to search for a part of the rock that would allow safe drilling and find a parking spot on the loose, sloping surface.</p><p data-block-key="69md5">After Curiosity bored its 41st hole using the powerful drill at the end of the rover’s 7-foot (2-meter) robotic arm, the six-wheeled scientist trickled the powderized rock into instruments inside its belly for further analysis so that scientists can determine what materials the rock is made of.</p><p data-block-key="28kmt">Curiosity has since <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/blogs/sols-4236-4238-one-more-time-for-contact-science-at-mammoth-lakes/">driven away from Mammoth Lakes</a> and is now off to see what other surprises are waiting to be discovered within the channel.</p><h3 data-block-key="1ntcr"><b>More About the Mission</b></h3><p data-block-key="a89km">Curiosity was built by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managed by Caltech in Pasadena, California. JPL leads the mission on behalf of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington.</p><p data-block-key="23pss">For more about Curiosity, visit:</p><p data-block-key="fo00b"><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/msl-curiosity">science.nasa.gov/mission/msl-curiosity</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The new rules&nbsp;will impact the prison telecom industry deeply. Loss of revenue is expected to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars (though not equal to the savings to incarcerated people and their families as the industry's business model shifts and correctional agencies purchase security and surveillance services directly). This&nbsp;comes as the two largest market players, Aventiv and ViaPath, each navigate financial crises. Aventiv recently<a href="https://worthrises.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d5deffca38b8d1f6cd5d6dfc9&amp;id=79823f19b8&amp;e=6c5990aeb2" target="_blank"> </a>effectively <a href="https://worthrises.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d5deffca38b8d1f6cd5d6dfc9&amp;id=2bef16be55&amp;e=6c5990aeb2" target="_blank">defaulted on its $1.3 billion debt</a> after a year of failed refinancing efforts. ViaPath was reportedly closing in on a $1.5 billion refinancing deal until news of the <a href="https://worthrises.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d5deffca38b8d1f6cd5d6dfc9&amp;id=2e6d95e517&amp;e=6c5990aeb2" target="_blank">regulations killed the deal</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The FCC’s new rules also come as an increasing number of states move to make prison and jail communication free. In 2023, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Colorado each passed legislation to make prison calls free. California made prison calls free in 2022 and Connecticut in 2021. Campaigns are currently underway in more than a dozen other states.</p><p><strong>Former FCC Acting Chairwoman of the FCC and member of the Board of Directors of the Benton Institute for Broadband &amp; Society Mignon Clyburn </strong>said,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>“Today marks a major milestone on the long road to right a market dysfunction that has wronged incarcerated persons and their loved ones for decades. &nbsp;I have nothing but praise for Chairwoman Rosenworcel and her fellow Commissioners who moved this item forward, and the hard-working FCC staff for crafting forceful rules that are faithful to the goals of the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act.”</p><p>“Today, we cross a major milestone in the decades-long quest to prevent gauging of families when they pay to communicate with their incarcerated loved ones. With the Federal Communications Commission vote today, prices are dropping between 8 and 14 cents per minute from existing voice calling caps, and video communication will benefit from rate protections for the first time. Lower cost communication means more memories and tighter bonds, it means more opportunities to say 'I love you' and 'I miss you' at the moment they can make a huge difference in a child's life. It brings people together instead of breaking them apart under the weight of impossible financial burdens,” said <strong>Cheryl A. Leanza, policy advisor to the United Church of Christ Media Justice Ministry.</strong> “The journey to this day has been decades in the making, from Mrs. Martha Wright-Reed, who was willing to put&nbsp;her name on a lawsuit more than 20 years ago, to bi-partisan champions in Congress, hard-working agency leaders and staff, fellow advocates, and most important: the countless family members and incarcerated people who took the time to tell their stories, write postcards, contact their legislators or attend a Federal Communications Commission listening session. It all really does make a difference.”</p><p>“Today, 18 months from the passage of the Marta Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act of 2022, the Federal Communications Commission took action to end predatory prison phone rates. After a decade of advocacy, incarcerated individuals and their loved ones will be able to communicate with each other without the barrier of burdensome fees. The absence of these predatory rates is life-changing, potentially lowering rates of depression, isolation, and loneliness incarcerated individuals experience while in prison and helping them succeed when reentering their communities,” said <strong>Koustubh “K.J.” Bagchi, Vice President of the Center for Civil Rights and Technology at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.</strong></p><p>“Incarcerated people and their loved ones have paid an unconscionably high price for the greed of the companies who provide telecom services to prisons, jails and detention centers. Thankfully, that’s about to change,” said <strong>Heather Franklin, Internet Campaign Director at Free Press. </strong>“The ability for incarcerated people to maintain regular communication with loved ones, legal counsel and clergy is a human-rights issue. Incarcerated people should be able to connect and communicate without being subject to extortionate rates. We’re grateful for the work of FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, the other commissioners, agency staff, and decades of work by advocates across the country who’ve made today’s strides possible.”&nbsp;</p><p>“The FCC’s action today will help to ensure that families no longer have to pay inflated, predatory rates to speak to their incarcerated loved ones,” said <strong>Ariel Nelson, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, who leads its Criminal Justice Debt &amp; Reintegration Project.</strong> “We are grateful the Commission has also put a stop to two enduring areas of consumer abuse–outrageous fees and site commissions–bringing meaningful financial relief and connection to families across the country.”</p><p>"With today’s order, the FCC affirmed what our movement has been saying for decades: The families of incarcerated people should not be shouldering the costs of their loved ones’ incarceration," said <strong>Peter Wagner, Executive Director of the Prison Policy Initiative. </strong>"Capping the costs of all phone and video calls, as the FCC has done, will bring relief to millions of families, and other provisions in its order will prevent the exploitation of consumers through fees and deceptive pricing. We are glad to see the FCC take these steps toward true consumer protection for incarcerated people."</p><p>“For years, incarcerated people unable to afford exorbitant call rates have been denied the ability to easily communicate with their loved ones, their communities, and even their attorneys. These excessive communications costs hurt incarcerated people as well as their families and communities. By requiring just and reasonable rates, the FCC is working to keep families together and to ease the return to society of incarcerated people. We commend Chairwoman Rosenworcel for her leadership in keeping incarcerated people connected and applaud the FCC for requiring reasonable rates for these vital communications,”<strong> </strong>said <strong>Al Kramer, senior fellow at Public Knowledge.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“We applaud the leadership of Chairwoman Rosenworcel and the Federal Communications Commission for taking this important and monumental action. The FCC’s order serves as a transformative win for incarcerated peoples and their loved ones who for far too long have had to grapple with outrageous rates,” said <strong>Rebekah P. Goodheart, Jenner &amp; Block LLP, pro bono counsel to the Wright Petitioners. </strong>“Thanks to the tireless advocacy of various groups and civil rights organizations, much-needed relief will be provided.”</p><p>"It’s exciting to see that the Federal Communications Commission is taking steps to enact the Martha Wright-Reed legislation to lower the cost of prison phone calls," said&nbsp;<strong>Brandon Tucker, Senior Policy Director at Color Of Change.</strong> "This is a major step in prison justice. Phone call costs have been predatory and it has never made sense for families of incarcerated people to pay high amounts of money to stay in contact with their loved ones. The system was rooted in corporate greed and not rehabilitation. It is unacceptable that families have gone into debt accepting phone calls from jails and prison. Thank you to Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel and other commissioners for rectifying this misstep in our judicial system."</p></div><p><a href="https://worthrises.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d5deffca38b8d1f6cd5d6dfc9&amp;id=132d7170b3&amp;e=6c5990aeb2" target="_blank">Worth Rises</a> is a non-profit advocacy organization dedicated to dismantling the prison industry and ending the exploitation of those it targets.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">“All in.” Your opponent slides a stack of chips across the high-stakes poker table. You glance back at your cards, a pair of sixes. The game is <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/game-theorists-crack-poker/">Texas Hold’em</a>. Only two of you remain, and no community (face-up) cards have been dealt yet. Things rarely get simpler than this in poker, and you have a binary decision to make: call (match your opponent’s bet) or fold (give up). To a professional player, though, every detail demands consideration. What was the betting pattern before the all-in push? Who acted first? How many chips does each player have, and how many are in the pot? When will the blinds, or forced bets, increase? And of course, how likely are sixes to win the hand? You’ve studied poker strategy, memorized <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-gambling-strategy-thats-guaranteed-to-make-money-and-why-you-should-never-use-it/">probability</a> tables and run the numbers in your head. It all points to folding as the objectively best decision. But you’ve noticed over a prolonged tournament that your opponent has a tendency to overbet with mediocre hands. Do you stick with your training and fold or adjust your strategy on the fly to exploit the weakness you’ve observed?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">This question of whether to use what’s known as “game theory optimal versus exploitative play” captures a central conversation in <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-conquers-six-player-poker/">high-level poker</a>. Its mathematical underpinnings trace back 80 years, but rapid advances in AI have brought mid-20th-century math to the forefront of modern gaming. New tools teach poker players <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/physics-of-texas-hold-em-poker/">optimal strategy</a> for the game, so why would they ever decline to use it?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">[<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/games/"><i>Play science-inspired games, puzzles and quizzes in our new Games section</i></a>]</p><hr><h2>On supporting science journalism</h2><p>If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by<!-- --> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/getsciam/">subscribing</a>. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.</p><hr><h2 data-block="sciam/heading">Optimal Play?</h2><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Objectively optimal play might seem counterintuitive in a game based on randomly dealt cards and messy human psychology. Take bluffing—when a player pretends they hold an unbeatable hand to scare an opponent into folding. Lying about one’s cards feels inherently psychological and resists a rigorous mold of objectivity. But we should never underestimate mathematicians’ knack for turning human behavior into tidy equations.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In fact, the foundational 1944 book on mathematical game theory by mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1r2gkx"><i>Theory of Games and Economic Behavior</i></a>, highlighted poker as a central example. The authors analyzed a simplified variant that distilled the game down to its most fundamental dynamics: two players would each receive a number between 0 and 1, with higher numbers representing stronger hands, and then engage in a single round of betting. Von Neumann and Morgenstern proved not only that an optimal strategy exists but also that bluffing is an essential part of that strategy.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Of course, Texas Hold’em packs a great deal more complexity than this toy example. Who’s to say that an optimal strategy even exists in full-fledged multiplayer poker? The late mathematician John Nash, that’s who. In the 1950s Nash, who went on to win a Nobel prize in economics in 1994 and was later depicted in the 2001 biopic <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/beautiful-mind-john-nash-s-schizophrenia-disappeared-as-he-aged/"><i>A Beautiful Mind</i></a><i>,</i> propelled the then nascent field of game theory. His most famous discovery, now called a Nash equilibrium, occurs when no player of a game would benefit by deviating from their chosen strategy (assuming others don’t deviate from theirs).</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-game-theory-and-w/">Game theorists</a> consider this condition optimal because if you and I play a game where we each begin with any old strategy, and then I adapt mine to take advantage of what I see you doing, and then you counter-adapt to my change, and so on, we will eventually reach a steady state in which neither of us can keep improving. With a Nash equilibrium, players can even announce their strategies in advance, and still everybody’s best course will be to stick with the equilibrium. In a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.36.1.48">one-page paper</a> in 1950, John Nash proved that <i>every</i> finite competitive game—from mahjong to Magic: The Gathering—has at least one Nash equilibrium.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Despite its name, game theory applies to a broad spectrum of topics beyond traditional games, including economic systems, nuclear deterrence and evolutionary biology. To researchers in this field, games refer to any interactions among rational decision-makers whose actions and payoffs can be rigorously defined and analyzed. So Nash’s theorem has wide-reaching implications. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/cocktail-party-physics/knowing-when-to-fold-em-the-science-of-poker/">In poker</a>, it justifies the search for optimal strategies in a game once thought to rely on gut instinct and reading tells.</p><h2 data-block="sciam/heading">An AI Poker Revolution</h2><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Just because we know that Texas Hold’em has a Nash equilibrium, that doesn’t mean we know what it looks like. As games ratchet up in complexity, their optimal strategies tend to become harder to figure out. Anyone could learn how to play perfect tic-tac-toe in one sitting by memorizing a few move sequences. For a more elaborate game such as checkers, which always ends in a draw with perfect play, humans could never memorize enough variations to implement the optimal strategy. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1144079">Scientists have created unbeatable algorithms</a> that play optimally, however, because computers can store massive databases of positions and extensively search the game tree in a way that humans cannot. Meanwhile chess computers have dominated the best human players since around 1997 (when world champion Garry Kasparov lost a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/history/deep-blue">historic match</a> to IBM’s Deep Blue), yet chess computers still don’t exhibit optimal play—the next generation of chess engines will crush today’s.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Unlike chess, poker involves <i>imperfect information</i>. Players know their own cards but not their competitors’, which makes the game more daunting to model computationally. This explains why the algorithmic revolution in poker didn’t come until the recent AI boom. In 2015 computer scientists <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1259433">announced an algorithm</a> that displayed essentially perfect play for a restricted version of the game with only two players and constrained bet sizes. Only four years later, we got <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay2400">the first superhuman AI for multiplayer Texas Hold’em</a>. A flurry of commercially available software tools called “solvers” followed, and in the span of a few years every rounder (person who plays poker for a living) with a few hundred dollars to spare had a card shark at their fingertips who could tell them how to play in almost every situation.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">“The game went from being this fuzzy art to a hard science,” says Liv Boeree, a former professional poker player. To stay ahead in today’s environment, advanced players study the game by using computer programs such as <a href="https://piosolver.com/">PioSOLVER</a>, which approximates optimal strategies. For simple and common situations, pros will memorize the machine’s recommendations, whereas they glean more high-level lessons from its behavior in rare and more complicated situations. For any elite poker player, studying with these solvers is essential. “If you want to play high stakes against the best, absolutely ... you’d get eaten alive [if you didn’t use solvers],” says Boeree, a World Series of Poker champion. “There were some players who just rejected the entire notion, and they didn’t work with solvers..., and for the most part, they got left behind.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">AI has both confirmed some common wisdom about Texas Hold’em strategy and overturned some maxims that players had gotten wrong. For example, computers find success in “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aay2400">donk betting</a>”—initiating the first bet on a round of betting after merely calling another player’s bet on the previous round—despite the folk belief that donk betting is an <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay2400">amateur move</a>. AIs also play a wider variety of hands in situations where expert humans tend to fold. Like chess engines, multiplayer poker solvers don’t literally play optimally, but they dominate humans thoroughly enough that we have a lot to learn from them.</p><h2 data-block="sciam/heading">How to Win</h2><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In defining the Nash equilibrium, I smuggled in a critical detail: equilibrium occurs when no player would benefit by deviating from their chosen strategy (assuming others don’t deviate from theirs). When other players <i>do </i>deviate despite this, however, it’s often wise to deviate in response.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Take rock-paper-scissors as an illustrative example. What is its Nash equilibrium? Think for a moment: What strategy from both players would leave no incentive to deviate? Answer: players should toss rock, paper and scissors perfectly at random; each has a one third chance of appearing, regardless of all previous rounds. You can announce this strategy to your opponent in advance, and they will be helpless to take advantage of your candor.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">If you and your opponent both play this equilibrium strategy, you can expect to win half of the decisive rounds (ignoring ties). Now suppose your opponent deviates. In the extreme case, imagine they always play paper. If you stick with the equilibrium strategy, then still you’ll win half of the decisive rounds because you play the winning scissors and the losing rock with equal frequency. But you can instead exploit your opponent’s deviation by always playing scissors and cutting their paper on every round. Less dramatic deviations still give you opportunities to exploit. For example, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep05830">empirical research on rock-paper-scissors</a> shows that when people win one round, they are slightly more likely to repeat the throw that they just won with. Knowing this can give you an edge. If you just lost to rock, for example, then play paper next because your opponent is likely to throw rock again. The Nash equilibrium is the only strategy that is not susceptible to exploitation.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The same dynamics play out in poker at a much more complicated scale. As players learn more optimal techniques from their AI collaborators, they also learn how to sniff out when their opponents fall short of optimal play and how best to punish them.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">You might think there’s a catch here. If your opponent deviates, isn’t the optimal decision to exploit them ruthlessly rather than to blindly stick to the Nash equilibrium and leave potential money on the table? If you discover that an opponent deviates from the Nash equilibrium in predictable ways, then deviating yourself to exploit their weakness may net you more money. As soon as you exploit them, however, <i>you’re</i> now veering from the equilibrium and opening <i>yourself</i> up to exploitation. If your opponent always throws paper and you start only throwing scissors, eventually they’ll catch on and start rocking your scissors.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">As former poker pro Igor Kurganov puts it, “any time you pick up on a mistake by your opponent, you improve your model of how they think about the game, adjust how you play against them to account for that mistake and, by that, become exploitable yourself.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Most players agree that to stay competitive at the top levels of poker they must use a blend of game theory’s optimal and exploitative play. Optimal is more defensive, whereas exploitative is more offensive. Some teachers recommend that you should begin a tournament by emulating optimal play—and only after you’ve had time to observe your opponent’s weaknesses should you sprinkle in your exploits. The flexibility to switch between strategies separates the fish from the sharks. “This whole process works better the more certain you are that you’re smarter than [your opponent] about the game,” Kurganov says, adding that “you do less exploitative adjustments when you feel like they’re as good or better than you.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">For some, the emergence of superhuman poker engines has sapped the game of its intrigue, while others contend that computers have added a new layer to the game. Boeree, who retired from pro poker in 2019 and now works as a science communicator, philanthropist and podcast host, falls more into the former camp. “It felt like it took a little bit of the magic out of the game, like, ‘Oh, okay, the mystery has been solved,’” she says. But Boeree acknowledges that the new age of poker has no shortage of enthusiasts. “Since COVID it’s been booming,” she adds. “The World Series of Poker got more players than ever before last year. Records are getting smashed. So clearly it has not killed the game.” Instead we might say that the changing landscape of poker is still finding its equilibrium.</p></div></div>]]></description>
