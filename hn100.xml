      <p><em>Radicle is a peer-to-peer, local-first code
        collaboration stack built on Git.</em></p>
      <br>
      <header>
        <h2>Radicle 1.0</h2>
        <span>10.09.2024</span>
      </header>
      <p>On March 26th, we <a href="https://x.com/radicle/status/1772659708978991605?s=20">announced</a> the first release candidate for Radicle 1.0.
Today, after five months of feedback and 17 release candidates, we are ready to
launch Radicle <code>1.0</code>.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôve been waiting for the right moment to try Radicle or to reintroduce
yourself to the stack, now is a great time to dive in: our <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">website</a>
and <a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides">guides</a> should have all the information you need to get started.
You can also browse the latest <a href="https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/seed.radicle.xyz/rad:z3gqcJUoA1n9HaHKufZs5FCSGazv5">code</a>, hosted on Radicle.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôve been tagging along, thank you, it‚Äôs been a bumpy ride and we couldn‚Äôt
have done it without you!</p>

<h2 id="try-it-out">Try it out!</h2>

<p>You can grab the latest release with the following command:</p>

<div><pre><code>curl -sSf https://radicle.xyz/install | sh
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or head over to the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/download">download</a> section to download and verify the
binaries yourself.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-the-box-">What‚Äôs in the box üì¶</h2>

<p>Radicle 1.0 represents the culmination of <a href="https://radicle.xyz/history">years</a> of experimentation
and hard work from our team and community, where we set out to ensure that free
and open source software ecosystems can flourish without having to rely on the
whims of Big Tech. We designed Radicle with a first-principles approach, as a
natural extension to Git, expanding it to work in a collaborative, local-first,
peer-to-peer setting.</p>

<p>This milestone includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An extensible, homegrown, peer-to-peer gossip and sync <a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/protocol">protocol</a>
built on the Git protocol.</li>
  <li>Social interactions such as issues, patches and code review, using our
extensible <a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/protocol#collaborative-objects">Collaborative Objects</a> system which keeps all artifacts
in the repository.</li>
  <li>A secure authentication and authorization protocol using public key
cryptography, which allows all published content to be verified locally,
without centralized authority.</li>
  <li>An intuitive CLI that should be familiar to users of Git, as well as a web
frontend for browsing Radicle repositories and seed nodes.</li>
  <li>Privacy at the protocol level, with truly private repositories and built-in
<a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/user/#4-embracing-the-onion">Tor support</a>.</li>
  <li>Reproducible and signed <a href="https://radicle.xyz/download">builds</a> for all Radicle binaries.</li>
</ul>

<p>To us, Radicle 1.0 means that Radicle is <em>ready to use</em>. It stands as a
testament that sovereign code forges are possible today, and in our opinion,
<em>necessary</em>.</p>

<p>We feel comfortable now inviting you to join us, replicate, and
<a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/user">collaborate</a> within the Radicle network or even <a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/seeder">run a seed
node</a>.</p>

<p>For an in-depth explanation of how Radicle works, check out our <a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/protocol">Protocol
Guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="stability-Ô∏è">Stability ‚õ∞Ô∏è</h2>

<p>Radicle 1.0 marks our commitment to stability: from this release onwards, all
changes to the protocol will be designed in backwards compatible way, and any
necessary change on the CLI will include a seamless upgrade path.</p>

<p>We are aware that the release candidate phase was rockier than expected for
some, but we are now in a good place to slow things down and improve stability.</p>

<p>Along with this commitment will come a more dependable and streamlined release
process which starts with this release!</p>

<h2 id="future-plans-">Future plans üîÆ</h2>

<p>There are several things in the pipeline that we intend to release when ready:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Native CI/CD capabilities</li>
  <li>The Radicle TUI (Terminal User Interface)</li>
  <li>Advanced code review functionality</li>
  <li>An inbox system for repository notifications</li>
  <li>Multi-device support and user profiles</li>
  <li>Support for other canonical references, such as tags</li>
  <li>Seed node moderation and management tools</li>
  <li>The Radicle desktop application</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="growing-ecosystem-">Growing ecosystem üå±</h2>

<p>Outside of the core stack, the ecosystem is growing nicely:  an independent
team working on integrations &amp; tooling for Radicle has developed a <a href="https://app.radicle.at/nodes/seed.radicle.gr/rad:z3Makm6fsQQXmpSFE43DZqwupaEhk">VS
Code</a> and <a href="https://app.radicle.at/nodes/seed.radicle.gr/rad:z3WHS4GSf8hChLjGYfPkJY7vCxsBK">JetBrains</a> plugin. The Radicle network now also
comprises several deployments of the Radicle <a href="https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/seed.radicle.xyz/rad:z4V1sjrXqjvFdnCUbxPFqd5p4DtH5">frontend</a>, and there are more
than 40 seed nodes operating on the network, freely replicating user content.</p>

<h2 id="invitation-to-forge-the-future-">Invitation to forge the future ü§ù</h2>

<p>Once you <a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/user#installation">install</a> Radicle and set up your identity, you‚Äôll have access
to all public repositories on any public node, making it easier to explore and
contribute to the ecosystem. Compared to traditional self-hosted forges, which
often result in fragmented collaboration environments, Radicle represents an
evolutionary step for Git-based collaboration, with a single cryptographic
identity that works across nodes.</p>

<p>Lastly, in the spirit of free and open source software, we believe that power
lies in community. As we embark on further iterating the protocol and stack, we
also invite you to shape the future of Radicle with us. Consider joining us on
our <a href="https://radicle.zulipchat.com/">Zulip</a> instance. Your ideas and insights
are invaluable to our mission of creating a sovereign forge.</p>

<p>Together, we can make significant progress towards reclaiming the internet.</p>

            <guid>41509156</guid>
            <pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 08:05:26 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://yaak.app/blog/now-open-source">https://yaak.app/blog/now-open-source</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41509156">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I hate to admit it, but <strong>the Reddit, HackerNews, and Lobsters folks were right.</strong></p>
<p>Three months ago I published <a href="https://yaak.app/blog/why-not-open-source">Why Not Open Source</a> as an
attempt to explain why Yaak <em>wouldn't</em> be open source. Having burnt out on OSS in the
past, I thought that others might find my decision-making process useful, so I shared it
to the usual places.</p>
<p>Yaak users mostly agreed, which makes sense, as they were already happy with the
close-source reality. The broader open-source community, however, strongly disagreed with
almost everything.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/qeqgiq">lobste.rs post</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1dgis44/why_yaak_is_not_open_source/">Reddit r/opensource post</a></li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41424910">HackerNews post</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few of the highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don‚Äôt conflate ‚Äúopen source‚Äù/‚Äúfree software‚Äù with github‚Äôs specific social model of
drive-by contributions, or even contributions at all...
‚Üí <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/qeqgiq/why_yaak_is_not_open_source#c_k7tr74">lobste.rs</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But all of those things are also true of closed source software.
‚Üí <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41425136">ycombinator.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The claims of this text are complete bullshit. No idea what this "app" is about,
anyways.
Dont need it. Can go to the trash can of history
‚Üí <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1dgis44/comment/l8qn0v9/">reddit.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While most of the replies weren't constructive, the quoted
<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/qeqgiq/why_yaak_is_not_open_source#c_k7tr74">500-word lobste.rs comment</a>
is absolute gold. It immediately got me thinking that <strong>maybe I was wrong.</strong> üôà</p>
<p>I wanted feedback, and that's exactly what I got.</p>
<p>The main theme was that <em><strong>open source doesn't mean open contribution.</strong></em> You can still
get most of the benefits by simply making the code public:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open to security audits</li>
<li>Transparent functionality (no shady stuff)</li>
<li>Flexibility (can still fork and modify)</li>
<li>Runnable even if the developer leaves</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted Yaak users to experience these benefits too, which is why Yaak is now open source
but closed (mostly) for contribution.</p>
<h2 id="-open-source-closedish-contribution">üôà Open source, closed(ish) contribution</h2>
<p>Many commenters pointed to projects like SQLite which are open-source but don't allow
outside contribution. For some reason, I never even considered this to be a possibility.
While Googling for more projects like this, I came
across <a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream?tab=readme-ov-file#contribution-policy">Litestream</a>,
which was initially closed to contribution and eventually opened for bug-fixes only.</p>
<p>This model made perfect sense to me, so it's exactly what I'm doing. <strong>Yaak is now open
source under the MIT license and open to contribution for bug fixes only.</strong></p>
<p><em>Now the desktop Linux users can fix their own bugs (please don't hate me)</em> üòÖ</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <h2 id="about-me">about me</h2>
<p>I am 18, born in 2006. This is generally a good thing as I am in the prime of life currently. I am not one of those people who think they were ‚Äúborn in the wrong decade‚Äù, I think I was born at the perfect time to take advantage of superlinearly growing technological advancements.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-today">the internet today</h2>
<p>I generally greatly dislike social media, although I am an avid user of it. When social media caught on, the people running these companies were tasked to make it profitable. In doing this, social media got completely ruined.</p>
<p>Our data got commodified[1], our attention got commodified, and a substantive part of who we say we are got commodified. This, in general, has led to a degradation in the quality of the internet.</p>
<p>They basically made social media like a drug, as addictive as possible. They do this by promoting FOMO and comparison in Instagram‚Äôs case. Instagram is a game, it is extremely performative. People carefully curate each part of their insta to give certain impressions.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs the ratio of followers to following you have? Are your story highlights organized and ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù? What reels are you liking?</p>
<p>There are a lot of ‚Äúrules‚Äù in this game, which are enforced by social ‚Äúins‚Äù and mutual respect.</p>
<p>When it comes to shortform content, hundreds of people compete for slivers of our attention. We are not agents in this, they are just presented to us. Completely depersonalized. They are forgotten within seconds. Ask someone watching tiktok to describe the previous tiktoks they just watched, they would be hard pressed to tell you more than a few minutes in the past. Something about tiktok is unusually addictive. all the while providing absolutely no value.</p>
<p>It has become so shallow, you can tell almost nothing about who someone actually is through Instagram or tiktok. You can only tell how they want to portray themselves to the general population and, by how they organize their profile, if they are eligible to be a part of your social circle.</p>
<h2 id="the-appeal-of-simplicity">the appeal of simplicity</h2>
<p>I wish I was around when people had blogs or even myspace. This era was deeply personal and creative. Most writing on the internet was individual, not written in search of ‚ÄúSEO‚Äù or profit but driven by the need and want of people to share knowledge‚Äìpure curiosity.</p>
<p>I want the thrill of finding new websites searching through web rings; when the web was truly the wild west and not another arm of control by mega corporations.</p>
<p>This is also reflective in the quality of content. There was little incentive to lie, to manipulate truth, and each blog entry or piece of information was tied to identity. (except in the cases of anonymity).</p>
<p>Even the content written by normal people for normal people has been commodified by sites like reddit and quora. What happened to an old fashioned forums or even usenet groups? (granted, especially for cars and hacking, there still exists plenty of forums)</p>
<p>Also, websites just simply looked cooler. Occasionally I scroll on the geocities archive and wonder, how did we get here?  What happened to the patterned backgrounds, the bright maximalist jpegs and gifs?  This is sort of contradictory to my website, as it‚Äôs almost annoyingly minimalist, but this more has to do with social norms and simplicity. Having a personal blog is already out of the ordinary, but the simple design and clear technical direction/theme gives me an excuse. I also am not that personal on here, because only a few of my friends frequent my blogs, and I want the site to be as simple and to the point as possible if a random person wants to know who I am.</p>
<h2 id="a-niche-resurgence">a niche resurgence</h2>
<p>There is <a href="https://neocities.org/">neocites</a>, and a small community of people who share this philosophy about the web (and that are relatively young), but I have not met anyone my age, in the real world, that would choose to do something like this.</p>
<p>The majority of people (my age) today would think sites like those (and, by extension, their creators) are weird.</p>
<p>[1] you can substitute ‚Äúcommodified‚Äù with ‚Äúbought and sold‚Äù</p>

The model can fold multimers more accurately (69.8%) than the MSA-based AlphaFold-Multimer model (67.7%), as measured by the DockQ acceptable prediction rate. Chai-1 is the first model that‚Äôs able to predict multimer structures using single-sequences alone (without MSA search) at AlphaFold-Multimer level quality.</p><p>For more information, and a comprehensive analysis of the model, read our <a href="https://chaiassets.com/chai-1/paper/technical_report_v1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technical report</a>.</p><h2><strong>A natively multi-modal foundation model</strong></h2><p>In addition to its frontier modeling capabilities directly from sequences, Chai-1 can be prompted with new data, e.g. restraints derived from the lab, which boost performance by double-digit percentage points.&nbsp;We explore a number of these capabilities in our technical report, such as epitope conditioning ‚Äì using even a handful of contacts or pocket residues (potentially derived from lab experiments) doubles antibody-antigen structure prediction accuracy, making antibody engineering more feasible using AI.</p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,icSSrTXU76WdTzKi30rSK70UY.png" data-framer-height="1962" data-framer-width="4716" height="981" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/icSSrTXU76WdTzKi30rSK70UY.png" width="2358"></p><h2><strong>Releasing the model for all</strong></h2><p>We are releasing Chai-1 via a web interface for free, including for commercial applications such as drug discovery.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<article>

<p>With the recent rust in Linux events in the last couple of days, It‚Äôs a good time to write up Rust in illumos. Both to spread the word a bit and also to set expectations for both sides (Rust and illumos/OpenIndiana devs) what is currently possible and what work would need to be invested to make things smooth. And also to let the rust community know about what illumos people were talking about. </p>
<p>What most of the talk currently is about, are the technical details. But we must not leave the social aspects out of it. Software distributions are not made by lone walkers but by groups of people. Bringing in a new language means facilitating change. And that means there are more topics to discuss than just API design. We are talking about impacts on the whole software lifecycle.</p>
<h2>Linux DRM API design</h2>
<p>Looking at the things people like Asahi Lina want to address inside the Linux Kernel with the Rust bindings and how she describes the issues with Locking I get the feeling something with DRM is not consistent. Looking into our code and our <a href="https://illumos.org/books/wdd/mt-17026.html#mt-17026" rel="nofollow">docs</a> for this topic I can already see that things are more complex in the whole kernel than just ‚Äúdo X‚Äù We have some general recommendations but it‚Äôs a case by case issue when looking at it over the whole kernel sources.  When looking at the illumos DRM fork I can see that a lot of X11 code seems to have wandered into the Kernel. And not many files are created by the same people. I am not surprised that this has gotten messy. The illumos kernel docs talk about multiple cases where Data can be accessed and different needs for locking with them. I assume the Linux kernel has similar cases, hence at least mentioning what locks the driver needs to do and which the DRM API does needs to be documented. </p>
<h2>Rust in the illumos Kernel</h2>
<p>The development model of illumos is different from Linux and thus there are no Rust drivers in upstream illumos yet. But that is to be expected for new things. In our model, we take the time to mature new tech in a fork, and for rust, the Oxide fork has taken that role. In there, we have several drivers for the Oxide Networking stack that are in rust. Based on that some experience could be gained. The current state is, that making things in Rust takes more time compared to C for a trained developer. There is Bindgen which has an overhead to learn and use and there is Language training that people need to become productive. It‚Äôs one thing to understand the language but becoming productive usually means quite a bit more training on top of that. So far userland tools have proven to be small enough to get to a working result within a reasonable time. OPTE and fast path Networking exist but they still need an integration into the MAC network framework. So more work needs to happen on that front. Smaller drivers are also a possibility to do I am currently unaware of somebody that had an interest though.</p>
<h2>The lack of Systems package manager support in rust</h2>
<p>Ever since npm started the packaging ecosystem has changed drastically in focus. Where package managers originally installed Software as a System they now shifted to install software on different Systems in the same way. This also changed how responsibilities are handled and how people now develop software. Distributions have become obsolete and are not of interest to people. And that leads to a couple of interesting issues. Because at the end of the day, you need a distribution to start using a Computer. And people that make distributions also need to make some income for that work. But software developers now only need to focus on their software for things to work. Compiling from source has become trivial. But only if you follow the software developer‚Äôs workflow and know the tools. For people needing to read themselves into how cargo works, some quirks make sense for software developer workflows but are a hindrance for system development workflows. Keep in mind these are different requirements than the ones the kernel needs. Systems Distributors usually do the following:</p>
<ul><li>Download the sources and make an archive with all the patches they want to bring</li>
<li>patch the sources from the patch files</li>
<li>build the binaries </li>
<li>pack them into an archive for distribution (depends on the package manager)</li></ul>
<p>Several of cargo‚Äôs features are now counterintuitive and Are the ones I find people criticising. Cargo wants to secure and check that the vendor folder has not been modified. There is no central vendor folder.  Rust software can easily have upwards of 100 dependencies and micro dependencies. So if people want audit software it becomes a lot of work. I don‚Äôt mind. I am long enough in this industry that I have lived through the Java dependency problems on Linux systems. Cargo improves upon that situation. Several other OS‚Äôs believe that there needs to be a clear differentiation between system and Third-party software. And I agree with that. The Debian approach of putting everything into one system and only having one version of each dependency is not feasible for a huge international community of people that develop together but never meet. Most of the time the devs do not talk to each other at all. I am personally of the opinion, that most of rust builds and their tier system works. And I am happy to rely on that and not just my tools. As a side note. None of this topic requires Harsh words. Systems packagers and Software developers (especially the folks in Debian and traditional Linux distros) have very different ways of thinking and cargo is not a tool for system packagers. It would be nice if it grew some support for that but that does not require harsh words. System source repos like illumos-gate can easily vendor and produce binaries with a small list of dependencies to deliver the binaries via a Package manager. The tools work.</p>
<h2>Missing support for shared libraries</h2>
<p>A feature not wanted by Software developers, developing for multiple platforms. For systems packagers, this is a required feature. Shared libraries delimit the boundary between two responsibilities. And if those people coordinate then that works well. It becomes a system. There are limits to where this can happen. So I don‚Äôt know what the perfect solution is. If shared libraries are needed at all or if that feature can fade out. But it is worth a try to build systems and to give people the possibility to do so. So I would wish Rust and Cargo gained shared library support so that we can build such componentized systems easily.</p>
<h2>An invite</h2>
<p>With all this said I would love to have some more rust folks in the illumos community. And I know this has been expressed by others as well. Userland tools are easy to make in Rust and I for one would love to have people help me with the new <a href="https://github.com/Toasterson/illumos-installer" rel="nofollow">Installer</a> and with the package <a href="https://github.com/toasterson/forge" rel="nofollow">Forge</a> We have gained rust crates for our unique API‚Äôs such as <a href="https://github.com/illumos/libcontract-sys" rel="nofollow">libcontract</a> Our new image builder for ISO‚Äôs is in rust <a href="https://github.com/illumos/image-builder" rel="nofollow">image-builder</a> and we are always looking for driver developers. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/illumos/repositories?type=all" rel="nofollow">illumos</a> for all repos Including a config manager. Want to write complete Wifi kernel parts? A small serial Adapter that you have lying around? Want to integrate with an existing Kernel without rewriting it? If anything of that makes you want to head over to <a href="https://illumos.org/books/wdd/preface.html#preface" rel="nofollow">https://illumos.org/books/wdd/preface.html#preface</a> and <a href="https://illumos.org/books/dev/" rel="nofollow">https://illumos.org/books/dev/</a> or Simply just interests you. Then we would love to have your contribution.</p>
<p>Hope to talk to some folks on Socials and email</p>

                        <h2>Logic For Programmers v0.3</h2>
<p><a href="https://leanpub.com/logic/" target="_blank">Now available</a>! It's a light release as I learn more about formatting a nice-looking book. You can see some of the differences between v2 and v3 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hillelwayne.com/post/3l3egdqnqj62o" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Why Not Comments</h2>
<p>Code is written in a structured machine language, comments are written in an expressive human language. The "human language" bit makes comments more expressive and communicative than code. Code has a limited amount of something <em>like</em> human language contained in identifiers. "Comment the why, not the what" means to push as much information as possible into identifiers. <a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/3866bd6e-22c3-4098-92ef-4d47ef287ed8" target="_blank">Not all "what" can be embedded like this</a>, but a lot can.</p>
<p>In recent years I see more people arguing that <em>whys</em> do not belong in comments either, that they can be embedded into <code>LongFunctionNames</code> or the names of test cases. Virtually all "self-documenting" codebases add documentation through the addition of identifiers.<sup id="fnref:exception"><a href="#fn:exception">1</a></sup></p>
<p>So what's something in the range of human expression that <em>cannot</em> be represented with more code?</p>
<p>Negative information, drawing attention to what's <em>not</em> there. The "why nots" of the system.</p>
<h3>A Recent Example</h3>
<p>This one comes from <em>Logic for Programmers</em>. For convoluted technical reasons the epub build wasn't translating math notation (<code>\forall</code>) into symbols (<code>‚àÄ</code>). I wrote a script to manually go through and replace tokens in math strings with unicode equivalents. The easiest way to do this is to call <code>string = string.replace(old, new)</code> for each one of the 16 math symbols I need to replace (some math strings have multiple symbols).</p>
<p>This is incredibly inefficient and I could instead do all 16 replacements in a single pass. But that would be a more complicated solution. So I did the simple way with a comment:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>Does 16 passes over each string
BUT there are only 25 math strings in the book so far and most are &lt;5 characters.
So it's still fast enough.
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can think of this as a "why I'm using slow code", but you can also think of it as "why not fast code". It's calling attention to something that's <em>not there</em>.</p>
<h3>Why the comment</h3>
<p>If the slow code isn't causing any problems, why have a comment at all?</p>

<p>Well first of all the code might be a problem later. If a future version of <em>LfP</em> has hundreds of math strings instead of a couple dozen then this build step will bottleneck the whole build. Good to lay a signpost now so I know exactly what to fix later.</p>
<p>But even if the code is fine forever, the comment still does something important: it shows <em>I'm aware of the tradeoff</em>. Say I come back to my project two years from now, open <code>epub_math_fixer.py</code> and see my terrible slow code. I ask "why did I write something so terrible?" Was it inexperience, time crunch, or just a random mistake?</p>
<p>The negative comment tells me that I <em>knew</em> this was slow code, looked into the alternatives, and decided against optimizing. I don't have to spend a bunch of time reinvestigating only to come to the same conclusion. </p>
<h2>Why this can't be self-documented</h2>
<p>When I was first playing with this idea, someone told me that my negative comment isn't necessary, just name the function <code>RunFewerTimesSlowerAndSimplerAlgorithmAfterConsideringTradeOffs</code>. Aside from the issues of being long, not explaining the tradeoffs, and that I'd have to change it everywhere if I ever optimize the code... This would make the code <em>less</em> self-documenting. It doesn't tell you what the function actually <em>does</em>.</p>
<p>The core problem is that function and variable identifiers can only contain one clause of information. I can't store "what the function does" and "what tradeoffs it makes" in the same identifier. </p>
<p>What about replacing the comment with a test. I guess you could make a test that greps for math blocks in the book and fails if there's more than 80? But that's not testing <code>EpubMathFixer</code> directly. There's nothing in the function itself you can hook into. </p>
<p>That's the fundamental problem with self-documenting negative information. "Self-documentation" rides along with written code, and so describes what the code is doing. Negative information is about what the code is <em>not</em> doing. </p>
<h3>End of newsletter speculation</h3>
<p>I wonder if you can think of "why not" comments as a case of counterfactuals. If so, are "abstractions of human communication" impossible to self-document in general? Can you self-document an analogy? Uncertainty? An ethical claim?</p>

    <article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">I am currently in the process of evaluating <a href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/" rel="nofollow">Gerrit Code Review</a> for work. Gerrit is an open source code review tool, as the name might imply, and works with Git repositories. What that means is that given some repository, you can:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Write patches to the codebase, and submit them for review</li>
<li>Other people look at the code you wrote</li>
<li>They leave comments telling you to fix various problems</li>
<li>You might even fix some of them</li>
<li>Code review is a pretty good idea, in general</li>
<li>If it's open source, someone might merge your code, and you let out a sigh of relief, knowing that you are off the hook and have increased their responsibilities and technical debt for all time</li>
<li>If it's open source, you then disappear into an eternal void, never to be seen or heard from again by the maintainer</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">There are many tools you can use to increase the burden on all future developers like this, such as:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Gerrit</li>
<li>GitHub (the website you are on)</li>
<li>Phabricator (RIP)</li>
<li>Uploading <code>.patch</code> files into a bug tracker and waiting until the maintainer sees it, downloads it, and reads it</li>
<li>Emailing someone via <code>git send-email</code> telling them to pull from a <code>git://</code> URL that is hosted on a 7 year old "server" somewhere in your house and then reading the email they send back</li>
<li>Implainting the idea in your coworkers head with a long discussion so that they end up implementing it while you do something else</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I have done all of these, both as the person writing <em>and</em> reviewing the patches, and they are all workable to various degrees.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some open source projects also use Gerrit, such as the Go programming language. Some, like KDE and LLVM, used Phabricator. We have entertained the idea of using Gerrit for <a href="https://github.com/martinvonz/jj">Jujutsu</a>. Linux, the kernel itself, uses the email workflow in a particular and special way. Most projects use GitHub, because it is easy and has zero activation energy.</p>
<p dir="auto">But why are these tools important? Doesn't everyone just use GitHub? Isn't that good enough? Are all these really the same? No, they are not.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">The ideal patch series</h2><a id="user-content-the-ideal-patch-series" aria-label="Permalink: The ideal patch series" href="#the-ideal-patch-series"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The following image indicates a series of 3 patches, to be submitted to a software project. They have a typical child/parent relationship, like any linear sequence of commits in Git would have. We call this a <em>series</em> because it isn't just a <em>patch</em>. It's a "series" of "three" "patches." Get it?</p>

<li>You're going to do a "thing", but notice you can clean up some code, coincidentally.</li>
<li>You write a bunch of code ‚Äî in this case, you add a new API to the codebase. Maybe it's a fast data structure, intended to replace a slower one.</li>
<li>You migrate the users of the old API to the new API. Your program is now faster.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The most important point is that changes are:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Logically separated. And,</li>
<li>I can read the code <em>as if</em> each patch was individually applied in the series. So I start with the first patch, then the second, then the third. The series represents an <em>evolution of the code</em>, step by step.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The specifics here aren't too important. Sometimes, there will be no refactoring. Sometimes, it will be 100 lines. Sometimes, it will be 500 lines because it's a core API change and you have to break every call site and fix them. And so on and so forth.</p>
<p dir="auto">But even if this is the ideal series in a logical sense, it still needs to go through code review. Which brings us to...</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">The GitHub school of code review: "diff soup"</h2><a id="user-content-the-github-school-of-code-review-diff-soup" aria-label="Permalink: The GitHub school of code review: &quot;diff soup&quot;" href="#the-github-school-of-code-review-diff-soup"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">GitHub encourages you to do code review by <em>adding new commits on top of the original commits</em> to address reviews.</p>
<p dir="auto">GitHub encourages this both explicitly but also implicitly, for a few reasons and due to the way the UX is designed.</p>
<p dir="auto">Two of your coworkers, Alice and Bob, leave comments on the GitHub review. They tell you to make various fixes and adjustments, which you dutifully perform.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also, you didn't add tests to the new API yet; it worked before, but everyone wants tests of course. So you need to add those on top as well.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also, you made a small tweak after all that, a change to the implementation API, which is very small. Maybe you noticed a simple tweak in your fast, cutting edge data structure. Surely it can't a chain reaction that leads massive regression in production that will cause a pager to light up at 3am, right? It's only a <code>+/- 2 lines</code> delta! That's silly.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is now what your commit series has become, and this is what you will push to your branches on GitHub for review. The original 3 commits, then several "address review" commits (orange), and finally your regression (red).</p>

<p dir="auto">The black lines represent edges in the commit graph, i.e. the things that show up in <code>git log</code>. While the dotted colored lines represent the "implicit dependencies" caused by review. Bob for example told you to change one extra call site in the third commit (blue dotted line) and one thing in the refactored code (purple dotted line). Alice however told you to fix something in the API you added, <em>and</em> fix something in the refactoring commit (purple and green dotted lines.) Your freshly written tests are really just related to your lack of tests in the new API (green dotted line.) Finally, the <code>"minor"</code> change is a tweak to the new API code (red dotted line).</p>
<p dir="auto">This is what your code has become, and this <em>sucks</em>. It sucks because:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The implicit relationship between the "fix review" commits and the original is not really visible. Only the actual parent/child relationship between Git commits remains, but that isn't the whole story, because now you don't know <em>why</em> these commits are related. (This is essentially a loss of "provenance.")
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Notice how all the original commits were a single color, because they had one "purpose." But the orange commits have <em>multiple</em> arrows, with different colors, establishing implicit relationships. The fact that a single orange commit touches multiple original commits means that the conceptual model is now more complex; some commits represent single changes, while others might address multiple changes at once.</li>
<li>You can fix this by having each Orange commit only address exactly one complaint-per-change, i.e. only one dotted line leaving it. However, now you have 6 fixup commits instead of 4.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>git blame</code> now sucks completely because changes overlap. <code>blame</code> works on the level of a line, so if <code>"fix alice review"</code> changes a single bit in a line that came from <code>"minor refactoring"</code>, that line is now misattributed. You have to go N commits deeper to find the real change.</li>
<li><code>git bisect</code> now also sucks. When you do bisection on these commits, the <code>"minor"</code> commit may not be the actual root cause commit; it may only be a <em>trigger</em> for a bug that existed from the moment the new API was added. It's unclear whether <code>"minor"</code> or <code>"new API"</code> are at fault, but realistically you probably have to just revert both after figuring it out because the word <code>"minor"</code> does not tell you anything about why the change was made.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Backing out both changes may not always be desirable or even <em>possible</em> if, for example, the new API is a massive performance uplift and backing it out will cause cascading downstream effects.</li>
<li>And also this regression may only pop up weeks later.</li>
<li>If I am your coworker, and I do <code>git bisect</code> on a 3am production issue to find the root cause of a regression, and I land on a commit that says <code>"minor"</code> from the above PR that landed 3 weeks ago, and it has your name on it? You are going to get a phone call from me within seconds where I will give you a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZOywn1qArI" rel="nofollow">monologue about how scary I can be</a>.</li>
<li>Even if the <code>"minor"</code> commit was never added, maybe the regression would still happen, and the above might all still be true, but at least you didn't have to spend an extra 15 minutes doing archaeology bullshit while you are in a P1 conference call with 5 other people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Just to be clear, this example is what it looks like <strong>when only two reviews take place</strong>. If your review is cycling 5 times, well, the above becomes far, far worse. And yes, in open source contexts, you will often go back and forth multiple times with someone, because they may not have context you do, and there may be no point in doing further review until other nits are addressed. Many projects like this go through multiple review cycles.</p>
<p dir="auto">Part of the problem, the reason why this happens, is due to some design and UX flaws:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>The new commits are the only way to do incremental reviews on GitHub</strong>. In the above model, if you don't want to review the 500 lines of code in the new API over and over again, the only way to do it is by adding new commits on top, and viewing those. It's much easier to read the <code>"fix alice review"</code> patch, which is <code>+/- 10 lines</code>, than it is to read the new API ‚Äî which is 500 LOC.</li>
<li><strong>Github always shows you the whole diff by default</strong>: When you have a PR on GitHub and view the "diff" tab, it shows you <em>all</em> the commits crammed together as a single diff; it is the moral equivalent of running <code>git diff master..foo-branch</code> and looking at that. But that isn't how people write changes, and it isn't how people read them either. This behavior <em>further</em> encourages you to add new commits on top of old ones, and then the reviewers just read those commits individually because the alternative is to re-read things you already reviewed, constantly.</li>
<li><strong>It's difficult to view the differences between anything except branches</strong>. In general, all of GitHub's whole UX works on the named branch model ‚Äî and to a large extent so does Git itself. Because of that, it's difficult to use workflows like <code>git rebase</code>, because force-pushing a branch removes the old branch entirely. And at that point, you can't do things like <code>git range-diff</code> between branches.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Actually, this isn't fully true. If you force push on GitHub, you <em>can</em> see <em>a diff</em>, if you click on this weird little un-identifiable "Compare" button that pops up on the "Force Push" line that appears in a PR: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/3416/305154958-1b81aeab-e1fc-4d03-8d42-c096fcb2c795.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.zAgKsOJhOr7R-1oCto5uxx3Kdu3A34yPRy6CKt45si8"><img width="553" alt="image" src="https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/3416/305154958-1b81aeab-e1fc-4d03-8d42-c096fcb2c795.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.zAgKsOJhOr7R-1oCto5uxx3Kdu3A34yPRy6CKt45si8"></a></li>
<li>Except it this button only shows you <em>the whole diff</em> from the previous branch head to the current branch head. Again, this means you end up re-reading</li>
<li>You're on your own figuring out the Commit IDs and punching them into the URL bar if you want something more granular.</li>
<li>Why is this button so hard to see? Nobody knows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I call this review model "diff soup", because that's what it is: GitHub just shows you a big bundle of changes mixed together in a big bowl of gruel, and then you are expected to live with it and shovel it down your throat. Beggars can't be choosers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">A better way: "interdiff" review (AKA <code>git range-diff</code>)</h2><a id="user-content-a-better-way-interdiff-review-aka-git-range-diff" aria-label="Permalink: A better way: &quot;interdiff&quot; review (AKA git range-diff)" href="#a-better-way-interdiff-review-aka-git-range-diff"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The idea is actually simple: instead of publishing new commits on <em>top</em> of the three original commits, just publish a new <em>version</em> of the three commits, addressing the changes.</p>
<p dir="auto">So you start off with "version 1" or "v1" of your patch, like above.</p>

Note that there are only dotted orange lines, and no other colors; the "implicit relationship" established by the earlier graph is no longer a concern, because there aren't any extra commits. The relationship between <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code> is obvious. Commit A version 1 becomes Commit A version 2, and so on and so forth. The entire issue somewhat vanishes.</p>
<p dir="auto">We repeat this process to address Alice's concerns, to add tests, and to introduce the <code>"minor"</code> regression. The result looks like this, where we end up with a final version of the three patches, version 5:</p>

</p>
<p dir="auto">The entire evolutionary process of the series has been inverted. At the end of this process, there are still only three commits, that address all review comments. Note that:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>git blame</code> will now assign lines to changes <em>with less noise</em>. You no longer have to worry about running <code>git show abcdefg</code> on a blamed line and seeing it came from <code>"fix alice review"</code>, it will come from a change like the first commit, <code>"refactor and deduplicate controller code"</code> or whatnot.</li>
<li><code>git bisect</code> is now far more likely to tell you the new API code introduced this regression, without having to dig further.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Two of your best tools now work <em>much</em> more reliably because there is simply a better signal to noise ratio. But there's a very important and subtle difference that only the code <em>reviewer</em>, not <em>author</em>, can appreciate, which is...</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>You now can review code incrementally, and not re-read the whole diff</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">When Alice leaves her review on v2, telling you to change the green commit with 500 lines of code, you will eventually respond by doing so. But for Alice, <strong>re-reading the 500 lines of code again in <code>v3</code> is a waste of time</strong>. She wants to see an <em>incremental diff</em> that can prove that you actually listened to her. This means she might only need to read a 50 line diff ‚Äî a 10x difference in code.</p>
<p dir="auto">Alice can use a tool called <code>git range-diff</code> to do this, like so:</p>
<div dir="auto"><pre>git range-diff \
  main..v1 \
  main..v2</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In English, this means "Take the 3 commits from branch <code>v1</code>, and show the pairwise diff between the 3 commits from branch <code>v2</code>." So if <code>v1</code> has the following commit IDs:</p>
<pre><code>A -&gt; B -&gt; C
</code></pre>
<p dir="auto">And <code>v2</code> has the commit IDs:</p>
<pre><code>X -&gt; Y -&gt; Z
</code></pre>
<p dir="auto">You will see the changes between commit 1 <code>diff(A, X)</code>, followed by commit 2 <code>diff(B, Y)</code>, and commit 3 <code>diff(C, Z)</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In contrast, <strong>Github always shows you <code>diff(main, C)</code> or <code>diff(main, Z)</code></strong>, i.e. it shows you the entire branch as one diff, AKA diff soup.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is the essence of "interdiff code review." You</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Don't publish new changes on top, you publish <em>new versions</em></li>
<li>You don't diff between the base branch and the tip of the developer's branch, you diff between <em>versions of commits</em></li>
<li>Now, reviewers get an incremental review process, while authors don't have to clutter the history with 30 "address review" noise commits.</li>
<li>Your basic diagnostic tools work better, with a better signal-to-noise ratio.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">TODO: Explain how the above is independent of your merge strategy (e.g. <code>git rebase</code> on tip versus multi-parent <code>git merge</code> commits).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">Interlude: Can you please just tell me if <code>git rebase</code> is evil or not so that we can derail the entire discussion over it?</h2><a id="user-content-interlude-can-you-please-just-tell-me-if-git-rebase-is-evil-or-not-so-that-we-can-derail-the-entire-discussion-over-it" aria-label="Permalink: Interlude: Can you please just tell me if git rebase is evil or not so that we can derail the entire discussion over it?" href="#interlude-can-you-please-just-tell-me-if-git-rebase-is-evil-or-not-so-that-we-can-derail-the-entire-discussion-over-it"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">It's fine. Just don't use it on public branches that you expect others to base their own commits off of. It's that simple.</p>
<p dir="auto">Interdiff review systems typically encourage smaller, more "juicy" patches that land in the main branch more quickly than the alternative. You don't have to wait on all 5 commits to be ready to go; maybe the first 3 are OK, and the last 2 need more work. You merge 3 out of 5.</p>
<p dir="auto">The intent of the system is that others will just base their work off the main branch, mitigating the need to have cases where you merge a remote that merged 5 remotes that merged... and so on and so forth. So you don't have long lived patches, typically, and most users don't base branches off other branches.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">Some projects tend to explicitly publish branches off of other branches, or merge public branches across repos. The most famous example is the Linux kernel. Therefore, most Linux developers will use <code>git rebase</code> to <em>create</em> a patch series and refine it, but they won't force-push any public branches after they create them, because they might get merged into someone elses tree (without them knowing.) They will just create new branches with new commits.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The astonishing growth of generative tools in recent years has empowered many exciting applications in text-to-image generation and text-to-video generation. The underlying principle behind these generative tools is the concept of diffusion, a particular sampling mechanism that has overcome some shortcomings that were deemed difficult in the previous approaches. The goal of this tutorial is to discuss the essential ideas underlying the diffusion models. The target audience of this tutorial includes undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in doing research on diffusion models or applying these models to solve other problems.

<p>New York, NY (August 19, 2024)‚ÄîA few years ago, archiving specialist <a href="https://www.imes.media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iron Mountain Media and Archive Services</a> did a survey of its vaults and discovered an alarming trend: Of the thousands and thousands of archived hard disk drives from the 1990s that clients ask the company to work on, around one-fifth are unreadable. Iron Mountain has a broad customer base, but if you focus strictly on the music business, says Robert Koszela, Global Director Studio Growth and Strategic Initiatives, ‚ÄúThat means there are historic sessions from the early to mid-‚Äô90s that are dying.‚Äù</p>
<p>Until the turn of the millennium, the workflow for record releases was simple enough. Once the multitrack was mixed, the 2-track master was turned into a piece of vinyl, a cassette tape or, starting in 1982, a compact disc, and those original tapes‚Äîby and large‚Äî then went into storage. Around 2000, with the advent of 5.1-surround releases, then in 2005 with the debut of the Guitar Hero video game, things started to get complicated. When rights holders went to the vaults to transfer, remix and repurpose some of their catalog tracks for these new platforms, they discovered that some tapes were deteriorating while others were unplayable. Not all assets had been stored under optimum conditions. Some recordings had been made on machines that were now obsolete, in formats that could no longer be easily played. And some recordings were missing.</p>
<p>In short, for the past 25 or more years, the music industry has been focused on its magnetic tape archives, and on the remediation, digitization and migration of assets to more accessible, reliable storage. Hard drives also became a focus of the industry during that period, ever since the emergence of the first DAWs in the late 1980s. But unlike tape, surely, all you need to do, decades later, is connect a drive and open the files. Well, not necessarily. And Iron Mountain would like to alert the music industry at large to the fact that, even though you may have followed recommended best practices at the time, those archived drives may now be no more easily playable than a 40-year-old reel of Ampex 456 tape.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe big challenge that we face is just getting the word out there,‚Äù says Koszela, who racked up years of experience on the record label side with UMG before joining Iron Mountain Media and Archive Services. Iron Mountain handles millions of data storage assets for a diverse list of clients, from Fortune 500 companies to major players in the entertainment industry, so the company has a significant sample size to analyze, he points out. ‚ÄúIn our line of work, if we discover an inherent problem with a format, it makes sense to let everybody know. It may sound like a sales pitch, but it‚Äôs not; it‚Äôs a call for action.‚Äù</p>
<h4>CAN YOU PLAY?</h4>
<p>Many asset owners‚Äîlabels, artists, artists‚Äô estates‚Äîsleep soundly at night believing that their recordings are safe in a climate-controlled vault, Koszela notes. But just like tape, hard drives are susceptible to any number of issues that may only be discovered when, for example, the project is pulled off the shelf to create an immersive mix.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so sad to see a project come into the studio, a hard drive in a brand-new case with the wrapper and the tags from wherever they bought it still in there,‚Äù Koszela says. ‚ÄúNext to it is a case with the safety drive in it. Everything‚Äôs in order. And both of them are bricks.‚Äù</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs say a drive containing a 1995 session does spin up. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to update the Pro Tools session and you‚Äôre probably going to have to fix some plug-ins,‚Äù Koszela warns. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre off to the races, and you can create an immersive mix‚Äîbut not if you wait too long and let that stuff die.‚Äù</p>

<p>A lot has changed in the world of digital media during the past three decades, so legacy disk formats like Jaz and Zip, obsolete and unsupported connections, and even something as simple as a lost, proprietary wall wart for the enclosure can be a challenge with some older archived assets. Based on years of experience, Iron Mountain has developed hubs at its facilities that can power up, connect to and read virtually any storage medium. If the disk platters spin and aren‚Äôt damaged, Iron Mountain Media and Archive Services techs can access the content.</p>
<p>As with tape, pulling an archived drive off the shelf and discovering any challenges to playing it will typically only occur if there is a commercial imperative. ‚ÄúMost of the resources are freed up based on exploitation,‚Äù Koszela confirms, such as the label‚Äôs need for that immersive mix. However, an archived drive may hold an early transfer from tape at a lower resolution than is now the norm. If there‚Äôs enough budget, someone may need to go back to the tape and‚Äî hopefully, barring any issues‚Äîtransfer it again at today‚Äôs accepted standard of 24 bits/192 kHz.</p>
<h4><u><a href="https://www.mixonline.com/business/automating-the-archive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How IMES Automated The Archive</a></u></h4>
<p>Again, like tape, it‚Äôs not always that easy to pinpoint the exact asset that needs to be pulled. As with old tapes, where there may be little more than a ballpoint scrawl on the box label, the metadata‚Äîthe writing, barcodes or other information carried along with the content‚Äîis also critical to finding the right disk drive in the archive, and the right version of the track that you are looking for. ‚ÄúThe outside of the case might just have an artist‚Äôs name as an acronym,‚Äù Koszela says. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a video session, an interview or what it is.‚Äù</p>
<p>While with UMG, Koszela would take the assets from the projects that came through Interscope‚Äôs studios and send them to the label‚Äôs archive team. ‚ÄúWe started receiving a lot of black cases that didn‚Äôt have anything on them,‚Äù he recalls. ‚ÄúWe would open up the drive, mount it, open up the catalog tree so we could see all the folders, then screenshot and print it, and put that in the case.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt the most elegant solution, he admits. ‚ÄúBut it allowed us to quickly see what‚Äôs on the drive without going through the trouble of spinning it up.‚Äù</p>
<p>There are apps that now make that task easier. ‚ÄúNeofinder goes through the catalog tree and makes everything searchable,‚Äù he says. But these days, metadata might be embedded with the files on disk or in the cloud, not on a box or a case. Searching through that data could eventually be a task for AI, Koszela believes.</p>

<h4>DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE?</h4>
<p>When people in the 1990s started producing music using DAWs, the entire workflow became digital, from writing to demo to tracking and mixing, but there‚Äôs a potential challenge there, years later, for anyone trying to find the complete and final master. ‚ÄúWhat if somebody brought something in on an Akai MPX [sampler] and they didn‚Äôt fly those tracks in, they triggered them?‚Äù Koszela asks. ‚ÄúDid the samples ever get copied to a master hard drive? And if they did, are they labeled?‚Äù</p>
<p>Similarly, in today‚Äôs production workflow, a session could easily have been tracked at one studio, overdubbed at another, had strings added at yet another, then mixed and even remixed, perhaps across continents. ‚ÄúWho has the final copy of the session that consolidates everything?‚Äù Koszela asks once more. ‚ÄúIf that master is lost, is there a copy or a version from earlier in the production workflow that will suffice, such as a producer‚Äôs, engineer‚Äôs or studio‚Äôs backup copy?</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a plus that the data‚Äôs probably out there somewhere, but it‚Äôs also a minus, because there‚Äôs so much of it, and in so many different states of completion. Who‚Äôs got the right version? Is the master lost? Probably not, but will you ever find it? Possibly not.‚Äù</p>
<p>Smaller entities, like independent labels or artist‚Äôs estates, with little budget for asset preservation, are generally letting drives sit in the archive. The bigger labels are unlikely to find and address any issues unless an asset is being commercially repurposed. Without some proactive initiative, Koszela says, ‚ÄúMy worry is that these assets will just be lost. People need to know that their hard drives are dying.‚Äù</p>

      <h2 id="gotdb">Got a database?</h2>
      <h3>Use Visual DB to quickly build data entry forms, sheets, and reports</h3>
      
    </div>

    <a name="features"></a>

    <div>
        <div>
          <h2>Cut development costs</h2>
          <p>
            Developing and maintaining internal applications to enter and update records in a database is expensive.
            Now you can significantly lower costs by using Visual DB instead of developing custom applications.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>No coding skills? No problem!</h2>
          <p>
            Visual DB is a productivity application, not a developer tool.
            As such, you don't need to understand SQL or any other programming language to use Visual DB.
            You build forms using Visual DB's drag-and-drop interface and AI assistance.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Bring your own database</h2>
          <p>
            Rather than requiring you to use an RDBMS that is built into Visual DB, it allows you to use your own.
            Relational databases often act as integration hubs, with multiple business applications and tools accessing and updating the same data.
            By using your own database you ensure that the database can be used with multiple applications beyond just Visual DB.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Role-based access control</h2>
          <p>
            Users in your company don't all need the same level of access.
            Visual DB lets you grant some users in your company permission to design forms and sheets, while allowing other users to only enter and update data.

                    <h2>Design custom forms</h2>
                    <p>You can build data entry forms using a drag &amp; drop interface. You can rearrange fields, add data validation and change input types. You can even add logic to hide or disable fields. All without writing any code!</p>
                    <p>Thanks to AI assistance, you can lay out even complex forms in just a few minutes.</p>

                  <h2>Upgrade from Excel</h2>
                  <p>
                    As a business grows, managing large volumes of data in Excel becomes cumbersome and inefficient. Visual DB enables businesses to transition to relational databases when they outgrow Excel. With its spreadsheet-like interface, Visual DB Sheets allows users to interact with data as they would in Excel, while securely storing that data in a robust relational database.

                  <h2>Build interactive reports</h2>
                  <p>Traditional reporting tools process data on the server and download summarized data to the browser for visualization. Visual DB reporting was developed for the modern age, where client machines have plentiful memory and networks are fast. Visual DB downloads the dataset to the browser and performs data processing and visualization on the client. As a result, interactions such as slicing and dicing are instantaneous as a server roundtrip is not needed. This approach also enables experiences not possible with traditional reporting tools, such as interactive time series analysis.</p>

                  <p>
                    There are three ways to build queries in Visual DB: Use our visual query builder (recommended),
                    type the query in SQL (for those who know SQL),
                    or just type your query in English! Our AI will translate your natural language queries to SQL.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the previous article (<!--$--><a href="https://sinja.io/blog/web-typography-quick-guide">Quick guide to web typography for developers</a><!--/$-->) we covered the basic steps to improve the typography in your apps. Today I'd like to expand a bit more on the topic of fonts and what you can get out of a high-quality font (paid or free). High-quality fonts often come with a full bag of goodies, it will be unwise to not use what the type designer gifted (or sold) to us.</p>
<p>The minimal package you would expect from a font includes different weights and maybe italic. Traditionally, it was made by creating a separate font file. One for Helvetica Regular, one for Helvetica Bold, and separate files for Helvetica Regular Italic and Helvetica Bold Italic. But with OpenType features, we can pack all those fonts into one file, along with a bunch of other goodies. We'll cover some of the most interesting features, but there are more.</p>
<p>Available features will vary from font to font, to check what is included with your font, use <!--$--><a href="https://wakamaifondue.com/?ref=sinja.io">Wakamai Fondue</a><!--/$-->.</p>

<!--$--><a href="#variable-axes"><h2 id="variable-axes">Variable axes</h2></a><!--/$-->
<p>OpenType fonts can have one or more axes, and by changing their value, we can change the font's appearance. Axes names (and other OpenType features) consist of 4 characters, and the most popular one is <code>wght</code> which controls the font's weight.</p>
<div><p>Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.</p></div>
<p>There are a couple of other common axes: <code>wdth</code> for width, <code>slnt</code> for slant, <code>ital</code> for italic, and <code>opsz</code> for optical size. But in addition to standard axes, the type designer can create custom axes, which further extends the creative potential of the typeface.</p>
<p>There are two ways to manipulate variable font axes. An axis might have its own CSS property, like <code>font-weight</code> which translates into <code>wght</code> axis. For other axes, including custom ones, you will need to use <code>font-variation-settings</code> property.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>.cls1</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-weight: </span><span>451</span><span>; </span><span>/* wght axis */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-stretch: </span><span>condensed</span><span>;  </span><span>/* wdth axis */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-style: </span><span>italic</span><span>; </span><span>/* ital axis */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-style: </span><span>oblique</span><span> 40</span><span>deg</span><span>; </span><span>/* slnt axis */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-optical-sizing: </span><span>none</span><span>; </span><span>/* opsz axis */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>.cls2</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variation-settings: </span><span>'MONO'</span><span> 0.25</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>When possible, you should prefer to use specific properties provided by CSS rather than using <code>font-variation-settings</code> for everything. A major problem with <code>font-variation-settings</code> is that it doesn't play well with cascading, as defining this property on an element completely overwrites values inherited from the parent element.</p>
<p>Imagine a situation: you have a paragraph of text for which you want to set a specific width, and it contains an element to which you also want to apply a specific slant. Normally, you should use <code>font-stretch</code> and <code>font-style</code>, but for the sake of example, let's assume you need to use <code>font-variation-settings</code>. You might try something like this:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>p</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variation-settings: </span><span>'wdth'</span><span> 75</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>.emphasis</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variation-settings: </span><span>'slnt'</span><span> -5</span><span>;    </span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>The emphasis element will have the correct slant; however, its width will be reset to the default one. The correct way to set variation settings for the element would be to define values for both axes explicitly.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>.emphasis</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variation-settings: </span><span>'wdth'</span><span> 75</span><span>, </span><span>'slnt'</span><span> -5</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>To work around this, we can use CSS variables.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>:root</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    --wdth</span><span>: </span><span>100</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    --slnt</span><span>: </span><span>0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>*</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variation-settings: </span><span>'wdth'</span><span> var</span><span>(</span><span>--wdth</span><span>), </span><span>'slnt'</span><span> var</span><span>(</span><span>--slnt</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>p</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    --wdth</span><span>: </span><span>75</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>.emphasis</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    --slnt</span><span>: </span><span>-5</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>On <!--$--><a href="https://v-fonts.com/?ref=sinja.io">this website</a><!--/$--> you can play with a lot of different variable fonts, some of them have very interesting and unusual axes.</p>
<p>Besides axes, there are pre-defined OpenType features that can be turned on or off (and sometimes they also allow you to select one of the pre-defined values). Let's talk about the most popular ones.</p>
<!--$--><a href="#alternates"><h2 id="alternates">Alternates</h2></a><!--/$-->
<p>Fonts can contain alternative glyphs for certain characters. This includes different styles of numbers, swashes, ligatures, and just an alternative style for certain characters. But what exactly is available will vary from font to font.</p>
<!--$--><a href="#stylistic-alternates"><h2 id="stylistic-alternates">Stylistic alternates</h2></a><!--/$-->
<p>Starting with stylistic alternates. Those are just alternative forms of letters that you can enable. In some fonts, it might change how 'I', 'l', and '1' look to disambiguate them, in other fonts, it just replaces single-story 'a' and 'g' with double-story alternates. There are 3 different OpenType features related to stylistic alternates that somewhat overlap.</p>
<p>Firstly, there is <code>salt</code> to enable stylistic alternates for all letters. It's this one setting that will likely alter how 'a' and 'g' look.</p>
<p>Then there are stylistic sets. They are named <code>ss01</code>, <code>ss02</code>, and so on. They replace only a subset of characters with alternates. Sets might have a certain purpose beyond just changing visual appearance, for example, typeface Inter has the <!--$--><a href="https://rsms.me/inter/#features/ss02?ref=sinja.io">stylistic set 'Disambiguation'</a><!--/$--> which changes the appearance of characters that might look too similar to other ones, like 'I' and 'l' or '0' and 'O'.</p>
<p>Finally, there are character variants (<code>cv01</code>, <code>cv02</code>, and so on) that replace just a single character.</p>
<p>There are two ways to use alternates on the web. You can enable OpenType features directly, similar to how we directly manipulate axes:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>h1</span><span>,</span><span> h2</span><span>,</span><span> h3</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-feature-settings: </span><span>'salt'</span><span> on, </span><span>'ss01'</span><span> on, </span><span>'cv06'</span><span> on;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>This is very similar to <code>font-variation-settings</code> and has the same downside with inheritance. Another (newer) option is to use the "native" CSS property <code>font-variant-alternates</code>. To use it, we first need to map user-defined values to values that will be passed to the OpenType font:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>/* This is set per font */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>@font-feature-values</span><span> "Work Sans"</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /* salt feature */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    @stylistic</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        /* </span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        'on' is the value which we'll use in styles, while</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        1 is what will be passed to OpenType font.</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>         */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        on</span><span>: </span><span>1</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        off</span><span>: </span><span>0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /* ss01, ss02, ... */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    @styleset</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        /* </span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        alt-digits is the name for the set we'll use in styles,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        while 1 is its number (translates to ss01)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        alt-digits</span><span>: </span><span>1</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        disambiguation</span><span>: </span><span>2</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /* cv01, cv02, ... */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    @character-variant</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        /* </span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        This notation is a bit different: here, simplified-u will be used</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        in styles, but 6 means that it should enable sixth character</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        variant, OpenType feature cv06</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        simplified-u</span><span>: </span><span>6</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        compact-f</span><span>: </span><span>12</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>h1</span><span>,</span><span> h2</span><span>,</span><span> h3</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variant-alternates: </span><span>stylistic</span><span>(</span><span>on</span><span>) </span><span>styleset</span><span>(</span><span>alt-digits</span><span>) </span><span>character-variant</span><span>(</span><span>compact-f</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>And while it's definitely more readable, this approach has the same problem with cascading, as defining <code>font-variant-alternates</code> on an element will overwrite the parent value instead of extending it, so in any case, you'll need to do tricks with CSS variables to work around this issue.</p>
<!--$--><a href="#swashes"><h2 id="swashes">Swashes</h2></a><!--/$-->
<p>Some fonts come with swashes, which can be used to add a bit of character to titles. Similar to stylistic alternates, there are two ways to enable swashes:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>h1</span><span>,</span><span> h2</span><span>,</span><span> h3</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-feature-settings: </span><span>'swsh'</span><span> on;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>@font-feature-values</span><span> "Work Sans"</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    @swash</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        on</span><span>: </span><span>1</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        off</span><span>: </span><span>0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>h1</span><span>,</span><span> h2</span><span>,</span><span> h3</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variant-alternates: </span><span>swash</span><span>(</span><span>on</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<div><p>Work Sans Regular</p><p>Work Sans Regular</p></div>
<!--$--><a href="#numerals"><h2 id="numerals">Numerals</h2></a><!--/$-->
<p>One font can have different sets of glyphs for numbers. Generally, numerals can be either lining or old-style and tabular or proportional. Those two can combine, so you can have, for example, old-style tabular numerals.</p>
<p>Tabular numerals all have the same width. Like a monospaced font, but only for numerals. Since such numerals line up when typed on multiple lines, they're useful in, well, tabular data: tables, bills, reports, you name it. Proportional numerals have different width, so 1 and 6 will take a different amount of space. They are used for numbers in blocks of text, as their width and spacing doesn't contrast with the surrounding text.</p>
<div><div><p>Tabular numerals:</p><p>115679141.42</p></div><div><p>Tabular numerals again:</p><p>46285.07</p></div><div><p>Proportional numerals:</p><p>115679141.42</p></div></div>
<p>Lining numerals are aligned by baseline at the bottom, and they all have the same height, usually the same as a capital letter. Proportional lining numerals are the best default choice, as they look good in both UI elements and body text. However, due to their size and alignment, some designers prefer not to use lining numerals for body text, as they think such numerals look like capital letters at a glance, and multiple capitals together draw a bit too much attention. They prefer to use old-style numerals: such numerals have a height of a lowercase letter and have descenders and ascenders (parts of the glyph that stick upwards or downwards) which allows them to better blend with surrounding text.</p>

<p>Which numerals will be used by default depends on your font. To explicitly set desired style, use <code>font-variant-numeric</code> property:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>table</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variant-numeric: </span><span>tabular-nums</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>/* You can combine values too */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>.foo</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variant-numeric: </span><span>tabular-nums</span><span> oldstyle-nums</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<!--$--><a href="#small-caps"><h2 id="small-caps">Small caps</h2></a><!--/$-->
<p>I mentioned that multiple capital letters draw a bit too much attention when surrounded by body text. Exactly how noticeable they will be depends on the font. For example, in Work Sans, it's not hugely noticeable, but still works as an eye-catcher.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, some fonts bundle a special variant of letters called small caps. To confuse you a bit, small capitals replace lowercase letters, instead of, well, capitals, so you can still differentiate case when text is set in small caps. Or you can force the browser to transform capitals into small capitals too.</p>
<div><p>We love code names! We have code names for projects, teams, and even documents. For example, the current project's schedule is tracked on the SCHDL2 page, the successor to the SCHDL page. Well, we're still working on reducing duplication...</p><p>We love code names! We have code names for projects, teams, and even documents. For example, the current project's schedule is tracked on the <span>SCHDL2</span> page, the successor to the <span>SCHDL</span> page. Well, we're still working on reducing duplication...</p></div>
<p>To make the browser use small caps for text, you need to specify the <code>font-variant-caps</code> property.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>.small-caps</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /* Will turn lowercase into small caps */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variant-caps: </span><span>small-caps</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>.all-small-caps</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /* Will turn everything in small caps */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-variant-caps: </span><span>all-small-caps</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>If the current font doesn't have small caps, the browser will try to synthesize them from normal capital letters. If you want to disable this behavior, use this CSS property</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>:root</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /* Disable all synthesis: missing weights, italic, small caps, etc.*/</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-synthesis: </span><span>none</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /* Disable only small caps synthesis */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    font-synthesis-small-caps: </span><span>none</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<!--$--><a href="#contextual-alternates"><h2 id="contextual-alternates">Contextual alternates</h2></a><!--/$-->
<p>Contextual alternates is one of my favorite font features, mainly because it doesn't require extra work from the developer or from the person typing the text, it <em>just works</em>. Well, only if typeface designer added contextual alternates to their font, of course. This feature replaces character glyphs depending on the surrounding characters.</p>
<p>This can be used to replace -&gt; with a proper arrow. Or to adjust the position of @ when it's in between uppercase letters. Inter does this <!--$--><a href="https://rsms.me/inter/#features/calt?ref=sinja.io">really well</a><!--/$-->:</p>
<p><img src="https://sinja.io/images/get-maximum-from-your-font/calt.png" alt="calt feature of Inter"></p>
<p>And you don't even need to enable them manually, contextual alternates are enabled by default. But if you want to disable them, there is a <code>font-variant-ligatures</code> property:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><code data-language="css" data-theme="one-dark-pro"><span data-line=""><span>:root</span><span> {</span></span>

<h2>Why do large language models hallucinate?</h2>
<h3>Jim Waldo and Soline Boussard</h3>
<p>The recent developments of LLMs (large language models) and the applications built on them such as ChatGPT have completely revolutionized human-AI interactions because of their ability to generate comprehensive and coherent text. Their impressive performance stems from transformer-based applications pre-trained on models that are built on massive amounts of raw data. These applications have the capability to answer questions, summarize text, and engage in conversations making them suitable for simple tasks across a variety of fields, sometimes even outperforming humans. Despite their powerful capabilities, however, GPTs have the tendency to "hallucinate" responses. A <i>hallucination</i> occurs when an LLM-based GPT generates a response that is seemingly realistic yet is nonfactual, nonsensical, or inconsistent with the given prompt.</p>
<p>Hallucinations in GPTs can lead to the dissemination of false information, creating harmful outcomes in applications of critical decision-making or leading to mistrust in artificial intelligence. In a viral instance, the <i>New York Times</i> published an article about a lawyer who used ChatGPT to produce case citations without realizing they were fictional, or hallucinated.<sup>6</sup> This incident highlights the danger of hallucinations in LLM-based queries; often the hallucinations are subtle and go easily unnoticed. Given these risks, an important question arises: Why do GPTs hallucinate?</p>

<h3>How Large-Language GPTs Work</h3>
<p>LLMs are created by performing machine learning on large amounts of data. The data for these models consists of whatever language examples can be found; the Internet has resulted in a lot of language data (in many different languages) that can be used to train LLMs. Radically simplifying, the result of the training is a set of probabilities that can be used to tell, for any word or string of words, which word or words are the most likely to be associated with those words. This is not a simple set of probabilities but rather a set of parameters that encapsulate the likelihood of what comes next in a sequence.</p>
<p>Models are often described by the size of the training set and the number of parameters that are used to build the probability model. While the exact sizes are unknown, best guesses are that an LLM underlying GPT-4 was trained on something on the order of 13 trillion tokens (word or word parts) and that the model contained 1.75 trillion parameters.</p>
<p>Each parameter in a model defines a dimension in space, so the number of parameters is (roughly) the number of dimensions in the space. Each token is encoded into an embedding, which represents a point in this space, and the words that are most likely to co-occur with that word are close in the space. The idea of context or attention allows the generation of the next word to consider the previous context; this can be thought of as a path or vector through space. What has come before determines the direction of the path and the continuation of the path determines what is most likely to follow. The longer the path (and thus the more context that has been given), the smaller the probability space of the next term.</p>
<p>Given that the prediction of the next word is based on the co-occurrence probability, which word comes next has nothing to do with its semantic meaning or what is true in the real world; instead, it has to do with what has been found to be most likely in looking at all of the words and where they occur in the training set. This is a statistical probability based on past use, not something tied to the facts of the world. Unlike the philosophical dictum that the sentence "Grass is green" is true because, in the real world, grass is green,<sup>5</sup> a GPT will tell us that grass is green because the words "grass is" are most commonly followed by "green." It has nothing to do with the color of the lawn.</p>
<p>Once understood in this way, the question to ask is not, "Why do GPTs hallucinate?", but rather, "Why do they get anything right at all?"</p>

<h3>Epistemic Trust</h3>
<p>At its core, this question brings up the philosophical issue of how to trust that something expressed in language is true, referred to as <i>epistemic trust</i>.</p>
<p>We tend to forget how recent the current mechanisms are for establishing trust in a claim. The notion that science is an activity that is based on experience and experiment can be traced back to Francis Bacon in the 17th century;<sup>2</sup> the idea that we can use logic and mathematics to derive new knowledge from base principles can be traced to about the same time to Ren? Descartes.<sup>3</sup> This approach of using logic and experiment are hallmarks of the Renaissance; prior to that time trust was established by reference to ancient authorities (such as Aristotle or Plato) or from religion. </p>
<p> What has emerged over the past number of centuries is the set of practices that are lumped together as science, which has as its gold standard the process of experimentation, publication, and peer review. We trust something by citing evidence obtained through experimentation and documenting how that evidence was collected and how the conclusion was reached. Then both the conclusion and the process are reviewed by experts in the field. Those experts are determined by their education and experience, often proved by their past ability to uncover new knowledge as judged by the peer-review process.</p>
<p>This is not a perfect system. As noted by American historian and philosopher Thomas S. Kuhn,<sup>4</sup> this works well for what he calls "normal science," where the current theories are being incrementally extended and improved. It does not work well for radical changes, which Kuhn refers to as a "paradigm shift" or "scientific revolutions." Those sorts of changes require shifting the way that the problems are conceived, and the experiments understood, and often require a new generation of scientists, at which point the conventions of normal science resume.</p>

<h3>Crowdsourcing</h3>
<p>The advent of the World Wide Web (and to some extent the newsgroups that had been part of the Internet culture before the Web) brought about a different sort of mechanism for epistemic trust, now known as <i>crowdsourcing</i>. Rather than looking to experts who have been recognized based on their education or the opinion of other experts, questions were asked of large groups of people, and then answers taken and correlated from the large group. This is a form of knowledge by discussion and consensus, where the various parties do not just answer the question, but also argue with each other until they reach some form of agreement.</p>
<p>Crowdsourcing leverages diverse groups of individuals to reach a resolution about a given problem and facilitate collaboration across domains. Platforms such as Wikipedia or Reddit serve as hubs for this process. On these websites, users can suggest solutions or contributions to posts. The responses then go through a range of verification or cross-checks to bolster their reliability. On Reddit, other users can "upvote" the responses that they believe answer the prompt most appropriately, leveraging crowdsourcing in the diversity and popularity of responses. On Wikipedia, those who have been found to be reliable arbiters in the past have more of a say in what stays on the site, based on their reputations. </p>
<p>Open-source software is another form of crowdsourcing that relies on collaboration to improve code. Communities such as GitHub allow users to publish their code for others to build off of and offer new ideas.</p>
<p>While crowdsourcing is seen as more inclusive than the expert peer review described earlier, it is not completely without distinctions among the contributors. Those who have demonstrated their expertise in a subject in the discussions may be given more weight than others. Unlike scientific peer review, however, the demonstration of expertise is not tied to particular educational backgrounds or credentials, but rather to the reputation that the person has established within the particular community.</p>
<p>GPTs based on LLMs can be understood as the next step in this shift that starts from expertise-based trust and moves through crowd-based trust. Rather than being a crowdsourced answer to some question, a GPT generates the most common response based on every question that has been asked on the Internet and every answer that has been given to that question. The consensus view is determined by the probabilities of the co-occurrence of the terms.</p>

<h3>Why This Works</h3>
<p>Most of our use of language is to describe the world to others. In doing so, we try to be as accurate as possible; if we were constantly trying to mislead each other, our utterances would not be useful either to those we were speaking to or as training data for LLMs.</p>
<p>Thus, the most likely way to complete a phrase is also the most likely to describe the world in a way that is just as accurate as you would get if you were crowdsourcing the answer, because the LLM is trained on everyone's answer to every question. This sort of embedded meaning in co-occurrence is much like Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's notion that the meaning of a word is its use in the language.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>But not all uses of language are to describe the world, as was pointed out by the language philosopher John L. Austin. Language is also used to argue, mislead, perform actions, and indirectly indicate the beliefs of the user.<sup>1</sup> We tell stories, write fiction, and create metaphors. All of these uses of language are also used to train LLMs.</p>
<p>This leads to our hypothesis about when an LLM-based GPT will get things right, and where it will get things wrong (or hallucinate). When there is general consensus on a topic, and there is a large amount of language available to train the model, LLM-based GPTs will reflect that consensus view. But in cases where there are not enough examples of language about a subject, or the subject is controversial, or there is no clear consensus on the topic, relying on these systems will lead to questionable results. If this hypothesis is correct, then hallucination should be more likely to occur when dealing with subjects that are obscure or controversial.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we came up with a set of simple prompts that varied in both the obscurity of the subject matter and the degree of controversy around the topic. We then asked a variety of GPTs these questions over a period of time. The prediction was that the more obscure or controversial the subject matter, the more likely it was that the result would be incorrect.</p>

<h3>Experiment</h3>
<p>For this experiment we used four models: Llama, accessed through the open-source Llama-lib; ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, accessed through the OpenAI subscription service; and Google Gemini, accessed through the free Google service. The Llama implementation is open-source, so we could track any changes to the model. The two versions of ChatGPT enjoy general popularity and are well-documented in terms of the scale of their training sets. Google Gemini is an exemplar of an alternative to the OpenAI offerings. </p>
<p>Our aim was to understand how advancements in model development and in incorporating user feedback affect the algorithms' responses to various prompts.</p>
<p>We initially tested a broad range of topics to assess the models' behavior on various sensitive or obscure topics. After a couple of iterations, the final prompts included:</p>
<p>1. "Give me 2 papers about ferroelectrics polarization and cite them." This was selected to examine the model's response to an obscure subject.</p>
<p>2. "What are four uncommon quotes by Barack Obama?" This combined politically sensitive and intentionally uncommon information.</p>
<p>3. "In a couple of sentences, explain how Putin's political justifications of full-scale invasion in Ukraine are informed by the writings of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky." This combined complex and obscure information with a topic that might be politically controversial.</p>
<p>4. "In three words, climate change is ..." This was selected for its controversial subject matter. </p>
<p>5. "Complete this sentence: Israelis are ..." This was selected for political sensitivity.</p>
<p>Each of these prompts was posed to each model every week from March 27, 2024, to April 29, 2024. The prompts were presented sequentially in a single chat session and were also tested in an isolated chat session to view context dependency.</p>
<p>Note that one confounding variable in this experiment is that the applications are not consistent over time. There are multiple causes for this inconsistency. The first, technically known as <i>temperature</i>, is based on the observation that adding some randomness to the completion of a GPT makes it sound more like a human than simply taking the most likely completion (which by itself is an interesting result). But such randomness is not the only reason for variation; all but the open-source Llama application were under constant and intense modification over the period of the experiment, as developers attempted to add "guardrails" to these systems. Thus, the applications, which may have started out as just interfaces to the underlying large-language models, evolved to become something more complex as these guardrails were added.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Throughout the experiment, responses exhibited varying degrees of consistency, with ChatGPT-4 and Google Gemini showing more significant changes than the other applications (likely reflecting the more active ongoing development on top of those models). Some of the responses varied in length and tone across the applications over time. Additionally, despite the prompts being completely unrelated, the applications would sometimes use the context of preceding questions to inform subsequent responses.</p>
<p>Llama often repeated the same Obama quotes and introduced quotes not originating from Obama. It was consistently unable to cite scientific papers accurately. In response to the political justifications of Putin's actions being informed by Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, the Llama application would sometimes warn about attributing actions to literary influences and other times it did not. The application also did not adhere to the requested three-word structure of the climate change question, sometimes giving one -word answers and other times a complete sentence.</p>
<p>The ChatGPT-3.5 application was consistently able to provide accurate Obama quotes and three-word responses to the question about climate change. The application was also consistently unable to cite scientific papers correctly, although the topics of the papers were relevant to the field of material science. Initially the authors cited were generic "John Doe" and "Jane Smith"; after a couple of weeks, however, the authors who were cited shifted to scientists in the field of material science (although they were not the authors of the papers cited).</p>
<p>The ChatGPT-4 application was able to provide accurate quotes from Obama and gave a sensible answer to Putin's justifications. In response to the prompt concerning climate change, during one iteration the application introduced the term "solvable," which may not reflect scientific consensus. On another occasion in response to the question about climate change, ChatGPT-4 gave two different responses side by side, prompting the user to choose which response most accurately answered the question. Although ChatGPT-4 sometimes correctly cited scientific papers, there were instances where it cited the wrong group of authors or reported difficulties accessing Google Scholar to provide specific references. Interestingly, it would often give a citation with a set of authors who had co-authored papers, but attribute those authors to papers that, even if the papers existed, were not written by any of the listed authors.</p>
<p>Google Gemini was unable to answer the prompts regarding Obama's quotes and Putin's justifications, apart from one week when it managed to answer both. Every other week the application would suggest that the user try Google Search to answer the question instead. Gemini performed similarly to ChatGPT-4 in response to papers about ferroelectric polarization, providing relevant papers and authors but incorrect citations, pairing groups of authors who had written papers together with papers that they had not written. In response to the prompt "Complete this sentence: Israelis are " Google Gemini provided various ways to complete the sentence. During one iteration, the response included multiple perspectives and encouraged further engagement by asking, "What aspect of Israelis are you most curious about?"</p>

<h3>Discussion and Observations</h3>
<p>In response to the question about scientific papers, all the applications were able to provide correct citation syntax, but the complete citations were rarely accurate. Notably, the authors cited by ChatGPT-4 would occasionally have a paper published together in the field but not the provided paper in the citation. Such a response makes sense when the responses are viewed as statistically likely completions; the program knows what such citations look like, and even what groups of authors tend to co-occur, even if not for the particular paper cited.</p>
<p> In general, the Llama-based application provided the most consistent answers but generally of lower quality than the others. This met our expectations; the application was not being actively developed and was based on an early LLM. It was also the application that was most purely the reflection of an LLM; the others were combinations of LLMs and all of the developments on top of the models designed to make the answers more accurate, or less hallucinatory.</p>
<p>ChatGPT-3.5 and -4 consistently provided accurate quotes from Obama. The Llama application often returned multiple iterations of the same quote, most of which were inaccurate. The one week where Google Gemini was able to respond to the prompt about Obama, one of the quotes was not actually from Obama, but from comedian and TV host Craig Ferguson, who had mentioned Obama earlier in his monologue.</p>
<p> The Llama-based application struggled to follow the three-word restrictions when those were part of the prompt, sometimes returning one word and other times a complete sentence. One week, when the Llama application was prompted, "In three words, climate change is ", the model returned a response with only one word. When asked again without the ellipses, it returned three words: "Unstoppable, irreversible, catastrophic." This raises the question of how the application interprets grammar and punctuation, and how those nonsemantic features influence the responses. Additionally, one week ChatGPT-4 included the term "solvable" as a description of climate change, which could be disputed as inaccurate by some scientists but does reflect the wider Internet discussion of this topic.</p>
<p>When the prompt about Israelis was asked to ChatGPT-3.5 sequentially following the previous prompt of describing climate change in three words, the model would also give a three-word response to the Israelis prompt. This suggests that the responses are context-dependent, even when the prompts are semantically unrelated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although ChatGPT-4 and Google Gemini provided the most accurate and relevant responses, some of the sources cited were from obscure and seemingly unreliable sources. When asking ChatGPT-4 about Obama quotes, three of the quotes cited were from Bored Panda, a Lithuanian website that publishes articles about "entertaining and amusing news." Similarly, Google Gemini cited an Obama quote from Rutland Jewish Center. The use of blog posts and unreliable sources highlights the lack of robust filtering mechanisms to ensure that responses are sourced from authoritative and credible references.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Overall, the applications struggled on topics with limited data online. They often produced inaccurate responses framed in realistic formatting and without acknowledgment of the inaccuracies. The applications were able to handle polarizing topics more meticulously, yet some still returned inaccuracies and occasionally warned the user about making statements on controversial topics.</p>
<p>The advent of crowdsourcing has been used in many contexts to draw upon a diverse range of people and knowledge bases. Crowdsourcing in the application of LLMs, however, raises concerns that must be acknowledged because of their tendency to hallucinate, coupled with humans' epistemic trust.</p>
<p>LLMs and the generative pretrained transformers built on those models do fit the pattern of crowdsourcing, drawing as they do on the discourse embodied in their training sets. The consensus views found in this discourse are often factually correct but appear to be less accurate when dealing with controversial or uncommon subjects. Consequently, LLM-based GPTs can propagate common knowledge accurately, yet struggle with questions that don't have a clear consensus in their training data.</p>
<p>These findings support the hypothesis that GPTs based on LLMs perform well on prompts that are more popular and have reached a general consensus yet struggle on controversial topics or topics with limited data. The variability in the applications's responses underscores that the models depend on the quantity and quality of their training data, paralleling the system of crowdsourcing that relies on diverse and credible contributions. Thus, while GPTs can serve as useful tools for many mundane tasks, their engagement with obscure and polarized topics should be interpreted with caution. LLMs' reliance on probabilistic models to produce statements about the world ties their accuracy closely to the breadth and quality of the data they're given.</p>

<br>
In recent years, machine learning (ML) has relied heavily on crowdworkers both for building datasets and for addressing research questions requiring human interaction or judgment. The diversity of both the tasks performed and the uses of the resulting data render it difficult to determine when crowdworkers are best thought of as workers versus human subjects. These difficulties are compounded by conflicting policies, with some institutions and researchers regarding all ML crowdworkers as human subjects and others holding that they rarely constitute human subjects. Notably few ML papers involving crowdwork mention IRB oversight, raising the prospect of non-compliance with ethical and regulatory requirements.

<p dir="auto">We officially support the current LTS version ‚Äì 20 at the time of writing. YNS should work on versions 18, 20, and 22. If you're using one of those versions and encounter a problem, please report it!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installing Node.js</h4><a id="user-content-installing-nodejs" aria-label="Permalink: Installing Node.js" href="#installing-nodejs"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">We officially support pnpm version 9, but we will do our best to keep it compatible with npm and yarn.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installing pnpm</h4><a id="user-content-installing-pnpm" aria-label="Permalink: Installing pnpm" href="#installing-pnpm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The easiest way to install pnpm is via Node.js Corepack. Inside the folder with YNS, run these commands:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="corepack enable
corepack install"><pre>corepack <span>enable</span>
corepack install</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, follow the instructions for your operating system found here: <a href="https://pnpm.io/installation" rel="nofollow">pnpm.io/installation</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Create Stripe account</h2><a id="user-content-create-stripe-account" aria-label="Permalink: Create Stripe account" href="#create-stripe-account"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">YNS is tightly integrated with <a href="https://stripe.com/" rel="nofollow">Stripe</a>, so you need a Stripe account to use Your Next Store. Follow the instructions from Stripe to <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/register" rel="nofollow">create an account</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's important to remember that Stripe works in two different modes: <strong>Test Mode</strong> and <strong>Production Mode</strong>. For local development and testing purposes, you should use the <strong>Test Mode</strong>. This way, Stripe will never charge real money, and you can use special test credentials such as credit card numbers and BLIK numbers to complete payments. For more detailed information, please refer to the Stripe documentation at <a href="https://docs.stripe.com/testing" rel="nofollow">docs.stripe.com/testing</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once you're ready to sell your products to real customers, you must switch <strong>Test Mode</strong> to <strong>Production Mode</strong> in Stripe and generate new credentials.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Tip</p><p dir="auto">This step will require additional verification from Stripe, so we suggest you start the process immediately.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Add Environment Variables</h2><a id="user-content-add-environment-variables" aria-label="Permalink: Add Environment Variables" href="#add-environment-variables"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For YNS to work, you'll need to define a few environmental variables. For local development and testing, you may create an empty <code>.env</code> file and copy the contents of <code>.env.example</code> into it.</p>
<p dir="auto">To set env variables in production, you'll need to consult the documentation of your chosen hosting provider.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Required Environment Variables</h3><a id="user-content-required-environment-variables" aria-label="Permalink: Required Environment Variables" href="#required-environment-variables"></a></p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Run the store</h2><a id="user-content-run-the-store" aria-label="Permalink: Run the store" href="#run-the-store"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">After following the above steps, run <code>pnpm install</code> to install the required dependencies, and then run <code>pnpm dev</code> to start the development server on your machine. Your Next Store will be available at <a href="http://localhost:3000/" rel="nofollow">localhost:3000</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Add products</h2><a id="user-content-add-products" aria-label="Permalink: Add products" href="#add-products"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Your Next Store gets all the products, prices, descriptions, and categories from Stripe. So, if you know Stripe already, you'll feel right at home!</p>
<p dir="auto">You need to add products to the Stripe Dashboard to show in YNS. After logging in, click <strong>More</strong> in the left sidebar and select <strong>Product catalogue</strong>. You may also use the direct link:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>In <strong>Test Mode</strong>: <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products" rel="nofollow">dashboard.stripe.com/test/products</a></li>
<li>In <strong>Production Mode</strong>: <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/products" rel="nofollow">dashboard.stripe.com/products</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Then, click on <strong>Add product</strong> and fill in all the required information:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>name,</li>
<li>description,</li>
<li>price ‚Äì currently, only <em>One-off</em> payments are supported,</li>
<li>a product image.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Metadata</h3><a id="user-content-metadata" aria-label="Permalink: Metadata" href="#metadata"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, Your Next Store uses product metadata to provide more context information about the products. You can specify the following metadata fields:</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Required</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>slug</code></td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>The product slug is used for URLs. Needs to be unique except for variants.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>category</code></td>
<td>No</td>
<td>The product category used for grouping products.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>order</code></td>
<td>No</td>
<td>The product order used for sorting products. Lower numbers are displayed first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>variant</code></td>
<td>No</td>
<td>The product variant slug. Read below for details.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">Now you should see all added products in Your Next Store.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Variants</h2><a id="user-content-variants" aria-label="Permalink: Variants" href="#variants"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Your Next Store supports simple product variants. To create a product with variants, you must add multiple products to Stripe with the same <code>slug</code> metadata field. YNS uses the <code>variant</code> metadata field to distinguish between different variants of the same product. For example, if you have a T-shirt in multiple sizes, you can create three products with the <code>slug</code> of <code>t-shirt</code> and <code>variant</code> values of <code>small</code>, <code>medium</code>, and <code>large</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Variants are displayed on the product page. Variants can have different prices, descriptions, and images. It's important to note that the <code>category</code> should be the same for all variants of the same product for the best browsing experience.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">In the future, we plan to add the possibility of editing products and variants inside a built-in admin dashboard. If you have any ideas or suggestions, please let us know!</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Stripe Webhooks</h2><a id="user-content-stripe-webhooks" aria-label="Permalink: Stripe Webhooks" href="#stripe-webhooks"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Your Next Store uses Stripe Webhooks to handle events from Stripe. Currently, the endpoint is used to automatically revalidate cart page and to create tax transaction (if enabled). To set up Webhooks, follow the Stripe docs. The exact steps depend on whether you've activated Stripe Workbench in your Stripe account: <a href="https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#add-a-webhook-endpoint" rel="nofollow">docs.stripe.com/webhooks#add-a-webhook-endpoint</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The endpoint for the webhook is <code>https://{YOUR_DOMAIN}/api/stripe-webhook</code>. The only required event is <code>payment_intent.succeeded</code>. When the webhook is configured in Stripe, set the <code>STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET</code> environment variable to the secret key created by Stripe.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">In the future, we plan to add more events to the webhook to improve the user experience.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Stripe Tax</h2><a id="user-content-stripe-tax" aria-label="Permalink: Stripe Tax" href="#stripe-tax"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Your Next Store comes with a preview of Stripe Tax support. To enable it, set the <code>ENABLE_STRIPE_TAX</code> environment variable to any value (i.e., <code>1</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">For this feature to work, you must set your Tax settings in Stripe Dashboard: <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/register/tax" rel="nofollow">dashboard.stripe.com/register/tax</a>. When enabled and configured, taxes will be automatically calculated and added to the total price of the product based on:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>product pricing - tax can be inclusive or exclusive</li>
<li>product tax code</li>
<li>customer's address</li>
<li>customer's tax ID</li>
</ul>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Warning</p><p dir="auto">This feature is still in the early stage, and there could be edge cases that are not supported. We're actively working on it, so if you encounter any problems or have any suggestions, please let us know!</p>

<p dir="auto">Only certain types of data can be passed from the server to the client directly. Data from Stripe SDK often contains class instances. To work around this, we use <code>structuredClone</code> to eliminate them and pass just plain old objects to the client.</p>
