    <p>
    Opus gets another major update with the release of version 1.5. This release brings quality improvements, including
    ML-based ones, while remaining fully compatible with RFC&nbsp;6716. Here are some of the most noteworthy upgrades.
    </p>

    <h2>Opus Gets a Serious Machine Learning Upgrade</h2>

    <p>This <a href="https://opus-codec.org/downloads/">1.5 release</a> is unlike any of the previous ones. It brings many new features
    that can improve quality and the general audio experience.
    That is achieved through machine learning. Although Opus has
    included machine learning — and even deep learning — before
    (e.g. for <a href="https://jmvalin.ca/opus/opus-1.3/">speech/music detection</a>),
    this is the first time it has used deep learning techniques to process or generate the signals
    themselves.</p>

    <p> Instead of designing a new ML-based codec
    from scratch, we prefer to improve Opus in a fully-compatible way.
    That is an important design goal for ML in Opus.
    Not only does that ensure Opus
    keeps working on older/slower devices, but it also provides an easy upgrade path. Deploying
    a new codec can be a long, painful process. Compatibility means that older and newer
    versions of Opus can coexist, while still providing the benefits of the new version
    when available.</p>

    <p>Deep learning also often gets associated with powerful GPUs, but
    in Opus, we have optimized everything such that it easily runs on most
    CPUs, including phones. We have been careful to avoid huge models (unlike LLMs with
    their hundreds of billions of parameters!). In the end, most users should not notice the extra cost,
    but people using older (5+ years) phones or microcontrollers might. For that reason, all new
    ML-based features are disabled by default in Opus 1.5. They require both a compile-time
    switch (for size reasons) and then a run-time switch (for CPU reasons).</p>

    <p>The following sections describe the new features enabled by ML.</p>

    <h2>Dealing with Packet Loss</h2>

    <p>Packet loss is one of the main annoyances one can encounter during a call. It does not
    matter how good the codec is if the packets do not get through.
    That's why most codecs have <i>packet loss concealment</i> (PLC) that can fill in for missing
    packets with plausible audio that just extrapolates what was being said and avoids leaving
    a hole in the audio (a common thing to hear with Bluetooth headsets). PLC is a place
    where ML can help a lot. Instead of using carefully hand-tuned concealment heuristics, we can just
    let a Deep Neural Network (DNN) do it. The technical details are in our
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05785.pdf">Interspeech 2022 paper</a>, for which we got the
    second place in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/audio-deep-packet-loss-concealment-challenge-interspeech-2022/results/">Audio Deep Packet Loss Concealment Challenge</a>.</p>

    <p>When building Opus, using --enable-deep-plc will compile in the deep PLC code at a cost of
    about 1 MB in binary size.
    To actually enable it at run time, you will need to set the decoder complexity to 5 or more.
    Previously, only the encoder had a complexity knob, but the decoder is now getting one too.
    It can be set with the -dec_complexity option to opus_demo, or OPUS_SET_COMPLEXITY() in the
    API (like for the encoder).
    The extra complexity from running PLC at a high loss rate is about 1% of a laptop CPU core.
    Because deep PLC only affects the decoder, turning it on does not have any compatibility
    implications.
    </p>

    <h3>Deep REDundancy (DRED)</h3>

    <p>PLC is great for filling up occasional missing packets, but unfortunately
    packets often go missing in bursts. When that happens, entire phonemes or words are lost. Of course,
    new generative models could easily be used to seamlessly fill any gap with very plausible words, but
    we believe it is good to have the listener hear the <i>same</i> words that were spoken.
    The way to achieve that is through redundancy. Opus already includes
    a low-bitrate redundancy (LBRR) mechanism to transmit every speech frame twice, but only twice.
    While this helps reduce the impact
    of loss, there's only so much it can do for long bursts.
    </p>

    <p>That is where ML can help. We were certainly not the first to think about using
    ML to make a very low bitrate speech codec. However (we think) we are the first to
    design one that is optimized solely for transmitting redundancy. A regular codec needs to
    have short packets (typically 20 ms) to keep the latency low
    and it has to limit its use of prediction specifically to avoid making the packet
    loss problem even worse. For redundancy, we don't have these problems.
    Each packet will contain a large (up to 1 second) chunk of redundant audio
    that will be transmitted all at once.
    Taking advantage of that, the Opus Deep REDundancy (DRED) uses a rate-distortion-optimized
    variational autoencoder (RDO-VAE) to efficiently compress acoustic parameters in such a way that it can
    transmit one second of redundancy with about 12-32 kb/s overhead.
    Every 20-ms packet is effectively transmitted <i>50 times</i> at a cost similar
    to the existing LBRR.
    See this <a href="https://www.amazon.science/blog/neural-encoding-enables-more-efficient-recovery-of-lost-audio-packets">
    demo</a> for a high-level overview of the science behind DRED, or read the
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04453.pdf">ICASSP 2023 paper</a> for all the details and math
    behind it.
    </p>

    <a href="https://opus-codec.org/demo/opus-1.5/dred_results.png"><img src="https://opus-codec.org/demo/opus-1.5/dred_results.png" alt="recurrent units"></a>
    <p>
    Subjective testing (MOS) results measuring the improvement provided by DRED with one second
    redundancy for a range of
    realistic packet loss conditions.
    The results show that DRED achieves much higher quality than what either neural PLC alone,
    or LBRR with neural PLC can achieve.
    When DRED is combined with LBRR, the quality approaches that of the no-loss case.
    In these tests, we used 24&nbsp;kb/s for the <em>base</em> Opus layer, 16&nbsp;kb/s extra for LBRR,
    and 32&nbsp;kb/s extra for DRED.
    </p>

    <p>Use the --enable-dred configure option (which automatically turns on --enable-deep-plc) to
    enable DRED.
    Doing so increases the binary size by about 2&nbsp;MB, with a run-time cost around 1% like for deep PLC.
    Beware that DRED is not yet standardized and the version included in Opus&nbsp;1.5 will
    not be compatible with the final version.
    That being said, it is still safe to experiment with it in applications since the bitstream
    carries an experiment version number and any version incompatibility will be detected and simply cause
    the DRED payload to be ignored (no erroneous decoding or loud noises).</p>


    <h3>Neural Vocoder</h3>

    <p>The very low complexity of deep PLC and DRED is made possible by new neural vocoder technology
    we created specifically for this project. The original papers linked above used a
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.11169.pdf">highly-optimized</a> version of the original
    <a href="https://jmvalin.ca/demo/lpcnet/">LPCNet vocoder</a>, but even that was not quite
    fast enough. So we came up with a new framewise autoregressive generative
    adversarial network (FARGAN) vocoder that uses pitch prediction to achieve
    a complexity of 600 MFLOPS: 1/5 of LPCNet. That
    allows it to run with less than 1% of a CPU core on laptops or even recent phones.
    We don't yet have a paper or writeup on FARGAN, but we are working on fixing that.</p>

    <h2>Low-Bitrate Speech Quality Enhancement</h2>

    <p>Given enough bits, most speech codecs — including Opus — are able to reach a quality
      level close to transparency.
      Unfortunately, the real world sometimes doesn't give us "enough bits". Suddenly, the coding
      artifacts can become audible, or even annoying.
      The classical approach to mitigate this problem is to apply simple, handcrafted
      postfilters that reshape the coding noise to make it less noticeable.
      While those postfilters usually provide a noticeable improvement, their effectiveness is limited. They
      can't work wonders.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rise of ML and DNNs has produced a number of new and much more powerful enhancement methods,
      but these are typically large, high in complexity, and cause additional decoder delay.
      Instead, we went for a different approach: start with the tried-and-true postfilter idea
      and sprinkle just enough DNN magic on top of it.
      Opus 1.5 includes two enhancement methods: the Linear Adaptive Coding Enhancer (LACE) and a
      Non-Linear variation (NoLACE).
      From the signal point of view, LACE is very similar to a classical postfilter.
      The difference comes from a DNN that
      optimizes the postfilter coefficients on-the-fly based on all the data available to the decoder.
      The audio itself never goes through the DNN.
      The result is a small and very-low-complexity model (by DNN standards) that can run even
      on older phones. An explanation of the internals of LACE is given in this short
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W47qh9Wp9E0">video presentation</a> and more technical
      details can be found in the corresponding <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06610">WASPAA 2023 paper</a>.
      NoLACE is an extension of LACE that requires more computation but is
      also much more powerful due to extra non-linear signal processing.
      It still runs without significant overhead on
      recent laptop and smartphone CPUs. Technical details about NoLACE are given in the corresponding
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14521">ICASSP 2024 paper</a>.
    </p>

    <a href="https://opus-codec.org/demo/opus-1.5/nolace_results.png"><img src="https://opus-codec.org/demo/opus-1.5/nolace_results.png" alt="recurrent units"></a>
    <p>
    Subjective testing (MOS) results comparing the speech decoded from the default
    decoder to the enhanced speech produced by LACE and NoLACE from that same decoder.
    The uncompressed speech has a MOS of 4.06.
    The results show that using NoLACE, Opus is now perfectly usable down to 6 kb/s.
    At 9 kb/s, NoLACE-enhanced speech is already close to transparency, and better than
    the non-enhanced 12 kb/s.
    </p>

    <p>
      To try LACE and NoLACE, just add the --enable-osce configure flag when building Opus.
      Then, to enable LACE at run-time, set the decoder complexity to 6.
      Set it to 7 or higher to enable NoLACE instead of LACE. Building with --enable-osce increases
      the binary size by about 1.6 MB, roughly 0.5 MB for LACE and 1.1 MB for NoLACE. The LACE model has a
      complexity of 100 MFLOPS which leads to a run-time cost of ~0.15% CPU usage. The NoLACE model has a complexity
      of 400 MFLOPS which corresponds to a run-time cost of ~0.75% CPU usage.
      LACE and NoLACE are currently only applied when the frame size is 20 ms (the default) and the bandwidth
      is at least wideband.
      Although LACE and NoLACE have not yet been standardized, turning them on does not have
      compatibility implications since the enhancements are independent of the encoder.
    </p>

    <h3>Samples</h3>

    <p>OK, nice graphs, but how does it actually sound? The following samples demonstrate
    the effect of LACE or NoLACE on Opus wideband speech quality at different bitrates. We recommend listening with good headphones,
    especially for higher bitrates. </p>

    <h2>WebRTC Integration</h2>

    <p>Using the deep PLC or the quality enhancements should typically require only minor
    code changes. DRED is an entirely different story. It requires closer integration with
    the jitter buffer to ensure that redundancy gets used.</p>
    <p>In a real-time communications system, the size of the jitter buffer determines the
    maximum amount of packet arrival lateness that can be tolerated without producing
    an audible gap in audio playout.
    In the case of packet loss, we can treat the DRED data similarly to
    late arriving audio packets. We take care to only insert this data into the jitter
    buffer if we have observed prior loss. In ideal circumstances, an adaptive jitter
    buffer (like NetEq used in WebRTC) will try to minimize its size in order to preserve
    interactive latency. If data arrives too late for playback, there will be an audible
    gap, but the buffer will then grow to accommodate the new nominal lateness. If network
    conditions improve the buffer can shrink back down, using time scaling to play the
    audio at a slightly faster rate. In the case of DRED, there will always be a loss vs.
    latency tradeoff. In order to make use of the DRED data and cover prior lost packets,
    we will need to tolerate a larger jitter buffer.
    But because we treat DRED similarly to late packet arrival, we can take advantage
    of the existing adaptation in NetEq to provide a reasonable compromise in loss vs. latency.
    </p>

    <p>You can try out DRED using the patches in our <a href="https://github.com/xiph/webrtc-opus-ng/tree/opus-ng">
    webrtc-opus-ng</a> fork of the Google WebRTC repository.
    Using these patches, we were able to evaluate how DRED compares to other approaches.
    And yes, it still works well even with 90% loss.
    See the results below.
    </p>

    <a href="https://opus-codec.org/demo/opus-1.5/dred_plcmos.png"><img src="https://opus-codec.org/demo/opus-1.5/dred_plcmos.png" alt="DRED PLCMOSv2 results"></a>
    <p>
    Objective evaluation of different redundancy schemes under simulated realistic
    packet loss (see <a href="#lossgen">Realistic Loss Simulator</a> below) using Microsoft's
    <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PLC-Challenge/tree/main/PLCMOS">PLCMOS v2</a> (higher is better).
    All conditions use 48 kb/s, except for DRED+LBRR which uses 64 kb/s to fully take advantage
    of both forms of redundancy.
    Results show that even under extremely lossy conditions, DRED is able to maintain
    acceptable quality.
    It may look strange that the DRED quality increases past 60% loss, but that can be explained by
    the reduced amount of switching between regular packets and DRED redundancy.
    </p>

    <h3>Samples</h3>

    <p>Of course, hearing is believing, so here are some samples produced with the WebRTC patches.
    These should be close to what one might experience during a meeting when packets start to drop.
    Notice some gaps at the beginning as the jitter buffer adapts and is then able to take full advantage
    of DRED. </p>

    <h2>IETF and Standardization</h2>

    <p>To ensure compatibility with the existing standard and future extensions of Opus,
    this work is being conducted within the newly-created IETF
    <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mlcodec/">mlcodec</a> working group.
    This effort is currently focused on three topics:
    a generic extension mechanism for Opus, deep redundancy, and speech coding enhancement.
    </p>

    <h3>Extension Format</h3>

    <p>The new DRED mechanism requires adding extra information to Opus packets while
    allowing an older decoder that does not know about DRED to still decode the regular Opus data.
    We found that the best way to achieve that was through the Opus padding mechanism.
    In the original specification, padding was added to make it possible to make a packet
    bigger if needed (e.g., to meet a constant bitrate even when the encoder produced fewer
    bits than the target).
    Thanks to padding, we can transmit extra information in a packet in a way that an
    older decoder will just not see (so it won't get confused).
    Of course, if we're going to all that trouble, we might as well make sure we're also
    able to handle any future extensions.
    Our <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mlcodec-opus-extension/">
    Opus extension Internet-Draft</a> defines a format <i>within</i> the Opus padding
    that can be used to transmit both deep redundancy, but also any future extension
    that may become useful. See our
    <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/118/materials/slides-118-mlcodec-opus-extension-mechanism-00.pdf">presentation at IETF&nbsp;118</a>
    for diagrams of how the extensions fit within an Opus packet.
    </p>

    <h3>DRED Bitstream</h3>

    <p>We are also working on standardizing DRED. Standardizing an ML algorithm is
    challenging because of the tradeoff between compatibility and extensibility.
    That's why our <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-valin-opus-dred/">
    DRED Internet-Draft</a> describes how to decode extension bits into acoustic features,
    but leaves implementers free to make both better encoders and also better
    vocoders that may further improve on the quality and/or complexity.</p>

    <h3>Enhancement</h3>
    <p>
      For enhancement, we also follow the general strategy to standardize as little as
      possible, since we also expect future research to produce better methods than we
      currently have. That's why we will specify requirements an enhancement method like
      LACE or NoLACE should satisfy in order to be allowed in an opus decoder rather than
      specifying the methods themselves.
      A corresponding <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-buethe-opus-speech-coding-enhancement/">
      enhancement Internet-Draft</a>
      has already been created for that purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>Other Improvements</h2>

    <p>Here are briefly some other changes in this release.</p>

    <h3>AVX2 Support</h3>

    <p>Opus now has support and run-time detection for AVX2.
    On machines that support AVX2/FMA (from around 2015 or newer), both the new DNN
    code and the SILK encoder will be significantly faster thanks to the use of
    256-bit SIMD.</p>

    <h3>More NEON Optimizations</h3>

    <p>Existing ARMv7 Neon optimization were re-enabled for AArch64, resulting
    in more efficient encoding.
    The new DNN code can now take advantage of the Arm <i>dot product</i> extensions
    that significantly speed up 8-bit integer dot products on a Cortex-A75 or newer
    (~5 year old phones). Support is detected at run-time, so
    these optimizations are safe on all Arm CPUs.</p>

    <a name="lossgen"></a><h3>Realistic Loss Simulator</h3>
    <p>As a side effect of trying to tune the DRED encoder to maximize quality, we realized
    we needed a better way of simulating packet loss.
    For some purposes, testing with random loss patterns (like tossing a coin repeatedly)
    can be good enough, but since DRED is specifically designed to handle bust loss (which
    is rare with independent random losses) we needed something better.
    As part of the Audio Deep Packet Loss Concealment Challenge, Microsoft
    <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PLC-Challenge">made available</a>
    some more realistic recorded packet loss traces.
    A drawback of such real data is that one cannot control the percentage of loss
    or generate sequences longer than those in the dataset.
    So we trained a generative packet loss model that can simulate realistic losses with
    a certain target overall percentage of loss.
    Packet loss traces are quite simple and our generative
    model fits in fewer than 10,000 parameters.
    To simulate loss with opus_demo, you need to build with --enable-lossgen.
    Then add -sim-loss &lt;percentage&gt; to the opus_demo command line.
    Note that the loss generator is just an initial design, so feedback is welcome.
    </p>

    <p>
    Because we believe that this loss generator can be useful to other applications,
    we have made it easy to extract it from Opus and use it in other applications.
    The main source file for the generator is <a href="https://gitlab.xiph.org/xiph/opus/-/blob/main/dnn/lossgen.c">
    dnn/lossgen.c</a>. Comments in the file contain information about the other
    dependencies needed for the loss generator.</p>

    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p>
      We hope we demonstrated how our new ML-based tools substantially
      improve error robustness and speech quality with a very modest
      performance impact and without sacrificing compatibility.
      And we're only getting started. There's still more to come.
      We encourage everyone to try out these new features for themselves.
      Please <a href="https://www.opus-codec.org/contact/">let us know</a> about your experience (good or bad)
      so we can continue to improve them.
      Enjoy!

<div id="article-body"><p>Nvidia has now banned running CUDA-based software on other hardware platforms using translation layers in its updated licensing terms. This appears to be designed to prevent both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/zluda-project-cuda-intel-gpus" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/zluda-project-cuda-intel-gpus">ZLUDA initiative</a> and, perhaps more critically, some Chinese GPU makers from utilizing CUDA code with translation layers. We've pinged Nvidia for comment and will update you with additional details or clarifications when we get a response.</p><p>

<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/never_released/status/1758946808183525702" data-url="https://twitter.com/never_released/status/1758946808183525702">Longhorn</a>, a software engineer, noticed the updated terms. "You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of the output generated using Software elements for the purpose of translating such output artifacts to target a non-Nvidia&nbsp;platform," a new clause in CUDA 11.5 reads.</p><p>

Being a leader has a good side and a bad side. On the one hand, everyone depends on you; on the other hand, everyone wants to stand on your shoulders. The latter is apparently what has happened with CUDA. Because the combination of CUDA and Nvidia hardware has proven to be incredibly efficient, tons of programs rely on it. However, as more competitive hardware enters the market, more users are inclined to run their CUDA programs on competing platforms. There are two ways to do it: recompile the code (available to developers of the respective programs) or use a translation layer.</p><p>

For obvious reasons, using a translation layer like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/zluda-project-cuda-intel-gpus" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/zluda-project-cuda-intel-gpus">ZLUDA</a> is the easiest way to run a CUDA program on non-Nvidia hardware. All one has to do is take already-compiled binaries and run them using ZLUDA or other translation layers. ZLUDA appears to be floundering now, with both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/software-allows-cuda-code-to-run-on-amd-and-intel-gpus-without-changes-zluda-is-back-but-both-companies-ditched-it-nixing-future-updates" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/software-allows-cuda-code-to-run-on-amd-and-intel-gpus-without-changes-zluda-is-back-but-both-companies-ditched-it-nixing-future-updates">AMD and Intel having passed on the opportunity to develop it further</a>, but that doesn't mean translation isn't viable.</p><p>

Several Chinese GPU makers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/chinese-gpu-developer-gets-government-funds" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/chinese-gpu-developer-gets-government-funds">including one funded by the Chinese government,</a> claim to run CUDA code. Denglin Technology designs processors featuring a "computing architecture compatible with programming models like CUDA/OpenCL." Given that reverse engineering of an Nvidia GPU is hard (unless one already somehow has all the low-level details about Nvidia GPU architectures), we are probably dealing with some sort of translation layer here, too.</p><p>

One of the largest Chinese GPU makers, Moore Threads, also has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-biggest-chinese-competitor-unveils-cutting-edge-new-ai-gpus-moore-threads-s4000-ai-gpu-and-intelligent-computing-center-server-clusters-using-1000-of-the-new-ai-gpus" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-biggest-chinese-competitor-unveils-cutting-edge-new-ai-gpus-moore-threads-s4000-ai-gpu-and-intelligent-computing-center-server-clusters-using-1000-of-the-new-ai-gpus">MUSIFY translation tool designed to allow CUDA code to work with its GPUs</a>. However, whether or not MUSIFY falls under the classification of a complete translation layer remains to be seen (some of the aspects of MUSIFY could involve porting code). As such, it isn't entirely clear if the Nvidia ban on translation layers is a direct response to these initiatives or a pre-emptive strike against future developments.</p><p>

For obvious reasons, using translation layers threatens Nvidia's hegemony in the accelerated computing space, particularly with AI applications. This is probably the impetus behind Nvidia's decision to ban running their CUDA applications on other hardware platforms using translation layers starting from CUDA 11.5.</p><p>

The clause was absent in the CUDA 11.4 release, so it looks like running applications compiled using CUDA 11.4 and earlier compilers on non-Nvidia processors using translation layers is still fine. To that end, Nvidia won't achieve its goal of preventing everyone from running software developed for its hardware on other hardware platforms using layers like ZLUDA in the short term. Longer-term, the company will certainly place legal barriers for running CUDA programs via translation layers on third-party hardware, which could have a positive effect for Nvidia and a negative one for AMD, Intel, Biren, and other developers of AI compute hardware.</p><p>

Recompiling existing CUDA programs remains perfectly legal. To simplify this, both AMD and Intel have tools to port CUDA programs to their&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amd.com/system/files/documents/porting-cuda-to-hip.pdf" data-url="https://www.amd.com/system/files/documents/porting-cuda-to-hip.pdf">ROCm</a>&nbsp;(<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/ROCm/HIPIFY" data-url="https://github.com/ROCm/HIPIFY">1</a>) and&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/migrate-cuda-applications-to-oneapi-based-on-sycl.html" data-url="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/migrate-cuda-applications-to-oneapi-based-on-sycl.html">OpenAPI</a> platforms, respectively.</p><p>

As AMD, Intel, Tenstorrent, and other companies develop better hardware, more software developers will be inclined to design for these platforms, Nvidia's CUDA dominance could ease over time. Furthermore, programs specifically developed and compiled for particular processors will inevitably work better than software run via translation layers, which means better competitive positioning for AMD, Intel, Tenstorrent, and others against Nvidia — if they can get software developers on board. GPGPU remains an important and highly competitive arena, and we'll be keeping an eye on how the situation progresses in the future.</p></div>

<p>A (directed) <dfn>graph</dfn> is a set of nodes, connected by arrows (<dfn>edges</dfn>). The nodes and edges may contain data. Here are some graphs:</p>

<p>Graphs are ubiquitous in software engineering:</p>

<ol>
<li>Package dependencies form directed graphs, as do module imports.</li>
<li>The internet is a graph of links between webpages.</li>
<li>Model checkers analyze software by exploring the “state space” of all possible configurations. Nodes are states, edges are valid transitions between states.</li>
<li>Relational databases are graphs where the nodes are records and the edges are foreign keys.</li>
<li>Graphs are a generalization of linked lists, binary trees, and hash tables.<sup id="fnref:hash-tables"><a href="#fn:hash-tables">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>Graphs are also widespread in business logic. Whitepapers with references form graphs of citations. Transportation networks are graphs of routes. Social networks are graphs of connections. If you work in software development long enough, you will end up encountering graphs <em>somewhere</em>.</p>

<p>I see graphs everywhere and use them to analyze all sorts of systems. At the same time, I dread actually using graphs in my code. There is almost no graph support in any mainstream language. None have it as a built-in type, very few have them in the standard library, and many don’t have a robust third-party library in the ecosystem. Most of the time, I have to roll graphs from scratch. There’s a gap between how often software engineers could use graphs and how little our programming ecosystems support them. Where are all the graph types?</p>

<p>As I ran into more and more graphs in my work, this question became more and more intriguing to me. So late last year I finally looked for an answer. I put a <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/if-you-work-on-a-big-language-id-like-to-talk/">call out</a> on <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/">my newsletter</a> asking for people with relevant expertise— graph algorithm inventors, language committee members, graph library maintainers— to reach out. I expected to interview a dozen people, but in the end I only needed to talk to four:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Zayenz</strong>: Former core developer of the <a href="https://www.gecode.org/">Gecode constraint solver</a>, and who has “implemented every graph algorithm there is”</li>
<li><strong>Bradford</strong>: Author of the <a href="https://github.com/praetorian-inc/noseyparker/">Nosey Parker</a> security library and inventor of several new graph algorithms</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://ntietz.com/">Nicole</a></strong>: Former graph database engineer</li>
<li><strong>Kelly</strong>: Maintainer on the <a href="https://networkx.org/">NetworkX</a> python graph library and <a href="https://github.com/boothby/repiet">compiler developer</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>After these four people all gave similar answers, I stopped interviewing and start writing.</p>

<h2 id="the-reasons">The reasons</h2>

<h3 id="there-are-too-many-design-choices">There are too many design choices</h3>

<p>So far I’ve been describing <em>directed</em> graphs. There are also <em>undirected</em> graphs, where edges don’t have a direction. Both directed and undirected graphs can either be <dfn>simple graphs</dfn>, where there is a maximum of one edge between two nodes, or <dfn>multigraphs</dfn>, where there can be many edges. And then for each of <em>those</em> types we have hypergraphs, where an edge can connect three or more nodes, and ubergraphs, where edges can point to other edges. For each possible variation you have more choices to make: do you assign ids to edges or just to nodes? What data can be stored in a node, and what can be stored in an edge? That’s a lot of decisions for a library to make!</p>

<p>But wait, do these distinctions matter at all? A simple graph is just a degenerate multigraph, and and undirected edge can be losslessly transformed into two directed edges. A language could just provide directed hyperubermultigraphs and let users restrict it however they want.</p>

<p>There are two problems with this. First of all, it changes the interface, like whether various operations return single values or lists. Second, as I’ll discuss later, graph algorithm performance is a serious consideration and the special cases <em>really matter</em>. Kelly raised the example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_weight_matching">maximum weight matching</a>. If you know that your graph is “bipartite”, you can use a particular fast algorithm to find a matching, while for other graphs you need to use a slow, more general algorithm.</p>

</center>


<blockquote>
<p>[It] ties back to the “algorithm dispatch problem.”  Given a Problem P, a Graph G, and Algorithms A, B, C to solve P on G… which one do you run?  If we don’t know that G is bipartite, and Algorithm C only works on bipartite graphs, how much time can we afford to determine whether or not G is bipartite? — <em>Kelly</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The perfect graph library would support a lot of different kinds of graphs. But that takes time away from supporting what people want to <em>do</em> with graphs. Graph algorithms are notoriously hard to get right. In <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs/">this essay</a>, the inventor of Python implemented his own <code>find_shortest_path</code> algorithm. It had to be updated with corrections five times!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every single implementation of pagerank that I compared to was wrong. — <em>Nicole</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So which algorithms should come with the library? “The amount of things people want to do with graphs is absurd,” Kelly told me. That matches my experience, and the experiences of all my interviewees. It sometimes seems like graphs are <em>too powerful</em>, that all their possibilities are beyond my understanding. “The question is,” Kelly said, “where do you draw the line?”</p>

<p>For NetworkX, “the line” is approximately 500 distinct graph algorithms, by themselves making up almost 60,000 lines of code. By comparison, the entire Python standard library, composed of 300 packages, is just under 600,000 lines.<sup id="fnref:derivation"><a href="#fn:derivation">2</a></sup></p>

<p>With all that, it’s unsurprising that you don’t see graphs in standard libraries. The language maintainers would have to decide which types of graphs to support, what topologies to special-case, and what algorithms to include. It makes sense to push this maintenance work onto third parties. This is already the mainstream trend in language development; even Python, famous for being “batteries included”, is <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/">removing 20 batteries</a>.</p>

<p>Third parties can make opinionated decisions on how to design graphs and what algorithms to include. But then they’re faced with the next problem: once you have a graph interface, how do you represent it?</p>

<h3 id="there-are-too-many-implementation-choices">There are too many implementation choices</h3>

<p>Let’s imagine we’re supporting only barebones simple directed graphs: nodes have identities, edges do not, neither has any associated data. How do we encode this graph?</p>

<center>
<figure> 
  <img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/graph-types/img/many-encodings.gv.png" title="A graph diagram of `a -> b -> c -> {a, b}`">

  <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/graph-types/img/many-encodings.gv">(source)</a>

<p>Here are four possible ways a programming language could internally store it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Edge list: <code>[[a, b], [b, c], [c, a], [c, b]]</code></li>
<li>Adjacency list: <code>[[b], [c], [a, b]]</code></li>
<li>Adjacency matrix: <code>[0 1 0; 0 0 1; 1 1 0]</code></li>
<li>A set of three structs with references to each other</li>
</ol>

<p>Different graph operations have different performance characteristics on different representations. Take a directed graph with 100 nodes and 200 edges. If we use an adjacency matrix representation, we need a 100×100 matrix containing 200 ones and 9,800 zeros.  If we instead use an edge list we need only 200 pairs of nodes. Depending on your PL and level of optimizations that could be a memory difference of 20x or more.</p>

<p>Now instead take a graph with 100 nodes and 8,000 edges and try to find whether an edge exists between node 0 and node 93. In the matrix representation, that’s an O(1) lookup on <code>graph[0][93]</code>. In the edge list representation, that’s an O(|edge|) iteration through all 8,000 edges.<sup id="fnref:variations"><a href="#fn:variations">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Graphs with only a few edges are <dfn>sparse</dfn> and graphs with almost all edges are <dfn>dense</dfn>. The same program may need to do both operations on both kinds of graph topologies: if you’re constructing a graph from external data, you could start out with a sparse graph and later have a dense one. There’s no “good option” for the internal graph representation.</p>

<p>And all this trouble is just for the most barebones directed graph! What about implementing node data? Edge data? Different types of nodes and edges? Most third party libraries roughly fall in one of two categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Offer a single rich datatype that covers all use-cases at the cost of efficiency. NetworkX stores graph as a dict of dicts of dicts, so that both nodes and edges can have arbitrary data.<sup id="fnref:networkx-representations"><a href="#fn:networkx-representations">4</a></sup></p></li>

<li><p>Offer separate graph types for each representation, and rely on the user to store node and edge data separately from the graph type.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>An example of the second case would be <a href="https://docs.rs/petgraph/latest/petgraph/index.html">Petgraph</a>, the most popular graph library for Rust. Petgraph has <code>graph</code>, <code>graphmap</code>, and <code>matrix_graph</code> for different use-cases. Bradford used Petgraph for <a href="https://github.com/praetorian-inc/noseyparker/">Nosey Parker</a>, a security tool that scans for secrets across an entire history of a git repo. His benchmarking graph is CPython, which has 250k commits and 1.3M objects but only a few edges per commit node. He went with an adjacency list.</p>

<p>Supporting many representations has a serious downside: you have to do a lot more work to add algorithms. If you write a separate version of the algorithm for each graph representation, you’re tripling or quadrupling the maintenance burden. If you instead write a generic abstraction over polymorphic types, then your library is less performant. One programmer I talked to estimated that a hand-rolled graph algorithm can be 20x faster or more than a generic algorithm.</p>

<p>And this gets into every interviewee’s major complaint.</p>

<h3 id="performance-is-too-important">Performance is too important</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>A “generic” graph implementation often doesn’t cut it. <em>— Bradford</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the big one.</p>

<p>Many, many graph algorithms are NP-complete or harder.<sup id="fnref:np"><a href="#fn:np">5</a></sup> While NP-complete is often tractable <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/np-hard/">for large problems</a>, graphs can be <em>enormous</em> problems. The choice of representation plays a big role in how fast you can complete it, as do the specifics of your algorithm implementation.</p>

<p>Everyone I talked to had stories about this. In Nosey Parker, Bradford needed to reconstruct a snapshot of the filesystem for each commit, which meant traversing the object graph. None of the <a href="https://docs.rs/petgraph/latest/petgraph/visit/index.html">four provided graph walkers</a> scaled to his use case. Instead he had to design a “semi-novel” <a href="https://github.com/praetorian-inc/noseyparker/blob/aaacceaa4baf0fb6a9c98c95b9b063ed74654349/crates/input-enumerator/src/git_metadata_graph.rs#L337">graph traversal algorithm</a> on the fly, which reduced the memory footprint by a factor of a thousand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was able to get working a proof of concept pretty quickly with [petgraph], but then… this is one of those cases where the performance constraints end up meeting reality. <em>— Bradford</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zayenz raised a different problem: what if the graph is simply too big to work with? He gave the example of finding a solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_Puzzle">15 puzzle</a>. This is done by running a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* search</a> on the state space. A state space with <a href="https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1283911/60434.pdf">over 20 trillion states</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you generate all the nodes, you’ve lost already. — <em>Zayenz</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zayenz oversaw one research project to add graphs to the Gecode constraint solver. They eventually found that a generic graph type simply couldn’t compete with handpicking the representation for the problem.</p>

<p>Even graph databases, designed entirely around running complex graph algorithms, struggle with this problem. Nicole, the graph database engineer, told me about some of the challenges with optimizing even basic graph operations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you’re doing a traversal, you either have to limit your depth or accept you’re going to visit the entire graph. When you do a depth search, like “go out three steps from this and find the path if it exists”, then you’re just committing to visiting quite a bit of data. <em>— Nicole</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After leaving that job, she worked as a graph query performance consultant. This usually meant migrating off the graph database. She told me about one such project: to speed the graph queries up, she left one computation as-is and rewrote the rest as MapReduce procedures. “Which was a lot harder to understand,” she said, “But would actually finish overnight.”</p>

<p>All of this means that if you have graph problems you want to solve, you need a lot of control over the specifics of your data representation and algorithm. You simply cannot afford to leave performance on the table.</p>

<h2 id="it-was-unanimous">It was unanimous</h2>

<p>So, the reasons we don’t have widespread graph support:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are many different kinds of graphs</li>
<li>There are many different representations of each kind of graph</li>
<li>There are many different graph algorithms</li>
<li>Graph algorithm performance is very sensitive to graph representation and implementation details</li>
<li>People run very expensive algorithms on very big graphs.</li>
</ul>

<p>This explains why languages don’t support graphs in their standard libraries: too many design decisions, too many tradeoffs, and too much maintenance burden. It explains why programmers might avoid third party graph libraries, because they’re either too limited or too slow. And it explains why programmers might not want to think about things in terms of graphs except in extreme circumstances: it’s just too hard to work with them.</p>

<p>Since starting this research, I’ve run into several new graph problems in my job. I still appreciate analyzing systems as graphs and dread implementing them. But now I know why everybody else dreads them, too. Thank you for reading!</p>

<h2 id="appendix-languages-with-graph-types">Appendix: Languages with Graph Types</h2>

<h3 id="graph-querying-languages">Graph Querying Languages</h3>

<p>Graph querying languages (GQLs)<sup id="fnref:GQL"><a href="#fn:GQL">6</a></sup> are to graph databases what SQL is to relational databases. There is no widely-used standard, but two of the most popular are <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/">SPARQL</a> for querying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF triples</a> and Neo4j’s <a href="https://neo4j.com/product/cypher-graph-query-language/">cypher</a>. Ironically, <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is <a href="https://graphql.org/faq/#is-graphql-a-database-language-like-sql"><em>not</em></a> a graph querying language, instead being named for its connection to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Graph_Search">Facebook Graph Search</a>. I considered graph databases themselves mostly distinct from graphs in programming languages, but their query languages show how graphs could work in a PL.</p>

<p>The main difference between all GQLs and SQL is that the “joins” (relationships) are first-class entities. Imagine a dataset of movies and people, where people act in, direct, or produce movies. In SQL you’d implement each relationship as a many-to-many tables, which makes it easy to query “who acted in movie X” but hard to query “who had any role in movie Y, and what was that role”. In SPARQL relationships are just edges, making the same query easy.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sparql"><span></span><span>PREFIX</span> <span>mv:</span> <span>&lt;your_movie_ontology_URL&gt;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>?person</span> <span>?role</span>
<span>WHERE</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>?person</span> <span>?role</span> <span>mv:</span><span>casablanca</span><span>.</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Cypher has a similar construct. GQLs can also manipulate edges: reverse them, compose them together, take the transitive closure, etc. If we wanted to find all actors with some degree of separation from Kevin Bacon, we could write</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sparql"><span></span><span>PREFIX</span> <span>mv:</span> <span>&lt;your_movie_ontology_URL&gt;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>?a</span>
<span>WHERE</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>mv:</span><span>kbacon</span> <span>(:</span><span>acted_in/</span><span>^:</span><span>acted_in</span><span>)</span><span>+</span> <span>?a.</span>
    <span># a/b = join two lookups</span>
    <span># ^a = reverse a</span>
    <span># a+ = transitive closure</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>SPARQL cannot give the length of the path nor do computation <em>along</em> the path, like collecting the chain of movies linking two actors. GQLs that support this are significantly more complicated.</p>

<p>My main takeaway from looking at GQLs is that there’s a set of useful traversal primitives that a PL with graph support would need to provide. Interestingly, the formal specification language <a href="https://alloytools.org/">Alloy</a> has all of these primitives for its “relation” datatype. For this reason I find working with a graph representation in Alloy much easier than in a proper programming language. That said, these all work with labeled edges and may not work for other graph representations.</p>

<h3 id="mainstream-languages-with-graphs-in-the-standard-library">Mainstream Languages with Graphs in the Standard Library</h3>

<p><strong>Python</strong> added a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/graphlib.html">graphlib</a> in 2020. Based on the discussion <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue17005">here</a>, it was because topological sorting is a “fundamental algorithm” and it would be useful for “pure Python implementations of MRO [Method Resolution Order] logic”. Graphlib has no other methods besides <code>TopologicalSorter</code>, which only takes graphs represented as node dicts. Unusually, the direction of the node dict is <em>reversed</em>: the graph <code>a -&gt; b</code> is represented as <code>{b: [a]}</code>.</p>

<p>As of 2023, nothing in <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Apython%2Fcpython%20TopologicalSorter&amp;type=code">CPython uses graphlib</a> and there are <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%2F%28from%7Cimport%29+graphlib%2F+language%3Apython+NOT+is%3Afork&amp;type=code">fewer than 900 files referencing it on Github</a>. By comparison, another package added in 2020, zoneinfo, appears in over 6,000 files, and the term <code>def topological_sort(</code> appears in 4,000. I’d guess a lot of these are from before 2020, though. Some skimming suggests that all of these custom topological sorts take different graph representations than graphlib, so they wouldn’t be convertable regardless. Graph representation matters.</p>

<p>There are two other languages I found with graph types: <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/digraph.html#">Erlang</a> and <a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=ugraphs">SWI-Prolog</a>. I don’t know either language and cannot tell when they were added; with Erlang, at least, it was before 2008. I reached out to a person on the Erlang core language committee but did not hear back.</p>

<h3 id="graph-languages">Graph languages</h3>

<p>Programming languages where “everything is a graph” in the same way that everything in bash a string and everything in lisp is a list. Some examples include <a href="https://github.com/UoYCS-plasma/GP2">GP2</a> and <a href="http://jenshweber.github.io/grape/">Grape</a>. Based on some correspondence with people in the field, right now this is still highly academic.</p>

<h3 id="mathematics-software-languages">Mathematics Software Languages</h3>

<p>Mathematica, MATLAB, Maple, etc all have graph libraries of some form or another. I am not paying the thousands of dollars in licensing needed to learn more.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        
<p id="p2">It all started because I wanted a better keyboard for my Vision Pro. I had no idea that, in looking for one, I’d accidentally create the hybrid Apple computer of my dreams.</p>
<p id="p3">As I quickly discovered after working on the Vision Pro daily, you can get by without an external trackpad, but a keyboard is necessary if you want to type something longer than a passcode. That’s where my journey began: if I wanted to write and edit articles on the Vision Pro, what would the best keyboard-trackpad setup be?</p>
<p id="p4">Over the past few weeks, I’ve tested all the options at my disposal. I started with an Apple Magic Trackpad and Keyboard, which I then placed inside a <a href="https://amzn.to/49S9jJw" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twelve South MagicBridge</a> (it was too uncomfortable to put on my lap for longer stretches of time). Next, I tried using <a href="https://amzn.to/3STG9mM" rel="noopener noreferrer">different</a> <a href="https://amzn.to/3TgPTbO" rel="noopener noreferrer">types</a> of “trays” for these two accessories that offered a laptop-like layout (comfort was better, but lack of palm rejection was an issue). I even attempted to revive an <a href="https://amzn.to/3SXlr5j" rel="noopener noreferrer">old Brydge keyboard</a> and use it with the Vision Pro, but, alas, third-party trackpads aren’t supported on visionOS at the moment.</p>
<p id="p5">Eventually, I settled on the solution that I should have known was coming for me all along: the best keyboard and trackpad combo for a Vision Pro is a Mac laptop. So I started using my MacBook Air every day, taking advantage of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213971" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mac Virtual Display</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102459" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Control</a> to get work done with the Vision Pro in a mix of classic desktop apps and new visionOS experiences. I’ll write more about this soon, but, so far, it’s felt powerful and flexible in a way that iPadOS hasn’t made me feel in a while.</p>
<p id="p6">But something kept nagging me.</p>

<p id="p9">Why wasn’t <em>Apple</em> making that kind of combined accessory for the Vision Pro? More importantly for my use case: I had a screen physically attached to my MacBook Air, but I rarely looked at it. If I’m using my MacBook Air with Mac Virtual Display or, when I’m at my desk, in clamshell mode with my Studio Display, do I even need a screen to be permanently attached to a computer that I primarily use as a keyboard and trackpad for other displays?</p>
<p id="p10">Just as I was pondering these thoughts, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/can-you-use-a-headless-macbook-air-with-a-vision-pro/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke Miani’s video appeared</a> like a sign from the universe. The concept behind the video was fascinating: if a Vision Pro can provide you with a virtual display for your Mac, can you physically remove the display from a MacBook and continue using it in “headless” mode with a Vision Pro or other external monitors? The answer is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUa_pPUbpGQ" rel="noopener noreferrer">yes</a>.</p>
<p id="p11">That video planted an idea in my brain that I couldn’t get rid of. I could see myself working with that type of accessory; removing the screen from my MacBook Air would make it even lighter to carry around and put on my lap; it would also mean I could get rid of the standalone Magic Keyboard and Trackpad on my desk and just use the remaining part of the MacBook Air for input with my Studio Display.</p>
<p id="p12">I was tempted, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized there was an obvious missing piece. What about those times when you do want to have a screen attached to your MacBook Air because you can’t or don’t want to wear a Vision Pro?</p>
<p id="p13">And <em>that</em> was the turning point, and why I needed you to follow along with this introduction, so you can understand – I hope – how my brain operates.</p>
<p id="p14">You see, I’d been thinking about creating a headless MacBook Air and relying on Universal Control, but I was only considering one side of the story – the Mac-to-Vision Pro side. It was only when I remembered that Mac-to-iPad Universal Control and Sidecar also existed that everything clicked:</p>
<p id="p15">I didn’t just want to make a headless MacBook anymore. I had to figure out how to combine the MacBook Air and iPad Pro into a single machine.</p>
<p id="p16">For the past three weeks, I’ve been using something I call a “MacPad” as my new laptop. The MacPad is a hybrid device that serves multiple purposes:</p>
<ul id="ul17"><li>It’s a keyboard and trackpad for my Vision Pro;</li>
<li>It’s a Mac with a detachable display;</li>
<li>It’s an iPad Pro with an external keyboard and trackpad.</li>
</ul><p id="p18">You know where this is going. These aren’t three separate devices: it’s <strong>one</strong> computer made of, well, <strong>two</strong> computers working together thanks to the magic of Apple’s ecosystem. It’s a Mac with an iPad display that I can detach and use as a tablet whenever I want; it’s an iPad that transforms into a Mac when docked. And, it’s the ideal keyboard and trackpad accessory for the Vision Pro.</p>
<p id="p19">In researching keyboard options for the Vision Pro, I ended up building the convertible Apple laptop-tablet that I so desperately want the company to make.</p>
<p id="p20">Let me explain how.</p>

<p id="p25">Alright, so obviously the first step of the process is to physically remove the screen from a MacBook, right? Well, not quite. Let me share some advice first.</p>
<p id="p26">As I was considering this procedure for my own MacBook Air, I started wondering what would happen if my headless Mac shut down or had to reboot and I didn’t have a monitor to see the login screen and type my password. <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/use-ipad-as-a-second-display-for-mac-ipad2b1aa3be/ipados" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sidecar</a>, which is the Apple software that turns an iPad into a Mac display, can only be activated from an unlocked Mac; <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102442" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Watch unlock</a> for macOS only works after you’ve logged in with a password at least once after a macOS restart.</p>
<p id="p27">This may be a dealbreaker to some, but to overcome this issue, I created a stronger password for my Mac and disabled <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/protect-data-on-your-mac-with-filevault-mh11785/mac" rel="noopener noreferrer">FileVault encryption</a> so that I could use <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/remote-desktop/set-up-a-computer-running-vnc-software-apdbed09830/mac" rel="noopener noreferrer">VNC</a> access at the macOS login screen, even after a reboot.<sup id="fnref-74584-loginScreen"><a href="#fn-74584-loginScreen" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a></sup></p>
<p id="p28">I disabled FileVault in System Settings ⇾ Privacy &amp; Security ⇾ FileVault, made sure that screen sharing was enabled under System Settings ⇾ General ⇾ Sharing, and shut down my MacBook Air before removing the display, as a test.</p>


<p id="p31">I then powered on the MacBook Air again, selected the computer I previously configured in <a href="https://edovia.com/en/screens/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edovia’s Screens VNC client</a> and the app successfully showed me the macOS login screen even after my Mac had just rebooted:</p>

<p id="p33">That was the first issue I wanted to figure out upfront, and my theory worked. As long as you have FileVault disabled and both a headless Mac and VNC client (which, in my case, is running on an iPad) are connected to the same network, screen sharing is going to work at the login screen to type in your password. For subsequent unlocks, of course, you can rely on Touch ID, Apple Watch unlock, or <a href="https://www.macstories.net/shortcuts/#wake-mac-login" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Shortcuts app with SSH scripts</a>, as we’ll see below.<sup id="fnref-74584-captureCard"><a href="#fn-74584-captureCard" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a></sup></p>
<p id="p34">Next, you may have heard that to use Sidecar as an external monitor for a headless Mac, you also have to buy a “dummy” HDMI adapter to make macOS believe it still has a main display connected to it. This is only partially true. If you want to use Sidecar with a headless Mac mini that is not connected to an actual monitor, then yes: you have to buy a dummy HDMI plug. But with the method I followed to remove the display from my MacBook Air, it’s not necessary: macOS will continue to think there is a built-in display attached to the computer, even after it’s been physically disconnected from the display connector inside the chassis. If you plan on doing this with a Mac laptop, you won’t need an extra video-out adapter.</p>


<p id="p37">And now for the main event: to make my 13-inch M2 MacBook Air a headless computer, I followed – word for word – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUa_pPUbpGQ" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke Miani’s walkthrough on YouTube</a>, which you can watch below:</p>
<p><span><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QUa_pPUbpGQ?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p id="p39">My advice: before you do this, watch the video twice and make a note of all the equipment you’re going to need. I recommend the <a href="https://amzn.to/4bQgAeN" rel="noopener noreferrer">iFixit toolkit</a> and a separate <a href="https://amzn.to/3UXskpV" rel="noopener noreferrer">set of Torx screwdrivers</a> with all the sizes mentioned in the video. It’s not a hard procedure, but you’ll have to be careful, particularly when removing the shield from the battery connector and unplugging it. If you’re brave enough to do this, make sure you’re working on a clean surface where you can keep track of all the shields and screws you’re removing from the computer; don’t rush the job and watch every step multiple times, even if you think you know what you’re doing.</p>


<p id="p42">Once I successfully removed the display, I then put back some of the shields that were covering all the connectors and hinges inside the Air’s chassis, but – like Miani – I eventually ran out of patience and sealed everything again without re-applying all the shields. (It’s been fine so far.)</p>

<p id="p44">It was finally the moment of truth: I had to turn on my Mac, wait a few seconds, and see if I could log in the first time using VNC on my iPad. I have to be honest: it was a very stressful 30 seconds after I pressed the power button and the Air’s trackpad wasn’t clicking. But then the keyboard lit up, the Air showed up in the list of nearby devices in Screens, and I knew I’d done it:</p>

<p id="p46">I was “remotely” logged into my headless MacBook Air from my iPad, but, of course, using it as an actual display meant I had to set up Sidecar. And not only that, but I also had to find out if I could <strong>initiate a Sidecar connection from the iPad itself</strong> rather than do it from macOS every time.</p>
<p id="p47">I’ll get to that in a minute. First, I had to create an adjustable display mount for my new iPad display.</p>
<h2 id="attaching-the-ipad-pro-to-the-macbook-air">Attaching the iPad Pro to the MacBook Air</h2>
<p id="p48">If I wanted the hybrid laptop-tablet of my dreams that Apple won’t make, I’d need a system to tear my MacBook’s display away, so I could use it as a tablet. That’s the computer I want Apple to make; for now, I’d have to create my own version by relying on some old friends:</p>
<p id="p49">Magnets.</p>
<p id="p51">The idea came naturally as soon as I pictured the iPad Pro as a Sidecar display floating above the MacBook Air’s keyboard: to mimic a laptop configuration, I could rely on adjustable magnetic mounts to provide a sturdy, yet flexible mounting option for the iPad Pro. Even better, if I used enough magnets and positioned them just right, I could even support a wider viewing angle than the MacBook Air typically allows for.</p>
<p id="p52">Once again, I used the <a href="https://amzn.to/3SUCepI" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Square Edge Pro Core</a> mounts, which you may remember from my story about <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ipad/how-i-modded-my-ipad-pro-with-a-screen-protector-iphone-holder-and-magnetic-stereo-speakers/" rel="noopener noreferrer">attaching an iPhone and puck-style speakers</a> to my iPad Pro. First, I attached three adhesive magnetic bases to the bottom of my MacBook Air, like so:</p>

<p id="p54">As you can see, I attached the bases as close to the chassis’ edge as I could. I did that so that the adjustable mounting clips could extend as far as possible both toward the Air’s keyboard <em>and</em> away from it. By doing this, thanks to the Edge Pro Core’s widely adjustable angle, I can even lay the display flat on a table if I want to:</p>



<p id="p58">Then came my next idea: crafting a custom magnetic cover for the iPad Pro that would also attach to the Rolling Square magnets on the MacBook Air.</p>
<p id="p59">While I stuck three magnetic bases to the bottom of the MacBook Air – which is something I never see or touch – I didn’t want to attach three magnets to the back of my iPad Pro. Here’s what I did instead: I took an <a href="https://amzn.to/3UWHonx" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESR smart cover for the iPad Pro</a> (a cheaper alternative to Apple’s Smart Folio that I’ve been using for years now) and used a knife to separate the back cover from the front. I also cut out the Apple Pencil flap since I wasn’t going to use it. Then, I lined up three magnets with the Rolling Square clips, attached them to the smart cover, and <em>voila</em>: I created a lightweight mounting system that would allow me to easily and quickly tear away the MacBook’s display and use it as an iPad.</p>


<p id="p62">When I say “tear away the display”, I mean it. Here’s how simple it is to go from MacBook mode to iPad mode when I’m done working with macOS:</p>

<p id="p64">I can also choose to detach the iPad <em>without</em> its cover:</p>

<p id="p66">I’ve been working with this magnetic attachment system for the past couple of weeks, and it’s been terrific. The more adjustable viewing angles have allowed me to use this computer while lying on the couch or in bed and tilt the display back further than a typical MacBook Air. Three magnets provide a connection strong enough to walk around the house with this computer without the fear of the iPad detaching from the Air’s chassis. The final product, as I’ll explain later, is heavier than a MacBook Air – but it also carries the benefits of two OSes in the same machine.</p>
<p id="p67">Is there a more elegant and practical solution that doesn’t involve sticking magnets to a MacBook Air or cutting a smart cover by hand? I’m sure there is. Perhaps someone with a 3D printer and more skills than yours truly could design a custom mounting system that integrates nicely with the Air’s display hinges and chassis. However, given my lack of expertise and resources, I think the modular system I designed is pretty good, and it does the job well.</p>
<h2 id="using-sidecar-to-turn-an-ipad-into-a-mac-display">Using Sidecar to Turn an iPad into a Mac Display</h2>
<p id="p68">Enough about hardware. It’s time to get to the meaty part of this story: Sidecar.</p>
<p id="p69">We’ve been able to use an iPad as an extended display for macOS for the past five years – since macOS Catalina and iPadOS 13, to be exact. Sidecar has barely changed over the years, so what <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/sidecar-in-ios-13-and-macos-catalina-working-seamlessly-between-an-ipad-and-mac/" rel="noopener noreferrer">John covered in his original story</a> still applies today: Sidecar was conceived to use an iPad as a secondary display for a Mac; you can drag windows from the Mac’s main display to the iPad’s, or you can send individual windows from one monitor to another. There are some additional options you can configure (there’s even a virtual Touch Bar, still!), which you can also read about in Apple’s support document <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102597" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p id="p70">There’s only one problem, though: even after five years, you can only initiate a Sidecar connection from a Mac first. Suffice to say, that was a bit of a problem for someone who no longer had a display attached to his MacBook Air. How could I interact with the macOS UI to start Sidecar without a display? Was my only solution to VNC into my Mac first and then manually start Sidecar from there every time?</p>
<p id="p71">See, my dream was more ambitious. I wanted to sit down with my MacPad, press a button on iPadOS, and enter macOS mode; then once I was done, I wanted to be able to press another button on the Mac, and return to iPadOS mode. Essentially, I wanted <strong>a seamless transition between macOS and iPadOS</strong>, designed around Sidecar but faster than what Apple normally allows for.</p>
<p id="p72">And, dear readers, I figured it out.</p>
<p id="p73">During my research, I came across a lot of Reddit and forum threads from people who were wondering if there was a way to use Shortcuts and automation to start a Sidecar connection directly from iPadOS. I tried some of the methods mentioned online, including one that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/fzjlil/initiate_sidecar_from_ipad/" rel="noopener noreferrer">involved</a> the often-unreliable GUI automation, and none of them worked as quickly or reliably as I hoped. Then I came across <a href="https://github.com/Ocasio-J/SidecarLauncher" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sidecar Launcher</a>, an open-source project by developer Jovany Ocasio that provided exactly the solution I was looking for.</p>
<p id="p74">Unlike other tools to start a Sidecar connection you may find on the Internet, Sidecar Launcher is not based on AppleScript. Instead, Sidecar Launcher is a little executable program that uses private APIs based on Apple’s ‘SidecarCore’ framework to return a list of all available Sidecar-enabled devices, start a specific Sidecar connection without interacting with macOS at all, or disconnect Sidecar. You can inspect the Sidecar Launcher code <a href="https://github.com/Ocasio-J/SidecarLauncher/blob/main/SidecarLauncher/main.swift" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and, if you want, download the Xcode project and build the executable file yourself.</p>
<p id="p75">To use Sidecar Launcher, you just need to download the executable script, place it somewhere in Finder, and then download a companion shortcut on your iPad. The shortcut created by Jovany Ocasio requires you to enter your Mac’s IP address/hostname, username, and password, as well as the path where you placed the Sidecar Launcher script. That’s all the configuration you need to do and you won’t have to touch Sidecar Launcher at all in the future.<sup id="fnref-74584-someTips"><a href="#fn-74584-someTips" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a></sup> When you run the shortcut on your iPad, it’ll take care of waking up your Mac, logging in, and enabling the Sidecar connection for you. Run the shortcut on your iPad, wait 10 seconds or so, and the iPad’s screen will turn into a macOS extended display – no further interaction necessary.</p>

<p id="p77">The first time I tried Sidecar Launcher, I knew it was precisely what I needed, but I still wanted to make it faster and easier to use. Take a look at how Jovany Ocasio’s shortcut works by default:</p>

<p id="p79">And here’s <strong>Sidecar Launcher (Ticci’s Version)</strong>, which connects to macOS and enables Sidecar in two seconds:</p>

<p id="p81">I modified the original Sidecar Launcher shortcut in a couple of ways. For starters, I privately got in touch with Jovany Ocasio, who was kind enough to listen to my feedback and implemented a <code>disconnect</code> command that terminates an existing Sidecar session. That allowed me to put together a version of a shortcut that acts as a toggle:</p>
<ul id="ul82"><li>When run from the iPad, the shortcut instantly connects to the Mac;</li>
<li>When run from the Mac, the same shortcut disconnects Sidecar.</li>
</ul><p id="p83">In my version of the shortcut, I removed all the code that dealt with waking a Mac and authenticating the user: I can just unlock my headless MacBook Air with Touch ID and know that the computer is ready to go when I run the shortcut in my iPad’s dock.<sup id="fnref-74584-miniHeadless"><a href="#fn-74584-miniHeadless" rel="noopener noreferrer">4</a></sup> Furthermore, I removed the need to manually choose an iPad from a list of supported Sidecar devices nearby and instead used a ‘Text’ action that gives macOS the name of the iPad it needs to connect to.</p>

<p id="p85">Thanks to these changes, as long as both the Mac and iPad are already unlocked, nearby, and on the same Wi-Fi network, the Sidecar Launcher shortcut in the iPad dock will initiate a Sidecar connection immediately. When I’m done working with macOS, running the same shortcut from the Mac’s menu bar will quit Sidecar instead. Props to Jovany Ocasio for reverse-engineering how Sidecar works and finding the private APIs that make these direct connections possible. You can download <strong>Sidecar Launcher (Ticci’s Version)</strong> below and find it in the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/shortcuts/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MacStories Shortcuts Archive</a>:</p>

<p id="p87">As we saw previously, macOS still thinks there’s a built-in display attached to my computer. And since Sidecar can turn an iPad into an extended display, it’s also possible to make it the main display of the computer – which is a setting that will stick over time, thus defaulting to the Sidecar-enabled iPad as the MacBook’s main display the next time you connect. To do this, you just need to visit System Settings ⇾ Displays, drag the menu bar onto the iPad display, and choose to make it the main one.</p>


<hr id="hr90"><p id="p91">With those setup-related details out of the way, allow me to dig into how I’ve been working with my MacPad for the past three weeks.</p>
<p id="p92">When I want to get some work done (such as editing an entire issue of the <a href="https://club.macstories.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer">newsletter</a>, long writing sessions, or recording <a href="https://appstories.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcasts</a>), I attach my 11” iPad Pro to the MacBook Air, press a button, and I’m in macOS mode thanks to Sidecar. In my experience, Sidecar has proven to be remarkably fast, reliable, and lag- or artifact-free when both the iPad Pro and MacBook Air are on a 5&nbsp;GHz W-Fi network.<sup id="fnref-74584-6Ghz"><a href="#fn-74584-6Ghz" rel="noopener noreferrer">5</a></sup> It’s truly impressive just how <em>good</em> Sidecar is when used as a wireless display and how much better it looks than, say, any VNC client that has to deal with video compression. Thanks to Sidecar, my iPad Pro feels like a native display attached to the MacBook Air – not like a different computer that’s wirelessly connected to the Mac.</p>
<p id="p94">Sidecar never breaks the illusion that you’re working with macOS and, for this reason, writing about how Sidecar works would be like writing about the entire Mac operating system. When I connect to Sidecar, my iPad simply becomes a Mac display, capable of doing all the things any regular Mac can. If there ever was a perfect fit for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmPq00jelpc" rel="noopener noreferrer">“It just works” mantra</a>, Sidecar is it.</p>
<p id="p95">That said, there are a couple of details I want to point out about working with macOS using Sidecar.</p>
<p id="p96">I tried setting up Sidecar in portrait mode using <a href="https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay" rel="noopener noreferrer">BetterDisplay</a> with my 11” iPad Pro, and it was a bad idea. At the default resolution scaling option provided by Sidecar, everything displayed on-screen was too tiny to be comfortable; plus, the portrait orientation was just weird to me. I know some folks out there like their vertical monitors for coding and other tasks, but it wasn’t for me. If you want to try, you can <a href="https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay/wiki/Rotated-Sidecar" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow this guide</a>.</p>
<p id="p97">When you’re using Sidecar, some touch input options are still available on the iPad’s display. You can swipe from the edge of the display to invoke Slide Over apps (a <em>lot</em> more on this in the next section) and swipe up with four fingers to enter the iPadOS app switcher, where you’ll notice that Sidecar is shown as a special ‘Continuity’ app that cannot be seen anywhere else in the system:</p>

<p id="p99">You can also scroll any macOS window with two fingers, pinch to zoom, or use the Apple Pencil to click any UI element. This is where we enter the wild hybrid territory of this project that I <em>love</em>, and which I will expand upon in the next section of the story.</p>
<p id="p100">At any point when I’m using macOS on the iPad’s display, I can simply reach out with my fingers and pinch on, say, a specific part of a photo I want to zoom in on. It’s a natural gesture that brings the direct manipulation we’ve gotten used to appreciating on touch-enabled devices to the Mac. I’m not saying that I’d like to control the macOS UI with touch all the time – some UI elements are too small to be tapped comfortably; I’m saying that for the <em>occasional</em> interaction, it’s nice to be able to touch a screen like we do hundreds of times each day for other devices in our lives.</p>
<p id="p101">Another nice use case for occasional touch interactions? Ripping the “display” apart from the MacBook and using the Apple Pencil to navigate and click around macOS.</p>

<p id="p103">Every once in a while, I’m doing something with my MacPad that requires reading for a while, such as editing an article for MacStories. A tablet – which lets you cozy up on a nice chair, put the screen on your lap or in front of your face as you’re lying down – is great for reading in a comfortable position for prolonged periods. A regular MacBook doesn’t let you do this. With my MacPad, I can detach the screen, and – if I want to continue using macOS for the task (the choice is always mine) – keep working with the Mac and use two fingers to scroll and the Pencil to click. Sidecar works just fine within a 10-meter distance when used wirelessly, and I can’t tell you how <em>nice</em> it is to have this kind of freedom for those times when you need it.</p>
<p id="p104">I also want to mention two Mac apps that have helped in this transition from a vanilla MacBook Air to the MacPad. Beyond the usual suspects (<a href="https://www.raycast.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raycast</a>, <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audio Hijack</a>, and <a href="https://www.macbartender.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bartender</a>), these apps have considerably sped up my MacPad workflow:</p>
<p id="p105"><strong><a href="https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnet</a>.</strong> There are dozens of tile-based window managers for macOS that aim to replicate the multitasking flow of Windows 11, but after trying a lot of them, I like Magnet for two specific reasons. First, it comes with easy-to-remember hotkeys for tiling windows to the left or right sides of the screen, which is an effective way to create split views without using <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-apps-in-split-view-mchl4fbe2921/mac" rel="noopener noreferrer">macOS’ actual Split View mode</a>:</p>

<p id="p107">More importantly, Magnet has a keyboard shortcut for cycling the window of the frontmost app between displays. On the off-chance that a window doesn’t open on my Sidecar display but is instead spawned on the non-existent built-in MacBook Air display, Magnet’s <code>⌃⌥⌘←/→</code> hotkeys let me instantly cycle that window across connected monitors, thus bringing it back to the iPad’s display.</p>
<p id="p108"><strong><a href="https://edovia.com/en/screens/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Screens</a>.</strong> It doesn’t get any better than Edovia’s Screens app when it comes to connecting via VNC to computers on your local network or available remotely. Screens is fundamental to my new MacPad workflow because it’s how I can type in my login password after a macOS reboot, but it’s also what I use to connect to my gaming PC to start streaming games to macOS or visionOS using <a href="https://moonlight-stream.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moonlight</a>.</p>
<h3 id="macos-and-ipados-together">macOS and iPadOS, Together</h3>
<p id="p109">We need to go deeper now.</p>
<p id="p110">What if I told you that, with my MacPad, I can use both macOS and iPadOS together, as in literally <em>at the same time</em>? This is where things get a bit wild, in a way that I wasn’t expecting when this experiment began.</p>
<p id="p111">A few weeks ago when I started using Sidecar, I noticed that – as long as my iPad had successfully authenticated on the Lock Screen with Face ID – I could toggle back and forth between macOS and iPadOS by swiping up on the Home indicator. As I noted above, Sidecar shows up as a special Continuity app in the iPad app switcher; you can use other iPad apps and then return to Sidecar, or you can quit the Sidecar app on the iPad to terminate the connection.</p>
<p id="p113">It was only when I disabled Stage Manager on my iPad Pro that I realized Sidecar would let me use macOS and iPadOS apps on the same display at once. Our <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/10/#slide-over" rel="noopener noreferrer">good old friend Slide Over</a> is one of the iPadOS UI elements to be allowed inside Sidecar’s display while macOS is active. Just swipe from the right edge of the display, bring in Slide Over, and you can use an iPad app while macOS is shown underneath.</p>

<p id="p115">The ability to use macOS and iPad apps in tandem has been a game-changer for me. There are some apps – like Music, Home, or Messages – that I prefer on the iPad as they lend themselves well to quick interactions that only require glancing at them briefly. (For instance, if I want to turn on a light in my office or respond with a Tapback to a message.) Instead of cluttering my Mac workspace with more windows, I can touch the screen, swipe for Slide Over, do what I have to do in an iPad app for a few seconds, and dismiss it.</p>

<p id="p117">I’m not constrained to a single iPad app either: Slide Over has supported multiple apps <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/21/#new-slide-over" rel="noopener noreferrer">for a few years now</a>; when invoked from inside Sidecar, Slide Over lets me cycle between multiple app windows and, if I realize I’m going to need more time with one of them, make it full-screen and leave macOS.</p>

<p id="p119">Another iPadOS UI element<sup id="fnref-74584-UIElements"><a href="#fn-74584-UIElements" rel="noopener noreferrer">6</a></sup> that is allowed to coexist with macOS while in Sidecar is the Picture in Picture player for videos (or, as we’ve seen on MacStories, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/yoink-brings-background-clipboard-monitoring-to-ios-and-ipados-15-via-picture-in-picture-workaround/" rel="noopener noreferrer">other apps that use the same technology</a>):</p>

<p id="p121">This is great for watching videos from an iPad app that doesn’t have a Mac counterpart while you’re still working with macOS, but it also brings me to another, bigger point: when using two OSes at once this way, you can listen to multiple audio sources at the same time – one from iPadOS, another from macOS.</p>

<p id="p123">This, of course, is something that has long been possible on the Mac, but never on the iPad, which still pauses a video if, for example, you start music playback somewhere else. Want to watch a video on mute on the Mac while you’re still listening to a podcast from <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pocket-casts-podcast-player/id414834813" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pocket Casts</a>, which doesn’t have a native Mac app? Just put Pocket Casts in Slide Over, play the video on the Mac, and both media streams can live together. This has always been the case for Sidecar, but it takes on a new meaning when the iPad itself becomes the primary display for a headless Mac laptop.</p>

<p id="p125">The advantages of Sidecar and Apple’s tightly integrated ecosystem don’t stop at media, however. When I’m using my MacPad, I can start a screen recording on iPadOS, switch over to macOS, and the recording will continue without interruptions. Here, let me show you with a video that I recorded from my MacPad:</p>

<p id="p127">Another integration that Apple built years ago and that also works beautifully with the MacPad is <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102430" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Clipboard</a>. Whether it’s some text I copied from the Mac or, say, an image I copied from the iPad’s Photos app, the clipboard will be instantly shared between platforms when Sidecar is active, allowing me to easily copy and paste between different apps and environments as if I was using one device.</p>
<hr id="hr128"><p id="p129">The best part of using macOS and iPadOS together with my MacPad has been the realization that doing this doesn’t feel weird at all. Quite the opposite: thanks to <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/macos-big-sur-the-macstories-review/4/#design-optimizing-for-modern-familiarity" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple’s consistent design language</a> and the common denominator of SwiftUI across modern apps, there are platform-specific differences between apps and OSes, but they are holistically consistent in a way that facilitates hopping between two distinct environments.</p>
<p id="p130">This, I believe, would be Apple’s greatest advantage against its competitors if only they invested in making the MacPad a real product: they already have a vibrant, deep ecosystem of apps based on a shared UI language that is equally optimized for each platform but consistent and familiar at the same time.</p>
<p id="p131">I say this as someone who worked with a Surface Pro 9 last year for six months and recently spent time exploring Android foldables: no other tech company on Earth currently has the same ecosystem strength, developer tooling, design foundation, and user-friendly approach as Apple here. The combination of iPadOS and macOS is, right now, already leagues above what Microsoft is doing with the Surface line; the only problem is that I had to build this hybrid device myself to prove it.</p>
<p id="p132">Not only is Apple well positioned to release a convertible laptop in the future, but their existing OSes and cross-device integrations already make for a fantastic experience with something like a MacPad <em>today</em>.</p>
<h2 id="questions-tidbits-and-other-setups">Questions, Tidbits, and Other Setups</h2>
<p id="p133">Below, I’ve compiled a list of some questions I had to figure out during the MacPad’s creation as well as examples of other setups for the MacPad’s modular system.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-sidecar-without-wi-fi">What About Sidecar without Wi-Fi?</h3>
<p id="p134">In case you’re not familiar with Sidecar, you can use this feature with both an iPad and Mac signed into the same Apple ID on a Wi-Fi network, or by connecting the two with a USB cable.</p>
<p id="p135">In my experience, aside from the occasional glitch that forced me to quit Sidecar and restart it, the USB connection hasn’t been necessary, which enabled me to keep the iPad charged while I was using macOS with it. My theory is that the issues I encountered were due to the iPad switching to the 6&nbsp;GHz band of my Wi-Fi 6E router; the 5&nbsp;GHz band has been more stable on a daily basis. As I wrote above, when using Sidecar over Wi-Fi, I didn’t notice any discernible latency or image artifacts.</p>
<p id="p136">But what about those times when I want to use the MacPad and don’t have a known Wi-Fi network to connect to – like, say, when I’m in my car? I solved that problem with an accessory <a href="https://club.macstories.net/posts/working-on-the-go-with-the-gl-inet-gl-mt3000-wifi-6-travel-router" rel="noopener noreferrer">John first brought to my attention</a>: a portable Wi-Fi router called <a href="https://amzn.to/49RSU85" rel="noopener noreferrer">GL-iNet Beryl AX3000</a>.</p>

<p id="p138">This small gadget, which is powered via USB-C, can create a Wi-Fi 6, 5&nbsp;GHz network by tethering over USB to my iPhone’s cellular plan. When I need to get work done with my MacPad in the car, I can just fire up the AX3000, wait for its Wi-Fi network to come back online, and wait for the iPad and Mac to connect to it automatically (it takes a few seconds). Then, wireless Sidecar will work just fine. I tested this in my car over the past few weeks, and it’s worked out perfectly.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-unlocking-the-mac">What About Unlocking the Mac?</h3>
<p id="p139">Since my MacBook Air no longer has a display lid, the computer’s built-in sensor that determines whether the computer is closed or not doesn’t work anymore. This is not a huge deal – I can always manually log out with ⌃⌘Q or wait for my computer to go to sleep on its own – but it’s caused a specific issue I had to solve.</p>

<p id="p141">With this kind of headless laptop setup, my recommendation is to disable automatic Apple Watch unlock and only rely on Touch ID for login instead. Without a lid always closed on top of it, my Apple Watch would continuously unlock the MacBook, even when it was stored in a bag while I was driving. (I use <a href="https://amzn.to/49xQNGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer">this sleeve</a> to hold both parts of the MacPad.) That made me nervous, so I decided to disable Apple Watch authentication, and I haven’t had any accidental logins since.</p>
<h3 id="ipados-mode-with-universal-control">iPadOS Mode with Universal Control</h3>
<p id="p142">For those times when I want to work with the more focused environment of iPadOS, I can rely on Universal Control to move the pointer and type on my iPad Pro. All I have to do is place my finger on the Mac’s Touch ID sensor to log in, then move the trackpad to the left, and the pointer lands on iPadOS.</p>

<p id="p144">As <a href="https://club.macstories.net/posts/the-macintosh-desktop-experience-my-universal-control-setup" rel="noopener noreferrer">we’ve known for a while</a>, this feature is glorious. But I will also add that, as of today, the best iPad Pro keyboard is a headless MacBook’s keyboard. Ironic, I know. But hear me out: the keyboard is quiet, the keys have nice travel but not too much, they’re backlit, and…there’s a function row. The same keys that control media playback or keys for Spotlight and Do Not Disturb work the same way on iPadOS while in Universal Control mode without having to remap anything. The trackpad is much more comfortable than the iPad’s Magic Keyboard one, and all the gestures for multitasking work too. It feels like using a more pro-level Magic Keyboard (which Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/" rel="noopener noreferrer">may announce soon</a>), except it’s actually a Mac.</p>
<p id="p145">The only downside here is that Sidecar needs to be turned off for Mac-to-iPad Universal Control to work. In the future, I hope Apple can find a way to let us use Universal Control when the Sidecar/Continuity “app” is running, but not in the foreground.</p>
<h3 id="ipad-as-a-tablet">iPad as a Tablet</h3>
<p id="p146">As for those times when I want to use the iPad as a tablet, well…I can just detach it from the MacPad’s magnetic structure, and it’s an iPad. Since I attached three magnets to the back of the smart cover I modded, I figured they could be useful when I’m using the iPad as a tablet as well. Sure enough, the magnets were a perfect fit for a <a href="https://amzn.to/3wIldaD" rel="noopener noreferrer">magnetic PopSocket</a>, which I can attach to the back of the iPad when I want to read an article or book for longer sessions:</p>

<p id="p148">I should also say that I tried both the 12.9” and 11” iPad Pro for my MacPad, and I prefer the smaller iPad Pro. For a while, I’ve been feeling like I was mostly using the 12.9” iPad Pro in laptop mode (with the Magic Keyboard) because the device was too big and heavy to be enjoyed as a tablet. The MacPad further cemented this idea and pushed me to stop using the 12.9” iPad Pro altogether.</p>
<p id="p149">For starters, while the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-pro-2021-review/#liquid-retina-xdr-display" rel="noopener noreferrer">12.9” iPad Pro display is better</a> and makes for a more visually balanced MacPad, the whole thing gets too heavy at 1900 grams – that’s 350 grams more than a 14” MacBook Pro. With an 11” iPad Pro, the MacPad weighs around 1650 grams, which is only 100 grams more than a MacBook Pro. The big iPad Pro flavor of the MacPad looked great with the larger screen and XDR display, but it was unwieldy, and I was constantly afraid the magnets wouldn’t hold.</p>

<p id="p151">More importantly, however, the 11” iPad Pro strikes a much better balance between large enough as a Mac display and small enough to be held as a tablet in my hands. Since I have real multitasking on the Mac, I disabled Stage Manager on the iPad Pro, and it reminded me of just how much <em>nicer</em> old-school Split View and Slide Over are on an iPad when you want to do less-intensive iPad things.</p>

<p id="p153">I can hold the 11” iPad Pro with both hands in landscape and type with the software keyboard using my thumbs; in portrait, I see more text than an iPad mini on a single page, and holding the device is not as awkward as doing the same with a 12.9” iPad. Plus, as <a href="https://club.macstories.net/posts/turning-the-11-ipad-pro-into-a-game-streaming-device" rel="noopener noreferrer">I showed in the Monthly Log for Club MacStories members</a>, the 11” iPad Pro also works great as a fake PlayStation Portal, which I created by modding the Galileo G8 game controller.</p>

<p id="p155">The MacPad made me an 11” iPad Pro believer. I can’t wait for this iPad model to carry an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/2024-ipad-pro-cad-drawings/" rel="noopener noreferrer">OLED display</a>.</p>
<h3 id="headless-mac-at-a-desk-with-a-studio-display">Headless Mac at a Desk with a Studio Display</h3>
<p id="p156">By making a headless MacBook Air, I was also able to simplify the setup at my desk with my Studio Display, which is where I record all my podcasts. Since my computer is now comprised of a keyboard and trackpad, I no longer need separate input accessories on my desk: I just need a single Thunderbolt cable, which connects the MacBook Air to Ethernet and the Studio Display via the <a href="https://amzn.to/3Iou9Vb" rel="noopener noreferrer">CalDigit TS4 dock</a>.</p>

<p id="p158">Those who have been following me for a while know how much I disliked having a keyboard and trackpad always on my desk only for those times when I needed to record. Now, when I’m not in the office, the desk is empty; and when I’m working, I only have to connect one cable to my “keyboard computer” to extend macOS to the Studio Display and use that as my primary monitor. I even switched to an <a href="https://amzn.to/3wrCKUr" rel="noopener noreferrer">angled USB-C connector</a> to create a straight connection between the cable and the computer:</p>

<p id="p160">Because my desk is now tidied up and clutter-free, I can use the space when I’m not working to put <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/macstories-unwind-godzilla-vs-ticcis-surprise-part-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer">my Z13 gaming PC</a>, which I use to stream games to macOS, iPadOS, or visionOS using <a href="https://app.lizardbyte.dev/Sunshine/?lng=en-US" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunshine</a> and <a href="https://moonlight-stream.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moonlight</a>.</p>
<h3 id="headless-mac-as-keyboard-and-trackpad-input-for-the-vision-pro">Headless Mac as Keyboard and Trackpad Input for the Vision Pro</h3>
<p id="p161">I saved the idea that started this whole journey for last.</p>
<p id="p162">As I suspected when I originally linked to Luke Miani’s YouTube video, a headless MacBook Air makes for the ultimate Vision Pro accessory: in a very compact, quiet, and powerful package, you have a Mac that you can use as a virtual display on the Vision Pro <em>and</em> as an input system that supports excellent typing with palm rejection features for its trackpad.</p>


<p id="p165">When I’m not using the MacPad, I use Mac Virtual Display. I love the feature so much, I’m thinking about selling my Studio Display, which is just taking up space on a wall at this point. Sure, the resolution of Mac Virtual Display isn’t as good as a physical Studio Display; however, a Studio Display can’t become a giant monitor in front of my eyes that can coexist with other large visionOS windows. In many ways, I believe that, for my use case, the Vision Pro is the most impressive Mac monitor I own: the trade-off in image quality is balanced by its portability and freedom to use a large Mac interface anywhere I am.</p>
<p id="p166">As is the case with Universal Control on the iPad, you can’t use Sidecar and Mac Virtual Display at the same time. While in pure headless mode, the Vision Pro still recognizes the MacBook Air in front of me and displays a ‘Connect’ button where the physical display used to be. When it doesn’t do that, I can just connect to the Mac from visionOS’ Control Center.</p>

<h3 id="more-questions">More Questions</h3>
<p id="p168">Here are answers to some common questions I received from friends who read the story in advance:</p>
<p id="p169"><strong>Can the MacPad use the iPad’s webcam while in Sidecar?</strong> Sadly, no. <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/macos-ventura-the-macstories-review/3/#continuity-camera" rel="noopener noreferrer">Continuity Camera</a> is another feature that is unavailable while Sidecar is active. If I need to be on a video call while using the MacPad in macOS mode, I can plug in my <a href="https://amzn.to/49xqqAX" rel="noopener noreferrer">Opal Tadpole portable webcam</a> and attach it to the iPad Pro’s bezel; otherwise, I can just switch to iPadOS mode with Universal Control and use the iPad’s front-facing camera (which I hope moves to the landscape side in the next iPad Pros).</p>
<p id="p170"><strong>What are the full weight comparisons between the 12.9” and 11” iPad Pro versions?</strong> Here are the numbers:</p>
<ul id="ul171"><li>MacPad with 11” iPad Pro (ESR back cover): 1650 grams (3.63 lbs)</li>
<li>MacPad with 12.9” iPad Pro (<a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/leather-folio-black-ipad-pro-12-9-inch" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nomad leather back cover</a>): 1900 grams (4.18 lbs)</li>
<li>MacBook Air 13”: 1240 grams (2.73 lbs)</li>
<li>MacBook Pro 14” (M3): 1550 grams (3.41 lbs)</li>
</ul><p id="p172">Essentially, for 100 grams more than a MacBook Pro, I get two computers instead of one with my 11” MacPad.</p>
<p id="p173">If you have more questions, feel free to ask them in the <a href="https://club.macstories.net/faq/discord" rel="noopener noreferrer">Club MacStories Discord</a>, and I’ll try my best to answer them tomorrow in the live Q&amp;A we’re doing with members.</p>
<p id="p174"><strong>How do you charge both devices?</strong> I can plug in a USB-C cable in each device using my <a href="https://amzn.to/3ThJPjA" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anker GaN Prime charger</a> when I’m home, or via the <a href="https://amzn.to/3TjuRcR" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anker Prime battery</a> when I’m out and about. I should note, however, that by not having a built-in display anymore, the MacBook Air’s battery lasts <em>forever</em> now, which is a nice perk of this project.</p>
<h2 id="my-future-is-a-macpad">My Future Is a MacPad</h2>

<p id="p177">It’s funny: the MacPad, a product that doesn’t exist and that I created by modding a MacBook Air, is a testament to the incredible strength of Apple’s ecosystem.</p>
<p id="p178">Apple doesn’t offer a MacPad (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-11/apple-working-on-adding-touch-screens-to-macs-in-major-turnabout" rel="noopener noreferrer">yet</a>), but they’ve been developing the technologies that could make it possible for a long time. It’s only because of the integration between hardware and software in the Apple ecosystem that I was able to turn two computers into one and use it with basically zero issues.</p>
<p id="p180">There are several lessons to be learned from this story. For starters, you shouldn’t have to do this yourself if all you’re looking for is a better input accessory for the Vision Pro: Apple should make that device, and it’s silly that they haven’t updated their standalone keyboard and trackpad in years. I’m fully aware that what I’ve done is absurd, even if it worked out well in the end.</p>
<p id="p181">Second, Sidecar is surprisingly resilient: I’ve gotten so used to working with my MacPad now, I sometimes forget I’m using a wireless display that’s actually an iPad running a different operating system. The teams at Apple working on Sidecar, Universal Control, and Mac Virtual Display are responsible for truly remarkable engineering feats that are fast, secure, powerful, and intuitive. These features are quintessential Apple, and I’m so happy whenever I use them. The fact that I’m now using macOS almost entirely with virtual screens says a lot about the quality of these functionalities.</p>
<p id="p182">Additionally, the setup I created will immediately scale to new iPad Pros as soon as they’re released: I’ll just need to buy another smart cover I can mod. And thanks to the MacPad, I’ll have an OLED MacBook months (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/macbook-pro-oled-three-years-away/" rel="noopener noreferrer">years</a>?) before those products are released. OLED is going to be a glorious addition to my MacPad setup.</p>
<p id="p183">Most importantly, however, making the MacPad has shown me that it’s so liberating to use a convertible Apple computer that can be both a laptop and tablet at the same time.</p>
<p id="p184">At a moment’s notice, I can go from working with a laptop to holding a tablet in my hands, and the user experience doesn’t suffer because of the transition. Likewise, by blending macOS and iPadOS apps on the same display, I can have the best of both worlds: the power and versatility of the Mac, and the nimble nature and richer app ecosystem of the iPad.</p>
<p id="p185">It all started because I wanted a better keyboard for my Vision Pro, and I ended up accidentally creating the Apple computer of my dreams: a Mac-iPad hybrid with two form factors I love, and none of the constraints of either of them. After using my MacPad for the past weeks, there’s one key takeaway:</p>
<p id="p186">An official Apple one can’t come soon enough.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>There are a lot of things I want to do. I want to create and build and make and write.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there are other things that I just have to do, like bookkeeping and responding to emails.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it all gets to be too much. There are too many things to do! I need to figure out where to start! I get
paralyzed by the sheer enormity of it all.</p>
<p>This has happened enough times that I know the solution: do literally anything.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter what! Write half of an article. Categorize two expenses. Write down all your ideas for videos. Clean
your office. Respond to a single email.</p>
<p>By doing anything, I find momentum. I find motivation! I ease the heavy feeling and find my stride. The mere act of
doing pushes back the tidal wave of thoughts.</p>
<p>The problem is primarily emotional. I feel paralyzed.</p>
<p>The solution is primarily emotional too! Just do one thing.</p>
<p>By doing one thing, I feel like maybe things are doable after all. And if things are doable, then maybe I can do more
things!</p>
<p>Progress leads to progress, motion to motion.</p>
<p>There have been times when I've looked at the amount of stuff that needs to be done and thought: "everything is
impossible. Nothing can ever be finished. There's no way that anything in the universe has ever been done."</p>
<p>And since there's no way that all of this can be done, I'm just gonna sit here and worry about everything that needs to
be done!</p>
<p>Do literally anything.</p>
<p>Make progress on literally anything.</p>
<p>It may not be rational, but it is helpful, so who cares if it's rational? Certainly not me.</p>
<p>It's a solution to overwhelm, but I've found it's also a solution for another issue: underwhelm. Aimlessness!</p>
<p>The complete opposite problem! Having too little to do or not knowing what you want to do.</p>
<p>If I'm stuck thinking, "I don't know what I want the next phase of my career to be," or "I don't have any ideas for
videos," or "I don't know what projects to build," the answer is the same: do literally anything.</p>
<p>Know that it's okay to change course once you've started. It's okay to start something and then realize something might
be better for you. That's the beauty of action; it opens paths you wouldn't have seen earlier.</p>
<p>You'll rarely discover "what's next" by standing still. Start working on <em>something</em>. Start tinkering. That will put you
in motion to figure out what "the thing" is.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed? Underwhelmed?</p>
<p>Do literally anything.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Embedded software is used in safety-critical systems such as medical devices and autonomous vehicles, where software defects, including security vulnerabilities, have severe consequences. Most embedded codebases are developed in unsafe languages, specifically C/C++, and are riddled with memory safety vulnerabilities. To prevent such vulnerabilities, RUST, a performant memory-safe systems language, provides an optimal choice for developing embedded software. RUST interoperability enables developing RUST applications on top of existing C codebases. Despite this, even the most resourceful organizations continue to develop embedded software in C/C++. This paper performs the first systematic study to holistically understand the current state and challenges of using RUST for embedded systems. Our study is organized across three research questions. We collected a dataset of 2,836 RUST embedded software spanning various categories and 5 Static Application Security Testing ( SAST) tools. We performed a systematic analysis of our dataset and surveys with 225 developers to investigate our research questions. We found that existing RUST software support is inadequate, SAST tools cannot handle certain features of RUST embedded software, resulting in failures, and the prevalence of advanced types in existing RUST software makes it challenging to engineer interoperable code. In addition, we found various challenges faced by developers in using RUST for embedded systems development.

The family includes three state-of-the-art models in ascending order of capability: Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3 Sonnet, and Claude 3 Opus. Each successive model offers increasingly powerful performance, allowing users to select the optimal balance of intelligence, speed, and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/api#pricing">cost</a> for their specific application.</p><p>Opus and Sonnet are now available to use in claude.ai and the Claude API which is now generally available in <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/supported-countries">159 countries</a>. Haiku will be available soon.</p><h4>Claude 3 model family</h4><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2200" height="1174" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F5d20371eeb8d045465bb22cacfd269b5958b004d-2200x1174.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F5d20371eeb8d045465bb22cacfd269b5958b004d-2200x1174.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure><h4>A new standard for intelligence</h4><p>Opus, our most intelligent model, outperforms its peers on most of the common evaluation benchmarks for AI systems, including undergraduate level expert knowledge (MMLU), graduate level expert reasoning (GPQA), basic mathematics (GSM8K), and more. It exhibits near-human levels of comprehension and fluency on complex tasks, leading the frontier of general intelligence.</p><p>All <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-3-model-card">Claude 3</a> models show increased capabilities in analysis and forecasting, nuanced content creation, code generation, and conversing in non-English languages like Spanish, Japanese, and French.</p><p>Below is a comparison of the Claude 3 models to those of our peers on multiple benchmarks [1] of capability:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2200" height="1954" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F9ad98d612086fe52b3042f9183414669b4d2a3da-2200x1954.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F9ad98d612086fe52b3042f9183414669b4d2a3da-2200x1954.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure><h4>Near-instant results</h4><p>The Claude 3 models can power live customer chats, auto-completions, and data extraction tasks where responses must be immediate and in real-time.</p><p>Haiku is the fastest and most cost-effective model on the market for its intelligence category. It can read an information and data dense research paper on arXiv (~10k tokens) with charts and graphs in less than three seconds. Following launch, we expect to improve performance even further.</p><p>For the vast majority of workloads, Sonnet is 2x faster than Claude 2 and Claude 2.1 with higher levels of intelligence. It excels at tasks demanding rapid responses, like knowledge retrieval or sales automation. Opus delivers similar speeds to Claude 2 and 2.1, but with much higher levels of intelligence.</p><h4>Strong vision capabilities</h4><p>The Claude 3 models have sophisticated vision capabilities on par with other leading models. They can process a wide range of visual formats, including photos, charts, graphs and technical diagrams. We’re particularly excited to provide this new modality to our enterprise customers, some of whom have up to 50% of their knowledge bases encoded in various formats such as PDFs, flowcharts, or presentation slides.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2200" height="960" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F6b66d86ff0c180e95bc6ad2e6e4a1843aa74c80f-2200x960.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F6b66d86ff0c180e95bc6ad2e6e4a1843aa74c80f-2200x960.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure><h4>Less refusals</h4><p>Previous Claude models often made unnecessary refusals that suggested a lack of contextual understanding. We’ve made meaningful progress in this area: Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku are significantly less likely to refuse to answer prompts that border on the system’s guardrails than previous generations of models. As shown below, the Claude 3 models show a more nuanced understanding of requests, recognize real harm, and refuse to answer harmless prompts much less often.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2188" height="918" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fd1fbcf3d58ebc2dcd2e98aac995d70bf50cb2e9c-2188x918.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fd1fbcf3d58ebc2dcd2e98aac995d70bf50cb2e9c-2188x918.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure><h4>Improved accuracy</h4><p>Businesses of all sizes rely on our models to serve their customers, making it imperative for our model outputs to maintain high accuracy at scale. To assess this, we use a large set of complex, factual questions that target known weaknesses in current models. We categorize the responses into correct answers, incorrect answers (or hallucinations), and admissions of uncertainty, where the model says it doesn’t know the answer instead of providing incorrect information. Compared to Claude 2.1, Opus demonstrates a twofold improvement in accuracy (or correct answers) on these challenging open-ended questions while also exhibiting reduced levels of incorrect answers.</p><p>In addition to producing more trustworthy responses, we will soon enable citations in our Claude 3 models so they can point to precise sentences in reference material to verify their answers.<br></p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2200" height="896" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F7cb598c6a9fa58c12b77f67ee2067feaac4a2de0-2200x896.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F7cb598c6a9fa58c12b77f67ee2067feaac4a2de0-2200x896.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure><h4>Long context and near-perfect recall</h4><p>The Claude 3 family of models will initially offer a 200K context window upon launch. However, all three models are capable of accepting inputs exceeding 1 million tokens and we may make this available to select customers who need enhanced processing power.</p><p>To process long context prompts effectively, models require robust recall capabilities. The 'Needle In A Haystack' (NIAH) evaluation measures a model's ability to accurately recall information from a vast corpus of data. We enhanced the robustness of this benchmark by using one of 30 random needle/question pairs per prompt and testing on a diverse crowdsourced corpus of documents. Claude 3 Opus not only achieved near-perfect recall, surpassing 99% accuracy, but in some cases, it even identified the limitations of the evaluation itself by recognizing that the "needle" sentence appeared to be artificially inserted into the original text by a human.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2200" height="1088" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fd2aa12b60e9c57e7057924bd8878d754c7b3d8e7-2200x1088.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fd2aa12b60e9c57e7057924bd8878d754c7b3d8e7-2200x1088.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure><h4>Responsible design</h4><p>We’ve developed the Claude 3 family of models to be as trustworthy as they are capable. We have several dedicated teams that track and mitigate a broad spectrum of risks, ranging from misinformation and CSAM to biological misuse, election interference, and autonomous replication skills. We continue to develop methods such as <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback">Constitutional AI</a> that improve the safety and transparency of our models, and have tuned our models to mitigate against privacy issues that could be raised by new modalities.</p><p>Addressing biases in increasingly sophisticated models is an ongoing effort and we’ve made strides with this new release. As shown in the model card, Claude 3 shows less biases than our previous models according to the <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-acl.165/">Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ)</a>. We remain committed to advancing techniques that reduce biases and promote greater neutrality in our models, ensuring they are not skewed towards any particular partisan stance.</p><p>While the Claude 3 model family has advanced on key measures of biological knowledge, cyber-related knowledge, and autonomy compared to previous models, it remains at AI Safety Level 2 (ASL-2) per our <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy">Responsible Scaling Policy</a>. Our <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/red-teaming-language-models-to-reduce-harms-methods-scaling-behaviors-and-lessons-learned">red teaming</a> evaluations (performed in line with our <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/">White House commitments</a> and the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/">2023 US Executive Order</a>) have concluded that the models present negligible potential for catastrophic risk at this time. We will continue to carefully monitor future models to assess their proximity to the ASL-3 threshold. Further safety details are available in the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-3-model-card">Claude 3 model card</a>.<br></p><h4>Easier to use</h4><p>The Claude 3 models are better at following complex, multi-step instructions. They are particularly adept at adhering to brand voice and response guidelines, and developing customer-facing experiences our users can trust. In addition, the Claude 3 models are better at producing popular structured output in formats like JSON—making it simpler to instruct Claude for use cases like natural language classification and sentiment analysis.<br></p><h4>Model details</h4><p><strong>Claude 3 Opus </strong>is our most intelligent model, with best-in-market performance on highly complex tasks. It can navigate open-ended prompts and sight-unseen scenarios with remarkable fluency and human-like understanding.

</figure><p>More than one-quarter of scholarly articles are not being properly archived and preserved, a study of more than seven million digital publications suggests. The findings, published in the <i>Journal of Librarianship and Scholarly Communication</i> on 24 January<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>, indicate that systems to preserve papers online have failed to keep pace with the growth of research output.</p><p>“Our entire epistemology of science and research relies on the chain of footnotes,” explains author Martin Eve, a researcher in literature, technology and publishing at Birkbeck, University of London. “If you can’t verify what someone else has said at some other point, you’re just trusting to blind faith for artefacts that you can no longer read yourself.”</p><p>Eve, who is also involved in research and development at digital-infrastructure organization Crossref, checked whether 7,438,037 works labelled with digital object identifiers (DOIs) are held in archives. DOIs — which consist of a string of numbers, letters and symbols — are unique fingerprints used to identify and link to specific publications, such as scholarly articles and official reports. Crossref is the largest DOI registration agency, allocating the identifiers to about 20,000 members, including publishers, museums and other institutions.</p><p>The sample of DOIs included in the study was made up of a random selection of up to 1,000 registered to each member organization. Twenty-eight percent of these works — more than two million articles — did not appear in a major digital archive, despite having an active DOI. Only 58% of the DOIs referenced works that had been stored in at least one archive. The other 14% were excluded from the study because they were published too recently, were not journal articles or did not have an identifiable source.</p><h2>Preservation challenge</h2><p>Eve notes that the study has limitations: namely that it tracked only articles with DOIs, and that it did not search every digital repository for articles (he did not check whether items with a DOI were stored in institutional repositories, for example).</p><p>Nevertheless, preservation specialists have welcomed the analysis. “It’s been hard to know the real extent of the digital preservation challenge faced by e-journals,” says William Kilbride, managing director of the Digital Preservation Coalition, headquartered in York, UK. The coalition publishes a handbook detailing good preservation practice.</p><p>“Many people have the blind assumption that if you have a DOI, it’s there forever,” says Mikael Laakso, who studies scholarly publishing at the Hanken School of Economics in Helsinki. “But that doesn’t mean that the link will always work.” In 2021, Laakso and his colleagues reported<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup> that more than 170 open-access journals had disappeared from the Internet between 2000 and 2019.</p><p>Kate Wittenberg, managing director of the digital archiving service Portico in New York City, warns that small publishers are at higher risk of failing to preserve articles than are large ones. “It costs money to preserve content,” she says, adding that archiving involves infrastructure, technology and expertise that many smaller organizations do not have access to.</p><p>Eve’s study suggests some measures that could improve digital preservation, including stronger requirements at DOI registration agencies and better education and awareness of the issue among publishers and researchers.</p><p>“Everybody thinks of the immediate gains they might get from having a paper out somewhere, but we really should be thinking about the long-term sustainability of the research ecosystem,” Eve says. “After you’ve been dead for 100 years, are people going to be able to get access to the things you’ve worked on?”</p>

		Singapore Airlines once operated a Concorde between the Lion City and London, but politics and economics meant it didn't last.	</p><div>
		
<p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Singapore Airlines operated the world’s most popular supersonic passenger airliner – Concorde – on flights between Singapore and London, as part of a joint venture with British Airways.</p>






<p>The service slashed flying times between Asia and Europe from around 18 hours on subsonic aircraft with multiple stops to under 10 hours, for those who could afford a ticket some 15% more expensive than a First Class fare.</p>

<p>Catering mainly to time-pressed business travellers, celebrities and politicians, the service was short-lived as it suffered from waning demand and rising fuel costs, leading to heavy losses.</p>



<p>Scratch a little below the surface though, and the story of Concorde’s time with Singapore Airlines is a fascinating one, mired in politics of one sort or another from almost start to finish.</p>



<p><strong>Here’s our look back at how the history of SIA’s Concorde operation unfolded.</strong></p>









<h3 id="0-concorde-in-singapore">Concorde in Singapore</h3>



<p>The history of Concorde in Singapore dates right back to 1972. On 8th June that year, <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19720608-1.2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thousands flocked</a> to Singapore International Airport at Paya Lebar to watch the first Concorde land from Bangkok on its promotional sales tour.</p>



<p>Singapore was seen as a key stopover point for Concorde’s future ambitions to cut travel times from Europe to Australia, so the manufacturer was keen to woo the government and regulators here to ensure smooth permissions would be granted in future, even if SIA itself didn’t buy the jets.</p>

<p>After three days in Singapore the aircraft left for Hong Kong and Tokyo, later flying to Australia before returning via Singapore once again on its way back to Europe.</p>



<h3 id="1-sia-wanted-its-own-concordes">SIA wanted its own Concordes</h3>



<p>In June 1975, six Singapore Airlines cabin crew <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19750622-1.2.24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were handpicked</a> to take part in trials by the aircraft manufacturer, simulating normal passenger service from London to cities like Beirut, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Melbourne.</p>



<p>It was a great coup for the airline to demonstrate how SIA’s renowned service could still be offered on a supersonic flight, and by September that year it was reported that <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19750927-1.2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Singapore Airlines was negotiating to lease two Concordes</a>.</p>



<p>The proposed arrangement would start in 1977, for operation between Australia and Europe via the Lion City. Flight times between Singapore and London would be cut from 18 hours on conventional aircraft at the time to just 10 hours.</p>






<p>With a S$100 million price tag per jet (S$257 million in today’s money), buying the aircraft was <em>“out of the question”</em> according to SIA’s Managing Director Lim Chin Beng, but the carrier was said to be keen if an acceptable lease deal could be forged.</p>



<p>The pair of aircraft would have replaced two Boeing 747s the airline had on option for delivery in 1977 and 1978.</p>

<p>However, that plan never materialised.</p>



<p>Over a year later, in November 1976, British Airways (BA) was negotiating with the Singapore Government to start a London – Bahrain – Singapore service using Concorde, while the airline was still blocked from flying the jet to and from New York – its most desired route.</p>



<p>It was proposed that <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19761103-1.2.51" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SIA would lease 20 out of 100 seats</a> on each of these flights to address <em>“the likely loss of First Class passengers”</em> on SIA’s own London services.</p>



<h3 id="2-india-refused-overflight">India refused overflight</h3>



<p>BA’s problems weren’t isolated to a ‘forced pact’ with SIA on a future Singapore route. It didn’t take long for <strong>politics</strong> to start getting in the way of plans to fly Concorde to and from Asia.</p>



<p>In the late 1970s, India refused permission for Concorde to fly over its airspace, blocking a direct routing from Bahrain to Singapore, BA’s proposed extension to an existing service.</p>



<p>On the table was more access to Heathrow slots for Air India, plus ‘fifth freedom’ traffic rights from the London airport, with the airline keen to tap in to the lucrative transatlantic market. In the 1970s and 80s, it was common for governments to use air traffic agreements as political chess pieces.</p>



<div><p><strong>Sonic Boom </strong>It’s worth mentioning at this point that the problem for Concorde was primarily related to its ‘Sonic Boom’, caused by shock waves when the jet was travelling through the air at Mach 1 or greater. That was no problem for the passengers; sitting on the jet at the head of the ‘Mach cone’, they were moving so fast the sonic boom didn’t have chance to catch up to them.</p><p>
<b>For those on the ground it was a different matter, creating a 100dB+ sound like an explosion.</b></p><p>
That meant supersonic flight by Concorde was restricted to overwater or sparsely populated land masses like deserts. Even that wasn’t perfect though, with Saudi Arabia withdrawing supersonic permission for Concorde after nomads reported the sonic boom was upsetting their camels, stopping them from breeding!</p></div>



<p>Ultimately the two sides agreed to a compromise, with Concorde flights from Bahrain to Singapore having to route around the Indian mainland, adding 200 miles to the journey.</p>



<h3 id="3-joint-venture-with-british-airways">Joint venture with British Airways</h3>



<p>By late 1977 Singapore Airlines was in negotiation with British Airways to jointly operate a Concorde on the London – Singapore route under a cost and revenue-sharing basis. The supersonic trip would <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19770824-1.2.65.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut flying time to 10 hours</a>, with only a 40-minute refuelling stop in Bahrain.</p>



<p>Plans included an extension of the route from Singapore to Melbourne, Australia, though this never went ahead.</p>

<p>Singapore Airlines formally made an <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19771023-1.2.31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreement</a> for the joint venture Concorde operation with British Airways in October 1977, with the inaugural service from Paya Lebar planned for 10th December that year.</p>



<p>As part of the deal, SIA <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19771029-1.2.20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent 36 of its cabin crew to London</a> in November 1977 for training on Concorde operations.</p>



<p>Tickets could be purchased at BA or SIA offices and cost around 15% more than First Class fares on existing subsonic flights between the two cities.</p>






<p>The one-way fare was S$4,298 (around S$10,700 today) from Singapore to London and S$2,522 (around S$6,300 today) from Singapore to Bahrain.</p>





<p>British Airways said it needed to fill 60 of the 100 seats on board to break even, though the capacity was capped at 86 passengers when departing from Singapore due to the humid conditions affecting the aircraft’s performance.</p>



<p>Even with the inaugural flights fully booked, Singapore Airlines launched a global <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19771202-1.2.75" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advertising campaign</a> in December 1977, telling the world <em>“SIA has gone supersonic”</em>.</p>

<p>Part of the agreement between Singapore Airlines and British Airways was to operate the Concorde, registered G-BOAD (also temporarily G-N94AD), in a dual livery with Singapore Airlines titles on the left and British Airways colours on the right of the aircraft.</p>

<p>This became the only Concorde to fly with the colours of two different airlines, making SIA only the third airline in the world (after BA and Air France) to have its livery on the type.</p>

<p>With passengers boarding via steps in Singapore in those days, into the forward left main aircraft door, it meant only the SIA livery was visible.</p>



<h3 id="5-the-inaugural-flight-was-almost-scuppered">The inaugural flight was almost scuppered</h3>



<p>Prior to the start of the route, there was a disagreement between British Airways and a small group of its Concorde pilots who were to be stationed in Singapore, over the terms and conditions of their detachment. This was resolved a few weeks before the first flight, but a much bigger problem was looming.</p>



<p>With a Concorde now adorned in Singapore Airlines colours down one side and British Airways livery across the other, and cabin crew from both carriers fully trained to jointly operate the new service, a spanner was suddenly thrown in the works.</p>






<p>At the eleventh hour, on 7th December 1977, the Malaysian Government threatened to hold back overflight rights for the new service. Malaysia had presented no formal reasons to deny Concorde’s overflight of its airspace, indeed the jet had previously routed over the country on demonstration flights and made several landings at Kuala Lumpur’s Subang Airport.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We were told verbally yesterday by the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation that overflying rights have still not been granted.</p>



<p>“No reasons have been given, either verbally or in writing.</p>



<p>“We don’t know whether this refers to supersonic or subsonic speed, but if they allow us to fly subsonic, we will do so.</p>



<p>“It will add several minutes to the flying time, but it is not significant.”</p>
<cite>Ted Duggan, British Airways PR Manager for the Orient, 8th December 1977 (via <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19771208-1.2.4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Nation</a>)</cite></blockquote>



<p>The day before the inaugural flight was due to depart, the Malaysians formally refused all overflight permission for Concorde, subsonic or supersonic.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The Malaysian authorities have decided to refuse permission for the Concorde flight over Malaysian airspace.”</p>
<cite>Malaysian Communications Ministry (via <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19771209-1.2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Straits Times</a>)</cite></blockquote>



<p>No reason was given, though later a minister said they had to <em>“look into matters affecting the people’s interests and environmental factors”</em>.</p>



<p>Several newspapers in London <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19771210-1.2.4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were having none of it</a>, stating that the <em>“extremely puzzling”</em> stance was <em>“likely [because] Malaysia is piqued at the operation by Singapore [Airlines] of Concorde service”.</em></p>



<p>An aviation source said of Malaysia’s environmental reasoning <em>“Rubbish, absolute rubbish. The problem is purely political”</em>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“When Britain first approached Kuala Lumpur earlier this year for permission to fly over Malaysia, the contemplated service would have been wholly British.</p>



<p>“But sources said Malaysia’s objections crystallised when British Airways and Singapore [Airlines] agreed to operate the flight jointly.”</p>
<cite><a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19771210-1.2.4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Times</a>, 10th December 1977</cite></blockquote>



<p>While the Malaysians were standing firm, the Singapore Government came to the rescue, striking a last-minute deal with Indonesia for the aircraft to route slightly further south than originally planned, through Jakarta’s airspace instead.</p>



<p>The agreement was <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19771212-1.2.3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> to have been a reciprocal gesture, following <em>“Singapore’s support for Indonesia during a recent United Nations debate on East Timor”</em>.</p>



<p>The route was saved and the inaugural flight, which had started to look as though it would have to be postponed, took off from London as scheduled on 9th December 1977, to a traditional ceremonial lion dance.</p>

<p>The flight touched down in Singapore at 5.35am the following morning, 25 minutes early, with Singapore Airlines cabin crew having taken over from the BA crew in Bahrain.</p>

<p>Only 90 passengers could be accommodated instead of the planned 100, due to the additional fuel required when taking the Indonesia routing, while only 70 passengers could travel from Singapore to Bahrain instead of the planned 86, for the same reason.</p>

<h3 id="6-malaysia-stands-firm">Malaysia stands firm</h3>



<p>On 12th December 1977, the day of the second Concorde departure from Singapore to London, authorities revealed a new hiccup.</p>



<p><strong>Indonesia’s overflight permission for the aircraft <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19771212-1.2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was only valid for one week</a>, covering the first three flights.</strong></p>



<p>That’s because the original agreement had been hammered out at a meeting between Singapore officials, British Airways and the Indonesian Directorate General of Air Communications, during an aviation conference taking place in the Lion City a few days earlier. It was therefore regarded as a temporary operational measure, valid only for a week.</p>



<p>Indonesian Government approval was not required, but would be needed for a longstanding agreement beyond the initial flights.</p>






<p>British Airways Captain Tony Meadows, who flew Concorde on its inaugural flight into Singapore from Bahrain on 10th December 1977, was dispatched to Jakarta later that day to assist British officials there <em>“on any issue”</em> related to the flights.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gordon Davidson, British Airways Concorde Director, remained in the region rather than returning back to London as planned, and instead headed to the British High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, hopeful a deal could be struck with Malaysia to end the quagmire.</p>



<h3 id="7-indonesia-wouldnt-commit">Indonesia wouldn’t commit</h3>



<p>Not wishing to upset its friendly relations with Malaysia, the Indonesian Government was reluctant to approve further overflight permissions beyond the first three services, potentially leaving Britain and Singapore back at square one.</p>



<p>Striking a deal with Malaysia was seemingly the only option, though British Airways did not seem overly confident.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“If the problem is genuinely environmental, then we should certainly be able to convince them…</p>



<p>“If Malaysia’s decision is based on reasons of professional rivalry, however, then there is nothing we can do about it.”</p>
<cite>British Airways official, 13th December 1977 (via <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19771213-1.2.56" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Times</a>)</cite></blockquote>



<p>With the third and final service blessed with Indonesian overflight approval already on its way to Singapore, last-minute talks with Kuala Lumpur were still ongoing. Indonesia said it would only approve overflight <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19771216-1.2.8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if the Malaysians also did so</a>.</p>



<p>That wasn’t much use to British Airways or Singapore Airlines – they needed agreement from one or the other. The Indonesian stance meant it was all or nothing.</p>



<p>The fourth Concorde flight BA300 departed from London bound for Bahrain and Singapore on Friday 16th December 1977 as planned, <strong>with no one knowing whether it would be allowed to continue its journey</strong> from the Middle East.</p>



<p>Even with Britain suggesting <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19771215-1.2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a compromise</a> ‘interim agreement’ for three months while discussions were ongoing, Malaysia then <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19771217-1.2.6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaffirmed their refusal</a> of overflight permission, meaning the Concorde was forced to return to London after arriving in Bahrain that night.</p>



<p>16 passengers who boarded in London destined for Singapore, who were reportedly <em>“very unhappy”</em>, were reaccommodated in First Class on subsonic flights.</p>



<p>Later asked why he had not intervened in the negotiations, instead leaving it to the British, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“If I believed that there was anything I could say or write or do that would help, I would have done so.</p>



<p>“There are times where there is nothing one can do better, than to do nothing.”</p>
<cite><meta charset="utf-8">Lee Kuan Yew, December 1977 (via <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19771231-1.2.11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Nation</a>)</cite></blockquote>



<p>Fundamentally LKY was right about the issue – it really wasn’t for Singapore or SIA to get involved in what was an agreement purely between the British and the Malaysians. As the Business Times put it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“SIA is merely the British company’s operating partner. It does not own the Concorde nor has it leased the aeroplane. The entire issue of overflying is therefore solely between Britain and Malaysia.”</p>
<cite><a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19780127-1.2.22?ST=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Times</a>, January 1978</cite></blockquote>



<h3 id="8-1978-free-advertising">1978: Free advertising!</h3>



<p>With all the political obstacles for overflight permissions related to this route, it would probably have been easy for all parties involved to simply abandon the idea after these three return flights were completed.</p>



<p>British Airways, Singapore Airlines and their respective governments were undeterred, however, and remained fully committed to the concept. <em>“The route will be back”</em>, said one SIA official.</p>






<p>The aircraft’s dual colour scheme, with SIA livery on the left and BA livery on the right, was therefore retained in anticipation of the Singapore route’s return.</p>



<p>That gave SIA the unique opportunity for <strong>some lucrative free advertising</strong> during 1978, with G-BOAD fitting back in to regular BA Concorde operation around the world.</p>

<p>The aircraft regularly visited Bahrain, New York, Washington D.C. and Dallas on scheduled services.</p>



<p>There were even charter flights, including the use of G-BOAD in 1978 on a Barcelona – New York flight for the top customers of a large Spanish bank!</p>



<h3 id="9-malaysia-agreement">Malaysia agreement</h3>



<p>After a series of talks between Britain and Malaysia throughout 1978, most of which came to nothing, a breakthrough was finally reached on 15th December that year.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“On 15 December 1978, one year after the end of the first services the Malaysian Government withdrew its objections to Concorde flights for a trial period.”</p>
<cite>Singapore Airlines statement</cite></blockquote>



<p>Malaysian officials had finally agreed to lift the overflight ban for SIA-BA Concorde services for an initial period of six months, in what SIA’s Managing Director Mr. K. Kulasegaran <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19781216-1.2.9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">described as</a> <em>“terrific news, quite the best I have heard for a long time”</em>.</p>






<p>The decision was reached after a year-long study by Malaysia revealed <em>“no conclusive evidence”</em> that Concorde flights over its airspace would damage the environment. Indonesia also granted joint permission for the service to be reinstated using its airspace on the same basis.</p>



<h3 id="10-1979-services-restart">1979: Services restart</h3>



<p>With an agreement sealed, SQ300/301 (also operated as BA300/301) was back on, with three-times weekly flights restarted from London on Wednesday 24th January 1979 and the first Singapore – London flight operating the following day.</p>

<h3 id="11-the-schedule">The schedule</h3>



<p>The dual-liveried Concorde G-BOAD was a busy aircraft, flying three times a week between London and Singapore in each direction.</p>



<p>Only on Tuesdays did the jet get a decent break, with 48 hours off in London for maintenance downtime from Monday afternoon through to Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Actual flying time from Singapore to London was 8 hours 15 minutes, plus a 50-minute stop in Bahrain for a total time of 9 hours 5 minutes.</p>



<p>Flight time between London and Singapore, was 8 hours 20 minutes (9 hours 10 minutes once the stop in Bahrain was accounted for).</p>

<p>The aircraft used a British Airways flight number between London and Bahrain (BA300/301) and a Singapore Airlines flight number between Bahrain and Singapore (SQ300/301). Flight numbers were later changed to BA16/17 and SQ16/17.</p>

<h3 id="13-who-flew-on-concorde">Who flew on Concorde?</h3>



<p>A <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19800701-1.2.69" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survey</a> conduced in 1980 revealed that 17% of Concorde’s passengers on the SIN-BAH-LHR route were Singapore residents, 20% were from Australia or New Zealand and the largest group, 38%, were British residents.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, 77% were travelling for business purposes, with only 18% using the service to take a holiday.</p>



<p>42% of passengers on the route were connecting to another city after arriving in either London or Singapore.</p>



<p>On 24th April 1980, Princess Margaret, younger sister of Britain’s then-Queen Elizabeth II, <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19800425-1.2.2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrived in Singapore on the joint BA-SIA Concorde</a> service for an official visit. The trip also included the Philippines and Malaysia, with the princess then returning to London on Concorde from Singapore on 8th May 1980.</p>



<h3 id="14-which-crew">Which crew?</h3>



<p>The SIA Concorde was flown exclusively by British Airways pilots and flight engineers. London-based pilots flew the London – Bahrain – London flights, while the airline had a detachment of Singapore-based pilots who flew most of the Singapore – Bahrain – Singapore legs.</p>



<p>In both cases the pilots spent one or two-night rest periods in Bahrain while away from base.</p>



<p><span><strong>Fun fact: </strong>When the joint venture was originally agreed, the plan included some Singapore Airlines pilots going to London <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19771029-1.2.20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for Concorde training</a>, to operate half of the flights, however this did not materialise.</span></p><p>For the cabin crew it was a different matter, with the flights shared between Singapore Airlines and British Airways. The two sets of flight attendants (SQ and BA) would not mix on any single flight, instead alternating on consecutive sectors.</p>



<p>You could therefore have an all-Singapore Airlines crew from Singapore to Bahrain, followed by an all-British Airways crew from Bahrain to Singapore, or vice-versa.</p>



<p>Three flight crew (two pilots and a flight engineer) and four cabin crew operated each Concorde flight.</p>



<h3 id="15-onboard-experience">Onboard experience</h3>



<p>Concorde was a small plane with only 100 seats in a 2-2 configuration. It also had a low ceiling and tiny passenger windows by today’s standards, about the size of an adult hand.</p>



<p>Without the space of large wide-body jets like the Boeing 747, there was certainly no room for large seats or flat beds!</p>






<p>Instead the aircraft’s short flight time on its designed routes like London to New York meant a seat more akin to Premium Economy Class today, with the focus on speed and the distraction of fine dining to pass the little time passengers spent on board.</p>

<p>Indeed Concorde passengers were always generously fed and watered on any journey. Menus included vintage Champagnes like Dom Ruinart 1973 and Mumm Cordon Rouge 1975, cocktails, fine wines, caviar and lobster canapés, plus a selection of opulent main dishes.</p>

<p>The certificate would typically be handwritten and include the signatures of the Captain and other crew members.</p>



<p>With short flight times, Concorde was never fitted with a video in-flight entertainment system. Instead only radio programming was available.</p>

<h3 id="19-further-sia-services-were-planned">Further SIA services were planned</h3>



<p>With the reinstatement of SIA’s London route on Concorde in January 1979, the airline was <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19790125-1.2.101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talking up</a> future routes for the type, once they had data on how well it operated to and from London.</p>



<p>The Financial Times reported that <em>“from Singapore, the possibilities for route expansion are considerable, including flights to such points as Hong Kong, Manila, Seoul [and] Japanese destinations”</em>.</p>



<p>Linking Singapore to Hong Kong with Concorde would have taken only <strong>90 minutes</strong>, while Singapore to Tokyo on the supersonic jet would have cut the flight time from 7 hours to just <strong>3 hours</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="20-singapore-bank-notes">Singapore bank notes</h3>



<p>Having Concorde in the Singapore Airlines livery was a huge marketing point for a young, independent Singapore, and in 1979 the ‘Bird series’ of bank notes included the aircraft on the back of the $20 version.</p>

<p>The Concorde also featured on a stamp commemorating Paya Lebar Airport after commercial flights had transferred across to Changi.</p>

<h3 id="21-first-year-review">First year review</h3>



<p>By January 1980, a year after regular Concorde services between London and Singapore had restarted, British Airways was <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19800208-1.2.31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expecting a loss</a> of between S$14 million and S$18.5 million on the route for the January 1979 to March 1980 period, with forecasts of a similar deficit in the subsequent year.</p>



<p>At the time, BA was coming under increasing pressure from the new British government to turn a profit, with the state reducing its stake in the carrier.</p>






<p>BA executives were also said to be unhappy with the cost sharing formula they had with Singapore Airlines for the services. Despite SIA and BA sharing operating costs for the flights, including for fuel and crew, a “slide-over fee” had been agreed from the outset to account for SIA’s forecast loss of First Class traffic on its own flights.</p>



<p>This was said to be costing BA S$4.9 million a year, which the British carrier felt was unjustified given SIA’s recorded increase in First Class passenger numbers to and from London.</p>



<p>BA was also <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19800208-1.2.31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said to be unhappy</a> with SIA’s lacklustre promotional efforts for the Concorde service, claiming it provided twice as many passengers for the Concorde flights as SIA, despite a 50-50 capacity share.</p>



<p>Despite the issues, SIA and BA <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19800213-1.2.51" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached an agreement</a> to continue the services, though the “slide-over fee” from BA to subsidise SIA for its loss of First Class subsonic traffic was not reduced.</p>



<h3 id="22-incidents">Incidents</h3>



<p>Despite the SIA Concorde service only operating for a couple of years, there were a few ‘minor incidents’ along the way!</p>


<ul id="ub_styled_list-b8467ba7-9d5e-4279-948d-1ff8305d6302"><p>
<li id="ub-styled-list-item-2a2c69a6-762b-4871-a974-eeb5b2230e4a">On <strong>1st February 1979</strong> the regular London – Singapore Concorde flight was <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19790202-1.2.21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to divert</a> to Kuala Lumpur, when a Singapore Airlines training aircraft burst a tyre and blocked the runway at Paya Lebar. It was only the sixth Concorde service since flights had been reinstated the previous month.</li>

<li id="ub-styled-list-item-78e9d34c-2da9-407d-aea7-64e7f98316e8">On <strong>31st May 1980</strong>, a Concorde flight departing from Paya Lebar on its way to Bahrain and London <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19800613-1.2.7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blew the roof off</a> a family home. Singapore Airlines refused to pay for the damage – claiming British Airways was responsible. BA did not admit liability, but paid the family S$500 (around S$1,100 in today’s money) <em>“to help them out”</em>.</li>

<li id="ub-styled-list-item-0b64aede-1fd9-47b4-a1d7-8a9c8ab484f3">On <strong>21st July 1980</strong>, a British businessman <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19800724-1.2.20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was stabbed in the head</a> by another passenger on a joint BA-SIA Concorde flight from London to Singapore. The SIA cabin crew and other passengers restrained the woman, who had been behaving eccentrically and did not know the man. <em>“I still don’t know why she attacked me, I never saw her before in my life”</em>, the man said.</li>

<li id="ub-styled-list-item-aaf4b143-7ecc-4ba5-8462-62c325b65863">On <strong>22nd July 1980</strong>, the same Concorde flight with the stabbed man(!) <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19800724-1.2.20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit a flock of birds</a> on its approach to Paya Lebar Airport, which were ingested by two of the four engines. Though the passengers on board were unaware, one of the engines was extensively damaged. A replacement had to be flown out from London, delaying the return service <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19800725-1.2.64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for 30 hours</a>.</li>
</p></ul>


<h3 id="23-the-end-of-concorde-singapore-flights">The end of Concorde Singapore flights</h3>



<p>Despite an earlier agreement to continue the Concorde service, by August 1980 it became clear that not all was well.</p>



<p>There were reports of <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19800802-1.2.11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only 50% load factors</a> on flights from Singapore, down from 57% the previous year, amid signs the novelty of the service was wearing off.</p>



<p>There were also complaints from passengers about the discomfort of the cabin compared to First Class seats on wide-body jets, with Concorde’s small seats and a much louder environment being far from ideal on a nine-hour trip.</p>



<p>Singapore Airlines and British Airways held further talks, amid rumours of the service now running at a <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/newnation19800813-1.2.48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S$20 million annual loss</a> (equivalent to around S$42 million today), with rising fuel prices adding to the impact.</p>



<p>On 16th September 1980 is was announced that Concorde services to and from Singapore <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19800916-1.2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would be suspended</a>, effective from 1st November 1980.</p>

<p>The final BA/SIA jointly operated Concorde service departed from Singapore on 30th October 1980. British Airways later flew all Concorde spare parts and equipment back to London.</p>



<p>Though no regular Concorde flights then served the Lion City, a BA charter flight from London to Singapore via Bahrain and Colombo did operate in March 1985.</p>



<p>French President Francois Mitterrand also passed through in September 1986, on his way back to Paris from a state visit in Indonesia, in an Air France Concorde.</p>



<p><strong>These marked the types’s only two visits to Changi Airport, which replaced Paya Lebar as Singapore’s main passenger hub in 1981.</strong></p>



<h3 id="24-what-happened-to-g-boad">What happened to G-BOAD?</h3>



<p>After returning from Singapore for the last time on 30th October 1980, G-BOAD had its Singapore Airlines titles removed and was returned to a full British Airways livery.</p>



<p>The aircraft went on to complete its service with BA, mostly to and from New York which became the airline’s ‘cash cow’ route for the type.</p>






<p>Here are some key facts about G-BOAD:</p>

<p>Even if the other exhibits aren’t of interest, you can get up close and personal with G-BOAD, the very Concorde used by Singapore Airlines between 1977 and 1980.</p>

<p>Sadly it’s still in British Airways livery on both sides (SIA would probably have had to <strong>pay</strong> this time for the advertising!).</p>



<p>We were lucky enough to visit during our round-the-world trip in 2018 and it’s well worth a look.</p>

<p>The striking features are the aircraft’s small external size (10% shorter than an A350-900) and very narrow cabin (at 2.62m wide, about the same as an ATR turboprop and less than half that of a Boeing 777).</p>

<p>For the AvGeeks, the flight deck is also pretty cool – a far cry from the two-crew, highly digitised cockpits of today.</p>

<h3 id="26-the-concorde-room">The Concorde Room</h3>



<p>Though it’s no longer possible to fly on Concorde, the name is still used by British Airways for its most exclusive First Class lounges in London and New York. In times gone by, these lounges were reserved exclusively for Concorde passengers, with boarding directly from the lounge itself.</p>



<p>We passed through the London Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 facility in 2018 before flying First Class on BA to Washington, and wrote <a href="https://mainlymiles.com/2019/01/12/review-british-airways-concorde-room-london-heathrow/">a full review</a> of the experience.</p>






<p>The business centre in the lounge even features some of the old seats from BA’s Concordes.</p>

<p>For a while the First Class section of <a href="https://mainlymiles.com/2020/02/21/review-british-airways-singapore-lounge-and-the-bar-singapore/">the British Airways Singapore Lounge</a> was called ‘The Concorde Bar’, however it has since been renamed ‘The Bar Singapore’.</p>



<div id="27-summary"><h3>Summary</h3></div>



<p>As if a joint venture between Singapore Airlines and British Airways doesn’t sound fraught enough, the introduction of Concorde service in a co-operation between the two carriers became quickly mired in political disputes.</p>



<p>These arose from either chess games over air traffic rights, or nationalistic jealousies, though both were commonplace in the late 1970s.</p>



<p>By the time the service truly came to life in 1979 and 1980, jet fuel costs had soared and longer routings owing to continued overflight issues with India were continuing to make the service less and less likely to turn a long-term profit.</p>

<p>Sadly the last regular flight Concorde left Singapore in October 1980, closing a short but fascinating chapter in Singapore Airlines history.</p>



<p>Concorde later went on to become profitable on the North Atlantic between London and New York, with many passengers willing to endure the aircraft’s drawbacks for the short flight time on this lucrative city pair.</p>



<p><strong>Singapore Airlines, meanwhile, can claim to be <meta charset="utf-8">one of only three airlines in the world to have its livery adorn this rare aircraft.</strong></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>In a <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/the-winner-takes-it-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous edition of this magazine</a>, we argued that English was so pervasive in our industry, nobody even questioned its use anymore. The same can be said of <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git</a>. It is difficult to imagine that merely twenty years ago, the landscape of source control tools was more diverse, and the choice of one such tool was much more complicated than today. Actually, Git was not even on the map yet. Before debating whether the hegemony of Git is good or bad, let us go back in time for a little while.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volver_(song)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most famous tangos</a> of all time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Gardel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlos Gardel</a> famously sings</p>
<blockquote><p>To feel… that life is a breath of fresh air,<br>
that twenty years is nothing,<br>
that, feverish, the gaze<br>
wandering in the shadows<br>
seeks and names you.</p></blockquote>

<p>The second edition of “Code Complete” by <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/steve-mcconnell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve McConnell</a> was published in 2004. On page 668 of this massive 900-page volume, we find the <em>only</em> reference to the subject of source control in the whole book: about three quarters of a page long. Nothing else. ChatGPT can easily summarize all of it with one phrase: “Version control software is good and brings several big benefits.” Not a lot to phone home about. We are really far from GitOps at this point.</p>
<p>That same year, almost exactly 20 years ago at the time of the publication of this article, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Subversion 1.0</a> saw the light of day. What was Subversion? Probably the shortest lived idea-with-good-intentions in the history of computing. See, Subversion (or <code>svn</code>) was supposed to be a better CVS (no, not the <a href="https://www.cvs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pharmacy</a>, but this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other thing</a>). “Better than CVS” meant, back in those days, to be transactional (<a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/issue-61-databases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">databases</a>, anyone?) and to have a somewhat better support for branches. We did not have higher ambitions back then, kids.</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds, however, did have higher ambitions. In 2004, the Linux kernel developers got in an increasingly strong disagreement over the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BitKeeper</a>, the proprietary, distributed version control system used to manage the kernel source code. So, what is a developer to do? Well, Linus has a tradition of writing the software everybody needs and nobody wants to start. He also has a tradition of <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/git" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naming things after himself</a>. Legend says that the first version of Git was <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/git-origin-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written in a couple of weeks</a>.</p>
<h2>CVS</h2>
<p>Never heard of CVS? It was a source control system that Joel Spolsky described in September 2000 as <em>fine</em> (emphasis his) in the first item of his eponymous <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joel Test</a> for better software:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve used commercial source control packages, and I’ve used CVS, which is free, and let me tell you, CVS is <i>fine</i>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the first step for better software was (shocker!) using source control software. (As a side note, I started my professional career as a software developer in 1997, and nope, we did not use source control, not even CVS. Yes, you guessed right: we just saved VBScript files locally and uploaded them via FTP. Too bad if we overwrote changes with one another: you only live once. I had to wait until 2002 to use a source control system for the first time, and for the curious among you, it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ClearCase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rational ClearCase</a>.)</p>
<p>Never heard of Joel Spolsky? Well, he was the co-creator of Stack Overflow, which I guess you <em>have</em> used at some point in your career. 24 years ago, Joel was one of the first influencers of the burgeoning field of software engineering. Think Kelsey Hightower, but with more controversial views. Or Steve Yegge, but with less controversial views.</p>
<p>Speaking about Stack Overflow, here is an example of the state-of-the-art of source control in 2008. One of the first-ever questions asked on the site, dated September 8th, 2008, asks precisely <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49601/is-there-a-barebones-windows-version-control-system-thats-suitable-for-only-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what version control system to use</a> for a single-developer workflow. (Interestingly, that question was asked precisely at the same time while in the real world, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_financial_crisis#2008_(September)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2008 financial crisis</a> was breaking havoc. Our industry lives in a bubble, no doubt about that. But I am digressing, once again.)</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m trying to find a source control for my own personal use that’s as simple as possible. The main feature I need is being able to read/pull a past version of my code. I am the only developer.</p></blockquote>
<p>The replies to the question consist of a long catalog of pretty much every version control system known to mankind at that point in time.</p>
<h2>Windows’ Version Control Odyssey</h2>
<p>But let us return to the year 2000: a few days before Joel Spolsky published his Joel Test, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-lucovsky-5280034/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Lucovsky</a> gave a talk titled <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/usenix-win2000/invitedtalks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Windows: A Software-Engineering Odyssey”</a> at the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/usenix-win2000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4th USENIX Windows System Symposium</a> in Seattle, Washington. Mr. Lucovsky was a member of the original Windows NT team from 1988 to the mid-2000s. The PowerPoint slides of the talk <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/usenix-win2000/invitedtalks/lucovsky_html/Lucovsky.ppt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are still available online</a> at the time of this writing, and I seriously recommend you take a look at them.</p>
<p>Because part of the “odyssey” was, you guessed it, source control. On slide 14 you can learn that Windows NT 3.51 used an “internally developed” system… which was “on life support” by the time of Windows 2000:</p>
<blockquote><p>To keep a machine in synch was a huge chore (1 week to setup, 2 hours per-day to synchronize)</p></blockquote>
<p>Oops. Not a great way to onboard new team members. Now you know why the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agile Manifesto</a>, published in 2001, was so revolutionary. Thanks to <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raymond Chen</a>, arguably the most important lecturer of Windows history, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180122-00/?p=97855" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we learn the name</a> of said internally developed system:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the early days, Microsoft used a homemade source control system formally called Source Library Manager, but which was generally abbreviated SLM, and pronounced <i>slime</i>. It was a simple system that did not support branching.</p></blockquote>
<p>In slide 24 of Mark Lucovsky’s PowerPoint slides, we learn that Microsoft took the decision to migrate the source code of Windows 2000 to something called “Source Depot”. Raymond Chen <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180122-00/?p=97855" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agrees</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shortly after Windows 2000 shipped, the Windows source code transitioned to a source control system known as Source Depot, which was an authorized fork of Perforce.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why Perforce? The choice <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/85891" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to do</a> with the gigantic size of Microsoft Windows’ source code base:</p>
<blockquote><p>The justification is perhaps less relevant than it once was, but Perforce tends to perform better on large repositories than Subversion. This is one of the reasons Microsoft acquired a source license to Perforce to build Source Depot; NT’s repository is a monster, and not many products, commercial or otherwise, could handle it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark Lucovsky’s summarized the benefits of Source Depot in two bullet points on slide 24 of his presentation:</p>
<blockquote><p>• New machine setup 3 hours vs. 1 week<br>
• Normal sync 5 minutes vs. 2 hours</p></blockquote>
<p>Is the Microsoft Windows team still using Source Depot today? Apparently not. In 2017, we learned that Microsoft migrated all 300 GB of Windows source code to Git <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an article on Ars Technica</a>, which contains another gem describing the “Microsoft odyssey” in source control systems:</p>
<blockquote><p>Long ago, the company had a thing called SourceSafe, which was reputationally the moral equivalent to tossing all your precious source code in a trash can and then setting it on fire thanks to the system’s propensity to corrupt its database.</p></blockquote>
<p>(I can confirm. Sadly, I should say.)</p>
<p>Microsoft’s adoption of Git, however, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/90-of-windows-devs-now-using-git-creating-1760-windows-builds-per-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was not without hurdles</a>, and led to the creation of the Git Virtual File System (GVFS) project:</p>
<blockquote><p>But Git isn’t designed to handle 300GB repositories made up of 3.5 million files. Microsoft had to embark on a project to customize Git to enable it to handle the company’s scale.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Age Of Git</h2>
<p>The infatuation of Microsoft with Git reached its peak in 2018, when <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it swallowed GitHub</a>, the platform that arguably made Git mainstream. Three years prior, sensing <em>l’air du</em> temps, they had released <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Studio Code</a>, with integrated Git support.</p>
<p>GitHub introduced the concept of Pull Requests to the world <a href="https://github.blog/2008-02-23-oh-yeah-there-s-pull-requests-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as early as February 2008</a>, a feature later adopted and adapted by <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://docs.gitea.com/next/usage/pull-request" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gitea</a> (and its recent fork <a href="https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/pull-requests-and-git-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forgejo</a>), and <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/tutorial-learn-about-bitbucket-pull-requests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BitBucket</a>, and which became the bread-and-butter for code reviews during the past 15 years. But the matter of fact is that GitHub also created a paradox in the world of Git: suddenly, a distributed source control system… became centralized. Some are understandably <a href="https://blog.edwardloveall.com/lets-make-sure-github-doesnt-become-the-only-option" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aghast</a> by this state of things.</p>
<p>We are in 2024, and Git is everywhere. The long evolution that led to the Git supremacy in the 2010s and, apparently, also the 2020s, can be summarized as a sequence of open-source programs, one replacing the other: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCCS</a> in the 1970s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RCS</a> in the 1980s, CVS in the 1990s, and Subversion in the 2000s. To ensure smooth migration paths, Subversion could import CVS repositories, and Git can import Subversion repositories. But most importantly, version control systems migrated from local-only systems like SCCS and RCS, to client-server architectures (CVS and Subversion), to distributed systems, like Git and others, most notably <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercurial</a>.</p>
<p>(Speaking about Mercurial, did you know that the Firefox developers recently <a href="https://glandium.org/blog/?p=4346" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to drop it</a> and use Git instead?)</p>
<p>These days, we are used to <em>cloning</em> an entire project on our computer, after which we can safely plug it off the network and continue writing software in a completely disconnected way. This simple paradigm was utterly and completely unthinkable 20 years ago. And guess what: your local repository also contains the full history of every single change ever made to your project. This was a feature that, naturally, client-server systems could never provide (spoiler alert: the server had the full history, while clients had only the <code>HEAD</code>, so to speak).</p>
<p>Git (and its cheap branching facilities) had a lasting impact on developer workflows. Vincent Driessen published in January 2010 a seminal article titled <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“A successful Git branching model”</a> introducing the world to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111007075151/http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversial</a> concept of git-flow. Why controversial? Well, because most opinions in the software industry are such. Now there is a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub flow</a> and an <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlassian Gitflow workflow</a> and many more branching workflows available.</p>
<p>Git repositories have become eventful, with every push, merge, or tag operation triggering a workflow somewhere. A whole industry has sprung up, including names such as <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/cd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Argo CD</a>, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Actions</a>, <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitLab CI/CD pipelines</a>, and <a href="https://about.gitea.com/products/runner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gitea Runner</a>, providing a new level of automation and convenience. The influence of Git is so strong in this space that the term <a href="https://www.gitops.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitOps</a> now refers to a whole subset of our industry. But you should not be using branches for deployments, <a href="https://codefresh.io/blog/stop-using-branches-deploying-different-gitops-environments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you have been warned</a>.</p>
<p>The question is simple now: what comes after Git? At this point, it is probably impossible to challenge the immense popularity of Git. I say “<em>probably</em>” because in our industry, it is impossible to predict the future. There are two interesting contenders worthy of mention: <a title="https://pijul.org/" href="https://pijul.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-from-md="">Pijul</a>, written in Rust (although the project <a title="https://github.com/8l/pijul" href="https://github.com/8l/pijul" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-from-md="">started with OCaml</a> a decade ago) or <a title="https://fossil-scm.org/" href="https://fossil-scm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-from-md="">Fossil</a>, written by the creators of SQLite. In this last case, the SQLite team provides <a href="https://sqlite.org/whynotgit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a list of reasons</a> why not to use Git:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let’s be real. Few people dispute that Git provides a suboptimal user experience. A lot of the underlying implementation shows through into the user interface. The interface is so bad that there is even a parody site that generates <a href="https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fake git man pages</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>On February 14, 2024, the Court of Appeal of Paris issued an order stating that <a href="https://www.orange.com/en">Orange</a>, a major French telecom provider, had infringed the copyight of Entr’Ouvert’s Lasso software and violated the GPL, ordering Orange to pay €500,000 in compensatory damages and €150,000 for moral damages. </p>



<p>This case has been ongoing for many years. </p>



<p>Entr’ouvert is the publisher of <a href="https://lasso.entrouvert.org/">Lasso</a>, a reference library for the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol, an open standard for identity providers to authenticate users and pass authentication tokens to online services. This is the open protocol that enables single sign-on (SSO). The Lasso product is <a href="https://lasso.entrouvert.org/">dual licensed by Entr’Ouvert under GPL or commercial licenses</a>.</p>



<p>In 2005, Orange won a contract with the French Agency for the Development of Electronic Administration to develop parts of the <a href="http://service-public.fr/">service-public.fr</a> portal, which allows users to interact online with the government for administrative procedures. Orange used the Lasso software in the solution, but did not pass on the rights to its modifications free of charge under GPL, or make the source code to its modifications available.</p>



<p>Entr’Ouvert <a href="https://www.entrouvert.com/actualites/2019/entrouvert-versus-orange/">sued Orange</a> in 2010, and the case wended its way through the courts, turning on, among other things, issues of proof of Entr’Ouvert ‘s copyright interest in the software, and whether the case properly sounded in breach of contract or copyright infringement.</p>



<p>On March 19, 2021, the Appeals Court first rejected Entr’Ouvert’s claims for copyright infringement, saying that the case was a breach of contract claim. The Court of Cassation, which is the supreme court of France, reviewed the case and issued an order on October 5, 2022 overturning the decision of the Court of Appeal. The case was then remanded to the Court of Appeal, which issued its order this week.</p>



<p>The compensatory damages were based on both lost profits of the plaintiff and disgorgement of profits of Orange. Moral damages compensate the plaintiff for harm to reputation or other non-monetary injury.<br></p>



<p><em>Note: I patched this information together from various articles, mostly read in translation. The dates in the lawsuit process were inconsistent in those sources. If I find any errors, I will update this post.</em></p>



<p><em>Update 2/22/24: <a href="https://www.courdecassation.fr/decision/65cdbcdf2425a70008258563">Here</a> is the decision in French.</em></p>

research arm </a><span>of Herman Miller, whose office chairs you can still buy. His story has been told in many places, including the </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304885404579549800874319342" rel="">Wall Street Journal</a><span> (look on archive.ph if you get paywalled on that link).</span></p><p><span>Propst actually invented cubicles to get </span><em>away</em><span> from the open office plans of the day:</span></p><blockquote><p>The offices Propst so loathed were largely open, of the type we now see on "Mad Men": row after orthogonal row of serried desks, where accountants or typists clacked away from 9 to 5, often surrounded by a corridor of closed-door offices for managers and executives.</p></blockquote><p><span>(I can’t help thinking of </span><em><a href="https://genius.com/Gilbert-and-sullivan-a-wandring-minstrel-i-lyrics" rel="">A Wand’ring Minstrel, I</a></em><span> (from </span><em>The Mikado</em><span>) when I hear the word “serried.”)</span></p><p><span>His concept was the “Action Office.” The history.com </span><a href="https://www.history.com/news/why-the-inventor-of-the-cubicle-came-to-despise-his-own-creation" rel="">article</a><span> says</span></p><blockquote><p>There had to be a better way. For Propst, the answer was in the “Action Office,” an office layout that relied on lightweight sitting and standing desks and filing systems. Acoustical panels helped insulate workers from the noise of telephone calls and typing.</p><p>But American offices didn’t exactly take to the new Action Office plan. The components were more geared to individual workers than to large companies that needed to accommodate large numbers of people, and they were hard to put together. And the concept of a completely customizable workspace didn’t sit well with executives who didn’t value the individuality of their workers. Instead, they often purchased the furniture for their own homes rather than placing them in offices. Action Office was beloved by designers—and dismissed by just about everyone else.</p></blockquote><p>This is hilarious if you think about it: the Action Office furniture was too nice to waste on ordinary peons, so the executives took it home instead.</p><p>Propst reworked his design, and Action Office II was the result. It was a smash hit.</p><blockquote><p>Faced with the failure of his first concept, Propst went back to the drawing board and created the Action Office II. The new design took his acoustical panel concept to the next level. The panels became miniature walls of multiple heights that separated each space into its own office without completely cutting a worker off from colleagues. Lightweight and easier to assemble, it made more sense to executives.</p><p>But companies didn’t use the Action Office II, and the many knockoffs it inspired, the way Propst intended. Instead of going for roomy desk spaces with different designs and walls of different heights, they opted for tiny, boxed-in desks instead. They ignored Propst’s vision of a flexible workspace and visual sightlines. Using Propst’s brainchild, cubicles were used to cram even more workers into offices. The office he had invented shrank and shrank until it became impersonal and crowded. The age of the cubicle farm had begun.</p></blockquote><p><span>Propst had an </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_3_nm_4_q_oppenheimer" rel="">Oppenheimer</a><span> moment when he saw what his invention had turned into (this is the WSJ article again):</span></p><blockquote><p>The real problem isn't the furniture; it is how the furniture represents the arbitrariness of power in the workplace. "The dark side of this is that not all organizations are intelligent and progressive," Propst said two years before he died. "Lots are run by crass people who can take the same kind of equipment and create hellholes. They make little bitty cubicles and stuff people in them. Barren, rathole places…I never had any illusions that this was a perfect world."</p></blockquote><p><span>In 1985, I had a half hour private interview with Eric Schmidt at Sun Microsystems (yes, </span><em>that</em><span> Eric Schmidt). Sun had mostly private offices, maybe shared, and “cubes vs. offices” was a hot topic even then.</span></p><p>I didn’t end up going to work at Sun (I should have, but didn’t), but the one thing I still remember from that interview was that he said (a paraphrase, not an exact quote):</p><blockquote><p>If you look at the total costs of private offices versus cubes, they come out about the same, and economics tells you that they have to. It’s just like owning versus leasing works out to be the same, because the market forces it to.</p></blockquote><p>I also worked at Google in the same building as Eric for a while, and I recalled this event for him. He smiled and said (again, this is a paraphrase):</p><blockquote><p>The one big thing I forgot about that was the value of the employee communications you get with cubes.</p></blockquote><p><span>So that’s the conventional management story in a nutshell: </span><em>We need those random encounters that you get with openness! People in private offices don’t talk to each other.</em></p><p>I’ve heard that argument over and over. It’s even employed to justify getting rid of the cubicle walls and making everything open (like the photo at the top of this article).</p><p><span>It’s utter bullshit and executive fantasy. If you walked around Google and their open offices, almost half the workers are wearing headphones to screen out the noise. Do you just yell over and </span><em>communicate</em><span> with people, like in the executives’ fantasy? No, first you have to wave your hand in front of their face to get their attention.</span></p><p><span>This CNBC </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/15/58-of-high-performance-employees-say-they-need-more-quiet-work-spaces.html" rel="">article</a><span> lays it out:</span></p><blockquote><p>In open environments, executives imagine social collaboration and surreal collision between disparate disciplines. Executives wish for the the next magical idea born from the random chaos of the corporate universe. To executives, easy access means easy sharing and easy success; we should always be able to yell at our coworkers within 25 feet whenever the mood strikes.</p></blockquote><p>At Google (actually, the years when I did work near Eric’s office), the best and most fun working environments I ever had were in shared offices, with walls and a door and a window. Even with three other people in there, it was still better than being out in the open.</p><blockquote><p>Two of my officemates in one of those ended up marrying each other! I didn’t even know anything was going on, which tells you something about their discretion, or maybe my obliviousness.</p></blockquote><p>My personal space allotment got steadily worse at Google. You can’t really blame REWS (Real Estate and Workplace Services) for that; they were forced to cram more and more people into a physical space that expanded very little. At the end, there weren’t even cubicle walls. There was literally nothing that separated my desk from the ones on each side. I hated it.</p><p>I put this question to the Internet Old Farts group on Facebook, which is, as you might guess, mostly older engineers who worked with the Internet when it was new. Many have actually experienced both the old style (private offices around the outside, cubicles in the middle) and the newer open offices. Most younger people have never had a private office.</p><p>In less than a day, it got 103 comments and 37 Likes.

computers. Apparently they still managed to communicate enough to get their work done.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tom Galloway</strong><span>: IMO, the best layout I ever saw was the old Tech Square MIT AI Lab (*not* the current Geahy monstrosity). Full offices all around the perimeters of the floors; grad students got tiny ones that two would barely fit in (but which had full walls and doors), faculty and research staff got larger solo ones. The key point though was at both ends of the floors were wide open areas, usually called a "Play-something"; playground, playroom, etc. Key aspects were a giant full wall whiteboard, couches and comfy chairs, the location of the floor water and coffee services, where tech reports were, coffee tables with a mix of research publications, newspapers, magazines, comic books, and other light reading, maybe some toys. If you wanted privacy and focus, you went to your office and shut the door. If you wanted to work but were open to interruption, you went to your office and left the door open. If you just wanted to hang out, collaborate, read in the open, etc., you went to a playroom.</span></p></blockquote><p>I replied:</p><blockquote><p>Smokey Wallace, our VP at Oracle (who came from Xerox and DEC) had the same idea: a common area for socializing, plus private offices for solo work.</p></blockquote><p>(Smokey is RIP. May his memory be a blessing.)</p><p>In Smokey’s group, there was a very large common area, with giant whiteboards, sofas, and other amenities that made it a great place to hang out.</p><p>Other answers:</p><blockquote><p>(name redacted) I worked for Smokey at DECWSL in the late 80s. We were lucky to have an office building layout (two different buildings, actually) with lots of windows and offices around the perimeter. Pretty much everyone got a private hardwall office. Some people ended up without a window. Summer interns got their own cube somewhere in the open area. A few contractors ended up sharing offices.</p><p>During my time at PARC CSL (early 90s), things were pretty much the same; researchers got a private office, mostly with windows, or at worst with a window in sight across the hall. Interns and staff were in cubes.</p></blockquote><p>more from that same person:</p><blockquote><p>When I worked at P&amp;G in the late 70s, I was pretty junior, and either had a hard wall office with window shared with another engineer (that was common; managers got a private office), or my own cube in a cube farm (where there were no hardwall offices) depending on the building.</p></blockquote><p>someone else:</p><blockquote><p>This layout is called "caves and commons". It is also used at Xerox PARC. See Chapter 10 in How Buildings Learn by Stewart Brand for more details.</p></blockquote><p>and someone else:</p><blockquote><p>I remember the first time I saw the layout at 666 Technology Pentagram, including the funny first floor (all that wood panelling...) I thought "this is how it should be" - and every time I started a company I considered that layout as something to be built - with the lego lounge and other things in the middle as shared space, and huge white board walls all over the place. wherever possible, hardwall offices for people - I trust them not to "goof off" and I want them to be able to have the right place for that serious concentration that serious work needs.</p><p>the rationale that I keep hearing for open office plans always sounds contrived at best, and some sort of strange torture ritual at worst.</p></blockquote><p>So there you have it: the best office. layout was discovered over 30 years ago, and it’s not cubicles or “open plan.” The conclusion was:</p><blockquote><p>why it's almost as if it's good for people to have choices!</p></blockquote><p><span>Many “knowledge workers” (who can work from home, as the pandemic showed) have an extreme need for personal space. All that “communication” in the open office is actually </span><em>counter-productive</em><span> for them. As the person below says: there are also smells, noise, and unfriendly temperatures to annoy him.</span></p><p>This person, who’ll remain anonymous, sent me a lengthy message, which I’ll excerpt here:</p><blockquote><p>I worked for mostly Universities and private tech companies. Both groups of organizations were absolutely terrible at directing and motivating talent. Working in a noisy, crowded open space was a huge part of that.</p><p>First of all, I hate office spaces. Poorly designed, lots of noise-reflecting surfaces, people always around creating distractions, a complete nightmare for people who have to use their brains. (Also, I acknowledge that I'm a bit sensitive to environmental things while others seem less bothered).</p><p>I'm also very cold-sensitive and found that most offices I was forced to attend had the A/C temp set to about 60 degrees, effectively turning the work environment into a meat freezer.</p><p>Anyway, a few times in my career I actually had my own private office with a door and I loved it. I believe I was spectacularly productive and focused, cuz I could close my  door and read/write/concentrate for hours. Even if these were not my favorite jobs, they wound up being my favorite work environments.</p><p>Then I had many jobs where I was just on some noisy floor that resembled the stock market idiocy from the 1980's. Just phones ringing, people talking, clickety keyboards, and endless rude behavior from people who could "Just walk up to you and interrupt". I hated it and still do.</p><p>Once COVID hit and I could see our offices closing, I moved 800 miles away and began full-time telecommute. Some might say it is lonely or "disconnected" but it has been a boon and major improvement in my life. I have no need to hear chit-chat about others outside lives all day and then struggle to find a few quiet minutes to actually get work done. I can manage my own time, come &amp; go as I please, as long as I get my work done satisfactorily. This is how I think this work should be done. (At least, if you want high quality work).</p><p>I abhor corporate real estate and those who own it. The only reason we have this insane push to get back into offices is because Company Owner's Rich Buddies are crying all the time about their crappy investments and begging CEOs the force us all back into the office.</p><p>I'd choose unemployment, homelessness, or death before going back into an office to work 40+ hours per week. It simply isn't worth it, and it drives my personal performance directly into a ditch.</p><p>All the "Collaboration happens when we're all in the office" is just Business School BS designed to guilt employees back into a life of abject misery. Yeah, I need a 2+ hour commute and stress, plus constant interruption to be "collaborative". Total BS.</p><p>So, I know some others might enjoy an open workspace, or talking with coworkers, but honestly those were the absolute worst parts of my entire career. Always made me wish I worked on a farm or was out digging ditches somewhere. If you know of any $250K/year jobs digging ditches or working on farms, then please let me know.</p><p>I haven't even touched on the jealousy and vindictiveness of hundreds of co-workers, who saw me as a threat and did everything in their power to get me fired or make me look bad. So far, I'm only talking about terrible fluorescent lighting, endless noise that doesn't help concentration, freezing cold air temps designed to store meat long-term, and the general "Forget about getting any work done today" nonsense that is open work environments.</p><p>I had dozens of terrible interactions with other employees, who tried their damndest to make my life miserable. I have ZERO of that with telecommute. Nobody wants to create drama and fight over IM/chat sessions, at least not nearly to the degree of competitiveness and vindictiveness I've seen in office work spaces.</p><p>Once I suffered thru being a Security contractor for the EPA, and their solution for the 8 of us in a Security Operations Center was to cram us all into a closet. I'm not even kidding. It was a 12' by 15' space and we crammed 7 desks in there (one staff was a night guy) and all had to sweat all over each other and breath the same stinky air for months. I finally quit and told them where to shove that job.</p></blockquote><h5>Addendum</h5><p>There are so many responses on the Facebook group that I’m going to have to publish the rest in a followup to this. Those people deserve to be heard, too.</p><p>“Follow the money” is always good practice if you’re diagnosing a business condition, along with “follow the current fad.” Take the rental for a square foot of office space, multiply that by the number of square feet each employee occupies, and you get a big cost. A private office with 80 or 100 square feet costs much more than the space for a desk, chair, and a filing cabinet. In theory, at least, cubicle walls are also simpler to reconfigure than hard office walls.</p><p><em>Although</em><span>: Eric’s “equal costs” argument above is not the only place I’ve heard that. A former Taligent employee on Facebook said:</span></p><blockquote><p>At Taligent, the company was building out a new building. Four facilities people ran the numbers. Private offices were no more expensive than cubeville.</p></blockquote><p><span>I don’t claim any expertise on office costs. Maybe open offices </span><em>are</em><span> cheaper. But consider this: if employees hate them and resist coming in and occupying them, don’t you have to factor that into your cost calculations?</span></p><p>I won’t do a lengthy disquisition on personality types, but there’s a lot of scholarly literature on the subject:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Baruch-Keren/publication/263596981_MBTI_Personality_Types_of_Project_Managers_and_Their_Success_A_Field_Survey/links/59dcede8a6fdcc2d9ed30e2f/MBTI-Personality-Types-of-Project-Managers-and-Their-Success-A-Field-Survey.pdf" rel="">MBTI Personality Types of Project: Managers and Their Success: A Field Surve</a><span>y talks about the </span><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types" rel="">Myers- Briggs Type Indicator</a><span> (MBTI), and so does this:</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170830060321id_/https://sharepoint.louisville.edu/sites/sphis/tlr/Shared%20Documents/Personality%20Type%20Team%20Performance.pdf" rel="">The effect of personality type on team performance</a><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p>The general bias (and of course I’m revealing my own bias here) is: managers and leaders are extroverts and communicators. This is considered Good by them.</p><p>The people I quote above would probably qualify as Introverts, mostly. This is considered Bad. </p><p><span>Extroverts</span><em> always</em><span> think, “We need more </span><em>communication</em><span>! These introverts who don’t like it need to be dragged out into the open where we can get at them!” I think literally every employee meeting I ever had to go to, where people were asked what they wanted, “more </span><em>communication</em><span>” was always top of the list. What they really mean is, “I want to know what’s going on without having to expend any effort!” </span></p><p><span>“</span><em>Communication</em><span>” (meaning: what’s going on in the company and in your department) is something you do for yourself by walking around and chatting; it’s not something the management or the office layout does automatically.</span></p><p>A big part of the resistance to Return-To-Office is people saying, “You know what? We hate that!”</p><p><span>We started this by noting that employees are rebelling against Return To Office. Of course, management </span><em>can</em><span> always just say, “Too bad. You do like getting paid, right?” Many hard-line companies are doing exactly that.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, office rental costs are </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/empty-spaces-and-hybrid-places-chapter-2" rel="">going down</a><span>. A McKinsey </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/empty-spaces-and-hybrid-places-chapter-2" rel="">report</a><span> says</span></p><blockquote><p>In most superstar cities, lower office attendance has similarly driven down asking rents in real terms.1 Rents in the US cities we studied fell especially sharply—for example, by 28 percent in San Francisco and by 18 percent in New York City from 2019 to 2022. Rents in the European cities we studied have been more resilient. In Paris, London, and Munich, they fell by 10 percent, 12 percent, and 9 percent, respectively. In only two of the cities we studied, Munich and Tokyo, did rents actually increase; they grew the most in Tokyo, increasing by 4 percent from 2019 to 2022.</p><p>Occupancy and rents may fall further still. Because their employees are coming to the office less often, many employers have downsized spaces to reduce costs. </p></blockquote><p><span>The Commercial Edge site has similar </span><a href="https://www.commercialedge.com/blog/national-office-report/" rel="">news</a><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p>The average U.S. office listing rate stood at $37.35 per square foot, falling 1.8% year-over-year</p></li><li><p>Up 130 basis points year-over-year, the national vacancy rate was 18% in January&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Tech and media companies are also laying off workers, which further reduces costs. So what, exactly, prevents an enlightened company from using some of those cost savings to create a genuinely better environment for their workers?</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

"Torusphere Accelerator", the animation that motivated this article.

</p>
<p>What happens if you take motion blur past its logical extreme? Here are some fun observations and ideas I encountered while trying to answer this question, with an attempt to apply the results in a procedural animation.</p>
<h2>What is motion blur supposed to look like?</h2>
<p>Motion blur started out purely as a film artifact, the result of a subject moving while the camera's shutter is open. This artifact turned out to be desirable, especially for videos, because it improves the perceptual similarity between a video and a natural scene, something I'll dive into in this section.</p>
<p>In a 3D and animation context, it's interesting to note that those two goals - looking natural, and simulating a camera, might not be in agreement, and might result in different motion blurs. I'll keep the simulation aspect as a side note, and ask what the most natural possible motion blur should look like. This can be broken down into a few questions:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>How do we perceive a natural moving scene?</li>
<li>How do we perceive this scene reproduced in a video?</li>
<li>What is the perceptual difference between those two cases?</li>
<li>How can video motion blur minimize this difference?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Perception of motion in a natural scene</h3>
<p>For the purpose of crafting motion blur, we can start by analyzing the very first steps of human vision, where the light hits our retina and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_phototransduction">phototransduction</a> takes place. Under well-lit conditions, this is handled by cone-type cells. Phototransduction is not immediate, and we can model this lag by smoothing out the light stimulus over time.</p>


<div>

<p><strong>1. Example of temporal integration in goldfish cones</strong>, taken directly from <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001210">Howlett et al. (2017)</a>. Raw stimulus is the number of photons entering the photoreceptor, in this case, a realistic example. The weighting function is derived from the cone's response in different conditions, and can be used to simulate the cone's average temporal integration. The resulting "effective stimulus", while not a measurable response, is a successful first step in modeling the cone's actual photocurrent response.

</p>
<p>Combining the above weighting function's shape with known human cone response times, we can create a detailed simulation of a <em>perceived image</em> based on any input scene. This concept has been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26357212/">used before</a>, but without the shape of the time response.</p>

<p><strong>2. Motion Smearing</strong>. Left: Example scene, assumed to be natural and continuous. Right: simulated perceived image. This assumes the viewer is looking at a fixed point, and not tracking the object with their eyes.
</p>
<p>What this shows is that there already exists a natural blur at the photoreceptor level, a phenomenon often called motion smear. So why do we add artificial motion blur in videos, and what is the link between motion smear and motion blur?</p>
<h3>Perception of a scene on a screen</h3>
<p>Let's see what this perceived image looks like when viewing a screen with limited frames per second.</p>

	</p>
	
</div>

	
<p><strong>3. Perception of a video</strong>. Left: Example scene as it would appear on a screen. Right: perceived image.
</p>
<p>This finally gives us a way of visualizing the usefulness of motion blur. When viewing a video without motion blur, the resulting perceived image looks like overlaid frames instead of the expected motion smear. This situation is improved with a motion blurred video, where each frame no longer shows a moment in time, but an average of all the moments within the time interval covered by this frame. This is analogous to a video made with a camera whose shutter is open for the duration of each frame's timespan. The resulting perceived image looks a lot more similar to the natural case.</p>
<h3>Making the screen natural with a shutter function</h3>
<p>Something still looks off in the perceived image for traditional motion blur. At some object speeds, artifacts still appear as discontinuities in the motion smear. This can be almost eliminated by applying a shutter function: instead of averaging all the moments within a frame, we weight them by a function so that the start and end moments have less weight than the central moment of a frame. The name "shutter function" comes from the analogy to shutter efficiency in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragm_%28optics%29">diaphragm camera</a>, where the shutter takes time to transition between open and closed states. But instead of simulating cameras, the shutter function can be chosen in a way that minimizes the perceptual difference between the screen and a natural scene. The problem then becomes very similar to crafting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function">window functions</a> in signal processing, and indeed the most popular window functions give very good results.</p>

<p><strong>4. Applying a shutter function</strong>.

</p>
<p>How well does this work? You can get a rough idea in the following demo, which can be switched between motion blur with and without a shutter function. My impression is that the shutter function is not necessary at low speeds, but is noticeably more natural for fast-moving objects<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. This makes it highly relevant to the "past the logical extreme" experiment I'm aiming for. It also looks smoother in still frames, which is incidental but sometimes relevant.</p>

	</p>
	
</div>

	
<p><strong>5. Live comparison</strong> of motion blur with and without a shutter function.
</p>
<p>I'll emphasize that this perceptual approach to motion blur is not conventional and could be misguided in some way. The common approach is to simulate cameras, which results in zero time overlap between frames, and often entirely discards moments that fall between frames. Meanwhile, the method I'm describing results in overlapping time-ranges for successive frames. With that out of the way, let's try applying this technique.</p>
<h2>Getting irrational with the torusphere</h2>
<p>To make things both difficult and interesting, I decided to make this infinite motion blur animation as a realtime <a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/01/">shader</a>. Because I like hardship and misery, yes, but mostly because I'd like the end product to be interactive, and in this case, a shader might be the simplest way.</p>
<p>First, how does one render motion blur in realtime? After ruling out multisampling<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> and analytic ray-traced motion blur<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, I settled on a terrible hack best described as "integrated volume motion blur". Represent the moving object as a function that takes coordinates (including time) and returns density (the inside is 1, the rest is 0). Integrate this density function over time, and the result should give you a "motion-blurred density" over any time interval. The result can be rendered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_ray_casting">volume ray casting</a>. This method is not photorealistic, but can handle extremely long trails with realtime performance.</p>
<p>The intended animation combines an <strong>orbiting sphere</strong> and a <strong>rotating torus</strong>, both of which need to be motion-blurred up to essentially infinite speed.</p>
<h3>Motion-blurred sphere</h3>
<p>Taking a 2D slice of the orbiting sphere, the problem is reduced to finding the motion-blurred density for an orbiting circle. Let's assume an orbital radius $R$, and a circle of radius $a$. The circle's center is always at a distance of $R$ from the origin, so it can start at the point $(R, 0)$. This means that initially, all points $(x, y)$ on the circle are defined by:</p>
<p>$$
(x - R)^2 + y^2 = a^2
$$</p>
<p>In order to work with the orbit, this should be expressed in polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$, which can be done by substitution:</p>
<p>$$
r^2 - 2 r R \cos\theta + R^2 = a^2
$$</p>
<p>Finding the density function means taking any point, and answering the question: When does this point enter the orbiting circle? When does it exit? The answer lies in the angle coordinate coordinate $\theta$ of the initial object's surface, with the same radial coordinate $r$ as the given point. Because the object is orbiting, this angle is directly related to the time when the object will hit the point. So let's find $\theta$ based on the above definition of the surface:</p>
<p>$$
\theta = \pm\arccos\frac{R^2 + r^2 - a^2}{2 r R}, \theta\in[-\pi,\pi]
$$</p>
<p>The $\pm$ sign comes from the inversion of $\cos$. This $\pm$ is useful, since it determines which half-circle is defined: <span color="green">positive</span> or <span color="red">negative</span> $\theta$. The two halves can be combined to get a polar expression of the density $\rho$ of the corresponding disk:</p>
<p>$$
\rho(r,\theta) = 
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if }-h(r)\lt\theta\lt h(r) \cr
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\\[2ex]
\text{where}\ \ h(r) = \arccos\frac{R^2 + r^2 - a^2}{2 r R}
$$</p>
<p><img alt="disk density from two half-circles" src="https://www.osar.fr/notes/motionblur/half_circles.svg"></p>
<p>From this starting position, the disk is orbiting around the origin. This is equivalent to removing the time $t$ times the speed $v$ from the angle coordinate:</p>
<p>$$
\rho(\colorbox{yellow}{t,}r,\theta) = 
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if }-h(r)\lt\theta\colorbox{yellow}{- v t}\lt h(r) \cr
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$</p>
<p>We can separate $t$ from the time interval $I$ during which the object is present at a point $(r,\theta)$:</p>
<p>$$
\rho(t, r,\theta) = 
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if }t\in I \cr
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\\[2ex]
I=\left[\cfrac{\theta-h(r)}{v}, \cfrac{\theta+h(r)}{v}\right]
$$</p>
<p>The motion-blurred density is the integral of the density $\rho$ over the current frame's time interval $F$. This works out to be the length of the intersection between $I$ and $F$. This can also be described intuitively: we're measuring how much of the frame's time is occupied by the object at a given point in space.</p>
<p>$$\int_F\rho(t,r,\theta) d t = \int_{F\cap I}1\ d t = |F\cap I|$$</p>
<p>Let's apply a shutter function $s$. For simplicity, assume $s$ is already centered on the current frame's time span. We can apply it by multiplying the density with $s(t)$ before integrating, replacing the need for any bounds of integration of the density. If $s$ has an antiderivative $S$, then the motion-blurred density becomes:</p>
<p>$$
\int\rho(t,r,\theta) s(t) d t =
\int_I s(t) d t = 
S(\max I)-S(\min I)
$$</p>
<p>This can be implemented in a shader and works with any shutter function, however, based on the goals from the first part of this article, shutter functions should have an integral of 1 and should overlap in such a way that the sum of all shutter functions at any timepoint is always 1. This can be satisfied with a trapezoid function, or with a sinusoid function such as this one, used in the animation:</p>
<p>$$
s(t)=\begin{cases}
\cfrac{1-\cos\frac{(t-A)2\pi}{B-A}}{B-A} &amp; \text{if }A\lt t\lt B \cr
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\\[2ex]
A=\min F-\frac{|F|}{2},B=\max F+\frac{|F|}{2}
$$</p>
<h3>Motion-blurred torus</h3>
<p>The same process can be followed for the torus. A 2D vertical slice of a torus is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiric_section">spiric section</a>, or Spiric of Perseus. Aside from sounding like an <strong>epic videogame weapon</strong>, it also has a convenient formulation in polar coordinates. Take a torus of minor radius $a$ and major radius $b$. Take a section at position $c$, and within this section in polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$, all torus points are defined by:</p>
<p>$$
(r^2-a^2+b^2+c^2)^2 = 4b^2(r^2\cos^2\theta+c^2)
$$</p>
<p>Solving for $\theta$, assuming $\theta\in[-\pi/2,\pi/2]$, this becomes:</p>
<p>$$
\theta = \pm\arccos\frac{\sqrt{(a^2 - b^2 - c^2 - r^2 - 2 b c) (a^2 - b^2 - c^2 - r^2 + 2 b c)}}{2 b r}
$$</p>
<p>Once again, the inside of the torus is enclosed between the positive and negative cases of the $\pm$ sign, giving us a polar expression of the density of the solid torus. The remaining steps to get the motion-blurred rotating torus are exactly the same as for the sphere above.</p>

<p><strong>6. Motion-blurred spiric section</strong>.
</p>
<h3>Putting it together</h3>
<p>All that's left is to "draw the rest of the owl" by combining elements in a convincing way, and by using standard volume ray casting on the result. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_%28geometry%29">Surface normals</a> need extra care because there's no such thing as "motion-blurred surface normals", so they're just blended together here.</p>
<p>The animation should run below with basic mouse/touch interaction. It might not work well on all devices, so there's also a pre-rendered video at the top of the page. You can also find <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/cdXSRn">this shader on Shadertoy</a>.</p>

<p>In the realm of computing pioneers,&nbsp;Dame Stephanie “Steve” Shirley is one of the most celebrated, not only for building a $3 billion tech empire in 1960s England, but for doing it with an all-female, work-from-home staff of professionally qualified women who had left the work force after marrying and having children.</p>
<p>Having hit the glass ceiling herself many times, Shirley set out to establish her own software enterprise for women, built by women. She and her employees pioneered the idea of women going back into the work force after a career break, and promoted flexible work methods, job sharing, profit-sharing, and company co-ownership.</p>
<p>Born Vera&nbsp;Buchthal in 1933 in Dortmund, Germany, she fled Nazi Europe through the&nbsp;Kindertransport rescue effort orchestrated before the start of WWII.</p>
<p>She lived with foster parents in Sutton Coldfield, England, and attended&nbsp;Oswestry Girls’ High School. Unfortunately, her school did not teach mathematics, so she took classes at the local boys’ school.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://ieeecompsac.computer.org/2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Attend COMPSAC, the IEEE Computer Society’s signature Conference on Computers, Software and Applications.</strong></a></span></p>
<p>Later in life, she founded a work-from-home contract programming company in 1962 exclusively for women called “Freelance Programmers” that eventually employed over 8,500 people. The company grew rapidly and went public in 1996. Ultimately,&nbsp;her company was valued at $3 billion, making millionaires of 70 of her team members.</p>

<p>Shirley’s company was responsible for programming the black box for the supersonic Concorde. She and her employees were also instrumental in helping develop software standards, management control protocols, and other standards that were eventually adopted by NATO.</p>
<p>But building a huge corporation in post-war Britain came with its own unique challenges.&nbsp;<a href="http://mariehicks.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marie Hicks</a>, professor of history at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Wisconsin at Madison</a>, interviewed Shirley for a 2018 article on behalf of the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer History Museum</a>. She explored Shirley’s early life, influences, flair for math, business acumen, and ambition.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/an/2018/01/man2018010006.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shorter version of the interview</a>, edited by&nbsp;Dag Spicer of the Computer History Museum, appears in the <em>IEEE Annals of the History of Computing.&nbsp;</em>The original transcript with Hicks’ full interview may be accessed <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102738707" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Here are some of the more thought-provoking quotes from that interview: How she started a company for women, how she escaped the Nazis, how she got her first job, how she began her career, how she soldiered through discrimination, and how she donated a fortune to autism research while raising an autistic son.</p>

<h2>How&nbsp;Dame Stephanie Shirley started a company just for women</h2>
<figure id="attachment_445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-445"><img decoding="async" src="http://publications.computer.org/annals/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2018/08/photo18-300x200.jpg" alt="Dame Stephanie Shirley and Queen Elizabeth" width="300" height="200"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-445"><em>Dame Stephanie Shirley with Queen Elizabeth.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>“My business was very special. It was a woman’s company in the computer industry; 297 of the first 300 staff were all women.</p>
<p>“It was really a female-friendly organization. It was set up as a crusade rather than to make money, and indeed it took a long time before it did make any money, and I was very proud eventually when it succeeded that I’d set up this special women’s company. Again, another first, I thought, because I have to justify my existence.”</p>
<h2>On escaping the Nazis</h2>
<p>“It is as strong today as it was 75 years ago, when, as a traumatized, weeping five-year-old, I was put on a train and sent to a strange country with strange languages, strange people, strange parents, strange food. It would’ve been disastrous, I think, had I not been with my older sister, a nine-year-old who was really not ready yet to care for a younger sibling,” Shirley said.</p>
<p>“But what that two-and-a-half-day transition between Vienna and the Liverpool Street Station in London did for me was it made me able to cope with change, and I think that’s relevant to my technical career.”</p>

<h2>On forging her career</h2>
<p>“A lodger that my mother had knew somebody who knew somebody who worked at the Post Office Research Station, and I had a similar introduction to another corporation and had interviews at both.</p>
<p>“The first one, General Electric Company, was fine and so on, but they were not terribly interested in me, in my future, in my continuing training and education, and so although they offered me a job, I went with the Post Office because they clearly were interested in ongoing education.”</p>

<p>“I had already launched my own business when I began to become professional. Not just relying on introductions but actually going out and marketing and getting new business, and in a very naive way I was writing literally dozens of letters, introducing my company’s services, and getting absolutely no reply whatsoever.</p>
<p>“It was my dear husband of now 50 years who actually suggested, ‘Well, perhaps it’s the name.’ I was writing with this double feminine, Stephanie Shirley, Shirley being my marital name. He asked, ‘Why don’t you use the family nickname of Steve?’ so I wrote exactly the same letters as Steve Shirley, and I began to get some replies.”</p>

<h2>On employing gays and lesbians</h2>
<p>“When the company was small, we knew a lot about each other’s families. I knew which child had gotten measles. When it came to gay and lesbian people, we might’ve guessed. It probably wouldn’t have been something that we talked about. It wasn’t relevant to our mobility, which was something that we were always very interested in. It’s clear that we did attract many lesbian staff; we employed thousands of people over the years, of course.”</p>
<h2>On how the private sector gave women more opportunities</h2>
<p>“Nobody could say I couldn’t do this if the rule book said that I could. In my generation of women, there were many things you couldn’t do. One college that I attended part-time didn’t have washroom facilities for women.</p>
<figure id="attachment_455" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-455"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="http://publications.computer.org/annals/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2018/09/erniedamesteveshirley-230x300.jpg" alt="Shirley with ERNIE" width="250" height="326"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-455"><em>Shirley was one of two non-engineers who worked on ERNIE, a new breed of random-number machine.

<p>“My job actually would’ve entailed me going onto a cable laying ship [a&nbsp;deep-sea&nbsp;vessel&nbsp;designed to lay&nbsp;underwater cables&nbsp;for telecommunications or electric power transmission] and I couldn’t do that. Women just did not go on working ships. I couldn’t work on the stock exchange.</p>
<p>“I could write software for the London Stock Exchange, but I couldn’t actually work there myself. Couldn’t drive a bus, couldn’t fly an airplane. These were legislative things, and the public sector was very firm on things like that….”</p>
<h2>Shirley’s life after retirement</h2>
<p>Since retiring, Shirley has spent her time supporting various IT-related causes and, most recently, organizations researching and providing services to those with autism.</p>
<p>Her interest in autism has personal roots.</p>
<p>“I’ve moved to a certain extent away from computing and become really a manager, a businesswoman, and later with the need to care for my learning disabled, autistic son, into really a career, and then a philanthropist. That’s now what I do. I try to give money away in a wise way,” says Shirley.</p>
<h2>On what she chose as her philanthropy</h2>
<p>“Autism is a strange disorder. It’s known to be genetic, but we don’t really know very much about it. What we do know is that it’s difficult to deal with, and difficult for the people with autism.</p>
<figure id="attachment_456" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-456"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="http://publications.computer.org/annals/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2018/09/photo11-300x300.jpg" alt="shirley and giles" width="300" height="300"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-456"><em>Stephanie Shirley and her only son, Giles. She became a philanthropist for autism because he was diagnosed with the condition. (Photo credit: steveshirley.com)</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I’ve set up several charities in the autistic field and so my experience is through them.</p>
<p>“A child that is dashing about in all directions could today be wearing a Fitbit bracelet to see what’s going on there. They could well be monitored how they’re sleeping, when they’re sleeping and so on. They could be using fingerprints as access keys, because child protection is very important with these very, very vulnerable pupils. Many of them are using iPads to communicate.</p>
<p>“Back in 1982—I remember the year because it was the International Year of Disabled People—I was starting to talk about using computers as a communication aid, as distinct from process control or calculations, to help the blind to see, the deaf to hear. Communication is vitally important for people with autism, so there’s a whole host of things.”</p>
<h2>Shirley’s short film in a Google series on the early days of computing</h2>
<p>Produced by Google as part of a series of short films highlighting women’s involvement in the early days of computing, “Freelance Programmer: the story of Dame Stephanie Shirley” features Shirley’s inspirational story in her own words.

                      <p>We all have pet peeves, even though&nbsp;there’s a lot going on in the world that makes them&nbsp;pretty insignificant. While acknowledging that there are many more important things in life, I write this post about my own personal illustration pet peeve in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, it’ll make a little teeny difference. Here goes:</p>
<p>I love butterflies. They’re one of my favorite subjects to illustrate and one of my favorite sights in nature. To me, they’re a symbol of hope, an embodiment of beauty, and a sign of what’s right in the world. I think that’s why it bothers me when&nbsp;depictions of butterflies often fail to&nbsp;do them justice, whether they are&nbsp;in a work of art, a website, a product, an animation, or in print.</p>
<p>My explanation needs to begin with a description of&nbsp;a dead&nbsp;butterfly. When a butterfly is placed in an insect collection, the person who prepares it positions its wings&nbsp;according to a convention that facilitates identification. In the photo of a dead, pinned butterfly&nbsp;below, note&nbsp;that the trailing edge of the forewings (blue line) is perpendicular to the body’s axis (red line). When the insect has just been killed, it remains flexible for awhile, allowing the collector&nbsp;time&nbsp;to insert a pin and manipulate its wings into this position, where they are held in place until they become dry and stiff.&nbsp;This is an unnatural position for the wings;&nbsp;it’s a pose that may be possible&nbsp;for the insect to assume in life, but not a position that most species typically assume.</p>

<p>In field guides&nbsp;and other butterfly reference materials, one frequently sees images of such pinned butterflies&nbsp;because, I presume, it is easy to photograph a dead butterfly. Also,&nbsp;numerous photos of dead butterflies against the same background is aesthetically consistent, and the pinned&nbsp;position allows the viewer to see as much of the hind wings as possible, aiding&nbsp;identification. It is a useful convention and it makes sense&nbsp;in&nbsp;field guides.</p>
<p>By contrast, butterflies that are alive and going about their business of flying and nectaring do not typically hold their forewings too far forward of their head.&nbsp;In life, the way a butterfly holds its&nbsp;wings is variable, but it is uncommon for most species that I’ve encountered to hold their forewings in the manner of pinned specimen. Here are some photographs I’ve taken over the years that demonstrate this:</p>

<p>As you can see, in most cases, it is the <em>leading</em> edge of the forewings that is nearly perpendicular to the body. One will notice quite a bit of variability in wing positions in living butterflies, but it’s atypical&nbsp;for the trailing edge of the forewings to be perpendicular to the body. This is true not only of butterflies that are perched, but also of butterflies aloft. As an example, view this<a href="http://www.gettyimages.ca/license/138307199" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;photo of monarchs in flight</a>. There are exceptions, of course. It seems that some of the smaller butterflies may exhibit wing positions fairly close to that of a dead, pinned specimen:</p>
<div id="attachment_2809"><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2809" src="https://www.emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Damstra-Pearl_crescent.jpg" alt="Damstra Pearl crescent" width="500" height="333" title="Please, enough with the dead butterflies! 4" srcset="https://www.emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Damstra-Pearl_crescent.jpg 500w, https://www.emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Damstra-Pearl_crescent-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Damstra-Pearl_crescent-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Damstra-Pearl_crescent-360x240.jpg 360w, https://www.emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Damstra-Pearl_crescent-305x203.jpg 305w, https://www.emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Damstra-Pearl_crescent-395x263.jpg 395w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2809">Pearl crescent photo © Emily S.

<p>I suspect that the&nbsp;field guide&nbsp;photos of dead, pinned butterflies are the ultimate (though unwitting)&nbsp;source of&nbsp;my pet peeve: The pervasive phenomenon of butterflies in popular culture being shown as dead, with the trailing edge of their forewings perpendicular to their body. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>You can see <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/eoskins/9975461605" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at this link</a> that the practice of illustrating dead butterflies goes back a long way, in a painting by a 19th century artist.</p>
<p>A particularly ironic&nbsp;example is <a href="https://www.scarce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Flight-of-butterflies-film-poster.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this movie poster</a> for a documentary about the flight of monarchs. Some of the flying monarch&nbsp;illustrations&nbsp;are accurate, but the largest and many&nbsp;of the others are clearly dead, even though they’re depicted as if in flight.</p>
<p>Stock photography sites include misleading photos of dead butterflies&nbsp;purporting to be in flight. Here’s<a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/ca/photo/monarch-butterflies-in-various-flying-positions-isolated-on-white-gm185302115-19288861?st=_p_monarch%20butterfly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> one</a>. Here’s <a href="https://www.dreamstime.com/stock-photo-monarch-butterfly-flying-beautiful-isolated-white-background-image46588423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another</a>. It’s understandable that customers&nbsp;would accept the description as accurate, even though it isn’t.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.askideas.com/50-amazing-3d-butterfly-tattoos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This website </a>shows numerous&nbsp;butterfly tattoos.&nbsp;Only a few look alive, despite the tattoo artists’ clever&nbsp;technique&nbsp;of inking&nbsp;cast shadows to give the impression that the butterflies are actually perched on the skin. Had the recipients of dead butterfly tattoos known the difference between a living and a dead butterfly, I have to believe they would&nbsp;have more carefully considered their options. I think a depiction of a living butterfly is the most effective way&nbsp;to convey its positive symbolism.</p>
<p>Dead butterflies are frequently spotted in gift shops. You can rest your head against them, adorn your ears with them, hang them on your wall, enoy&nbsp;them while you sip a beverage, wrap your gifts with them, or wear them:</p>

<p>I have blurred a couple company names in the photos above because I’m not trying to shame anyone. Most people have seen and are influenced by&nbsp;thousands (millions?) of depictions of unintentionally dead butterflies and have never considered&nbsp;the difference between a living and a dead butterfly. That’s why I decided to write this post.</p>
<p>I’m not innocent of committing my own pet peeve.&nbsp;In 2001, I illustrated the endangered Karner Blue butterfly using pinned specimens&nbsp;as a reference:</p>

<p>Had I realized&nbsp;then what I know now, I would have changed the wing and leg positions to be more lifelike. It would have made for a better representation, even though I&nbsp;was not attempting to show the insects in flight or perched on a flower. Nowadays, if you ask me to illustrate a butterfly, I will position its wings&nbsp;as if it is&nbsp;alive:</p>

<p>I realize there are some instances where it isn’t clear that the artist/designer intended to show a living butterfly, and where it may be perfectly acceptable to represent a dead butterfly. Nonetheless, there’s no good reason to depict a dead butterfly in the vast majority of situations. It doesn’t take much effort to be accurate about wing position. My hope is that the multitudes of butterfly images in our culture will gradually shift toward alive, which is how I prefer to think of&nbsp;them, and how I think these beautiful insects should be seen.</p>
<p>If you hadn’t previously noted the difference between a living and a dead butterfly, I’m afraid&nbsp;you will now begin to see dead butterflies EVERYWHERE, as I do.</p>

<p><span face="arial" size="5" color="#008000">using a solar oven as a <i>
radiant refrigerator</i> at night</span></p>
<p><a href="http://solarcooking.org/images/more/radiantfridge1.jpg">
<img src="http://solarcooking.org/images/more/thumbnails/radiantfridge1_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/more/radiantfridge1.jpg" width="100" height="88"></a>my first experiments were during a winter in 1997 in kalgoorlie, an inland 
location of western australia: the ambient nighttime minimum was getting down to 
2-3 degrees above zero (celsius).</p>
<p>using a box-cooker with a black base, i poured about half a centimeter deep 
of water into the bottom of the cooker and put it outside at night. the glass 
lid had to be removed as glass is opaque to infrared and would inhibit the 
cooling. i put the cooker (<i>uncooker</i>?) in a location where it saw a 
maximum amount of sky and no trees or buildings (on the roof of my house). </p>
<p>the sky needed to be clear all night, with still air. i was using rainwater 
as the town water contained additives which may have lowered the freezing point. 
i would set the alarm clock for about 5am, get out of bed and climb onto the 
roof in the near dark (unfun) and remove a solid disk of ice from the now <i>
uncooker</i> (much fun). i got ice consistently over several nights, even though 
there was no frost on the ground, and pots of water sitting next to the box 
cooker did not freeze.</p>
<p>i tried the same experiment again this past summer using a smaller box-cooker 
in a different location (bridgetown, wa). it was difficult to get a sight away 
from trees. i was unable to make ice, and the water was only getting about 4 
degrees celsius below ambient. however, when my gas fridge died a few years ago 
i built a radiant fridge which works well: i got a dead fridge from the tip and 
lay it on its back (like a chest freezer) on the south side of my shed (for 
daytime shade). i super-insulated it with layers of aluminum foil and straw, 
held together with some iron sheeting held in place with star pickets driven 
into the ground (a very rough bush job) after sundown i leave the lid open. the 
inside of the lid is reflective so that when it is lifted at night and rests on 
my shed wall it lets the fridge 'see' more sky, rather than the warm shed. </p>
<p>when i get up in the morning i close the lid to keep the cool in during the 
day. i have kept a log of the temperatures down there, but i'm writing from 
perth so don't have them with me. but typically during summer the ambient 
temperature would be in the low 30's and my fridge would not rise above 16 
degrees. it gets a degree or two below ambient during clear nights, on cloudy 
nights it stays a little above ambient (due to thermal inertia), on rainy nights 
my food gets wet. i have been using this arrangement for a few years for keeping 
provisions fresh and beer cool and am quite happy with it.</p>
<p>i can see as much use for radiant fridges as there is for solar cookers 
around the world and hope that other people take up on this. it uses the same 
technology and principles as solar cooking (permitting the exchange of heat by 
radiation whilst blocking the exchange by conduction) and can be made with the 
same low level of technology.</p>

      <p><span>U.S. Department of Commerce Publishes Proposed Rule Imposing “Know Your Customer” and Reporting Requirements on U.S. Infrastructure as a Service Providers</span>

    </p>
  </div><div>
  
    
      <p><span>Thursday, February 1, 2024</span>

    </p>
  </div><div><div>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (“Commerce”), Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) recently issued a <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/about-bis/newsroom/press-releases/3443-2024-01-29-bis-press-release-infrastructure-as-as-service-know-your-customer-nprm-final/file">proposed rule</a>&nbsp;aimed at preventing foreign actors from utilizing U.S. Infrastructure as a Service (“IaaS”) products (i.e., cloud computing services) to engage in malicious cyber-enabled activity, specifically by imposing certain due diligence and reporting requirements on U.S. IaaS providers and their foreign resellers. The January 29, 2024,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/01/29/2024-01580/taking-additional-steps-to-address-the-national-emergency-with-respect-to-significant-malicious">Notice of Proposed Rule Making</a>&nbsp;(“NPRM”) follows&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/25/2021-01714/taking-additional-steps-to-address-the-national-emergency-with-respect-to-significant-malicious">Executive Order ("EO") 13984</a>&nbsp;(“Taking Additional Steps To Address the National Emergency With Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber- Enabled Activities”), issued by President Trump in January 2021, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/01/2023-24283/safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence">EO 14110</a>&nbsp;(“Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence”), issued by President Biden in October 2023. BIS has invited the public to submit comments on the proposed rule by April 29, 2024.</p>
<p>The proposed rule, which would amend the Information and Communications Technology and Services (“ICTS”) regulations (15 C.F.R. Part 7), focuses on three central policy objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requiring U.S. IaaS providers and their foreign resellers to implement a Customer Identification Program (“CIP”);</li>
<li>Empowering the U.S. Department of Commerce to prohibit or restrict access to U.S. IaaS products by certain foreign persons or persons in certain foreign jurisdictions; and</li>
<li>Requiring U.S. IaaS providers and their foreign resellers to report known instances of foreign persons training large artificial intelligence models “with potential capabilities that could be used in malicious cyber-enabled activity” (e.g., social engineering attacks or denial-of-service attacks).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Customer Identification Program</strong></p>
<p>The proposed rule requires all U.S. providers of U.S. IaaS products to create, implement, and maintain an appropriately tailored, written CIP—akin to the “know your customer” (“KYC”) information that banks maintain. The primary purpose of the CIP is to verify whether potential customers and beneficial owners are foreign or U.S. persons, and to verify the identities of potential foreign customers and their beneficial owners.</p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>CIP Identification Procedures</strong></em></li>
</ol>
<p>At minimum, U.S. IaaS providers must gather and retain specific identifying information from potential foreign customers and foreign beneficial owners to verify their identity, including their:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name;</li>
<li>Address;</li>
<li>Means and source of payment;</li>
<li>Email address;</li>
<li>Telephone number; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>“IP address(es) used for access or administration and the date and time of each such access or administrative action.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to the anti-money laundering regulations administered for financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act, the BIS proposed rule defines “beneficial owner” as an individual who “exercises substantial control over a [c]ustomer or owns or controls at least 25 percent of the ownership interests of a [c]ustomer.”</p>
<p>The proposed rule seems to suggest that providers should assume all potential customers and beneficial owners are non-U.S. persons until the aforementioned identifying information is collected and assessed. If a provider verifies that “the potential customer and all beneficial owners are U.S. persons,” the provider need not engage in further verification procedures. (The proposed rule defines U.S. persons as U.S. citizens, U.S. lawful permanent residents, U.S.-incorporated entities and their foreign branches, and persons located in the United States.)</p>
<p>If, however, the provider has collected all requisite information and determined that the potential customer and beneficial owner[s] are non-U.S. persons or entities, the provider must then confirm the identity of the potential foreign customer and foreign beneficial owner through selected documentary or non-documentary identity verification procedures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the provider “doubt[s] the true identity of a potential [foreign] customer” and foreign beneficial owner—or cannot verify the identity of such—the provider must obtain further information, “including signatories, to verify the potential [foreign] customer’s [or foreign beneficial owner’s] identity.”</p>
<p>The proposed rule also requires CIPs to outline next steps if an IaaS provider cannot verify the identity of a potential foreign customer or foreign beneficial owner. At minimum, the CIP must include:</p>
<ul>
<li>“When the IaaS provider should not open an account for the potential customer;”</li>
<li>“The terms under which a customer may use an account while the IaaS provider attempts to verify the identity of a customer or beneficial owner of the account, such as restricted permission or enhanced monitoring;”</li>
<li>“When the IaaS provider should close an account or subject it to other measures, such as additional monitoring . . . after attempts to verify the identity of a customer or beneficial owner of the account have failed;” and</li>
<li>“Other measures for account management or redress for customers whose identification could not be verified or whose information may have been compromised.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, IaaS providers must retain all identifying information relied upon to verify the identity of a foreign customer or foreign beneficial owner for a period of no less than “two years after the date the IaaS account is closed or the date the account was last accessed.”</p>
<p>To facilitate comprehensive oversight, the proposed rule also requires that CIPs include certain “risk-based procedures” requiring:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Customer[s] notify the IaaS provider when the customer adds beneficial owners to its account;” and</li>
<li>“Periodic continued verification of the accuracy of the information provided [to the IaaS provider] by the customer.”</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The proposed rule requires U.S. providers to flow through the above requirements to their foreign resellers. If a provider becomes aware that its foreign resellers are not complying with the requirements of the rule, the U.S. IaaS provider must “terminate the reseller relationship within 30 calendar days” and “report the suspected or [known] malicious cyber-enabled activity discovered to relevant authorities.”</p>
<div>
<ol start="2">
<li><em><strong>CIP Reporting Requirements</strong></em></li>
</ol>
<p>The proposed rule requires&nbsp;U.S. IaaS providers and their foreign resellers&nbsp;to submit a CIP certification form to Commerce detailing, in relevant part:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;A description of the identity verification procedures used by the provider;</li>
<li>The resources used by the provider to detect malicious cyber activity;</li>
<li>The provider’s procedures for ensuring its foreign resellers maintain an appropriate CIP;</li>
<li>Contact information for the person responsible for managing the CIP;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The number and locations of IaaS customers;</li>
<li>“The number and locations of the IaaS provider’s foreign beneficial owners;”</li>
<li>“A list of all foreign resellers of IaaS products;” and</li>
<li>“The number of IaaS customer accounts held by foreign customers whose identity has not been verified.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Thereafter, U.S. IaaS providers and their related foreign resellers must submit annual CIP certifications attesting the provider has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewed its CIP in the year since its last certification;</li>
<li>Incorporated relevant updates into its CIP concerning “changes in its service offerings;”</li>
<li>Updated its CIP to incorporate changes in the cyber threat landscape;</li>
<li>Ensured its CIP is in compliance with the regulations; and</li>
<li>“Recorded the resolution of each situation in which the IaaS provider was unable to verify the identity of a customer since its last certification.”&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Providers are expected to update Commerce “outside of the normal reporting schedule . . . [if, for example,] a significant change in business operations or corporate structure has occurred or a material change to a CIP [including a change to the primary contact responsible for the CIP] has been implemented.” The reference to a change in “corporate structure” is interesting, and raises the question as to whether Commerce might expect providers to notify Commerce of an acquisition or significant investment into the company. (Commerce may clarify this point in a final rule.)</p>
<p>Further, new providers of IaaS products must submit a completed CIP certification form to Commerce prior to granting IaaS account access to any foreign customer.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><em><strong>Compliance Assessments</strong></em></li>
</ol>
<p>To guarantee compliance with the proposed rule, Commerce will review all information submitted by U.S. IaaS providers and their related foreign resellers in annual CIP certification forms. If a CIP fails to meet the requirements set forth above, Commerce may:</p>
<ol>
<li>Conduct a compliance assessment of certain IaaS providers; or</li>
<li>Audit the “provider’s CIP processes and procedures.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Following a compliance assessment or audit, Commerce may:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recommend certain remediation measures; and</li>
<li>“Review a specific transaction or a class of transactions” carried out by an identified IaaS provider.</li>
</ol>
<p>IaaS providers are expected to maintain a written copy of both their CIP and their foreign resellers’ CIPs, and “must provide any copy of these CIPs to [Commerce] within ten calendar days of a request from [Commerce].”</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><em><strong>CIP Exemptions</strong></em></li>
</ol>
<p>An IaaS provider may apply for an exemption from the CIP requirement by demonstrating that it has established an appropriate Abuse of IaaS Products Deterrence Program (“ADP”) aimed at “detect[ing], prevent[ing], and mitigat[ing] malicious cyber enabled activities.”</p>
<p>The Secretary of Commerce considers the following, “in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence,” when determining whether to issue an exemption:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether the ADP is of “an appropriate size and complexity;”</li>
<li>Whether the ADP incorporates a “robust” ability to “deter, detect, and respond to red flags;”</li>
<li>Whether the provider maintains “effective” oversight of reseller arrangements;</li>
<li>The extent to which the provider voluntarily cooperates with law enforcement; and</li>
<li>Whether the provider participates in public-private sector collaborations meant to “develop and maintain privacy-preserving data sharing and analytics to enable improved detection and mitigation of malicious cyber-enabled activities.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Once an exemption is granted, the IaaS provider and its foreign resellers must regularly update their ADP to incorporate the “changing threat landscape” and must notify the Secretary of Commerce of any “significant deviations or changes to their ADP.”</p>
<p><strong>Special Measures for Certain Foreign Jurisdictions or Foreign Persons</strong></p>
<p>The proposed rule authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to prohibit or limit, for a period of 365 days unless extended, IaaS transactions with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Certain foreign persons who have “engaged in a pattern of malicious cyber-enabled activities;” or</li>
<li>Persons located in certain foreign jurisdictions which have a “significant number of foreign persons offering . . . or directly obtaining U.S. IaaS products for use in malicious cyber-enabled activities.”</li>
</ol>
<p>If the Secretary of Commerce issues a written determination barring or limiting interactions with a certain foreign person or jurisdiction, U.S. IaaS providers must incorporate the special measures no earlier than 180 days following the determination.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Certain Large AI Model Training</strong></p>
<p>In an effort to secure the development and use of artificial intelligence (“AI”), the proposed rule requires U.S. IaaS providers and their foreign resellers to report known instances of foreign persons training “large AI models with potential capabilities that could be used in malicious cyber-enabled activity” to Commerce.</p>
<p>If a U.S. IaaS provider becomes aware of a transaction concerning a foreign person which:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Results or could result in the training of a large AI model with potential capabilities that could be used in malicious cyber-enabled activity;” or</li>
<li>“[While] the original arrangements provided for in the terms of the transaction would not result in [the aforementioned training,] a development or update in the arrangements means the transaction now does or could result in the training of a large AI model with potential capabilities that could be used in malicious cyber-enabled activity,”</li>
</ol>
<p>the provider must file a report with Commerce, including relevant information about the foreign person and training run, within 15 days of the “transaction occurring or the provider or reseller having knowledge” of the prohibited transaction. U.S. IaaS providers may refer to the examples provided in § 7.308 for additional information.</p>
<p>A U.S. provider of IaaS products may not provide products to a foreign reseller who does not comply with identified reporting requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<p>The proposed rule by Commerce reflects an effort to secure the American cyber frontier, particularly in relation to the development of artificial intelligence. The following aspects and implications of the proposed regulations are notable:</p>
<ul>
<li>The proposed rule would institute a CIP requirement for U.S. IaaS providers akin to the “know your customer” requirements applicable to banks, introducing a complex compliance protocol that will require resources and lead time.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Under the proposed framework, companies can seek an exemption from the CIP requirement by adopting an ADP and applying to Commerce for an exemption.</li>
<li>Under the proposed rule, U.S. companies newly seeking to become IaaS providers would need to adopt a CIP before starting business as a provider.</li>
<li>The proposed rule’s reporting requirements regarding foreign persons’ use of IaaS products to engage in certain AI training would impose a significant monitoring obligation on providers.</li>
<li>The proposed rule would require U.S. providers to flow the CIP and reporting requirements through to foreign resellers.</li>
<li>The stakes of noncompliance would be high, with violations punishable under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which provides for civil penalties of up to the greater of ~$368,000 per violation or twice the value of the transaction connected to the violation, or criminal penalties of up to $1 million and/or 20 years’ imprisonment.</li>
<li>Notably, Commerce is proposing to implement the rules by amending the ICTS regulations, which otherwise are focused on threats to the U.S. technology supply chain. The technology should monitor developments relating to these rules, as they likely will be an important vehicle for technology regulation in the months and years to come.</li>
<li>Commerce is also considering imposing controls on the use of U.S. export-controlled advanced computing items to provide cloud services for use in training large AI models. This is an important part of the policy conversation and should be part of the risk calculus for companies in the industry.</li>
<li>Affected or interested parties may submit comments on the proposed regulations until April 29, 2024.</li>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/#introduction"> (§)</a></h2>
<p>At work, one of the things I do pretty often is write print generators in HTML to recreate and replace forms that the company has traditionally done handwritten on paper or in Excel. This allows the company to move into new web-based tools where the form is autofilled by URL parameters from our database, while getting the same physical output everyone's familiar with.</p>
<p>This article explains some of the CSS basics that control how your webpages look when printed, and a couple of tips and tricks I've learned that might help you out.</p>

<p>Here are some sample page generators to establish some context, and perhaps a shred of credibility.</p>
<p>I'll be the first to admit these pages are a little bit ugly and could use more polish. But they get the job done and I'm still employed.</p>

<h2 id="page">@page<a href="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/#page"> (§)</a></h2>
<p>CSS has a rule called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@page"><code>@page</code></a> that informs the browser of your website's printing preferences. Normally, I use</p>
<div><pre><span>@</span><span>page</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>size</span><span>:</span> <span>Letter</span> <span>portrait</span><span>;</span>
    <span>margin</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div><p>I will explain why I choose <code>margin: 0</code> in the later section about margins. You should use Letter or A4 as appropriate for your relationship with the metric system.</p>
<p>Setting the size and margin of @page is not the same as setting the width, height, and margin of your <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. @page is beyond the DOM — it contains the DOM. On the web, your <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element is bounded by the edges of your screen, but when printing it is bounded by @page.</p>
<p>The settings controlled by @page more or less correspond to the settings you get in your browser's print dialog when you press Ctrl+P.</p>
<p>Here's a sample file I used to do some experiments:</p>
<div><pre><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>style</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>@</span><span>page</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>/* see below for each experiment */</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>html</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>%</span><span>;</span>
    <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>%</span><span>;</span>
    <span>background-color</span><span>:</span> <span>lightblue</span><span>;</span>

    <span>/* grid by shunryu111 https://stackoverflow.com/a/32861765/5430534 */</span>
    <span>background-size</span><span>:</span> <span>0.25</span><span>in</span> <span>0.25</span><span>in</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>Here's how that looks in the browser:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/sample_in_browser.png" title="but i don't want new chrome"></p>
<p>And here are the results of some different @page values:</p>
<p><code>@page { size: Letter portrait; margin: 1in; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/letter_portrait_1in.png"></p>
<p><code>@page { size: Letter landscape; margin: 1in; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/letter_landscape_in1.png"></p>
<p><code>@page { size: Letter landscape; margin: 0; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/letter_landscape_0.png"></p>
<p>Setting the @page size won't actually put that size of paper into your printer's feed tray. <a href="https://youtu.be/3z9YjGWaxC0" title="Office Space - PC Load Letter?">You'll have to do that part yourself</a>.</p>
<p>Notice how when I set <code>size</code> to A5, my printer stays on Letter, and the A5 size fits entirely within the Letter size which gives the appearance of a margin even though it's not coming from the <code>margin</code> setting.</p>
<p><code>@page { size: A5 portrait; margin: 0; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/a5_portrait_0.png"></p>
<p>But if I tell the printer that I have actual A5 paper loaded, then it looks as expected.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/a5_portrait_0_a5paper.png"></p>
<p>From what I gather by experimentation, Chrome only follows the @page rule if you have Margin set to Default. As soon as you change Margin in the print dialog, your output is instead the product of your physical paper size and the chosen margin.</p>
<p><code>@page { size: A5 portrait; margin: 0; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/a5_portrait_0_default.png"></p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/a5_portrait_0_none.png"></p>
<p>Even when you choose a @page size that fits fully within your physical paper, the <code>margin</code> still matters. Here, I make a 5x5 square with no margin, and a 5x5 square with margin. The size of the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element is bounded by the @page size <strong>and</strong> margin combined.</p>
<p><code>@page { size: 5in 5in; margin: 0; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/5in_5in_0.png"></p>
<p><code>@page { size: 5in 5in; margin: 1in; }</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/5in_5in_1in.png"></p>
<p>I did all these tests not because I expect to print on A5 or 5x5 paper, but because it took me a while to figure out what exactly @page is. Now I am pretty confident in always using Letter with margin 0.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media">media query</a> called <code>print</code> where you can write styles that only apply during printing. My generator pages often contain a header, some options, and some help text for the user that obviously shouldn't come out on the print, so this is where you add <code>display:none</code> on those elements.</p>
<div><pre><span>/* Normal styles that appear while you are preparing the document */</span>
<span>header</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>block</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>@</span><span>media</span> <span>print</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>/* Disappear when you are printing the document */</span>
    <span>header</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>none</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/mediaprint_1.png"></p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/mediaprint_2.png"></p>
<h2 id="width_height_margin_and_padding">Width, height, margin, and padding<a href="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/#width_height_margin_and_padding"> (§)</a></h2>
<p>You'll need to know a bit about the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model">box model</a> to get the margins you want without wrestling the computer too much.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/box_model.png"></a></p>
<p>The reason I always set @page <code>margin: 0</code> is that I'd rather handle the margins on the DOM elements instead. When I tried to use @page <code>margin: 0.5in</code>, I would often accidentally wind up with double-margins that squash the content smaller than I expected, and my one-page design spilled onto a second page.</p>
<p>If I wanted to use @page margin, then the actual page content would need to be laid out all the way up against the edges of the DOM, which is harder for me to think about and harder to preview before printing. It is mentally easier for me to remember that <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> occupies the entire physical paper and my margins are within the DOM instead of beyond it.</p>
<div><pre><span>@</span><span>page</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>size</span><span>:</span> <span>Letter</span> <span>portrait</span><span>;</span>
    <span>margin</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>html</span><span>,</span>
<span>body</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>8.5</span><span>in</span><span>;</span>
    <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>11</span><span>in</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div><p>When it comes to multi-page print generators, you're going to want a separate DOM element representing each page. Since you can't have multiple <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, you're going to need another element. I like <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>. Even for single-page generators, you may as well always use an article.</p>
<p>Since each <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> represents one page, I don't want any margins or padding on <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. We're pushing the logic one step further — it is easier for me to let the article occupy the entire physical page and put my margins within it.</p>
<div><pre><span>@</span><span>page</span>

</pre></div><p>When I talk about adding margin within my article, I'm not using the <code>margin</code> property, I'm using <code>padding</code>. That's because <code>margin</code> goes outside and around your element in the box model. If you use a <code>margin</code> of 0.5in, you'll have to set the article to 7.5×10 so that the article plus 2×margin equals 8.5×11. And if you want to adjust that margin you'll have to adjust the other dimensions.</p>
<p>Instead, <code>padding</code> goes on the inside of the element, so I can define the article to be 8.5×11 with 0.5in padding, and all the elements inside the article will stay on the page.</p>
<p>A lot of intuition about element dimensions is easier when you set <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing"><code>box-sizing: border-box</code></a>. It makes it so that the outer dimensions of the article are locked in while you adjust the inner padding. This is my snippet:</p>

<p>Once you've got your articles and margins set up, the space inside the article is yours to do with as you please. Design your document using whatever HTML/CSS you feel is appropriate for the project. Sometimes this means laying out elements with flex or grid because you've been given some leeway with the output. Sometimes it means creating squares of a specific size to fit on a certain brand of sticker paper. Sometimes it means absolutely positioning absolutely everything to the millimeter because the user needs to feed a special piece of pre-labeled paper through the printer to get your data on top of it, and you're not in control of that special paper.</p>
<p>I'm not here to give a tutorial on how to write HTML in general, so you'll need to be able to do that. All I can say is be mindful of that fact that you're dealing with the limited real estate of a piece of paper, unlike a browser window which can scroll and zoom to any length or scale. If your document will contain an arbitrary number of items, be ready to paginate by creating more <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>A lot of the print generators I write contain tabular data, like an invoice full of line items. If your <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> is large enough to go onto a second page, the browser will automatically duplicate the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> at the top of each page.</p>

<p>That's great if you're just printing a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> with no frills, but in a lot of real scenarios it's not that simple. The document I'm recreating often has a letterhead on the top of each page, a footer on the bottom, and other custom elements that need to be explicitly repeated on each page. If you just print a single long table across pages, you don't have much ability to place other elements above, below, and around it on intermediate pages.</p>
<p>So, I generate the pages using javascript, splitting the table into several smaller ones. The general approach here is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Treat the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> elements as disposable and be ready to regenerate them at any time from objects in memory. All user input and configuration should take place in a separate header / options box, outside of the articles.</li>
<li>Write a function called <code>new_page</code> that creates a new article element with the necessary repeating header/footer/etc.</li>
<li>Write a function called <code>render_pages</code> that creates the articles from the base data, calling <code>new_page</code> every time it fills up the previous one. I usually use <code>offsetTop</code> to see when the content is getting far along the page, though you could <strong>definitely</strong> use smarter techniques to get the perfect fit on each page.</li>
<li>Call <code>render_pages</code> whenever the base data changes.</li>

</pre></div><p>It is usually good to include a "page X of Y" counter on your pages. Since the number of pages is not known until all pages are generated, I can't do this during the for loop. I call a function like this at the end:</p>

<p>I've shown that the @page rule helps inform the browser's default print settings, but the user can override it if they want to. If you set @page to portrait mode and the user overrides it to landscape mode, your layout and pagination might look wrong, especially if you are hardcoding any page thresholds.</p>
<p>You can accommodate them by creating separate <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> elements for portrait and landscape, and using javascript to switch between them. There might be a better way to do this, but at-rules like @page behave differently than normal CSS properties so I'm not sure. You should also save some variable that can help your <code>render_pages</code> function do the right thing.</p>
<p>You could also stop hardcoding thresholds, but then I'd have to follow my own advice.</p>

</pre></div><h2 id="data_source">Data source<a href="https://voussoir.net/writing/css_for_printing/#data_source"> (§)</a></h2>
<p>There are a couple of ways to get your data onto the page. Sometimes, I pack all of the data into the URL parameters, so the javascript just does <code>const url_params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);</code> and then a bunch of <code>url_params.get("title")</code>. This has some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The page loads very fast.</li>
<li>It's easy to debug and experiment by changing the URL.</li>
<li>The generator works offline.</li>
</ul>
<p>This also has some disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The URLs become very long and unweildy, people cannot comfortably email them to each other. See sample links at the top of this article.</li>
<li>If the URL does get sent in an email, that data is "locked in", even if the source record in your database changes later.</li>
<li>Browsers do have limits on URL length. The limits are pretty high but not infinite and might vary per client.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes I instead use javascript to fetch our database records over the API, so the URL parameters just contain the record's primary key and maybe a mode setting.</p>
<p>This has some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The URLs are much shorter.</li>
<li>The data is always fresh.</li>
</ul>
<p>and disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user has to wait a second while the data is being fetched.</li>
<li>You have to write more code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes I set <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable"><code>contenteditable</code></a> on the articles so the user can make small changes before printing. I also like to use real, live checkbox inputs they can click before printing. These features add some convenience, but in most cases it would be wiser to make the user change the source record in the database first. Also, they limit your ability to treat the article elements as disposable.</p>

<p>Atom­ic physi­cist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> is famous­ly quot­ed as say­ing, “Pre­dic­tion is very dif­fi­cult, espe­cial­ly if it’s about the future.” Yet despite years of get­ting things wrong, mag­a­zines love think pieces on where we’ll be in sev­er­al decades, even cen­turies in time. It gives us com­fort to think great things await us, even though we’re long over­due for the per­son­al jet­pack and moon colonies.</p>

<p>And yet it’s Asi­mov who appar­ent­ly owned the only set of post­cards of <em><a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/france-in-the-year-2000-1899-1910/">En L’An 2000</a></em>, a set of 87 (or so) col­lectible artist cards that first appeared as inserts in cig­ar box­es in 1899, right in time for the 1900 World Exhi­bi­tion in Paris. Trans­lat­ed as “France in the 21st Cen­tu­ry,” the cards fea­ture Jean-Marc Côté and oth­er illus­tra­tors’ inter­pre­ta­tions of the way we’d be living…well, 23 years ago.</p>


<p>The his­to­ry of the card’s pro­duc­tion is very con­vo­lut­ed, with the orig­i­nal com­mis­sion­ing com­pa­ny going out of busi­ness before they could be dis­trib­uted, and whether that com­pa­ny was a toy man­u­fac­tur­er or a cig­a­rette com­pa­ny, nobody seems to know. And were the ideas giv­en to the artists, or did they come up with them on their own? We don’t know.</p>

<p>One of the first things that stands out scan­ning through these prints, now host­ed&nbsp;at <em><a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/france-in-the-year-2000-1899-1910/">The Pub­lic Domain Review</a></em>, is a com­plete absence of space trav­el, despite Jules Verne hav­ing writ­ten <em><a href="http://jv.gilead.org.il/pg/moon/">From the Earth to the Moon</a></em> in 1865 (which would influ­ence Georges Méliès’ <em><a href="http://www.openculture.com/2013/08/a-trip-to-the-moon-and-five-other-free-films-by-georges-melies-the-father-of-special-effects.html">A Voy­age to the Moon</a></em> in 1902). How­ev­er, the under­wa­ter world spawned many a flight of fan­cy, includ­ing a whale-drawn bus, a cro­quet par­ty at the bot­tom of the ocean, and large fish being raced like thor­ough­bred hors­es.</p>

<p>There are a few inven­tions we can say came true. The “Advance Sen­tinel in a Heli­copter” has been doc­u­ment­ing traf­fic and car chas­es for decades now, fed right into our tele­vi­sions. A lot of farm work is now auto­mat­ed. And “Elec­tric Scrub­bing” is now called a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLt5rBfNucc">Room­ba</a>.</p>

<p>For a card-by-card exam­i­na­tion of these future visions, one should hunt out Isaac Asimov’s 1986 <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1OvGupZ">Future­days: A Nine­teenth Cen­tu­ry Vision of the Year 2000</a></em>, which can be found on Ama­zon right now. (Or see the nice gallery of images at <em><a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/france-in-the-year-2000-1899-1910/">The Pub­lic Domain Review</a></em>.) And who knows? Maybe next year, your order will come to your door by drone. Just a pre­dic­tion.</p>
