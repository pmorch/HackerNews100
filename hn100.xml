            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mbuffett.com/posts/maintaining-motivation/">https://mbuffett.com/posts/maintaining-motivation/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40586587">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>One of the biggest sticking points of being a solo dev is maintaining motivation. I‚Äôve been keeping a journal entry about how to hack my motivation, what works and what doesn‚Äôt. Here are the things that have worked.</p><h3 id="convert-external-sources-to-motivation">Convert external sources to motivation</h3><p>I‚Äôve always known that I‚Äôm more extrinsically than intrinsically motivated, so I have a couple systems that help to give me bursts of external motivation. For example, the Money Bots, which pop up every time someone subscribes.</p><p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/motivation/money_bots.png"></p><p>I‚Äôm a push notification ascetic, but these pop up right on my home screen. It‚Äôs a small burst of motivation every time. There‚Äôs a bit of a hedonic treadmill effect; initially a single new subscriber was a massive hit of dopamine/energy, and that‚Äôs reduced over time, but they still fuel me.</p><p>In a similar vein, I signed up for a service that notifies me whenever someone mentions Chessbook. This is simultaneously useful for marketing, since engaging on socials can help a lot, but it‚Äôs also motivating whenever I see people talking (hopefully positively) about the thing I‚Äôve built.</p><p>There‚Äôs also a <code>#pump-up</code> channel with a feed of milestones we‚Äôve hit, like $X MRR, 2,000 discord users, churn rate &lt;6%, motivating stuff like that.</p><h3 id="leave-tasks-unfinished">Leave tasks unfinished</h3><p>I can‚Äôt overstate how much this one helps me. I try to leave a task 90% finished at the end of a working session. It feels slightly worse than closing out the work, but it makes starting the next day 10x easier. Having a quick win when I start coding is a massive boost, and it immediately gets me into the flow state. It can‚Äôt be <em>too</em> easy though, if all I have left is to run <code>git commit</code>, that‚Äôs not enough. Ideally it‚Äôs something where I know exactly what I need to do, that will take 5-10 minutes.</p><h3 id="use-the-thing-myself-as-much-as-possible">Use the thing myself, as much as possible</h3><p>I try to use my own product as much as I can. When someone submits a bug report about some jank, sometimes it‚Äôs easy to classify it as a small issue. Then I run into it myself, realize that it really affects the experience, and go fix it right away. Felt pain is way more salient than communicated pain.</p><p>To digress, this also gives me way better product ideas, the best ones I‚Äôve had didn‚Äôt come from sitting down and thinking about what people may want, they came from realizing what I myself want.</p><h3 id="address-the-pain-instead-of-pushing-through">Address the pain, instead of pushing through</h3><p>There‚Äôs always some parts that suck. A neglected area of the codebase, dealing with third parties, releasing new versions of native apps, etc. If I know I‚Äôll have to deal with one of these as part of a task, it can feel much harder to motivate myself to get started.</p><p>The trick, is that you can almost always make these less painful.</p><p>For example, recently I felt a lot of friction starting a new task because it needed 4+ new endpoints, and that always involved a lot of boilerplate. I have to write the types on the backend, write the same types on the frontend, make sure I get the payload correct, make sure I get the path correct, and nothing is type-checked so usually it doesn‚Äôt work the first time. So before starting, I found a RPC library called <a href="https://www.rspc.dev/">RSPC</a>, which generates types for me, and makes writing and calling a new backend function from the frontend almost as easy, and just as type-safe, as calling another async frontend function.</p><p>Not only did this remove the pain point, but I was actively excited to use this new system. I converted a source of friction into a motivation multiplier.</p><p>This is one that‚Äôs easy to forget if you‚Äôve worked in bigger companies where you can‚Äôt address the pain points of day-to-day development. You‚Äôve probably acquired a sense of futility in trying to address these things. There‚Äôs either deadlines to hit, or people to get sign-off from, or you need to write a technical doc on your approach before you get to try it. Being able to just go fix and improve whatever you want is one of the greatest points of being a solo dev, so remind yourself that you can take advantage of it at any time.</p><h3 id="do-nothing">Do nothing</h3><p>I get sucked into high-tech Skinner Boxes all the time. Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, etc. The best way I‚Äôve found to get out of this is to do it in two steps. First I go from Reddit to doing nothing, then I get to work.</p><p>Going straight from Reddit to focused work is very hard, but doing nothing is much easier, and eventually your brain calms down and it doesn‚Äôt feel nearly as hard to start writing some code.</p><p>I really mean doing nothing; I‚Äôll just sit in front of my screen for a few minutes and as if by magic, the consumption-fueled dopamine-overload fog will lift, and I can get excited about creation and problem-solving again.</p><h3 id="update-my-users">Update my users</h3><p>This is a two-for-one, I can both update my users, and motivate myself by looking back on progress. I often reach the end of the month, and find myself thinking ‚Äúdid I even get anything done?‚Äù, but then you can write your update for the month, and see that you did get a lot done.</p><p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/motivation/update.png"></p><p>Obviously this cuts both ways though, if you really didn‚Äôt get much done you‚Äôll see that too, but facing the truth that you‚Äôre not getting enough done can be motivating too.</p><h3 id="get-a-partner">Get a partner</h3><p>This may seem contradictory to the title, but I only said solo <em>dev</em>. I have a partner, who‚Äôs way better at everything product/design/copy/etc.</p><p>I won‚Äôt list all the benefits of having a partner, but I now believe they‚Äôre essential, and in any future projects I‚Äôll be making sure to find a partner that complements my skillset while being aligned on the problem. It‚Äôs a night and day difference.</p><p>The motivation piece here is mostly around accountability. It‚Äôs the same reason that people have gym partners, just having someone that expects you to show up can be powerful. Also if you have a weekly meeting and find you have nothing to talk about, you‚Äôre probably not getting enough done, and it‚Äôs a salient reminder.</p><p>The other piece is that your motivation and your partner‚Äôs motivation will ebb and flow, and it won‚Äôt happen in lock-step. It‚Äôs very helpful to have someone else still motivated about the project, when you‚Äôre not.</p><h3 id="no-zero-days-to-avoid-listless-guilt">No zero days, to avoid listless guilt</h3><p>Some days when I‚Äôm not getting anything done, I‚Äôve got this lingering guilt that I‚Äôm having a ‚Äúzero day‚Äù. This prevents me from fully enjoying whatever activity I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôve tried just giving myself permission to enjoy whatever I‚Äôm doing, but it just doesn‚Äôt work. Ostensibly I‚Äôm taking time off and recharging, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like that at all ‚Äì it feels like pushing through. This can lead to a negative feedback loop, where I‚Äôm constantly trying to recharge, but just getting more tired.</p><p>I‚Äôve found the only way is to get some good work done first, then I can be fully immersed in whatever fun slacking-off activity I dive into.</p><h3 id="if-ive-got-it-use-it">If I‚Äôve got it, use it</h3><p>Sometimes I‚Äôll be going to bed thinking about a problem, and get the motivation which comes in the moment of figuring things out. I could write it down and get to it in the morning, but most of the time I‚Äôll just get up and work until 4am instead. This is also one of the great parts of being a solo dev. I don‚Äôt need to be up at 9am to be available on Slack, so I can use my motivation whenever it strikes me, even if that‚Äôs in the middle of the night.</p><p>This probably doesn‚Äôt generalize, but again this is more of a journal entry adapted into a blog post, than it is advice. I‚Äôve always done better with the looser approach of trying to maximize the opportunities for flow state work, than forcing myself to work 9-5 every day, rain or shine.</p><h3 id="you-have-adhd-getting-yourself-to-work-shouldnt-be-this-hard">You have ADHD, getting yourself to work shouldn‚Äôt be this hard</h3><p>True üòÑ</p></div></article><div><p>Thanks for reading!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"> <header><p>5 Jun 2024</p></header> <p>Finally, conformant Vulkan for the M1! The new ‚ÄúHoneykrisp‚Äù driver is the first <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/vulkan#submission_780">conformant Vulkan¬Æ</a> for Apple hardware on any operating system, implementing the full 1.3 spec without ‚Äúportability‚Äù waivers.</p> <p>Honeykrisp is <strong>not yet released</strong> for end users. We‚Äôre continuing to add features, improve performance, and port to more hardware. <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/alyssa/mesa/-/tree/honeykrisp-20240506-2/src/asahi/vulkan?ref_type=heads">Source code</a> is available for developers.</p> <figure> <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/holocure.png"><img src="https://rosenzweig.io/holocure.avif" alt="HoloCure running on Honeykrisp ft. DXVK, FEX, and Proton."></a>  </figure> <p>Honeykrisp is not based on prior M1 Vulkan efforts, but rather <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@gfxstrand">Faith Ekstrand</a>‚Äôs open source <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/introducing-nvk.html">NVK driver</a> for NVIDIA GPUs. In her words:</p> <blockquote> <p>All Vulkan drivers in Mesa trace their lineage to the Intel Vulkan driver and started by copying+pasting from it. My hope is that NVK will eventually become the driver that everyone copies and pastes from. To that end, I‚Äôm building NVK with all the best practices we‚Äôve developed for Vulkan drivers over the last 7.5 years and trying to keep the code-base clean and well-organized.</p> </blockquote> <p>Why spend years implementing features from scratch when we can reuse NVK? There will be friction starting out, given NVIDIA‚Äôs desktop architecture differs from the M1‚Äôs mobile roots. In exchange, we get a modern driver designed for desktop games.</p> <p>We‚Äôll need to pass a half-million tests ensuring correctness, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters">submit the results</a>, and then we‚Äôll become conformant after 30 days of industry review. Starting from NVK and our OpenGL 4.6 driver‚Ä¶ can we write a driver passing the Vulkan 1.3 conformance test suite <em>faster</em> than the 30 day review period?</p> <p>It‚Äôs unprecedented‚Ä¶</p> <p>Challenge accepted.</p> <h3 id="april-2">April 2</h3> <p>It begins with a text.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Faith‚Ä¶ I think I want to write a Vulkan driver.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Her advice?</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Just start typing.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Thre‚Äôs no copy-pasting yet ‚Äì we just add M1 code to NVK and remove NVIDIA as we go. Since the kernel mediates our access to the hardware, we begin connecting ‚ÄúNVK‚Äù to <a href="https://vt.social/@lina">Asahi Lina</a>‚Äôs kernel driver using code shared with OpenGL. Then we plug in our shader compiler and hit the hay.</p> <h3 id="april-3">April 3</h3> <p>To access resources, GPUs use ‚Äúdescriptors‚Äù containing the address, format, and size of a resource. Vulkan bundles descriptors into ‚Äúsets‚Äù per the application‚Äôs ‚Äúdescriptor set layout‚Äù. When compiling shaders, the driver lowers descriptor accesses to marry the set layout with the hardware‚Äôs data structures. As our descriptors differ from NVIDIA‚Äôs, our next task is adapting NVK‚Äôs descriptor set lowering. We start with a simple but correct approach, deleting far more code than we add.</p> <h3 id="april-4">April 4</h3> <p>With working descriptors, we can compile compute shaders. Now we program the fixed-function hardware to dispatch compute. We first add bookkeeping to map Vulkan command buffers to lists of M1 ‚Äúcontrol streams‚Äù, then we generate a compute control stream. We copy that code from our OpenGL driver, translate the GL into Vulkan, and compute works.</p> <p>That‚Äôs enough to move on to ‚Äúcopies‚Äù of buffers and images. We implement Vulkan‚Äôs copies with compute shaders, internally dispatched with Vulkan commands as if we were the application. The first copy test passes.</p> <h3 id="april-5">April 5</h3> <p>Fleshing out yesterday‚Äôs code, <em>all</em> copy tests pass.</p> <h3 id="april-6">April 6</h3> <p>We‚Äôre ready to tackle graphics. The novelty is handling graphics state like depth/stencil. That‚Äôs straightforward, but there‚Äôs a <em>lot</em> of state to handle. Faith‚Äôs code collects all ‚Äúdynamic state‚Äù into a single structure, which we translate into hardware control words. As usual, we grab that translation from our OpenGL driver, blend with NVK, and move on.</p> <h3 id="april-7">April 7</h3> <p>What makes state ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù? Dynamic state can change without recompiling shaders. By contrast, static state is baked into shader binaries called ‚Äúpipelines‚Äù. If games create all their pipelines during a loading screen, there is no compiler ‚Äústutter‚Äù during gameplay. The idea hasn‚Äôt quite panned out: many game developers don‚Äôt know their state ahead-of-time so cannot create pipelines early. In response, Vulkan has <u><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state.html">made</a></u> <u><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state2.html">ever</a></u> <u><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3.html">more</a></u> <u><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_vertex_input_dynamic_state.html">state</a></u> <u><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library.html">dynamic</a></u>, punctuated with the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/you-can-use-vulkan-without-pipelines-today"><code>EXT_shader_object</code></a> extension that makes pipelines <em>optional</em>.</p> <p>We want full dynamic state and shader objects. Unfortunately, the M1 bakes random state into shaders: vertex attributes, fragment outputs, blending, even linked interpolation qualifiers. Like most of the industry in the 2010s, the M1‚Äôs designers bet on pipelines.</p> <p>Faced with this hardware, a reasonable driver developer would double-down on pipelines. DXVK would stutter, but we‚Äôd pass conformance.</p> <p>I am not reasonable.</p> <p>To eliminate stuttering in OpenGL, we make state dynamic with four strategies:</p> <ul> <li>Conditional code.</li> <li>Precompiled variants.</li> <li>Indirection.</li> <li>Prologs and epilogs.</li> </ul> <p>Wait, what-a-logs?</p> <p>AMD also bakes state into shaders‚Ä¶ with a twist. They divide the hardware binary into three parts: a <em>prolog</em>, the shader, and an <em>epilog</em>. Confining dynamic state to the periphery eliminates shader variants. They compile prologs and epilogs on the fly, but that‚Äôs fast and doesn‚Äôt stutter. Linking shader parts is a quick concatenation, or long jumps avoid linking altogether. This strategy works for the M1, too.</p> <p>For Honeykrisp, let‚Äôs follow NVK‚Äôs lead and treat <em>all</em> state as dynamic. No other Vulkan driver has implemented full dynamic state and shader objects this early on, but it avoids refactoring later. Today we add the code to build, compile, and cache prologs and epilogs.</p> <p>Putting it together, we get a (dynamic) triangle:</p> <p><a href="https://rosenzweig.io/hk-triangle.png"><img src="https://rosenzweig.io/hk-triangle.avif" alt="Classic rainbow triangle"></a></p> <h3 id="april-8">April 8</h3> <p>Guided by the list of failing tests, we wire up the little bits missed along the way, like translating border colours.</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>/* Translate an American VkBorderColor into a Canadian agx_border_colour */</span></span>
<span><span>enum</span> agx_border_colour</span>
<span>translate_border_color<span>(</span>VkBorderColor color<span>)</span></span>

<span>   <span>case</span> VK_BORDER_COLOR_INT_TRANSPARENT_BLACK<span>:</span></span>
<span>      <span>return</span> AGX_BORDER_COLOUR_TRANSPARENT_BLACK<span>;</span></span>
<span>   <span>...</span></span>
<span>   <span>}</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div> <p>Test results are getting there.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pass</strong>: 149770, <strong>Fail</strong>: 7741, <strong>Crash</strong>: 2396</p> </blockquote> <p>That‚Äôs good enough for <a href="https://github.com/Novum/vkQuake">vkQuake</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://rosenzweig.io/vkquake.png"><img src="https://rosenzweig.io/vkquake.avif" alt="Vulkan port of Quake running on Honeykrisp"></a><br> </p> <h3 id="april-9">April 9</h3> <p>Lots of little fixes bring us to a 99.6% pass rate‚Ä¶ for Vulkan 1.1. Why stop there? NVK is 1.3 conformant, so let‚Äôs claim 1.3 and skip to the finish line.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pass</strong>: 255209, <strong>Fail</strong>: 3818, <strong>Crash</strong>: 599</p> </blockquote> <p>98.3% pass rate for 1.3 on our 1 week anniversary.</p> <p>Not bad.</p> <h3 id="april-10">April 10</h3> <p>SuperTuxKart has a Vulkan renderer.</p> <p><a href="https://rosenzweig.io/hkr-stk.png"><img src="https://rosenzweig.io/hkr-stk.avif" alt="SuperTuxKart rendering with Honeykrisp, showing Pepper (from Pepper and Carrot) riding her broomstick in the STK Enterprise"></a></p> <h3 id="april-11">April 11</h3> <p><a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/zink.html">Zink</a> works too.</p> <p><a href="https://rosenzweig.io/hkr-stk-zink.png"><img src="https://rosenzweig.io/hkr-stk-zink.avif" alt="SuperTuxKart rendering with Zink on Honeykrisp, same scene but with better lighting"></a></p> <h3 id="april-12">April 12</h3> <p>I tracked down some fails to a test bug, where an arbitrary verification threshold was too strict to pass on some devices. I filed a bug report, and it‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/VK-GL-CTS/commit/5fd73c841d775dff1ad52d8340d79dc120d64696">resolved</a> within a few weeks.</p> <h3 id="april-16">April 16</h3> <p>The tests for ‚Äúdescriptor indexing‚Äù revealed a compiler bug affecting subgroup shuffles in non-uniform control flow. The M1‚Äôs shuffle instruction is quirky, but it‚Äôs easy to workaround. Fixing that fixes the descriptor indexing tests.</p> <h3 id="april-17">April 17</h3> <p>A few tests crash inside our register allocator. Their shaders contain a peculiar construction:</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>if</span> <span>(</span>condition<span>)</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span>   <span>while</span> <span>(</span>true<span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div> <p><code>condition</code> is always false, but the compiler doesn‚Äôt know that.</p> <p>Infinite loops are nominally invalid since shaders must terminate in finite time, but this shader is syntactically valid. ‚ÄúAll loops contain a break‚Äù seems obvious for a shader, but it‚Äôs false. It‚Äôs straightforward to fix register allocation, but what a doozy.</p> <h3 id="april-18">April 18</h3> <p>Remember copies? They‚Äôre slow, and every frame currently requires a copy to get on screen.</p> <p>For ‚Äúzero copy‚Äù rendering, we need enough Linux window system integration to negotiate an efficient surface layout across process boundaries. Linux uses ‚Äúmodifiers‚Äù for this purpose, so we implement the <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier.html"><code>EXT_image_drm_format_modifier</code></a> extension. And by implement, I mean copy.</p> <p>Copies to avoid copies.</p> <h3 id="april-20">April 20</h3> <blockquote> <p><em>‚ÄúI‚Äôd like a 4K x86 Windows Direct3D PC game on a 16K arm64 Linux Vulkan Mac.‚Äù</em></p> <p>‚Ä¶</p> <p><em>‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, this is a Wendy‚Äôs.‚Äù</em></p> </blockquote> <h3 id="april-22">April 22</h3> <p>As bug fixing slows down, we step back and check our driver architecture. Since we treat all state as dynamic, we don‚Äôt pre-pack control words during pipeline creation. That adds theoretical CPU overhead.</p> <p>Is that a problem? After some optimization, <a href="https://github.com/zmike/vkoverhead">vkoverhead</a> says we‚Äôre pushing 100 million draws per second.</p> <p>I think we‚Äôre okay.</p> <h3 id="april-24">April 24</h3> <p>Time to light up YCbCr. If we don‚Äôt use special YCbCr hardware, this feature is ‚Äúsoftware-only‚Äù. However, it touches a <em>lot</em> of code.</p> <p>It touches so much code that <a href="https://mohamexiety.github.io/posts/final_report/">Mohamed Ahmed</a> spent an entire summer adding it to NVK.</p> <p>Which means he spent a summer adding it to Honeykrisp.</p> <p>Thanks, Mohamed ;-)</p> <h3 id="april-25">April 25</h3> <p>Query copies are next. In Vulkan, the application can query the number of samples rendered, writing the result into an opaque ‚Äúquery pool‚Äù. The result can be copied from the query pool on the CPU or GPU.</p> <p>For the CPU, the driver maps the pool‚Äôs internal data structure and copies the result. This may require nontrivial repacking.</p> <p>For the GPU, we need to repack in a compute shader. That‚Äôs harder, because we can‚Äôt just run C code on the GPU, right?</p> <p>‚Ä¶Actually, we can.</p> <p>A little witchcraft makes GPU query copies as easy as C.</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>void</span> copy_query<span>(</span><span>struct</span> params <span>*</span>p, <span>int</span> i<span>)</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span>  <span>uintptr_t</span> dst <span>=</span> p<span>-&gt;</span>dest <span>+</span> i <span>*</span> p<span>-&gt;</span>stride<span>;</span></span>

<span>  <span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span>  <span>...</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div> <h3 id="april-26">April 26</h3> <p>The final boss: border colours, hard mode.</p> <p>Direct3D lets the application choose an arbitrary border colour when creating a sampler. By contrast, Vulkan only requires three border colours:</p> <ul> <li><strong><code>(0, 0, 0, 0)</code></strong> ‚Äì transparent black</li> <li><strong><code>(0, 0, 0, 1)</code></strong> ‚Äì opaque black</li> <li><strong><code>(1, 1, 1, 1)</code></strong> ‚Äì opaque white</li> </ul> <p>We handled these on April 8. Unfortunately, there are two problems.</p> <p>First, we need custom border colours for Direct3D compatibility. Both <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk">DXVK</a> and <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton">vkd3d-proton</a> require the <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_custom_border_color.html"><code>EXT_custom_border_color</code></a> extension.</p> <p>Second, there‚Äôs a subtle problem with our hardware, causing dozens of fails even without custom border colours. To understand the issue, let‚Äôs revisit texture descriptors, which contain a pixel <em>format</em> and a component reordering <em>swizzle</em>.</p> <p>Some formats are implicitly reordered. Common ‚ÄúBGRA‚Äù formats swap red and blue for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74924790/why-bgra-instead-of-rgba">historical reasons</a>. The M1 does not directly support these formats. Instead, the driver composes the swizzle with the format‚Äôs reordering. If the application uses a <code>BARB</code> swizzle with a <code>BGRA</code> format, the driver uses an <code>RABR</code> swizzle with an <code>RGBA</code> format.</p> <p>There‚Äôs a catch: swizzles apply to the border colour, but formats do not. We need to <em>undo</em> the format reordering when programming the border colour for correct results after the hardware applies the composed swizzle. Our OpenGL driver implements border colours this way, because it knows the texture format when creating the sampler. Unfortunately, Vulkan doesn‚Äôt give us that information.</p> <p>Without custom border colour support, we ‚Äúshould‚Äù be okay. Swapping red and blue doesn‚Äôt change anything if the colour is white or black.</p> <p>There‚Äôs an even <em>subtler</em> catch. Vulkan mandates support for a packed 16-bit format with 4-bit components. The M1 supports a similar format‚Ä¶ but with reversed ‚Äúendianness‚Äù, swapping red and <em>alpha</em>.</p> <p>That still seems okay. For transparent black (all zero) and opaque white (all one), swapping components doesn‚Äôt change the result.</p> <p>The problem is opaque black: <code>(0, 0, 0, 1)</code>. Swapping red and alpha gives <code>(1, 0, 0, 0)</code>. Transparent red? Uh-oh.</p> <p>We‚Äôre stuck. No known hardware configuration implements correct Vulkan semantics.</p> <p>Is hope lost?</p> <p>Do we give up?</p> <p>A reasonable person would.</p> <p>I am not reasonable.</p> <p>Let‚Äôs jump into the deep end. If we implement custom border colours, opaque black becomes a special case. But how? The M1‚Äôs custom border colours entangle the texture format with the sampler. A reasonable person would skip Direct3D support.</p> <p>As you know, I am not reasonable.</p> <p>Although the hardware is unsuitable, we control software. Whenever a shader samples a texture, we‚Äôll inject code to fix up the border colour. This emulation is simple, correct, and slow. We‚Äôll use dirty driver tricks to speed it up later. For now, we eat the cost, advertise full custom border colours, and pass the opaque black tests.</p> <h3 id="april-27">April 27</h3> <p>All that‚Äôs left is some last minute bug fixing, and‚Ä¶</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pass</strong>: 686930, <strong>Fail</strong>: 0</p> </blockquote> <p>Success.</p> <h3 id="the-future">The future</h3> <p>The next task is implementing everything that <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/blob/master/VP_DXVK_requirements.json">DXVK</a> and <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/blob/master/VP_D3D12_VKD3D_PROTON_profile.json">vkd3d-proton</a> require to layer Direct3D. That includes esoteric extensions like <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_transform_feedback.html">transform feedback</a>.

    <p>A federal court jury in Seattle on Thursday ruled against Boeing in a lawsuit brought by failed electric airplane startup Zunum and awarded $81 million in damages  ‚Äî which the judge has the option to triple.</p><p>Zunum alleged that Boeing, while ostensibly investing seed money to get the startup off the ground, stole Zunum‚Äôs technology and actively undermined its attempts to build a business.</p><p>It accused Boeing of ‚Äúa targeted and coordinated campaign‚Äù to gain access to<br>its ‚Äúbusiness plan, market and technological analysis, and other trade secrets and proprietary information,‚Äù then using that to develop its own hybrid-electric plane design.</p><p>Zunum also accused Boeing of sabotaging its efforts to attract funding from aerospace suppliers Safran and United Technologies.</p><p>The jury found that Boeing had misappropriated Zunum‚Äôs trade secrets and breached its contract with the startup. </p><p>It also found that Boeing‚Äôs actions were ‚Äúwillful and malicious,‚Äù which opens the door for the judge to award triple damages plus legal costs in a case that has <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/collapsed-hybrid-electric-planemaker-zunum-sues-former-partner-boeing-alleging-misuse-of-trade-secrets/">already been running for more than four years</a>. </p>
<p>Boeing in a statement said it ‚Äúrespectfully disagrees with the jury‚Äôs verdict, which is not supported by the law or the facts. Boeing will pursue all available challenges to the judgment.‚Äù</p><p>Another part of the ruling awarded Zunum a further $12 million for Boeing‚Äôs alleged interference with Zunum‚Äôs relationship with Safran. And finally, the jury ruled the final award could be reduced by $20 million because Zunum failed to take action to mitigate the damage.</p><p>Taking all those amounts into consideration, U.S. District Judge James Robart&nbsp;could award Zunum a total of either $72 million or $235 million depending on his decision over tripling the basic damages.</p><h2>A Silicon Valley-style startup</h2><p>In 2017, Zunum, founded by Ashish Kumar and Matt Knapp, had <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/zunum-brings-silicon-valley-startup-style-to-electric-airplane-concept/">won funding from both Boeing and the state of Washington</a> for an ambitious plan to design and build a nine-seat hybrid-electric plane for city-to-city short-hop flights. </p><p>At its height, Zunum employed about 35 full-time employees at its Bothell headquarters, an additional 20 at Zunum‚Äôs electrical power facility in Elgin, Ill., near Chicago, and about 15 in Indianapolis, developing the plane‚Äôs ducted-fan propulsion system&nbsp;in a partnership with Purdue University. </p><p>But Zunum overpromised and failed to deliver. It never produced an airplane. It <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/local-electric-airplane-startup-zunum-runs-out-of-cash/">ran out of cash and collapsed in 2019</a>. </p>
<p>By then it had spent about $282,000 of a state grant and another $1.3 million from&nbsp;two investors: <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-launches-venture-capital-arm-invests-in-local-electric-airplane-firm/">Boeing‚Äôs Horizon X&nbsp;venture-capital division</a>&nbsp;and a venture-capital unit of New York-based airline JetBlue Airways.</p><p>In its response to the lawsuit, Boeing‚Äôs lawyers wrote that the story of Zunum‚Äôs demise was simply that of a typical failed startup.</p><p>‚ÄúAn ambitious startup‚Äôs reach exceeded its grasp, and investors fled,‚Äù Boeing‚Äôs filing states. ‚ÄúWhat preliminarily looked like an interesting investment prospect that promised a new hybrid electric or electric aircraft turned into a loss for Boeing.‚Äù</p><p>Rather than developing its own hybrid-electric design, Boeing said it developed only a ‚Äúconceptual mock-up ‚Äî a tool that Boeing used to evaluate the feasibility of the type of aircraft that Zunum hoped to build.‚Äù</p><p>The conclusion it drew from that mock-up was that ‚Äúelectric aircraft likely would not be economically viable for commercial passenger flights anytime soon.‚Äù</p><p>Boeing said other potential Zunum investors drew the same conclusion. It characterized the lawsuit as ‚ÄúZunum‚Äôs latest attempt to extract more money from Boeing.‚Äù</p><p>Boeing has not publicly announced any proposal for its own version of a small hybrid-electric airplane.</p><p>The jury having sided with Zunum, Judge Robart will now decide the precise damages award and then Boeing will appeal. </p><p>The final outcome could still be some years away.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large Language Models (LLMs) are often described as being instances of foundation models - that is, models that transfer strongly across various tasks and conditions in few-show or zero-shot manner, while exhibiting scaling laws that predict function improvement when increasing the pre-training scale. These claims of excelling in different functions and tasks rely on measurements taken across various sets of standardized benchmarks showing high scores for such models. We demonstrate here a dramatic breakdown of function and reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art models trained at the largest available scales which claim strong function, using a simple, short, conventional common sense problem formulated in concise natural language, easily solvable by humans. The breakdown is dramatic, as models also express strong overconfidence in their wrong solutions, while providing often non-sensical "reasoning"-like explanations akin to confabulations to justify and backup the validity of their clearly failed responses, making them sound plausible. Various standard interventions in an attempt to get the right solution, like various type of enhanced prompting, or urging the models to reconsider the wrong solutions again by multi step re-evaluation, fail. We take these initial observations to the scientific and technological community to stimulate urgent re-assessment of the claimed capabilities of current generation of LLMs, Such re-assessment also requires common action to create standardized benchmarks that would allow proper detection of such basic reasoning deficits that obviously manage to remain undiscovered by current state-of-the-art evaluation procedures and benchmarks.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/05/agile_failure_rates/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/05/agile_failure_rates/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40584901">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A study has found that projects adopting Agile practices are 268 percent more likely to fail than those that do not.</p>
<p>Even though the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.engprax.com/post/268-higher-failure-rates-for-agile-software-projects-study-finds">research</a> commissioned by consultancy Engprax could be seen as a thinly veiled plug for Impact Engineering methodology, it feeds into the suspicion that the Agile Manifesto <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/01/08/erik_meijer_agile_is_a_cancer_we_have_to_eliminate_from_the_industry/">might not be all it's cracked up to be</a>.</p>
<p>The study's fieldwork was conducted between May 3 and May 7 with 600 software engineers (250 in the UK and 350 in the US) participating. One standout statistic was that projects with clear requirements documented before development started were 97 percent more likely to succeed. In comparison, one of the four pillars of the Agile Manifesto is "Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation."</p>

    

<p>According to the study, putting a specification in place before development begins can result in a 50 percent increase in success, and making sure the requirements are accurate to the real-world problem can lead to a 57 percent increase.</p>

        


        

<p>Dr Junade Ali, author of Impact Engineering, said: "With 65 percent of projects adopting Agile practices failing to be delivered on time, it's time to question Agile's cult following.</p>
<p>"Our research has shown that what matters when it comes to delivering high-quality software on time and within budget is a robust requirements engineering process and having the psychological safety to discuss and solve problems when they emerge, whilst taking steps to prevent developer burnout."</p>

        

<p>The Agile Manifesto has been criticized over the years. The infamous UK Post Office Horizon IT system was an early large-scale project to use the methodology, although blaming an Agile approach for the system's design flaws seems a bit of a stretch.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/14/uk_developer_burnout/">Report: 83% of UK software engineers suffer burnout, COVID-19 made it worse</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/17/twilio_jeff_lawson_on_developers/">'Business folk often don't understand what developers do...' Twilio boss on the chasm that holds companies back</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/01/ibm_global_tech_services_uk_layoffs/">IBM warns Global Tech Services staff that 346 UK heads will roll in latest redundancy action</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/01/08/erik_meijer_agile_is_a_cancer_we_have_to_eliminate_from_the_industry/">Erik Meijer: AGILE must be destroyed, once and for all</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is also easy to forget that other methodologies have their own flaws. Waterfall, for example, uses a succession of documented phases, of which coding is only a part. While simple to understand and manage, Waterfall can also be slow and costly, with changes challenging to implement.</p>
<p>Hence, there is a tendency for teams to look for alternatives.</p>
<p>Projects where engineers felt they had the freedom to discuss and address problems were 87 percent more likely to succeed. Worryingly, workers in the UK were 13 percent less likely to feel they could discuss problems than those in the US, according to the study.</p>
<p>Many sins of today's tech world tend to be attributed to the Agile Manifesto. A neverending stream of patches indicates that quality might not be what it once was, and code turning up in an unfinished or ill-considered state have all been attributed to Agile practices.</p>

        

<p>One Agile developer criticized the daily stand-up element, describing it to <i>The Register</i> as "a feast of regurgitation."</p>
<p>However, while the Agile Manifesto might have its problems, those stem more from its implementation rather than the principles themselves. "We don't need a test team because we're Agile" is a cost-saving abdication of responsibility.</p>
<p>In highlighting the need to understand the requirements before development begins, the research charts a path between Agile purists and Waterfall advocates. ¬Æ</p>

<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/bartender/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bartender</a> is a popular Mac app that lets users customize and add new functions to the macOS Menu Bar. However, the app was recently acquired by new and unknown developers without disclosure, which raised concerns among current Bartender users.</p>



<h2 id="h-bartender-users-skeptical-of-new-app-owners">Bartender users skeptical of new app owners</h2>



<p>As shared in an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1d7zjv8/bartender_5_not_safe_anymore_warning_from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extensive Reddit thread</a>, many users only became aware that Bartender had been sold to another developer after MacUpdater sent out an alert about the update to version 5.0.52. </p>



<p>‚ÄúMacUpdater Upgrade Explanation: The company and developer behind Bartender was replaced in a silent and dubious manner ‚Äì updates to version 5.0.52 and newer are your own risk and responsibility,‚Äù the alert reads. Users were worried since the app‚Äôs creator hasn‚Äôt said a word about the acquisition, not even the new developer.</p>



<p>Following the repercussions, a Reddit user identified as ‚ÄúOrdinary_Delivery_79‚Äù <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1d7zjv8/comment/l73h9gv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a comment</a> representing the ‚Äúnew owners of Bartender.‚Äù According to the user, the app was acquired from the original developer two months ago, and now the team is working on updating the app‚Äôs certificates to re-sign it with Apple.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Truth be told, we should have notated it on the release notes but, since we could not update them retroactively, we included this fact on our blog &amp; shared it with users as they emailed us. We‚Äôve collaborated closely with Ben to understand his vision for Bartender. Our goal is to implement many of the improvements he had planned and address any reported bugs from the past few months to enhance Bartender‚Äôs performance.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Even so, it still seems a bit suspicious that the new developers only introduced themselves after all the controversy. Some users said they didn‚Äôt trust the app‚Äôs new owners and uninstalled it. <a href="https://www.macbartender.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bartender‚Äôs official website</a> has no mention of the acquisition.</p>



<p>Future plans for the app remain unknown, but users have a right to know what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>A new report on old privacy incidents suggests that at least one Nintendo leak came from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/google/" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/google/">Google</a> employee showing off private <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/youtube/" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/youtube/">YouTube</a> videos to a friend.</p><p>The leak in question dates back to 2017, when images of a trailer for the then-untitled Yoshi's Crafted World hit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/6gyd01/a_new_yoshi_game_probably_woolly_world_2_is_going/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/6gyd01/a_new_yoshi_game_probably_woolly_world_2_is_going/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Reddit</a> shortly before the game's official reveal. In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/6gyd01/a_new_yoshi_game_probably_woolly_world_2_is_going/diu29u7/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/6gyd01/a_new_yoshi_game_probably_woolly_world_2_is_going/diu29u7/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">comments</a>, the poster of that thread said "My friend work at google and he send this photo to me. It's a video that it's already in Nintendo channel and is going to be in public after the reveal." The image included an 'admin.youtube.com' URL, which certainly suggested that this particular call was coming from inside the house.</p><p>Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.404media.co/google-contractor-used-admin-access-to-leak-private-nintendo-youtube-video/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.404media.co/google-contractor-used-admin-access-to-leak-private-nintendo-youtube-video/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">404 Media</a> has published a breakdown of several privacy incidents at Google based on internal reports at the company, including this one. The employee, apparently a former temporary contractor, was able to "download video with admin account, and shared unreleased Nintendo feature with friend," Google's internal report concluded. "GI interview concluded non-intentional. Reactive comm sent."</p><p>The community has long suspected that many notable leakers get their information from sources like unpublished YouTube videos, and this report would appear to confirm that - at least in this instance. Judging by the admin URL in the leak screenshot, I'd wager this particular leaker had no intentions of this image being widely spread. But then, you'd also hope that your friends are cautious enough to keep you shielded from Nintendo's ire, too.</p><p>Industry analyst Daniel Ahmad <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1797629349199483261" target="_blank" data-url="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1797629349199483261" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">says</a> he's "heard this is how a number of game leakers operate today still," but some of those leakers are quick to suggest they've got other sources. Prolific Nintendo leaker Pyoro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Pyoro_X/status/1797640723803803702" target="_blank" data-url="https://x.com/Pyoro_X/status/1797640723803803702" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">says</a> they've provided info that couldn't be pulled from YouTube, for example. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/summer-game-fest-schedule-2024/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.gamesradar.com/summer-game-fest-schedule-2024/">Summer Game Fest schedule for 2024</a> coming up in hurry, there's certain to be a lot of interest in leakers and where their information is coming from over the next few days.</p><p>As for Google, though, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.404media.co/google-leak-reveals-thousands-of-privacy-incidents/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.404media.co/google-leak-reveals-thousands-of-privacy-incidents/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">404 Media</a> is reporting on some much more serious privacy breaches than leaked video game announcements. The report notes incidents between 2013 and 2018 where Google Street View transcribed and stored license plate information, where a Google speech service logged an "estimated 1K child speech utterances," and where subsidiary Waze leaked the trips and home addresses of users of its carpool app.</p><p>These reports, again, come from Google's internal review process, and the company says in a statement that "every one was reviewed and resolved at that time. In some cases, these employee flags turned out not to be issues at all or were issues that employees found in third party services."</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-cJopebsdnmbDw25H8RHyfZ"><section><p>Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more</p></section></div><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/games-of-summer-game-fest-2024-publisher-predictions/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/games-of-summer-game-fest-2024-publisher-predictions/"><em>Predicting the games of Summer Game Fest 2024</em></a><em> is a lot easier when it's all leaking.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Members of the Legendary Computer Bugs Tribunal, honored guests, if I may have your attention? I would, humbly, submit a new contender for your esteemed judgment. You may or may not find it novel, you may even deign to call it a "bug," but I assure you, you will find it entertaining.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="https://www.nethack.org/"><em>NetHack</em></a>. It is one of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/ascii-art-permadeath-the-history-of-roguelike-games/">the all-time roguelike</a> games, and I mean that in the more strict sense of that term. The content is procedurally generated, deaths are permanent, and the only thing you keep from game to game is your skill and knowledge. I do understand that the only thing two roguelike fans can agree on is how wrong the third roguelike fan is in their definition of roguelike, but, please, let us move on.</p>
<h2><em>NetHack</em> is great for machine learning‚Ä¶</h2>
<p>Being a difficult game full of consequential choices and random challenges, as well as a "single-agent" game that can be generated and played at lightning speed on modern computers, <em>NetHack</em> is great for those working in machine learning‚Äîor <a href="https://underactuated.mit.edu/imitation.html">imitation learning</a>, actually, as detailed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09423">Jens Tuyls' paper</a> on how compute scaling affects single-agent game learning. Using Tuyls' model of expert <em>NetHack</em> behavior, Bart≈Çomiej Cupia≈Ç and Maciej Wo≈Çczyk trained a neural network to play and improve itself using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a>.
</p><p>By mid-May of this year, the two had their model consistently scoring 5,000 points by their own metrics. Then, on one run, the model suddenly got worse, on the order of 40 percent. It scored 3,000 points. Machine learning generally, gradually, goes in one direction with these types of problems. It didn't make sense.</p>
<p>Cupia≈Ç and Wo≈Çczyk tried quite a few things: reverting their code, restoring their entire software stack from a Singularity backup, and rolling back their <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit">CUDA</a> libraries. The result? 3,000 points. They rebuild everything from scratch, and it's still 3,000 points.</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><img alt="<em>NetHack</em>, played by a regular human." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/13863751533_64654db44e_o.png" width="821" height="506"><figcaption><p><em>NetHack</em>, played by a regular human.</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2>‚Ä¶ except on certain nights</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/cupiabart/status/1793930355617259811?s=46">detailed</a> in Cupia≈Ç's X (formerly Twitter) thread, this was several hours of confused trial and error by him and Wo≈Çczyk. "<span>I am starting to feel like a madman. I can't even watch a TV show constantly thinking about the bug," Cupia≈Ç wrote. In desperation, he asks model author Tuyls if he knows what could be wrong. He wakes up in Krak√≥w to an answer:</span></p>
<p><span>"Oh yes, it's probably a full moon today."</span></p>
<p>In <em>NetHack</em>, the game in which the DevTeam has <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/The_DevTeam_Thinks_of_Everything">thought of everything</a>, if the game detects from your system clock that it should be a full moon, it will generate a message: "You are lucky! Full moon tonight." A full moon imparts <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Time">a few player benefits</a>: a single point added to Luck, and werecreatures mostly kept to their animal forms.</p>
<p>It's an easier game, all things considered, so why would the learning agent's score be lower? It simply doesn't have data about full moon variables in its training data, so a branching series of decisions likely leads to lesser outcomes, or just confusion. It was indeed a full moon in <span>Krak√≥w</span> when the 3,000-ish scores started showing up. What a terrible night to have a learning model.</p>
<p>Of course, "score" is not a real metric for success in <em>NetHack</em>, as <a href="https://x.com/CupiaBart/status/1794614271281905955">Cupia≈Ç himself noted</a>. Ask a model to get the best score, and it will farm the heck out of early-stage monsters because it never gets bored. "<span>Finding items required for [ascension] or even [just] doing a quest is too much for pure RL agent," Cupia≈Ç wrote. Another neural network, <a href="https://github.com/maciej-sypetkowski/autoascend">AutoAscend</a>, does a better job of progressing through the game, but "even it can only solve sokoban and reach mines end," Cupia≈Ç <a href="https://x.com/CupiaBart/status/1794440727117668776">notes</a>.</span></p>
<h2>Is it a bug?</h2>
<p>I submit to you that, although <em>NetHack</em> responded to the full moon in its intended way, this quirky, very hard-to-fathom stop on a machine-learning journey was indeed a bug and a worthy one in the pantheon. It's not <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/worlds-first-computer-bug/">a Harvard moth</a>, nor a <a href="http://web.mit.edu/jemorris/humor/500-miles">500-mile email</a>, but what is?</p>
<p>Because the team used <a href="https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html">Singularity</a> to back up and restore their stack, they inadvertently carried forward the machine time and resulting bug each time they tried to solve it. The machine's resulting behavior was so bizarre, and seemingly based on unseen forces, that it drove a coder into fits. And the story has a beginning, a climactic middle, and a denouement that teaches us something, however obscure.</p>
<p>The <em>NetHack</em> Lunar Learning Bug is, I submit, quite worth memorializing. Thank you for your time.</p>

<ul>
<li>Google Maps is sunsetting web access for its Timeline feature that allows users to view their location history.</li>
<li>The company is switching to an on-device approach that is more private and works on each phone independently.</li>
<li>After transitioning, users will be able to back up and restore their Timeline data to avoid losing it when switching devices.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>For years, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/current-location-google-maps-3100375/">Google Maps</a> has allowed users to track the locations they visit using its Timeline feature. The option works in the background and keeps track of users‚Äô movement at all times. Those who opted in can view their location history on the web and in the Google Maps app. To keep users‚Äô sensitive location data more private and secure, Google Maps will sunset web access for its Timeline feature in the coming months.</p><p>As per an <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-maps-timeline-location-data-on-device-migration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Android Police</em></a> report, Google Maps has started emailing users about changes coming to the <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/14169818?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;oco=1#zippy=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Timeline feature</a>. The company plans to sunset web access and switch to a more private, on-device approach. This would make Google Maps‚Äô Timeline data unique to each connected phone ‚Äî as the migration would deactivate the universal sync mechanism.</p><p>Once your account is ready to transition, Google Maps should alert you via email and a push notification. Through a dedicated button on the updated app, you‚Äôll then be able to migrate your existing location history to the on-device database. If you take no action and miss the deadline, Google could purge some or all of your location history when it sunsets Timeline‚Äôs web access.</p><p>To help users retain their data in the long run, Google Maps has also introduced a new backup feature for Timeline. Users can rely on it to save encrypted copies of their location history on Google‚Äôs servers. They can then restore these backups in the Google Maps app when they switch to a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-phones-568001/">new phone</a>.</p><p>It‚Äôs currently unclear when Google Maps will completely kill Timeline‚Äôs web access. The company is seemingly assigning users different deadlines, with one being on December 1, 2024. Worry not, though, as Google won‚Äôt wipe your location history before alerting you in advance. So, if you haven‚Äôt been notified by the company yet, you can continue using the feature normally until further notice.</p><p><strong>Got a tip?

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration approved the commercial launch license for the fourth test flight of SpaceX's Starship rocket Tuesday, with liftoff from South Texas targeted for just after sunrise Thursday.</p>
<p>"The FAA has approved a license authorization for SpaceX Starship Flight 4," the agency said in a statement. "SpaceX met all safety and other licensing requirements for this test flight."</p>
<p>Shortly after the FAA announced the launch license, SpaceX confirmed plans to launch the fourth test flight of the world's largest rocket at 7:00 am CDT (12:00 UTC) Thursday. The launch window runs for two hours.</p>
<p>This flight follows three prior demonstration missions, each progressively more successful, of SpaceX's privately developed mega-rocket. The last time Starship flew‚Äîon March 14‚Äîit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/03/after-its-third-test-flight-spacexs-starship-could-soon-carry-satellites/">completed an eight-and-a-half minute climb into space</a>, but the ship was unable to maneuver itself as it coasted nearly 150 miles (250 km) above Earth. This <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/05/spacex-sets-next-starship-flight-date-will-focus-on-propulsion-and-landing/">controllability problem caused the rocket to break apart</a> during reentry.</p>
<p>On Thursday's flight, SpaceX officials will expect the ascent portion of the test flight to be similarly successful to the launch in March. The objectives this time will be to demonstrate Starship's ability to survive the most extreme heating of reentry, when temperatures peak at 2,600¬∞ Fahrenheit (1,430¬∞ Celsius) as the vehicle plunges into the atmosphere at more than 20 times the speed of sound.</p>
<p>SpaceX officials also hope to see the Super Heavy booster guide itself toward a soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico just offshore from the company's launch site, known as Starbase, in Cameron County, Texas.</p>
<p>"The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy," SpaceX wrote in an overview of the mission.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Last month, SpaceX completed a "wet dress rehearsal" at Starbase, where the launch team fully loaded the rocket with cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen propellants. Before the practice countdown, SpaceX test-fired the booster and ship at the launch site. More recently, technicians installed components of the rocket's self-destruct system, which would activate to blow up the rocket if it flies off course.</p>
<p>Then, on Tuesday, SpaceX lowered the Starship upper stage from the top of the Super Heavy booster, presumably to perform final touch-ups to the ship's heat shield, composed of 18,000 hexagonal ceramic tiles to protect its stainless-steel structure during reentry. Ground teams were expected to raise the ship, or upper stage, back on top of the booster sometime Wednesday, returning the rocket to its full height of 397 feet (121 meters) ahead of Thursday morning's launch window.</p>
<h2>The tick-tock of Starship‚Äôs fourth flight</h2>
<p>If all goes according to plan, SpaceX's launch team will start loading 10 million pounds of super-cold propellants into the rocket around 49 minutes before liftoff Thursday. The methane and liquid oxygen will first flow into the smaller tanks on the ship, then into the larger tanks on the booster.</p>
<p>The rocket should be fully loaded about three minutes prior to launch, and, following a sequence of automated checks, the computer controlling the countdown will give the command to light the booster's 33 Raptor engines. Three seconds later, the rocket will begin its vertical climb off the launch mount, with its engines capable of producing more than 16 million pounds of thrust at full power.</p>
<p>Heading east from the Texas Gulf Coast, the rocket will exceed the speed of sound in about a minute, then begin shutting down its 33 main engines around 2 minutes and 41 seconds after liftoff. Then, just as the Super Heavy booster jettisons to begin a descent back to Earth, Starship's six Raptor engines will ignite to continue pushing the upper portion of the rocket into space. Starship's engines are expected to burn until T+ 8 minutes, 23 seconds, accelerating the rocket to near-orbital velocity with enough energy to fly an arcing trajectory halfway around the world to the Indian Ocean.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>All of this will be similar to the events of the last Starship launch in March. What differs in the flight plan this time involves the attempts to steer the booster and ship back to Earth. This is important to lay the groundwork for future flights, when SpaceX wants to bring the Super Heavy booster‚Äîthe size of the fuselage of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet‚Äîto a landing back at its launch pad. Eventually, SpaceX also intends to recover reusable Starships back at Starbase or other spaceports.</p>

<p>Based on the results of the March test flight, SpaceX still has a lot to prove in these areas. On that flight, the engines on the Super Heavy booster could not complete all the burns required to guide the rocket toward the splashdown zone in the Gulf of Mexico. The booster lost control as it plummeted toward the ocean.</p>
<p>Engineers traced the failure to blockage in a filter where liquid oxygen flows into the Raptor engines. Notably, a similar problem occurred on the second Starship test flight last November. The Super Heavy booster awaiting launch Thursday has additional hardware to improve propellant filtration capabilities, according to SpaceX. The company also implemented "operational changes" on the booster for the upcoming test flight, including to jettison the Super Heavy's staging ring, which sits between the booster and ship during launch, to reduce the rocket's mass during descent.</p>
<p>SpaceX has a lot of experience bringing back its fleet of Falcon 9 boosters. The company now boasts a streak of more than 240 successful rocket landings in a row, so it's reasonable to expect SpaceX will overcome the challenge of recovering the larger Super Heavy booster.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
  
<p>GitHub is ecstatic to unveil Arm<sup>‚ìá</sup>-based Linux and Windows runners for GitHub Actions. This new addition to our suite of hosted runners provides power, performance and sustainability improvements for all your GitHub Actions jobs. Developers can now take advantage of Arm-based hardware hosted by GitHub to build and deploy their release assets anywhere Arm architecture is used. Best of all, these runners are priced at 37% less than our x64 Linux and Windows runners.</p>
<p>Customers are refactoring their applications to take advantage of the price and performance benefits of Arm architecture. These new runners provide power, performance, and sustainability improvements for all your GitHub Actions jobs and are designed to efficiently run large cloud-native workloads. Developers in every industry‚Äîfrom gaming to embedded mobile development‚Äîare able to take advantage of the performance these new runners offer.</p>
<p>These runners are fully managed by GitHub with an image built by Arm containing all the tools needed for developers to get started. They offer a power-efficient compute layer that can increase price-to-performance ratios, allowing customers to optimize compute costs to get more done within existing budgets while also reducing their carbon footprint.</p>
<p>Previously, developers building on Arm within GitHub have had to self-host or utilize QEMU virtualization which is slower than running natively. Customers can now build, test, and deploy their web and application servers, open-source databases, containers, microservices, Java and .NET applications, AI applications, gaming, or media servers on the Arm architecture, bringing their entire CI/CD workflow onto one platform while also benefiting from the scale and speed gained from using GitHub-hosted runners.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>We leveraged Arm runners to very quickly set up a workflow to build a Linux Arm64 binary for our open source Rust project, Spice.ai OSS, and it‚Äôs been rock-solid‚Äìwe haven‚Äôt had any issues with it since we set it up. We‚Äôve saved 2-3 days of engineering effort up front to set up our own runners, plus about 1-2 hours per week to maintain them ourselves.</p></blockquote><figcaption> - Phillip LeBlanc // Founder and CTO, Spice AI</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="github-and-arm-a-new-class-of-image">GitHub and Arm: A new class of image<a href="#github-and-arm-a-new-class-of-image" aria-label="GitHub and Arm: A new class of image"></a></h2>
<p>GitHub has partnered with Arm to provide the Ubuntu and Windows VM images for these runners, ensuring our customers can seamlessly start building on Arm. The Ubuntu 22.04 image is equipped with a full set of tools to jumpstart developers quickly on Arm runners and begin deploying Arm release assets as soon as possible, with plans to add developer tools to the Windows image and a new Ubuntu 24.04 image.</p>
<p>GitHub is excited to present these partner images to our customers. We are committed to partnering with the best technology providers on the market to provide a wide range of images for our customers to build on. These partnerships are focused on providing a best-in-class experience that can be leveraged across industries. We began this with our GPU runners, launched in April, by offering an image built by NVIDIA aimed at companies wanting to incorporate their MLOps practices into GitHub Actions. As we expand our GitHub-hosted runner fleet, we will continue to expand image options in parallel through close partnerships with industry-leading technology providers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur longstanding partnership with GitHub is rooted in empowering shift-left software development and accelerating time to market while improving sustainability,‚Äù said Bhumik Patel, Director of Software Ecosystem Development, Infrastructure Line of Business at Arm. ‚ÄúThe availability of Arm-hosted runners marks an important step toward more sustainable computing by enabling software developers with advanced CI/CD capabilities to develop the power-efficient and versatile Arm architecture for projects, from data centers and cloud to automotive, IoT, and much more.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="sustainability-on-github-actions">Sustainability on GitHub Actions<a href="#sustainability-on-github-actions" aria-label="Sustainability on GitHub Actions"></a></h2>
<p>GitHub is committed to sustainability, and to helping customers on their journey to reduce their own carbon emissions. By using these new Arm-hosted runners, customers can lower their carbon footprint by running on machines that are proven to be more power efficient. Arm-based servers in the cloud have been shown to use 30-40% less power output for some of the most widely deployed workloads. [<a href="https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/insights/focus/will-java-run-more-sustainably-on-arms-architecture#:~:text=The%20higher%20power%20efficiency%20of,critical%20reporting%20metrics%20for%20corporations">Source</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2023/03/01/ampere-is-driving-sustainability-using-the-right-metricpower-at-the-rack/?sh=41e3613e2ed9">source</a>]</p>
<p>Arm technology has been shown to reduce heat generation and lower power consumption in data centers. To help understand your own impact, you can <a href="https://github.com/green-coding-solutions/eco-ci-energy-estimation">use this tool</a> to measure the energy consumption of each of your GitHub Actions workflow runs.</p>
<h2 id="get-started-using-arm-hosted-runners-today">Get started using Arm-hosted runners today!<a href="#get-started-using-arm-hosted-runners-today" aria-label="Get started using Arm-hosted runners today!"></a></h2>
<p>These runners are available to our customers on our GitHub Team and Enterprise Cloud plans. We expect to begin offering Arm runners for open source projects by the end of the year. Customers can begin using these runners today by creating an Arm runner in their organization/enterprise, and then updating the <code>runs-on</code> syntax in their GitHub Actions workflow file to call that runner name. Find out more information on how to set up Arm-hosted runners in <a href="https://youtu.be/vrr_OgMk458">this video</a> or in our <a href="https://docs.github.com/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-larger-runners/about-larger-runners">public documentation</a>.

        <em>Beating another dead horse.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Although I live in Copenhagen and mostly walk or ride my bicycle in order to get around town, I do own an old car for getting around the rest of the country. In Denmark, cars go through mandatory official inspection every other year, and I've been through a few of these in my life. A few years ago, the mechanic doing the inspection informed me that my car's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_number">chassis number</a> was incorrect.
    </p>
    <p>
        This did make me a bit nervous, because I'd bought the car used, and I was suddenly concerned that things weren't really as I thought. Had I unwittingly bought a stolen car?
    </p>
    <p>
        But the mechanic just walked over to his computer in order to correct the error. That's when a different kind of unease hit me. When you've programmed for some decades, you learn to foresee various typical failure modes. Since a chassis number is an obvious candidate for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_key">natural key</a>, I already predicted that changing the number would prove to be either impossible, or have all sorts of cascading effects, ultimately terminating in official records no longer recognizing that the car is mine.
    </p>
    <p>
        As it turned out, though, whoever made that piece of software knew what they were doing, because the mechanic just changed the chassis number, and that was that. This is now five or six years ago, and I still own the same car, and I've never had any problems with the official ownership records.
    </p>
    <h3 id="8a38dcbfae1146f8868fe8a408ffe5d8">
        Uniqueness <a href="#8a38dcbfae1146f8868fe8a408ffe5d8">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        The reason I related this story is that I'm currently following an undergraduate course in databases and information systems. Since this course is aimed at students with no real-world experience, it wisely moves forward in a pedagogical progression. In order to teach database keys, it starts with natural keys. From a didactic perspective, this makes sense, but the result, so far, is that the young people I work with now propose database designs with natural keys.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not blaming anyone. You have to learn to crawl before you can walk.
    </p>
    <p>
        Still, this situation made me reflect on the following question: <em>Are natural keys ever a good idea?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's consider an example. For a little project we're doing, we've created a database of <a href="https://www.theworlds50best.com/">the World's 50 best restaurants</a>. My fellow students suggest a table design like this:
    </p>
    <pre><span>CREATE</span>&nbsp;<span>TABLE</span>&nbsp;Restaurants<span>&nbsp;</span><span>(</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>year</span>&nbsp;<span>TEXT</span>&nbsp;<span>NOT</span>&nbsp;<span>NULL,</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>rank</span>&nbsp;<span>TEXT</span>&nbsp;<span>NOT</span>&nbsp;<span>NULL,</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restaurantName&nbsp;<span>TEXT</span>&nbsp;<span>NOT</span>&nbsp;<span>NULL,</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cityName&nbsp;<span>TEXT</span>&nbsp;<span>NOT</span>&nbsp;<span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span></pre>
    
    <p>
        Granted, at this point, this table definition defines no key at all. I'm not complaining about that. After all, a month ago, the students probably hadn't seen a database table.
    </p>
    <p>
        From following the course curriculum, it'd be natural, however, to define a key for the <code>Restaurants</code> table as the combination of <code>restaurantName</code>, <code>cityName</code>, and <code>year</code>. The assumption is that name and city uniquely identifies a restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this particular example, this assumption may actually turn out to hold. So far. After all, the data set isn't that big, and it's important for restaurants in that league to have recognizable names. If I had to guess, I'd say that there's probably only one <a href="https://www.nobelhartundschmutzig.com/">Nobelhart &amp; Schmutzig</a> in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Still, a good software architect should challenge the underlying assumptions. Is name and city a <em>natural</em> key? It's easy to imagine that it's not. What if we expand the key to include the country as well? Okay, but what if we had a restaurant named <em>China Wok</em> in Springfield, USA? Hardly unique. Add the state, you say? Probably still not unique.
    </p>
    <h3 id="778bd217e62d4ffca25f487a39d34c1a">
        Identity <a href="#778bd217e62d4ffca25f487a39d34c1a">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Ensuring uniqueness is only the first of many problems with natural keys. You may quickly reach the conclusion that for a restaurant database, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key">synthetic key</a> is probably the best choice.
    </p>
    <p>
        But what about 'natural' natural keys, so to speak? An example may be a car's chassis number. This is already an opaque number, and it probably originates from a database somewhere. Or how about a personal identification number? In Denmark we have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_identification_number_(Denmark)">CPR number</a>, and I understand that the US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_number">Social Security Number</a> is vaguely analogous.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're designing a database that already includes such a personal identification number, you might be tempted to use it as a natural key. After all, it's already a key somewhere else, so it's guaranteed to be unique, right?
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes, the number may uniquely identify a person, but the converse may not be true. A person may have more than one identification number. At least when time is a factor.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an example, for technical-historical reasons, the Danish CPR number carries information (which keys shouldn't do), such as a person's date of birth and sex. Since 2014 a new law enables transsexual citizens to get a new CPR number that reflects their perceived gender. The consequence is that the same person may have more than one CPR number. Perhaps not more than one at the same time, but definitely two during a lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even if existing keys are guaranteed to be unique, you can't assume that the uniqueness gives rise to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection">bijection</a>. If you use an external unique key, you may lose track of the entities that you're trying to keep track of.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is true not only for people, but cars, bicycles (which also have chassis numbers), network cards, etc.
    </p>
    <h3 id="93d43ca6c76a4c6c83e9542bb671f39c">
        Clerical errors <a href="#93d43ca6c76a4c6c83e9542bb671f39c">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Finally, even if you've found a natural key that is guaranteed to be unique <em>and</em> track the actual entity that you want to keep track of, there's a final argument against using an externally defined key in your system: Data-entry errors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take the story about my car's chassis number. The mechanic who spotted the discrepancy clearly interpreted it as a clerical error.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a few decades of programming, I've learned that sooner or later, there <em>will</em> be errors in your data. Either it's a clerical error, or the end-user mistyped, or there was a data conversion error when importing from an external system. Or even data conversion errors within the <em>same</em> system, as it goes through upgrades and migrations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your system should be designed to allow corrections to data. This includes corrections of external keys, such as chassis numbers, government IDs, etc. This means that you can't use such keys as database keys in your own system.
    </p>
    <h3 id="ca9efd721698452f856b089fc3f69ad1">
        Heuristic <a href="#ca9efd721698452f856b089fc3f69ad1">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Many were the times, earlier in my career, when I decided to use a 'natural key' as a key in my own database. As far as I recall, I've regretted it every single time.
    </p>
    <p>
        These days I follow a hard heuristic: Always use synthetic keys for database tables.
    </p>
    <h3 id="c174062e2ad14b6a9ff4056b1de80a0f">
        Conclusion <a href="#c174062e2ad14b6a9ff4056b1de80a0f">#</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Is it ever a good idea to use natural keys in a database design? My experience tells me that it's not. Ultimately, regardless of how certain you can be that the natural key is stable and correctly tracks the entity that it's supposed to keep track of, data errors will occur. This includes errors in those natural keys.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should be able to correct such errors without losing track of the involved entities. You'll regret using natural keys. Use synthetic keys.

MacUpdater warned users that updates to the app from version 5.0.52 could be potentially unsafe due to the lack of transparency surrounding the situation.</p>
<p>Bartender's new owners replied to the Reddit thread and confirmed that Bartender had been acquired, but did not explain why customers had not been notified nor why there had been a certificate change without said explanation.<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey everyone, new owners of Bartender here! Our team acquired Bartender from Ben S, the original developer, two months ago. As we prepare to roll out updates for Bartender, we needed to re-sign the app with Apple using our company's information, replacing Ben's. This led to a one-time certificate change.</p>
<p>Truth be told, we should have notated it on the release notes but, since we could not update them retroactively, we included this fact on our blog &amp; shared it with users as they emailed us. We've collaborated closely with Ben to understand his vision for Bartender. Our goal is to implement many of the improvements he had planned and address any reported bugs from the past few months to enhance Bartender's performance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reddit users asked Bartender's owners for more information on their identity, but there was no response. The Bartender website was updated with information about the certificate change after users began seeing popups asking for new permissions, and while the blog post calls the new certificate request "expected and valid," no background information is provided on the purchase. In the Reddit thread, the owners claim to have posted information about the sale on the website, but that has turned out to be untrue.</p>
<p>At this point, it does not appear that Bartender's new owners plan to inform customers about the change in ownership, but users should be aware that the app has been sold and is no longer being updated by the original developer. The new owner's intentions are not clear, but as Reddit users have pointed out, the situation raises some red flags.</p>

        <p>This article will be part of a more extended series in which I plan to explore various aspects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis">Fourier Mathematics</a>. I will take notes, create some visuals (a good pretext to learn more about graphics), and hope that it will be useful to someone other than me.</p>

<p>The article has yet to be thoroughly reviewed by anyone other than me, so I put it online, hoping to get some feedback before bringing it to a final state.</p>

<h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of contents</h2>

<p>In this series, we will start with a brief recap of some of the math concepts related to the circle, including trigonometric functions like sine and cosine. We‚Äôll also discuss Euler‚Äôs identity, introduce the concept of a sinusoid (and complex sinusoid), and finally, we‚Äôll introduce the concept of Fourier Series.</p>

<p>The animations used in this series are original, although I drew inspiration from some existing materials found on the web. Please keep in mind that this is not a comprehensive course on the topic, so if you‚Äôre really interested in learning more, I recommend taking a full course on the subject.</p>

<h2 id="the-circle">The Circle</h2>

<p>It all starts with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"><em>The Circle</em></a>:</p>



<p>The Circle is a geometrical figure with a center \(P(a, b)\), and a radius \(r\).</p>

<p>It has the following associated equation:</p>

\[(x-a)^{2} + (y-b)^{2} = r^2\]

<p>If \(a=0, b=0\) and \(r=1\), the circle becomes less generic, so we call it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle"><em>The Unit Circle</em></a>:</p>



<p>The equation for <em>The Unit Circle</em> is:</p>

\[x^2+y^2=1\]

<p>One could argue <em>The Circle</em> is the epitome of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry">symmetry</a>.</p>

<p>Pick one point, \(A\), then its reflection <em>on the other side</em>, \(A^{'}\), and start rotating:</p>



<p>What happens on <em>The Circle</em>, stays on <em>The Circle</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-number-pi">The number \(\pi\)</h2>

<p>We rarely see angles expressed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)">degrees</a>; usually, we represent them in relation to the number <a href="https://www.andreinc.net/2024/04/24/(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi)">PI</a> \(\pi\): \(\pi\), \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), \(\frac{\pi}{3}\), \(\frac{\pi}{4}\), etc.;</p>

<p>\(\pi\) is the ratio of a circle‚Äôs circumference to its diameter. <code>œÄ ‚âà 3.14</code>.</p>



<p>If \(r \neq 1\), the circle‚Äôs perimeter is \(P=2\pi r\), while the area is \(A=\pi r^2\). Both \(A\) and \(P\) depend on \(\pi\).</p>

<p>\(\pi\) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number">irrational</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number">transcendental</a>.</p>

<h2 id="radians">Radians</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian"><code>radian</code></a> (or <code>rad</code>) is the <em>actual</em> unit we use to measure angles. An intimate relationship exists between the <code>radian</code> and the number \(\pi\).</p>



<p>To transform an angle measured in degrees (\(360¬∞\)) to radians, the algorithm is simple: we multiply the angle by \(\pi\), then divide the result by \(180\).</p>

<h2 id="the-sine-and-the-cosine">The sine and the cosine</h2>

<p>We can define \(\sin\) and \(\cos\) in relationship to <em>The Unit Circle</em>:</p>



<ul>
  <li>\(\theta\) is the angle formed by the radius, \(r\) and the \(x\) axis, at every given point.</li>
  <li>The \(\sin\) function represents the \(y\)-coordinate of a point on the <em>Unit Circle</em>;</li>
  <li>The \(\cos\) function is the \(x\)-coordinate of the same point on the <em>Unit Circle</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>\(\sin\) and \(\cos\) are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_function"><em>periodic functions</em></a> with the period \(2\pi\).</p>



<p>At this point, it will be unfair for \(\cos\) not to plot it on the same graph:</p>



<h2 id="the-cos-leads-the-sin">The \(\cos\) leads the \(\sin\)</h2>

<p>Putting \(\cos\) and \(\sin\) side by side, we observe that they are not that different:</p>

\[\sin(x+\frac{\pi}{2})=\cos(x)\]

<p>We say that \(\cos\) leads the \(\sin\) with \(\frac{\pi}{2}\):</p>



<h2 id="the-parity-of-cos-and-sin">The parity of \(\cos\) and \(\sin\)</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_and_odd_functions"><em>parity</em> of mathematical functions</a> generally refers to whether a function is <em>even</em>, <em>odd</em>, or <em>neither</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>cosine</em> is <em>even</em>, meaning \(\cos(x)=\cos(-x)\):</p>



<p>And the <em>sine</em> is odd, meaning \(\sin(-x)=-\sin(x)\), or \(\sin(x)=-\sin(-x)\):</p>



<h2 id="complex-numbers-and-the-unit-circle">Complex Numbers and the Unit Circle</h2>

<p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane">Complex Plane</a>, the points on the circle are defined by the following equation:</p>

\[z=\cos(\theta)+i*\sin(\theta)\]



<h2 id="multiplying-with-i-means-a-rotation-with-fracpi2">Multiplying with \(i\) means a rotation with \(\frac{\pi}{2}\)</h2>

<p>Multiplying a <em>complex number</em> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit">imaginary unit</a> \(i\) is the equivalent of rotating the number counterclockwise with \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) on an ‚Äúimaginary circle‚Äù with the radius: \(r=\mid a + b*i \mid=\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\)</p>

<p>For example, if we take \(z_{1} \in \mathbb{C}\) and we multiply it three times with \(i\) we will have it <em>rotated</em> into the all 4 quadrants of the circle:</p>



<h2 id="eulers-identity">Euler‚Äôs identity</h2>

<p>The natural exponential function, often denoted as \(f(x)=e^{x}\), is a particular case of the exponential function where the base is \(e\), also known as <em>Euler‚Äôs Number</em> (\(e \approx 2.71828\)).</p>

<p>\(e\), just like \(\pi\), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number">irrational</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number">transcendental</a>.</p>

<p>We normally define \(e\) as:</p>

\[e=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(\frac{1}{n!})=\frac{1}{0!} + \frac{1}{1!}+\frac{1}{2!}+...\]

\[e=\lim_{x \to \infty}(1+\frac{1}{x})^x\]

\[e=\lim_{x \to 0}(x+1)^{\frac{1}{x}}\]

<p>Even if not obvious, there‚Äôs a strong connection between \(e\) and the circle.</p>

<p>The <em>natural exponentiation</em> function is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenfunction"><em>eigenfunction</em></a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative">differentiation</a>.</p>

<p>An eigenfunction in this context is a function that, when differentiated, yields a constant multiple of itself:</p>

\[\frac{d}{dx} e^{ax} = a * e^{x}\]

<p>If we substitute \(a \rightarrow e\), by subsequently differentiating \(f(x) = e^{ix}\), we obtain:</p>

\[\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = \frac{d}{dx} (e^{ix}) = i * e^{ix}\]

\[\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f(x) = \frac{d^2}{dx^2} (e^{ix}) = \frac{d}{dx} (i * e^{ix}) = -e^{ix}\]

\[\frac{d^3}{dx^3}f(x) = \frac{d^3}{dx^3} (e^{ix}) = \frac{d}{dx} (-e^{ix}) = -i * e^{ix}\]

\[\frac{d^4}{dx^4}f(x) = \frac{d^4}{dx^4} (e^{ix}) = \frac{d}{dx} (-i*e^{ix}) = e^{ix} = f(x)\]

<p>In simple terms, after we differentiate \(f(x)\) four times (\(f'(x), f''(x), f'''(x), f''''(x)\)), our function does a <em>full circle</em>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs the same pattern described in the previous section when we multiplied our \(z_{1}\) with \(i\).</p>

<p>Subsequently deriving \(e^{ix}\) is the equivalent of subsequently multiplying \(e^{ix}\) with \(i\). Multiplying a complex number with \(i\) means <em>rotating</em> that number in the <em>Complex Plane</em> with \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).</p>

<p>But what is a derivative of a function at a certain point?</p>

<p>It‚Äôs the rate of change of that function at that particular point. But we‚Äôve just said that the derivative of \(e^{ix}\) is equivalent to a <em>rotation</em>.</p>

<p>So, the rate of change is rotational.</p>

<p>We can intuitively <em>feel</em> that the function \(e^{ix}\) describes an actual circle.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs no other possible solution. So we can boldly affirm that \(e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i*\sin(x)\) (which is the formula discovered by Euler).</p>

<p>Of course, this is not a rigorous demonstration. One can prove Euler‚Äôs identity using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor Series</a>.</p>

<h2 id="eulers-formula-the-connection-between-e-pi-and-i">Euler‚Äôs formula, the connection between \(e\), \(\pi\) and \(i\)</h2>

<p>Euler‚Äôs formula is a thing of marvel:</p>

\[e^{ix}=\cos(x) + i * \sin(x)\]

<p>Or, if we choose \(x=\pi\):</p>

\[e^{i\pi}+1=0\]

<h2 id="the-sin-and-cos-in-their-exponential-form">The \(\sin\) and \(\cos\) in their exponential form</h2>

<p>By substituting \(x \rightarrow -x\) into Euler‚Äôs identity we obtain:</p>

\[e^{-ix}=\cos(x)-i*\sin(x)\]

<p>If we add/subtract the two equalities, we will obtain the definition of the sine and cosine functions in their exponential form:</p>

\[\cos(x) = \frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2}\]

\[\sin(x) = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2*i}\]

<p>All points of the circle are determined by a functon \(z(x)\), where:</p>

\[z(x)=e^{ix}=\underbrace{\cos(x)}_{Re(x)}+\underbrace{i*\sin(x)}_{Im(x)}\]

<p>\(x\) represents the actual angle \(\theta \in \mathbb{R}\), so \(z(\theta)=e^{i\theta}=cos(\theta)+i*sin(\theta)\).</p>

<p>You‚Äôve seen that we‚Äôve interchanged \(x\) with \(t\) and \(\theta\) throughout the article. It‚Äôs confusing, but don‚Äôt get confused. We are the ones to decide how to look at \(x\), as an angle or as time.</p>

<h2 id="the-sinusoid">The sinusoid</h2>

<p>A <em>sinusoid</em>, or a <em>sine wave</em>, is a smooth, repetitive curve defined by following function:</p>

\[y(t) = A * \sin(2\pi ft + \varphi) = A * \sin(\omega t + \varphi)\]

<ul>
  <li>\(A\) is called the <em>amplitude</em>, representing the maximum deviation of the function from zero.</li>
  <li>\(f\) is called <em>ordinary frequency</em> and denotes the number of oscillations (the radius moving inside the circle) occurring each second.</li>
  <li>\(\omega=2\pi f\) is called the <em>angular frequency</em>; it‚Äôs the same thing as <em>ordinary frequency</em>, but we measure it \(\frac{radians}{second}\);</li>
  <li>\(\varphi\) is called <em>phase offset</em>; it‚Äôs measured in radians.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we consider <em>time</em> to be the \(x\)-axis, and \(y(t)\) the \(y\)-axis, the sinusoid becomes:</p>

\[y=f(x)=A * \sin(\omega x + \varphi)\]

<p>The \(\sin\) and \(\cos\) are just particular cases of sinusoids.</p>

<h2 id="sinusoids-are-flexible">Sinusoids are <em>flexible</em></h2>

<p>The following animation is interactive. You can choose the values of \(A=\) 
    
    , \(\omega=\)
         
    and \(\varphi=\) 
     
    to plot the sinusoid (if you pick \(\varphi=\frac{\pi}{2}\) a cosine is plotted):</p>



<h2 id="sinusoids-can-be-complex">Sinusoids can be complex</h2>

<p>Starting with the definition of a sinusoid:</p>

\[y(t) = A * sin(2\pi ft + \varphi) = A * sin(\omega t + \varphi)\]

<p>If we multiply each side with \(A\):</p>

\[A*e^{i\theta}=A*(\cos(\theta)+i*\sin(\theta))\]

<p>If we substitute \(\theta\) with \(\theta=\omega t + \varphi\) we obtain the complex sinusoid:</p>

\[s(t)=A*e^{i(\omega t + \varphi)} = A * \cos(\underbrace{\omega t + \varphi}_{\theta}) + i * A * \sin(\underbrace{\omega t + \varphi}_{\theta})\]

<p>A <em>complex sinusoid</em> captures the behavior of two sinusoids (one cosine and one sine) on both its axes; on the real part, it behaves like a cosine, while on its imaginary part, it behaves like a sine.</p>

<p>The two are <em>in sync</em> as they both depend on the free variable \(\theta\), expressed as \(\theta=\omega t + \varphi\).</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/threedcomplex.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>Two interesting observations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If we project the complex sinusoid on the plane determined by the Y-axis and Z-axis, we will plot a <em>sine</em> (the Imaginary part);</li>
  <li>If we project the complex sinusoid on the plane determined by the X-axis and Z-axis, we will plot a <em>cosine</em> (the Real part);</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sinusoids-can-nullify-themselves">Sinusoids can nullify themselves</h2>

<p>Two sinusoids in phase and sharing the same amplitude but with opposite frequencies nullify themselves.</p>



<h2 id="adding-sinusoids-leads-to-complexity">Adding sinusoids leads to complexity</h2>

<p>Let‚Äôs plot two arbitrary selected sinusoids \(y_{1}(x)\) and \(y_{2}(x)\), where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(y_{1}(x) = \frac{9}{10} * sin(7x + \frac{\pi}{2})\), and</li>
  <li>\(y_{2}(x) = \frac{12}{10} * sin(3x - 2)\) .</li>
</ul>

<p>The sum \(y(x)=y_{1}(x) + y_{2}(x)\) shows an interesting pattern</p>



<h2 id="adding-random-sinusoids-for-fun">Adding random sinusoids for fun</h2>

<p>Adding more sinusoids to an existing one (\(A=1\), \(\omega=1\), \(\varphi=1\)) generate more complex patterns:</p>



<h2 id="playing-sinusoidal-tetris-for-fun">Playing Sinusoidal tetris for fun</h2>

<p>Not so long ago, <a href="https://www.andreinc.net/2024/02/06/the-sinusoidal-tetris">I‚Äôve re-imagined the game of Tetris</a>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs now possible to play Tetris with Sinusoids:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.andreinc.net/2024/02/06/the-sinusoidal-tetris"><img src="https://www.andreinc.net/assets/images/2024-04-08-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/sinusoida-tetris.png" alt="img"></a></p>

<h2 id="a-square-wave-and-sinusoids">A square wave and sinusoids</h2>

<p>If we carefully choose the sinusoids, we can create <em>predictable</em> patterns:</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs take, for example, use the following formula:</p>

\[y(x) = \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(2\pi(2k-1)fx)}{2k-1}\]

<p>Through expansion, the formula becomes:</p>

\[y(x) =  \underbrace{\frac{4}{\pi}\sin(\omega x)}_{y_{1}(x)} + \underbrace{\frac{4}{3\pi}\sin(3\omega x)}_{y_{2}(x)} + ... + \underbrace{\frac{4}{(2k-1)\pi}{\sin((2k-1)\omega x)}}_{y_k(x)} + ...\]

<p>\(y_1(x), y_2(x), y_3(x), ..., y_k(x), ...\) are all the individual sinusoids.</p>

<p>If we perform the sum, we will create a <em>square wave</em>. The more sinusoids we pick, the better the approximation.</p>

<p>Please choose how many sinusoids you want to use, and let‚Äôs see how the functions look like for  (and \(\omega\)=):</p>



<h2 id="epicycles---first-encounter">Epicycles - First Encounter</h2>

<p>One sinusoid has a corresponding circle that <em>spins</em>. So, the above animation can be re-imagined like this:</p>

<p>Pick  and \(\omega\)= to plot the circles and the corresponding \(y_k(x)\) functions:</p>



<h2 id="epicycles---an-intuitive-understanding">Epicycles - An intuitive understanding</h2>

<p>There‚Äôs an intuitive proof to this: each epicycle corresponds to a specific sinusoid; when we talk about combining the sinusoids, we are talking about summing their positions at each point in time, and eventually, this operation reduces to subsequent vector additions.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs take a simple example by introducing three arbitrarily picked sinusoids and their associated <em>point vectors</em> (or <em>position vectors</em>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(y_{1}(x)=1.4sin(x + 1)\), with the associated position vector \(\vec{u_{1}}\);</li>
  <li>\(y_{2}(x)=0.8sin(2*x)\), with the associated position vector \(\vec{u_{2}}\);</li>
  <li>\(y_{3}(x)=0.5sin(3*x)\), with the associated position vector \(\vec{u_{3}}\).</li>
</ul>

<p>Their sum is \(y(x) = y_{1}(x) + y_{2}(x) + y_{3}(x) = 1.4sin(x + 1) + =0.8sin(2*x) + 0.5sin(3*x)\).</p>

<p>A position vector represents the displacement from the origin \((0, 0)\) to a specific point in space. In our case, the vector \((x, y_{k}(x))\) represents the position or location of a point on the graph of the function(s) \(y_{k}(x)\) at a particular \(x\) value.</p>

<p>If we plot \(y(x)\) on the cartesian grid we obtain something like:</p>



<p>At each given point \(x\), we can say for certain that \(\vec{u} = \vec{u_{1}} + \vec{u_{2}} + \vec{u_{3}}\).</p>

<h2 id="epicycles---a-flower">Epicycles - A flower</h2>

<p>If we carefully pick the <em>right sinusoids</em> the moving circles can describe (approximate) any shape we want.</p>

<p>Here is a flower for example:</p>



<p>Can you guess the individual sinusoids working together to draw the flower?</p>

<p>You probably can‚Äôt unless you apply methods from a branch of mathematics called <em>Fourier Analysis</em>.</p>

<h2 id="fourier-series">Fourier Series</h2>

<p><em>Fourier Series</em> is the mathematical process through which we expand a periodic function of period \(P\) as a sum of trigonometric functions.</p>

<p>Do you remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd">Pink Floyd‚Äôs</a> album cover for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon"><em>Dark Side of The Moon</em></a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.andreinc.net/assets/images/2023-07-02-painting-with-circles/darksideofthemoon.jpg" alt="img"></p>

<p>Imagine our function \(f(x)\) is the light itself, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_(optics)">the prism</a> is essentially <em>Fourier Mathematics</em>, and the spectral colors emanating from the prism are the sinusoids.</p>

<p>Following the analogy the formula looks like this:</p>

\[\underbrace{f(x)}_{\text{ light itself}}=\underbrace{A_{0} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} [A_{n} cos(\frac{2\pi nx}{P}) + B_{n} sin(\frac{2\pi nx}{P})]}_{\text{the spectral components}}\]

<p>Where \(A_{n}\) and \(B_{n}\) are called <em>Fourier Coefficients</em> are defined by the following integrals:</p>

\[A_{0} = \frac{1}{P} \int_{- \frac{P}{2}}^{+\frac{P}{2}} f(x) dx\]

\[A_{n} = \frac{2}{P} \int_{- \frac{P}{2}}^{+ \frac{P}{2}} f(x) * \cos(\frac{2\pi nx}{P}) dx\]

\[B_{n} = \frac{2}{P} \int_{- \frac{P}{2}}^{+ \frac{P}{2}} f(x) * \sin(\frac{2\pi nx}{P}) dx\]

<h2 id="fourier-series-in-exponential-form">Fourier Series in Exponential Form</h2>

<p>With the help of Euler‚Äôs Formula and by changing the sine and cosine functions in their exponential forms, we can also express the Fourier Series of a function as a sum of <em>Complex Sinusoids</em>:</p>

\[f(x) = \sum_{n=-N}^{N} C_{n} e ^ {i2\pi \frac{n}{P}x}\]

<p>Where:</p>

\[C_{n} = \begin{cases}
            A_{0} &amp; \text{if } n = 0 \\
            \frac{1}{2} (A_{n} - i * B_{n}) &amp;  \text{if } n &gt; 0 \\
            \frac{1}{2} (A_{n} + i * B_{n}) &amp; \text{if } n &lt; 0 \\
        \end{cases}\]

<p>If we do additional substitutions, the final form of \(C_{n}\) is:</p>

\[C_{n} = \frac{1}{P} \int_{-\frac{P}{2}}^{\frac{P}{2}} e^{-i2\pi\frac{n}{P}x} f(x) dx\]

<h2 id="example-the-fourier-series-for-the-box-function">Example: The Fourier Series for the Box Function</h2>

<p>Remember the <em>Square Wave</em> we‚Äôve approximated with sinusoids <a href="#adding-sinusoids">in this section</a>? At that point, we used the following formula to express the <em>Square</em> as a sum of sinusoidal components:</p>

\[y(x) = \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(2\pi(2k-1)fx)}{2k-1}\]

<p>Or, to keep things simpler, by substituting \(\omega=2\pi f\) (\(\omega\) is the angular frequency):</p>

\[y(x) = \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin((2k-1)\omega x)}{2k-1}\]

<p>It‚Äôs time to understand how we‚Äôve devised such an approximation.</p>

<p>In <em>isolation</em>, the <em>Square Wave</em>, \(f(x)\) looks like this:</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/squarewavef.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>Throughout the interval  <code>[0, 2L]</code>, \(f(x)\) can be written as:</p>

\[f(x) = 2 [H(\frac{x}{L})-H(\frac{x}{L}-1)] - 1\]

<p>Where \(H(x)\) is called the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HeavisideStepFunction.html"><em>Heavisde Step Function</em></a> and has the following definition:</p>

\[H(x) =  \begin{cases}
        0 &amp; \text{if } x \lt 0 \\
        1 &amp; \text{if } x \ge 0 \\
        \end{cases}\]

<p>First of all, let‚Äôs look at \(A_{0} = \frac{1}{2L} \int_{0}^{2L} f(x) dx\). Notice how we‚Äôve changed the interval from \([-\frac{P}{2}, \frac{P}{2}]\) to \([0, 2L]\) to match our example. This will be reflected in the formulas.</p>

<p>Well, this coefficient (\(A_{0}\)) is a fancy way to express the average of \(f(x)\) over the interval (in our case <code>[0, 2L]</code>). In the same time \(A_{0}\) is the area determined by \(f(x)\) over <code>[0, 2L]</code> then divided by \(2L\). But if you look at the plot again, you will see that the net area is  \(0\), because the green area (S1) nullifies the red area (S2), regardless of \(L\).</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/squarewavefa0.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>Secondly, let‚Äôs compute the \(A_{n} = \frac{1}{L} \int_{0}^{2L} f(x) * \cos(\frac{\pi nx}{L}) dx\) coefficients. An important observation is that \(f(n)\) is odd, and its average value on the interval is \(0\); we can safely say all the coefficients \(A_{n}\) also vanish.</p>

<p>Visually speaking, regardless of how you pick \(n\) or \(L\), the net area determined by the \(A_{n}\) integral will always be zero. It‚Äôs visually obvious if we <em>plot</em> \(A_n\). For example plotting \(A_{1}\), \(A_{2}\), \(A_{3}\), \(A_{4}\) looks like this:</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/squarewavean.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>Similar symmetrical patterns will emerge if you increase the \(n\) in \(A_{n}\) and plot them.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we need to compute:</p>

\[B_{n} = \frac{1}{L} \int_{0}^{2L} f(x) * \sin(\frac{\pi nx}{L}) dx\]

<p>If we plot a \(B_{1}\), \(B_{2}\), \(B_{3}\) and, let‚Äôs say, \(B_{4}\) we can intuitively <em>feel</em> what‚Äôs happening with \(B_{n}\):</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/squarewavebn.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>If you have a keen eye for geometrical representations, you will notice that every even \(B_{n}\) is also 0. The red and green areas nullify, so the net area described by the integral is \(0\). The odd terms will be \(2 * \text{something}\), so let‚Äôs calculate that \(\text{something}\).</p>

<p>We will need to split the integral on two sub-intervals \([0, L]\) and \([L, 2L]\) (there‚Äôs a <em>chasm</em> at \(L\)), but given the fact \(f(x)\) and \(sin(x)\) are odd, \(B_{n}\) can we written as:</p>

\[B_{n} = 2 * [\frac{1}{L} \int_{0}^{L} f(x) * \sin(\frac{\pi nx}{L}) dx]\]

<p>We can now perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution">u-substition</a>, so we can write:</p>

\[B_{n} = \frac{2}{L} \int_{0}^{nL\pi} \frac{\sin(\frac{u}{L})}{n\pi}du\]

<p>After we take the constant out, we compute the integral, use the intervals, and take into consideration the periodicity of cosine:</p>

\[B_{n} = \frac{2}{n\pi}(1-(-1)^n)\]

<p>And now we see it, \(B_{n}\) is exactly \(0\) if \(n\) is even, and \(B_{n}=2 * \frac{2}{n\pi}\) is \(n\) is odd.</p>

<p>Putting all back into the master formula of the <em>Fourier Series</em>:</p>

\[f(x)=\underbrace{A_{0}}_{0} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} [\underbrace{A_{n} \cos(\frac{\pi nx}{L})}_{0} + B_{n} \sin(\frac{\pi nx}{L})]\]

<p>Things become:</p>

\[f(x)=\frac{4}{\pi} \sum_{n=1,3,5...}^{+\infty} (\frac{1}{n} * \sin(\frac{\pi nx}{L}))\]

<p>If we substitute \(n \rightarrow 2k-1\) and consider, we obtain the initial formula:</p>

\[f(x)=\frac{4}{\pi} \sum_{k=1}^{+\infty} (\frac{\sin(\frac{\pi (2k-1)x}{L})}{(2k-1)})\]

<p>To obtain the initial formula, we substitute \(L \rightarrow \frac{1}{2f}\), and \(2\pi f \rightarrow \omega\), basically we create an interdependence between \(L\) (half of the interval) and \(\omega\), \(L=\frac{\pi}{\omega}\):</p>

\[f(x) = \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin((2k-1)\omega x)}{2k-1}\]

<p>Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no way we can go to \(+\infty\), so let‚Äôs consider \(s(x)\) as an approximation of \(f(x)\) that depends on \(n\).</p>

\[s(x) = \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{\sin((2k-1)\omega x)}{2k-1} \approx f(x)\]

<p>In the next animation, you will see that by increasing \(n\), the accuracy of our approximation gets better and better, and the <em>gaps</em> are slowly closed:</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/tightfourier.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>To understand how adding more coefficients improves the approximation, let‚Äôs look back again at a few of our coefficients \(s_{1}(x)\), \(s_{2}(x)\), \(s_{3}(x)\), \(s_{4}(x)\) and \(s_{5}(x)\) (we will pick \(\omega=\frac{\pi}{2}\), so that \(2L=1\)):</p>

\[s_{1}(x) = \frac{4}{\pi} \sin(\frac{\pi x}{2})\]

\[s_{2}(x) = \frac{4}{3\pi} \sin(\frac{3\pi x}{2})\]

\[s_{3}(x) = \frac{4}{5\pi} \sin(\frac{5\pi x}{2})\]

\[s_{4}(x) = \frac{4}{7\pi} \sin(\frac{7\pi x}{2})\]

\[s_{5}(x) = \frac{4}{9\pi} \sin(\frac{9\pi x}{2})\]

<p>Each of the 5 terms is a sinusoid, with \(\frac{4}{\pi}\), \(\frac{4}{3\pi}\), etc. amplitudes, and \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), \(\frac{3\pi}{2}\), etc. frequencies.</p>

<p>So, if we were to approximate a <em>Square Wave</em> with its fifth partial sum (the red dot), we would obtain something like this:</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/tightfourieravg.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>Notice how <em>obsessed</em> the <em>red dot</em> is with the <em>blue dot</em> (the actual function) and how closely it follows it.</p>

<p>We can always add more terms to the partial sum to help the <em>red dot</em> in its <em>holy mission</em>, improving the approximation until nobody cares anymore.</p>

<h2 id="example---the-fourier-series-of-the-triangle-wave">Example - The Fourier Series of the Triangle wave</h2>

<p>Without dealing with all the associated math, the <em>Fourier Series</em> decomposition for a triangle-wave is:</p>

\[s(x)=\frac{8}{\pi^2}\sum_{k=1}^{N}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{(2k-1)^2}*\sin((2k-1)x)\]

<p>Plotting the function \(s(x)\), we will see that things converge smoothly and fast. As soon as \(n\) approaches \(6\), we can already observe the triangle:</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/tighttriangle.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>Let‚Äôs compute the first terms six terms of the \(\sum\), so that:</p>

\[s(x) \approx s_1(x) + s_2(x) + s_3(x) + s_4(x) + s_5(x) + s_6(x)\]

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first term is \(s_1(x)=\frac{8}{\pi^2}*\sin(x)\), where \(A=\frac{8}{\pi^2}\), \(\omega=1\), \(\varphi=0\);</li>
  <li>The second term is \(s_2(x)=-\frac{8}{3^2\pi^2}*\sin(3x)\), where \(A=-\frac{8}{3^2\pi^2}\), \(\omega=3\), \(\varphi=0\);</li>
  <li>The third term is \(s_3(x)=\frac{8}{5^2\pi^2}*\sin(5x)\), where \(A=\frac{8}{5^2\pi^2}\), \(\omega=5\), \(\varphi=0\);</li>
  <li>The fourth term is \(s_4(x)=-\frac{8}{7^2\pi^2}*\sin(7x)\), where \(A=-\frac{8}{7^2\pi^2}\), \(\omega=7\), \(\varphi=0\);</li>
  <li>The fifth term is \(s_5(x)=\frac{8}{9^2\pi^2}*\sin(9x)\), where \(A=\frac{8}{9^2\pi^2}\), \(\omega=9\), \(\varphi=0\);</li>
  <li>The sixth term is \(s_6(x)=-\frac{8}{11^2\pi^2}*\sin(11x)\), where \(A=-\frac{8}{11^2\pi^2}\), \(\omega=11\), \(\varphi=0\);</li>
</ul>

<p>A keen eye will see will observe the that \(s_2(x)\), \(s_4(x)\), \(s_6(x)\) and all the even terms are <em>negative</em>.</p>

<p>A negative amplitude doesn‚Äôt make too much sense, at least not in a physical sense. What are we going to do with the <em>minus sign</em>?</p>

<p>We have two options:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Because \(\sin(-x)=-\sin(x)\), nobody stops us to make the <em>frequency</em> negative. For example, \(s_2(x)=\frac{8}{3^2\pi^2}*\sin(-3x)\), so that the \(\omega=-3\). But again, why would we want a <em>negative frequency</em>? This also doesn‚Äôt make sense in a physical sense.</li>
  <li>We can use \(\vert A \vert\) and shift the signal with \(\pi\), so that \(\varphi=\pi\).</li>
</ol>

<p>In practice, we will go with 2. as it‚Äôs more practical and gives us more control, but the two options are equivalent so that we can write \(s_2(x)\) in both ways:</p>

\[s_2(x)=-\frac{8}{3^2\pi^2}*\sin(3x)\]

\[s_2(x)=\frac{8}{3^2\pi^2}*\sin(3x + \pi)\]

<p>Visually speaking, the results will not be surprising if we plot \(sin(-x)\) and \(sin(x+\pi)\) side by side; the two are equivalent:</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/pishift.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>If we consider this, the even terms of \(s(x)\) will become:</p>

<ul>
  <li>\(s_2(x)=\frac{8}{3^2\pi^2}*sin(3x+\pi)\) ;</li>
  <li>\(s_4(x)=\frac{8}{7^2\pi^2}*sin(7x+\pi)\) ;</li>
  <li>\(s_6(x)=\frac{8}{11^2\pi^2}*sin(11x+\pi)\) ;</li>
  <li>‚Ä¶and so on</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example---the-fourier-series-of-a-sawtooth-function">Example - The Fourier Series of a Sawtooth Function</h2>

<p>Shamelessly skipping the math demonstration, a reverse-sawtooth function has the following form:</p>

\[s(x)=\frac{2}{\pi}\sum_{k=1}^{N}(-1)^k*\frac{\sin(kx)}{k}\]

<p>Plotting \(s(x)\), while increasing \(n\), things look like this:</p>

<h2 id="the-fourier-series-machinery">The Fourier Series Machinery</h2>

<p>To better visualize what‚Äôs happening, let‚Äôs look at a <em>Fourier Series Machinery</em> and how the <em>circles move</em> to create <em><del>beautiful</del> practical patterns</em>.</p>

<p>You can pick the shape of the desired signal from here:  and the sketch will change accordingly.</p>

<p>‚Ä¶A bunch of spinning circles on a stick, where each circle corresponds to exactly one term of the series - this is the marvelous <em>Fourier Series Machinery</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.andreinc.net/assets/images/2023-07-02-painting-with-circles/fmachinery.jpg" alt="img"></p>

<p>If we run our signal through the <em>Fourier Series Machinery</em>, we will obtain <em>The Amplitude</em> (\(A\)) and <em>The Phase</em> (\(\varphi\)) for each Frequency (\(\omega\)) from \(1\) to \(N\). Isn‚Äôt it amazing? And it all comes down to a bunch of spinning circles‚Ä¶ on a stick.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>I‚Äôve been putting content on the internet for all of my adult life. The works ranged from security research, to open-source projects, to long-term writing on a variety of topics. In an </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/you-should-write-more" rel="">earlier article</a><span>, I extolled the virtues of publishing just for the sake of it:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>‚ÄúThe concepts in our heads are nebulous and ever-shifting. Putting them on paper forces us to pressure-test our assumptions and address gaps.</em></p><p><em>You don‚Äôt need to be the world‚Äôs leading expert to write about a particular topic. Experts are often busy and struggle to explain concepts in an accessible way. You should be honest with yourself and with your readers about what you know and don‚Äôt know ‚Äî but otherwise, it‚Äôs OK to write about what excites you, and to do it as you learn.‚Äù</em></p></blockquote><p>For over two decades, I resisted the desire to monetize my side projects. Part of it was pragmatic: my career paid better than what I could realistically make by cramming ads into articles or selling geeky books. But just as important, I didn‚Äôt want to turn a hobby into yet another chore.</p><p>Today, I‚Äôd like to share some of the less obvious takeaways from the journey so far.</p><p>By refusing to monetize, you give up most of the tangible upsides of online publishing ‚Äî but the downsides stay with you either way. In the long haul, you should expect to spend as much time putting out fires and wrangling the technology as you spend on creative pursuits.</p><p>To give you a taste, I had my website randomly delisted by Google, hijacked by SEO spammers in Bing, repeatedly flagged by antivirus tools, and hit with bogus abuse and copyright claims; in each case, it took weeks to get it sorted out, often having to lean on informal connections to get through.</p><p>When I self-hosted, I had to deal with endless configuration and maintenance tasks ‚Äî and at one point, an outright server compromise. Third-party hosting is easier until it isn‚Äôt. For example, it took me nearly a year to get this rendering issue fixed by Substack:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd99ae74d-3a0c-4895-974d-d0698eb15bed_1168x520.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd99ae74d-3a0c-4895-974d-d0698eb15bed_1168x520.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd99ae74d-3a0c-4895-974d-d0698eb15bed_1168x520.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd99ae74d-3a0c-4895-974d-d0698eb15bed_1168x520.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd99ae74d-3a0c-4895-974d-d0698eb15bed_1168x520.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd99ae74d-3a0c-4895-974d-d0698eb15bed_1168x520.jpeg" width="1168" height="520" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d99ae74d-3a0c-4895-974d-d0698eb15bed_1168x520.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:520,&quot;width&quot;:1168,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:180087,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd99ae74d-3a0c-4895-974d-d0698eb15bed_1168x520.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd99ae74d-3a0c-4895-974d-d0698eb15bed_1168x520.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd99ae74d-3a0c-4895-974d-d0698eb15bed_1168x520.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd99ae74d-3a0c-4895-974d-d0698eb15bed_1168x520.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>How Substack used to display math on this blog.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Their support was of no help; what finally worked was a ‚Äúcold‚Äù email to one of the site‚Äôs founders. In other words, it took perseverance and luck.</p><p><span>Even with free hosting, you need a job to pay the bills. I poured thousands of dollars into this craft, and I‚Äôm sure the same goes for most other habitual content producers you come across. The costs range from photo and video gear, to software licenses, to the procurement of </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/a-brief-history-of-counting-stuff" rel="">antique calculating machines</a><span> and </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/comparing-hobby-pcb-vendors" rel="">random PCBs</a><span>.</span></p><p>Unless you‚Äôre a pop star, you are unlikely to gain devoted fans who follow you around. Most of the time, when we come across helpful content on the internet, we don‚Äôt think much of the stranger who put it out there. We just take the experience for granted and move on.</p><p>Online hate isn‚Äôt so fleeting. Sooner or later, you come across a heckler who follows you around and makes it their life‚Äôs mission to ‚Äúdebunk‚Äù your claims ‚Äî or simply hurl insults in your general direction without any pretense of being constructive.</p><p>This seems worse than it really is. Putting others down on the internet is a pretty miserable hobby ‚Äî often just a way for the other person to cope with their own insecurities and stress.  But still, early on, it plays tricks with your mind ‚Äî what if I‚Äôm really as clueless as they say?</p><p><span>If your content upsets another person, it still means you have an audience. More often than not, the controversy pulls in bystanders and lets them make up their own minds. There </span><em>is</em><span> such a thing as bad press, but on the internet, the threshold is pretty high.</span></p><p><span>What stings far more is when you get no reaction whatsoever: all of sudden, the content‚Äôs most important </span><em>raison d'etre</em><span> is lost. Few bloggers or vloggers quit because of the occasional snide remark; many give up when their metrics don‚Äôt budge post after post.</span></p><p><span>The process of building an online audience is slow and unpredictable, so my best advice is to pick a platform that doesn‚Äôt rub your nose in it. I‚Äôve previously written about my </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/youtube-is-hell" rel="">special dislike of YouTube</a><span>, where the entire creator experience revolves around view counts:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>‚ÄúThe complexity of the medium is not YouTube‚Äôs fault. What I fault them for, however, is that they deliberately thrust authors into a global popularity contest ‚Äî and offer no reprieve. You can use Reddit, Twitter, or Facebook to hang out with friends without knowing who‚Äôs the highest-ranking influencer of the week. On YouTube, view counts are all there is ‚Äî inescapable and in-your-face.</em></p><p><em><strong>[A thumbnail of a woman flipping off an Alaskan malamute, 82M views]</strong></em></p><p><em>Even in the privacy of your own channel, you‚Äôre being compared: to the right of your video, you see similar clips from strangers, along with their scores. The takeaway is simple: there must be something wrong with you if you can‚Äôt compete with a person flipping off their dog.‚Äù</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Most social media platforms use </span><em>algorithmic feeds</em><span> ‚Äî that is, they decide what to show not based on their users‚Äô explicit preferences, but on what‚Äôs most likely to elicit a response and keep the user engaged. Because of this, follower counts are fairly meaningless: just because a person follows you on Instagram or Facebook, it doesn‚Äôt mean they will ever see your posts.</span></p><p>To be fair, the platform you‚Äôre reading this on ‚Äî Substack ‚Äî is a bit of an outlier. They deliver every post via email, so if a subscriber is still alive and the mails are not ending up in spam, they will see what you have to say. But for a more typical data point, let‚Äôs have a look at Twitter: I have 35k+ followers over there, but this translates to just about 1,000 to 2,000 impressions on a typical post. YouTube is the same: I notionally have 1,100 followers there, but a video that isn‚Äôt promoted elsewhere tends to get 50-100 views.</p><p>I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs any special takeaway to this ‚Äî except, if you want to build an audience around subscriptions, make sure they are real. And don‚Äôt assume that people with 100k or 1M followers have anything resembling this kind of reach.</p><p>If you ask an average person what‚Äôs corrupting the internet, they will probably point to monetization. But it‚Äôs not just about money; non-commercial content creators are getting comically distorted signals too.</p><p><span>For example, did you know that my Substack audience is telling me I should stop writing? It‚Äôs true: whenever I post a new article, I reliably lose subscribers. If you have a sufficiently large audience, there‚Äôs always someone who expected something different, and your new post nudges them to finally unsubscribe. But when I‚Äôm </span><strong>not</strong><span> posting, I quickly make up the losses with sign-ups driven through Google search.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!--[--><!--[--><div><p><i>A version of this story originally appeared in</i> <a href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/iphone-thieves-copypasta" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><i>Read Max</i></a><i>, a twice-weekly newsletter about tech, politics, culture, and media.</i></p><p>My phone was stolen in early March, most likely while I was standing on the platform at the York Street station waiting for the F train. Fifteen minutes later, in a food hall under the movie theater where my boyfriend and I were supposed to see ‚ÄúDune 2,‚Äù I reached into my pocket and realized it was gone. He looked at the Find My app on his phone: My phone was ‚Äúlast seen‚Äù at York Street but wasn‚Äôt registering a current location. Someone had turned it off.</p><p>As quickly as possible, I did <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/101593" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all the things you‚Äôre supposed to do when your phone is lost or stolen</a> ‚Äî- mark it as lost, cut off service, and remotely erase it. I spent the rest of the night anxiously refreshing the Find My app, watching my phone move around Manhattan before it finally stopped at Rockefeller Center. I didn‚Äôt bother confronting the thief. Worst of all, we didn't even see ‚ÄúDune 2.‚Äù</p><p>After two hours in the Williamsburg Apple Store the next morning, I had a new iPhone 15 and I stopped stressing. As long as I didn‚Äôt remove the phone from my Apple account or the Find My app, the phone was essentially bricked to anyone without the passcode <i>and</i> my iCloud password ‚Äî unusable by the thieves, or the fences who I assume bought it from them. Now my phone was their problem.</p><p>Where had my phone gone? I learned (from Reddit comments ‚Äì where else?) that stolen iPhones usually end up sold in bulk online, either directly by the thief or by a fence who buys stolen phones individually and <i>then</i> sells them in bulk. The purchasers are either <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/fw7s3v/my_experience_with_liquidationcom/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">looking for parts</a> or think they can crack into the phones, wipe and resell them. This teenager on YouTube, for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26bdjJqWdCo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bought a box of stolen iPhones</a> for $1,300 on Liquidation.com:</p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>

</p>
</div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>As you can see, most of the phones she tried didn‚Äôt have passcodes but were still linked to iCloud accounts, which meant she (or anyone buying the phones) still had access to all of the original owners‚Äô texts, emails and photos. She sent a message to each iCloud email offering to give people their phones back, but only one guy replied.</p><p>I, sadly, did not get a message from a teenage YouTuber earnestly offering to return my stolen phone. Instead I received a series of texts from someone cycling through a number of different strategies for engaging, convincing, tricking or scaring me into unlocking the phone for them.</p><p>Rather than being engaged, convinced, tricked or scared, however, I was delighted. The experience managed to combine the internet's promises of international communion and international crime.</p><p>There was something oddly soothing about being in touch with the people who‚Äôd stolen my phone. Instead of it disappearing into the ether, I knew more or less where it was, and thanks to these texts, I knew that it was a source of frustration to the people who‚Äôd gotten their hands on it. As the texts escalated in complexity and rage, I sympathized with their plight. I mean, not enough to unlock my phone. But we‚Äôve all been there ‚Äì sometimes you get stuck with a difficult project at work.</p><p>In case you find yourself in a similar situation, here are some things the guys who stole (or later purchased) my iPhone have told me to try to get me to unlock it.</p></div><!--]--><!--[--><p><h5><b>1) ‚ÄúYour iPhone 14 Pro is trying to pay with Apple Pay in China.‚Äù</b></h5></p><!--]--><!--[--><figure><figcaption><!----><p>The first text I received from the scammers.</p><p>Veronica de Souza/Gothamist</p></figcaption></figure><!--]--><!--[--><p>The first text I got from my new friends was sent on April 28, a few weeks after the phone was stolen, and I have to be honest ‚Ä¶ it kind of got me, at least for a second. It helped that, even though this text came from a clearly bogus iCloud email address, Apple‚Äôs own ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù iMessage feature was sort of fooled: the auto-filled contact name said ‚ÄúMaybe: Apple Pay.‚Äù Maybe!</p><!--]--><!--[--><figure><figcaption><!----><p>Apple‚Äôs own ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù iMessage feature was sort of fooled: the auto-filled contact name said ‚ÄúMaybe: Apple Pay.‚Äù Maybe!</p><p>Veronica de Souza/Gothamist</p></figcaption></figure><!--]--><!--[--><p>At this point, my phone was in Sunnyside, Queens:</p><!--]--><!--[--><figure><figcaption><!----><p>My phone was camped out in Sunnyside, Queens for a bit.</p><p>Veronica de Souza/Gothamist</p></figcaption></figure><!--]--><!--[--><p>My old phone's new owners persisted with this tactic for a while.

Two weeks after that, on May 12, I got an identical message in which ‚ÄúUSA‚Äù had been replaced with ‚ÄúChina.‚Äù I'm guessing it was intended to dial up the panic, but instead it made me feel cosmopolitan and sophisticated.</p><!--]--><!--[--><p><h5><b>2) ‚ÄúIv'e bought an iPhone 14 Pro I'm using, it have your messages, emails, cards, bank, notes and personal information on it‚Äù</b></h5></p><!--]--><!--[--><figure><figcaption><!----><p>Posing as the unwitting new owners of a stolen iPhone, the scammer continued to try to get me to unlock the phone.</p><p>Veronica de Souza/Gothamist</p></figcaption></figure><!--]--><!--[--><p>On May 13, my pen pals reached out from a Filipino phone number.

While the previous message didn‚Äôt move me much, it‚Äôs hard not to admire the arresting visuals of the detailed iPhone breakdown, the reference to ‚Äúthe law of the United States,‚Äù the mocking ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never catch me.‚Äù It‚Äôs an incredible intro that really elevates the literary value of what would otherwise be a rote bit of vaguely threatening text! ! ! ! ! !</p><p>In any event, I will credit them with being honest: I checked Find My and my phone was indeed in China.

One video showed a ‚Äúhacker‚Äù breaking into someone‚Äôs iPhone and going through their camera roll, which was a mix of selfies and graphic videos. Another appeared to be a screen recording of a social video of a man showing off his gun.

<p>Debian had a major <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/499410/">discussion</a>
about mounting <tt>/tmp</tt> as a RAM-based tmpfs in 2012 but inertia
won out in the end. Debian systems have continued to
store temporary files on disk by default. Until now. A mere 
12 years later, the project will be switching to a RAM-based <tt>/tmp</tt> in the Debian
13 ("Trixie") release. Additionally, starting with Trixie, the
default will be to periodically clean up temporary files automatically in
<tt><nobr>/tmp</nobr></tt> and <tt><nobr>/var/tmp</nobr></tt>. Naturally, it involved a lengthy discussion first.</p>

<h4>Join the party</h4>

<p>By now, using tmpfs for the <tt>/tmp</tt>
directory is a road well-traveled. Many Linux distributions have already switched to mounting
<tt>/tmp</tt> as a tmpfs. Arch Linux, Fedora, openSUSE
Tumbleweed, and many others have all made the switch. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and its
clones, as well as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) and openSUSE Leap, still default to <tt>/tmp</tt> on
disk. Ubuntu, following Debian, also continues to have a disk-based
<tt>/tmp</tt> rather than using tmpfs.</p>

<p>The knobs to control how <tt>/tmp</tt> is mounted, and the handling
of temporary files, <a href="https://systemd.io/TEMPORARY_DIRECTORIES/">are part of
systemd</a>. (On systems where systemd is used, of course.) The
upstream defaults for systemd are to mount <tt>/tmp</tt> as a tmpfs
and delete files that have not been read or changed after ten days in
<tt>/tmp</tt> and 30 days for those stored in <tt>/var/tmp</tt>.
Debian Developer and systemd contributor Luca Boccassi recently
decided it was time to revisit the topic of <tt>/tmp</tt> as a tmpfs,
and start deleting temporary files in <tt>/tmp</tt> and
<tt>/var/tmp</tt>.</p>

<p>On May 6 Boccassi
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/ebee234c6f72eb7dfe55809821c038491bfea542.camel@debian.org/">resurrected</a> a discussion from Debian's bug
tracker that started in 2020 and that had trailed off in July 2022 without resolution. The bug
was submitted by Eric Desrochers, who <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=966621#5">complained</a> that
Debian's systemd implementation did not clean <tt>/var/tmp</tt> by
default. Michael Biebl <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=966621#10">wrote</a>
that this was a deliberate choice to match Debian's pre-systemd
behavior. After a long period of inactivity, Biebl <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=966621#35">suggested</a>
in October 2021 (and <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=966621#40">again</a> in July 2022) that Desrochers raise the topic on the Debian devel
mailing list. That never happened.</p>

<p>In reviving the topic, Boccassi declared that it was time to bring Debian's defaults in
line with upstream and other Linux distributions by making
<tt>/tmp</tt> a tmpfs, and cleaning up <tt>/tmp</tt> and <tt>/var/tmp</tt> on a
timer. He planned to apply those changes in the next systemd upload to
Debian unstable within a week, with instructions in the <tt>NEWS</tt> file on
how to override the changes for any users who wanted to keep the
current behavior. That, in turn, sparked quite a discussion.</p>

<h4>The case for and against</h4>

<p>Biebl <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/abb5af73-7b68-4880-b0fc-622112bf4403@debian.org/">worried</a>
about the effect of cleaning up temporary files by default. Currently,
he said, Debian only cleans <tt>/tmp</tt> on boot (which is
unnecessary if <tt>/tmp</tt> is a RAM-based tmpfs) and to never clean
up files in <tt>/var/tmp</tt>. Boccassi <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/CAMw=ZnQuCfngAWSrZrJCXxru61EVtfsOMjw-5fFHrPQ11U4L9Q@mail.gmail.com/">answered</a>:
"<q>Defaults are defaults, they are trivially and fully overridable
where needed if needed.</q>" Biebl <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/4b514ecf-d6b1-4208-9be3-ffa3f988da32@debian.org/">replied</a>
that there is value in aligning defaults across Linux distributions,
but argued that Debian has "<q>a larger scope</q>" than a desktop
distribution like Fedora. He suggested that it was necessary to "<q>gather feedback from all affected parties 
to make an informed decision</q>". Boccassi <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/CAMw=ZnRzXjern5wD60Gb+uUmxyTk_duK8jGNND16EA3xpDPVNw@mail.gmail.com/">responded</a>
that it was impossible to have defaults that would make everyone
happy, and he was not looking for hypothetical arguments or
philosophical discussions, he wanted facts: "<q>what would
break where, and how to fix it?</q>"</p>

<p>Sam Hartman <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/tsla5l1d1kh.fsf@suchdamage.org/">noted</a>
that <tt>ssh-agent</tt> created its socket under <tt>/tmp</tt>, but it would be
better if it respected the <tt>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</tt> setting and
created its socket under <tt>/run/user</tt>. Boccassi
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/CAMw=ZnQ9TedkhqkAv-+SYV9+_rRwnxc8H7y=mUS1DgY2oV7wkw@mail.gmail.com/">agreed</a>
and said that he had <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1070725">filed a bug</a> for <tt>ssh-agent</tt>. Richard Lewis
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/86seyuk41q.fsf@simplex.rtf.org.uk/">pointed
out</a> that tmux stores its sockets in <tt>/tmp/tmux-$UID</tt>, and
deleting those files might mean users could not reattach to a tmux
session that had been idle a long time. Boccassi <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/CAMw=ZnSYrqwd5s6u1fhT1dx+W2E1Ti3Y84eWAKs9iKZN_O5=OA@mail.gmail.com/">suggested</a>
that using <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/testing/manpages-dev/flock.2.en.html"><tt>flock()</tt></a>
would be the right solution to stop the deletion, and <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/CAMw=ZnRT3OeZwZ6M=X_fLdWo5Saf6Xgn04UnS_9yywCbfjhGfg@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>
he had <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1070724">filed a bug</a> on that as well.</p>

<p>Lewis <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/86ikzpjq8k.fsf@simplex.rtf.org.uk/">questioned</a>
whether files downloaded with <tt>apt&nbsp;source</tt> might be
considered "old" when they were extracted under <tt>/tmp</tt> and
immediately flagged to be deleted. Russ Allbery <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/87cypxfgi9.fsf@hope.eyrie.org/">said</a>
that <tt>systemd-tmpfiles</tt> would respect the access timestamp (atime)
and changed timestamp (ctime), not just the modified timestamp
(mtime), "<q>so I think this would only be a problem on file systems that didn't support
those attributes</q>". Allbery said he believed tmpfs supports all three.</p>

<p>Some users store information in <tt>/var/tmp</tt> for long-running
jobs, because they want it preserved without being backed up, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/CANa01B+C2Z6o=QEv33Ovd8pDM4+MqmCZ2L4T2g4nNY4Gj13-dg@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>
Barak A. Pearlmutter. Boccassi <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/CAMw=ZnT_bYrBRm7j3iU5sN=dtzvHcf0vaRH=Xxc7xEVjQ=txWA@mail.gmail.com/">dismissed</a>
that, saying that those users "<q>assuming they actually exist</q>",
can customize the system defaults according to their needs.</p>

<p>Those users do exist, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/D14DPA7WSVOK.2LV6HCA1DS4F5@debian.org/">wrote</a>
Jonathan Dowland, "<q>[I've] been one of them, I've worked with many of
them, it's an incredibly common pattern in academic
computing</q>". Making a change to how these files are handled,
"<q>should be a very carefully explored decision</q>". He also
asked for arguments in favor of the change, and to hold off the change
to allow the discussion to continue.</p>

<p>Hartman <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/tsla5l11xl6.fsf@suchdamage.org/">wished</a>
that it was possible to specify that directories under
<tt>/var/tmp</tt> should be deleted entirely or left alone. Boccassi
said that was a reasonable enhancement request, and that it had
already been <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/CAMw=ZnRbG9EJgu1VDYCwxDYAtmwDj+UrxgxiXkxWgyqOY8UZtw@mail.gmail.com/">filed
upstream</a> for systemd.</p>

<p>Allbery eventually <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/87h6f9hev0.fsf@hope.eyrie.org/">admitted
surprise</a> at the number of people who reported using
<tt>/var/tmp</tt> "<q>for things that are clearly not temporary
files in the traditional UNIX sense</q>". Periodically deleting files
in <tt>/var/tmp</tt>, he said, has been common UNIX practice for at
least 30 years:</p>

<blockquote>
Whatever we do with /var/tmp retention, I beg people to stop using
/var/tmp for data you're keeping for longer than a few days and care about
losing.  That's not what it's for, and you *will* be bitten by this
someday, somewhere, because even with existing Debian configuration many
people run tmpreaper or similar programs.  If you are running a
long-running task that produces data that you care about, make a directory
for it to use, whether in your home directory, /opt, /srv, whatever.
</blockquote>

<p>Hakan Bayƒ±ndƒ±r <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/812a6293-c157-484e-9fc0-002692ad733a@bayindir.org/">said</a>
that he did not use <tt>/var/tmp</tt>, but applications that
other people use do. He cited a high-end scientific application that was
not under his or other users' control. Allbery argued that this
was "<q>not a good design decision</q>" but conceded that may not be
helpful if a user or admin does not have control over the
application's design. However, he said, it was "<q>playing with fire</q>"
to use <tt>/var/tmp</tt> that way "<q>and it's
going to result in someone getting their data deleted at some point,
regardless of what Debian does</q>".</p>

<p>Lewis <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/86h6f9jop1.fsf@simplex.rtf.org.uk/">said</a>
he still did not understand the rationale for the change. Was there,
he asked, "<q>perhaps something more compelling than 'other
distributions and upstream already do this'?</q>" That sounded like
the original rationale, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/878r0lffbs.fsf@hope.eyrie.org/">Allbery
said</a>, but he added that moving <tt>/tmp</tt> to tmpfs should make
applications run faster, and reaping files under <tt>/var/tmp</tt>
could help to avoid filling up a partition. Allowing the partition to
fill up, he noted, could
cause bounced mail, unstable services, and other problems. It may not
be a problem for desktop systems, which tend to have enough disk space
not to be affected, but for virtual machines that have <tt>/var/tmp</tt>
contained within a small root partition, it is still a concern.</p>

<h4>Rolling out changes</h4>

<p>In the end, none of the arguments for maintaining Debian's status
quo managed to persuade Boccassi to stay his hand. On May 28, Boccassi <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/CAMw=ZnTPEbA7uZ4Cg2sx7PBZS2_Z_8-ZD7UDqoVWq6UasAcUxA@mail.gmail.com/">announced</a>
the changes that he had made and uploaded to unstable. As expected, <tt>/tmp</tt> will become a
tmpfs by default, for both new and existing installations. New
installs will use the systemd default behavior. The
<tt>openssh</tt> and <tt>tmux</tt> packages, he said, had been fixed
to provide exceptions to retain their temporary files. A description has been added
to the Debian installer to inform users that <tt>/tmp</tt> is a tmpfs
by default, and the changes have been noted in the <tt>NEWS</tt>
file. He also offered
to review and merge any changes to the Debian installer that would let
users customize those options during installation.
Users who want <tt>/tmp</tt> to remain on disk can override the
upstream default with <tt>systemctl&nbsp;mask&nbsp;tmp.mount</tt>. To
stop periodic cleanups of <tt>/tmp</tt> and <tt>/var/tmp</tt> users
can run <tt>touch&nbsp;/etc/tmpfiles.d/tmp.conf</tt>.</p>

<p>None of the changes, it should be noted, will affect Debian
versions prior to Trixie. Users of Debian stable and oldstable will
only encounter these changes on upgrade.</p>

<p>As noted, many distributions have already made these changes
without catastrophe. Debian, and its users, should be able to adapt to
the new defaults or override them if they are unsuitable for the
workloads to be run. At worst, it promises to be a temporary
inconvenience.</p><br clear="all">

      <article>
        
              <div>
                
                  <p>Imagine a university that rewards professors based on the number of citations to their research. In response, a group of colleagues might agree to cite each other‚Äôs work in every paper they write. What would be the positive and negative effects of our imaginary citation cartel? Economists are not known for excessive citations, which could be explained by positive externalities: the citing author bears all the costs, while the cited author reaps the benefits. As citing authors can‚Äôt internalise this positive externality, we end up with fewer citations than is socially optimal.</p>

<p>A citation cartel could solve this issue via reciprocal behaviour: by the cartel agreement, members would receive as many citations as they give. However, this can go too far. If this agreement requires citing unrelated papers, it might be good for group members but lead to meaningless literature reviews. Thus, the benefit of such agreements depends on their nature: making more effort to cite related papers could be good, while citing unrelated papers is probably bad.</p>

<p>Such academic citation cartels are not purely hypothetical. Academic journals have been found to form agreements to boost each other‚Äôs journals in the rankings (Van Noorden 2013). Similarly, universities have boosted their colleagues‚Äô citation counts to advance in university rankings (Catanzaro 2024). Due to such citation patterns, Clarivate (Thomson Reuters) has excluded journals from Impact Factor listings, and most recently excluded the entire field of mathematics (Van Noorden 2013, Catanzaro 2024).</p>

<p>Academic citation cartels are difficult to study because there is no data on explicit cartel agreements. But in influencer marketing, cartel agreements are observable. In our new paper (Hinnosaar and Hinnosaar 2024), we study how influencers collude to inflate engagement and the conditions under which influencer cartels can be welfare-improving.</p>

<h2>Distorted incentives and fraudulent behaviour in influencer marketing</h2>

<p>Influencer marketing has become a key part of modern advertising. In 2023, spending on influencer marketing reached $31 billion, already rivalling the entirety of print newspaper advertising. Influencer marketing allows advertisers fine targeting based on consumer interests by choosing a good product-influencer-consumer match.</p>

<p>Many non-celebrity influencers are not paid based on the success of their marketing campaigns. In fact, less than 20% of companies track the sales induced by their influencer marketing campaigns. Instead, influencers‚Äô pay is based on impact measures such as the number of followers and engagement (likes and comments), furnishing an incentive for fraudulent behaviour ‚Äì for inflating their influence. Inflating influence is a form of advertising fraud that causes market inefficiencies by directing ads to the wrong audience. An estimated 15% of influencer marketing spending is misused due to exaggerated influence. To address this issue, the US Federal Trade Commission proposed a rule in 2023 to ban the sale and purchase of false indicators of social media influence. Cartels provide a way of obtaining fake engagement that does not fall directly under the proposed rule ‚Äì because no money changes hands ‚Äì but is still in the same spirit. While there is substantial literature on fake consumer reviews (Mayzlin et al. 2014, Luca and Zervas 2016) and other forms of advertising fraud (Zinman and Zitzewitz 2016), the literature on influencer marketing has focused mostly on advertising disclosure (Ershov and Mitchell 2023, Pei and Mayzlin 2022, Mitchell 2021, Fainmesser and Galeotti 2021), leaving the fraudulent behaviour unstudied.</p>

<h2>How do Instagram cartels work?</h2>

<p>An influencer cartel is a group of influencers who collude to boost their advertising fees by inflating engagement metrics. As in traditional industries (Steen et al. 2013), influencer cartels involve a formal agreement to manipulate the market for the members‚Äô benefit. The cartels operate in online chatrooms. The screenshots below show how one such cartel operates in practice. The image on the left is from an online chat room, where cartel members submit links to their content for extra engagement. Before submitting a link, they must reciprocate by liking and commenting on other members‚Äô posts. An algorithm enforces these rules. The image on the right shows these cartel-induced comments on Instagram. The cartel history and rules make it possible to observe which engagement (comments) originate from the cartel.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> Left panel shows posts in online chatroom submitted for cartel engagement; right panel shows Instagram comments originating from the cartel</p>

<h2>What distinguishes ‚Äòbad‚Äô from ‚Äònot-so-bad‚Äô cartels?</h2>

<p>Our theoretical model formalises the main trade-offs in this setting, in the spirit of the imaginary citation group discussed earlier. The model focuses on strategic engagement, a decision that affects social media content distribution and consumption (Aridor et al. 2024) but has been underexplored (with the exception of Filippas et al. 2023, who studied attention bartering in Twitter). Engaging with other influencers‚Äô content has a positive externality, leading to too little engagement in equilibrium. Forming a cartel to reciprocally engage with each other‚Äôs content can internalise this externality and might be socially desirable. However, it can also result in low-value engagement, especially when advertisers pay based on quantity rather than quality.</p>

<p>The key dimension to differentiating ‚Äòbad‚Äô from ‚Äònot-so-bad‚Äô cartels is the quality of cartel engagement. By ‚Äòhigh quality‚Äô, we mean engagement coming from influencers with similar interests. The idea is that influencers provide value to advertisers by promoting a product among the target audience: people with similar interests, such as vegan burgers to vegans. If a cartel generates engagement from influencers with other interests (meat lovers), this hurts consumers and advertisers. It hurts consumers because the platform will show them irrelevant content, and advertisers are hurt because their ads are shown to the wrong audience. Whether or not a particular cartel is welfare-reducing or welfare-improving is an empirical question.</p>

<h2>Evaluating engagement quality using machine-learning methods</h2>

<p>To answer this empirical question, we use novel data from influencer cartels and machine learning to analyse Instagram text and photos. The cartel data allows us to directly observe which Instagram posts are included in the cartel and which engagement originates from the cartel (via cartel rules). Our dataset includes two types of cartels, differentiated by cartel entry rules: topic cartels (which only accept influencers posting on specific topics) and general cartels (with unrestricted topics).</p>

<p>Our goal is to compare the quality of natural engagement to that originating from the cartel. We measure the quality by the topic match between the cartel member and the Instagram user who engages. To quantify the similarity of Instagram users, we generate numeric vectors (embeddings) from the text and photos in Instagram posts using a large language model (Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding) and an analogous large neural network (Contrastive Language Image Pre-training model). Then we calculate cosine similarity between the Instagram users based on these numeric vectors.</p>

<h2>Are the cartels likely to be welfare-improving?</h2>

<p>We find that engagement from general cartels is significantly lower in quality compared to natural engagement. Specifically, the quality of engagement from these cartels is nearly as low as that from a counterfactual engagement from a random Instagram user. In contrast, engagement from topic cartels is much closer to the quality of natural engagement.</p>

<p>The figure below illustrates these effects using raw data (see the paper for regression estimates, robustness checks, and additional analysis). It presents distributions of cosine similarity between the author and commenter, separately for general (left panel) and topic (right panel) cartels. It shows that non-cartel commenters (natural engagement) have the highest similarity with the author of the content, and random users have the lowest. Match quality from general cartels is similar to random engagement (left panel). In contrast, topic cartel engagement is much closer to natural engagement (right panel).</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2</strong> Probability density of authors‚Äô similarity to commenters and random users in general cartels (left) and topic cartels (right)</p>

  


<p>Back-of-the-envelope calculations (based on regression analysis) show that if advertisers pay for cartel engagement as if it were natural engagement, they receive only 3‚Äì18% of the value with general cartels, and 60‚Äì85% with topic cartels. In other words, general cartels provide nearly worthless engagement for advertisers, while topic cartels cause less distortion.</p>

<h2>Conclusions and policy implications</h2>

<p>Our findings lead to three policy implications. First, since general cartels are likely to reduce welfare, stronger regulation of their activities would benefit society. Second, regulations that prohibit buying and selling fake social media indicators should also cover in-kind transfers, such as paying for engagement with reciprocal engagement. Third, the current practice of rewarding engagement quantity encourages harmful collusion. A better approach would be to compensate influencers based on the actual value they provide. Luckily, many advertisers are already moving in this direction. Until they get there, platforms could improve outcomes by reporting match-quality-weighted engagement.</p>
