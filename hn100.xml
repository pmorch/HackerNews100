<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What if you could take every law, regulation and case in Australia and project them onto a two-dimensional map such that their distance from one another was proportional to their similarity in meaning? What would that look like?</p><p>Perhaps something like this.</p><div id="oalm-mobile"><figure> <img decoding="async" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/oalm/map.oalm.svg" alt="The first ever map of Australian law." data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure><p> <em>Note: since you’re on a mobile device, the map has been replaced with a screenshot. Hop on a computer to experience the map in all its interactive glory.</em></p></div><p>This is the first ever map of Australian law. Each point represents a unique law, regulation or case in the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/umarbutler/open-australian-legal-corpus">Open Australian Legal Corpus</a>, the world’s largest open source database of Australian law (you can learn about how I built that corpus <a href="https://umarbutler.com/how-i-built-the-largest-open-database-of-australian-law/">here</a>).</p><p>The closer any two documents are on the map, the more similar they are in meaning.</p><p>If you’re on a computer and hover over a document, you’ll see its title, type, jurisdiction and category. You can open a document by clicking on it.</p><p>Documents are coloured by category. The legend on the right shows what colour each category correspond to. Click on a category and you’ll exclude it from the map. Double click and you’ll only see documents from that category.</p><p>Over the course of this article, I’ll cover exactly what the map can teach us about Australian law as well as give you a behind-the-scenes look at how I built it, providing code examples along the way. Those more interested in the technology powering the map can skip straight to that section <a href="#so-howd-you-do-it" data-type="internal" data-id="#so-howd-you-do-it">here</a>.</p><h2>What can we learn from it?</h2><p>While it might not look like much at first, the map gives us a rare look into some of the many hidden ways Australian laws, regulations and cases are both connected to and disconnected from one another.</p><h3><em>The invisible barrier between cases and legislation</em></h3><p>It is readily observable, for example, that there is a sort of invisible barrier separating cases on the one hand from legislation on the other. This barrier corresponds roughly with the map’s north and south poles.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/types.map_.oalm_-2.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><em>An annotated version of the map where cases and legislation are enclosed in two shapes corresponding with the map’s north and south poles, respectively.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The presence of this barrier tells us that documents of the same type will tend to share more in common with each other than they will with documents of the same subject matter.</p><p>Although they may often focus on the same topics, cases and legislation are, after all, written in different styles, towards different ends.</p><h3>The absence of borders between documents of different jurisdictions</h3><p>Interestingly, however, we find no such borders between documents of different jurisdictions; although, it is worth noting, due to copyright restrictions, the Open Australian Legal Corpus only contains decisions from the Commonwealth and New South Wales and is missing legislation from Victoria, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/jurisdictions.annotated.map_.oalm_.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><em>An alternate view of the map where documents are coloured by jurisdiction, illustrating the lack of boundaries between documents of different jurisdictions.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The absence of borders between cases and legislation of different jurisdictions indicates that Australian state and federal law is relatively homogenous. There are no differences between the style, principles of interpretation or general jurisprudence of state and federal law that appear to be reflected in the map. Of what borders do exist between state and federal law, they correspond better with differences in subject matter than they do with the jurisprudence of their jurisdictions.</p><p>This conforms with fact that state and federal courts and legislatures operate within a single legal framework, under which they have jurisdiction over matters prescribed by the Constitution in their territory, with a single court, the High Court of Australia, arbitrating on disputes between governments over the precise limits of those constitutional rights and powers.</p><h3>The judicial and legislative mainlands and islands</h3><p>Turning back to the barrier between cases and legislation, we also observe that, within the map’s north and south poles, each pole has a ‘mainland’ of sorts that most documents belong to, and then there are a range of ‘islands’ that orbit those mainlands, typically consisting of documents of the same subject matter.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/islands.map_.oalm_.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><em>An annotated version of the map where ‘islands’ of documents of the same subject matter are enclosed in shapes that orbit ‘mainlands’ of cases and legislation.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The fact that there are judicial and legislative mainlands suggests that most cases and legislation draw from and feed into a single, interconnected pool of knowledge.</p><p>This is not particularly surprising. What is surprising is that there are large islands of legislation and judgments that are entirely cut off from their respective mainlands.</p><p><a href="https://www.abf.gov.au/importing-exporting-and-manufacturing/tariff-concessions-system/tariff-concession-order">Tariff concession orders</a>, for example, form their very own unique archipelago, perhaps because each order is centred around regulating a distinct, often quite technical class of importable goods, from <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2007L04317/latest/text">magazine holders</a> to <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2007L00538/latest/text">forklifts</a>.</p><p>There is also quite a sizeable island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airworthiness_Directive">airworthiness directives</a> primarily focused on regulating aircraft components, another highly technical domain.</p><p>Somewhat unexpectedly, the largest island by surface area consists almost entirely of migration cases. Furthermore, of all 19 possible branches of law, migration and family law are the only two to be found more often outside a mainland than inside one.</p><p>Migration and family law are, in effect, the most isolated areas of Australian law on the map.</p><p>Funnily enough, while researching why that might be, I stumbled upon this rather pertinent quote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Sumption,_Lord_Sumption">Lord Sumption</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Courts exercising family jurisdiction do not occupy a <em>desert island</em> in which general legal concepts are suspended or mean something different. If a right of property exists, it exists in every division of the High Court and in every jurisdiction of the county courts. If it does not exist, it does not exist anywhere.</p><p><a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2013-0004.html"><em>Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd</em></a> [2013] UKSC 34, [37] (emphasis added)</p></blockquote><p>I also discovered that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Munby">Munby LJ</a>, later President of the UK Family Division, had likewise once quipped:</p><blockquote><p>The Family Division is part of the High Court. It is not some legal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitefriars,_London#Alsatia">Alsatia</a> where the common law and equity do not apply. The rules of agency apply there as much as elsewhere. But in applying those rules one must have regard to the context …</p><p><em><a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/79.html">Richardson v Richardson</a></em> [2011] EWCA Civ 79, [53]</p></blockquote><p>It would seem that there was already a <a href="https://www.iclr.co.uk/blog/commentary/family-law-no-island-entire-unto-itself/">perception</a> that family law is somewhat isolated from the rest of the law, which the map appears to support.</p><p>As for migration law, although I was unable to locate equally apropos quotes, from my own review of a selection of cases on the map, they appear relatively self-contained in that they tend to reference legislation and cases particular to migration law. It also makes sense that migration law would be a little distant from other areas of law given its unique subject matter.</p><p>While not as insular as family and migration law, it is also worth addressing the relatively large hexagram-shaped island of criminal law, which features a tail of transport and administrative law cases coming out of it.</p><p>That island appears to consist mostly of substantive criminal law cases (along with certain punitive transport and administrative law cases focused on the suspension of various types of licences), whereas the criminal law cases connected to the judicial mainland tend to concern criminal procedure.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/criminal.annotated.map_.oalm_.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><em>An annotated version of criminal law cases with the island of substantive criminal law cases and the cluster of procedural criminal law cases connected to the judicial mainland enclosed in their own shapes. Only light blue data points are criminal cases.</em></figcaption></figure><p>This supports the broad division of substantive law into criminal law and civil law while also conforming well with the fact that criminal procedure law and civil procedure law share a number of common principles of natural justice.</p><h3>The most and least legislative areas of judicial law</h3><p>Fascinatingly, migration, family and substantive criminal law also all tend to cluster closely together latitudinally, hinting at potential hidden connection. They are all known to overlap in certain ways and they all share a special focus on regulating the lives of individuals, and not merely the property rights of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person">legal persons</a>.</p><p>Migration, family and substantive criminal law cases also all happen to be the most distant types of cases from legislation on the map. Of course, this does not mean that they never cite legislation, but it may be that they rely on precedent more often than other areas of case law. It might also be the result of the inherent difficulty in attempting to represent highly complex and multidimensional relationships in a simple two-dimensional map.</p><p>Conversely, the class of cases closest to legislation is development cases, which makes sense since they can often deal quite intimately with local planning laws and regulations.</p><h3>The case law continuum</h3><p>If we start at the bottom of the cases mainland and make our way up, we can also see that Australian case law is a continuum of sorts.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/judicial-mainland.annotated-1.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><em>An annotated version of the case law mainland where select branches of law are pointed out, illustrating the continuum of case law.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Development cases connect with environmental cases, which then link with land cases.</p><p>Land cases border contract cases which in turn have procedural cases to their north, intellectual property cases to their west and commercial cases to their east.</p><p>Moving further north of procedural law brings you to criminal law and defamation.</p><p>Heading west from intellectual property law takes you through administrative law, health and social services law, employment law, negligence and finally transport law.</p><p>Going east of commercial law, you’ll find equity and a subset of family law.</p><figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="2236" height="1258" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/compressed_animation.webp" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/compressed_animation.webp"><figcaption><em>An animation of branches of law appearing on the map sequentially, illustrating the continuum of case law.</em></figcaption></figure><p>This continuum corresponds well with our pre-existing understandings of the relationships between the various branches of the law.</p><p>It makes sense, for example, that development, environment and land law would all be intertwined given their similar subject matter. Likewise, it is not at all unexpected that negligence would cluster closely with transport and employment law when a great many negligence cases centre around motor and workplace accident claims.</p><p>The map, in effect, crystallises our own mental models of the law.</p><p>It also shows us that the borders between various areas of the law can often be quite porous. We notice, for instance, that there is a streak of land law judgments that overlaps with commercial and procedural law cases and is disconnected from most other land law cases. Interestingly, cases in this streak tend to focus on mortgage disputes often involving defaults which would explain why they overlap with commercial and procedural law cases.</p><p>We can also see that there are some transport law judgments that are connected to the cases mainland and then there are others that are connected to the island of substantive criminal law cases. Transport judgments connected to that island often centre around the suspension of transport licences, whereas judgments connected to the cases mainland tend to focus on transport accidents. Although disconnected from one another, however, both clusters of transport cases are still relatively close to each other, reflecting their shared subject matter.</p><h3>Final thoughts</h3><p>By now, we’ve covered how the map reflects already known distinctions between cases and legislation, while also revealing potential new divisions and hidden connections between various areas of the law. We’ve also seen how Australian case law can be more of a continuum than a rigidly defined structure and how the borders between branches of case law can often be quite porous.</p><p>Other specific insights we’ve been able to find are that:</p><ul><li>Migration, family and substantive criminal law are the most isolated branches of case law on the map;</li><li>Migration, family and substantive criminal law are the most distant branches of case law from legislation on the map;</li><li>Development law is the closest branch of case law to legislation on the map; and</li><li>The map does not reveal any noticeable distinctions between Australian state and federal law, whether it be in style, principles of interpretation or general jurisprudence.</li></ul><p>These are but a selection of the most readily observable insights to be gained from attempting to map Australian law. There are no doubt countless others waiting to be uncovered. Producing a three-dimensional map of Australian laws, cases and regulations could, for example, reveal new hidden relationships that are almost impossible to represent in two dimensions. Adding cases and legislation from other states and territories might also give us a sharper, higher resolution image of the map, deepening our understanding of the geography of Australian law. One could even imagine adding legal documents from other common law countries such as the UK, Canada and New Zealand to, in a sense, photograph the historic and continued interactions between our legal systems.</p><p>Nevertheless, for a first attempt, the map already has a lot to teach us. Perhaps you’ve even identified patterns in the map that I could not.</p><p>The greatest thing about this exercise is that it can be applied to virtually any domain, not just Australian law. Semantic mapping is particularly useful for very quickly developing an understanding of the underlying composition and structure of a dataset without having to manually scour through hundreds of examples to build your own much noisier and less persistent mental model of that data.</p><p>Since finishing the map, I’ve already been able to reuse this technique to study countless other seemingly unstructured large datasets, and you can too. It doesn’t take an expert in clustering and mapping to pull it off. Far from it. Prior to starting this project, I didn’t know the first thing about semantic mapping and now I’m about to teach you how to do it yourself.</p><h2 id="so-howd-you-do-it">So how’d you do it?</h2><p>At a high level, the process for mapping any arbitrary set of data points, whether they be PDFs, YouTube videos, TikToks or anything else, can be broken down into six stages, illustrated below.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/process.oalm_.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><em>An illustration of the process of semantically mapping data.</em></figcaption></figure><p>In brief, we try to represent the meaning of data in the form of sets of numbers (<em>vectorisation</em>), after which we group those sets into clusters based on their similarity (<em>clustering</em>) and subsequently label those clusters based on whatever unique patterns we can find in them (<em>labelling</em>). Finally, we project the numerical representations of the data into two-dimensional coordinates (<em>dimensionality reduction</em>) which we then plot on a map (<em>visualisation</em>).</p><p>Through this next section, we’ll take a deeper look at exactly how every step of the semantic mapping process works in practice. Before that though, I’d like to express my gratitude to the creators of <a href="https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BERTopic</a>, a topic modelling technique which this process was loosely based on, as well as <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mikedelong">Dr Mike DeLong</a> whose <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/mikedelong/australian-law-topics">topic map</a> of the Open Australian Legal Corpus served as the inspiration for this entire project.</p><h3>Vectorisation</h3><p>The first step in semantically mapping a dataset is to vectorise its data points.</p><p>In this context, <em>vectorisation</em> refers to the process of converting information into a set of numbers intended to represent its underlying meaning, known as a <em>vector</em> or <em>embedding</em>. By calculating how similar vectors are to one another, we can also get a rough idea of how similar they are in meaning. This principle is what allows us to later group data points into clusters and project them onto a two-dimensional map.</p><p>To vectorise a data point, we can use an <em>embedding model</em>, a model specially trained for the task of representing the meaning of information as vectors. Thankfully, for my uses and probably yours too, it isn’t necessary to train a custom embedding model or pay someone to use theirs. At least for text vectorisation, most of the world’s best models are already available for free and under open-source licences.</p><p>Hugging Face helpfully maintains a ranked list of the most accurate text embedding models as benchmarked against hundreds of datasets, known as the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard">Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Leaderboard</a>. When I built the map, <code><a href="https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5">BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5</a></code> was one of the best open-source models available for its size, so that’s what I went with. Nowadays, <code><a href="https://huggingface.co/avsolatorio/GIST-small-Embedding-v0">avsolatorio/GIST-small-Embedding-v0</a></code> (a finetune of that model) ranks higher, but its worth checking out the leaderboard yourself as new models are released every day.</p><p>One constraint of contemporary text embedding models worth keeping in mind is that they can only vectorise a fixed number of <em>tokens</em>, known as a <em>context window</em>. If you don’t know what a token is, you can think of it as the most basic unit of input a text model can take. There are roughly 0.75 tokens in a word. So, if a text embedding model’s context window is 512 tokens like <code>GIST-small-Embedding-v0</code>‘s is, then you can only vectorise roughly 384 words at a time.</p><p>To get around this, we can split text into chunks up to 512 tokens long, vectorise each chunk and then average those vectors to produce a mean text embedding that represents the average meaning of the text. This process can also be applied to vectorise videos and audio clips longer than what an embedding model can take as input or really any other type of embeddable data.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/OALM-Vectorisation-1.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><em>An illustration of the process of producing a mean embedding.</em></figcaption></figure><p>In splitting up our long-form data, however, it is essential that we do so in as meaningful a way as possible. Simply breaking up text at every 512th-token or, if we’re working with audiovisual data, 512th-second, could result in the loss of semantically important information. Imagine if we ended up splitting the sentence ‘I love to eat kangaroo gummies, they’re my favourite snack’ at the word ‘kangaroo’, resulting in the chunks ‘I love to eat kangaroo’ and ‘gummies, they’re my favourite snack’. The final embedding would no doubt be quite dissimilar from the text’s actual meaning.</p><p>Ideally, we’d like for our data to have already been divided into semantically meaningful sections that are all under our model’s context window. Realistically though, our data may not have any sections at all or, if it does have sections, not all may fit within the model’s context window. In such cases, we can first split our data into whatever parts we do have and then use a <em>semantic chunker</em> to bring whatever data is over the context window, under it.</p><p>For text data, I’d recommend <code><a href="https://github.com/umarbutler/semchunk">semchunk</a></code>, an extremely fast and lightweight Python library I developed to split millions of tokens worth of text into chunks as semantically meaningful as possible in a matter of seconds. It works by searching for sequences of characters known to indicate semantic breaks in text such as consecutive newlines and tabs, and then recursively splitting at those sequences until a text is under the given chunk size.</p><p>The code snippet below demonstrates exactly how you can use <code>semchunk</code> to split a dataset of documents into chunks with any given Hugging Face text embedding model of your choice. Just make sure you have <code><a href="https://github.com/umarbutler/semchunk">semchunk</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transformers</a></code> installed beforehand.</p> <p>After chunking our data, we still need to vectorise it and then average those vectors such that<code> [1,</code> <code>2]</code> and <code>[3, 4]</code> becomes <code>[2, 3]</code> (not <code>[7]</code>). This is how’d you do that in practice, keeping in mind this code also requires <code><a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">torch</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tqdm</a></code>:</p> <h3>Dimensionality reduction</h3><p>Now that we’ve vectorised our data, the next step is to reduce its dimensionality. Dimensionality reduction is where you take a really long vector like <code>[4, 2, 1, 5, ..]</code> and turn it into lower-dimension coordinates like <code>[4, 2]</code>. This is how we map our data. It also makes our data easier to cluster later on, since high-dimensional data can often be quite tricky to cluster due to the ‘<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0019-x">curse of dimensionality</a>‘.</p><p>To reduce the data’s dimensionality, we use a <em>dimensionality reduction model</em>, a model capable of projecting high-dimensional data into low-dimensional spaces while preserving as much meaningful information as possible.</p><p>The model I used was <a href="https://github.com/YingfanWang/PaCMAP">PaCMAP</a>, which benchmarks as one of the fastest and most accurate dimensionality reduction models, capable of preserving both global and local structures in underlying datasets. The visualisation below, courtesy of their GitHub repository, shows what it looks like when you attempt to reduce a three-dimensional model of a mammoth down to two dimensions with PaCMAP (visible on the far right) and other popular dimensionality reduction models.</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="936" height="720" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PaCMAP-Mammoth.png" alt="" srcset="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PaCMAP-Mammoth.png 936w, https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PaCMAP-Mammoth-300x231.png 300w, https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PaCMAP-Mammoth-768x591.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PaCMAP-Mammoth.png"><figcaption><em>A visualisation of the reduction of a three-dimensional model of a mammoth down to two dimensions with the most popular dimensionality reduction models, courtesy of the Apache-2.0 licensed <a href="https://github.com/YingfanWang/PaCMAP">PaCMAP</a> GitHub repository.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Now, because we’re using PaCMAP for two different purposes, namely, to map the data and to make it easier to cluster, we can reduce our vectors to two different dimensions.</p><p>For mapping, two dimensions is what I went with but it’s also possible to visualise three.</p><p>For clustering, I choose 80 because my clusters seemed to benefit from high-dimensional data and 80 was the most dimensions I could use without slowing my PC down too much. What worked for me, however, may not work for you. With another dataset of ~400 data points, much lower than the Open Australian Legal Corpus’ 200k documents, I had found that 2 dimensions worked considerably better than 80. It is worth testing a range of dimensions to see what yields the best clusters for your data.</p><p>After installing the <code><a href="https://github.com/YingfanWang/PaCMAP">pacmap</a></code> Python package, you can use the following code to reduce the dimensionality of your data for both mapping and later clustering it:</p> <h3>Clustering</h3><p>Once the dimensionality of your data has been reduced, we can use a <em>clustering model</em> to group it into clusters of data points that are close together in our vector space. These clusters tend to correlate with the broad set of topics and themes present in a dataset.</p><p>There are a range of clustering models to choose from, each with their own unique advantages and drawbacks. I ended up settling on <a href="https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan">HDBSCAN</a>, which is generally <a href="https://pberba.github.io/stats/2020/07/08/intro-hdbscan/">well-regarded</a>. They have a <a href="https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/comparing_clustering_algorithms.html">page</a> in their documentation which covers their differences with other popular clustering methods. The most notable differentiator is that, unlike older algorithms such as <em>k</em>-means, HDBSCAN does not force every data point into a cluster, which is quite reasonable. There will always be data points that don’t quite fit into a known box. Forcing them into boxes just makes those boxes noisier.</p><p>The only problem with HDBSCAN is that it can sometimes be overzealous in refusing to cluster data points. In my case, there were 218,336 legal texts in the Open Australian Legal Corpus at the time that I produced the map and 84,780 (38.8%) could not be clustered. A further 10,100 (4.6%) were placed in clusters that did not appear to have any meaningful unifying features. In total, there were 94,880 (43.4%) documents that could not be assigned to a meaningful cluster and so were excluded from the map.</p><p>This is what the map would have looked like if I had included them.</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="2240" height="1260" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/unassigned.map_.oalm_.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><em>A version of the map with documents without meaningful clusters included.</em></figcaption></figure><p>It is clear that there were documents that HDBSCAN could and should have clustered, such as those part of the criminal and family law islands. This is likely the result of the curse of dimensionality but it may also be because I used <code><a href="https://github.com/TutteInstitute/fast_hdbscan">fast_hdbscan</a></code>, a faster implementation of HDBSCAN that I later discovered has a tendency to produce patchier clusters than regular HDBSCAN.</p><p>Accordingly, I’ll be using regular HDBSCAN in my code example.</p><p>You will notice that there are two hyperparameters that may be tuned, <code>min_cluster_size</code> and <code>min_samples</code>. Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/5sfj0y/comment/ddfabms/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this</a> Reddit comment and my own experimentation, I have found that <code>min_samples</code> should approach <code>log(n)</code> the noisier your dataset is, where <code>n</code> is the number of data points in the dataset. For clean data, it is appropriate to set <code>min_samples</code> to 1, which is what I used.</p><p><code>min_cluster_size</code> refers to the minimum number of data points that should be in a cluster. It is possible to yield meaningful clusters with both low and high minimum cluster sizes. It may be thought of as a control on how generalised clusters should be. For granular clusters reflecting specific topics in your data, a low minimum cluster size is preferable. For a couple broad clusters reflecting general themes in your data, a higher minimum cluster size is advised.</p><p>I ended up going with a cluster size of 50, which, in proportion to the size of my database, was minuscule. I only did this because I wanted to manually merge clusters myself in order to ensure that the final clusters were both as broad as I wanted them to be and were as precise as they could be. This resulted in 507 unique clusters (excluding the unassigned cluster), which I manually whittled down to 19 branches of law. I’ll get into how I pulled that off in the next section but for now, here is the code for how HDBSCAN can be used to cluster vectors:</p> <h3>Labelling</h3><p>After clustering your data, you’ll want to assign some meaningful labels to those clusters. This means figuring out exactly what it is that they share in common.</p><p>There are a number of techniques to choose from for identifying meaningful labels for clusters, including the use of tf-idf, generative AI-based labellers and of course hand labelling. I won’t get into all the options available, I’ll just cover what worked for me.</p><p>First, I identified the top tokens in each cluster by their tf-idf, which is a measure of a token’s frequency in a cluster weighted by its overall frequency in a dataset, such that tokens that are extremely common in only one cluster will have a higher tf-idf for that cluster than tokens that are extremely common in all clusters. This served as an easy way to quickly associate clusters with labels reflecting their unique composition.</p><p>With the top tokens by tf-idf in hand, I merged any clusters whose top four tokens were the same, which got rid of just 2 of the 507 clusters. Next, I manually reviewed the clusters in order to produce a set of 337 rules on how to merge them based on their top tokens.</p><p>In manually merging clusters, I tried my best to be as agnostic as possible on what the final set of categories should look like. The idea was to let the data guide me, rather than me guiding the data. As the number of clusters began to dwindle, however, I soon found myself forced to make increasingly difficult decisions about what categories to include and exclude, such as whether it would better to roll up health and social services law into a single area of law rather than creating a commercial law category out of tax, finance and insolvency law. I originally wanted to include many more areas of law than the 19 branches you see on the map now, but I was ultimately constrained by the fact that even visualising 19 easily distinguishable categories on a map with contiguous continents is no small feat (it was only thanks to a colour <a href="https://sashamaps.net/docs/resources/20-colors/">palette</a> published by fellow data scientist Sasha Trubetskoy that I managed to pull it off!).</p><p>Eventually, I ended up settling on a set of clusters that I felt were a reasonable way of dividing up my map, although I recognise it may not necessarily be the most optimal way, if such an optimum even exists.</p><p>This merging process was one of the most difficult components of building the map, second only to writing this article, but it also taught me a lot not only about the broad makeup of Australian law but also about the many different ways law in general can be sliced up.</p><p>I would only recommend manually merging clusters if you also want to develop an intimate understanding of the composition of your data or if it is particularly important to you that the final product be as precise and accurate as possible. Otherwise, it would be much more beneficial to tune your clustering model to produce a more manageable amount of clusters. You can then automatically label those clusters by either taking their top three tokens by tf-idf as their label or using a large language model to generate more coherent labels from those tokens.</p><p>In the code snippet below, I show how you can identify the top tokens in a cluster by tf-idf. Please note that the code relies on <code><a href="https://www.nltk.org/">nltk</a></code>.</p> <p>If you wanted to take your automated labelling a step further, you could also use the following code to get GPT-4 (or another OpenAI API-compatible model) to generate labels for you, keeping in mind that this code requires the <code><a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-python">openai</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/umarbutler/semchunk">semchunk</a></code> Python libraries.</p> <h3>Visualisation</h3><p>At this point, the only piece of the puzzle left is to visualise your map. There are a number of Python libraries capable of producing two- and three-dimensional scatter plots, but none of them are particularly impressive, including the library I eventually settled on, which was <a href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a>.</p><p>My main grievance with Plotly is that it does not let you expand the size of data points when zooming into a map. This really becomes an issue where you have hundreds of thousands of data points and you find that they either overlap with each other or, if you reduce their size, they become almost impossible to identify when zoomed in. There is a 3-year-old <a href="http://GitHub issue">GitHub issue</a> concerning this problem but it doesn’t look like it will get solved anytime soon.</p><p>There were other less severe issues I experienced with Plotly that I was able to work around with custom CSS and Javascript. I won’t provide that code at the moment as it is not particularly pretty, but I will share a code snippet illustrating how Plotly can be used to visualise mapped data:</p> <p>With that done, you should now have your very semantic map. The next step is to analyse it. Look for patterns in the map’s geography, inspect outliers, search for islands, get a sense of the underlying structure of your data.</p><p>As my own analysis has shown, there is a lot you can learn just by mapping a dataset. And, once you get the ball rolling, it can quickly spiral into an addition. I have hundreds of ideas for how to expand my map to uncover new relationships. The real power of semantic mapping comes out when you apply it against very large datasets. Imagine applying these techniques on the <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a> corpus, for example. You would be able to produce a first-of-its-kind high-resolution map of the internet.</p><p>If you do end up publishing your own semantic map, be sure to cite this article to enable others to learn about the power of semantic mapping.</p><p>Otherwise, happy mapping!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary"><span>Users of the</span> popular site Glassdoor, which lets anyone anonymously sign up to review companies they have worked for, say Glassdoor collected and added their names to their user profiles without their consent.</p>
<p>One user, who goes by Monica, wrote in a post on her personal blog that Glassdoor added her name and the city where she lives to her Glassdoor profile following an email exchange with Glassdoor customer support, despite having never provided her name during the sign-up process some years earlier. Monica, whose last name we’re not publishing to protect her privacy, accused Glassdoor of getting her full name from the email she sent to customer support, which she says they added to her Glassdoor profile.</p>
<p>“My email ‘from’ line contains my full name — never thought that would be a problem!” Monica told TechCrunch in an email. “They then added my name to my Glassdoor profile.”</p>
<p>Monica repeatedly protested Glassdoor, telling customer support that the company did not have her consent or permission to do this. But Glassdoor said Monica was “required” to have her name added to her profile, adding that this would not compromise her anonymity of past reviews she gave. Monica said that her anonymity might not last if Glassdoor was to experience a hack or a data breach and compromise users’ data. It also means this information can be obtained by legal process, such as a lawsuit or police demanding access to Glassdoor user data.</p>
<p>As Monica explained, Glassdoor will add a user’s real name (and potentially other information) to the user’s account without their permission if Glassdoor learns it.</p>
<p>And the only other option is to delete your account, Monica said.</p>
<p>Glassdoor users expressed alarm at Monica’s story, which has been widely shared on social media and news-sharing sites, for fear that their anonymity could be compromised by having data collected about them and added to their profiles, as well.</p>

<p>Glassdoor has long allowed users to sign up anonymously. In 2021, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/glassdoor-fishbowl-linkedin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glassdoor bought Fishbowl</a>, a semi-anonymous professional social network site that allows users to “ask questions without disclosing your name.” Ars Technica, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/glassdoor-adding-users-real-names-job-info-to-profiles-without-consent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported</a> Monica’s story, explained that Fishbowl requires users to verify their identities before using the site. As part of the acquisition deal, Glassdoor signed every user up for a Fishbowl account, meaning Glassdoor would have to change its terms of service so that every Glassdoor user could also be verified.</p>
<p>Aaron Mackey, an attorney with the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, told TechCrunch that Glassdoor has been an “industry leader” in defending its users’ anonymity. Mackey previously defended an anonymous Glassdoor user in court whose employer <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-fights-protect-anonymity-glassdoor-commenter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to unmask and identify their identity</a>.</p>
<p>“We hope that Glassdoor will continue to defend its users’ anonymity in court,” said Mackey. “But the latest news regarding Glassdoor’s policies raises concerns about whether users may be identified even if their information is never sought by an employer or law enforcement. Those policies also appear to conflict with, or at least be in tension with, Glassdoor’s goal of encouraging employees to candidly review their employers.”</p>
<p>In some cases, the data added to the user’s profile did not completely line up.</p>
<p>Josh Simmons said Glassdoor added information about him to his profile without his consent, describing it as a “breach of trust.” Simmons told TechCrunch that he did not know how Glassdoor got his personal data.</p>
<p>“It’s not clear to me how they got this information,” Simmons told TechCrunch. “I didn’t have any social accounts connected to Glassdoor, and I hadn’t used the service in several years,” suggesting that the data may have been scraped or come from a data broker.</p>
<p>Simmons said his supplemented Glassdoor profile had an “incoherent mix of details, but each detail was correct in isolation,” describing how Glassdoor got the name of his consultancy correct but jumbled his location in California with his main client based in London.</p>
<p>“Taken together, it signaled to me that it was the result of an automated process,” Simmons said.</p>
<p>By Glassdoor’s own admission, the company <a href="https://help.glassdoor.com/s/article/Does-Glassdoor-verify-employees?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says on its website</a> that it is “unable to fully confirm our users’ identities, the truthfulness of their contributions, or their employment status.” It’s not clear what the goal of Glassdoor’s data collection is if the information is not accurate.</p>
<p>When reached for comment, Glassdoor spokesperson Amanda Livingood would not answer TechCrunch’s specific questions, including how — if at all — Glassdoor verifies the accuracy of the information it receives, or how it can be used or obtained. Glassdoor does not publish a transparency report detailing the number of requests for user data it receives from law enforcement.</p>
<p>Instead, the company provided a boilerplate statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Glassdoor is committed to providing a platform for people to share their opinions and experiences about their jobs and companies, anonymously – without fear of intimidation or retaliation. User reviews on Glassdoor have always and will always be anonymous. In the Glassdoor community, users always have the choice to post with their name or post anonymously with their company name or job title. Glassdoor has never and will never reveal a user’s name alongside their content, unless that is what the user chooses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mackey said that the risk of data breaches or legal demands are magnified because Glassdoor is now collecting more information about users that could identify them. “But because Glassdoor now collects that information, including from email addresses and headers, Glassdoor now has data that directly identifies their users,” Mackey said.</p>
<p>That leaves users like Monica with no choice but to delete their account if they are not willing to have their name on their profile. And so Monica did.</p>
<p><em>According to Monica, closing your account just deactivates it. If you want to fully delete your Glassdoor account, you can head over to <strong><a href="https://help.glassdoor.com/s/privacyrequest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this specific Glassdoor privacy request page</a></strong> and fill out the data request form with the appropriate selection, such as “Delete my personal data.”</em></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce Chronos, a simple yet effective framework for pretrained probabilistic time series models. Chronos tokenizes time series values using scaling and quantization into a fixed vocabulary and trains existing transformer-based language model architectures on these tokenized time series via the cross-entropy loss. We pretrained Chronos models based on the T5 family (ranging from 20M to 710M parameters) on a large collection of publicly available datasets, complemented by a synthetic dataset that we generated via Gaussian processes to improve generalization. In a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 42 datasets, and comprising both classical local models and deep learning methods, we show that Chronos models: (a) significantly outperform other methods on datasets that were part of the training corpus; and (b) have comparable and occasionally superior zero-shot performance on new datasets, relative to methods that were trained specifically on them. Our results demonstrate that Chronos models can leverage time series data from diverse domains to improve zero-shot accuracy on unseen forecasting tasks, positioning pretrained models as a viable tool to greatly simplify forecasting pipelines.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Your grade school teacher probably didn’t show you how to add 20-digit numbers. But if you know how to add smaller numbers, all you need is paper and pencil and a bit of patience. Start with the ones place and work leftward step by step, and soon you’ll be stacking up quintillions with ease.</p>
<p>Problems like this are easy for humans, but only if we approach them in the right way. “How we humans solve these problems is not ‘stare at it and then write down the answer,’” said <a href="https://www.eranmalach.com/">Eran Malach</a>, a machine learning researcher at Harvard University. “We actually walk through the steps.”</p>
<p>That insight has inspired researchers studying the large language models that power chatbots like ChatGPT. While these systems might ace questions involving a few steps of arithmetic, they’ll often flub problems involving many steps, like calculating the sum of two large numbers. But in 2022, a team of Google researchers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903">showed</a> that asking language models to generate step-by-step solutions enabled the models to solve problems that had previously seemed beyond their reach. Their technique, called chain-of-thought prompting, soon became widespread, even as researchers struggled to understand what makes it work.</p>
<p>Now, several teams have explored the power of chain-of-thought reasoning by using techniques from an arcane branch of theoretical computer science called computational complexity theory. It’s the latest chapter in a line of research that uses complexity theory to study the intrinsic capabilities and limitations of language models. These efforts clarify where we should expect models to fail, and they might point toward new approaches to building them.</p>
<p>“They remove some of the magic,” said <a href="https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/Faculty/Papailiopoulos_Dimitris/">Dimitris Papailiopoulos</a>, a machine learning researcher at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. “That’s a good thing.”</p>
<h2><strong>Training Transformers</strong></h2>
<p>Large language models are built around mathematical structures called artificial neural networks. The many “neurons” inside these networks perform simple mathematical operations on long strings of numbers representing individual words, transmuting each word that passes through the network into another. The details of this mathematical alchemy depend on another set of numbers called the network’s parameters, which quantify the strength of the connections between neurons.</p>

<p>To train a language model to produce coherent outputs, researchers typically start with a neural network whose parameters all have random values, and then feed it reams of data from around the internet. Each time the model sees a new block of text, it tries to predict each word in turn: It guesses the second word based on the first, the third based on the first two, and so on. It compares each prediction to the actual text, then tweaks its parameters to reduce the difference. Each tweak only changes the model’s predictions a tiny bit, but somehow their collective effect enables a model to respond coherently to inputs it has never seen.</p>
<p>Researchers have been training neural networks to process language for 20 years. But the work really took off in 2017, when researchers at Google introduced a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">new kind of network</a> called a transformer.</p>
<p>“This was proposed seven years ago, which seems like prehistory,” said <a href="https://pbarcelo.ing.uc.cl/">Pablo Barceló</a>, a machine learning researcher at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.</p>
<p>What made transformers so transformative is that it’s easy to scale them up — to increase the number of parameters and the amount of training data — without making training prohibitively expensive. Before transformers, neural networks had at most a few hundred million parameters; today, the largest transformer-based models have more than a trillion. Much of the improvement in language-model performance over the past five years comes from simply scaling up.</p>
<p>Transformers made this possible by using special mathematical structures called attention heads, which give them a sort of bird’s-eye view of the text they’re reading. When a transformer reads a new block of text, its attention heads quickly scan the whole thing and identify relevant connections between words — perhaps noting that the fourth and eighth words are likely to be most useful for predicting the 10th. Then the attention heads pass words along to an enormous web of neurons called a feedforward network, which does the heavy number crunching needed to generate the predictions that help it learn.</p>
<p>Real transformers have multiple layers of attention heads separated by feedforward networks, and only spit out predictions after the last layer. But at each layer, the attention heads have already identified the most relevant context for each word, so the computationally intensive feedforward step can happen simultaneously for every word in the text. That speeds up the training process, making it possible to train transformers on increasingly large sets of data. Even more important, it allows researchers to spread the enormous computational load of training a massive neural network across many processors working in tandem.</p>
<p>To get the most out of massive data sets, “you have to make the models really large,” said <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~dchiang/">David Chiang</a>, a machine learning researcher at the University of Notre Dame. “It’s just not going to be practical to train them unless it’s parallelized.”</p>

<p>However, the parallel structure that makes it so easy to train transformers doesn’t help after training — at that point, there’s no need to predict words that already exist. During ordinary operation, transformers output one word at a time, tacking each output back onto the input before generating the next word, but they’re still stuck with an architecture optimized for parallel processing.</p>
<p>As transformer-based models grew and certain tasks continued to give them trouble, some researchers began to wonder whether the push toward more parallelizable models had come at a cost. Was there a way to understand the behavior of transformers theoretically?</p>
<h2><strong>The Complexity of Transformers</strong></h2>
<p>Theoretical studies of neural networks face many difficulties, especially when they try to account for training. Neural networks use a well-known procedure to tweak their parameters at each step of the training process. But it can be difficult to understand why this simple procedure converges on a good set of parameters.</p>
<p>Rather than consider what happens during training, some researchers study the intrinsic capabilities of transformers by imagining that it’s possible to adjust their parameters to any arbitrary values. This amounts to treating a transformer as a special type of programmable computer.</p>
<p>“You’ve got some computing device, and you want to know, ‘Well, what can it do? What kinds of functions can it compute?’” Chiang said.</p>
<p>These are the central questions in the formal study of computation. The field dates back to 1936, when Alan Turing first imagined a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/alan-turings-most-important-machine-was-never-built-20230503/">fanciful device</a>, now called a Turing machine, that could perform any computation by reading and writing symbols on an infinite tape. Computational complexity theorists would later build on Turing’s work by proving that computational problems naturally fall into different <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-short-guide-to-hard-problems-20180716/">complexity classes</a> defined by the resources required to solve them.</p>
<p>In 2019, Barceló and two other researchers <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03429">proved</a> that an idealized version of a transformer with a fixed number of parameters could be just as powerful as a Turing machine. If you set up a transformer to repeatedly feed its output back in as an input and set the parameters to the appropriate values for the specific problem you want to solve, it will eventually spit out the correct answer.</p>
<p>That result was a starting point, but it relied on some unrealistic assumptions that would likely overestimate the power of transformers. In the years since, researchers have worked to develop more realistic theoretical frameworks.</p>
<p>One such effort began in 2021, when <a href="https://lambdaviking.com/">William Merrill</a>, now a graduate student at New York University, was leaving a two-year fellowship at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle. While there, he’d analyzed other kinds of neural networks using techniques that seemed like a poor fit for transformers’ parallel architecture. Shortly before leaving, he struck up a conversation with the Allen Institute for AI researcher <a href="https://allenai.org/team/ashishs">Ashish Sabharwal</a>, who’d studied complexity theory before moving into AI research. They began to suspect that complexity theory might help them understand the limits of transformers.</p>

<p>“It just seemed like it’s a simple model; there must be some limitations that one can just nail down,” Sabharwal said.</p>
<p>The pair analyzed transformers using a branch of computational complexity theory, called circuit complexity, that is often used to study parallel computation and had <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06618">recently been applied</a> to simplified versions of transformers. Over the following year, they refined several of the unrealistic assumptions in previous work. To study how the parallel structure of transformers might limit their capabilities, the pair considered the case where transformers didn’t feed their output back into their input — instead, their first output would have to be the final answer. They <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00729">proved</a> that the transformers in this theoretical framework couldn’t solve any computational problems that lie outside a specific complexity class. And many math problems, including relatively simple ones like solving linear equations, are thought to lie outside this class.</p>
<p>Basically, they showed that parallelism did come at a cost — at least when transformers had to spit out an answer right away. “Transformers are quite weak if the way you use them is you give an input, and you just expect an immediate answer,” Merrill said.</p>
<h2><strong>Thought Experiments</strong></h2>
<p>Merrill and Sabharwal’s results raised a natural question — how much more powerful do transformers become when they’re allowed to recycle their outputs? Barceló and his co-authors had studied this case in their 2019 analysis of idealized transformers, but with more realistic assumptions the question remained open. And in the intervening years, researchers had discovered chain-of-thought prompting, giving the question a newfound relevance.</p>
<p>Merrill and Sabharwal knew that their purely mathematical approach couldn’t capture all aspects of chain-of-thought reasoning in real language models, where the wording in the prompt <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10001">can be very important</a>. But no matter how a prompt is phrased, as long as it causes a language model to output step-by-step solutions, the model can in principle reuse the results of intermediate steps on subsequent passes through the transformer. That could provide a way to evade the limits of parallel computation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a team from Peking University had been thinking along similar lines, and their preliminary results were positive. In a May 2023 paper, they identified some math problems that should be impossible for ordinary transformers in Merrill and Sabharwal’s framework, and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15408">showed</a> that intermediate steps enabled the transformers to solve these problems.</p>
<p>In October, Merrill and Sabharwal followed up their earlier work with a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07923">detailed theoretical study</a> of the computational power of chain of thought. They quantified how that extra computational power depends on the number of intermediate steps a transformer is allowed to use before it must spit out a final answer. In general, researchers expect the appropriate number of intermediate steps for solving any problem to depend on the size of the input to the problem. For example, the simplest strategy for adding two 20-digit numbers requires twice as many intermediate addition steps as the same approach to adding two 10-digit numbers.</p>
<p>Examples like this suggest that transformers wouldn’t gain much from using just a few intermediate steps. Indeed, Merrill and Sabharwal proved that chain of thought only really begins to help when the number of intermediate steps grows in proportion to the size of the input, and many problems require the number of intermediate steps to grow much larger still.</p>
<p>The thoroughness of the result impressed researchers. “They really pinned this down,” said <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/">Daniel Hsu</a>, a machine learning researcher at Columbia University.</p>
<p>Merrill and Sabharwal’s recent work indicates that chain of thought isn’t a panacea — in principle, it can help transformers solve harder problems, but only at the cost of a lot of computational effort.</p>
<p>“We’re interested in different ways of getting around the limitations of transformers with one step,” Merrill said. “Chain of thought is one way, but this paper shows that it might not be the most economical way.”</p>
<h2><strong>Back to Reality </strong></h2>
<p>Still, researchers caution that this sort of theoretical analysis can only reveal so much about real language models. Positive results — proofs that transformers can in principle solve certain problems — don’t imply that a language model will actually learn those solutions during training.</p>

<p>And even results that address the limitations of transformers come with caveats: They indicate that no transformer can solve certain problems perfectly in all cases. Of course, that’s a pretty high bar. “There might be special cases of the problem that it could handle just fine,” Hsu said.</p>
<p>Despite these caveats, the new work offers a template for analyzing different kinds of neural network architectures that might eventually replace transformers. If a complexity theory analysis suggests that certain types of networks are more powerful than others, that would be evidence that those networks might fare better in the real world as well.</p>
<p>Chiang also stressed that research on the limitations of transformers is all the more valuable as language models are increasingly used in a wide range of real-world applications, making it easy to overestimate their abilities.</p>
<p>“There’s actually a lot of things that they don’t do that well, and we need to be very, very cognizant of what the limitations are,” Chiang said. “That’s why this kind of work is really important.”</p>

<p>Glassdoor users have been reporting lately that the platform has introduced changes in its privacy policy, which include publishing people’s real names and locations on their profiles without securing consent.</p>



<p>Glassdoor is a website where current and former employees can anonymously submit reviews about their experiences working for a company, including details such as their employer’s culture, management practices, salaries, work-life balance, and more. Job seekers can read those reviews to help them make job-related decisions, and employees can use anonymous feedback to improve on key areas.</p>



<p>While Glassdoor is built on the principle of transparency, it wouldn’t work without securing anonymity for reviewers, as exposing internal practices could put reviewers in legal trouble, blacklisting, firing, and other forms of retaliation. Yet, this is precisely what is happening to the platform right now, according to some user reports.</p>



<p>A Glassdoor account holder named ‘Monica’ posted about her recent experience explaining that she created an account about ten years ago when the platform only required an email address. She specifically chose not to link her Glassdoor account with Facebook or Google.</p>



<p>After responding to a support email from Glassdoor, Monica noticed that her profile had been updated to include her real name and location without the platform asking for her consent.</p>



<p>This discovery led to a series of email exchanges with Glassdoor’s support team, during which the author was informed of a new policy requiring all users to verify their identity for full platform access. The support agents explain that this was happening in the context of a transition to a “verified network,” including the introduction of ‘Fishbowl’ accounts linked to Glassdoor profiles.</p>



<p>Fishbowl is a semi-anonymous social networking platform designed for professionals to connect, share insights, and engage in discussions. The platform was bought by Glassdoor in 2021, and its engineers are working on introducing some level of integration that would offer users a combination of Glassdoor’s insights and Fishbowl’s networking opportunities.</p>



<p>Monica strongly objected to the whole idea, citing privacy concerns and the potential risks of such information being exposed, especially in relation to their employment and the security of their data online. Glassdoor’s support agents didn’t yield and insisted that real names cannot be removed, so the only option for Monica would be to delete the account entirely.</p>



<p>Monica concludes by advising all Glassdoor users to delete their accounts. According to the <a href="https://help.glassdoor.com/s/privacyrequest?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platform’s privacy policy</a>, deletion merely deactivates the account, and to completely erase personal data, one must specifically request the deletion of their personal data through a form provided at the bottom of Glassdoor’s data policy page.</p>



<p>A report that appeared in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/glassdoor-added-real-names-profiles-without-consent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TechCrunch</a> yesterday attempts to fill in some of the gaps left in <a href="https://cellio.dreamwidth.org/2024/03/12/glassdoor-violates-privacy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monica’s blog post</a>, such as how exactly Glassdoor got to know the user’s name without them giving it. Another Glassdoor user, Josh Simmons, who also got his name exposed on his public profile without previously sharing it with the platform, speculates that the info was either scraped or acquired from a data broker, both very shady scenarios. </p>





<p>Aaron Mackey from the Electronic Frontier Foundation highlighted Glassdoor’s previous unwavering stance in protecting its users’ anonymity in courts and called the recent developments highly concerning.</p>



<p>RestorePrivacy has contacted Glassdoor for a comment on the allegations and clarifications on its policies on user anonymity, and we will update this post as soon as we hear back.</p>



<p>In the meantime, if you have a Glassdoor account and have posted anything in the past, make sure to log in and check the information included on your public profile to avoid damaging exposure.</p>

<p>Here is an introduction and survey of Algorithmic Mathematical Art.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, they were merely visualization aids in the study of mathematics. Gradually, the complexity and artistry of the images becomes an end itself.</p>

<p>Here, i examine the various methods of algorithmic mathematical art, and indicate the states of the art and possibilities. At the end, i give a definition of Algorithmic Mathematical Art.</p>

<h2>Geometric Surfaces</h2>

<p>Plots of arbitrary 3D surfaces for visual arts purposes has not been explored much. The exception is visualization of some special mathematical surfaces, especially in differential geometry. (for example:
minimal surfaces at <a href="http://virtualmathmuseum.org/Surface/gallery_m.html" data-accessed="2017-11-24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://virtualmathmuseum.org/Surface/gallery_m.html</a>
.)</p>

<p>As of today, it is scarcely known how surfaces look like of arbitrary equations of 3 variables. Equations with more than 3 variables can be projected or sliced to 3 dimensional space, and this is completely unexplored.</p>

<h2>Regular Solids of 3 or more dimensions</h2>

<p>In 2 dimensions we have regular polygons, such as square and pentagon and hexagon. The 3-dimensional version is called regular polyhedron. For example: cube, octahedron, icosahedron. The general name for such objects in any dimension is called polytope.</p>

<p>Polyhedrons
as artistic themes have been explored greatly, way back in the Greek times and in different cultures, often exhibited as toys, sculptures, paper models (origami), or hanging decoration. In modern times, polyhedrons have been exhibited as architecture element as well. (Examples: the

<p>Computer models as visual arts have been very popular. However, most of them are direct rendering of the mathematical object with almost no artistic value. Commonly seen are polyhedrons rendered with latest ray-tracing computer graphics advances, with some stellation or truncation. Highly artist algorithmic exploration of polytopes is almost non-existent. The image by Michael Trott above, of a dodecahedron rendered as linked pentagonal rings, is a basic artistic exploration.</p>

<p>For some examples of artistic algorithmic exploration, one can
systematically examine ways to render a space by linked rings.
For the centrally symmetric dodacahedron, for example, by some cleverness in linking, the links can extend to infinity as to fill the whole space with these links, and a cut-away view can be made to result in a artistic image. Or, polygonal tubes can be made to have larger radius, so that each polygonal “side” of the tube is a large flat area that a
Maze
can be incribed upon.
The number of sides of the ring can increase or decrease
according to certain parameters, such as symmetry location or distance
from origin. Or, one can use spheres instead of rings. The coloring of
balls around the dodecahedron can be exploited systematically, so to
result in different symmetry groups of different groups of
balls. Imagine a 3-D space with a cluster of differently colored balls
that exhibits subtly different symmetry groups as in an elaborate
intricate tiling work. Or, imagine 3-D space tiled uniformly by
regular polyhedrons, with some walls open, as to form a 3-dimensional
maze. If well done, a cut-away view or translucent view of this would be fantastic. A
walk-thru as implemented in video games also has great
potential. Solid stacks of cubes is called
Polycube
(a 3-dimensional version of
polymino). Solid block sculptures with other
regular polyhedron are basically unexplored. Block of
connected tetrahedron are particularly interesting.</p>

<p>Below are some examples of polytopes:</p>

L-System
is a recursive symbol-sequence replacement system originally devised to model plant growth. It is often used to generate self-similar images by interpreting the symbol-sequence as drawing commands or geometric objects. Turtle Graphics is from the programing language
Logo, which algorithmically controls the movement of a pen, by specifying directions and pen down or up.
</p>

<p>L-System and Turtle Graphics have been somewhat popular among recreational programers. However, there have not been serious studies of visual art possibilities with these methods. Commonly found are illustration of famous
plane-filling curves
in mathematics, plant-growth modeling, or simplistic symmetric drawings for children as a demo of Logo. Few of them are ingenious.</p>

<h2>Plotting of Functions and Processes</h2>

<p>Many functions in mathematics can be visualized as a plot. For curves and surfaces, the plotting scheme is simple.
Often just on a 2D grid or 3D grid, with marked axes as coordinate. For other functions, such as vector valued functions, complex valued functions, mathematicians have developed other schemes to visualize these functions. Here are some examples.</p>

<p>The main attraction of
Celtic knot
patterns is their geometric design, but the topological aspect (the “knot”) is also interesting mathematically. One can survey traditional designs to see whether they are really knots, or braids of how many strands, and how they are knotted. I'm not sure this has been studied much. There is little systematic study of algorithmic knot/weaving-pattern generations. (There have been systematic mathematical studies of weavings/fabrics by B Grünbaum and G C Shephard).</p>

<p>There are many varieties of pattern designs by different cultures. The decorative Celtic knots and Islamic geometric tilings are particularly mathematical. Although there are great number of existing designs throughout the world and history, but with respect to mathematical or algorithmic classifications, there are not many varieties. This is not surprising when we consider that these artistic patterns are developed culturally by artisans, not as a result of mathematical analysis of plane symmetry or systematic algorithmic exploration.</p>

<p>For plane patterns, it is known since the last century that there are 17 types of symmetries. According to Branko Grünbaum et al [Symmetry in Moorish and Other Ornaments, Comp. and Maths. with appls., Vol. 12B, Nos. 3/4. pp. 641-653, 1986], not all types are found in Alhambra, contrary to popular belief. The mathematical understanding of tilings and patterns is relatively poor even today. It is essentially a unexplored area. The mathematical analysis of weavings is almost completely untouched. (Weaving, as the mathematical content of Celtic knots and Islamic patterns. It can be considered topologically as knots and braids, or as certain uniform lattice network with marked nodes and edges with a geometric layout.)</p>

<p>Penrose tiling is a aperiodic tiling. The discovery of Penrose tiling was a break-thru in mathematics and crystallography with great ramifications (For example, material science). The beauty of aperiodic tilings is that their orderliness is subtle. Such type of beauty was not possible in the past.</p>

<p>Fractals are plots of mathematical objects. They began as a visual aid of a mathematical process. Essentially, each point in the plane is colored according to how that value (x,y) behaves when fed into a formula recursively.</p>

<p>Fractals, by its very nature of garishness and bizarreness, has been extremely popular among computer artists — even those who are not interested in mathematics or computer science. Fractals as a visual art have been explored extensively, and great many varieties and galleries have been created on the web.</p>

<p>The exploration of fractals as a visual art form has somewhat limited expression. Artistic creativity is limited to concocting equations and coloring schemes. Some people have started to mix computer generated fractals with manual manipulations, such as mixing in digitally modified photos. Such artwork ceases being algorithmic or mathematical.</p>

<h2>Higher Dimensions</h2>

<p>As we understand higher dimensional spaces, it opens a great gate of algorithmic art thru the process of projection or slicing of higher dimensional objects to 3-dimensional space or the plane.</p>

<p>Non-Euclidean geometry and higher dimensional geometry and topology are understood by only a few mathematicians in the world. (perhaps a few thousand people, or less if we are specific in the field) Consequently, artistic exploits thru their understanding are basically non-existent. Almost all ideas discussed in this page can be thought about in higher dimensions and or non-Euclidean space. In higher dimensions, there are totally new concepts that are non-existent in lower dimensions. (orientability, embedding, isotropism, etc) As math and technology march on, we may see more visual art explorations thru higher dimensions.</p>

<p>As a example, one idea of creating tilings and patterns is to slice thru some regular lattices of some higher-dimensional manifold. And, we may ask whether it is possible to encode some higher-dimensional manifold properties (such as orientability or the geometry it admits) by a visual exhibition. (i do not quite understand this, but for example, we can illustrate the angle-invariant property of
<a href="http://xahlee.info/SpecialPlaneCurves_dir/Inversion_dir/inversion.html">inversion</a> by showing the
<a href="http://xahlee.info/complex/inv/pre1.png">before</a>
and
<a href="http://xahlee.info/complex/inv/post1.png">after</a>
images of a rectangular grid. We can also show linear and affine transformations by the way they look when applied to a grid. We can show properties of projective transformation and
<a href="http://xahlee.info/SpecialPlaneCurves_dir/ConicSections_dir/conicSections.html">Conic Sections</a> by shadowing. (think of beautiful stained glass in great Cathedrals) We can show
homeomorphism or continuous transformation by animation, especially on tilings. We can color surfaces by their curvature, and draw gridlines along constant curvature lines, and show invariance of curvature such as the

<h2>Evolutionary Programing</h2>

<p>Evolutionary programing
is a emerging method to generate visual art. The method is often done as genetic programing with human arbiter for judging the survival of the fittest. However, most of the investigations done so far over the 1990s tend to be insults to eye with the excuse of being abstract “art”. They are not mathematical.</p>

<p>Cellular Automata
(CA) methods can also be employed for mathematical visual art. Stephen Wolfram's book
A New Kind of Science,
for example, contains many pleasing images of cellular automata, although not for the express purpose of visual art. For example, it is frequently cited that the patterns on sea shells are results of cellular automata.
(<a href="http://xahlee.org/xa/xamsi_calku/ca/DSCN0185m.jpg">seashell photo</a>)
This is a example of using CA for non-mathematical art. (That is, the image does not contain some inherent math structure or appeal.). However, CA probably can be exploited for mathematical art. For example, consider the great varieties of seashell shapes.
(See: <a href="http://xahlee.info/SpecialPlaneCurves_dir/Seashell_dir/index.html">Math of Seashell Shapes</a>)
Some has horns, spikes, ribs. Some are long, some are flat, and there are many types of overall spiraling structure. Seashells are grown from the calcium deposits secreted by the mollusks, and over the years many different shapes emerged thru evolution. Therefore, it is conceivable that a 3-D cellular automata can be set up with genetic programing to simulate the evolutionary process, as to obtain the many shapes of seashells as pure art of mathematical spiraling surfaces.

<h2>M C Escher</h2>

<p>M C Escher (1898 to 1972) is a Dutch artist whose works are predominated by mathematical themes, many of which are purely algorithmic. Although, Escher is a traditional artist; his algorithmic arts are done manually, not by a program from computer, nor with a explicit algorithmic specification.</p>

<p>It is easy to go from algorithms to visual images, but given a algorithmic artwork, it is difficult to extract the algorithm in the form of a precise runnable program. The following two works by M C Escher illustrates this:</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>
<cite>butterfly</cite>
, by M C Escher. This image is clearly purely algorithmic. However, it is not trivial to extract the algorithm involved and turn it into a working program. From a pure minimalist point of view, one should be able to start with half a image of a butterfly, and apply a algorithm recursively to get the final image. Note that the butterfly's wings are colored in such a way that mutually orthogonal circles are formed, and this must be encoded in some way into the algorithm. There are different algorithmic approaches. One can do it by describing pen paths as in Turtle Graphics, or by recursive replacement as in L-Systems. Perhaps a least interesting way is by a mapping process with some mathematical model such as hyperbolic geometry on a rotational-symmetric tiling. Once a algorithm is obtained, one should be able to apply it to various motifs, or tweak parameters to get different effects.

<figcaption>
<cite>Whirlpools</cite>
, by M C Escher. This image is also clearly algorithmic. It consists of a strip of a repeated motif (the fish), wrapped into a double spiral. To generate this image algorithmically, one can start with a motif, reflect and glide-reflect to get a long strip, then use a function that map the strip into a spiral, then mirror to get the other spiral. (or use a function that maps a strip into such double-spirals) Finding the function may not be easy. I imagine to get it right it might take several days tweaking it with functional programing languages such as Mathematica, Lisp, Haskell. Perhaps a more elegant but even more difficult approach is to describe it recursively, which would also deal better with singularities at the center of each spiral.

</figure>

<p>To generate this work algorithmically, one needs to encode the knot process. (i.e. when there is a intersection between 2 circles, which one goes on top.). One also needs to encode the geometric layout, namely, the circle's positions and sizes. Note that circles are smallers near the center, but also gets smaller near the edge. This size change is not linear. Also, note that the circles have 3 different colors. The coloring basically cycle thru as they are spread toward the edge. Also, each of the circle ring has a slant (a thin side), either facing the center or facing the edge.</p>

<h2>What is Algorithmic Mathematical Art</h2>

<p>A visual artwork is <b>mathematical</b> if it appeals to mathematicians and the graphics itself encodes a mathematical structure. For example, M C Escher's tiling works are mathematical art, but some of his other works such as

<i>
<a href="http://xahlee.info/math/algorithmic_math_art/escher/Moebius_Band_II.jpg">Ants Crawling On A Mobius Strip</a>,
Illusions,
<a href="http://xahlee.info/math/algorithmic_math_art/escher/Day_and_Night.jpg">Day And Night</a>,
Forever Loop Stairs</i>, are works of art illustrating
mathematical ideas, but not the mathematical art discussed here.</p>

<p>A visual artwork is <b>algorithmic</b> if it is recursive, symmetric, or embodies a mathematical equation (such as
<a href="http://xahlee.info/SpecialPlaneCurves_dir/specialPlaneCurves.html">curves</a> and
<a href="http://xahlee.info/surface/gallery.html">surfaces</a>). For example, M C Escher's “<a href="http://xahlee.info/math/algorithmic_math_art/escher/escher79butterfly.jpg">Butterfly</a>” and “<a href="http://xahlee.info/math/algorithmic_math_art/escher/whirlpools.jpg">Whirlpools</a>” and his tiling works are algorithmic. All illustrations in this article are algorithmic. Algorithmic art exhibits recursion or symmetry (including quasi-symmetric ones like that of
<a href="http://xahlee.info/math/algorithmic_math_art/penrose2.png">Penrose Tiling</a>
). However, artwork generated by computer programs are not necessarily algorithmic. For example,
<a href="http://xahlee.info/math/algorithmic_math_art/Glasses_pov.png">ray-traced computer generated sceneries</a>,
or digitally retouched fractal artworks, are not considered algorithmic, in our context.</p>

<h3>The Algorithm in Algorithmic Mathematical Artwork</h3>

<p>Algorithmic artwork might not be generated by a computer program. M
C Escher's artwork are examples of algorithmic artwork not generated by
computer programs. Computer generated algorithmic artworks might not be
generated algorithmically either. Here, “algorithmically generated” means
a program that distills the inherent algorithmic nature in a artwork. For
example, many tilings and patterns artwork today are spitted out by computer
programs, but the programs are written in a ad hoc, case-by-case basis,
consisting of drawing commands tweaked to match a desired output. Although
generated by a program, but the essence of creation is manual. What we
really want are programs in a form that embody, capture, or distill the
algorithmic nature of the artwork, as a executable specification by means
of recursion or symmetry code. The beauty of algorithmic artwork lies in
its inherent beauty of algorithmic pattern or symmetry, and its creation
process should be done that way. When this is achieved, and its algorithmic
essence is captured, and we can then create vast numbers of variations
by changing parameters or input. (This does not imply that results will
be similar, as we know from chaos theory.). Generating a algorithmic mathematical
art by a algorithmic process can be likened to specifying a Sequence by
Recursion , or a group by generators and relations , or modeling a physical
phenomen by a equation or cellular automata. It is a pursuit of elegance

The discovery, experts say, could pave the way for new treatments and possibly new methods of screening.</p><p>Colon cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States and is expected to kill more than 53,000 people in the nation in 2024, according to the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank">American Cancer Society</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are rising sharply among younger people: The percentage of people younger than 55 diagnosed with colon cancer <a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21772" target="_blank">almost doubled</a> between 1995 and 2019, leaping from 11% to 20% of cases. What’s more, these cases are often diagnosed at <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/colon-cancer-deaths-younger-men-women-report-rcna134084" target="_blank">later, more aggressive stages</a>.</p><p>Experts are still struggling to explain the shift.</p><p>“Colorectal cancer is very treatable when caught early, but the cases in younger people are increasing and we don’t know why,” said Dr. Flavio Rocha, a surgical oncologist and physician in chief at the Oregon Health &amp; Science University’s Knight Cancer Institute, who was not involved in the study.&nbsp;</p><p>The new research doesn’t answer that question; it’s far too early to implicate this bacteria in the rise in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/colon-cancer-early-signs-symptoms-young-adults-rcna82629" target="_blank">cases in younger people</a>. What’s more, most of the patients in the study were over the age of 50.</p><p>But the findings raise “the question as to whether there are elevated levels of this bacterium in young onset colorectal cancer which is on the rise globally for unknown reasons,” said co-lead study author Susan Bullman, an assistant professor of human biology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle.</p><h2><strong>Bacteria with a secret</strong></h2><p>Scientists have suspected a link between the bacteria, called Fusobacterium nucleatum, and colorectal cancer growth for almost a decade. The bacteria is usually only found in the mouth, far from the colon.&nbsp;</p><p>In the mouth, it’s one of the most common types of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/bad-breath-certain-types-probiotic-bacteria-may-help-rcna62671" target="_blank">disease-causing bacteria</a>, linked to gum disease and plaque buildup. But it was unclear how it could withstand the journey through the gut and eventually invade tumor cells in places in the body where these types of bacteria usually don’t survive.</p><p>In the study, Bullman and her colleagues looked at the bacterial makeup of almost 200 colorectal tumors, as well as stool samples from more than 1,200 people, half of whom did not have cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>What they learned was that the bacteria was a bit more complicated than once thought. Namely, it has two distinct subspecies, one of which appears to shield colorectal tumors from cancer-fighting drugs.&nbsp;</p><p>“It acts like a cloak,” Bullman said.&nbsp;</p><p>Normally, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/two-early-trials-blood-cancer-treatment-appears-promising-deadly-brain-rcna143216" target="_blank">immune cells called T-cells</a> recognize and attack tumor cells. But this bacteria recruits another type of immune cell into the cancer cells, one that lets them escape the T-cells. </p><p>The stealthy subspecies was present in 50% of the colorectal tumors collected in the study. The corresponding stool samples also had elevated amounts of the subspecies, compared to their healthy counterparts.&nbsp;</p><p>“Patients who have high levels of this bacteria in their colorectal tumors have a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/colon-cancer-advanced-younger-symptoms-rcna72983" target="_blank">far worse prognosis</a>,” Bullman said. “They don’t respond as well to chemotherapy and they have an increased risk of recurrence.”&nbsp;</p><p>The subspecies may also cause cancer to form in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>When Bullman and her team transplanted the subspecies to mice, they appeared to cause precancerous polyps to form, one of the first warning signs of colorectal cancer, though she added that this causation hasn’t yet been proven in humans.</p><p>The researchers also found clues that may answer the question as to how Fusobacterium nucleatum can get to the colon in the first place: The bacterium appears to be able to survive the journey through the stomach, withstanding what scientists previously thought would be a toxic dose of stomach acid.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>New targets for treatment</strong></h2><p>The discovery of the subspecies has huge consequences for targeted therapies that are already underway, said Dr. Michael White, an assistant professor of colorectal surgery at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.</p><p>“There is evidence that if you clear these bacteria, there is more response during treatment,” said White, who was not involved with the new research. Clinical trials are slated to soon test whether treating a patient with antibiotics prior to chemotherapy will induce a better response, he said.</p><p>Knowing more about which bacterial subspecies, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, are dangerous will allow for a more targeted approach, he said.&nbsp;</p><p>That could potentially include prevention.</p><p>It’s possible that scientists could identify the subspecies while it’s still in the mouth and give a person antibiotics at that point, wiping it out before it could&nbsp; travel&nbsp; to the colon, Bullman said. Even if antibiotics can’t successfully eliminate the bacteria from the mouth, its presence there could serve as an indication that someone is at higher risk for aggressive colon cancer, she added.&nbsp;</p><p>Rocha agreed. In the future, part of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/colon-cancer-screening-blood-test-coming-approval-rcna143066" target="_blank">colorectal cancer screening</a> could be as simple as a mouth swab, he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Understanding the newly identified subspecies could also lead to the development of new antibiotics that would specifically target this bacterial subtype, rather than wiping out both forms of the bacteria or all of the bacteria in the mouth.</p><p>There’s also the possibility of harnessing the bacteria to do the cancer-fighting work.&nbsp;</p><p>The subtype has already proven that it can enter cancer cells quite easily, so it might be possible to genetically modify the bacteria to carry cancer-fighting drugs directly into the tumors, Bullman said.</p><p>Researchers are just beginning to scratch the surface of the ways a person’s microbiome plays a role in the individual’s cancer risk, Rocha said, but it’s one of the most important concepts being explored in cancer research today.</p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><p><span data-testid="byline-thumbnail"></span><span data-testid="byline-name">Kaitlin Sullivan</span><span></span></p><p>Kaitlin Sullivan is a contributor for NBCNews.com who has worked with NBC News Investigations.&nbsp;She reports on health, science and the environment and&nbsp;is a graduate of the&nbsp;Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at City University of New York.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                Memories stores most of the metadata in the EXIF headers of your photos, which means
                that you can easily migrate to other solutions without losing your data. It also utilizes
                your existing filesystem structure for organization without converting it to any
                specialized format.

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>Recently, I’ve been interested in the <a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> project (like a <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> geared towards data applications). And one of the amazing features is that it has many data importers included without requiring extra dependencies. This means it can natively read and parse JSON as a database table, among many other formats.</p>

<p>I work extensively with JSON day to day, and I often reach for <a href="https://jqlang.github.io/jq/">jq</a> when exploring documents. I love <code>jq</code>, but I find it hard to use. The syntax is super powerful, but I have to study the docs anytime I want to do anything beyond just selecting fields.</p>

<!-- I love [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) for wrangling JSON data, but I find it hard to use. The syntax is super powerful, but I have to read the docs anytime I want to do anything beyond just selecting fields. -->

<p>Once I learned DuckDB could read JSON files directly into memory, I realized that I could use it for many of the things where I’m currently using <code>jq</code>. In contrast to the complicated and custom <code>jq</code> syntax, I’m very familiar with SQL and use it almost daily.</p>

<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<p>First, we fetch some sample JSON to play around with. I used the GitHub API to grab the repository information from the golang org:</p>

<div><pre><code>% curl <span>'https://api.github.com/orgs/golang/repos'</span> <span>&gt;</span> repos.json
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, as a sample question to answer, let’s get some stats on the types of open source licenses used.</p>

<p>The JSON structure looks like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1914329</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"gddo"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"license"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"key"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"bsd-3-clause"</span><span>,</span><span>
      </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"BSD 3-Clause </span><span>\"</span><span>New</span><span>\"</span><span> or </span><span>\"</span><span>Revised</span><span>\"</span><span> License"</span><span>,</span><span>
      </span><span>...</span><span>
    </span><span>},</span><span>
    </span><span>...</span><span>
  </span><span>},</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>11440704</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"glog"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"license"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"key"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"apache-2.0"</span><span>,</span><span>
      </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Apache License 2.0"</span><span>,</span><span>
      </span><span>...</span><span>
    </span><span>},</span><span>
    </span><span>...</span><span>
  </span><span>},</span><span>
  </span><span>...</span><span>
</span><span>]</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This might not be the best way, but here is what I cobbled together after searching and reading some docs for how to do this in <code>jq</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code> % <span>cat </span>repos.json | jq <span>\</span>
  <span>'group_by(.license.key)
  | map({license: .[0].license.key, count: length})
  | sort_by(.count)
  | reverse'</span>
<span>[</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>"license"</span>: <span>"bsd-3-clause"</span>,
    <span>"count"</span>: 23
  <span>}</span>,
  <span>{</span>
    <span>"license"</span>: <span>"apache-2.0"</span>,
    <span>"count"</span>: 5
  <span>}</span>,
  <span>{</span>
    <span>"license"</span>: null,
    <span>"count"</span>: 2
  <span>}</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And here is what it looks like in DuckDB using SQL:</p>

<div><pre><code>% duckdb <span>-c</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>"select license-&gt;&gt;'key' as license, count(*) as count </span><span>\</span><span>
  from 'repos.json' </span><span>\</span><span>
  group by 1 </span><span>\</span><span>
  order by count desc"</span>
┌──────────────┬───────┐
│   license    │ count │
│   varchar    │ int64 │
├──────────────┼───────┤
│ bsd-3-clause │    23 │
│ apache-2.0   │     5 │
│              │     2 │
└──────────────┴───────┘
</code></pre></div>

<p>For me, this SQL is much simpler and I was able to write it without looking at any docs. The only tricky part is querying nested JSON with the <code>-&gt;&gt;</code> operator. The syntax is the same as the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html">PostgreSQL JSON Functions</a>, however, so I was familiar with it.</p>

<p>And if we do need the output in JSON, there’s a DuckDB flag for that:</p>

<div><pre><code>% duckdb <span>-json</span> <span>-c</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>"select license-&gt;&gt;'key' as license, count(*) as count </span><span>\</span><span>
  from 'repos.json' </span><span>\</span><span>
  group by 1 </span><span>\</span><span>
  order by count desc"</span>
<span>[{</span><span>"license"</span>:<span>"bsd-3-clause"</span>,<span>"count"</span>:23<span>}</span>,
<span>{</span><span>"license"</span>:<span>"apache-2.0"</span>,<span>"count"</span>:5<span>}</span>,
<span>{</span><span>"license"</span>:null,<span>"count"</span>:2<span>}]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can still even pretty print with <code>jq</code> at the end, after using DuckDB to do the heavy lifting:</p>

<div><pre><code>% duckdb <span>-json</span> <span>-c</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>"select license-&gt;&gt;'key' as license, count(*) as count </span><span>\</span><span>
  from 'repos.json' </span><span>\</span><span>
  group by 1 </span><span>\</span><span>
  order by count desc"</span> <span>\</span>
  | jq
<span>[</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>"license"</span>: <span>"bsd-3-clause"</span>,
    <span>"count"</span>: 23
  <span>}</span>,
  <span>{</span>
    <span>"license"</span>: <span>"apache-2.0"</span>,
    <span>"count"</span>: 5
  <span>}</span>,
  <span>{</span>
    <span>"license"</span>: null,
    <span>"count"</span>: 2
  <span>}</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>JSON is just one of the many ways of importing data into DuckDB. This same approach would work for CSVs, parquet, Excel files, etc.</p>

<p>And I could choose to create tables and persist locally, but often I’m just interrogating data and don’t need the persistence.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Silent Running </em>(1972) </strong>Directed by Douglas Trumbull. Starring Bruce Dern. Screenplay by Deric Washburn, Michael Cimino, and Steven Bochco.</p>
<hr>
<p>For just a moment, let’s time travel back to the summer of 1962. In the U.S., John F. Kennedy is president and committed to sending astronauts to the moon. Dodger Stadium is brand new. The Supreme Court issues rulings declaring mandatory prayer in schools unconstitutional and decriminalizing nude photographs of men. The Cuban Missile Crisis is lurking just a few months in the future. And, starting in June as a lead-up to a September publication, <em>The New Yorker</em> begins serializing a little book called <em>Silent Spring, </em>in which marine biologist and conservationist Rachel Carson documents research into the harmful effects of man-made pesticides on the natural world.</p>
<p><em>Silent Spring</em> had a huge and immediate impact on the American public, which Carson and her publisher, Houghton Mifflin, had very much expected and prepared for. There was somewhat panicked pushback from the U.S. government and chemical industry giants like DuPont and Monsanto, but all of that only made <em>Silent Spring</em> more influential in public opinion. A culture of unchecked growth and technological development had dominated life in the U.S. since the end of WWII, and Carson’s book was one of the many catalysts that prompted people to seriously ask if all that progress was doing more harm than good.</p>
<p>The environmental movement picked up momentum over the next decade. By the end of the 1960s, the Environmental Defense Fund, founded as a direct response to <em>Silent Spring</em>, was actively filing lawsuits to end use of the pesticide DDT. The first Earth Day was declared in 1970; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was established that same year. Environmental concerns were in the news, in the halls of government, in the courtrooms, and in the public consciousness. It’s no surprise that those themes showed up in movie theaters as well.</p>
<p>Humanity’s impact on the natural world—whether our own Earth or other worlds—has always been a part of science fiction, but <em>Silent Running</em> was not initially meant to be an environmental story at all. Douglas Trumbull had recently finished working with Stanley Kubrick, creating the special effects for <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, so he had big, thoughtful, serious science fiction on his mind when he first starting putting <em>Silent Running</em> together. His earliest conception of the film was about first contact with an alien civilization.</p>
<p>But it evolved, as stories tend to do, and what he ended up with is an environmental fable that simply—and not remotely subtly—calls out the dysfunction in humanity’s relationship with nature. Trumbull had never directed a film before, and in fact he would only direct one more feature in his life. (That would be <em>Brainstorm</em> (1983), which is largely remembered now for being Natalie Wood’s last movie, as she died during production.) What Trumbull is mostly known for is his absolutely legendary special effects work on some of Hollywood’s most influential sci fi films: <em>2001</em>, <em>Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em>, <em>Blade Runner.</em> So much of how we imagine science fiction to look comes from Trumbull’s special effects work.</p>
<p>Here are some fun details about how <em>Silent Running </em>was made, which I share for no real reason other than the fact that I love learning about this stuff and hope you do too:</p>
<ul>
<li>The exterior shots of <em>Valley Forge</em> and the other ships use a 25-foot model built from wood, metal, and plastic, with much of the mechanical detailing coming from literally hundreds of model kits of WWII airplanes and tanks.</li>
<li>For the interior, Trumbull made a deal with the U.S. Navy to film inside the aircraft carrier <em>USS Valley Forge</em>, which was waiting to be decommissioned and scrapped at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard.</li>
<li>The forests were filmed inside a hangar at the Van Nuys Airport, and many scenes with the stars and domes were done “in-camera,” that is, using projected footage in the live scene, rather than added afterward during processing.</li>
<li>And, finally, the three robotic drones—Huey, Dewey, and Louie—are not mechanical at all, but are actors in costume: Mark Persons, Cheryl Sparks, Steven Brown, and Larry Whisenhunt, all double amputees. (Additional fun fact: A few years later, George Lucas would direct Ralph McQuarrie to consider the <em>Silent Running</em> drones as an example of what he wanted R2-D2 to look like.)</li>
</ul>
<p>On that note, if the business and craft of making sci fi movies in ’70s Hollywood interests you, I recommend Trumbull’s lengthy <a href="https://archive.org/details/Fantastic_Films_003_August_1978_vol1_no3_c2c-Tranzor-HQS/page/n5/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1978 interview with <em>Fantastic Films Magazine</em></a>.</p>
<p>Trumbull was inspired by working on <em>2001</em>, but he wasn’t working with <em>2001 </em>money. As a result the practical effects in <em>Silent Running </em>are a great example of doing a lot on a comparatively limited budget, just by looking around Los Angeles and getting creative with what was available. (We are talking about more than a million dollars; this is Hollywood budgeting, not normal people budgeting.) And the film still looks really, really good. The ship exterior is visually interesting, the sense of interior space is convincing, and the images of the darkness of space outside the forest domes are hauntingly effective.</p>
<p>But let’s be real. The most important special effect in <em>Silent Running</em> is Bruce Dern’s crazy eyes.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IAeTg6nGQEk?si=hGaFt5a8eA2ztgby" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Dern plays Freeman Lowell, a man who has spent the better part of a decade aboard the spaceship <em>Valley Forge, </em>caring for the last remnants of Earth’s flora and forests. The film doesn’t explain why the last pieces of nature have been enclosed in domes and launched into space aboard American Airlines spacecraft—and I have questions about what the hell American Airlines was thinking with this sponsorship, because it does not make them look good. We learn that there are no trees or plants left on Earth, no parks or wild areas, no places where kids can dig in the dirt or run through the grass. There is also, apparently, “…hardly any disease. No poverty. And everybody has a job.” Everything has been replaced by absolute uniformity: everywhere is 75 degrees Fahrenheit and everybody looks and acts the same. (Feel free to insert your own joke about Hollywood here.)</p>
<p>The film doesn’t dig deeply into any of this; these details emerge when the characters are arguing. I’m skeptical enough to doubt fictional characters when they claim the world has no poverty or disease, nor am I entirely convinced the audience is supposed to buy it. (The whole world? Or just the world of white guys working corporate space jobs? I have questions.) It’s vague and muddled worldbuilding anyway, so we won’t dwell on it. Whatever the intent, as a person who likes trees and seasons a lot more than I like being an anonymous cog in the grinding wheels of capitalism, I agree with Lowell that this future Earth sounds pretty bleak. But even bleaker is the fact that of the few characters we meet in the film, only Lowell believes it’s a situation than can be changed.</p>
<p>When <em>Valley Forge </em>and its fleet receive orders to destroy the precious forests and return to Earth, with no explanation except that it’s time they get on with the business of commercial shipping, Lowell is crushed, but the other members of the expedition are happy to be going home. They acknowledge that it’s kinda sad to destroy the last of Earth’s forests, but to them it’s inevitable. They don’t even question that they’re doing it just so their bosses can make more money using the ships for something else. There’s no point in trying to fight it, or dream about a different world. One of them says, “The fact is, Lowell, if people were interested, something would have been done a long time ago.”</p>
<p>I’ll pause there to let everybody wince before we move on.</p>
<p>Lowell decides to do something about it. What he decides to do is murder: he kills his three crewmates to stop them from jettisoning the last forest dome, then stages an explosion so the other ships in the fleet think he’s suffering some sort of catastrophic mechanical failure. He sets course for Saturn, hoping to run away far enough that the other ships don’t follow.</p>
<p>Because Lowell is the only character on screen for the majority of the film, so much of the movie depends on how Dern plays him. Contemporaneous reviews of the film had some mixed opinions about Dern’s portrayal, but I come down on the side of loving it. Even before things start to go wrong, he’s wide-eyed and strident, soft-spoken but intense, and more than a little sanctimonious. His crew uniform has a prominent Smokey the Bear patch on it, but when he’s working in the forest dome he wears a loose robe to talk to rabbits and birds, like some sort of space-age St. Francis of Assisi, complete with Joan Baez on the soundtrack. (The music was composed by Peter Schickele, better known as musical satirist P.D.Q. Bach; Diane Lampert wrote the lyrics to the songs Baez sings.) He’s a hippie, a wild man of the woods, a bedraggled mystic, a wise hermit. He’s committed to his counterculture perspective. He’s an insufferable dinner companion.</p>
<p>The fact that he’s right about what a terrible decision it is to destroy the forests has nothing to do with how he comes across; there is no effort here to artificially link righteousness or morality with likability. Lowell’s crewmates are good-natured and affable—they’re also the ones who laugh while blowing up cute little bunnies with nuclear bombs.</p>
<p>But they are Lowell’s fellow humans and almost-friends, and their deaths weigh on his conscience, even though he believes he made the right choice. The way he unravels as the film goes on is fascinating, because he uses the robotic drones to replace the crew. He reprograms them to follow his lead when it comes to work, but also to keep him company in poker games. He even has them bury the corpse of a former human crewmate, just in case the symbolism wasn’t clear enough. (About the poker: A computer scientist by the name of Nicholas Findler was programming computers to play poker in the 1970s—there may have been others, but his research articles were the ones that came up when I dug around—so this element wasn’t actually very futuristic at the time, just a few years on the early side.)</p>
<p>This progression grows more unsettling when Lowell teaches the drones to care for the forest, recalling the children of Earth who will never have a chance to climb a tree or play in grass. It’s interesting to me that the drones are never actually proven to have any personality or human characteristics; Lowell’s perception is what anthropomorphizes them. And when we get to the end of the film, Lowell uses the last drone to replace himself as the final caretaker of Earth’s forests. Humans may be willing to save themselves—after all, the other ship shows up to rescue Lowell, even after he assumed they would abandon him—but they can’t be trusted with the last scrap of Earth’s forests. That’s up to one little robot with a watering can.</p>

<p><em>Silent Running</em> is far from a perfect movie. If we started listing the scientific inaccuracies we would be here all day. In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/28/archives/growing-up-with.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1978 <em>New York Times</em> piece about science fiction</a>, Carl Sagan wrote, “Trumbull’s characters are able to build interplanetary cities but have forgotten <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the inverse‐square law</a>. I was willing to overlook the portrayal of the rings of Saturn as pastel‐colored gases, but not this.” And, really, that about sums it up. Science fiction often has very silly science.</p>
<p>But as a fable about man’s relationship to the natural world, the film is anything but silly. It’s heavy and melancholy, even more so now, fifty-two years of escalating climate crisis later, than it was upon release. <em>Silent Running</em> was a modest success at the time, sandwiched as it was in an era of some of the biggest, flashiest, most genre-defining sci fi films to come out of Hollywood, but it’s easy to see why it’s maintained a long-lasting cult status, even as its style of earnest and heavy-handed moral commentary has fallen out of style.</p>
<p>There are a lot of climate crisis stories in modern sci fi, but a great many of them focus, intentionally or not, on the natural world’s utility to humans: we must preserve it or else we doom ourselves. <em>Silent Running </em>argues that we should preserve the natural world even if we can live without it, even if it serves no purpose in feeding the hungry or curing the ill, even if we can find a way to get along just fine. That’s a less common philosophy in environmental sci fi, and it’s one of the reasons I find this film so interesting.</p>
<p>One last note: On the wall besides Lowell’s bunk is a copy of something called the “Conservation Pledge,” which dates back to 1946, when the magazine <a href="https://www.outdoorlife.com/blogs/out-there/outdoor-life-archives-70-year-anniversary-ol-conservation-pledge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Outdoor Life</em></a> held a contest to encourage outdoors enthusiasts to dedicate themselves to the preservation of the America’s natural resources. The winning entry, the one that adorns Lowell’s wall aboard <em>Valley Forge</em>, was submitted by L.L. Foreman, a former ranch hand turned author of pulpy adventure Westerns.</p>
<p>The second-place winner of that 1946 contest? Rachel Carson.</p>

<p><strong>Next week:</strong> We’re traveling back into deep space with another (loose) adaptation of a Stanislaw Lem novel, traveling to a distant planet aboard the spaceship <em>Ikarie XB-1</em>. Watch it on <a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/ikarie-xb-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Criterion</a>, <a href="https://www.cultpix.com/movie/ikarie-xb-1/1069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cultpix</a> (some locations), <a href="https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-ikarie-xb-1-1963-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">British Film Institute</a> (UK only), and I suspect you all know how to poke around the internet for other options, if you need to. If the version you stumble across is the American dubbed release titled <em>Voyage to the End of the Universe</em>, take note that it has a different cut and ending.<svg width="31" height="13" viewBox="0 0 31 13" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-labelledby="icon-paragraph-end">

Being built on Vite also means you can directly leverage Vite plugins from its rich ecosystem. In addition, VitePress provides flexible APIs to <a href="https://vitepress.dev/guide/data-loading" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">load data</a> (local or remote) and <a href="https://vitepress.dev/guide/routing#dynamic-routes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dynamically generate routes</a> at build time. You can use it to build almost anything as long as the data can be determined at build time.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/vuejs/blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">This very blog</a> is built with VitePress' custom theme and data loading API.</p></li></ul><h2 id="developer-experience" tabindex="-1">Developer experience <a href="#developer-experience" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Developer experience&quot;">​</a></h2><p>VitePress aims to provide a great Developer Experience (DX) when working with Markdown content.</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vite-Powered:</a></strong> instant server start, with edits always instantly reflected (&lt;100ms) without page reload.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://vitepress.dev/guide/markdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Built-in Markdown Extensions:</a></strong> Frontmatter, tables, syntax highlighting... you name it.

You can embed interactivity in your static content using Vue templating features or imported Vue components.</p></li></ul><h2 id="performance" tabindex="-1">Performance <a href="#performance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Performance&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Unlike many traditional SSGs where each navigation results in a full page reload, a website generated by VitePress serves static HTML on the initial visit, but becomes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Single Page Application</a> (SPA) for subsequent navigation within the site. This model, in our opinion, provides an optimal balance for performance:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Fast Initial Load</strong></p><p>The initial visit to any page will be served the static, pre-rendered HTML for fast loading speed and optimal SEO. The page then loads a JavaScript bundle that turns the page into a Vue SPA ("hydration"). Contrary to common assumptions of SPA hydration being slow, this process is actually extremely fast thanks to Vue 3's raw performance and compiler optimizations. On <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvitepress.dev%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PageSpeed Insights</a>, typical VitePress sites achieve near-perfect performance scores even on low-end mobile devices with a slow network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fast Post-load Navigation</strong></p><p>More importantly, the SPA model leads to better user experience <strong>after</strong> the initial load. Subsequent navigation within the site will no longer cause a full page reload. Instead, the incoming page's content will be fetched and dynamically updated. VitePress also automatically pre-fetches page chunks for links that are within viewport. In most cases, post-load navigation will feel instant.</p></li><li><p><strong>Interactivity Without Penalty</strong></p><p>To be able to hydrate the dynamic Vue parts embedded inside static Markdown, each Markdown page is processed as a Vue component and compiled into JavaScript. This may sound inefficient, but the Vue compiler is smart enough to separate the static and dynamic parts, minimizing both the hydration cost and payload size. For the initial page load, the static parts are automatically eliminated from the JavaScript payload and skipped during hydration.</p></li></ul><hr><p>The path to VitePress 1.0 wouldn't have been possible without the hard work of <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">our contributors</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>When thousands of security researchers descend on Las Vegas every August for what's come to be known as “hacker summer camp,” the back-to-back <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/black-hat/">Black Hat</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/defcon/">Defcon</a> hacker conferences, it's a given that some of them will experiment with hacking the infrastructure of Vegas itself, the city's elaborate array of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/card-shuffler-hack/">casino</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elevator-phone-phreaking-defcon/">hospitality</a> technology. But at one private event in 2022, a select group of researchers were actually <em>invited</em> to hack a Vegas hotel room, competing in a suite crowded with their laptops and cans of Red Bull to find digital vulnerabilities in every one of the room's gadgets, from its TV to its bedside VoIP phone.</p><p>One team of hackers spent those days focused on the lock on the room's door, perhaps its most sensitive piece of technology of all. Now, more than a year and a half later, they're finally bringing to light the results of that work: a technique they discovered that would allow an intruder to open any of millions of hotel rooms worldwide in seconds, with just two taps.</p><p>Today, Ian Carroll, Lennert Wouters, and a team of other security researchers are revealing a hotel keycard hacking technique they call <a data-offer-url="https://unsaflok.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://unsaflok.com/&quot;}" href="https://unsaflok.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Unsaflok</a>. The technique is a collection of security vulnerabilities that would allow a hacker to almost instantly open several models of Saflok-brand RFID-based keycard locks sold by the Swiss lock maker Dormakaba. The Saflok systems are installed on 3 million doors worldwide, inside 13,000 properties in 131 countries.</p><p>By exploiting weaknesses in both Dormakaba's encryption and the underlying RFID system Dormakaba uses, known as MIFARE Classic, Carroll and Wouters have demonstrated just how easily they can open a Saflok keycard lock. Their technique starts with obtaining any keycard from a target hotel—say, by booking a room there or grabbing a keycard out of a box of used ones—then reading a certain code from that card with a $300 RFID read-write device, and finally writing two keycards of their own. When they merely tap those two cards on a lock, the first rewrites a certain piece of the lock's data, and the second opens it.</p><p>“Two quick taps and we open the door,” says Wouters, a researcher in the Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography group at the KU Leuven University in Belgium. “And that works on every door in the hotel.”</p><figure><p><span>A video of the researchers demonstrating their lock-hacking technique. (The pattern of lights shown on the lock is redacted at one point at the researchers’ request to avoid revealing a detail of their technique they agreed with Dormakaba not to make public.)</span><span>Video: Ian Carroll</span></p></figure><p>Wouters and Carroll, an independent security researcher and founder of travel website Seats.aero, shared the full technical details of their hacking technique with Dormakaba in November 2022. Dormakaba says that it's been working since early last year to make hotels that use Saflok aware of their security flaws and to help them fix or replace the vulnerable locks. For many of the Saflok systems sold in the last eight years, there's no hardware replacement necessary for each individual lock. Instead, hotels will only need to update or replace the front desk management system and have a technician carry out a relatively quick reprogramming of each lock, door by door.</p><p>Wouters and Carroll say they were nonetheless told by Dormakaba that, as of this month, only 36 percent of installed Safloks have been updated. Given that the locks aren't connected to the internet and some older locks will still need a hardware upgrade, they say the full fix will still likely take months longer to roll out, at the very least. Some older installations may take years.</p><p>“We have worked closely with our partners to identify and implement an immediate mitigation for this vulnerability, along with a longer-term solution,” Dormakaba wrote to WIRED in a statement, though it declined to detail what that “immediate mitigation” might be. “Our customers and partners all take security very seriously, and we are confident all reasonable steps will be taken to address this matter in a responsible way.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The technique to hack Dormakaba's locks that Wouters and Carroll's research group discovered involves two distinct kinds of vulnerabilities: One that allows them to write to its keycards, and one that allows them to know <em>what</em> data to write to the cards to successfully trick a Saflok lock into opening. When they analyzed Saflok keycards, they saw that they use the MIFARE Classic RFID system, which has been known for more than a decade to have vulnerabilities that allow hackers to write to keycards, though the brute-force process can take as long as 20 seconds. They then cracked a part of Dormakaba's own encryption system, its so-called key derivation function, which allowed them to write to its cards far faster. With either of those tricks, the researchers could then copy a Saflok keycard at will, but still not generate one for a different room.</p><p>The researchers' more crucial step required them to obtain one of the lock programming devices that Dormakaba distributes to hotels, as well as a copy of its front desk software for managing keycards. By reverse engineering that software, they were able to understand all the data stored on the cards, pulling out a hotel property code as well as a code for each individual room, then create their own values and encrypt them just as Dormakaba's system would, allowing them to spoof a working master key that opens any room on the property. “You can make a card that really looks as if it was created by the software from Dormakaba, essentially,” says Wouters.</p><p>And how did Carroll and Wouters obtain Dormakaba's front desk software? “We nicely asked a few people,” Wouters says. “Manufacturers assume that no one will sell their equipment on eBay, and that no one will make a copy of their software, and those assumptions, I think everyone knows, are not really valid.”</p><p>Once they'd managed all that reverse engineering work, the final version of their attack could be pulled off with little more than a $300 Proxmark RFID read-write device and a couple of blank RFID cards, an Android phone, or a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-flipper-zero-tiktok/">Flipper Zero radio hacking tool</a>.</p><figure><p><span><p>A Saflok branded lock.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: Dormakaba</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The biggest caveat to the hackers' Unsaflok technique is that it still requires that they have a keycard—even an expired one—for a room somewhere in the same hotel as the room they're targeting. That's because each card has a property-specific code they need to read and then duplicate on their spoofed card, as well as a room-specific one.</p><p>Once they have that property code, the technique also requires using an RFID read-write device to write two cards—one card that reprograms a target lock as well as the second spoofed card that unlocks it. (An Android phone or a Flipper Zero could also be used to emit one signal after another instead of the two cards, the researchers say.) The researchers hint that the first card allows them to open a target room without guessing its unique identifier in the hotel's system, but declined to say exactly what that first card does. They're holding that element of the technique in confidence to avoid giving too clear a set of instructions to would-be intruders or thieves.</p><p>By contrast, one security researcher presented a similar hotel keycard hack that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/07/23/hacker-will-expose-potential-security-flaw-in-more-than-four-million-hotel-room-keycard-locks/?sh=78d51b9eeb85">opened locks sold by the firm Onity</a> at the Black Hat conference in 2012 with no such obfuscation, and allowed any hacker to build a device that opened any of Onity's 10 million locks worldwide. When Onity refused to pay for the hardware upgrades necessary to solve the problem and instead put the onus on its customers, the issue remained unfixed in many hotels—and eventually was exploited in at least <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/08/the-hotel-hacker/">one hacker's cross-country burglary spree</a>.</p><p>Carroll and Wouters say that they're trying to avoid that scenario by taking a more cautious approach, while still warning the public about their technique, given that hundreds of properties will likely remain vulnerable to it even now that Dormakaba has offered its fix. “We're trying to find the middle ground of helping Dormakaba to fix it quickly, but also telling the guests about it," says Carroll. “If someone else reverse engineers this today and starts exploiting it before people are aware, that might be an even bigger problem.”</p><p>To that end, Carroll and Wouters point out that hotel guests can recognize the vulnerable locks most often—but not always—by their distinct design: a round RFID reader with a wavy line cutting through it. They suggest that if hotel guests do have a Saflok on their door, they can determine if it's been updated by checking their keycard with the NFC Taginfo app by NXP, available for <a data-offer-url="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-taginfo-by-nxp/id1246143596" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-taginfo-by-nxp/id1246143596&quot;}" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-taginfo-by-nxp/id1246143596" rel="noopener" target="_blank">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nxp.taginfolite&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android</a>. If the lock is manufactured by Dormakaba, and that app shows that the keycard is still a MIFARE Classic card, it's likely still vulnerable.</p><p>If that's the case, the two researchers say, there's not much to do other than avoid leaving valuables in the room and, when you're inside, bolt the chain on the door. They warn that the deadbolt on the room is also controlled by the keycard lock, so it doesn't provide an extra safeguard. “If someone locks the deadbolt, they’re still not protected,” says Carroll.</p><p>Even without a perfect or fully implemented fix, Wouters and Carroll argue, it's better for hotel guests to know the risks than to have a false sense of security. After all, they point out, the Saflok brand has been sold for more than three decades, and may have been vulnerable for much or all of those years. Though Dormakaba says it's not aware of any past use of Wouters and Carroll's technique, the researchers point out that doesn't mean it never happened in secret.</p><p>“We think the vulnerability has been there for a long time,” says Wouters. “It's unlikely that we are the first to find this.”</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

								<p>
									The GoFetch attack is based on a CPU feature 
									called data memory-dependent prefetcher (DMP), 
									which is present in the latest Apple processors. 
									We reverse-engineered DMPs on Apple m-series CPUs 
									and found that the DMP activates (and attempts to dereference) 
									data loaded from memory that "looks like" a pointer. 
									This explicitly violates a requirement 
									of the constant-time programming paradigm, 
									which forbids mixing data and memory access patterns. 
								</p>
								<p>
									To exploit the DMP, we craft chosen inputs to cryptographic operations, 
									in a way where pointer-like values only appear 
									if we have correctly guessed some bits of the secret key. 
									We verify these guesses by monitoring whether the DMP performs 
									a dereference through cache-timing analysis. 
									Once we make a correct guess, we proceed to guess the next batch of key bits. 
									Using this approach, we show end-to-end key extraction attacks on popular 
									constant-time implementations of classical 
									(OpenSSL Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, Go RSA decryption) 
									and post-quantum cryptography (CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium).
								</p>
							</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseDifference" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingDifference">
							<p>
								We have mounted end-to-end GoFetch attacks on Apple hardware equipped with m1 processors. 
								We also tested DMP activation patterns on other Apple processors 
								and found that m2 and m3 CPUs also exhibit similar exploitable DMP behavior. 
								While we have not tested other m-series variants (e.g., m2 Pro, etc), 
								we hypothesize that since these parts have the same microarchitecture as their simpler counterparts, 
								they are likewise equipped with exploitable DMPs. 
								Finally, we found that Intel's 13th Gen Raptor Lake microarchitecture also features a DMP. 
								However, its activation criteria are more restrictive, making it robust to our attacks.
							</p>
						</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseCacheAttack" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingCacheAttack">
								<p>
									The Apple m-series DMP was first discovered by <a href="https://www.prefetchers.info/">Augury</a>, 
									which suggested that DMPs might mix data and addresses under some conditions. 
									However, we found that the DMP activation criteria outlined by Augury are overly restrictive. 
									This prevents Augury's findings from being sufficient to mount attacks on real-world constant-time cryptography. 
								</p>
								<p>
									GoFetch shows that the DMP is significantly more aggressive than previously thought, 
									and thus poses a much greater security risk. 
									Specifically, we find that any value loaded from memory is a candidate for being dereferenced (literally!). 
									This allows us to sidestep many of Augury's limitations and demonstrate end-to-end attacks on real constant-time code.
								</p>
							</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseConstantTime" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingConstantTime">
							<p>
								Modern processors use caches to reduce a program's memory access latency. 
								If data has been accessed before, it gets cached, which makes subsequent accesses to it faster. 
								Since the cache is shared by processes running on the same machine, 
								attackers co-located to the same machine can monitor the cache's state to deduce a victim's access pattern.
							</p>
						</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseDMP" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingDMP">
								<p>
									Constant-time programming is a paradigm that aims to harden code against side-channel attacks by ensuring that all operations take the same amount of time, regardless of their operands. In particular, constant-time code cannot contain secret-dependent branches, loops, or other control structures. Moreover, as the CPU caches different addresses with attacker-observable latency, constant-time code cannot mix data and addresses in any way and prohibits the use of secret-dependent memory accesses or array indices.
								</p>
								<p>
									We show that even if a victim correctly separates data from addresses by following the constant-time paradigm, the DMP will generate secret-dependent memory access on the victim's behalf, resulting in variable-time code susceptible to our key-extraction attacks. 
								</p>
							</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseOther" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingOther">
							<p>
								Prefetchers are a hardware optimization that predicts memory addresses accessed in the near future and fetch the data into the cache accordingly from the main memory. To make a prediction, classical prefetchers use the address trace of previous demand accesses. This strategy performs poorly when it comes to irregular access patterns like linked-list traversals. Aiming to handle such irregular patterns, data memory-dependent prefetchers (DMPs) also consider the content of memory to determine what to fetch, which is capable of capturing those indirect access patterns. Unfortunately, this behavior inherently mixes data and memory addresses at the hardware level, making the entire compute stack non-constant-time, enabling our attack.
							</p>
						</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseOthers" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingOthers">
							<p>
								We don't know. Our attack relies on the fact that it is possible to craft inputs to control specific intermediate states, making them contain memory addresses in a key-dependent way. The DMP then serves as an oracle, allowing us to learn if the intermediate state indeed looks like a pointer and thus leaks secret key bits. Unfortunately, to assess if an implementation is vulnerable, cryptanalysis and code inspection are required to understand when and how intermediate values can be made to look like pointers in a way that leaks secrets. This process is manual and slow and does not rule out other attack approaches. 
							</p>
						</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseDisable" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingDisable">
							<p>
								Yes, but only on some processors.
								We observe that the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/writing-arm64-code-for-apple-platforms#Enable-DIT-for-constant-time-cryptographic-operations">DIT bit</a>
								set on m3 CPUs effectively disables the DMP.
								This is not the case for the m1 and m2.
								Also, Intel's counterpart, <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/best-practices/data-operand-independent-timing-isa-guidance.html">DOIT bit</a>, 
								can be used to disable DMP on the Raptor Lake processors.
							</p>
						</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseCountermeasure" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingCountermeasure">
							<p>
								For users, we recommend using the latest versions of software, 
								as well as performing updates regularly. 
								Developers of cryptographic libraries can either set the 
								<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/best-practices/data-operand-independent-timing-isa-guidance.html">DOIT bit</a>
								and 
								<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/writing-arm64-code-for-apple-platforms#Enable-DIT-for-constant-time-cryptographic-operations">DIT bit</a> 
								bits, which disable the DMP on some CPUs. 
								Additionally, input blinding can help some cryptographic schemes avoid having attacker-controlled intermediate values, 
								avoiding key-dependent DMP activation. 
								Finally, preventing attackers from measuring DMP activation in the first place, 
								for example by avoiding hardware sharing, can further enhance the security of cryptographic protocols.

            <pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 14:39:24 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://xata.io/blog/introducing-pgzx">https://xata.io/blog/introducing-pgzx</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39779024">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As part of the <a href="https://xata.io/launch-week-unleash-the-elephant">Xata launch week</a>, we are introducing <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgzx">pgzx</a>, an open-source framework for developing PostgreSQL extensions written in Zig. It provides a set of utilities (e.g. error handling, memory allocators, wrappers) as well as a build and development environment to simplify integrating with the Postgres codebase.</p>

<p><a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> is described on its website as a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining <strong>robust</strong>, <strong>optimal</strong> and <strong>reusable</strong> software. Zig is a new language (pre 1.0), but it has been gaining popularity in the systems programming community. It is fair to think of it as a "modern C", providing safer memory management, compilation time code execution (comptime), and a rich standard library. We'll show some of these features in the context of Postgres extensions below.</p>
<p>A major reason to use Zig for Postgres development is its ability to interoperate with C code. Zig supports the C ABI, works with C pointers and data types, including NULL terminated strings, and can even translate C header files into Zig code. Zig's automatic translation of C macros to Zig code is not yet perfect, but it's still helpful. This makes Zig a great choice for working with very large C codebases, like Postgres happens to be.</p>

<p>Because Zig can call any C function and translate C macros to inline Zig functions, you can write Postgres extensions in Zig without any additional tooling by following the same steps you would for a C extension. However, a framework like pgzx simplifies the process significantly by providing a development environment, a set of utilities and wrappers for Postgres APIs, common error handling, and more.</p>

<p>pgzx has at the moment 2 sample extensions that you can take inspiration from. <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgzx/tree/main/examples/char_count_zig">char_count_zig</a> is a minimal extension, while <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgzx/tree/main/examples/pgaudit_zig">pg_audit_zig</a> is more complex and shows more of the features of pgzx.</p>
<p>Let's look at the <code>char_count_zig</code>, which is only slightly more than a "Hello, World!" of Postgres extensions. It adds a function that counts how many times a character appears in a string. This was inspired by <a href="https://www.highgo.ca/2019/10/01/a-guide-to-create-user-defined-extension-modules-to-postgres/">this tutorial</a>, which shows how to do this in plpqsql and C.</p>

<p>Whilst they're similar, the Zig version is actually a bit more concise. This is partially because Zig is more expressive, but also because pgzx does a bit more of the work.</p>
<p>Registered SQL functions receive their arguments serialized and some code is needed to deserialize them. In C you do that with the help of the <code>G_GETARG_*</code> macros, however with pgzx you simply receive them as normal parameters already deserialized. How? By having a <code>comptime</code> function that generates the necessary boilerplate code at compile time. If you are curious, check out the <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgzx/blob/9825dde752ee4ace2cbc594332eba100292aafd5/src/pgzx/fmgr.zig#L77-L102">pgCall</a> function, it's a nice example for the power of Zig's <code>comptime</code> execution.</p>
<p>The <code>PG_MODULE_MAGIC</code> and <code>PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1</code> functions are a second example of <code>comptime</code> usage. They export the required symbols needed for Postgres to recognize this as an extension and to register the function as a SQL function. In this case, <code>comptime</code> acts pretty much like the corresponding C macros.</p>

<p>If you looked carefully at the code above, you might have noticed that it contains a bug. It checks for the <code>target_char</code> to not have more than 1 character, but it doesn't check if it has 0 characters. Later, the code accesses <code>target_char[0]</code>, so if the string is the empty string, there will be a out of bounds access error. We left that bug intentionally in so you can see what happens when bugs like that happen in the extension.</p>
<p>You can trigger the bug with this SQL:</p>
<div role="group"><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>select</span><span> char_count_zig(</span><span>'hi hii'</span><span>, </span><span>''</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Which responds:</p>
<div role="group"><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>server closed the connection unexpectedly</span></span>
<span><span>        This probably means the server terminated abnormally</span></span>
<span><span>        before or while processing the request.</span></span>
<span><span>The connection to the server was lost. Attempting reset: Failed.</span></span>
<span><span></span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In C code, this type of bug could trigger a segmentation fault or even a security vulnerability. If you try this with the <code>char_count_zig</code> extension, the Postgres process still crashes (not the full server, just the process serving the connection), but if you check the logs you'll see an error message like this:</p>
<div role="group"><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>thread 70501513 panic: index out of bounds: index 0, len 0</span></span>

<p>It points exactly where the error happened! This happens because Zig has runtime checks depending on the <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Build-Mode">build mode</a>. The <code>ReleaseSafe</code> mode, for example, trades a bit of performance for more safety checks.</p>
<p>Note that this stacktrace worked so well because the error was in Zig code. When building Postgres extensions, you often have to call Postgres APIs which will still segmentation fault if you use them incorrectly.</p>

<p>Postgres uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region-based_memory_management">allocator arenas</a> to manage memory. In the Postgres source code, the arenas are called <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/utils/mmgr/README">memory contexts</a>. Memory allocated in a "context" can be freed all at once (for example, when a query execution is finished), which simplifies memory management significantly, because you only need to track contexts, not individual allocations. Contexts are also hierarchical, so you can create a context that is a child of another context, and when the parent context is freed, all children are freed as well. This makes memory leaks rather unlikely.</p>
<p>Another advantage of memory contexts is that they improve <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-backend-memory-contexts.html">memory monitoring</a>, because context have names and you can see how much memory is used by each context. This is useful for debugging large memory usage.</p>
<p>This model of using an arena/context allocator happens to match really good with Zig. One reason is Zig's convention to have all functions/objects that allocate memory receive an allocator as a parameter. This makes allocations <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-03-15-zig-rust-and-other-languages.html">more explicit</a> but also makes it easy to use a custom allocator. pgzx defines custom allocators that wrap the Postgres memory contexts and make them available to Zig code.</p>
<p>Here is an example that creates a new context as a child of the current context and gets the allocator for it:</p>
<div role="group"><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>var</span><span> memctx = </span><span>try</span><span> pgzx.mem.</span><span>createAllocSetContext</span><span>(</span><span>"zig_context"</span><span>, .{ .parent = pg.CurrentMemoryContext });</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> allocator = memctx.</span><span>allocator</span><span>();</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>Another Postgres API that you will very likely need to know about in a more complex extension is the error handling. Postgres implements "exceptions" in C via <code>setjmp/longjmp</code> and provides a set of macros to throw and catch them (<a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/include/utils/elog.h#L318">PG_TRY/PG_CATCH</a>).</p>
<p>The issue is that long jumps could bypass the Zig control flow, for example <code>errdefer</code> blocks might not be executed. This means that if your extension calls into Postgres APIs, and those APIs can throw errors, long jumps might skip your <code>defer</code> and <code>errdefer</code> blocks!</p>
<p>Luckily, pgzx is here to help. It provides a set of functions that allow you to catch the Postgres exceptions and convert them into Zig errors. For example:</p>
<div role="group"><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>var</span><span> errctx = pgzx.err.Context.</span><span>init</span><span>();</span></span>
<span><span>defer</span><span> errctx.</span><span>deinit</span><span>();</span></span>
<span><span>if</span><span> (errctx.</span><span>pg_try</span><span>()) {</span></span>
<span><span>    // Call Postgres C functions.</span></span>
<span><span>} </span><span>else</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    return</span><span> errctx.</span><span>errorValue</span><span>();</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>pgzx comes with a <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes">Nix flakes</a> based development environment for developing extensions as well as pgzx itself. It also comes with a project template which you can use to set up this environment in a new repository. To use it, <a href="https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer">install Nix</a> and then run:</p>
<div role="group"><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>mkdir</span><span> my_extension</span></span>
<span><span>cd</span><span> my_extension</span></span>
<span><span>nix</span><span> flake</span><span> init</span><span> -t</span><span> github:xataio/pgzx</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then load the nix shell with:</p>

<p>The dev environment includes commands to relocate the Postgres binaries in your development environment, to start the server, and so on. The template also comes with a minimal extension and a <code>build.zig</code> file with a few common tasks. See the template <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgzx/tree/main/nix/templates/init">README</a> for how to build the extension from this point.</p>

<p>Postgres extensions are typically tested via a tool called <code>pg_regress</code>. This is supported by pgzx as well, simply call <code>zig build pg_regress</code>.</p>
<p>But we also wanted to have unit tests. This is a bit tricky because the tests need to be compiled and run in the <strong>context of a Postgres instance</strong>. Otherwise, they won't be able to interact with Postgres' APIs.</p>
<p>In order to solve this, pgzx registers a custom <code>run_tests</code> function. This function can be called from SQL (<code>SELECT run_tests();</code>) and it will run the unit tests. A test suite is a Zig struct with functions starting with <code>test</code>. To register a test suite, you would typically do something like this:</p>
<div role="group"><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>comptime</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    pgzx.testing.</span><span>registerTests</span><span>(</span><span>@import</span><span>(</span><span>"build_options"</span><span>).testfn, .{Tests});</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgzx/blob/9825dde752ee4ace2cbc594332eba100292aafd5/src/pgzx/testing.zig#L39">registerTests</a> function is another example of <code>comptime</code> usage. It iterates over all the fields of a struct and generates the call to run the tests when the <code>run_tests()</code> function is called in SQL.</p>

<p>This walkthrough covered some of the more interesting functionality exposed by pgzx, but there's more on offer: wrappers for the Postgres data structures (<a href="https://xataio.github.io/pgzx/#A;pgzx:list">lists</a>, hashtables), <a href="https://xataio.github.io/pgzx/#A;pgzx:spi">SPI</a>, <a href="https://xataio.github.io/pgzx/#A;pgzx:shmem">shared memory access</a>, <a href="https://xataio.github.io/pgzx/#A;pgzx:pq">connection management</a>, and more...</p>

<p>At Xata, we have been working on a new Postgres project, which doesn't really have a name yet, so let's call it <em>"Xata's take on distributed Postgres"</em>. It's in its very early stages, however we'll be open sourcing it soon and we're planning to <a href="https://mailchi.mp/xata/2zoy27tx2e">build it in public</a>. It will be somewhat similar to Citus, but some different choices, especially around usage and DX, based on what we learned running Xata for the past couple of years.</p>
<p>For this project, we considered three potential implementation directions:</p>
<ol role="list"><li>As an external proxy, like Vitess does for MySQL.</li><li>As a Postgres extension, like Citus.</li><li>As a fork of Postgres, like Greenplum.</li></ol>
<p>We have some experience with the first option because that's how our current Xata Proxy works, see more details in this <a href="https://xata.io/blog/serverless-postgres-platform">blog post</a>, so we were almost biased towards it. We know we can speak the Postgres wire protocol, parse the incoming queries and understand them at a deep level, as well as create distributed transactions via 2PC. However, we also know that leveraging existing Postgres code it will open up more options and avoid us having to reimplement some very difficult parts. Given the long term vision of the project, and that we didn't want to maintain a fork, we decided to go with the second option.</p>
<p>The next node in our decision tree was the <strong>programming language</strong>. The main options we considered were C, Rust, and Zig. While there are pros and cons to each of these options, which we might cover in detail a future blog post, we decided to go with Zig. The main "pros" for Zig were:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>It allows us to call into the Postgres APIs almost directly, so we have the same power as using C.</li><li>It offers more memory safety than C, it's a bit more expressive, and a bit more fun (we think).</li><li>It fits well with the Postgres codebase, for example when it comes to memory management and string handling.</li></ul>
<p>As we started working, we realized that an equivalent for Rust's <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx">pgrx</a> would be needed for Zig as well, so we started pgzx.</p>
<p>While Zig and pgzx might not be the best choice for every Postgres extension, we think it's a reasonable choice for our project and perhaps for some others as well.</p>

<p>pgzx is new and should be considered "alpha" as of now. However, if you want to build a Postgres extension and you want to use Zig, it's going to be a lot easier with pgzx than without it. A status of the covered functionality is in the <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgzx">README</a>.

<p>Also, if this blog post has sparked your interest in Zig and you want to give it a try, why not develop a Postgres extension? Let us know about it and we'll include it in the list of examples!</p>
