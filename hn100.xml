<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	<p><span><span>A</span></span>s diligent taxpayers breathe a sigh of relief that the hassle of filing their tax forms is over for another year, the Internal Revenue Service continues to let most U.S. hospitals <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/nonprofit-hospitals-tax-breaks-community-benefit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pay nothing</a> in federal taxes. It’s time for Congress to take a hard look at the IRS’s hand in health care.</p>
<p>The agency uses a vague “community benefit” standard to liberally grant tax-exempt status to so-called nonprofit hospitals even as many of them are financially taking advantage of sick Americans with inflated medical bills. Several of my Johns Hopkins colleagues and I <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2737183" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association showing that some nonprofit hospitals sue and garnish the wages of low-income patients who can’t afford to pay their medical bills. Where’s the community benefit in that? Nonprofit hospitals are supposed to be compassionate and merciful, not predatory and ruthless.</p>
<p>Many hospitals force people who are suffering and seeking care in earnest to sign their financial life away as a condition of treatment. Some make <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/30/well/live/surprise-medical-bills.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contesting a bill</a> difficult and others <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4107837-just-over-a-third-of-hospitals-are-complying-with-price-transparency-rules-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do not comply</a> with the federal <a href="https://www.cms.gov/priorities/key-initiatives/hospital-price-transparency/hospitals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hospital transparency rule</a> which requires hospitals to post prices for common shoppable services. The most recent money game that nonprofit hospitals are dialing up is adding billions of dollars in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/hidden-hospital-fees-cost-patients-hundreds-of-dollars-0024cd95" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“facility fees”</a> for routine care. These billing tricks are fleecing everyday Americans. Congress could make them disappear overnight if it passed a law disqualifying hospitals that use them from getting the coveted tax-exempt benefit.</p>
<p>Many tax-exempt hospitals argue that they provide millions of dollars in free care. But here’s what’s really going on: Much of what they call free care is emergency care that hospitals are required to provide by law (the 1986 <a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare/regulations-guidance/legislation/emergency-medical-treatment-labor-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act</a> requires hospitals to care for anyone who walks in with an emergent condition). But after the care has been provided, patients are often hounded for payment, often at an artificially inflated price. Hospitals then report the difference between their high sticker price and what they actually collect after shaking down a patient as charity care.</p>
<p>But that’s not charity. In a twist of irony, a 2021 study <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.01627" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published in Health Affairs</a> found that for-profit hospitals provided 65% <em>more</em> charity care than nonprofit ones.</p>
<p>The bar for receiving tax-exempt status should not be simply abiding by the law.</p>
		
		
<p>Hospitals leaders across the nation have told me that they need to avoid federal taxes in order to survive. But the way taxes work, businesses are taxed only on their profits. Some hospitals hide their profits in cost-shift accounting and loan refinancing, even engaging in aggressive real estate and venture capital investing. According to <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/951644600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public tax records</a>, Cedars Sinai in Beverly Hills had an income surplus of $750 million in 2022 and paid no federal taxes. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York had $400 million and also paid no federal taxes. The top three hospital administrators there made nearly $20 million in salaries.</p>
<p>Try booking an appointment at these or any nonprofit hospital and see if you can do it without insurance or cash up front. It’s nearly impossible. Most nonprofit hospitals will refuse to schedule appointments, even cancer care, unless you financially qualify by showing your ability to pay.</p>
<p>If hospitals schedule appointments and operations only for people who financially qualify, arguing that they are a business, they should pay their fair share of taxes like every other American business. A Kaiser Family Foundation <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/the-estimated-value-of-tax-exemption-for-nonprofit-hospitals-was-about-28-billion-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> estimated the total value of tax exemptions for nonprofit hospitals was $28 billion in 2020 alone. By my calculation, that’s equivalent to a $107 tax credit for every American who filed a return that year.</p>
<p>Momentum to stop this gaming of the system is growing. In August, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Bill Cassidy and Elizabeth Warren <a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-colleagues-probe-potential-abuse-of-tax-exempt-status-by-nonprofit-hospitals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demanded more transparency</a> from the IRS on the issue after a <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-106777.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Accountability Office report</a> found that the agency “did not have a well-documented process” to ensure that hospitals met tax-exempt criteria.</p>
			
		
<p>In October, Bernie Sanders, the chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee stressed the need to address the problem. “Many nonprofit hospital systems across the country are failing to provide low-income Americans with the affordable medical care required by their nonprofit status — despite receiving billions in tax benefits and providing exorbitant compensation packages to their senior executives,” he said in a <a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/chair/newsroom/press/news-chairman-sanders-releases-new-report-showing-major-nonprofit-hospital-systems-exploiting-tax-breaks-and-prioritizing-ceo-pay-over-helping-patients-afford-medical-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a>.</p>
<p>In another sign that government officials are getting fed up with hospitals paying no taxes, in 2023 a Pennsylvania judge revoked a hospital’s property tax exemption. This action came after the Pottstown school district sued the hospital, arguing that its special tax treatment resulted in <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/pa-hospitals-revoked-property-tax-exemption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$900,000 less revenue</a> for the school each year.</p>
<p>It’s not just the IRS’s lackadaisical approach to hospitals that’s mind-boggling. It’s also the agency’s hostility to direct primary care and other creative strategies developed by doctors to address chronic diseases. The IRS does not allow individuals or families who subscribe to direct primary care — a type of intensive primary care that takes extra time to focus on prevention — to include that cost as a tax-deductible health savings account expense. A <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-improving-price-quality-transparency-american-healthcare-put-patients-first/#:~:text=potentially%20including%20direct%20primary%20care%20arrangements%20and%20healthcare%20sharing%20ministries%2C%20as%20eligible%20medical%20expenses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 White House executive order</a> challenged this position to no avail. Last month, the IRS sternly <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-alert-beware-of-companies-misrepresenting-nutrition-wellness-and-general-health-expenses-as-medical-care-for-fsas-hsas-hras-and-msas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a> Americans that they cannot use their own health savings account to buy healthy foods as directed by their doctors.</p>
<p>The IRS continues to propagate a reactionary approach to sickness rather than a proactive approach to health. Chronic diseases are the leading cause of death in the U.S. and consume a majority of the $4.5 trillion Americans <a href="https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/nhe-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spend on health care</a>. The current Whac-a-Mole system isn’t working. Most American adults take <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/prescription-drugs/too-many-meds-americas-love-affair-with-prescription-medication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 or more prescription medications</a> regularly, making the U.S. the most medicated population in the world. The country needs to try <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7023959/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new approaches</a> to health.</p>
<p>Instead of scolding Americans who sign up for direct primary care or want to eat healthier foods, the IRS should hold hospitals accountable for the taxes they should be paying.</p>

	<h2 id="embeddable-game-engine">Embeddable Game Engine</h2>
<p><img src="https://migueldeicaza.github.io/SwiftGodotDocs/images/SwiftGodot%20Header.png" width="240">
Many years ago, when working at Xamarin, where we were building cross-platform
libraries for mobile developers, we wanted to offer both 2D and 3D gaming
capabilities for our users in the form of adding 2D or 3D content to their
mobile applications.</p>
<p>For 2D, we contributed and developed assorted Cocos2D-inspired libraries.</p>
<p>For 3D, the situation was more complex. We funded a few over the years, and we
contributed to others over the years, but nothing panned out (the
history of this is worth a dedicated post).</p>
<p>Around 2013, we looked around, and there were two contenders at the
time, one was an embeddable engine with many cute features but not great UI
support called Urho, and the other one was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine)">Godot</a>, which had a great IDE, but
did not support being embedded.</p>
<p>I reached out to Juan at the time to discuss whether Godot could be turned into
such engine.   While I tend to take copious notes of all my meetings, those
notes sadly were gone as part of the Microsoft acquisition, but from what I can
remember Juan told me, "Godot is not what you are looking for" in two dimensions,
there were no immediate plans to turn it into an embeddable library, and it was
not as advanced as Urho, so he recommended that I go with Urho.</p>
<p>We invested heavily in binding Urho and created
<a href="https://github.com.xamarin/urho">UrhoSharp</a> that would go into becoming a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/bring-3d-models-life-augmented-reality-urhosharp/">great
3D library for our C# users</a> and worked not only on every desktop and mobile
platform, but we did a ton of work to make it great for AR and VR headsets.
Sadly, Microsoft's management left UrhoSharp to die.</p>
<p>Then, the maintainer of Urho stepped down, and Godot became one of the most
popular open-source projects in the world.</p>
<p>Last year, @Faolan-Rad <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72883">contributed a patch to Godot</a> to turn it into a library
that could be embedded into applications.   I used this library to build
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodotKit">SwiftGodotKit</a> and have been
very happy with it ever since - allowing people to embed Godot content into
their application.</p>
<p>However, the patch had severe limitations; it could only ever run one Godot game as
an embedded system and could not do much more.   The folks at <a href="https://www.smirk.gg/">Smirk
Software</a> wanted to take this further. They wanted to host
independent Godot scenes in their app and have more control over those so
they could sprinkle Godot content at their heart's content on their mobile app.</p>
<p>They funded some initial work to do this and hired <a href="https://migeran.com/">Gergely
Kis's company</a> to do this work.</p>
<p>Gergely demoed this work at GodotCon last year.   I came back very excited from
GodotCon and I decided to turn my <a href="https://x.com/migueldeicaza/status/1723765594653167892">prototype Godot on iPad</a> into a <a href="https://blog.la-terminal.net/igodot/">complete
product</a>.</p>
<p>One of the features that I needed was the ability to embed chunks of Godot in
discrete components in my iPad UI, so we worked with Gergely to productize and
polish this patch for general consumption.</p>
<p>Now, there is a <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/90510">complete patch under review</a> to allow people to embed arbitrary
Godot scenes into their apps.   For SwiftUI users, this means that you can embed a Godot scene into a <code>View</code> and display and control it at will.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the team will accept this change into Godot, and once this is done, I will
update SwiftGodotKit to get these new capabilities to Swift users (bindings for
other platforms and languages are left as an exercise to the reader).</p>
<p>It only took a decade after talking to Juan, but I am back firmly in Godot land.</p>

  <p>What I’ll miss most is the sound of his voice, cooked up in the North Carolina mountains out of remnants from across an ocean. <em>There</em> always <em>thar</em>, <em>fire</em> always <em>far</em>. I loved the phrase <em>ever which a’way but loose</em>. Loved how things <em>liked to happen</em>. How <em>hello</em> was <em>what do you say</em> and how <em>being still</em> meant <em>setting awhile</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Even his voice was quiet, throaty and clipped in the way of men in these mountains — a voice meant for conversations beyond a crowd, meant for the group of men eyeing the door, aiming to be outside where it’d be easier to talk about nothing or just as soon not talk at all.&nbsp;</p><p>He could go hours without saying a word, but a flash of wit always waited on his tongue. For nearly 70 years he kept up a constant, good-natured banter with Grandma over anything and everything.&nbsp;</p><p>“I can’t rightly remember,” she said on one of my story-seeking visits.</p><p>“You’re getting too old to remember all that, woman.”</p><p>“I surely am.”</p><p>“I know the feeling.”</p><p>A month before he passed, faded and worn down to a wheelchair, his head still popped up when Grandma walked into the kitchen: “Hey thar, pretty girl.”&nbsp;</p><p>The morning after Grandma called me, I took my boys by to see Papaw for the last time. He’d been unresponsive for a day, but when we entered the bedroom, he was awake again. He couldn’t find his voice — he’d been breathing through his mouth, and his throat was too dry to speak up — so I leaned in. He looked to my sons and said, “Hey, fellers.”</p><p>They waved.&nbsp;</p><p>“I love you,” I told him.</p><p>“Love you, buddy,” he whispered.&nbsp;</p><p>“You done good,” I said because that’s how he would’ve said it, but also because that’s how I meant it. He’d done so much good, even if it couldn’t be listed on official records or captured in the stat sheet of an obituary. The good of his life was ever-rippling water, quiet and steady, and my boys and I would long be swept up in it.&nbsp;</p>

In these places, their version of the truth can proliferate without the moderation they’ve grown to despise. To do this, the conventional strategy is to reskin open-source social media platforms without attribution. There is, of course, a certain irony to the fact that the labor they exploit is frequently performed by liberals, queers, socialists, and other groups they’ve sworn to destroy, but I digress.</p><p>Luckily, the platforms they leech off are not entirely defenseless. The code of Mastodon is released under the AGPL, a strict open source license that prevents redistribution without disclosure of derivative source code.&nbsp; Both gab and Truth Social have been identified as derivative work of Mastodon, and hence both are bound by the provisions of the AGPL. Mastodon has successfully defended its codebase a number of times, including in 2021, when they successfully convinced Truth Social to release its code. Truth Social continued these releases until December 20th, 2022, when the uploads stopped. How embarrassing.</p><p>To conduct a request under the AGPL, I need to prove that Truth Social uses AGPL licensed code, and that I have accessed said code. The latter is incredibly easy — the login page fetches <code>/api/v1/instance</code>, which is a pretty distinct Mastodon characteristic. Still, what’s to say that they didn’t just do a faithful, clean room implementation of the Mastodon API? The login page source code makes zero reference to ‘Mastodon’, so I was playing with this familiar API looking for a tell.</p><p>Yeah, I think I found it.</p><p><img src="https://boehs.org/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240411112921.png"></p><p>With this in mind, I set my sights on the legal department. Somehow, I doubted they would reply to me.</p><p><img src="https://boehs.org/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240411113030.png"></p><p>I also started poking around on the frontend, which is unambiguously powered by Soapbox, another piece of software licensed under the AGPL.</p><p><img src="https://boehs.org/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240411114228.png"></p><p>They also make “open source” releases of Soapbox. I was curious if these releases would be up-to-date (they aren’t), but what I found was really quite interesting:</p><p><img src="https://boehs.org/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240411115229.png"></p><p>Simply uploading your compiled code and calling it “open source” does <em>not</em> count as compliance, even if it was up-to-date.</p><p>At this point, the SFC was taking interest. While I have more than enough grounds for the above request, if they don’t comply, the next challenge before a public exposé is proving that the <em>Mastodon</em> codebase has actually been changed since its last open source release. This, of course, is incredibly plausible, given the frontend code obviously has. But we need proof.</p><p>Kindly, I was provided with a Truth Social account (I do not want my phone number on there, in the event that a little birdie gives maia arson crimew another issue of “<a href="https://maia.crimew.gay/posts/meet-the-shitpoasters/">the shitposters</a>”). I then clicked around, and discovered the following endpoints in a minute:</p><pre><code>/api/v4/truth/ads?device=desktop
/api/v1/truth/policies/pending
/api/v1/truth/carousels/suggestions
/api/v1/truth/policies/pending
/api/v1/groups/tags
</code></pre><p>Unsurprisingly, Mastodon does not have an ads endpoint. It also doesn’t have a v4 API. Neither does the open source release.</p><p>The truth directory does exist. It’s at <code>/app/controllers/api/v1/truth/</code>. Unfortunately for Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, the files are missing here.</p><pre><code>$ tree app/controllers/api/v1/truth
app/controllers/api/v1/truth
├── admin
│ &nbsp; └── accounts_controller.rb
├── emails_controller.rb
├── passwords_controller.rb
└── trending
&nbsp; &nbsp; └── truths_controller.rb
$ rg carousels | wc -l
0
</code></pre><p>Of course, Republicans are categorically inclusive, which is why they bundle code from a <em>third</em> fediverse codebase that’s AGPL licensed — Pleroma:</p><p><img src="https://boehs.org/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240411135059.png"><br>(nice localization, btw).</p><p>I was, of course, expecting this to go nowhere. I’m just Evan. TMTG could just drag their feet with the hopes that I give up. I, of course, had no intent of doing so — I was very serious when I said that I would take this matter to the press if I had to. Surprisingly, however, this story doesn’t end with a public boxing match between me and the 45th president. I decided that I would give them 7 days before escalating. This weekend, I received an email stating that they had complied — 2 days before my internal deadline. I checked the source code and sure enough, it is up-to-date as far as I can tell. I’ve released it here:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/boehs/truthsocial/tree/main">Automatically updated dump of Truth Social’s source code (reskinned Mastodon)</a></p><p>Once again, this was absolutely not the outcome I expected. Some people might be <em>disappointed</em> by it. I might be relieved. After I sent that email, I was a little worried about what I was getting myself into. The <em>Truth Social Legal Team</em>. Imagine. But it went my way. The real takeaway is that you do have power. Don’t be scared of the big guys. Speak their language, play on their court. Stand up for what you believe in. You can win. Finally, I want to thank Truth Social for complying appropriately. While we couldn’t be further apart politically, I respect that they followed the law in a timely manner without a fight.</p><p>In terms of the code — I haven’t looked at it yet. It’s diverged significantly from Mastodon, but the resemblance is there. They’ve cherry-picked specific commits from upstream, but not all of them. I’m sure there are some <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@bontchev/112257849039442072">goodies to be found</a>. I encourage all of you to go looking for them alongside me, as that is your right. Tell me what you find. God speed.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">We technically support building against OpenBLAS as a BLAS provider, but we <strong>strongly discourage it</strong>. The performance offered by OpenBLAS is significantly lower than that of Intel's MKL, regardless of the CPU manufacturer. Furthermore, OpenBLAS enables OpenMP parallelization by default, but unfortunately our matrices are too small to take advantage of OpenMP and we end up with up to 100x slowdown compared MKL in the worst case scenario with the majority of end users not aware of how to debug this issue. How sad.</p>

<p dir="auto">On MacOS, translateLocally doesn't rely on MKL, but instead on Apple accelerate. If you want to build a portable executable that is able to run on multiple machines, we recommend using Qt's distribution of Qt, as opposed to homebrew's due to issues with <a href="https://github.com/XapaJIaMnu/translateLocally/issues/69" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/XapaJIaMnu/translateLocally/issues/69/hovercard">macdeployqt</a>. To produce a <code>.dmg</code>do:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j3 --target translateLocally-bin translateLocally.dmg"><pre>mkdir build
<span>cd</span> build
cmake ..
cmake --build <span>.</span> -j3 --target translateLocally-bin translateLocally.dmg</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, if you wish to sign and notarize the <code>.dmg</code>for distribution, you may use <a href="https://github.com/XapaJIaMnu/translateLocally/blob/master/dist/macdmg.sh">macdmg.sh</a></p>

<p dir="auto">translateLocally supports importing custom models. translateLocally uses the <a href="https://github.com/browsermt/marian-dev">Bergamot</a> fork of <a href="https://github.com/marian-nmt/marian-dev">marian</a>. As such, it supports the vast majority marian models out of the box. You can just train your marian model and place it a directory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Basic model import</h2><a id="user-content-basic-model-import" aria-label="Permalink: Basic model import" href="#basic-model-import"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The directory structure of a translateLocally model looks like this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ tree my-custom-model
my-custom-model/
├── config.intgemm8bitalpha.yml
├── model_info.json
├── model.npz
└── vocab.deen.spm"><pre>$ tree my-custom-model
my-custom-model/
├── config.intgemm8bitalpha.yml
├── model_info.json
├── model.npz
└── vocab.deen.spm</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The <code>config.intgemm8bitalpha.yml</code> name is hardcoded, and so is <code>model_info.json</code>. Everything else could have an arbitrary name. translateLocally will load the model according to the settings specified in <code>config.intgemm8bitalpha.yml</code>. These are just normal marian configuration options. <code>model_info.json</code> contains metadata about the model:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ cat model_info.json 
{
  &quot;modelName&quot;: &quot;German-English tiny&quot;,
  &quot;shortName&quot;: &quot;de-en-tiny&quot;,
  &quot;type&quot;:      &quot;tiny&quot;,
  &quot;src&quot;:       &quot;German&quot;,
  &quot;trg&quot;:       &quot;English&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;:   2.0,
  &quot;API&quot;:       1.0
}"><pre>$ cat model_info.json 
{
  <span><span>"</span>modelName<span>"</span></span>: <span><span>"</span>German-English tiny<span>"</span></span>,
  <span><span>"</span>shortName<span>"</span></span>: <span><span>"</span>de-en-tiny<span>"</span></span>,
  <span><span>"</span>type<span>"</span></span>:      <span><span>"</span>tiny<span>"</span></span>,
  <span><span>"</span>src<span>"</span></span>:       <span><span>"</span>German<span>"</span></span>,

  <span><span>"</span>version<span>"</span></span>:   2.0,
  <span><span>"</span>API<span>"</span></span>:       1.0
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Once the files are in place, tar the model:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ tar -czvf my-custom-model.tar.gz my-custom-model"><pre>$ tar -czvf my-custom-model.tar.gz my-custom-model</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">And you can import it via the GUI: Open translateLocally and go to <strong>Edit -&gt; Translator Settings -&gt; Languages -&gt; Import model</strong> and navigate to the archive you created.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quantising the model</h2><a id="user-content-quantising-the-model" aria-label="Permalink: Quantising the model" href="#quantising-the-model"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The process described above will create a model usable by translateLocally, albeit not a very efficient one. In order to create an efficient model we recommend that you quantise the model to 8-bit integers. You can do that by downloading and compiling the <a href="https://github.com/browsermt/marian-dev">Bergamot</a> fork of marian, and using <code>marian-conv</code> to create the quantised model:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$MARIAN/marian-conv -f input_model.npz -t output_model.bin --gemm-type intgemm8"><pre><span>$MARIAN</span>/marian-conv -f input_model.npz -t output_model.bin --gemm-type intgemm8</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">And then changing your configuration <code>config.intgemm8bitalpha.yml</code> to point to this new model, as well as appending <code>gemm-precision: int8shift</code> to it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Further increasing performance</h2><a id="user-content-further-increasing-performance" aria-label="Permalink: Further increasing performance" href="#further-increasing-performance"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>For best results, we strongly recommend that you use student models.</strong> Instructions on how to create one + scripts can be found <a href="https://github.com/browsermt/students/tree/master/train-student">here</a> and a detailed video tutorial and explanations are available <a href="https://nbogoychev.com/efficient-machine-translation/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Student models are typically at least 8X faster than teacher models such as the transformer-base preset.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can further achive another 30%-40% performance boost if you precompute the quantisation multipliers of the model and you use a lexical shortlist. The process for those is described in details at the Bergamot project's <a href="https://github.com/browsermt/students/tree/master/train-student#5-8-bit-quantization">Github</a>. Remember that you need to use the <a href="https://github.com/browsermt/marian-dev">Bergamot</a> fork of Marian.</p>
<p dir="auto">Example script that converts a marian model to the most efficient 8-bit representation can also be found at Bergamot's <a href="https://github.com/browsermt/students/blob/master/esen/esen.student.tiny11/speed.cpu.intgemm8bitalpha.sh">Github</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">External repositories</h2><a id="user-content-external-repositories" aria-label="Permalink: External repositories" href="#external-repositories"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We support custom repositories. You can add a custom repository from the Settings-&gt;Repositories menu. An example repository file can seen <a href="https://translatelocally.com/models.json" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Currently available repositories:</p>
