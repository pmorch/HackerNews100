<p>In April of this year, the Phylum Research Team revealed the <a href="https://blog.phylum.io/digital-detritus-unintended-consequences-of-open-source-sustainability-platforms/" rel="noopener noreferrer">proliferation of spam packages in npm</a> associated with the Tea protocol, a decentralized initiative that promises to compensate software developers in cryptocurrency for their open-source contributions. Last month, we published our <a href="https://blog.phylum.io/q2-2024-evolution-of-software-supply-chain-security-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer">quarterly research report</a>, which estimated that approximately one out of every four packages published to npm in Q2 were associated with Tea, virtually all of which had no redeeming quality aside from gaming the protocol to inflate a software developer’s contribution artificially. With new research from a fresh perspective, our team can now report that the volume of these packages is likely larger than our initial estimates. Like the island of discarded plastic twice the size of Texas floating in the North Pacific Ocean, npm has accrued an astonishing amount of spam packages over the past six months. Join us as we take a fresh look at the pollution in this open-source ecosystem.</p><p>As detailed in <a href="https://blog.phylum.io/digital-detritus-unintended-consequences-of-open-source-sustainability-platforms/">our previous blog</a>, the Tea protocol perversely incentivizes software developers to exaggerate their contribution to open-source development. Using a modified PageRank called teaRank, software developers are rewarded based on their “Proof of Contribution”. As the early SEO spammers figured out how to game PageRank for their benefit, history repeats itself, and a few software developers have spammed open-source repositories with absurd amounts of worthless packages.</p><p>npm, the largest open-source ecosystem, has suffered the worst from this pollution from various actors. Some of the hallmarks of these spam packages are <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdanattagdaysrh?activeTab=code">gibberish package names</a>, packages named with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/interesting-moccasin-pike?activeTab=code">random combinations of words</a> from a list, implausible <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rusttool080059?activeTab=dependencies">lists of dependent packages</a>, a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-job-selector?activeTab=dependents">dubious number of dependent packages</a>, and in this morass of transitive dependencies, the ubiquitous <code>tea.yaml</code> file that ultimately <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hoadandi-27">identifies the code owner</a>. When Phylum first started investigating this situation in February, we were continually amazed at the sheer volume of packages that could be published, clearly due to automation. So, we turned our attention to trying to understand the full scope of this spam problem.</p><p>For a baseline, at the start of 2024, the total number of packages ingested into Phylum daily from npm was about 1,500 each business day and about half that on the weekends. Starting in February of 2024, Phylum began to notice a steady increase in npm package publications from a few thousand to tens of thousands. The high water mark of this increase occurred on 8 April 2024, with over 48,000 packages published to npm. This explosion of packages led us to our first discovery of the <a href="https://blog.phylum.io/digital-detritus-unintended-consequences-of-open-source-sustainability-platforms/">perverse incentives</a> of the Tea protocol.</p><p>Last month, in preparation for our quarterly report, we took a random sample from all npm packages published in Q2, and we manually triaged 1600 packages. If a package contained markers of Tea protocol abuse, as noted above, we marked it as spam. With these, we found a 95% confidence interval for the estimate of the percentage of spam packages in npm in Q2 between 21.25% and 25.5%, or in other words, over 500,000 spam packages.</p><p>Upon further reflection, we considered that many npm projects have nightly builds or alpha, beta, and canary versions. So, these legitimate packages that enjoy a robust development cycle might dilute the size of the true impact of spam. What if we restricted our search to new packages? Packages that have never been seen before in npm?</p><p>We widened our search in our npm data back to February, when we saw the first Tea protocol spam, and then removed all the packages that had at least one version published prior. This left us over 890,000 new, never-before-seen packages between February 2024 and the present. From this set, we took a random sample of 900 packages and applied the same criteria as before. From this new perspective, our 95% confidence interval for the estimate of Tea protocol spam in new packages over the past six months jumped to between 68.66% and 74.67%, or somewhere between 613,000 and 667,000 packages.</p><p>In other words, among all new packages published to npm in the past six months, about five out of every seven packages are Tea spam.</p><p>Followers of this blog know that most of our content focuses on exposing active malicious attacks against open-source software developers. In the spirit of full disclosure, Phylum has yet to discover evidence that these packages contain or lead to the usual kind of malice that we regularly report. But, as a general observation, this pollution is a kind of malice, and there are several dangerous avenues that this could turn into.</p><p>First, unlike malicious typosquatting campaigns, in which an unsuspecting developer might accidentally install <code>reaxt</code> instead of <code>react</code>, it is not at all likely that a developer would make the same mistake with, for example, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/quasar-fig-0e1t?activeTab=dependencies">quasar-fig-0e1t</a>. However, a package like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3-cover?activeTab=dependencies">web3-cover</a> is more plausible, where the developer would also get the 170 dependents along with the complete transitive dependency tree for each of those.</p><p>Next, because the AI hype train is at full steam, we must point out the obvious. AI models that are trained on these packages will almost certainly skew the outputs in unintended directions. These packages are ultimately garbage, and the mantra of “garbage in, garbage out” holds true.</p><p>Finally, these large-scale spam campaigns hinder the open-source package registry’s ability to reason through the safety of all packages in an ecosystem, despite the fact that no reasonable person would ever endeavor to install one of these spam packages. They raise the noise floor and create an environment in which an adversary could surreptitiously hide actual maliciousness.</p><p>Let’s start by taking a look at the following package, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sournoise" rel="noopener noreferrer">sournoise</a>. The npmjs website lists a single dependency on axios.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-05-at-17.55.22.png" alt="npmjs.org showing axios as a dependency of sournoise" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1152" srcset="https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-05-at-17.55.22.png 600w, https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-05-at-17.55.22.png 1000w, https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/size/w1600/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-05-at-17.55.22.png 1600w, https://blog.phylum.io/content/images/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-05-at-17.55.22.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>npmjs.org showing </span><code spellcheck="false"><span>axios</span></code><span> as a dependency of </span><code spellcheck="false"><span>sournoise</span></code></figcaption></figure><p>There is not a lot happening here. The package does not contain code, and according to npm, the only dependency is on the extremely popular Axios package. Is this package safe to install?</p><p>The <code>package.json</code> tells a different story.</p><figure><pre><code>{
  "name": "sournoise",
  "version": "1.0.1",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;&amp; exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "https://registry.npmjs.org/@putrifransiska/kwonthol36/-/kwonthol36-1.1.4.tgz"
  }
}</code></pre><figcaption><p><code spellcheck="false"><span>package.json</span></code><span> for </span><code spellcheck="false"><span>sournoise</span></code><span> shouting the spurious </span><code spellcheck="false"><span>axios</span></code><span> dependency</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Contrary to what npm states, this package actually depends on one of our aforementioned spam packages. This is a by-product of how npm handles and displays dependencies to users on its website. There is no clear linkage to <code>@putrifransiska/kwonthol36</code>, <code>axios</code> lists <code>sournoise</code> as a dependent.</p><p>To say that you’d never install one of these spam packages is to ignore the complexity of the supply chain: transitive dependencies can pull in packages that the developer neither wants nor expects to receive.</p><p>Open-source software ecosystem pollution is a problem for everyone. The Tea protocol project is <a href="https://tea.xyz/blog/proof-of-contribution" rel="noopener noreferrer">taking steps to remediate this problem.</a> It would be unfair to legitimate participants in the Tea protocol to have their remuneration reduced because others are scamming the system. Also, npm has begun to take down <a href="https://github.com/advisories?query=type%3Amalware+zitterorg" rel="noopener noreferrer">some of these spammers</a>, but the take-down rate does not match the new publication rate. And this problem is not limited to npm alone. For example, <a href="https://packages.ecosyste.ms/api/v1/registries/rubygems.org/maintainers/188987/packages" rel="noopener noreferrer">this user</a> published nearly 1800 spam packages on Rubygems in late February and early March 2024. Phylum is actively researching this area, and we will continue to seek new ways to detect this spam as these actors adapt their tactics.</p>

<div id="c0" data-comment-id="17044133" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36</p>
<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>
<p>We received a certificate problem report that indicated DigiCert might have an issue with our implementation of method 7 – DNS-based validation. We have been investigating the issue and discovered a path that could allow mis-issuance. We are still investigating the root cause and gathering a report on the certificates impacted. We will file a full report of our findings when we have the information.</p>
<p>For background, DigiCert supports multiple DNS-related verification processes:<br>
a)	Adding a random value or request token to a TXT record,<br>
b)	Adding a random value to a CNAME pointed to by _dcv.[domain] or another subdomain starting with a prefix as agreed upon with the subscriber,<br>
c)	Adding a random value or request token to a TXT record of a domain that is followed via CNAME,<br>
d)	Adding the random value with an underscore prefix to the CNAME as the sub domain of an authorization domain name,<br>
e)	Adding the random value to a CAA record, and<br>
f)	Adding the random value to a TXT record of a subdomain that includes a prefixed underscore.</p>
<p>Spot checks performed on each of the methods above showed accurate validation information, but we initiated a thorough code review on July 27th to confirm. This review found a potential issue under (d) on our current system.</p>
<p>The code review found one path where a certificate could issue when the random value was used as the host in a CNAME resource record without first pre-appending an underscore. Our preliminary investigation shows that the code that should have appended an underscore as a prefix to a random value when using the CNAME method was not working properly. The code worked in our original monolithic system but was not implemented properly when we moved to our micro-services systems. In some cases, underscores might not have been appended to random values used for CNAME verification where the random value was used as a sub domain.</p>
<p>We also found that the bug in the code was inadvertently remediated when engineering completed a user-experience enhancement project that collapsed multiple random value generation microservices into a single service. This service began including an underscore prefix before each random value, regardless of which validation method the user chose. This project allows DigiCert to simplify the random value generation process. This also reduced customer support calls related to the manual addition of underscore prefix, fixed a bug in our certificate management platform’s display of validation status, and inadvertently ensured that every CNAME-based verification included an underscore prefix to each random value.</p>
<p>We verified that after the UX modification certificate issuance is not possible without proper CNAME verification and reviewed recent issuance to confirm that certificates are not issuing without including an underscore as part of the random value.</p>
<p>The 24-hour revocation rule applies in this circumstance as the issue impacts domain validation. We are currently investigating the root cause and gathering a list of impacted certificate serial numbers. We will post this information in the full bug report along with a complete list of impacted certificates. The revocation process will begin as soon as we’ve identified the impacted serial numbers. We do not expect to have a delayed revocation in regard to this issue.</p>

We’ve been getting inbound requests from various sources for guidance about this incident.</p>
<p>As you know, DigiCert, as a publicly trusted CA, has to comply with the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements, which are written as a collaboration between CAs and Browsers, including DigiCert.</p>
<p>The Chrome Root Program does not have the authority to grant exceptions to the CA/Browser Forum TLS Baseline Requirements. However, we do recognize other programs include exceptions for delayed revocations in some exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>As detailed in our <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/" rel="nofollow">policy</a>, we evaluate all incidents on a case-by-case basis and work to identify ecosystem-wide risk or potential improvements that can help prevent future incidents. The Chrome Root Program continuously points to the factors significant to our program when evaluating incidents which include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>a demonstration of understanding of the root causes of an incident,</li>
<li>a substantive commitment and timeline to changes that clearly and persuasively address the root cause,</li>
<li>past history by the Chrome Root Program Participant in its incident handling and its follow through on commitments, and,</li>
<li>the severity of the security impact of the incident.</li>
</ul>
<p>When evaluating an incident response, the Chrome Root Program’s primary concern is ensuring that Browsers, other CA Owners, users, and website developers have the necessary information to identify improvements, and that the Chrome Root Program Participant is responsive to addressing identified issues. Outside egregious cases (e.g., abject security failures), we do not make trust decisions on individual incidents, and always consider the wider context.</p>
<p>We note the ongoing <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/-WC72Oa5DTI/m/ri0OF9v7AQAJ?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=footer" rel="nofollow">discussions</a> in community forums that seek to minimize impact for revocation activities, and will be looking for opportunities to strike the right balance between the security of the Web PKI and ecosystem considerations.</p>

</div><div id="c3" data-comment-id="17048468" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>We wanted to update the community on the status of this issue. A full incident report is forthcoming. We have identified 83,267 certs impacting 6,807 subscribers. We are planning to begin revoking within the 24-hour time window. Some of these customers have been able to reissue their certificates. Unfortunately, many other customers operating critical infrastructure, vital telecommunications networks, cloud services, and healthcare industries are not in a position to be revoked without critical service interruptions. While we have deployed automation with several willing customers, the reality is that many large organizations cannot reissue and deploy new certificates everywhere in time. We note that other customers have also initiated legal action against us to block revocation.</p>
<p>We have been working around the clock with customers and remain committed to adhering to the BRs. We are aware of and are participating in the active industry discussion happening about the applicability of revocation timelines given the widespread impact and the relative severity of incidents. Our response to this incident to date reflects our commitment to comply with the BRs.  We also note that browsers have mentioned that delayed revocation might still be acceptable under “exceptional circumstances.” However, given no clear definition of what would constitute an exception circumstance, we are seeking root store feedback as soon as possible, as we are standing ready to begin revocations within the timeline.</p>

<blockquote>

I have heard directly from parties of email-validated certificates being impacted, so there is a high likelihood of an overbroad initial revocation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The confusion is around mixed certificates where one domain was verified using a non-impacted method and another was verified using CNAME without an underscore. The data does overcount but only because some underscores were included in random values. We cannot distinguish between those that that had underscores and those that did not within the OEM system and are therefore revoking all of them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While this is preferable to a partial revocation list, it would explain the high volume of customer outreach at present.

Please consider this internally as you analyze the situation and prepare a report.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The total number of impacted certificates is 83,267. The primary source of confusion is the 24-hour notice that was done by email. We added an in-console message to alert users about the revocation but communicating this information in a short period of time outside of email proved difficult.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you confirm what 'applicable domain validations we have in effect' means, please?<br>
0.4% of all domain validations? 0.4% of all DNS-based? 0.4% of the specific method of DNS validations?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes – DigiCert has one main validation system for high volume issuance (CDNs and Cloud providers specifically) and one for lower volume. The reason for the separation is the amount of control a user wants over their certificate process. 0.4% is the total over just OEM (the lower volume issuing system). We confirmed that the CNAME method in this higher volume issuance system worked correctly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Action with no legal basis, if the customers have agreed to your terms &amp; conditions and subscriber agreements, correct?  How can legal action have merit when clearly stated in your legal documentation and industry guidelines?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs) are designed to be temporary while the facts are figured out. Courts routinely grant these to prevent material harm. TROs are legally binding. We did receive a TRO in connection with this revocation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there are customers attempting to bypass these guidelines through legal means affecting all internet relying parties, they should be named.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will need to work my legal counsel to see if we can name them. I have no idea what’s allowed in these circumstances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Unfortunately, many other customers operating critical infrastructure, vital telecommunications networks, cloud services, and healthcare industries are not in a position to be revoked without critical service interruptions.

<p>This will be coming in the delayed revocation bug.</p>

<p>Yes. I would love for them to jump in on Bugzilla. I think that information would be very beneficial to the community.</p>

<p>That’s long-tail in the timeframe cited in discussions when all certificates can be revoked.  We will not be granting that timeline, but we need to untangle the mass revocation process before we can revoke the certificates that are not exceptional circumstances. We will provide a burn-down on the delayed revocation bug.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Digicert, please note that if there is a delayed revocation happening to file a preliminary incident for that ASAP as the questions regarding this incident and why there’s a delay are going to be different. Also, we’re already seeing questions about the delayed revocation pop up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will be filing a preliminary delayed revocation bug today and are working on a draft.  Our systems were prepared to execute the entire revocation before 24-hour mark.</p>
</div><div id="c10" data-comment-id="17049050" data-ismarkdown="true"><p><a href="https://www.digicert.com/support/certificate-revocation-incident" rel="nofollow">DigiCert's public communication</a> about this incident (which has been quoted in <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/digicert-mass-revoking-tls-certificates-due-to-domain-validation-bug/" rel="nofollow">at least one news report</a>) gets the security impact of the noncompliance completely wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The underscore prefix ensures that the random value cannot collide with an actual domain name that uses the same random value. While the odds of that happening are practically negligible, the validation is still deemed as non-compliant if it does not include the underscore prefix.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Failing to include the underscore is considered a security risk because there is potential for a collision between an actual domain and the subdomain used for verification. Although the chance of a collision is extremely low because the random value has at least 150 bits of entropy, there is still a chance. Because there is a finite chance of collision, revocation is strictly required per CABF rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The actual reason for the underscore is so that services which allow users to create DNS records at subdomains (e.g. dynamic DNS services) can block users from registering subdomains starting with an underscore and be safe from unwanted certificate issuance. It serves the same purpose that <code>/.well-known</code> does for Agreed-Upon Change To Website, and that admin/administrator/webmaster/hostmaster/postmaster do for Constructed Email to Domain Contact.  By using DNS records without underscores, DigiCert has violated a security-critical assumption that these services have made.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, this is truly a security-critical incident</strong>, as there is a real risk (not a negligible 2^-150 risk as implied by DigiCert) that this flaw could have been exploited to get unauthorized certificates. <strong>Revocation of the improperly validated certificates is security-critical.</strong></p>
<p>It's troubling that DigiCert is no longer treating this with the urgency required by the Baseline Requirements.</p>
<p>It's also troubling that DigiCert has disseminated misinformation to the public that minimizes the security impact of the noncompliance.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>DigiCert verified domains using a random value in a CNAME without an underscore prefixed to the random value; the impact is limited to issuers utilizing DigiCert's OEM validation system. Validation paths through CertCentral and CIS, DigiCert’s high volume issuance engine for cloud providers, validated domains correctly and are unaffected.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>83,267 valid certificates were issued based on this method. A list of active impacted certificates is attached as a CSV file to this bug report. We are revoking all certificates in the database listed as using CNAME-based DNS validation that are currently valid and issued before the date of the fix. This likely overcounts the number of certificates without an underscore, but the system controls in OEM did not adequately store information about whether an underscore was present.</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>Executive Summary</p>
<p>DigiCert is continuously deploying changes to its RA system to consolidate and improve workflows. DigiCert deployed a change to its RA system to consolidate domain validation flows to reuse random values across multiple methods. This exposed the fact that one path through the system did not include the underscore when using CNAME verification. The issue was fixed with the consolidation but not found until a third party reported the issue. The root causes were siloing between engineering and compliance, a failure to take CPRs seriously if they did not include serial numbers, and a lack of engineering rigor.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>In 2019, DigiCert started creating a services-oriented architecture to extract all validation from the monolithic code. This plan separated the system into three components made up of different services: a front-end portal for customers (called CertCentral), two domain validation systems (CIS for high issuance and OEM for lower volume issuance), one org validation system, and a CA. CIS and OEM share some but not all services. In 2019, DNS CNAME was added to the services-oriented system. Both the monolithic system and service-oriented system ran in parallel while we measured performance and work flows to ensure 1:1 parity. The monolithic code included a function in the front-end that added an underscore if the customer requested a certificate for CNAME validation. The backend system did not check for the underscore, just the random value, and the underscore was not mandatory for any certificate issued through OEM.</p>
<p>Starting May 3, 2024, engineering initiated a project to consolidate and containerize domain validation to prepare for Multi-Perspective Validation (MPV). The goal was to execute on a directive from leadership made in January to open source our domain validation system for the community to use and deploy as needed to facilitate MPV from different global vantage points. This project also finalized the 2019 project by removing paths through our systems that are rarely used, cleaning up code, and consolidating similar processes. One of these processes consolidated the various method 7 steps to a single path. The last few months have been spent heavily on revising our validation system, which lead to confusion about what changes occurred and how the system worked.  The design goal behind these changes (per engineering) was to support a very large customer request from 2023 that wanted to pull all DNS records at each authorization domain name and check a single random value across CNAME, TXT, or CAA resource records. The following timeline discusses all relevant changes to the random value processing code and relevant to this incident.</p>
<p>All times are UTC</p>
<p>Dec 15, 2023 – Engineering architected a plan to consolidate domain methods into a streamlined process that included reusing the same random values across different methods, including non-DNS based methods as needed. This included a plan for making random value generation work uniformly regardless of method. This plan was part of a larger project and customer-requested project for a cloud provider where we wanted to be able to deploy our validation system easily to different regions. Part of this plan is to consolidate to one random value generation service that works with every validation workflow.</p>
<p>Jan 30, 2024 at 2:24 – Engineering created a plan to consolidate workflows into a single validation flow when random values are used. The project is scheduled for Q1 by leadership.</p>
<p>April 16, 2024 at 21:59 – Engineering makes a change to fix a display issue in CertCentral if a validation is originally requested using one method but later completed with another method.</p>
<p>May 1, 2024 at 21:34 – Engineering discusses how to update the DCV methods to use the same random values across domains if the domains are related. Random values being tied to specific validation types is identified as a blocker.</p>
<p>May 17, 2024 at 16:47 – Random value consolidation work starts with fixes to response codes that are causing issues in the API and UX.</p>
<p>May 18, 2024 – JIRA discussion on how to consolidate the user experience for file auth and DNS methods.</p>
<p>May 21, 2024 at 16:00 – During the weekly staff meeting, the team presents the RA consolidation architecture and plan to consolidate the random value process across methods. Compliance is not involved in the architecture design meetings.</p>
<p>May 29, 2024 at 17:00 – Sprint planning meeting to discuss operational changes required for consolidation.</p>
<p>May 29, 2024 at 23:18 – Modification of DCV checking strategy in preparation for consolidation of random value checking to a single process.</p>
<p>May 30, 2024 – Sprint where random value service change is planned begins.</p>
<p>June 4, 2024 at 16:12 – Globalsign sends a Digicert employee a personal email with a question on CNAME-based verification.</p>
<p>June 6, 2024 at 23:53 – Engineering deployed a change that consolidated random values to a single system that uses an underscore across all systems whether they require one or not. There were 7 processes that used a random value (File auth dynamic, File auth static, CNAME token, CNAME RND, TXT, DNS Token, CAA) processes subject to the plan. Although there is some overlap between CIS and OEM with these methods, each system had partially unique workflows that required consolidation. Random values are tied to the process and cannot be reused across methods. The underscore path was chosen as the consolidation because engineering understood that the random value was required in some cases but not others. There is no engineering documentation on which methods were understood as needing an underscore. Compliance was not consulted about this consolidation. After the deployment, random values can be used across different validation methods but random values without underscores cease functioning in the system. Engineering does not provide notice of change as the change is considered technical debt and non-customer impacting.</p>
<p>June 7, 2024 at 19:16 – I received the Globalsign email as the forwarding (on June 6) was missed due to multiple travel schedules. I investigated and found that certificates without an underscore could not issue. I thought the question was about documentation and requested more information from Globalsign. I spot checked random values in CIS and CC and found them included.</p>
<p>June 10, 2024 at 13:00, Globalsign confirmed that they could not issue, but that validation showed as complete.  I ask engineering to fix the UX bug associated with random values (based on the email from Globalsign). Engineering was not consulted on the Globalsign email nor brought into the investigation.  This is where a mistake was made as I should have investigated further on whether something changed.</p>
<p>June 11, 2024 at 11:24 – Engineering deployed a fix based on the UX request. Engineering also modified the random value format. These modifications were based on the Globalsign email but were not considered a compliance change. Engineering does not provide notice of change as customers are not expected to rely on the format of random values.</p>
<p>June 13, 2024 at 6:44 – Engineering merged code to remove DCV methods (ones that relied on the deprecated random value components) that were redundant and no longer necessary. Compliance was not consulted on this change. Notices are not made about the deprecation per DigiCert standard procedure (as no impact was expected).</p>
<p>June 18, 2024 – Our engineering team fixes another UX bug related to random values where the random value displayed to the customer is not the same as expected in the backend. Engineering fixes but does not provide notice of the change.</p>
<p>July 3, 2024 at 20:43 – Our support team received a certificate problem report from a researcher through <a href="mailto:revoke@digicert.com" rel="nofollow">revoke@digicert.com</a>. The researcher asked whether they needed to revoke their certificates that did not include an underscore as part of the random value. The question was not about CNAME-based verification, just random values in general.</p>
<p>July 4, 2024 at 11:24 - Our support team responded that engineering had made a UX change to show accurate random values in the console and requested serial numbers to investigate further. This support email was not escalated.</p>
<p>July 7, 2024 at 23:56 - The researcher asked for clarification on the random value change. The support team responded with information about the validation process and the underscore change that occurred on June 7.</p>
<p>July 9, 2024 at 23:41 – The researcher asked about our documentation that did not specify that an underscore was required in front of the random value. DigiCert support responded that the change was a trivial change to fix the UX to update the console. Support escalated to industry standards, who informed a browser representative about the questions and asked how to address the issue as we were unaware of an issue and could not get a serial number from the researcher. The standards team met to review the validation process and did not find an issue with respect to DNS records. The review included a demonstration of the CNAME process but showed the random value in the CNAME as retrieved from the base domain, not the authorization domain (e.g., - foo.example.com CNAME {_rnd}.dcv.digicert.com), and from an authorization domain with an underscore prefix (eg – [_rnd].domain.com CNAME dcv.digicert.com). No compliance issues were detected.</p>
<p>July 14, 2024 at 21:28 – The researcher responded to the request for serials stating that certificates on CertCentral are impacted and asked for clarification on what happened. No serial numbers are provided.</p>
<p>July 15, 2024 at 15:01 – Support again requests serial numbers and reiterates that the change was a user experience change that consolidated random values between various methods and internal workflows. </p>
<p>July 15, 2024 at 21:49 - The researcher responded asking for more information on what Digicert investigated but did not provide serial numbers.</p>
<p>July 16, 2024 at 15:40 – Support decides this is an industry standards or compliance question and escalates to me to answer.</p>
<p>July 17, 2024 at 16:33 - I ask questions about what’s going on to clarify exactly what the researcher is finding given the previous investigation and demo provided. Engineering is not consulted on the issue.</p>
<p>July 17, 2024 at 23:20 – The researcher resends a list of questions.</p>
<p>July 18, 2024 at 14:50 – Engineering deploys code to consolidate file auth and DNS methods into single process.</p>
<p>July 18, 2024 at 21:21 – I again tried to clarify the scope of issues as there’s confusion around why the researcher thinks that adding an underscore in front of all random values is a compliance issue. The CNAME aspect of the question is missed as random values are investigated across the methods.</p>
<p>July 18, 2024 at 23:16 - The researcher replied that they were upset that notice of the change was not sent to customers and that they were not getting the answers needed. Note that the researcher is correct that notice was not sent to customers. This is not an issue as notices are not typically sent for changes that are expected to have negligible impact. DigiCert’s CI/CD pipeline deploys changes daily and the review process only sends notices for material changes. The researcher claims the change was to comply with the Baseline Requirements. Spot checks were again performed on domain validation and found that the sampled certificates complied with the Baseline Requirements. Spot checks include verification of CNAME validation, TXT validation, and other types of validation that included random values as it’s still unclear whether CNAME is the issue.  The spot checks were primarily new certificates that had been issued after the consolidation change.</p>
<p>July 20, 2024 at 03:48 - I responded that the change should have been trivial as customers should not care about the contents of a random value and asked for more details. As DigiCert splits method 7 into 6 paths, there was ambiguity about which path might have an issue.</p>
<p>July 22, 2024 at 17:07– The researcher claimed a customer integration was broken (provides a link to the github pull where another third party commented on noticing the change with the addition of the underscore) because of the change made to the random value, citing a change to our onion process. This was not considered an issue because onions are not expected to have underscore characters but could have them at the start. Onions were not considered when evaluating the end-user impact of the change.</p>
<p>July 22, 2024 at 22:00 – I reply that I am unaware of an outage and ask for clarification of the outage so I can investigate. An outage was discovered with onion certs where the length of the random value changed.</p>
<p>July 24, 2024 at 22:42 – The researcher stated that they have serial numbers and this was a test to see if DigiCert would acknowledge that there was an issue with domain validation. DigiCert had not detected a mis-issuance, but we gave the other browsers notice that there was a potential issue and informed them that we were investigating. One browser rep offered to assist with understanding the ask from the researcher.</p>
<p>July 25, 2024 at 18:23 – I introduced the individual to the browser rep on the continuing email thread to help identify the issue.</p>
<p>July 26, 2024 at 09:33 - The browser rep helped establish a list of questions that narrow the scope and describe the issue.</p>
<p>July 27, 2024 at 07:36 – DigiCert began code reviews of DNS methods using random values and their paths through its validation system. This review was done on the code version that existed before the random value consolidation project. Engineering found a possible path on its service system that allowed certificates to issue without an underscore prefix using CNAME validation where the host is the random value. An underscore was required for all other subdomains (i.e., - _dcv.domain.com CNAME [rnd].dcv.digicert.com).  This issue is the method from our preliminary report.</p>
<p>July 28, 2024 at 03:56 – DigiCert engineering reported back the root cause and found that the service-oriented system had several paths through the system for random number generation. One of those (OEM) did not add the underscore. Consolidating the random value generator remediated the issue by ensuring that all paths included an underscore at the start of the random value, even if an underscore was not required.</p>
<p>July 29. 2024 at 02:17– DigiCert filed the preliminary incident report.</p>
<p>July 29, 2024 at 22:36 – DigiCert identified impacted certificates and sends notice about revocation.</p>
<p>July 30, 2024 at 2:10-12:56 – DigiCert informed the root stores on the impact of revocation. Based on the discussion, DigiCert decides these are exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>July 30, 2024 at 19:01– The court granted the TRO prohibiting revocation. <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68995396/alegeus-technologies-llc-v-digicert/" rel="nofollow">https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68995396/alegeus-technologies-llc-v-digicert/</a>.</p>
<p>July 30, 2024 at 23:12 – DigiCert filed a delayed revocation bug.</p>
<h3>Root Cause Analysis</h3>
<p>In August 2019, we began modernizing our domain and organization validation systems towards a service-oriented architecture with a goal of improving performance and simplifying workflows. Legacy code in CertCentral (our TLS certificate management portal) automatically added an underscore prefix to random values if a customer selected CNAME-based verification. Our new architecture redirected all validation through separate services instead of the legacy monolithic code structure. The code adding an underscore prefix was removed from CertCentral and added to some paths in the updated system. The underscore prefix addition was not separated into a distinct service. One path through the updated system did not automatically add the underscore nor check to see if the random value had a pre-appended underscore.</p>
<p>We recently found the omission of an automatic underscore prefix was not caught during the cross-functional team reviews that occurred before deployment of the updated system. While we had regression testing in place, those tests failed to alert us to the change in functionality because the regression tests were scoped to workflows and functionality instead of the content/structure of the random value. Other paths through the system either added underscores automatically or required customers to manually add the random value before verification completed. Unfortunately, no reviews were done to compare the legacy random value implementations with the random value implementations in the new system. Had we conducted those evaluations, we would have learned earlier that the system was not automatically adding the underscore prefix to the random value.</p>
<p>On June 11, 2024, engineering completed a user-experience project that collapsed multiple random value generation microservices into a single service. This service began including an underscore prefix before each random value, regardless of which validation method the user intended to use. This project allows DigiCert to ignore the random value generation process when verifying a domain and only check whether a random value appears in an authorization domain name. This deployment also reduced customer support calls related to the manual addition of underscore characters, fixed a bug in CertCentral’s display of validation status, and inadvertently ensured that every CNAME-based verification included an underscore prefix to each random value. As before, we did not compare this UX change against the underscore flow in the legacy system.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, a researcher contacted our problem report alias over email asking about random values used in validation. Although the reporter did not provide serial numbers for any certificates, DigiCert conducted a preliminary investigation. This initial investigation did not uncover any issues with random value generation or validation. After the reporter requested answers to their repeated questions without providing any certificate serial numbers, DigiCert sought guidance from external CABF participants, who suggested DigiCert conduct an additional review. Upon further review, DigiCert discovered an issue regarding the underscore prefix for random values. DigiCert then initiated this incident management process.</p>
<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>First, we need to have a compliance sign-off process in engineering. Engineering is expected to read and understand the standards. We also have a process for questions from engineering. However, there was not a sign-off process before RA or CA deployments, nor were compliance people included in the planning process.</p>
<p>Second, this would have been better handled if we’d moved the emails immediately from our certificate problem notification process to MDSP. The back and forth wasted valuable time and led to confusion on both the issue and process. The certificate problem reporting process is equipped to best handle reported serial numbers. Anything that is not a serial number needs to leave that queue as quickly as possible and move to MDSP.</p>
<p>Third, this incident and the last one made the fact our teams are badly siloed very apparent. Although we reorganized the compliance team to try and facilitate broader investigations, there is little communication between compliance and engineering. Had engineering sent the change to compliance for review, compliance would have known this was a critical change. Had compliance discussed the issue with engineering, the issue would have been caught in June. Compliance right now is verifying post change instead of pre-change, which is causing serious issues. Amit initiated a project to shift compliance left in the dev process during the last issue and we’ve made significant progress even though additional steps are needed. We will be adding additional remediation actions to this JIRA as we discuss internally how to ensure more technical and thorough compliance reviews that are a partnership with engineering.</p>
<h4>What went well</h4>
<p>We were ready to revoke at the 24-hour mark and could process that number of revocations in about 1.5 hours. The DigiCert team was aligned on the plan to revoke at the 24-hour mark, even if that plan was interrupted by additional information on the impact of the revocation.</p>
<p>We were able to organize on the weekend to investigate the issue.</p>
<p>We deployed code after the last bug that permitted customers to see whether they were impacted by the issue which helped with notification.</p>
<p>We notified browser representatives early.</p>
<h4>What didn't go well</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We were unable to revoke all certificates within the 24-hour timeframe and unable to quickly detangle the customer list of those that had exceptional circumstances vs. those that did not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We never received an actionable certificate problem report. One problematic certificate would have simplified the scope. We rely too heavily on a serial for a certificate problem report and should have treated the allegation more seriously, despite not having any evidence of an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting personal emails is not a good way to kickoff an investigation. Those are easily missed and were not investigated as they did not constitute a certificate problem report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We did not understand the original email about the issue and believed the issue was about the random value generator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We should have moved the discussion to the public earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 24-hour turn-around for certificate problem reports meant our responses were less ideal and didn’t have the research necessary to accurately answer the questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our testing needs to focus as much on compliance checks as it does on customer workflow checks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notices of system changes should always be sent out, regardless of size or complexity but especially if the changes have any relevance to baseline requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The ultimate root cause ended up being me. I have led the compliance team for the past several years. The fact this went unnoticed in our many reviews during that time shows that we need a different approach to both our internal investigations and compliance controls. I also dropped the ball on the certificate problem report by failing to escalate the issue to engineering and give it the proper attention it deserved. Although I did some investigation, I failed to treat the allegations with sufficient seriousness based on what could have been wrong. I assumed I knew the systems and what was happening in them rather than deeply investigating the report. Finally, I didn’t do enough to eliminate the silos between compliance and engineering. We’ve done a lot to rectify those silos, including a complete reorganization in the compliance function. Unfortunately, those changes were too late to rectify the problem.</p>
<p>I apologize to the community and our customers for the events and circumstances that led to this incident. This incident made me realize that I am no longer the person for this role. As such, after consulting with Amit (CEO), we have agreed that the path forward is for me to tender my resignation at the company. I will definitely miss the community, browsers, and public interactions as the PKI ecosystem has been my home and life for such a long time.</p>
<p>Going forward, Amit has asked Tim Hollebeek to lead a task force to implement thorough technical compliance controls (that go above and beyond pkilint) and provide oversight to our engineering team and processes to ensure strict compliance. Tim has 25+ years of computer security experience and was a security architect before joining DigiCert. He is chair of several IETF working groups, has been involved with the CA/B forum for 10 years and is a leader in our industry. I have no doubt that with Tim’s background and Amit’s oversight, he and our other compliance and engineering colleagues will do what’s needed to ensure the rigor the community and our customers expect from DigiCert.</p>
<h4>Where we got lucky</h4>
<p>We patched the system without knowing it. That patch ultimately ended up exposing the issue, which lead to a researcher reporting the problem.</p>
<p>The number of certificates was relatively small compared to the overall scope (2.8% of the non-ACME DNS-based validations through OEM).</p>
<h3>Action Items</h3>
<p>Modify the certificate problem report process to create a Bugzilla discussion for all non-compromised certificate serial numbers. The current process is to wait until an issue is confirmed. Although this will result in more “Invalid” bugs filed, the extra transparency will be valuable. – In progress</p>
<p>Consolidation of random value generators. - Done </p>
<p>Ensure all random values are prefixed with an underscore. – Done</p>
<p>Ensure compliance is part of each architecture review meeting and has the technical expertise to provide solutions. Compliance now has the ability to access architecture meetings but the technical expertise is lacking. – In Progress; eta August 15.</p>
<p>Remove the ability of Product teams to self-identify changes that require a formal compliance review. All changes in the CA and RA systems require a compliance review. Compliance team members will be included in early stakeholder reviews with the RA sprint teams and will determine changes that require formal review. – In Progress; eta August 15.</p>
<p>Add all applicable tests (not just entropy and functionality) for random value content/structure in the context of all validation flows. – In Progress; eta August 15.</p>
<p>Complete review of DCV methods with Industry Standards Development team. – In Progress; eta of August 10th</p>

<p>This is Tim.</p>
<p>We failed to live up to your expectations. Obviously, it is going to take a bit of time for me to get up to speed, but we're going to be doing things differently going forward. We have some amazing people here at DigiCert, and they've done some amazing things, but they don't always work together internally as well as they need to. And since literally the entire planet is relying on them, that's not acceptable and is going to change.</p>
<p>Right now, we're working hard to get all of these certificates replaced as soon as possible, but as you can see from the actions above, we take this very seriously, and have already initiated a variety of efforts to make sure our critical processes are as technically excellent and correct as you deserve them to be.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>-Tim</p>
</div><div id="c19" data-comment-id="17051920" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>Thank you for the incident report. This is quite detailed and really allows the reader to understand the full timeline and how this mistake was introduced. I have two passing thoughts here:</p>
<p>First:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 24-hour turn-around for certificate problem reports meant our responses were less ideal and didn’t have the research necessary to accurately answer the questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From my understanding, it is acceptable to say "We're going to be doing a deep look into this, and we'll update you again in 24 hours." to get more time to do a deeper analysis. I do not think the 24 hour time for CPRs explicitly say that you have to have it full done and complete by 24 hours. Just that you have to have <em>some</em> response by 24 hours, and that response could be a good-faith representation that you're looking further into it.</p>
<p>Maybe the community can correct my understanding here.</p>
<p>Second:</p>
<p>If I'm understanding this correctly, the security impact of this incident could be quite significant if an attacker knew about this flaw. Will there be an action item to go check DCVs since this bug was introduced in production to check for anomalies of DCVs? For example looking at the logs of DNS queries where the domain being queried didn't start with an <code>_</code> and seeing if there are anomalies in any of those issuance patterns?</p>
<p>I'd be interested if the community has any thoughts on how best a search like that can be executed.</p>
</div><div id="c20" data-comment-id="17051989" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>(Speaking personally, not on behalf of my employer.)</p>
<p>Thank you for this detailed and well-written incident report. The timeline is very clear and interesting, and I think the points about siloing between various compliance-critical departments within the same organization are very valuable insights that should be taken to heart by all CAs. The remediation items listed are clear, actionable, and make sense to me.</p>
<p>I believe strongly in <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/" rel="nofollow">blameless postmortem culture</a>. Incidents like this are not the result of individual actions, but of years of systemic failures that have allowed incorrect actions to be taken. I believe this applies at all levels, from newly-hired line engineers to CISOs. Even when leadership changes do need to occur, I believe they should not be precipitated by -- nor announced as part of -- individual incidents. Doing so harms our industry, and sends the wrong message especially to junior employees.</p>
<p>Jeremy, if this resignation is your own idea, done for your own health and well-being, then I hope you know that the rest of this community does not hold you personally responsible or blame you for this incident. We wish you the best. If this resignation is at the prompting of DigiCert leadership, then I hope they recognize that this move reflects poorly upon them.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the report, and I sincerely look forward to reviewing DigiCert's open-source DCV system!</p>

<p>Thank you for saying this Aaron. I have similar feelings and didn’t really know what’s an appropriate way to put it into a comment.</p>
<p>I’d even go as far as saying I would like the CCADB incident response template specifically prohibiting these types of mentions in incident reports.</p>
<p>Personnel changes are not and have never been expected or appreciated as part of an incident response.</p>

<p>One reason: it can set inadvertently make it an expectation for other CAs to think they need to make personnel changes when an incident happens. It has a chilling effect for incident reporting even if that’s not the intention.</p>

<p>Aaron laid out the <em>why</em> in his comment:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the lesson many people learn from shouldering blame, or from seeing blame shouldered, is to hide/bury mistakes instead of learning to uncover ways to make the mistakes easier to spot, earlier, and with more thorough understanding.</p>
<p>And I'd like to echo again Aaron's statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if this is your own idea, done for your own health and well-being, then I hope you know that the rest of this community does not hold you personally responsible or blame you for this incident. We wish you the best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hundreds of other humans helping to run the PKI ecosystem upon which the current Web is built have a lot to learn from these reports; a lot to learn about improving the systems, policies and procedures that keep it going. We will all be digging into the technical details of the report and finding items that can help us improve - but learning to shoulder blame is not constructive in that regard.</p>

<p>Aaron you took every sentiment I was going to say privately and repeated them better than I could. I don't see a single piece of this incident that is a result of an individual failing, but a lack of support in getting them help. Jeremy I know you've made comments in the past that reflect you taking issues personally, but I see that more as you caring about doing your job properly. We need more people across the industry who care, so please reconsider. I see no one externally who thinks you were at all a problem throughout this, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1896053">or in prior incidents</a>.</p>
<p>Back to this incident: At least one organization has reached out regarding a certificate that is a single wildcard SAN that was email-verified but is in the revocation group, so I don't think the mixed-verification scenario explains the full story. Now unfortunately I can't name names, but I was being serious in prior comments. I realize the irony here when one unknown researcher was wasting everyone's time with an actual security incident and not providing serials - but that's where we are. I'd rather there be an overbroad search, but this will be why some subscribers are upset.</p>
<p>With regards to when the clock starts until we get stronger recommendations from CAB/F or Root Programs I am aiming to get CAs to be clearer on their methodology in incident reports. This makes it easier for people to review later, and reach a consensus across incidents.</p>
<p>I strongly appreciate there being an actual realistic time for revocation mentioned at 1.5h, rather than boldly claiming it can be done immediately. I am hesitant on the security of the CNAME underscore method itself, but if it is recognized in the industry then I don't see it relevant to this incident itself. I do think it is leaning too much on overlapping RFCs as a security property, but it is what it is.</p>

<p>I wrote my thoughts about your decision to resign privately, and won’t restate them all here (roughly: oh god, what a blow to the web), but I want to respond to this point.</p>
<p>“Accountability” is not about punishment or scorekeeping or setting an example <em>pour encourager les autres</em>. It is about having appropriate attention paid to the things that caused a problem to occur, by making that reflection and transparency the responsibility of the person who was placed to observe those things and best understand how they happened. That reflection and transparency is <strong>only</strong> valuable to the extent that it changes the future handling of related situations. I know that in your place I would be watching the director’s commentary of <em>Looper</em> over and over to see if I could pull off time travel even <em>just once</em>, but alas that’s not one of the choices available. What matters now is what happens to the web, to DigiCert’s operations, and to Jeremy Rowley as a person and community member.</p>
<p>When DigiCert has another incident (and while I have tremendous faith in Tim, it will happen), I would rather that they have Jeremy Rowley with his wisdom and scar tissue around to guide their response and subsequent improvement. When another CA has a crisis related to domain validation, I want their panicked CISO to be able to reach out to Jeremy Rowley for help, and to see that these crises can be used as powerful tools for change. And, more personally, when DigiCert has rolled out its changes and demonstrated that is exactly the company that we need in such a critical role on the web, I want Jeremy Rowley to get the highest of fives at the after party. DigiCert and its customers and the web already have to pay the cost of this incident, and it would be so much better if we could also benefit maximally from what you’ve learned (so so painfully) along the way.</p>
<p>Of course, I have no right whatsoever to tell you that you can’t resign, Jeremy, or that you “shouldn’t” feel as you do. While I very much share Aaron’s love of blameless postmortem, I know that I can be caustic in these forums when I’m frustrated or disappointed; I hope that hasn’t contributed to you feeling that you should be punished or exiled. If this is your exit, please know that you will be missed.</p>
</div><div id="c27" data-comment-id="17053047" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>I have over 24 years of experience in the DNS (Domain Name System) space. I founded and developed DNS Made Easy in 2002 and have managed DNS Made Easy and Constellix since their inception. Initially, we handled DDNS (Dynamic DNS) entries for millions of hostnames before transitioning to the authoritative DNS space, focusing on the SMB and enterprise market. Over the past 24 years, I have been responsible for serving hundreds of millions of hostnames across millions of domains. For full transparency, DNS Made Easy and Constellix were acquired by DigiCert in May of 2022.</p>
<p>The current DNS-related issue centers on the ability for someone to create a CNAME (Canonical Name) record without being the domain owner. Historically, some services have allowed this due to the challenges of domain ownership at the time.</p>
<p>From a DNS perspective, it is crucial to understand that this issue arises from services that permit third parties to create hostnames within their domain names as a service or value to their customers. This is common among DDNS (dynamic DNS) providers, who typically allow users to map a name to a dynamic IP address, thus enabling the creation of A or AAAA records (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, respectively). Most DDNS providers are not part of this conversation since they do not permit CNAME record creation by third parties.</p>
<p>However, a subset of DDNS providers do allow CNAME record creation for vanity reasons. Although the practice has diminished over the years, it still exists among a few companies. Within this group, the potential problem is further divided into those allowing CNAME records with hostnames starting with an underscore and those that do not. Providers allowing underscores inherently assume the risk of certificate creation for their root domain and are not part of this discussion. This risk can be mitigated with a properly secured domain using specific CAA (Certification Authority Authorization) records, but that is another conversation entirely.</p>
<p>Additionally, many providers do not allow the creation of CNAME records with hostnames of at least 32 characters, which further narrows the potentially affected group. After thoroughly investigating and testing notable DDNS services, it appears that No-IP allows CNAME record creation. While free accounts on their platform are limited to 19 characters, paid users can create longer CNAME records that would have allowed the 32 characters necessary for the CNAME validation.</p>
<p>Following discussions with the No-IP executive team and conducting an internal search, we were able to determine that none of these domains were affected by having a root certificate or a wildcard certificate created. Therefore, I can confidently say that none of the potentially affected domains were impacted. Based on a DNS-level understanding of this situation, no certificates were wrongfully or maliciously created.</p>
<p>Please note that all DDNS providers that allow the creation of A, AAAA, or CNAME records automatically permit certificates for individual hostnames since you can create certificates for them at any time. With any DDNS (or CNAME) provider, you have always been able to perform an "HTTP-01 challenge" to request a certificate for your individual hostname. The issue was whether you could create a certificate for other host names in the domain.</p>
<p>This overview is presented purely from a DNS perspective. I am not implying that the security policies of the appropriate agencies should not be followed. My goal is to assess the likelihood of such an occurrence and cross-reference this with known domains, finding zero collisions. From a DNS standpoint, I believe there is virtually a 0% chance that a domain certificate was wrongfully created.</p>
</div><div id="c28"><div id="ct-28" data-comment-id="17053081" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>First off, my peers at Sectigo and I want to echo others in applauding Jeremy for his contribution to this community and the WebPKI.  Thank you for being an esteemed colleague and a friend.</p>
<p>Now, on to this TRO.  I see that the TRO was filed on July 30, 2024.  As of posting time it’s August 2.  I can’t find any motion to dissolve on Pacer.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1</strong>:  Did you file a motion to dissolve?  Can you post it here?</p>
<p>The BRs require</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An acknowledgment and acceptance that the CA is entitled to revoke the certificate immediately if the Applicant were to violate the terms of the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use or if revocation is required by the CA’s CP, CPS, or these Baseline Requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Question 2</strong>:  Can you share the specific wording in your agreement with Alegeus that meets or was intended to meet this requirement?  This may be illuminating in understanding how to protect CAs from this kind of offense in the future.</p>
</div><div><p>Flags: needinfo?(tim.hollebeek)</p></div></div><div id="c29"><div id="ct-29" data-comment-id="17053732" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>On Saturday, August 3, 2024, 20:47 UTC, DigiCert completed the revocation of the 83,267 certificates affected by this bug, without exception. This was a large, coordinated effort across many organizations to get all certificates revoked within 5 days.  We’re very thankful to everyone for working with us on such a short timescale to make sure all impacted certificates could be revoked while minimizing impact to critical infrastructure and services. Faced with incidents of similar scale, many other CAs have simply let the affected certificates expire naturally. We originally planned to revoke all of these certificates within 24 hours, but a few legal and critical infrastructure related concerns, as well as the scale of the number of organizations we were dealing with, caused us to take a few more days to get everything resolved and revoked safely. Those concerns have now all been dealt with.</p>
<p>Obviously, the best outcome would have been for the validation method to have been implemented correctly, so improving the rigor of our approval processes and continuing to tighten up our technical controls is where we will be concentrating most of our efforts going forward. It’s unfortunate that this bug was exposed as a side-effect of us simplifying and coalescing our validation systems; we intend to provide more details going forward about our new, simpler validation architecture, and we even intend to open-source it so that we can benefit from community examination of the implementations.</p>
<p>We’ve had our DNS experts looking closely at whether any certificates were improperly issued due to this bug and have found no evidence that any of these certificates were issued to anyone other than the intended recipients. We’ve examined the list of affected domains and compared them to the theoretical attacks that have been suggested and found in most cases the suggested actions cannot be carried out successfully, and there’s no evidence anyone even attempted to do so. If people have additional scenarios or evidence that needs to be investigated, we can do so.</p>
<p>Questions have also been asked about whether any S/MIME certificates are affected by this validation bug, since the S/MIME Baseline Requirements include the TLS Baseline Requirement validation methods by reference, and Mozilla Policy has long required domain validation prior to the issuance of S/MIME certificates. We have investigated and found 1,308 S/MIME certificates which were based on flawed validations using this same method, and we will be revoking those as well. A list of affected serial numbers is attached.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A couple of weeks ago I received something I’ve been eagerly expecting from a <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/pocket-reform" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/pocket-reform">Crowd Supply crowd funding campaign</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://mntre.com/about.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://mntre.com/about.html">MNT</a> have been making devices that aim to be “open source, accessible and modular” for a number of years. I didn’t get their original Reform laptop, but I’ve seen those around at events like FOSDEM and I’ve been following the team’s progress with interest. When the Pocket Reform was announced I was immediately intrigued – a smaller form factor, 7 inch full Linux system with open hardware that is easily portable.</p>







<p>I went for the Hyper edition, which came with a beautiful Piñatex sleeve, SSD, and printed manual. Purple, of course, because I want to be <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/branding" data-type="link" data-id="https://joinmastodon.org/branding">on brand</a> 🤓 and, also because I love it!</p>



<p>I posted a very brief <a href="https://makertube.net/w/fmCffr2EwC3kDE9fS4RycA" data-type="link" data-id="https://makertube.net/w/fmCffr2EwC3kDE9fS4RycA">unboxing video</a>. I’ve now had a couple of weeks to occasionally tinker, and I’ve been putting off writing about it all in part because there’s a lot of things to dig into! </p>



<p>One of the things I like, surprisingly, is the chunkiness of the machine. It is really well constructed, solid, and feels great. Fits in a small cross-body bag or satchel. It’s less than half the size of a 14 inch MacBook Pro – you can more than fit two of them side by side on top of the Mac – but it is about 3 times thicker – and that’s OK, because, it is in service of making the innards very accessible and user serviceable. It comes with a complete manual and schematic, which is something I’ve not had in a computer since the 8-bit machines of my youth! The top half contains the mainboard and display (all the ports are in the top half), and the bottom contains the battery cells and mechanical keyboard.

<p>The keyboard is ortholinear, which means it is a direct grid layout rather than offset row-by-row. It’s the first time I’ve used this format, which – along with the smaller keycaps – has made it a little challenging to learn, but I’m doing pretty well now. The trackball is nice and responsive. The backlit keys are easy to adjust.</p>

<p>The screen is excellent – bright, and sharp. Actually I think the screen is probably the aspect that has impressed me most so far.</p>



<p>In terms of ports and connectivity – I’ve yet to hook up to an additional screen via the micro-HDMI connector, but I’ve used the USB-C connections (one of which is used to charge / power the machine), and the micro SD slot. The industrial iX connector for ethernet is likely a good choice for the target niche, and certainly does give more space on the motherboard than an RJ45 socket would… but I’ve yet to put my hands on a passive adapter to enable me to plug in to a wired connection, so it’s currently not as useful to me.</p>



<p>There’s a lot more to talk about, primarily (but not exclusively) on the software side, and also around hardware enablement. Out-of-the-box the Pocket Reform runs Debian unstable from MMC, with some customisations to provide a nice getting started wizard. It is important to point out that this is a machine for hackers and tinkerers – although it works very nicely, it’s not all fully baked in places – for example, the firmware for the system controller (a Raspberry Pi RP2040 chip) is being tweaked and tested, and I’ve already tested one update to that which improved the charging behaviour. </p>



<p>The other day <a href="https://andypiper.co.uk/2024/08/03/messing-with-a-messy-nvme/" data-type="post" data-id="4615">I posted about some issues with an NVMe SSD</a> – that, unfortunately, was on this machine. I actually think there was a physical hardware issue with the drive, as I’ve now replaced it with a higher-performance NVMe and things are moving along nicely (while the problematic SSD continues to report errors when accessed in an adapter over USB). I also managed to temporarily brick the machine by corrupting the uboot in flash, and needed to rig it up with Dupont wires on headers and access the machine from another via USB to get back to where I wanted to be. Very Open Source! 😎 but, I’m comfortable with this, and knew what I was purchasing. The forums and IRC have proven to be useful so far and I’m enjoying learning as well as hopefully (!?) helping the MNT team via my feedback and bug reports. I have a huge amount of respect for what they have built, their ethos, and their commitment to making this as open hardware as they can.</p>



<p>I should be receiving a modem / WWAN card for the second internal expansion slot shortly. I’ve been both learning the Sway desktop environment and also working out how best to organise my setup, so there will be more to cover in future. I particularly want to play more with the onboard I2C, and other hardware opportunities, as well – for example, potentially swapping in a Raspberry Pi CM4 if that <a href="https://mntre.com/modularity.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://mntre.com/modularity.html">becomes a modular option in the future</a>.</p>

<p>Doesn't CrowdStrike have more important things to do right now than try to take down a parody site?</p>
<p>That's what IT consultant David Senk wondered when CrowdStrike sent a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)&nbsp;takedown notice targeting his <a href="https://clownstrike.lol/">parody site ClownStrike</a>.</p>
<p>Senk created ClownStrike in the aftermath of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/major-outages-at-crowdstrike-microsoft-leave-the-world-with-bsods-and-confusion/">largest IT outage</a> the world has ever seen—which CrowdStrike blamed on a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/crowdstrike-blames-testing-bugs-for-security-update-that-took-down-8-5m-windows-pcs/">buggy security update</a> that shut down systems and incited prolonged chaos in airports, hospitals, and businesses worldwide.</p>
<p>Although Senk wasn't personally impacted by the outage, he told Ars he is "a proponent of decentralization." He seized the opportunity to mock "CrowdStrike's ability to cause literal billions of dollars of damage" because he viewed this as "collateral from the incredible amount of 'centralization' in the tech industry."</p>
<p>Setting up the parody site at clownstrike.lol on July 24, Senk's site design is simple. It shows the CrowdStrike logo fading into a cartoon clown, with circus music blasting throughout the transition. For the first 48 hours of its existence, the site used an unaltered version of CrowdStrike's Falcon logo, which is used for its cybersecurity platform, but Senk later added a rainbow propeller hat to the falcon's head.</p>
<p>"I put the site up initially just to be silly," Senk told Ars, noting that he's a bit "old-school" and has "always loved parody sites" (like <a href="http://toastytech.com/evil/index.html">this one</a>).</p>
<p>It was all fun and games, but on July 31, Senk received a DMCA notice from Cloudflare's trust and safety team, which was then hosting the parody site. The notice informed Senk that CSC Digital Brand Services' global anti-fraud team, on behalf of CrowdStrike, was requesting the immediate removal of the CrowdStrike logo from the parody site, or else Senk risked Cloudflare taking down the whole site.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Senk immediately felt the takedown was bogus. His site was obviously parody, which he felt should have made his use of the CrowdStrike logos—altered or not—fair use. He immediately responded to Cloudflare to contest the notice, but Cloudflare did not respond to or even acknowledge receipt of his counter notice. Instead, Cloudflare sent a second email warning Senk of the alleged infringement, but once again, Cloudflare failed to respond to his counter notice.</p>
<p>This left Senk little choice but to relocate his parody site to "somewhere less-susceptible to DMCA takedown requests," Senk told Ars, which ended up being a Hetzner server in Finland.</p>
<p>Currently on the ClownStrike site, when you click a CSC logo altered with a clown wig, you can find Senk <a href="https://clownstrike.lol/crowdmad/">venting</a> about "corporate cyberbullies" taking down "content that they disagree with" and calling Cloudflare's counter notice system "hilariously ineffective."</p>
<p>"The DMCA requires service providers to 'act expeditiously to remove or disable access to the infringing material,' yet it gives those same 'service providers' 14 days to restore access in the event of a counternotice!" Senk complained. "The DMCA, like much American legislation, is heavily biased towards corporations instead of the actual living, breathing citizens of the country."</p>
<p>Reached for comment, CrowdStrike declined to comment on ClownStrike's takedown directly. But it seems like the takedown notice probably never should have been sent to Senk. His parody site likely got swept up in CrowdStrike's anti-fraud efforts to stop bad actors attempting to take advantage of the global IT outage by deceptively using CrowdStrike's logo on malicious sites.</p>
<p>“As part of our proactive fraud management activities, CrowdStrike’s anti-fraud partners have issued more than 500 takedown notices in the last two weeks to help prevent bad actors from exploiting current events," CrowdStrike's statement said. "These actions are taken to help protect customers and the industry from phishing sites and malicious activity. While parody sites are not the intended target of these efforts, it’s possible for such sites to be inadvertently impacted. We will review the process and, where appropriate, evolve ongoing anti-fraud activities.”</p>

The products are intended to drive storage forward in the data center, client, automotive, and consumer segments. Three particular announcements caught our eye: a BiCS8 flash 128TB high-capacity QLC enterprise SSD (eSSD), new SD cards in 8TB capacities, and a 16TB external SSD for consumers.</p><p>

Looking at the 128TB eSSD first, this very high capacity drive will be demonstrated at FMS 2024, presumably at WD's Booth 607 at the Santa Clara venue. As you'd expect in the current data center climate, this device is marketed as being of great benefit for the data demands of AI, ML, and LLMs. WD says that the new 128TB drive uses its eighth gen BiCS8 NAND and that its capacity relies on the use of QLC (four bits per cell) technology. According to WD, the new 128TB SSD is particularly useful for handling &nbsp;"fast AI data lakes and capacity-intensive performance applications."</p><p>

Other data center storage innovations that will be highlighted by WD at FMS 2024 include "the world’s first 32TB ePMR SMR HDD" for massive data storage at scale, as well as a new 64TB eSSD for storage-intensive applications. Furthermore, a new RapidFlex interposer, which converts PCIe SSD signals to Ethernet, will be on show and demonstrated in the OpenFlex Data24 4200 NVMe-oF storage platform.</p></div><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zEhcsBtxvFj4rYXYBkeG5R-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zEhcsBtxvFj4rYXYBkeG5R-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zEhcsBtxvFj4rYXYBkeG5R-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zEhcsBtxvFj4rYXYBkeG5R-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zEhcsBtxvFj4rYXYBkeG5R-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zEhcsBtxvFj4rYXYBkeG5R-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zEhcsBtxvFj4rYXYBkeG5R-320-80.jpg" alt="WD presentation" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zEhcsBtxvFj4rYXYBkeG5R-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zEhcsBtxvFj4rYXYBkeG5R-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zEhcsBtxvFj4rYXYBkeG5R-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zEhcsBtxvFj4rYXYBkeG5R-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zEhcsBtxvFj4rYXYBkeG5R-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zEhcsBtxvFj4rYXYBkeG5R-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zEhcsBtxvFj4rYXYBkeG5R.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zEhcsBtxvFj4rYXYBkeG5R.jpg"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WD)</span></figcaption></figure><div><p>Moving on to consumer/client news, WD says there will be a variety of demos using BiCS8 performance and mainstream PCIe 5.0 NVMe SSDs. FMS 2024 attendees can see these demos involving &nbsp;AI PCs, gaming rigs, workstations, laptops, and more. Western Digital makes some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ssds,3891.html#section-fastest-best-ssds-2024" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ssds,3891.html#section-fastest-best-ssds-2024">best SSDs</a> available, so we'll be looking at related announcements carefully. So far, there weren't any specific models mentioned for the popular M.2 2280 form factor, but we'll have to see what's at the show.</p><p>

WD's flash memory developments are behind some big steps in single-device storage capacities for consumers. The firm boasts that it will introduce the "world’s first SanDisk 8TB SDUC UHS-I card." Also at the show, a new SanDisk 4TB microSDUC UHS-I card is set to debut. These should find appeal among ardent smartphone, drone, and camera users who would appreciate higher-capacity removable storage.</p><p>

Last but not least, WD will demo its super-sized portable SSDs including capacities of up to 16TB for the first time. For now, the 16TB SanDisk Desk Drive is described as a proof of concept, but WD must be trying to commercialize such devices to benefit from hitting the market ahead of rivals.</p></div><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-UNdW8fzbLqaxCeimmTy3Hk"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div>

(<i>Hard to read without using the Jordan Belfort voice in your head</i>&nbsp;😂 ) </p><p> Next, we get straight to the point of why you’re calling. </p><p> Like most sales scripts, it features a pattern interrupt. In this case, it’s “<i>I know you’re busy, I’ll get straight to the point</i>”. </p><p> A pattern interrupt changes someone’s natural pattern of thought. It’s important in every sales script because it gets the prospect to pay attention and let down their guard. </p><p><b>Ex</b>: “<i>Hey John, I know you don’t know me and weren’t expecting my call</i>”. </p><p> Next, it gives us two paths for the two possible responses. </p><p> The “<b>yes</b>” response is pretty standard, but the first “<b>no</b>” response is most important. This is the opportunity to educate the prospect in the way you want. </p><p> The final line is your classic call to action. For many sales reps, this will be your request to get the prospect on another call. </p><p> Although this script asks to send the prospect more information, your goal should always be to get something on the calendar. </p><p> In most cases, <b>sending info via email</b> = <b>never hearing from them again</b>. </p><p> And at last, we have the secret weapon: “<i><b>Fair enough</b></i><b>?</b>”. </p><p> This is one of the most powerful words in selling. </p><p> Chris Voss (<i>hostage negotiator</i>) has said “<i><b>fair</b></i>” is the “<i>single most powerful word in any negotiation</i>”. </p><p> It worked in sales back then and still works in sales today. </p><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/952782d0-49a8-4b20-8e0b-6469edbe1958/Stratton_Oakmont_script_2.png"></p><p> Stratton trained their reps to qualify prospects as early as possible. </p><p> One of the biggest mistakes you can make is spending too much time with an unqualified prospect. Find out your prospect has no chance of buying now, rather than later. </p><p> Next, we have the <b>objection handling</b>. Responses to objections are one of the most important features of your script. Without them, <b>sales reps will fail</b>. </p><p> The goal is simply to get the prospect to say the word “<b>yes</b>”. </p><p> You can also add probing questions like, “<i>I’m assuming you’re already satisfied with their results, am I right</i>?” or “<i>We have clients who used your same brokers, but after they saw our historical returns they change their strategy.

<h2>Tracking supermarket prices with playwright<br>
  <small>Aug  6, 2024 • 2126 words • 11 min read </small>
</h2>

<p>Back in Dec 2022, when inflation was running high, I built a
<a href="https://pricewatcher.gr/en">website</a> for tracking price changes in the three largest
supermarkets of my home country, Greece.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.sakisv.net/2024-08-pricewatcher-1.png">
    <img src="https://www.sakisv.net/2024-08-pricewatcher-1.png" alt="Screenshot of pricewatcher.gr showing a summary of the last 30 days of price changes across 3 supermarkets">
</a>
</p>

<p>In the process I ran into a few interesting hurdles that I had to clear before being able
to "go live". There were also several lessons I learned and faulty assumptions that I
made.</p>
<p>In this post I will talk about scraping: What I use, where it runs, how I got around some
restrictions and how I got it to the point that it can run for months without
intervention.</p>

<h2 id="scraping-js-sites">Scraping js sites</h2>
<p>The main problem was, what else? Javascript.</p>
<p>All three eshops are rendered with js and even in the few spots where they don't, they
still rely on js to load products as you scroll, similar to infinite scrolling in social
media. This means that using plain simple <code>curl</code> or <code>requests.get()</code> was out of the
question; I needed something that could run js.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a>.</p>
<p>Playwright allows you to programmatically control a web browser, providing an API to
handle almost everything, from opening a new tab and navigating to a URL, to inspecting
the DOM, retrieving element details, and intercepting and inspecting requests.</p>
<p>It also supports Chromium, Safari and Firefox browsers and you can use it with <a href="https://playwright.dev/docs/intro">Node</a>, <a href="https://playwright.dev/java/docs/intro">Java</a>,
<a href="https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/intro">.NET</a> and, most importantly, <a href="https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro">Python</a>.</p>
<p>With this in my belt, doing the scrolling and the loading of the products looked like
this:</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>By the end of this method, I have a list of product <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s, each containing the
product's name, price, photo, link, etc, that I get to parse to extract this information.
Then I do the same for the next product category, and so on.</p>
<p>Once I wrote the scrapers for all 3 supermarkets, the next step was to run it in an
automated way, so that every day I will have the new prices and I can compare with the day
before.</p>
<h2 id="automating">Automating</h2>
<p>Running this whole process for an entire supermarket on my M1 MBP would take anywhere from
50m to 2h 30m, depending on the supermarket. I could also run all 3 scrapers in
parallel with no noticeable difference.</p>
<p>However using my laptop was good for development and testing, but I needed a more
permanent solution.</p>
<h3 id="use-an-old-laptop">Use an old laptop?</h3>
<p>The first attempt to a solution came in the form of an old laptop, dating all the way back
to 2013.</p>
<p>It had dual core M-family processor clocked @ 2.20GHz and 4GB of RAM, which are on the low side
especially by today's standards, but then again I only needed to open a single tab in a
headless browser and navigate to a bunch of different URLs. Surely a dual core CPU with
4GB of RAM could handle that, right?</p>
<p>Well, not quite.</p>
<p>Even after bumping its memory to 12GB, the performance was far too disappointing,
measuring in more than 2h even for the "fast" supermarket.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="use-the-cloud">Use the cloud?</h3>
<p>So the next option was to use the cloud ☁️</p>
<p>My first thought was to use AWS, since that's what I'm most familiar with, but looking at
the prices for a moderately-powerful EC2 instance (i.e. 4 cores and 8GB of RAM) it was
going to cost much more than I was comfortable to spend for a side project.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, a <code>c5a.xlarge</code> instance is at <a href="https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/c5a.xlarge?region=eu-north-1&amp;os=linux&amp;cost_duration=hourly&amp;reserved_term=Standard.noUpfront">$0.1640 per hour</a> in
<code>eu-north-1</code>. That comes to a nice $118.08 per month, or $1,416.96 per year. Not so cheap.</p>
<p>So I turned to <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>.</p>
<p>The equivalent server there is <code>cpx31</code>, which is at $17.22 (€15.72) per month, or $206.64
per year, which is ~7 times cheaper than AWS, which makes it a no-brainer for my use case.</p>
<p>So Hetzner it is.</p>
<h3 id="use-an-old-laptop-and-the-cloud">Use an old laptop AND the cloud!</h3>
<p>Having settled on the cloud provider to run the scraping from, next step was to finally
automate it and run it once per day.</p>
<p>The old laptop may not be powerful enough to run the scraping itself, but it was more than
capable of running a CI server that just delegates scraping to the much beefier server
from Hetzner.</p>
<p>My CI of choice is <a href="https://concourse-ci.org/">Concourse</a> which describes itself as "a continuous
thing-doer". While it has a bit of a learning curve, I appreciate its declarative model
for the pipelines and how it versions every single input to ensure reproducible builds as
much as it can.</p>
<p>Here's what the scraping pipeline looks like:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.sakisv.net/2024-08-pricewatcher-scrape-pipeline.png">
    <img src="https://www.sakisv.net/2024-08-pricewatcher-scrape-pipeline.png" alt="screenshot of pricewatcher scraping pipeline in concourse">
</a>
<small>The scraping pipeline in concourse</small>
</p>

<p>It has a nightly trigger which creates the scraping server and then triggers the three
scraping jobs in parallel. When all of them are finished, it tears down the server to keep
the costs down, and the raw output of each scraper is passed onto a job that transforms it
to a format which is then loaded into <a href="https://pricewatcher.gr/en">pricewatcher.gr</a>. Last,
but definitely not least, when any of these steps fails I get an email alert.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-ip-restrictions">Avoiding IP restrictions</h2>
<p>But of course nothing is ever that simple.</p>
<p>While the supermarket that I was using to test things every step of the way worked fine,
one of them didn't. The reason? It was behind Akamai and they had enabled a firewall rule
which was blocking requests originating from non-residential IP addresses.</p>
<p>I had to find a way to do a "reverse vpn"<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> kind of thing, so that the requests would
appear to originate from my home IP.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://tailscale.com/">tailscale</a>.</p>
<p>Tailscale allows you to put your devices on the same network even if, in
reality, they are all over the place.</p>
<p>Once they are in the same network, then you can designate one of them to act as an "exit
node". You can then tell the other devices to use the designated exit node and, from that
point on, all their requests flow through there.</p>
<p>And if you're lucky like me, your ISP is using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT">CGNAT</a>, which basically means that
your public IP address is not tied to you specifically, but it is shared with other
customers of the ISP. This allows some flexibility and peace of mind that your IP won't be
blindly blocked because that wouldn't affect just you.</p>
<p>So after all that, my good ol' laptop just got one more duty for itself:</p>
<p>Acting as an exit node for the scraping traffic.</p>
<h2 id="how-and-when-does-it-fail">How and when does it fail?</h2>
<p>I've been running this setup for a year and a half now, and it has proved to be quite
reliable.</p>
<p>Of course, as with any scraping project, you're always at the mercy of the developers of the website
you're scraping, and <a href="https://pricewatcher.gr/en">pricewatcher</a> is no exception.</p>
<p>There are 2 kinds of failures that I've faced: breaking changes and non-breaking changes.</p>
<p>The first one is easy: They changed something and your scraper failed. It may be something
simple as running a survey so you have to click one more button, or something more complex
where they completely change the layout and you have to make a larger refactor of your
scraper.</p>
<p>The second kind is nastier.</p>
<p>They change things in a way that doesn't make your scraper fail. Instead the scraping
continues as before, visiting all the links and scraping all the products. However the way
they write the prices has changed and now a bag of chips doesn't cost €1.99 but €199,
because they now use <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> to separate the decimal part:</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.sakisv.net/2024-08-pricewatcher-ruffles.png" alt="screenshot of a ruffles chips bag">
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://www.sakisv.net/2024-08-pricewatcher-ruffles-sup.png" alt="screenshot of the html showing <sup>
tag being used">
</p>

<p>To catch these changes I rely on my transformation step being as strict as possible with
its inputs.</p>
<p>In both cases however, the crucial part is to get feedback as soon as possible. Because
this runs daily, it gives me some flexibility to look at it when I have time. It can also
be a source of anxiety in case something breaks when I'm off for 2 weeks for holidays.
(Luckily they don't change their sites that often and that dramatically)</p>
<h2 id="optimising">Optimising</h2>
<p>While the overall architecture has remained pretty much the same since day 1,
I've made several changes to almost all other aspects of how scraping works, to improve
its reliability and to reduce the amount of work I had to do.</p>
<p>I configured email alerts for when things fail, heuristics that alert me when a
scraping yields too many or too few products for that supermarket, timeouts, retries that don't
start from the beginning, etc.</p>
<p>All of these could be a post of their own, and maybe they will (write a comment if you
want!), but I want to highlight two other optimisations here.</p>
<p>The main bottleneck in this entire process is the duration of the scraping. The longer it
takes, the more I end up paying and the more annoying it is if something fails and it
needs to be retried from the beginning.</p>
<p>After lots of trial and error, two changes improved the times significantly: A bigger server and
reducing the amount of data that I fetch.</p>
<h3 id="use-a-bigger-server">Use a bigger server</h3>
<p>I went from 4vCPUs and 16GB of RAM to 8vCPUs and 16GB of RAM, which reduced
the duration by about ~20%, making it comparable to the performance I get on my MBP.
Also, because I'm only using the scraping server for ~2h the difference in price is negligible.</p>
<h3 id="fetch-fewer-things">Fetch fewer things</h3>
<p>Part of the truncated snippet above is this bit, taken straight from the <a href="https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page#page-route">playwright
docs</a>:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>def </span><span>visit_links</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):
</span><span>        images_regexp </span><span>= </span><span>re</span><span>.</span><span>compile</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>"(</span><span>\.</span><span>png</span><span>?</span><span>.</span><span>*</span><span>$</span><span>)</span><span>|</span><span>(</span><span>\.</span><span>jpg</span><span>.</span><span>*</span><span>$</span><span>)"</span><span>)
</span><span>        </span><span>for </span><span>index</span><span>, </span><span>link </span><span>in </span><span>enumerate</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>links):
</span><span>            </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>page</span><span>.</span><span>goto</span><span>(link)
</span><span>            </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>page</span><span>.</span><span>route</span><span>(images_regexp</span><span>, </span><span>lambda </span><span>route</span><span>: route</span><span>.</span><span>abort</span><span>())
</span><span>        </span><span>#
</span><span>        </span><span># &lt;truncated&gt;
</span><span>        </span><span>#
</span></code></pre>
<p>This aborts all requests to fetch images when I'm loading products. This not only makes
the scraping quicker, but also saves bandwidth and, presumably, a few cents, for the
websites.</p>
<p>While both of these are obvious in hindsight, sometimes it takes conscious effort to take
a step back and re-examine the problem at hand. It also helps to talk about it out loud,
either to a friend who knows or, even better, to a friend who doesn't know, for some
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber-duck debugging</a>.</p>
<h2 id="cost">Cost</h2>
<p>So how much does the scraping cost?</p>
<p>Accoring to the last invoice from Hetzner: €4.94 for the 31 servers I spinned up and €0.09 for the 31
IPv4 addresses they received.</p>
<p>The data from the scraping are saved in <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/developer-platform/r2/">Cloudflare's R2</a> where they have a
pretty generous 10GB free tier which I have not hit yet, so that's another €0.00 there.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are the main building blocks of how I built a scraping pipeline for
<a href="https://pricewatcher.gr/en">pricewatcher</a> in order to keep track of how supermarkets change their
prices.</p>

I'm Jamil Bou Kheir, founder of Firezone (<a href="https://www.firezone.dev/">https://www.firezone.dev</a>), a remote access platform that is a replacement for legacy corporate VPNs. Built on WireGuard (a fast, modern VPN protocol), Firezone secures your team’s apps, networks and services using access policies synced with your identity provider. You deploy tiny, self-contained binaries into your infrastructure anywhere you need access, and your workforce uses our client apps to reach the resources they protect.</p><p>Here’s a demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/QEv7dJwKMvo" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/QEv7dJwKMvo</a>.</p><p>Historically, the tool used to achieve this has been the corporate VPN. These work off a security model where you authenticate with the perimeter and gain access to the network behind it, which works when most workers are in office and resources on-prem. But as workers go remote and resources move to the cloud, the perimeter blurs, making it harder to secure.</p><p>I experienced this issue first-hand as a security engineer hunting for APT malware on Cisco's intranet. Malware often landed first on remote employee laptops, then spread from there to critical internal systems. Firewalls were somewhat effective at solving this problem, but they were clunky—it could take months for Infosec to approve requests to allow your team’s app or services through.</p><p>When Covid forced everyone to work from home, even Cisco struggled to grapple with the increased demand on its VPN concentrators. The perimeter defense model meant that we had to VPN into the intranet to get anything done, and if the speeds were really bad, we couldn't work that day.</p><p>One way to solve the above problems is to break up the single perimeter into many smaller ones, shifting them closer to the resources they protect. That way, compromising one perimeter does not gain you access to all others, and traffic is not bottlenecked through a single choke point. However, now you have many VPN tunnels instead of one, and most VPN protocols are too heavyweight for this.</p><p>If <i>Cisco</i> was facing these issues with remote access, I thought, others <i>must</i> be facing similar problems. So when WireGuard came along, I started Firezone.</p><p>WireGuard tunnels are so lightweight you can open thousands of them from an iPhone to whatever resources you need access to. Firezone builds on that and also handles NAT traversal, so you don’t need to change your firewall configuration to use it. Just deploy Gateways - small, statically-linked Linux binaries - where you need access, and Firezone’s homegrown STUN/TURN layer (we call “snownet”) handles the rest. If you need more throughput, just deploy more Gateways, and load is balanced across all of them.</p><p>WireGuard keys are distributed to peers only when access to a particular resource is authorized, and private keys never leave the device’s memory where they were generated. If a Gateway goes offline, Firezone will migrate connections from it to healthy ones within about 10 seconds, without user intervention. We lean heavily on Elixir/Phoenix and OTP’s awesome concurrency features to power all of this.</p><p>Firezone’s access control system is intentionally very simple. Policies define which user groups have access to which resources based on a default-deny system. More perimeters means more rules managing access to them, so we intentionally wanted to keep admins out of “ACL hell” as the number of controls grew.</p><p>One area we’re actively working to improve is our UI/UX - Firezone is a product built by engineers, for engineers, and at times, it shows! Expect refinements to come in this area over the coming months.</p><p>I’d love for you to give Firezone a try! You can spin up a demo instance at <a href="https://app.firezone.dev/try">https://app.firezone.dev/try</a> without signing up, and download clients from <a href="https://www.firezone.dev/kb/client-apps">https://www.firezone.dev/kb/client-apps</a>. And if you’re curious to learn more about how Firezone works, see for yourself - we build in the open at <a href="https://www.github.com/firezone/firezone">https://www.github.com/firezone/firezone</a>.</p><p>Thanks for reading, and I look forward to your feedback!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Written by Ming Ying on July 31, 2024</p>
<p><img src="https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/paradedb-blog/images/elastic_vs_postgres.png"></p><p>Over the past six months, we’ve spoken to 50+ companies who are looking for a full text search (FTS) solution over data stored
in Postgres. For many of these companies, the decision boils down to Elasticsearch vs. native Postgres full text search.</p>
<p>By working with these companies, we’ve identified the areas where each solution shines. Here’s what we’ve learned.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-full-text-search-fts"><span>What is Full Text Search (FTS)?</span></h2>
<p>Full text search is a technique that finds entries in a collection of text based on the presence of specific keywords and phrases.
Most search engines like Elasticsearch use the BM25 algorithm to rank search results. BM25 considers how often a term appears and how unique that term is across all documents.</p>
<p>Full text search is different from similarity search, also known as vector search, which searches for and ranks results by semantic meaning.
Many modern applications use a combination of full text and similarity search. This practice is called hybrid search and can yield more accurate results.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Postgres FTS</a> is a native functionality available to all Postgres
databases. It leverages the <code>tsvector</code> data type, which stores text as searchable tokens, and the GIN index, which improves search
speeds.</p>
<h3 id="the-good"><span>The Good</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>. Postgres FTS requires no additional infrastructure and is available on all managed Postgres services like AWS RDS. In the long run, not having to orchestrate and manage an external search engine saves significant time and headache.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Search</strong>. With Postgres FTS, data is searchable immediately upon commit. This can be incredibly useful to companies building user-facing or latency-sensitive search experiences — for instance, e-commerce sites or fintechs.</li>
<li><strong>Postgres Transactions and MVCC</strong>. Postgres’ ACID transactions and multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) ensure that FTS results are reliable under concurrent access and frequent updates.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-bad"><span>The Bad</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Feature Incomplete</strong>. The limited feature set of Postgres FTS may be a deal breaker for some companies. Missing features include BM25 scoring, relevance tuning, custom tokenizers, and faceting.</li>
<li><strong>Poor Performance Over Large Datasets</strong>. While Postgres FTS performs well over tables with a few million rows, performance degrades considerably over tables with tens of millions of rows.</li>
<li><strong>Transactional Overhead</strong>. Creating a GIN index over a column adds a small amount (usually milliseconds) of latency to transactions that affect that column.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="key-takeaway"><span>Key Takeaway</span></h3>
<p>Postgres FTS is ideal for search over small to medium-sized tables that do not require sophisticated FTS queries. We’re being intentionally vague about what “medium-sized” and “sophisticated” entail — the specifics vary depending on your performance requirements. Luckily, testing and migrating to/from Postgres FTS is fairly straightforward.</p>
<h2 id="elasticsearch"><span>Elasticsearch</span></h2>
<p>While Elastic today offers a wide variety of products, its core product, Elasticsearch, is a data store and full text search engine.</p>
<h3 id="the-good-2"><span>The Good</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Feature Set</strong>. Elasticsearch is capable of handling almost any FTS query. The Elastic Query DSL (domain-specific language) is the gold standard for full text search capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Performant</strong>. Our <a href="https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/benchmarks#results" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">benchmarks</a> show that Elasticsearch can query billions of rows in milliseconds thanks to its underlying battle-tested Lucene search engine and distributed architecture.</li>
<li><strong>More than Search</strong>. Beyond FTS, Elasticsearch is also an analytical query engine, vector database, security and observability platform. Many organizations enjoy the simplicity of consolidating several services within Elasticsearch.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-bad-2"><span>The Bad</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Not a Reliable Data Store</strong>. We’ve talked to many companies who have tried and regretted their decision to use Elasticsearch as their primary data store. This is not a practice we recommend — Elasticsearch’s lack of ACID transactions and MVCC can lead to data inconsistencies and loss, while its lack of relational properties and real-time consistency makes many database queries challenging.</li>
<li><strong>Requires ETL Pipelines</strong>. Because Elasticsearch is not a reliable data store, organizations that use Postgres typically extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from Postgres to Elasticsearch. Because failures in ETL pipelines can lead to all sorts of production outages, these pipelines need to be carefully maintained to avoid breaking changes in the underlying Postgres schema.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Data Freshness</strong>. ETL jobs are time-consuming and run at periodic intervals. Data that reaches Elasticsearch often lags several hours behind Postgres, which may be prohibitive for applications that perform real-time search over Postgres tables.</li>
<li><strong>Expensive</strong>. We were surprised to hear from several enterprises that Elasticsearch had grown to become their largest software expense. As the cost of their Elasticsearch clusters ballooned, many of these enterprises switched from Elasticsearch Cloud to self-managed. While this reduced their cloud spend, it introduced a new problem: Elasticsearch is notoriously difficult to run, tune, and manage. These organizations then hired (expensive) engineers to manage their Elasticsearch clusters.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="key-takeaway-2"><span>Key Takeaway</span></h3>
<p>Elasticsearch delivers excellent search performance at the price of operational overhead and data freshness. We recommend Elasticsearch if more lightweight alternatives cannot get the job done or if you intend on using other Elasticsearch services.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-search-engines"><span>Alternative Search Engines</span></h2>
<p>Over the years, a modern breed of search engines like Algolia, Meilisearch, and Typesense has emerged. These engines are commonly used to build user-facing search experiences. <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hacker News search</a>, for instance, is built on Algolia.</p>
<p>While each service differentiates around the edges, there’s an important caveat for developers looking for search over Postgres: none of these solutions are built specifically for Postgres. Users of Postgres will likely experience many of the same problems with these services as they would with Elasticsearch.</p>
<h2 id="is-the-best-of-both-worlds-possible"><span>Is the Best of Both Worlds Possible?</span></h2>
<p>ParadeDB is a full text search engine built for Postgres. Powered by an extension called <code>pg_search</code>, ParadeDB embeds Tantivy, a Rust-based Lucene alternative, inside Postgres. Like native Postgres FTS, ParadeDB plugs into any existing, self-managed Postgres database with no additional infrastructure. Like Elasticsearch, ParadeDB provides the capabilities of an advanced full text search engine.</p>
<p>Compatibility with managed Postgres services like Amazon RDS is coming soon. To get notified when it’s ready, we invite you to fill out our <a href="https://form.typeform.com/to/jHkLmIzx?typeform-source=paradedb.typeform.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">interest form</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>T</span>he glass is narrow at the bottom but bulges out a third of the way to the top. As with the classic British “nonik” pint, the bulge makes the glass easier to stack and gives your thumb and index finger somewhere to rest. The name is spelled in fading letters near the rim and means “super tight” or “super strong” in German, which one might assume to be a reference to the drinker’s solid grip. In fact, it hails the glass’s extraordinary durability.</p><p>This is Superfest, East Germany’s “unbreakable” drinking glass. Invented in the industry-rich but resource-poor socialist German Democratic Republic, Superfest glasses were designed with the aim of making them last five times longer than ordinary drinking glasses. They were soon found to be 10 times more durable.</p><p>The company that made them went bankrupt after the fall of the Berlin Wall, but as contemporary designers are exploring more eco-friendly and sustainable production methods, the 120m Superfest glasses produced between 1980 and 1990 are more in demand than ever, fetching about €35 (£30) a pop on online marketplaces such as eBay and Etsy. Some designers even dream of bringing the technology behind them back into production.</p><p>As objects mostly made to be seen through rather than seen, drinking glasses are an oddly overlooked category of homeware design. Even when they are recognised as works of art, their value tends to be set by what goes in them. A Kurt Zalto wine glass or a Tom Dixon whisky tumbler will fetch good money at auctions; the humble water glass usually doesn’t.</p><p>In the case of the Superfest glass, the anonymity of the makers was also politically desired. The GDR’s regime preached solidarity and unity. The prevailing ideology regarded the collective more highly than the talents and abilities of the individual. Even though Superfest glasses were ubiquitous in every bar, canteen and household in the Soviet satellite state, few people had heard of Paul Bittner, Fritz Keuchel and Tilo Poitz, the design collective who gave them their shape. “Not a living soul had any idea who actually designed Superfest,” says Günter Höhne, who from 1984-1989, in the GDR’s twilight years, worked as editor-in-chief for the country’s leading journal for industrial design, Form und Zweck.</p><figure id="eb357685-64fb-466c-b92c-66e2de33ab07" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.VideoYoutubeBlockElement"><div data-component="youtube-embed"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HM6kBrXTeNM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed" title="Superfeste Gläser, DDR-Design" height="480" width="854" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></figure><p>For their range of glasses – which included variants for champagne, schnapps and cognac as well as three different sizes for beer – the designer trio were inspired by the equally beautiful so-called <em>Wirteglas</em>, which the East German designers Margarete Jahny and Erich Müller created in the early 1970s.</p><p>The groundbreaking technology they deployed was developed in the 1970s at the Department for Glass Structure Research at the Central Institute for Inorganic Chemistry near Dresden. The material scientists there knew that when glass breaks, it is typically due to microscopic cracks in the material’s surface which form during the production process. Dramatically increasing the toughness of the glass surface was possible, they found, by replacing the smaller sodium ions in the glass with electronically charged potassium ions. Potassium ions need more space, pressing harder against neighbouring atoms and building up more tension that needs to be overcome for the microscopic cracks to get bigger.</p><p>“A huge amount of technical groundwork was done to produce a glass like that,” says Höhne, who is the author of several books about industrial design in the GDR. Nonetheless, the state-owned company that specialised in this technology, VEB Sachsenglas Schwepnitz, ceased production in 1990, a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Hundreds of employees received redundancy notices, and scrap dealers came to pick up melting moulds, plant components and machines.</p><figure id="e9568ee3-c45b-4576-a92c-9257f41cab8f" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6d5f4f16455ecbda1767d1f5e8290697111faf7/0_197_5922_3553/master/5922.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6d5f4f16455ecbda1767d1f5e8290697111faf7/0_197_5922_3553/master/5922.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6d5f4f16455ecbda1767d1f5e8290697111faf7/0_197_5922_3553/master/5922.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6d5f4f16455ecbda1767d1f5e8290697111faf7/0_197_5922_3553/master/5922.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6d5f4f16455ecbda1767d1f5e8290697111faf7/0_197_5922_3553/master/5922.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6d5f4f16455ecbda1767d1f5e8290697111faf7/0_197_5922_3553/master/5922.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="‘Glass only has one disadvantage’ … Paul Kupfer, Soulbottles co-founder" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6d5f4f16455ecbda1767d1f5e8290697111faf7/0_197_5922_3553/master/5922.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="266.9849712934819" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘There’s only one disadvantage’ … Paul Kupfer, the Soulbottles co-founder bringing shatter-resistant glass back to market.</span> Photograph: Courtesy: Soulbottles</figcaption></figure><p>One factor that may have hindered Superfest’s competitiveness in a unified Germany was its functionalist, austere look. Especially in southern parts of the country, drinkers like to swig their beer from glasses decorated with gold edging or engraved coats of arms. “Baroque decoration on a Superfest glass wouldn’t work,” says Höhne. “It would violate the design itself.”</p><p>But the main reason for its decline, paradoxically, was its strength. Glass retailers who play by the rules of the market live off the fact that their products break, so they can sell more. A glass that didn’t break was a threat to profits. “It turned out that Superfest is not suited for the market,” says Höhne. “The glasses are too good for pure market thinking.”</p><p>Today, the highly durable glasses can only be bought secondhand – but a Berlin startup is trying to change that. As sustainability has risen up the agenda, the company Soulbottles believes customers are prepared to pay higher prices for high quality and durable products.</p><p>Its founders, Paul Kupfer and Steve Köhler, have crowdfunded €251,139 (£215,400) for a production facility that partially draws on Superfest’s old GDR-era ion technology.</p><p>“Compared to plastic, glass is a material that can be recycled almost as often as you like,” says Köhler<strong>.</strong> “It is tasteless and transparent, and it has only one disadvantage: it breaks.”</p><p>The problem with the original Superfest glass is that its manufacturers worked with modified alumino or borosilicate glass, which is not as easy to recycle as the more common soda-lime glass. So Soulbottles’ challenge is to produce glass that is both durable and recyclable. Initial tests were promising, and delivery of the first bottles is expected next year. How strong are they? Well the prototypes were dropped from a height of two metres – and didn’t smash.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://protonvpn.com/blog/stealth-vpn-protocol">https://protonvpn.com/blog/stealth-vpn-protocol</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41173089">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><time datetime="2024-08-06T11:55:39">Published on August 6, 2024</time> </p> 
<p><strong>We’ve developed a new VPN protocol, Stealth, that can avoid detection and let you bypass internet censorship and VPN blocks.</strong></p>



<p>We’re pleased to announce Stealth, a new, undetectable VPN protocol that can bypass most firewalls and VPN blocking methods. You’ll be able to bypass advanced VPN blocks, access censored sites, and communicate with people on social media, even if your government is trying to restrict access.</p>



<h2>Why is Stealth needed?</h2>



<p>In 2017, we launched Proton VPN because there was no trustworthy, reliable, and freely available VPN service. Our motivation was simple. Because our services, such as Proton Mail, play a crucial role in ensuring freedom and privacy worldwide, we knew authoritarian governments would eventually try to block them. </p>



<p>But with Proton VPN, people can bypass those blocks and continue using Proton Mail. Over the past few years, Proton VPN has become an essential tool, helping ensure the free flow of information for tens of millions of people during crises and wars around the world.</p>



<p>Since we launched Proton VPN, we’ve continuously worked on technology to bypass surveillance and censorship. For example, in 2017, we launched <a rel="" target="_self" href="https://protonvpn.com/support/secure-core-vpn/">Secure Core VPN</a>, which provides greater privacy than typical VPN services. </p>



<p>In 2020, we launched <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://proton.me/blog/anti-censorship-alternative-routing">alternative routing<span>(new window)</span></a>, which bypasses VPN blocks by re-routing our connections over other hard-to-trace paths. Finally, in 2021, we released <a href="https://protonvpn.com/secure-vpn/vpn-accelerator">VPN Accelerator</a>, a unique technology that provides connection speeds that are up to 400% faster, which is critically important for users in far-flung regions with slower internet.</p>



<p>As we have stepped up our efforts to build a more censorship-resistant VPN, authoritarian governments have also stepped up their efforts to block VPNs. Traditional <a rel="" target="_self" href="https://protonvpn.com/blog/whats-the-best-vpn-protocol/">VPN protocols</a> (such as OpenVPN, IKEv2, and WireGuard) are relatively easy to recognize on a network. And as deep packet inspection (DPI) technology becomes more widespread, it will be easier and easier for authoritarian governments to detect and block VPNs using these protocols. </p>



<p>For years there have been various projects to try to obfuscate existing VPN protocols, but many of them are hacks on top of existing protocols that unfortunately no longer work very well.</p>



<p>We designed our Stealth protocol from the ground up to not have these issues. With Stealth enabled, your Proton VPN connection will be almost completely undetectable.</p>



<p>Stealth is available on all Proton VPN plans, including our Free plan, because everyone deserves online freedom. For now, you can use Stealth on our Android, Windows, macOS, and iOS apps.</p>











<h2 id="Blog-HowdoIuseStealth?">How do I use Stealth?</h2>



<p>To activate Stealth, open the Proton VPN app on your device.</p>



<ul>
<li>On Android,  tap <strong>☰</strong> →  <strong>Settings</strong> → <strong>Advanced</strong> → <strong>Protocol</strong> and choose <strong>Stealth</strong>.</li>



<li> On Windows, tap<strong> ☰</strong> <strong>Settings → Connection → Protocol and choose Stealth.</strong></li>



<li>On iOS and iPadOS, tap&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;→<strong>&nbsp;Security options</strong>&nbsp;→&nbsp;<strong>Protocol</strong>&nbsp;and choose&nbsp;<strong>Stealth</strong>.</li>



<li>On macOS,&nbsp;<strong>ProtonVPN</strong>&nbsp;in the macOS taskbar →&nbsp;<strong>Preferences</strong>&nbsp;→&nbsp;<strong>Connection</strong>&nbsp;→&nbsp;<strong>Protocol</strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<strong>Stealth</strong>&nbsp;from the dropdown menu.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Stealth is not yet available on our Linux app.</p>



<p><a rel="" target="_self" href="https://protonvpn.com/support/how-to-change-vpn-protocols/"><strong>Learn more about changing VPN protocols</strong></a></p>



<h2 id="Blog-HowdoestheStealthVPNprotocolwork?">How does the Stealth VPN protocol work?</h2>



<p>Stealth uses obfuscation to hide your VPN connection from censors. The general idea is to make VPN traffic look like “normal” traffic&nbsp;—&nbsp;or common HTTPS connections. Stealth does this by using obfuscated TLS tunneling over TCP. This is different from most popular VPN protocols that typically use UDP, making them easier to detect and block. Without going into too much detail, Stealth also establishes VPN connections in a specific and unique way that avoids alerting internet filters.</p>



<p>Despite these obfuscation features, the Stealth VPN protocol is also optimized for high performance and is compatible with our VPN Accelerator technology. Coupled with our lightweight internals, Stealth can achieve higher performance than older obfuscated VPN protocols that are generally built on top of OpenVPN over TCP.</p>



<h2 id="Blog-Thefightcontinues"><strong>The fight continues</strong></h2>



<p>We want to thank the members of the Proton community who helped us test the Stealth VPN protocol over the last couple of months. They live under restrictive censorship regimes, and Stealth would have been impossible to develop without their assistance. Thank you.</p>



<p>However, in the constantly evolving battle for online freedom, our work is not finished. Accordingly, we designed Stealth to be an extensible and adaptable VPN protocol that is flexible enough to meet new challenges.</p>



<p>The cause of freedom has no borders, and we must stand together for it to succeed. Tools like Proton VPN play a vital role in keeping the internet free.&nbsp;Our investment in technologies like Stealth is part of our commitment to provide internet privacy to everyone, regardless of their ability to pay.</p>



<p>Proton VPN will always be free, but if you would like to support our mission to keep the internet free and open to all, you can subscribe to a paid plan which offers even faster speeds and premium features.</p>











<p>P.S. We want to say thanks to the hundreds of Proton VPN community members who suggested names for our new protocol. Your top choice was Neutrino, which we liked a lot because of the connection to physics.&nbsp;And neutrinos can pass through all matter, making it even more appropriate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, we felt this name might cause confusion with a Web3 project, so we picked Stealth instead. This was another popular community suggestion, and its meaning is more obvious to those less familiar with physics.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Dell has made another round of layoffs, which <em>The Register</em> understands have cut deep and seen even company veterans let go.</p>
<p>HR exit meetings kicked off on Tuesday morning, spurring a wave of LinkedIn status changes, while others found comfort venting or trading information in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thelayoff.com/dell">online forums</a>.</p>
<p>Dell confirmed the layoffs to <em>The Register</em>.</p>

    

<p>"Through a reorganization of our go-to-market teams and an ongoing series of actions, we are becoming a leaner company. We are combining teams and prioritizing where we invest across the company. We continually evolve our business, so we're set up to deliver the best innovation, value and service to our customers and partners," Dell told <i>The Register</i> by email.</p>

        


        

<p>The sentiment was also <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-05/dell-layoffs-hit-sales-team-with-new-unit-focused-on-ai">reportedly</a>expressed in a memo sent to some employees as they watched colleagues pack up their belongings.</p>
<p>In the memo, president of global sales and customer operations Bill Scannell and global channels president John Byrne used the term "streamlining layers of management."</p>

        

<p>According to Scannell and Byrne, Dell aims to grow faster than the market by unlocking "the value of modern IT and AI" for customer organizations.</p>
<p>Implied was that they would be doing this without the help of an undisclosed number of newly former employees. That number has been <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/WhatLayoff/status/1820595751849693413">guesstimated</a> at around ten percent of the workforce – about 12,500 people – as part of an effort to get the overall workforce from 120,000 to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/03/dell_return_to_work/">below 100,000</a>.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/20/dell_rto_mandate/">Staff say Dell's return to office mandate is a stealth layoff, especially for women</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/10/tech_job_cuts_gitlab_microsoft/">Tech job bonfire rages on as Microsoft, GitLab and others join in</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/20/half_of_dell_us_staff_wfh/">Half of Dell US staff reportedly opted for remote work</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/15/ai_implementation_challenges/">Everyone's talking about AI but industry reps say few are ready to implement</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/05/stock_market_outages/">Stock-trading apps fall under the feet of stampeding panicking investors</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is unknown if this round of cuts met that target, or if further firings will follow – particularly as many suspicious 1:1 meetings scheduled for Tuesday were <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thelayoff.com/t/1tSY0Var">allegedly</a> moved.</p>
<p>As one employee <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thelayoff.com/t/1tRHybgc">put it</a>: "There are only so many HR reps to go around." A prophetic musing, as Dell's Human Resources department was <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thelayoff.com/t/1tRJUooS">allegedly</a> too swamped to even show up for some terminations – leaving the job instead to line managers.</p>
<p>Severance for most will likely <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thelayoff.com/t/1tRdSXcr">involve</a> a payout of two months wages plus a week per year served up to a max of 26 weeks, and potential partial bonus payouts. Loyal Dell graybeards have <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thelayoff.com/t/1tRJ8ZuF">grumbled</a> about losing long-term incentives and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thelayoff.com/t/1tRIaBSr">stock options</a>.</p>

        

<p>Some employees have reported seeing the workforce reduction writing on the wall. "I work in advertising and recently learned that Dell's fall print budgets were cut two weeks ago, which makes sense. Additionally, Intel had issued a major RFP that they withdrew last week, just before the news broke about their mass layoffs and stock decline," claimed <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thelayoff.com/t/1tSaEMwD">one employee</a>.</p>
<p>"With how frequent the layoffs have been I can't trust there won't be more in the future. I've survived so far but almost half my team is gone now versus two years ago," <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thelayoff.com/t/1tSrZvnR">pondered</a> another Dell-ite who has decided to seek employment elsewhere.</p>
<p>One Redditor <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1ekwl3n/comment/lgnq3za/">referred</a> to the regular layoffs endured by Dell employees as the yearly "rank and yank."</p>
<p>Last year was special – much like this year – when it came to the numbers seen in its rank and yank. The PC giant <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/06/dell_job_cuts/">announced</a> a reduction of around five percent of its workforce, but ended up with double that – cutting 13,000 over the 2023 fiscal year, according to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-26/dell-layoffs-hit-13-000-employees-over-the-past-year">reports</a>.</p>
<p>The same year, Dell <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/10/dell_remote_work_revision/">called</a> its workforce back to the office after previously promising the workplace would forever stay primarily remote or hybrid. Many saw the mandate to return as a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/20/dell_rto_mandate/">stealth layoff</a> that disproportionately harmed women.</p>
<p>Dell's layoffs come one week after Intel <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/01/intel_to_ax_headcount/">announced</a> it will shed 15 percent of its payroll as the x86 giant scrambles to get its finances under control. That could be tricky as it is occupied with damage control having missed the AI market, suffered a revenue slump, confronted additional competition in the PC space, and admitted its Raptor Lake chips are <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/23/intel_raptor_lake_instability_fix/">frying systems</a>.</p>
<p>The next day, Intel stock took a 26 percent hit.</p>
<p>Dell was also <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4134242-dell-reduces-sales-team-as-it-prioritizes-ai-report">reportedly</a> down three percent during afternoon trading on Monday – which, in comparison to this week's <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/05/stock_market_outages/">stock market wobble</a>, seemed par for the course.</p>
<p>The decreased need for employees could also be sign that Dell is engaging more with partners and less with in-house sales. Many of the positions eliminated appear to come from the sales division. Last August Dell announced its <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.delltechnologies.com/partner/en-sg/partner/partner-first-storage.htm">Partner First For Storage</a> strategy – an initiative aimed at boosting sales through the channel. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Last couple of weeks I have been working on one, if not the, largest refactors of my life. We have completely rewritten
the string/binary data structure we use in Polars. This was a refactor I wanted to do for a long time, but we couldn’t
as several factors were not ready at the time.</p>
<p>Initially Polars was a consumer of the Arrow2 crate (native Rust implementation of the Arrow spec). This meant that we
couldn’t change the string type as the goal of the Arrow2 project was to follow the complete Arrow spec. End of last
year we forked parts of Arrow2 in the crate <code>polars-arrow</code>, which is a trimmed down implementation of the Arrow spec and
is tuned for Polars’ needs.</p>
<p>Now we have the code under our control the refactor was imminent. As luck would have it, the Arrow spec was also finally
making progress with adding the long anticipated German Style string types to the specification. Which, spoiler alert,
is the type we implemented. These changes are not user facing and the only thing that is required from a user perspective
is upgrading to the latest Polars version.</p>
<p><small>If Arrow wouldn’t gone through with it, we would have. The goal of Polars is to have good interop with Arrow, but
we might deviate from certain types if they better suite our needs.</small></p>
<h2 id="1-why-the-change">1. Why the change?</h2>
<p>Let’s take a step back. We haven’t touched on the reason for the change yet. The string type that was supported by the
Apache Arrow spec was defined by three buffers. If we ignore the validity buffer (that indicates if data is valid or
not), this is represented by Arrows’s default string type as follows. In the following example we hold a 3 rows
<code>DataFrame</code> with artist names:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="text"><code><span><span>shape: (3, 1)</span></span>
<span><span>┌────────────────────────┐</span></span>
<span><span>│ band                   │</span></span>
<span><span>│ ---                    │</span></span>
<span><span>│ str                    │</span></span>
<span><span>╞════════════════════════╡</span></span>
<span><span>│ ABBA                   │</span></span>
<span><span>│ The Velvet Underground │</span></span>
<span><span>│ Toots And The Maytals  │</span></span>
<span><span>└────────────────────────┘</span></span>
<span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>All the string data would be stored contiguously in a single <code>data</code> buffer. And to keep track of the start and end of
the strings, an extra buffer was allocated containing the offsets (Yes signed integers, because Arrow needs to interact
with Java).</p>
<p><img src="https://pola.rs/_astro/band_names_strings.C_AyfDMg_Z2lLsLe.webp" alt="default arrow encoding" width="841" height="159" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h3 id="11-the-good">1.1 The good</h3>
<p>The positive thing about encoding string data like this, is that it is rather compact. All string allocations are
amortized into a single buffer. This immediately has a downside as it is very hard to predict the size of your
allocation up front. Per string we only have a single 64bit integer overhead (ignoring the starting <code>0</code>). Accessing the
string requires an extra indirection, but sequential traversal is all local, so this is definitely cache friendly.</p>
<h3 id="12-the-bad">1.2 The bad</h3>
<p>As I mentioned above already pre-allocating the required size of <code>data</code> is hard. This leads to many reallocations and
<code>memcopy</code>’s during the building of this type. However, this downside is very relative. The huge (in my opinion
pathological) downside of the this data type is that the <code>gather</code> and <code>filter</code> operation on this type scale linear in
time complexity with the string sizes. So if you have $n$ rows and on average $k$ bytes in your strings, materializing
the output of a <code>join</code> operation would require $O(n \cdot k)$. This is ok if $k$ is small (which it often is), but when
there is large string (or binary) data stored, this gets very expensive.</p>
<p>Because a <code>gather</code> (taking rows by index) and <code>filter</code> (taking rows by boolean mask) are such core operations that are
used by a lot of other operations (<code>group-by</code>, <code>join</code>, <code>window-functions</code> etc.) having large string data could really
run a query to a halt.</p>
<h2 id="2-hyperumbra-style-string-storage">2. Hyper/Umbra style string storage</h2>
<p>The solution we (and the Arrow spec) adopted is designed by the
<a href="https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2020/papers/p29-neumann-cidr20.pdf">Hyper/Umbra</a> database system. Here the strings are
stored as 16 bytes in a column (called a “view”). When the string has a length <code>&lt;=</code> 12 bytes, the string data is inlined
and the view contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 bytes for the length: <code>u32</code></li>
<li>4 bytes containing a prefix of the string data.</li>
<li>8 bytes stores the remainder of the string (zero-padded)</li>
</ul>
<p>When the string is larger than 12 bytes, it is stored in a secondary buffer and the view contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 bytes for the length: <code>u32</code></li>
<li>4 bytes containing a prefix of the string data.</li>
<li>4 bytes for the buffer index</li>
<li>4 bytes for the string offset (in the buffer)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://pola.rs/_astro/umbra_strings.6-lMqmZD_1XkuYt.webp" alt="hyper_string_encoding" width="927" height="702" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h3 id="21-the-good">2.1 The good</h3>
<p>Storing string data like this has several benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li>For small strings, all string data can be inlined in the views, meaning we don’t incur an indirection on access.</li>
<li>Because the views are fixed width and larger string buffers can be appended, we can also mutate existing columns.</li>
<li>Large strings can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning">interned</a>, which can save a lot of space and
allows for dictionary encoding large string data in the default string data type. This is partially encoding, as we
always need to allocate the views.</li>
<li>Operations that produce new values from existing columns, e.g. <code>filter</code>, <code>gather</code> and all supersets of operations that
use these, now can copy an element in constant time. Only the views are gathered (and sometimes updated) and the
buffers can remain as is.</li>
<li>Many operations can be smart with this data structure and only work on (parts of the) views. We already optimized many
of our string kernels with this, and more will follow.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="22-the-bad">2.2 The bad</h3>
<p>As always, there are trade-offs. Every data structure also has some downsides, however for this one they are not
pathological anymore. Downsides are:</p>
<ul>
<li>storing unique strings requires slightly more space. The default Arrow string has 8 bytes overhead per string element.
This binary view encoding has 16 bytes overhead per long string, or <code>4 bytes (length) + 12 - string length</code> for small
strings. In my opinion, this is totally worth it considering we can elide an indirection and have fixed width random
storage.</li>
<li>What I consider the biggest downside is that we have to do garbage collection. When we <code>gather</code>/<code>filter</code> from an array
with allocated long strings, we might keep strings alive that are not used anymore. This requires us to use some
heuristics to determine when we will do a garbage collection pass on the string column. And because they are
heuristics, sometimes they will be unneeded.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-benchmarks">3. Benchmarks</h2>
<p>This was a huge effort, and we are very glad this wasn’t in vain. Below we show the results various <code>filter</code> operations
with different selectivities (percentage of values that evaluate <code>true</code>). For each of this plot/benchmark we prepared a
<code>DataFrame</code> with 16 columns (equal to the number of cores) of string data. The string data was sampled with the
following patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>small: sample strings between 1 - 12 bytes.</li>
<li>medium: sample strings between 1 - 201 bytes, thereby mixing inlined and externally allocated strings.</li>
<li>large: sample strings of ~500 bytes representing large JSON objects.</li>
</ul>
<p><small>We use 16 columns because earlier Polars versions masked the pathological case by throwing more parallelism in
the mix. By ensuring we use 16 columns, this extra parallelism will not help.</small></p>
<p>These benchmarks were run on a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m6i/">m6i.4xlarge</a> AWS instance. The results
are huge improvement. Almost all cases outperform the old string type and the pathological cases are completely
resolved. As we go from $O(n \cdot k)$ to $O(n)$, the <code>filter</code> performance is completely independent from the string
length <code>k</code>.</p>



<h2 id="4-more-to-come">4. More to come</h2>
<p>Now Polars has its Arrow related code in its repository, we are able to tune our memory buffers more tightly for our
use-case. We expect more performance increases to come from this, and are happy with the tight control we can now
exercise over our full data-stack. Rewriting the string data-type was one such exercise. More to come!</p>
