And recently, I’ve opened Armstrong’s Handbook of Human Resource Management Practice to read a few chapters on a problem I’m facing at work.<p>And WOW a proper book on the topic is SOOO much better than any random article that I find, be it from SWLW, HN, Reddit, or any other source. Articles and posts are easy to like when I already agree with their premise. But the depth of a proper book, from a real source of authority and not some random person online, looking at the problem from multiple points, that’s so much more insightful and useful.</p><p>So instead of hunting for best articles, I would 100% recommend getting Armstrong, or some textbook. Or at least High Output Management as other comment suggested, or some other well known and well regarded book. But Armstrong in particular can give you very deep understanding of most aspects of people management, plus it’s up-to-date.

It's about how the US Marine Corps thinks about leadership.  No, he doesn't tell you to shout at people.  But he does show how they lead in more difficult circumstances than most of us will ever encounter, and how they help people from wildly different backgrounds work together.<p>Speaking of learning from people with completely different perspectives, if you want to learn about public speaking, read Do You Talk Funny?, by Nihill.  The thesis is that good standup comedians are the best public speakers, and that we can learn their techniques.  Much of what they do well has nothing to do with being funny.

I do think it's probably a bit too cynical though, probably colored by the author's own world-view and personal experience. I do think that some companies are just filled with BS; don't get me wrong. But I think that there are also a subset of companies who are filled with people trying their best, but who are making mistakes and/or being incompetent in a way that looks like the active sabotage that OP is describing. I think when there's a power imbalance it's easy to ascribe every non-perfect action by people above you to be some act of self-interest, when in reality it isn't always true that everyone has a secret ulterior motive.<p>&gt; From the founders's perspective the org is basically an overactive genie. It will do what you say, but not what you mean. Want to increase sales in two quarters? No problem, sales increased. Oh, and we also subtly destroyed our customers's trust. Once the stakes are high, founders basically have to treat their org as an adversarial agent. You might think -- but a good founder will notice! Doesn't matter how good you are -- you've selected world class politicians that are good at getting past your exact psychological makeup.</p><p>This is a particularly good quote!

Instead, find the right people.<p>First understand that management is administrative: accountability, task completion, retention, hiring. Leadership is direction, purpose, and motivation. The concepts are not related. Leaders own things and take risks. Managers balance spreadsheets. If you are an extreme introvert or find it difficult to be assertive you have a tremendous amount of catching up to do.</p><p>Secondly, your best source of knowledge is experience from people with proven delivery. Find them and ask them tough questions. Compare yourself to your managerial peers to determine if you are developing appropriately or if you are sucking. Do not look to your peers or the public for leadership guidance as they will set you up to fail, especially in software. If you really want to become a solid manager look for harsh criticism from the leaders you work for AND a path forward.</p><p>Finally, pay close attention to the measures and metrics of your staff. Such measures will include staff retention, speed of delivery, product performance, and so forth.</p><p>To help jump start your journey here is leadership according to the US Army: ADP 6-22, <a href="https://armypubs.army.mil/ProductMaps/PubForm/Details.aspx?PUB_ID=1007609" rel="nofollow">https://armypubs.army.mil/ProductMaps/PubForm/Details.aspx?P...</a>

"Natural born leaders" by personality type tend to be overconfident and ignore their blindspots because they've never had a reason to challenge their ability.</p><p>Introverts, for example, are acutely aware that leading and managing doesn't come naturally and is a skill that is continually learned and built upon. In the long-run, introverts can be excellent leaders because they're aware of what it takes to be a good leader and they put an emphasis on professional development to get where they need to be.</p><p>Not to say extroverts are worse leaders. Both introverts and extroverts can be terrible leaders/managers. The best leaders/managers are the ones who have the self-awareness to reflect on themselves, identify their week points, and constantly improve.

The other big ones were humility/thoughtfulness, honesty, and grace under pressure.  (Perhaps the original lecture addresses those, as well.)<p>I don't know the research on this (and would be hesitant to believe anything out of the business press about management).  I only have anecdata, intuition, and speculation.</p><p>I'm not perfect at any of these, but they seem to be a really good guide.</p><p>Note that not everyone has picked up the same influences in the past, so they might not have seen all of these, and they might've learned a lot of other ideas.</p><p>For examples of other influences (not just managers, but execs including startups): Many seem to prioritize projecting confidence, over everything else.  Others seem wired to persuade, to doing what they want or to having a positive impression of them, at all costs.  Others seem to think they must assert authority, first and foremost.</p><p>The difference in past experiences, and the reality of industry conventions in practice, means you sometimes have to explain something that seems obvious to you.</p><p>One time I failed to communicate well, I was characterizing to a startup CEO how I'd run a forthcoming engineering team, and I added something at the end, "and they'll be my people".  I intended it as shorthand for a style of conscientiously looking after their needs, and fostering a culture of loyalty to the team/project/company.  Of course that was ambiguous, especially in a business context, where aggressive self-interest is the most likely explanation for any behavior.  Later, I realized that he was looking to be the leader of more of a lifestyle company, with the entire company <i>his</i> people in a somewhat different sense (which was an influence he'd seen in his own career).  So I'd maybe sounded like I was saying I'd silo off a fiefdom of loyalists to me rather than to him or the company, shape part of the company in my image, or otherwise get between him and the people.

Everyone in a corporate structure is a servant.  How you advance is by demonstrating that you are helping solve the problems deemed important by your chain of command.  Theoretically this should be aligned from top to bottom; in practice competing priorities, communication overhead, and incompetence in the wrong places can greatly distort things.  This reality leads a lot of folks into learned helplessness, and social climbers gaming the chaos to gain power they are not equipped to handle.<p>The mentality "what's in it for me" is toxic and shows one is not ready for higher level management in a large org where cooperation is necessary to do anything interesting.  Better questions are "is my team working on the right thing?", "does my team have the right skills to deliver on that thing?", "what relationships do we need to succeed?", and last but definitely not least "is my manager competent enough to provide the support I need for my team to be successful?".  The last question is the key one: you won't grow if you are reporting to a muppet.

You're right that it's not inherently toxic to think of yourself.  The reason I reacted that way is because that mentality (whether explicit or not) is what leads to operating in a very transactional way or empire-building fashion that works against good outcomes in the long-term.<p>I honestly don't think being too selfless is an adequate explanation for career stagnation though.  Selfless behavior will generally help you get ahead in life and in your career, because good relationships matter a lot.  However you won't get promoted just because you help everyone.  What if you are just servicing the squeaky wheels rather than solving the biggest problem on your plate?  A good manager will only look to promote you because you have demonstrated you are capable of solving larger problems.  There are other things too: like the business actually has the need for a higher level role.  If that's the case, then your behavior is irrelevant—you just need to leave to someplace that <i>does</i> have the growth opportunity.</p><p>Overall the reason I said your comment was strange is because it clearly comes from some personal experience you had, but it lacks enough context to be actionable to anyone who reads it.  I can think of a dozen different ways I've seen a "servant leader" mentality succeed or fail, but it all depends very much on context.  Ultimately if you want to succeed you need to understand what game is being played and not fallback to abstract platitudes.

In a healthy engineering culture, a management goal should be enabling the maximum number of people to exercise their own leadership. Even the newfangled concept of "servant leadership" is premised on a separation of agency between those who "serve/lead" and those who "are served/led".<p>Effective management --- do not groan before I finish this sentence --- tends to look a lot more like adminship on Wikipedia than it does, like, war leadership. It's about picking up a mop and a bucket and making the way clear for people to do their best work. And, in our field, doing one's best work often means <i>making and communicating big decisions</i>, which is what leadership is.</p><p>There's also a distinction between the kind of leadership the whole company needs --- hard decisions about where to allocate resources and what bets to make --- and the day-to-day "leadership" involved in getting things done as a team. I term I hear a lot is "vibes based management", which is a recognition that somebody (probably not engineering management!) is making these kinds of decisions and communicating them just well enough for line engineers to make good choices.</p><p>If you're looking for management advice because you're running a whole company, that kind of leadership is in scope! But if you're looking to learn how to be a good engineering manager, I'm not sure how much "leadership" has to do with doing a good job.

Yes, an EM should be empowering as many IC leaders as possible, but that can't be done if the EM does not recognize true leadership.  While it's theoretically possible to succeed as a manager leveraging others without having your own true tech lead chops, the majority of managers like this end up either putting too much trust in the wrong ICs or (worse) devolve into cover-your-ass "agile" process bullshit.

	<div>
<p>This cube manages to balance itself on a corner, and can simultaneously rotate around its axis in a controlled manner. It does so using clever controls and a set of three reaction wheels.</p>



<p>The original idea for this device comes from researchers at ETH Zürich, who demonstrate their “Cubli” in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_6p-1J551Y" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_6p-1J551Y">this video</a>. Its design has been improved in some ways in later years. Notably, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWEWNBDW6CM" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWEWNBDW6CM">Bobrow et al</a> (University of São Paolo) introduce an improved controls concept, reducing the number of required IMUs (inertial measurement units) to just one instead of six.</p>



<p>I decided to pursue the challenge of building one myself. Even though the idea isn’t new, previous works are largely closed-source. I plan to change that. This means that I had to reverse-engineer and draw everything from scratch. The result of my work, which is completely open source (<a href="https://github.com/willem-pennings/balancing-cube">GitHub</a>), is shown in the video below.</p>

<p>You might think: <strong>ANOTHER USELESS MACHINE?!</strong> When I published my <a href="https://willempennings.nl/mms-and-skittles-sorting-machine/" data-type="post" data-id="95">M&amp;Ms sorting machine</a>, I received lots of similar remarks. Indeed, it has no practical value, but similar applications such as sorting of fruits, vegetables and nuts based on colour do. For this cube, the situation is similar: while this is mostly a great learning experience and research project, reaction wheels are often used in satellites (such as the James Webb telescope) for attitude control purposes.</p>

<h2>Mechanical design</h2>



<p>The mechanical design of this cube is mostly the same as that of the original Cubli, but it has some subtle differences. The main structure consists of eight “cornerstones” and six face plates. Three of these face plates have additional features to support a motor and reaction wheel assembly. All parts were drawn in (con)Fusion 360. My student days are over, so I had to say farewell to Siemens NX. The latter isn’t used much (if at all?) in the DIY community anyway, so I can share my designs with others more easily now.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="680" height="768" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cad-assembly-mechanical.png" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cad-assembly-mechanical.png 680w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cad-assembly-mechanical-266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"></figure></div>


<p>Most structural parts are made of stainless steel for its excellent strength. The faceplates are made of aluminium to save weight. These don’t need to be made of steel since the assembled structure will be more than stiff enough when made of aluminium anyway.</p>



<p>All metal parts in this project have been manufactured by <a href="https://www.pcbway.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pcbway.com/">PCBWay</a>. I’ve used their PCB prototyping service before and was interested in their CNC capabilities. Part of the cost for these parts was sponsored by PCBWay. The ordering process was straightforward and I like that a quote was automatically calculated directly after uploading the part and specifying the material type. I’m satisfied with the parts and their quality: a small production issue was quickly resolved and all parts fit together without issue. Pictures below: judge for yourself.</p>



<p>I had fun with the design of the motor and flywheel assembly. I was looking for a robust design – after all, the wheels can reach speeds up to 6000 rounds per minute – while also keeping it lightweight. Even though I’m a mechanical engineer by education, construction principles aren’t my main strength, but after all that’s the reason for projects like these: to learn! I finally came up with the following.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>The motor is connected to a stainless steel bridge using three countersunk screws. The bridge eventually connects to one of the aluminium faceplates.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>A small hub is mounted onto the shaft of the motor and secured using three set screws. This hub is critical: if the center hole is not perpendicular with respect to the flat triangular face, the wheel will not be aligned with the motor shaft, causing vibrations and wear.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>A reaction wheel is mounted onto the hub using three countersunk screws. This step requires a bit of trial and error to correct for imperfections in the hub and wheel, which may cause the misalignments I mentioned earlier. I resolve these by placing tiny pieces of paper between the horizontal contact surface of the hub and wheel and this provides satisfactory results. After all, these parts aren’t taken apart very often.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>A small radial ball bearing is inserted into one of the faceplates and secured using cyanoacrylate (“super”) glue. This ball bearing will support one end of the motor shaft. The other end of the shaft is also supported by a bearing within the motor itself.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>Finally, the motor shaft is inserted into the bearing and the bridge is connected to the faceplate using four bolts. This process is repeated two more times.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>This result in half a cube. The remaining faceplates don’t require any special assembly steps and can be directly assembled. Notice how one of the motors is oriented differently with respect to the bridge to which it attaches? That is done on purpose: it simplifies the cabling work later on.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>The result is a strong yet relatively lightweight structure. The aluminium faceplates are relatively weak by themselves, but won’t budge when assembled together.</p>



<h2>Electromechanical design</h2>



<p>For the motor and motor controllers, other balancing cubes use Maxon motors from the “<a href="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/content/ec-flat-motors" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/content/ec-flat-motors">EC flat</a>” series. While it’s possible to find cheaper alternatives, the motors and their controllers are critical parts and I don’t want to skimp on them. The cube will balance by applying torques to the motors. Many DC motors do not even come with datasheets that specify the torque constant (which defines the relationship between torque and current), and many brushless motor controllers such as ESCs only offer speed control, but not current control. Both are essential in making this project a reality, so the choice for components of high quality is obvious here.</p>


<div>

<p>I selected a 60 W <a href="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/591477" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/591477">motor</a> and a compatible 4-quadrant <a href="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/control/4-Q-Servokontroller/466023" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/control/4-Q-Servokontroller/466023">motor controller</a> which can deliver currents up to 6 A. At 24 V, this corresponds to almost 150 W. While this is well beyond the nominal power rating of the motor, it is no problem to briefly overload the motor. Moreover, the controller has a built-in I2t algorithm which limits current to the motor if the winding temperature is estimated to become too high. It is unlikely that the cube hits these limits in normal operation anyway, because currents are generally very low while balancing.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="940" height="499" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/escon.png" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/escon.png 940w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/escon-300x159.png 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/escon-768x408.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></figure></div>


<p>The software that comes with the Escon motor controllers is pretty great. There are motor commissioning and tuning tools and a nice dashboard showing the status of the motor and its inputs/outputs during operation (shown in the screenshot above).</p>



<p>For the battery, I chose a 6S1P lithium-polymer battery. The motors are rated for 24 V so a six-cell LiPo battery (nominal voltage 22.2 V) is a good fit here. The battery has a capacity of 1300 mAh (29 Wh) which is enough to run the cube for at least an hour, normally.</p>


<div>

<p>The motherboard is a custom design and integrates the three motor controllers, IMU (hidden), ESP32-S3 development board, and some supporting components such as protection circuits and voltage regulators. The board also anticipates adding mechanical brakes to the cube, by providing outputs for RC servo motors. Mechanical brakes will enable the cube to jump up to the balancing position by itself. I haven’t finished the development of the brake design yet.</p>

<p>Assembling the circuit board was fun. I started by applying solder paste and placing the surface-mount parts. After reflowing it in a small toaster oven (more details about how this works <a href="https://willempennings.nl/miniature-3456-led-cube/" data-type="post" data-id="48">here</a>), I soldered all the through hole parts by hand.</p>

<p>Later, during integration and testing of the various components, I found that I had made a few small routing errors which I quickly corrected using bodge wires. It turns out that only one digital input on the motor controller supports PWM and I routed the PWM signal to another (unsupported) input.</p>



<p>I also designed a board to mount the battery onto. It’s much simpler: it has two XT60 connectors and two switches (wired in parallel because of currents up to 18 A) to turn the cube on and off.</p>



<h2>Controller design and tuning</h2>



<p>I didn’t actually design the controller the cube myself, but ported the <a href="https://github.com/fbobrow/cubli-firmware" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/fbobrow/cubli-firmware">work</a> by Fabio Bobrow from Arm Mbed to Arduino. I’m also using an ESP32 instead of an STM32 Nucleo. Nevertheless, rewriting the code was a good chunk of work. Also, since I’m using a different IMU (the ICM20948 by TDK Invensense), I had to rewrite the corresponding “driver”. I still spent quite some time studying the design of this controller and will spend a few words to highlight some nice things about it.</p>



<p>The design of the main attitude controller is most interesting. It is perhaps best explained as a negotation between two <em>contradictory </em>objectives. The first objective is to keep the cube in its desired orientation, that is, at its unstable equilibrium position. A second goal, however, is to keep the wheel velocities to a minimum. Not considering this second objective could lead to wheels speeds getting out of control, saturing the motors, and thereby effectively rendering it unable to exert torques on the cube.</p>



<p>The two objectives are in conflict: if the ‘desire’ to keep wheel velocities close to zero is too great, the cube simply falls over. Like mentioned before, if it is too weak, the wheels might literally spin out of control. The trick therefore is to find gains that result in good balancing performance and disturbance rejection while keeping wheel velocities somewhat low.</p>

<p>There is another elegant mechanism in the controller to deal with constant errors. What are constant errors? For example, there might be a small difference between the configured equilibrium position and the actual equilibrium due to imperfections in the weight distributions of the cube. In a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controller, the integral part deals with these kinds of errors. This controller uses the <em>position</em> (in degrees) of the wheel as the integral! In my opinion, this is actually a very intuitive way of visualizing an integral controller. When I modify the weight distribution of the cube (in the video: by placing a tomato on it), you can see the reaction wheels increase and then decrease in speed: they are moving to a new <em>position </em>to compensate for the increased error!</p>



<p>Commissioning and tuning the controller was, by far, the largest piece of code-related work. Like any experienced controls engineer, I spent a few days flipping the signs of various signals before I got them right. Then, I had to find the right gains for the controller. The tuning methodology as described in Bobrow’s <a href="https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/3/3139/tde-20102022-084937/publico/FabioBobrowCorr22.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/3/3139/tde-20102022-084937/publico/FabioBobrowCorr22.pdf">dissertation</a> didn’t work for me, so I resorted to tuning the gains by hand. Note that my cube uses different wheels compared to Bobrow’s cube, so reusing the gains was not possible. Using an iterative procedure, I finally obtained the gains that result in the stabilizing performance as shown in the video (which is very good, in my humble opinion).</p>

<p>That’s it! A balancing cube. It’s the only fully open-source cube in the world which achieves a balancing performance similar to that of Cubli, as far as I know. I hope that others will now also be inspired to build this cool device.</p>



<p>Here are some links to similar cubes which are at least somewhat documented (more than just a video or photo):</p>

</ul>



<h2>Next steps: jumping up</h2>



<p>I plan to add mechanical brakes to the reaction wheels. These will enable the wheels to be braked rapidly, resulting in much larger torques than the motors can deliver. This enables jump-up manoeuvers which in turn enable the cube to get to its equilibrium position on its own. This feature is currently unique to the original Cubli, as far as I know. I don’t particularly like the braking mechanism that Cubli uses for various reasons, so I’m going to use a different approach. I’ll share results in a future post!</p>

<p><strong><abbr title="Too long; didn't read.">TL;DR</abbr></strong> I always hesitated to deploy an extra tool for user management and <abbr title="Single Sign-On">SSO</abbr>, but the current state of the web makes it very difficult to keep up with security, CVEs etc. Why not trust one of the longest standing solutions for identity and access management? Keycloak is open source, interoperable with major SSO protocols (<code>OpenID Connect (OIDC), OAuth 2.0, SAML</code>), and robust. The setup with docker compose is not complicated, but it was not straight forward either. This is why I provide a summary of the process below. </p>
<div>
<p>Info</p>
<p>This is currently a stub. I thought I would share my <code>docker-compose.yml</code> and <code>nginx.conf</code> quickly and update the post later to add steps for theming and integration.</p>

<h2 id="concept">Concept<a href="#concept" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>You may have seen the concept below already in my <a href="https://du.nkel.dev/blog/2023-12-12_mastodon-docker-rootless/">previous post</a> about Mastodon. We will use a standard setup of nginx as a central reverse proxy that forwards traffic through localhost to individual services, all running in their own rootless docker namespaces. I consider this the typical economical setup, by sharing resources of a single host but with maximally isolated environments. Adapt where this does not fit your usecase.</p>

There are some example <code>docker-compose.yml</code>s available, such as <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> or <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We will start with a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> that directly uses <a href="https://quay.io/repository/keycloak/keycloak?tab=tags&amp;tag=latest">the official keycloak image</a>. This can be changed later.</p>

<summary>Some explanations for the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> above</summary>
<ul>
<li><code>'127.0.0.1:8080:8080'</code> and <code>KC_PROXY: edge</code> will make keycloak listen on localhost</li>
<li>the syntax for env variables (<code>${KC_HOSTNAME:-your.tld.com}</code>) means:<br>
  1. use <code>KC_HOSTNAME</code> from <code>.env</code>, if available;<br>
  2. otherwise substitute a default value (<code>your.tld.com</code>)  </li>
<li>note (e.g.) that we do not set <code>KC_DB_USERNAME</code>, which means: <em>use the default</em>  </li>
<li><code>image: quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:23.0.6</code> references a specific  image tag, as is     suggested for production (only use <code>:latest</code> for development).</li>
<li><code>KC_LOG_LEVEL: debug</code> can be commented out once we are done with development</li>
<li>bind-mount the persistent postgres data from the subfolder created earlier in the     user's home directory:
  <div><pre><span></span><code>services:
<span>  </span>postgres_db:
<span>    </span>image:<span> </span>postgres:16
<span>    </span>volumes:
<span>      </span>-<span> </span>/srv/keycloak/data/postgres16:/var/lib/postgresql/data
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>if you want to start over from scratch, simply delete this postgres folder and it     will be re-initialized on next startup:
  <div><pre><span></span><code>CTRL+D
sudo<span> </span>rm<span> </span>-rf<span> </span>/srv/keycloak/data/postgres16
sudo<span> </span>machinectl<span> </span>shell<span> </span>keycloak@
<span>cd</span><span> </span>~<span> </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> </span>mkdir<span> </span>-p<span> </span>data/postgres16
</code></pre></div></li>
<li><code>/srv/keycloak/data/postgres16</code> holds the persistent data that would need periodic     backups</li>
</ul>
</details>
<h2 id="test-locally">Test locally<a href="#test-locally" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>At this stage, we can test the docker compose stack:

</code></pre></div>
<p>Afterwards, create a reverse SSH tunnel to your VM and the keycloak local port.
</p><div><pre><span></span><code>ssh<span> </span>you@111.11.11.11<span> </span>-L<span> </span>:8080:127.0.0.1:8080<span> </span>-p<span> </span><span>22</span><span> </span>-N<span> </span>-v
</code></pre></div>
<p>Open <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code> in your browser and you should be greeted with the keycloak welcome screen:

<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>From here on, wherever you see <code>your.tld.com</code>: replace with your actual domain.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>At this stage, you should head to your domain registrar and add an <code>A</code> record to forward DNS queries to your VM's IP.</p>

I joined GitLab in October 2015, and left in December 2021 after working there
for a little more than six years.</p><p>While I previously wrote <a href="https://yorickpeterse.com/articles/im-leaving-gitlab-to-work-on-inko-full-time/">about leaving
GitLab</a> to work on
<a href="https://inko-lang.org/">Inko</a>, I never discussed what it was like working for
GitLab between 2015 and 2021. There are two reasons for this:</p><ol><li>I was suffering from burnout, and didn't have the energy to revisit the last
six years of my life (at that time)</li><li>I was still under an NDA for another 24 months, and I wasn't sure how much I
could discuss without violating it, even though it probably wouldn't have
caused any problems</li></ol><p>The NDA expired last December, and while I suspect I'm still dealing with the
fallout of a burnout, I have a bit more energy to revisit my time at GitLab.</p><p>I'll structure this article into two main sections: an overview of my time at
GitLab based on what I can still remember, and a collection of things I've
learned as a result of my work and experiences.</p><h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#before-gitlab">Before GitLab</a></li><li><a href="#2015-2017">2015-2017</a></li><li><a href="#2017-2018">2017-2018</a></li><li><a href="#2019-2021">2019-2021</a></li><li><a href="#what-ive-learned">What I've learned</a><ul><li><a href="#scalability-needs-to-be-part-of-a-companys-culture">Scalability needs to be part of a company's culture</a></li><li><a href="#make-teams-more-data-and-developer-driven">Make teams more data and developer driven</a></li><li><a href="#you-cant-determine-what-is-minimal-viable-without-data">You can't determine what is "minimal viable" without data</a></li><li><a href="#a-saas-and-self-hosting-dont-go-well-together">A SaaS and self-hosting don't go well together</a></li><li><a href="#more-people-doesnt-equal-better-results">More people doesn't equal better results</a></li><li><a href="#im-conflicted-on-the-use-of-ruby-on-rails">I'm conflicted on the use of Ruby on Rails</a></li><li><a href="#the-time-it-takes-to-deploy-code-is-vital-to-the-success-of-an-organization">The time it takes to deploy code is vital to the success of an organization</a></li><li><a href="#location-based-salaries-are-discriminatory">Location based salaries are discriminatory</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li></ul><h2 id="before-gitlab">Before GitLab</h2><p>Before joining GitLab, I was working for a small startup based in Amsterdam.
Like most startups, in the months leading up to my departure the company started
to run out of money and had to resort to some desperate solutions, such as
renting out part of the office space to cover the costs. At the same time, I
felt I had done all the things I wanted to and could do at a technical level.</p><p>In parallel to this, I was also working on
<a href="https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius">Rubinius</a> in my spare time, and we had
considered using it on various occasions, going as far as making sure all our
code ran on it without any problems. This also lead to the creation of
<a href="https://github.com/yorickpeterse/oga">Oga</a>, an XML/HTML parsing library acting
as an alternative to Nokogiri.</p><p>Unfortunately, the lack of funding combined with various technical problems
meant that we never pursued the use of Rubinius further. Because of all these
factors, I started looking for a job where I could spend at least some more time
working on Rubinius in hopes of making it stable enough for people to use in a
production environment.</p><p>During this time I attended various Ruby meetups in Amsterdam, and helped out
with a few <a href="https://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a> workshops. At one of these
workshops I ran into <a href="https://sytse.com/">Sytse</a> and his wife, and once again at
a later workshop or meetup (I think, I can't quite remember as it's been a long
time). Through this I learned about GitLab, and developed an interest in working
there.</p><p>Some time in the summer of 2015 I sent Sytse an Email, stating I wanted to work
for GitLab and asking if they were willing to sponsor me working on Rubinius one
day per week. The conversation and interviews that followed resulted in me
starting at GitLab in October 2015 as employee #28. My task was to improve
performance of GitLab, and allowed me to spend 20% of my time on Rubinius.</p><p>During my time I was a part of various teams, had a lot of autonomy, reported to
10 different managers over the years, nearly wiped the company out of existence,
built various critical components that GitLab still uses to this day, saw the
company grow from 30-something employees to around 2000 employees, and ended up
with a burnout. Or as the Dutch saying goes: "Lekker gewerkt, pik!" (good luck
translating that).</p><h2 id="2015-2017">2015-2017</h2><p>My last day at the company before GitLab was September 30, a Wednesday, followed
by starting at GitLab the next day. This meant I went from working in an office
five days per week to working remote five days per week. While I had worked from
home before, mainly when the trains weren't running due to a tiny amount of snow
or leaves on the tracks, it took a bit of adjusting to the new setup.</p><p>A particular memory from this time that stands out is carrying a bag of
groceries home during the day, and realizing how nice it's to do that during the
day instead of in the evening after coming home from work.</p><p>Another memory is taking a nap on my sofa with my cat, of which I took this
picture at the time:</p><p><img src="https://yorickpeterse.com/images/what-it-was-like-working-for-gitlab/sofa_cat.jpg?hash=ef15409a921d80eea3e9e7f853b1dafb410a0c14a003a1b1947aa7226453b5e1" alt="My cat judging me while I try to take a nap"></p><p>Yes, those are Homer Simpson slippers.</p><p>The apartment I was renting at the time wasn't large and only had a small
kitchen area, a small living room, and a similarly small attic. This meant that
my living room functioned as my bedroom, living room, and office all at once. It
wasn't a great setup, but it was all I could afford at the time. Perhaps the
expensive Aeron chair had something to do with it.</p><p>In spite of being an all remote company, GitLab was a social company, with
frequent meetups and events taking place over the years. For example, a few
weeks after I joined there was a company gathering in Amsterdam, involving
various activities during the day and dinners in the evening:</p><p><img src="https://yorickpeterse.com/images/what-it-was-like-working-for-gitlab/amsterdam_dinner.jpg?hash=69193a4e4fe87cea08b63f3712f42e53199b7cd2c894637b060abf312480a8f6" alt="A dinner with everybody at GitLab"></p><p>Back then you could still fit the entire company in one corner of a restaurant.</p><p>Not long after, GitLab had its first growth spurt, resulting in somewhere around
100 new employees (I think? My memories are a bit fuzzy at this point). At the
next company gathering in Austin in 2016, a single corner in a restaurant was no
longer enough:</p><p><img src="https://yorickpeterse.com/images/what-it-was-like-working-for-gitlab/austin_gathering.jpg?hash=5f2b4c1565a5b2ba96e1dbb174f96676b88a23d72d097a5eeef439eed79aed18" alt="The company gathering in Austin, Texas"></p><p>During this time there were also plenty of negative experiences. GitLab suffered
from terrible performance, frequent outages (almost every week some), poor
management, and many other problems that startups face. This lead to "GitLab is
slow" being the number one complaint voice by users. Especially on Hacker News
people just <em>loved</em> to complain about it, no matter what the original topic
(e.g. some new feature announcement) might've been. Of course GitLab was aware
of this, and in fact one of the reasons GitLab hired me was to resolve these
problems.</p><p>Resolving these problems proved a real challenge, in particular because GitLab
had no adequate performance monitoring infrastructure. That's not an
exaggeration by the way: the only service running at the time was a New Relic
trial account that only allowed monitoring of one, <em>maybe</em> two servers out of
the (I think) total of 15-20 servers we had at the time. This meant that
whatever data did come in wasn't an accurate representation, and made measuring
and solving performance a challenge.</p><p>What made solving these problems extra  difficult was GitLab's requirement that
whatever tooling we'd use had to be available to self-hosted customers, and
preferably be open source (or perhaps this was even a hard requirement, I can't
remember). This meant I had to not only improve performance, but also build the
tools to improve performance in the first place. At the same time, writing
performant code (or code that at least isn't horribly slow) wasn't at all
considered a priority for the rest of the company. GitLab also had a tendency to
listen more to complaints on Hacker News than internal complaints. This lead to
an internal running joke that it if you wanted something to change, you'd have
better luck complaining about it anonymously on Hacker News instead of bringing
it up through the proper channels.</p><p>What followed was several months of me trying to improve performance, build the
tooling necessary for this, try to change the company culture/attitude towards
performance such that things would actually improve over time, and deal with
GitLab not being happy with the improvements made. I distinctively remember
there being at least several video calls in which I was close to yelling at
Sytse, though it fortunately never came to that.</p><p>In spite of these challenges I did manage to build the necessary tooling, and
improve performance in various parts (some of which were significant, others not
so much). This tooling became an official GitLab feature known as <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/performance/">"GitLab
Performance Monitoring"</a>,
though it has changed quite a bit over the years. Another tool I built was
<a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/1749">"Sherlock"</a>, a
heavy-weight profiler meant to be used in a development environment.</p><p>During this time, GitLab started to realize you can't solve these sort of
problems by just hiring one person, especially if performance isn't a priority
for the rest of the company. One of the changes this lead to was that instead of
reporting directly to Sytse, I would report to a dedicated manager as part of
the new "Performance" team, and the team had a budget to hire more people. I
don't remember exactly what the budget was, but it wasn't much: two, <em>maybe</em>
three people I think. This wasn't nearly enough given the total size of the
company and it's primary focus being producing as many features as possible, but
it was a start.</p><p>Much of my second year I spent as part of this team, now with a bit more room to
breathe. I continued campaigning for more resources and making good performance
a requirement for new code, but with mixed results, and of course I and the team
as a whole continued improving performance.</p><p>During this time GitLab also saw its first wave of lay-offs and people leaving
by their own will, mainly as a result of GitLab hiring the wrong people in the
first place. This meant that GitLab grew from 30-something to (I think)
130-something people, only to shrink back to 80-something people, only to start
growing again in the months to come.</p><p>As for Rubinius: while we tried to get GitLab to work on Rubinius, we never
succeeded. Combined with the maintainer of Rubinius wanting to take the project
in a different direction and the controversies this lead to within the Ruby
community, we ultimately decided to give up on Rubinius, and I stopped working
on it entirely. It's unfortunate, as Rubinius had a lot going for it over the
years but was ultimately held back by the maintainers running the project in a
way different from what was necessary for it to become successful.</p><h2 id="2017-2018">2017-2018</h2><p><img src="https://yorickpeterse.com/images/what-it-was-like-working-for-gitlab/sytse_giraffe.jpg?hash=06741c66e9a3d93163aa8ab8e653c9a89e85549f13d0e8150b947577f560d74a" alt="South Africa summit in 2018"></p><p>After the first rocky 1,5 years, things started to improve. Performance had
improved greatly, and GitLab was starting to take it more seriously. Hiring
processes were much improved, and like a game of chess GitLab started moving the
right people into the right places. The scope of the performance team also
changed: instead of focusing on performance in general, the team would focus on
database performance and as part of this was to be renamed to the creatively
called "Database team". With this change also came a bigger budget for hiring
people, and infrastructure engineers assigned to help us out with e.g. setting
up new databases.</p><p>A critically important feature I built during this time is <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/postgresql/database_load_balancing.html">GitLab's database
load balancer</a>
(<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/10/02/scaling-the-gitlab-database/">announced here</a>).
This feature allowed developers to continue to write their database queries as
usual, while the load balancer would take care of not directing these queries to
either a replica or a primary. After performing a write, the load balancer
ensures the primary database is used until the written changes are available to
all replicas, an act commonly referred to as "sticking". The introduction of the
load balancer had a significant and positive impact on performance, and I'm
certain GitLab would've been in a lot of trouble if it wasn't for this load
balancer. What I'm most proud of is being able to introduce this system
transparently. To date I've not seen a database load balancer (let alone for
Ruby on Rails) that you can just add to your project and you're good to go.
Instead, existing solutions are more like frameworks that only provide a small
piece of the puzzle, requiring you to glue everything together yourself, often
without any form of sticking support. It's a shame we never got to extract it to
a standalone library.</p><p>This period wasn't just one of incredible productivity and improvements, it also
marked the lowest and scariest moment of my time at GitLab and my career as a
whole: on January 31st, after a long and stressful day of dealing with many
issues that continued well into the late evening, I <del>solved GitLab's performance
problems</del> <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/02/01/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/">removed GitLab's production database by
accident</a>.
This then lead to the discovery that we didn't have any backups as a result of
the system not working for a long time, as well as the system meant to notify us
of any backup errors not working either. In the end we did recover, as I had
copied the production data to our staging environment about six hours prior as
part of of the work I was doing that day, though the recovery process took
around 24 hours. While about six hours of data loss is by all accounts terrible,
I'm not sure what would've happened if I hadn't made that backup. Suffice to
say, my heart skipped a few beats that day, and I'm certain I instantly grew a
few extra grey hairs.</p><p>A recurring source of frustration during this time was GitLab's desire to shard
the database, even after the introduction of the database load balancer. Not
only did I and the other engineers and my manager believe this to be the wrong
solution to our problems, we also had the data to back this up. For example,
sharding is useful if writes heavily outnumber reads, but in case of GitLab
reads dominated writes by a ratio along the lines of 10:1. Further, the amount
of data we were storing wasn't nearly enough to justify the complexity of
introducing sharding. I distinctively remember a consultant we'd hired saying
something along the lines of "No offence, but we have customers with several
orders of magnitudes more load and storage, and even for them sharding is
overkill". In spite of this, GitLab would continue to push for this over the
years, until management made the decision to leave it be, only for GitLab to
bring it up <em>again</em> (just using a slightly different name and idea this time)
towards the end of my time at GitLab.</p><h2 id="2019-2021">2019-2021</h2><p><img src="https://yorickpeterse.com/images/what-it-was-like-working-for-gitlab/new_orleans.jpg?hash=804a9dbb2eba8868a70c4a72029890487cfc847ee7e8bf9f234ec0155f885b71" alt="New Orleans summit in 2019"></p><p>Some time in 2018-2019 I transitioned from the database team into a newly
founded "Delivery" team, as I had grown tired of working on performance and
reliability for the last four years. Furthermore, multiple people were now
working on performance and reliability, so I felt it was the right time
for me to move on to something new. The goal of this new team was to improve the
release process and tooling of GitLab, as the state of this was at the time best
described as messy.</p><p>For example, we looked into how much time there was between a commit landing in
the main branch and deploying the change GitLab.com. The resulting data showed
that on average it would take several days, but in the worst cases it could take
up to <em>three weeks</em>. The main bottleneck here was the split between GitLab
Community Edition and GitLab Enterprise Edition, both existing as separate Git
repositories, requiring manual merges and conflict resolution on a regular
basis. This lead to a multi-month effort to <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/02/21/merging-ce-and-ee-codebases/">merge the two projects into
one</a>.
While we divided the work into frontend and backend work, and made various teams
responsible for contributing their share towards the effort, I ended up
implementing most of the backend related changes, with another colleague taking
care of most of the frontend work.</p><p>Together with the rest of the team we made significant improvements to the
release process during this period, and we reached a point where we could deploy
changes in a matter of hours. While this is nowhere near as quick as it
should've been, going from a worst-case of three weeks to a worst-case of
<em>maybe</em> a day is a <em>massive</em> improvement.</p><p>Like the previous periods, this period was not free of turmoil and changes.</p><p>2018 was the last year we had a GitLab summit focused on employees, with 2019
and following years following a format more like a traditional conference, aimed
more at customers and less at employees. From a financial perspective this was
understandable as organizing a gathering of 2000+ people is incredibly
expensive. From a social perspective it was a loss, as the more corporate
setting of the summits wasn't nearly as fun as the old format. I have fond
memories of <a href="https://youtu.be/39chczWRKws?feature=shared&amp;t=1751">Sytse dancing on stage in response to a team winning a
contest</a>, or Sytse and his
wife giving a fitness class while Sytse is wearing a giraffe costume. These sort
of goofy events wouldn't happen any more in the following years.</p><p>Then there was the issue of laptop management: people would request a company
Mac laptop and were more or less free to use it how they saw fit, or you'd use
your own hardware like me. Over the years GitLab's management started
discussions about using software to be able to remotely manage the laptops. A
recurring problem in these discussions was that the proposed tools were invasive
(e.g. they could be used to record user activity), didn't contain any guarantees
against abuse, and feedback from employees (of which there was <em>a lot</em>) would be
ignored until key employees started applying pressure on management. The plans
would then be shelved, only for the discussion to start all over again months
later.</p><p>What stood out the most was not the proposed changes, but rather the way
management handled the feedback, and how the changes in general gave off a vibe
of solutions in search of problems to justify their existence. It's worth
mentioning that most people involved in these discussions (myself included)
understood the need for some form of laptop management (e.g. against theft), but
felt that the invasive solutions proposed went too far.</p><p>GitLab did settle on a laptop management solution using
<a href="https://nl.sentinelone.com/">SentinelOne</a>. While GitLab made it a requirement
for employees to install this software on hardware used to access GitLab
resources, including your personal hardware (or at least was considering
requiring that), I (using my own desktop computer) somehow managed to stay under
the radar and was never asked to install the software in question. Perhaps
because I wasn't using a company issued laptop, GitLab just forgot to check up
on me.</p><p>These cultural changes combined with various changes in my personal life
resulted in a loss of motivation, productivity, and an increase in stress, and
less consistent working hours. The team's manager (whom I'd consider the best
manager I've ever had) also transitioned to a different role, with a newly hired
manager now leading the team. I didn't get along well with this manager,The
resulting conflict lead to a "performance enablement plan", a procedure meant to
get things back on track before the need for a "performance improvement plan"
(PIP). A PIP is meant to be used as a last attempt at improving the relationship
between an employee, their work, and their employer.</p><p>What rubbed me the wrong way was how GitLab handled the PEP: I acknowledged
there were areas I needed to improve upon, but I felt that part of the problem
was the new manager's way of working. Management assured me that the PEP meant
to improve the state of things on both ends, i.e. it wouldn't just focus on <em>me</em>
improving but also the manager. That didn't happen, and the PEP focused solely
on what <em>I</em> needed to do differently. The PEP was also a bit vague about what
requirements had to be met. The original plan was for the PEP to last one month,
but by the end of the first month my manager decided to extend the PEP by
another month because they felt this to be necessary, the reasons for which
weren't well specified. I decided to just go along with it, and after two months
passed I completed the PEP and management deemed the results satisfactory.</p><p>The optimist in me likes to believe I was just the first employee to be put on a
PEP and thus management had to figure things out as we went along. The pessimist
in me has a far more negative opinion on this series of events, but I'll keep
that to myself.</p><p>After this experience I realized that perhaps it was time for me to leave, as
both GitLab and I were heading in different directions, and I was unhappy with
the state of things at the time.</p><p>The opportunity for this presented itself towards the end of 2021: GitLab was
going public, and taking into account the time I had to wait before I could
exercise my stock options meant I'd be able to leave in December 2021. I
couldn't leave earlier due to how stock option taxes worked in The Netherlands
at the time: exercising stock options meant having to pay full income taxes
(52%) over the difference between the exercise fee and valuation, even if the
stock isn't liquid. In my case the amount of taxes would be so high I wouldn't
be able to afford it, forcing me to wait until GitLab went public. A few months
later the law changed, and you can now choose to pay the taxes either at the
time of exercise, or when the stock is liquid. The caveat is that if you defer
taxes until the stock is liquid, you pay taxes based on the value at that time,
not based on the value at the time of exercising your stock options. This
certainly isn't ideal and presents a huge financial risk, but at least you have
a choice.</p><p>And so with my stocks acquired, I left in December 2021 to work on
<a href="https://inko-lang.org/">Inko</a> full-time, using my savings to cover my bills.</p><h2 id="what-ive-learned">What I've learned</h2><p>With the history out of the way, let's take a look at some things I've learned
from my time at GitLab. One thing to keep in mind is that I'm basing these
findings on my personal experiences, and as such it's not unlikely I'm wrong in
some areas.</p><h3 id="scalability-needs-to-be-part-of-a-companys-culture">Scalability needs to be part of a company's culture</h3><p>A mistake GitLab made, and continued to make when I left, was not caring enough
about scalability. Yes, directors would say it was important and improvements
were certainly made, but it was never as much of a priority as other goals. At
the heart of this problem lies the way GitLab makes money: it primarily earns
money from customers self-hosting GitLab Enterprise Edition, not GitLab.com. In
fact, GitLab.com always cost <em>much</em> more money than it brought in. This
naturally results in a focus on the self-hosted market, and many of the
performance problems we ran into on GitLab.com didn't apply to many self-hosted
customers.</p><p>What was even more frustrating was that many developers in fact <em>wanted</em> to
improve performance, but weren't given the time and resources to do so.</p><h3 id="make-teams-more-data-and-developer-driven">Make teams more data and developer driven</h3><p>Another factor is GitLab's product manager driven nature. While some key
developers may have had the ability to influence product decisions (given enough
screaming and kicking), it was mainly product managers and directors deciding
what needed to be implemented. Sometimes these decisions made a lot of sense,
other times they seemed to be based solely on the equivalent of "I read on
Hacker News this is a good idea, so we have to build it".</p><p>I believe GitLab would've been able to perform better as a company if it adopted
a simpler hierarchy early on, instead of the traditional multi-layer hierarchy
it has today. In particular, I think the idea of product managers needs to go in
favour of giving team leads more power and having them interact more with users.
To me, that's ultimately what a "product manager" should do: help build the
product at a technical level, but also act as a liaison between the team and its
users.</p><h3 id="you-cant-determine-what-is-minimal-viable-without-data">You can't determine what is "minimal viable" without data</h3><p>One of GitLab's core principles is to always start with a "minimal viable
change". The idea is to deliver the smallest possible unit of work that delivers
value to the user. On paper that sounds great, but in practice the definition of
"minimal" is inconsistent between people. The result is that one team might
consider performance or good usability a requirement to something being viable,
while another team couldn't care less.</p><p>In practice this lead to GitLab building many features over the years that just
weren't useful: a serverless platform nobody asked for and that was ultimately
killed off, support for managing Kubernetes clusters that didn't work for three
weeks without anybody noticing, a chatops solution we had to build on top of our
CI offering (thus introducing significant latency) instead of using existing
solutions, or a requirements management feature that only supported creating and
viewing data (not even updating or deleting); these are just a few examples from
recent years.</p><p>To determine what makes something viable, you need a deep understanding of the
desires of your target audience. While GitLab does perform <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/performance-indicators/paid-nps/">user surveys every
quarter</a>,
and some teams have access to data about user engagement, from what I remember
and learned from talking to other former colleagues it seems this data was more
incidentally used, instead of being a core part of each team's workflow.</p><h3 id="a-saas-and-self-hosting-dont-go-well-together">A SaaS and self-hosting don't go well together</h3><p>GitLab offers two types of product: self-hosted installations and a software as
a service (SaaS) offering. I believe most companies won't be able to effectively
offer such a setup, including GitLab. Not only do you get a conflict of interest
based on what earns you the most money (as mentioned above), but the two types
of setups also come with different requirements and ways of applying updates.</p><p>For example, for a SaaS you want to be able to deploy quickly and have to
handle large amounts of data and workloads taking place on a centralized
infrastructure. Given most self-hosted instances tend  to be tiny in comparison
to the SaaS offering, many of the solutions for the problems you encounter as a
SaaS and their corresponding solutions just don't apply to self-hosted
installations. This effectively results in two code paths in many parts of your
platform: one for the SaaS version, and one for the self-hosted version. Even if
the code is physically the same (i.e. you provide some sort of easy to use
wrapper for self-hosted installations), you still need to think about the
differences.</p><p>In contrast, when you focus on <em>either</em> a SaaS or self-hosted setup you get to
dedicate all your attention to providing the best experience for the setup in
question. There are of course exceptions, but they are exactly that: exceptions,
and exceptions are rare.</p><h3 id="more-people-doesnt-equal-better-results">More people doesn't equal better results</h3><p>Like many other companies before it, GitLab hired large numbers of people over
the years and today employs over 2000 people. I don't know how many of those are
developers today, but I'm guessing at least a few hundred based on a quick
glance at their team page.</p><p>It's well known that adding more people to a project doesn't necessarily improve
productivity and results (see also "The Mythical Man-Month"), and yet almost
every western startup with venture capital seems to ignores this, hiring
hundreds of developers even if the product doesn't need nearly that many
developers.</p><p>I don't have any data to back this up, but I suspect that most companies don't
need more than 20 developers, with some needing 20 to 50 developers, and only a
handful needing between 50 and 100 developers. Once you cross the 100 developer
mark, I think you need to start thinking about whether the scope of your
product(s) isn't getting out of hand before hiring even more people.</p><p>Note that I'm specifically talking about software developers here. For example,
if you're building custom hardware, you'll probably need more people to scale up
the production process. Sales and support are also two areas where you generally
do benefit from having more people, as these types of work require less
synchronisation between people.</p><h3 id="im-conflicted-on-the-use-of-ruby-on-rails">I'm conflicted on the use of Ruby on Rails</h3><p>GitLab is built using Ruby and Ruby on Rails, and this is a big part of what
allowed it to reach the success it enjoys today. At the same time, this
combination presents its challenges when the project reaches a large size with
many contributors of different experience levels. Rails in particular makes it
too easy to introduce code that doesn't perform well.</p><p>For example, if you want to display a list of projects along with a counter
showing the number of project members, it's far too easy to introduce the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/97197/what-is-the-n1-selects-problem-in-orm-object-relational-mapping">N+1
query problem</a>
by accident. While Rails (or more specifically, ActiveRecord) provides
functionality to solve this, it's an opt-in mechanism, inevitably leading to
developers forgetting about this. Many of the performance problems solved during
my first few years at GitLab were N+1 query problems.</p><p>Other frameworks have learned from this over the years and provide better
alternatives. The usual approach is that instead of being able to arbitrarily
query associated data, you have to pass in the data ahead of time. The benefit
here is that if you were to forget passing the data in, you'd run into some sort
of error rather than the code querying the data for you on a per-row basis,
introducing performance problems along the way.</p><p>Ruby itself is also a choice I have mixed opinions on. On one end, it's an
wonderful language I enjoyed using for a little under 10 years. On the other
end, it's heavy use of meta programming makes it difficult to use in large
projects, even with the introduction of optional typing. I'm not just saying
that for the sake of saying it, I experienced it first hand when writing <a href="https://github.com/yorickpeterse/ruby-lint">a
static analysis tool for Ruby</a> years
ago.</p><p>In spite of all this, I'm not sure what alternative I would recommend instead of
the combination of Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Languages such as Go, Rust or Node.js
might be more efficient than Ruby, but none have a framework as capable as Ruby
on Rails. Python and Django <em>might</em> be an option, but I suspect you'll run into
similar problems as Ruby and Ruby on Rails, at least to some degree. It would
probably help if new web frameworks stopped obsessing over how to define your
routing tree, and instead focused more on productivity as a whole.</p><p>I have some vague ideas on how I'd approach this with
<a href="https://inko-lang.org/">Inko</a>, but there's a lot of other work that needs doing
before I can start writing a web framework in Inko.</p><h3 id="the-time-it-takes-to-deploy-code-is-vital-to-the-success-of-an-organization">The time it takes to deploy code is vital to the success of an organization</h3><p>This is something I already knew before joining GitLab, having spent a
significant amount of time setting up good deployment and testing pipelines at
my previous job, but working for GitLab reinforced this belief: you need to be
able to deploy your code <em>fast</em>, i.e. within at most an hour of pushing the
changes to whatever branch/tag/thing you deploy from. At GitLab it took
somewhere around four years for us to get even close to that, and we still had a
long way to go.</p><p>Apart from the obvious benefits, such as being able to respond to incidents more
efficiently (without having to hot-patch code to account for your deploys taking
hours), there's also a motivational benefit: being able to see your changes live
is <em>nice</em> because you actually get to see and make use of your work. Nothing is
more demotivating than spending weeks on a set of changes, only for it to take
another two weeks for them to be deployed.</p><p>For this to work, you need to be incredibly aggressive about cutting down deploy
times and the time it takes to run your test suite as part of your deployments.
Depending on the type of application and the types of services you're testing,
you may inherently need a certain amount of time to run the tests. The point
here is not "tests and deployments must never take more than X minutes", but
rather to (as an organization) make it a priority to be able to deploy as fast
as your business requirements allow you to. As obvious as this may seem, I
suspect many organizations aren't doing nearly as good of a job in this area as
they could.</p><h3 id="location-based-salaries-are-discriminatory">Location based salaries are discriminatory</h3><p>The salary you earn at GitLab is influenced by various variables, one of which
is location. The influence of your location isn't insignificant either. When you
are a company with a physical office and have a need to hire people in specific
areas, it might make sense to adjust pay based on location as you otherwise
might not be able to hire the necessary people in the required areas. But for an
all remote company without a physical office, and legal entities across the
whole world, there's no legitimate reason to pay two different people with the
same experience and responsibilities different salaries purely based on where
they live.</p><p>To illustrate: when I left GitLab my salary was around €120 000 per year, or
around €8500 per month, before taxes. For The Netherlands this is a good salary,
and you'll have a hard time finding companies that offer better <em>and</em> let you
work from home full time. But if I had instead lived in the Bay Area, I would've
earned at least twice that amount, possibly even more. Not because I am somehow
able to do my job better in the Bay Area, or because of any other valid
reason for that matter, but because I would be living in the Bay Area instead of
in The Netherlands.</p><p>No matter how you try to spin this, it's by all accounts an act of
discrimination to pay one person less than another purely based on where they
live. Think about it: if a company pays a person less because of the color of
their skin or their gender, the company would be in big trouble. But somehow
it's OK to pay a person less based on their location?</p><p>As for how to solve this, for companies it's easy: just pay based on the
position's requirements, not the location of the applicant. It doesn't matter
whether you're paying somebody in the Bay Area $100 000 per year, or somebody in
the Philippines, because the cost for you as a business is the same. For
employees my only advice is to try and negotiate a better salary, but this may
prove difficult as companies paying based on locations also tend to be stubborn
about it. I hope one day our laws catch up with this practice.</p><p>A company that seems to do a good job at this is the <a href="https://oxide.computer/">0xide Computer
Company</a>. Instead of paying employees based on their
location, 0xide pays employees the same amount (see <a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values">this
post</a> for
more details), something I deeply admire and believe more companies should do.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Looking back, my time at GitLab is a mix of both incredibly positive and
negative experiences. I'm incredibly proud of the achievements the various teams
I was on made, and the people I got to work with, but I'm also saddened by the
last year or so souring an otherwise great experience. I don't have any regrets
working for GitLab, and would do it all over again if I could, just a little
differently thanks to the benefit of hindsight. I also still recommend it as a
company to work for, because in spite of its flaws I think it does <em>much</em> better
than many other companies.</p></section></div>]]></description>

<p>Last year, a new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623022503">study</a> on green innovations and patents in 27 countries left one reader slack-jawed. The findings were no surprise. What was baffling was how the authors, two professors of economics in Europe, had pulled off the research in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reader, a PhD student in economics, was working with the same data described in the paper. He knew they were riddled with holes – sometimes big ones: For several countries, observations for some of the variables the study tracked were completely absent. The authors made no mention of how they dealt with this problem. On the contrary, they wrote they had “balanced panel data,” which in economic parlance means a dataset with no gaps.</p>



<p>“I was dumbstruck for a week,” said the student, who requested anonymity for fear of harming his career. (His identity is known to Retraction Watch.)</p>



<p>The student wrote a polite email to the paper’s first author, <a href="https://ju.se/en/personinfo?sign=hesalm&amp;lang=en">Almas Heshmati</a>, a professor of economics at Jönköping University in Sweden, asking how he dealt with the missing data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In email correspondence seen by Retraction Watch and a follow-up Zoom call, Heshmati told the student he had used Excel’s autofill function to mend the data. He had marked anywhere from two to four observations before or after the missing values and dragged the selected cells down or up, depending on the case. The program then filled in the blanks. If the new numbers turned negative, Heshmati replaced them with the last positive value Excel had spit out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The student was shocked. Replacing missing observations with substitute values – an operation known in statistics as imputation – is a common but <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030440761500278X?via%3Dihub">controversial</a> technique in economics that allows certain types of analyses to be carried out on incomplete data. Researchers have established methods for the practice; each comes with its own drawbacks that affect how the results are interpreted. As far as the student knew, Excel’s autofill function was not among these methods, especially not when applied in a haphazard way without clear justification.</p>



<p>But it got worse. Heshmati’s data, which the student convinced him to share, showed that in several instances where there were no observations to use for the autofill operation, the professor had taken the values from an adjacent country in the spreadsheet. New Zealand’s data had been copied from the Netherlands, for example, and the United States’ data from the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This way, Heshmati had filled in thousands of empty cells in the dataset – well over one in 10 – including missing values for the study’s outcome variables. A table listing descriptive statistics for the study’s 25 variables referred to “783 observations” of each variable, but did not mention that many of these “observations” were in fact imputations.</p>



<p>“This fellow, he imputed everything,” the student said. “He is a professor, he should know that if you do so much imputation then your data will be entirely fabricated.”</p>



<p>Other experts echoed the student’s concerns when told of the Excel operations underlying the paper.</p>



<p>“That sounds rather horrendous,” said Andrew Harvey, a professor of econometrics at the University of Cambridge, in England. “If you fill in lots of data points in this way it will invalidate a lot of the statistics and associated tests. There are ways of dealing with these problems correctly but they do require some effort.</p>



<p>“Interpolating data is bad practice but lots of people do it and it’s not dishonest so long as it’s mentioned,” Harvey added. “The other point about copying data from one country to another sounds much worse.”</p>



<p>Søren Johansen, an econometrician and professor emeritus at the University of Copenhagen, in Denmark, characterized what Heshmati did as “cheating.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The reason it’s cheating isn’t that he’s done it, but that he hasn’t written it down,” Johansen said. “It’s pretty egregious.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, “Green innovations and patents in OECD countries,” was published in the <em>Journal of Cleaner Production</em>, a <a href="https://journalpublishingguide.vu.nl/WebQuery/vubrowser/498">highly ranked</a> title from Elsevier. It has been cited just once, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science.</p>



<p>Neither the publisher nor the journal’s editors, whom the student said he alerted to his concerns, have responded to our requests for comment.</p>



<p>Heshmati’s coauthor, Mike Tsionas, a professor of economics at Lancaster University in the UK, <a href="https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/intranet/news/article/mike-tsionas">died recently</a>. In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ifabs_remembering-professor-mike-tsionas-a-activity-7150834577173872640-iGW4">a eulogy posted on LinkedIn</a> in January, the International Finance and Banking Society hailed Tsionas as “a true luminary in the field of econometrics.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Almas-interview-full-Gmail-journalist-inquiry.pdf">a series of emails</a> to Retraction Watch, Heshmati, who, according to the paper, was responsible for data curation, first said Tsionas had been aware of how Heshmati dealt with the missing data.</p>



<p>“If we do not use imputation, such data is almost useless,” Heshmati said. He added that the description of the data in the paper as “balanced” referred to “the final data” – that is, the mended dataset.</p>



<p>Referring to the imputation, Heshmati wrote in a subsequent email:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Of course, the procedure must be acknowledged and explained. I have missed to explain the imputation procedure in the data section unintentionally in the writing stage of the paper. I am fully responsible for imputations and missing to acknowledge it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added that when he was approached by the PhD student:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I offered him a zoom meeting to explain to him the procedure and even gave him the data. If I had other intensions [sic] and did not believe in my imputation approach, I would not share the data with him. If I had to start over again, I would have managed the data in the same way as the alternative would mean dropping several countries and years.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>G<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/25/torturing-data-to-predict-bitcoin-prices-a-book-excerpt/">ary Smith</a>, a professor of economics at Pomona College in Claremont, California, said the copying of data between countries was “beyond concerning.” He reviewed Heshmati’s spreadsheet for Retraction Watch and found five cases where more than two dozen data points had been copied from one country to another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marco Hafner, a senior economist at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit think tank, said “using the autofill function may not be the best of ideas in the first place as I can imagine it is not directly evident to what conditions missing values have been determined/imputed.”</p>



<p>Hafner, who is research leader at RAND Europe, added that “under reasonable assumptions and if it’s really necessary for analytical reasons, one could fill in data gaps for one country with data from another country.” But, he said, the impact of those assumptions would need to be reported in a sensitivity analysis – something Heshmati said he had not done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At the bare minimum,” Hafner said, the paper should have stated the assumptions underlying the imputation and how it was done – something that, he added, would have reduced the chances of the work getting published should the reviewers find the methods inappropriate.</p>

Tomlinson, a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>-based science fiction author who says he has been swatted dozens of times in the past four years as part of a targeted <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/harassment">harassment</a> campaign by a group of “sociopathic” stalkers.</p><p>“You can’t fathom the amount of clinical obsession that grips these people,” Mr Tomlinson told <em>The Independent </em>this week. “Trying to destroy my world is their full time lives.”</p><figure><figcaption><p>Patrick S.

A new Telegram channel named “Torswats Return” was created by someone claiming that their “partner has been arrested”, according to posts viewed by <em>The Independent.</em></p><p>The channel stated that it would continue offering “swats” for as little as $40, and offered returning customers a discounted rate.

That’s why it’s so dangerous, that’s why it’s attempted murder.”</p><p>Mr Tomlinson wants to see repeat swatters charged with attempted murder and terrorism.</p><p>“You’re not dealing with internet trolls here, these are hardened criminals,” he told<em> The Independent.</em></p><p>“You have to treat it like a domestic terror cell, they get off on creating chaos and trying to harm people. And in order to keep chasing that high they are only going to escalate.”</p><p><h2><strong>The most swatted man in America</strong></h2></p><p>Mr Tomlinson, who dabbles in stand-up comedy, came to the attention of a hardcore group of online stalkers five and a half years ago after posting an innocuous tweet about the late <em>Saturday Night Live </em>comedian Norm Macdonald.</p><p>“Hot take: I’ve never found Norm Macdonald funny and was pretty sure all my comedy friends who did were either nuts or screwing with me,” he posted on 11 September 2018.</p><p>Days later, Mr Tomlinson was locked out of his verified Twitter account @stealthygeek. He later discovered a 30,000-strong Reddit group of fans of the former shock jock radio show <em>Opie and Anthony</em> had mass reported him for breaching community standards.</p><p><em>Opie and Anthony </em><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/opie-anthony-host-anthony-cumia-fired-after-racist-twitter-tirade-185021/"><u>was canned</u></a> by SiriusXM in 2014 after the network said co-host Anthony Cumia made “racially-charged and hate-filled remarks” on Twitter. Fans of the show later coalesced on the internet around a shared enjoyment of posting hateful content attacking the LGBTQ community, their supporters and any left-wing commentators they took a dislike to.</p><figure><figcaption><p>Author Patrick S. Tomlinson has been relentlessly stalked and harassed for years </p><p> (Courtesy of Patrick S. Tomlinson)</p></figcaption></figure><p>Mr Tomlinson told <em>The Independent </em>his accounts on YouTube, Instagram and Facebook were targeted over the next few months with false complaints.</p><p>He said the trolls created Twitter accounts impersonating him, which he says posted racist, homophobic abuse in an attempt to discredit him.</p><p>The Reddit group also posted photoshopped images of Mr Tomlinson and doxxed his home address and phone number.</p><p>The harassment quickly escalated to death threats left on Mr Tomlinson’s voicemail. Mr Tomlinson said the stalkers began following him to science fiction conventions where they would secretly photograph him and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/1567952066064285696"><u>post the images online</u></a>, and contacted his book publishers claiming they had kidnapped his wife.</p><p>In June 2019, one of the stalkers paid MacDonald <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTMBNcPSfbU"><u>to record a Cameo</u></a> in which the comedian, who died in 2021, says he was told that someone named Patrick had said he wasn’t funny. He then calls on “Patrick’s friends” to “please continue insulting that fat loser.”</p><p>The video appears to have encouraged the stalkers to ramp up their efforts.</p><p>In May 2020, Mr Tomlinson’s home was swatted for the first time when two police officers turned up “ready to go” at his home late one night demanding to know where “the children” were.</p><p>The swat came soon after stalkers had created a bogus Craigslist advert with Mr Tomlinson’s home address bizarrely <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boogie2988/comments/174pi0s/psa_please_keep_your_black_children_away_from/"><u>claiming</u></a> that he was kidnapping African-American children, and “grinding them down to make pepperoni”. </p><p>The twisted claim has echoes of the “pizzagate” conspiracy theory, which claimed that Democratic Party insiders were keeping child sex slaves in a pizza parlour in Washington DC.</p><p>The coordinated campaign continued to escalate. The harassers <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/32921860"><u>flooded book sale sites</u></a> Amazon and Goodreads with bogus one star reviews of Mr Tomlinson’s publications in a coordinated assault.</p><p>After the<em> Opie and Anthony</em> subreddit was removed in 2019 for repeated breaches of its terms of service, the harassers migrated to the website new.onaforums.net where the campaign of torment continued.</p><p>The site’s message boards have attracted more than 40,000 threads and around one million comments dedicated to what Mr Tomlinson describes as their “total, clinical obsession with my every tweet, thought, public appearance”.</p><figure><figcaption><p>Milwaukee Police Department police officers have been called out to hoax threats at the home of Patrick S.

In another cruel move, the group also posted <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMOtHizStiE&amp;t=1s"><u>audio on YouTube of Mr Tomlinson</u></a> screaming in frustration as he is being swatted.</p><p>Mr Tomlinson reported the group’s obsessive harassment to police and the FBI in May 2020. He said a special agent from the Milwaukee field office was assigned to look into the case, but that he has heard little back about their investigation.</p><p>“The FBI is a black hole as far as their investigation is concerned,” he told <em>The Independent. </em>“We throw evidence down the hole, and nothing comes out.”</p><p>Mr Tomlinson said he has reported each swat to the Milwaukee PD and the FBI, and personally gone to his local precinct on several occasions to ask that they stop sending armed police to his home “every time our stalkers tell them to”.</p><figure><figcaption><p>After Alan Filion’s arrest, the Torswats Telegram channel is back advertising ‘swats’ for as little as $40 </p><p> (Screenshot)</p></figcaption></figure><p>In a response to <em>The Independent</em>, The Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) declined to address why it hasn’t put measures in place to recognise serial swatting attacks at Mr Tomlinson’s home, instead just sharing the same statement it has given other outlets.</p><p>“Swatting is unacceptable, illegal and potentially very dangerous behavior, as it can lead to a very dynamic situation, placing both the residents involved and our officers at risk,” an MPD spokesperson said. </p><p>“Out of an abundance of caution, MPD has a duty to respond to calls for service in order to ensure that no one is in danger and that the necessary precautions are taken into consideration during these incidents.”</p><p>Mr Tomlinson’s attempt to involve law enforcement only seemed to embolden his stalkers, who doubled down on the campaign of emotional torment.</p><p>At 1am on 25 July 2022, the MPD responded to a hoax 911 call by someone claiming to be Mr Tomlinson saying he had killed his wife and a man in their bed. Mr Tomlinson said he was in bed asleep and woke up to hear pounding on his door, and officers armed with assault rifles surrounding his home.</p><p>Security footage taken by his home cameras shows him handcuffed on the porch while the MPD searched his home.</p><p>Mr Tomlinson may be the main target but the stalkers also harass those around him. The same month, while attending her grandfather’s funeral, Mr Tomlinson’s wife discovered she had been impersonated by someone who sent racist emails to Black influencer Marvin Toliver.</p><p>She was temporarily suspended from work before being cleared of any involvement in sending the hateful messages. Mr Toliver later <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CgQOUWXDDcU"><u>posted a video to Instagram</u></a> explaining that the racist messages he’d received were a hoax.</p><p>Mr Tomlinson’s elderly parents have also been swatted three times, he said.</p><figure><figcaption><p>A dedicated ‘swatting’ channel on Telegram has made explicit threats and derogatory posts about author Patrick S.

Six downtown city blocks were shut down for hours while bomb-sniffing dogs checked buildings.</p><p>Mr Tomlinson told <em>The Independent</em> that MPD officers stopped by his home that night to tell him that the bomb threat had come from stalkers using his name, one of more than half a dozen such hoax bomb threats he had been accused of.</p><p>In April 2023, he was swatted four times in one day. The fourth time the MPD sent six officers with assault rifles to his home at 9pm.</p><p>His home has since been swatted a further 20 times, the most recent being just last week.</p><p>Mr Tomlinson has <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/1567957109978849282"><u>documented the years of harassment</u></a> on Twitter, now X, with the posts often enraging the stalkers and drawing dozens of abusive responses.</p><p>He first spoke at length about the harassment to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/internet-trolls-have-tormented-patrick-tomlinson-for-years-and-he-cant-stop-them"><u><em>the Daily Beast</em></u></a> in October 2022, and has given interviews to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-science-fiction-writer-victim-of-swatting/40912738"><u>local</u></a> and <a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=44681X1458326&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Ftech%2Ffbi-formed-national-database-track-004042096.html&amp;sref=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/swatting-nikki-haley-trump-fbi-stalkers-b2494097.html"><u>national media</u></a> in the hope it might deter the stalkers, but each time it only seemed to spur them on.</p><p>Mr Tomlinson also <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://webapps.sftc.org/ci/CaseInfo.dll?SessionID=30CDAC0FED5343082DB67C4BACB8CC240542A495&amp;URL=https%3A%2F%2Fimgquery.sftc.org%2FSha1_newApp%2Fmainpage.aspx%3FWeb_Server%3Dimgquery.sftc.org%26MINDS_Server%3Dhoj-imx-01%26Category%3DC%26DocID%3D07662612%26Timestamp%3D20240202112224%26Digest%3Dacee2c5a847c8cbf820acdd7a4bf83ab602a4392"><u>filed a lawsuit in 2020</u></a> to try to force the internet service provider Cloudflare to reveal the names of the individuals behind the website.</p><p>The request to subpoena Cloudflare was denied by the Superior Court of California after a judge ruled it fell under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields blogs and social media sites from problematic content on their platforms posted by third parties.</p><p>A judge also ordered Mr Tomlinson to pay the anonymous blogger behind the website $23,700 in legal fees.</p><p>That figure has ballooned to $50,000 with interest and penalties, and Mr Tomlinson said the group behind the blog was trying to bankrupt him and take his house.</p><p>Mr Tomlinson has refused to cave despite the ongoing threats to his life, and he and his wife suffering from PTSD and chronic insomnia.</p><p>Rather than relocating or going into hiding, he said he had invested in a top-of-the line security system and bought a “small arsenal of weapons” to protect himself.</p><p>“I bought my wife a gun for Christmas, just so she could feel more at ease.”</p><p><h2><strong>‘Nobody would ever dare swat himself, right?’</strong></h2></p><p>Court documents from Mr Filion’s arrest this week provided a rare glimpse into the dark web nexus between an underground network of professional “swatters” and the criminal stalkers who hire them.</p><p>According to a charging document, the Torswats Telegram channel first came onto the law enforcement’s radar in October 2022, when Anacortes High School in Skagit County, Washington was <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.goskagit.com/anacortes/news/anacortes-high-schools-disrupted-by-phone-threats/article_b1bee9b8-4eeb-11ed-ab37-cba9f380ce4c.html"><u>targeted five times in a week</u></a> with hoax bomb threats and shooting callouts.</p><p>Police initially believed a 17-year-old student at the school was behind the swats, before concluding that he had also been a victim of swatting attempts. The Telegram channel that authorities have tied to Mr Filion later posted audio of the 911 calls.</p><p>Over a month-long period, Torswats posted recordings of fake 911 bomb threats at schools and non-profit organisations in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Texas, Maryland and Iowa.</p><p>In one swatting incident in February 2023, a teenager in Dubuque, Iowa, who had been in contact with Torswats <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.kcrg.com/2023/03/06/high-school-student-charged-with-making-threats-toward-dubuque-hempstead/"><u>was arrested</u></a> for ordering a bomb threat at a local high school.</p><p>In April 2023, <em>Motherboard </em><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7z8be/torswats-computer-generated-ai-voice-swatting"><u>revealed for the first time</u></a> how the Torswats Telegram channel was offering to swat victims using a synthesized speech programme for a $75 fee.</p><p>The next month, Torswats posted audio of a swatting at the Masjid Al Hayy Mosque in Sanford, Florida.</p><p>The caller allegedly told a dispatch operator that he had a handgun and explosive devices and was going to kill everyone inside “in the name of Satan” while playing audio of gunfire.</p><p>Around 30 heavily armed police officers were sent to the mosque, Seminole County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.</p><p>The Torswats Telegram channel was also filled with screeds of racist, misogynistic, transphobic and anti-LGBTQ postings, according to prosecutors.</p><p>In one post, Mr Filion allegedly wrote that he “sent police to the homes of people I don’t like (f… and transsexuals) for fun”, according to a charging document.</p><p>“While a number of victims targeted by Torswats were the product of conducting a swatting’ service, there is an obvious trend observed in the subject’s targeting and his own words, in which victims are chosen due to their sexual orientation and identity, race or religion,” detectives from the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office wrote.</p><p>In May 2023, the FBI set up a national database to “track and create a real-time picture of swatting incidents” and share information between hundreds of police departments and law enforcement agencies across the country.</p><figure><figcaption><p>Judge Arthur Engoron, who presided over a civil fraud trial against the Trump Organisation, was swatted in January </p><p> (POOL/AFP via Getty Images)</p></figcaption></figure><p>In late June, Scott Schubert, the section chief of the FBI Criminal Justice Services Division, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-formed-national-database-track-prevent-swatting-rcna91722"><u>gave an interview</u></a> to <em>NBC News</em> about a new swatting national database that would enable law enforcement to monitor the growing threat.</p><p>In the following days, Mr Schubert, and the FBI special agents in charge in Pittsburgh, San Antonio and Oklahoma City were targeted in swatting calls.</p><p>An FBI spokesperson told <em>The Independent</em> that more than 550 swatting incidents have been reported to the database, known as the National Common Operation Picture, in the past seven months.</p><p>Experts say that figure could be just the tip of the iceberg, as police departments are often reluctant to report swats due to the embarrassment of being duped.</p><p>“That the FBI is starting to take this seriously and get some data, is a useful thing,” Professor Singer, the cybersecurity expert, told <em>The Independent.</em></p><p>“It helps you identify underlying systemic behaviours that might indicate a larger problem.”</p><p>Swatters are typically prosecuted under state False Information and Hoaxes laws.</p><p>But without a federal statute, law enforcement are constrained from devoting additional resources to training 911 dispatchers or investigating cases, Professor Singer said.</p><p>Meanwhile, “swatters” are sharing information and learning from one anothers’ tactics to stay one step ahead of authorities, Professor Singer said.</p><p>He called for more sophisticated IT systems in police call centres to identify the location of where the phone call is coming from, and mandatory reporting of swats.</p><p>“People seem willing to do things online that they would never do in real life. And this is an illustration of where that kind of online harassment mentality can lead. It’s never been good, but now it’s actually dangerous,” Professor Singer said.</p><p>“It used to be spamming, it used to be doxxing, it used to be pizza orders — swatting is a much more destructive evolution of online harassment.”</p><p>The FBI alleges that in order to learn his trade, Torswats placed nine swatting calls to his own home in Andale Avenue, Lancaster, over a three month period between September and December 2022 to test what the police response would be.</p><p>The suspect allegedly boasted about calling out the swats on Telegram: “How would I know my methods would work otherwise. Swatting my neighbor means I’m in suspicion. But nobody would ever dare swat himself, right?”</p><p>His listed home address is in a quiet residential neighbourhood, across the street from a daycare centre.</p><p>Mr Filion would frequently post content from JRR Tolkien’s<em> Lord of the Rings</em> on Telegram, Google, Discord and YouTube. He allegedly used the handles “Witch King of Angmar” and variations of the word “Ringwraith” to call in swatting incidents, and posted images of Nazgul to Telegram.</p><p>The LOTR references left investigators with a trail of clues that led FBI agents to his parent’s home in Lancaster, Los Angeles County, in July that year.</p><p>They interviewed Mr Filion in the presence of his father William and seized phones and computer equipment. A search of the devices located screenshots and images posted to the Torswats Telegram channel, Google map searches of some of the targets, and emails between Mr Filion and cryptocurrency companies Crypto.com, CoinGate and CoinPayments.</p><p>A person who answered William Filion’s phone hung up when contacted by <em>The Independent.</em></p><p><h2><strong>‘If you hire a hitman, you’re just as guilty of murder’</strong></h2></p><p>Mr Tomlinson says the swatting attacks against him stopped suddenly in July last year, right around the time of the FBI raid on the Filion home.</p><p>Then the day after Thanksgiving, Mr Tomlinson said his home was swatted again for the first time in months. He <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/1739705532833767459"><u>captured screenshots</u></a> from a Torswats Telegram channel advertising that it would “resume normal operations” on Christmas. Mr Tomlinson’s <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/stealthygeek/status/1739706297681940804"><u>home was then targeted again on Christmas morning</u></a>.</p><p>The same day, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/crime/boston-mayor-swatted-christmas-wu-b2469990.html"><u>swatters called in hoax threats</u></a> to the homes of GOP House member <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/marjorie-taylor-greene">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. Florida Senator <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/rick-scott">Rick Scott</a>’s home in Naples was swatted on 27 December <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/SenRickScott/status/1740355797190934542?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1740355797190934542%7Ctwgr%5E5797051c0bd7d458af31f8c70fc07a1887da0649%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wptv.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitical%2Fsen-rick-scott-says-naples-home-was-swatted-while-at-dinner-with-his-wife"><u>while he was having dinner</u></a> with his wife.</p><p>Mr Filion was arrested on 18 January, and extradited to Seminole County, Florida, where he was charged with four felonies related to making a false police report of a mass shooting at a local mosque in May 2023. His arrest was first reported by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/story/alan-filion-torswats-swatting-arrest/"><u><em>Wired</em></u></a>.</p><p>His attorney did not respond to <em>The Independent’s </em>multiple requests for comment.</p><p>Mr Filion <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/crime/swatting-alan-filion-seminole-county-florida-b2488949.html"><u>made his first appearance</u></a> in court on 31 January and is being charged as an adult on four felony counts including false reporting of a bomb or weapon of mass destruction, and use of a two-way communication device while involved in an act of terrorism. Both are punishable by decades in prison.</p><p>Mr Tomlinson told <em>The Independent</em> he hopes the arrest will allow police to work out who was paying Mr Filion and who else is behind Torswats. Investigators stated in court documents that they had traced a Discord account to a “privacy friendly ‘virtual private network’ in Sweden”.</p><p>Mr Tomlinson says the stalkers who ordered the swats should be just as liable as the person phoning them in.</p><p>“If you hire a hitman, you’re just as guilty of murder.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

          -=[ Demoscene &amp; Video Game Music Streaming Radio Links ]=-

-=[ Introduction ]=-

On this web page I have compiled all of the demoscene and video game music
streaming radio station links that I know of.  I have been collecting these
stations for over ten years and the list has grown and shrunk over those
years.

Each radio station linked below starts with the link to the home page for the
station.  This is usually then followed by links to playlists (.m3u, .pls) that
when clicked will launch the station in you default player.  Then you will find
links to the stream (sometimes ending in .mp3, .acc, .ogg, .opus or a ;) that
will play in your web browser when clicked.  There will be repeats of playlists
and stream links when there are multiple different channels of music or multiple
different speed streams to choose from.  In some cases there are links, that
when clicked, will bring you to the SHOUTcast or Icecast server for the station.
Try clicking on links there to start the station playing.  If you have 
difficulty playing a stream, try to go to the station's home page and try to
play the streams from there.  Please do not be annoyed if some of the stations
do not work, I recently verified all of them, and they do go up and down on
a regular basis.  Give a station a try another day if it is not working now.

If you have any corrections or additions, please let me know in an email and I
will consider including them on this page.  My email address can be found by
going to my contact Michael Walden page at: <a href="https://mw.rat.bz/contact.htm">https://mw.rat.bz/contact.htm</a> .

The links on this list are not in any particular order, they are mostly in the
order that I became aware of them (oldest first, newest at the end).

Note: You may want to check out my Desktop Streaming Radio Players page at
      <a href="https://mw.rat.bz/players/">https://mw.rat.bz/players/</a> to get a player program for these streams.
      You can set one of them up to be your default streaming radio player.

There are currently about 60 stations on this list.

From this point on this page, to the end, I provide links to sites that were
used to collect stations to put on this list.  I will use these links in the
future to collect more new stations.  I went through all of these sites just
before publishing this page (around 2024-02-08).  There is no point in
looking at any of these links, to find new stations, any time in the near
future.  I would wait at least a year before going through the effort of
identifying any new stations on these sites.
