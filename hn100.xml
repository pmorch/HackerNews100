<p>Criminal suspects can refuse to provide phone passcodes to police under the US Constitution's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, according to a unanimous <a href="https://legacy.utcourts.gov/opinions/supopin/State%20v.%20Valdez20231214.pdf">ruling issued today</a> by Utah's state Supreme Court. The questions addressed in the ruling could eventually be taken up by the US Supreme Court, whether through review of this case or a similar one.</p>
<p>The case involves Alfonso Valdez, who was arrested for kidnapping and assaulting his ex-girlfriend. Police officers obtained a search warrant for the contents of Valdez's phone but couldn't crack his passcode.</p>
<p>Valdez refused to provide his passcode to a police detective. At his trial, the state "elicited testimony from the detective about Valdez's refusal to provide his passcode when asked," today's ruling said. "And during closing arguments, the State argued in rebuttal that Valdez's refusal and the resulting lack of evidence from his cell phone undermined the veracity of one of his defenses. The jury convicted Valdez."</p>
<p>A court of appeals reversed the conviction, agreeing "with Valdez that he had a right under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to refuse to provide his passcode, and that the State violated that right when it used his refusal against him at trial." The Utah Supreme Court affirmed the court of appeals ruling.<br>
                                            </p>
                                                        
<h2>Case possibly ripe for Supreme Court review</h2>
<p>The ruling offered some commentary on the developing legal questions about device passcodes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The prevalence of passcodes that encrypt the information on electronic devices—which are often seized by law enforcement while investigating criminal conduct—has raised important questions about how the Fifth Amendment extends to law enforcement's efforts to unlock these devices and decrypt the contents inside. These questions have proven to be especially complex where law enforcement attempts to access the contents of a seized device by means that do not require the suspect to disclose the actual passcode—like, for example, obtaining an order to compel the suspect to provide an unlocked device.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Valdez case does not involve an order to compel a suspect to unlock a device. Instead, "law enforcement asked Valdez to verbally provide his passcode," Utah justices wrote. "While these circumstances involve modern technology in a scenario that the Supreme Court has not yet addressed, we conclude that these facts present a more straightforward question that is answered by settled Fifth Amendment principles."</p>
<p>Ruling against the state, the Utah Supreme Court said it "agree[s] with the court of appeals that verbally providing a cell phone passcode is a testimonial communication under the Fifth Amendment."</p>
<p>Berkeley Law Professor Orin Kerr <a href="https://reason.com/volokh/2023/12/14/is-compelled-decryption-heading-to-the-supreme-court/">wrote today</a> that the case could head to the US Supreme Court. "One of the major issues in the law of digital evidence investigations is how the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applies to unlocking phones," Kerr wrote.</p>
<p>So far, "the lower court case law is a total mess," according to Kerr. "No one can say what the law is. And I've been waiting for a case to come down that might be a good candidate for US Supreme Court review to clear up the mess."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>A little over three years have passed since McDonald's sent out an email to thousands of its restaurant owners around the world that abruptly cut short the future of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/they-hacked-mcdonalds-ice-cream-makers-started-cold-war/">a three-person startup called Kytch</a>—and with it, perhaps one of McDonald's best chances for fixing its famously out-of-order ice cream machines.</p><p>Until then, Kytch had been selling McDonald's restaurant owners a popular internet-connected gadget designed to attach to their notoriously fragile and often broken soft-serve McFlurry dispensers, manufactured by McDonalds equipment partner Taylor. The Kytch device would essentially hack into the ice cream machine's internals, monitor its operations, and send diagnostic data over the internet to an owner or manager to help keep it running. But despite Kytch's efforts to solve the Golden Arches’ intractable ice cream problems, a McDonald’s email in November 2020 warned its franchisees not to use Kytch, stating that it represented a safety hazard for staff. Kytch says its sales dried up practically overnight.</p><p>Now, after years of litigation, the ice-cream-hacking entrepreneurs have unearthed evidence that they say shows that Taylor, the soft-serve machine maker, helped engineer McDonald's Kytch-killing email—kneecapping the startup not because of any safety concern, but in a coordinated effort to undermine a potential competitor. And Taylor's alleged order, as Kytch now describes it, came all the way from the top.</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><p><span><picture><img alt="Image may contain: Food, Creme, Dessert, and Cream" src="https://media.wired.com/photos/6077243240d7cfe5e259427c/master/w_775%2Cc_limit/web_hp_IceCream_15046_2.jpg" srcset="https://media.wired.com/photos/6077243240d7cfe5e259427c/master/w_120,c_limit/web_hp_IceCream_15046_2.jpg 120w, https://media.wired.com/photos/6077243240d7cfe5e259427c/master/w_240,c_limit/web_hp_IceCream_15046_2.jpg 240w, https://media.wired.com/photos/6077243240d7cfe5e259427c/master/w_320,c_limit/web_hp_IceCream_15046_2.jpg 320w, https://media.wired.com/photos/6077243240d7cfe5e259427c/master/w_640,c_limit/web_hp_IceCream_15046_2.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"></picture></span></p><div><p>Secret codes. Legal threats. Betrayal. How one couple built a device to fix McDonald’s notoriously broken soft-serve machines—and how the fast-food giant froze them out.</p></div></div><p>On Wednesday, Kytch filed a newly unredacted motion for summary adjudication in its lawsuit against Taylor for alleged trade libel, tortious interference, and other claims. The new motion, which replaces a redacted version from August, refers to internal emails Taylor released in the discovery phase of the lawsuit, which were quietly unsealed over the summer. The motion focuses in particular on one email from Timothy FitzGerald, the CEO of Taylor parent company Middleby, that appears to suggest that either Middleby or McDonald's send a communication to McDonald's franchise owners to dissuade them from using Kytch's device.</p><p>“Not sure if there is anything we can do to slow up the franchise community on the other solution,” FitzGerald wrote on October 17, 2020. “Not sure what communication from either McD or Midd can or will go out.”</p><p>In their legal filing, the Kytch cofounders, of course, interpret “the other solution” to mean their product. In fact, FitzGerald's message was sent in an email thread that included Middleby's then COO, David Brewer, who had wondered earlier whether Middleby could instead acquire Kytch. Another Middleby executive responded to FitzGerald on October 17 to write that Taylor and McDonald’s had already met the previous day to discuss sending out a message to franchisees about McDonald’s lack of support for Kytch.</p><p>But Jeremy O'Sullivan, a Kytch cofounder, claims—and Kytch argues in its legal motion—that FitzGerald’s email nonetheless proves Taylor's intent to hamstring a potential rival. “It's the smoking gun,” O'Sullivan says of the email. “He's plotting our demise.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Although FitzGerald's email doesn't actually order anyone to act against Kytch, the company’s motion argues that Taylor played a key role in what happened next. It's an “ambiguous yet direct message to his underlings,” argues Melissa Nelson, Kytch's other cofounder. “It's just like a mafia boss giving coded instructions to his team to whack someone."</p><p>On November 2, 2020, a little over two weeks after FitzGerald's open-ended suggestion that perhaps a “communication” from McDonald's or Middleby to franchisees could “slow up” adoption of “the other solution,” McDonald's <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mcdonalds-ice-cream-machine-hacking-kytch-taylor-internal-emails/">sent out its email blast</a> cautioning restaurant owners not to use Kytch's product.</p><p>The email stated that the Kytch gadget “allows complete access to all aspects of the equipment’s controller and confidential data”—meaning Taylor’s and McDonald’s data, not the restaurant owners’ data; that it “creates a potential very serious safety risk for the crew or technician attempting to clean or repair the machine"; and finally, that it could cause “serious human injury.” The email concluded with a warning in italics and bold: “McDonald’s strongly recommends that you remove the Kytch device from all machines and discontinue use.”</p><p>Kytch has long argued that McDonald’s safety warning was bogus: In its legal complaint, it noted that its devices received certification from Underwriters Laboratory, an independent product safety nonprofit, including meeting its safety standards. It also countered in the complaint any claim that a Kytch device's remote connection to an ice cream machine could result in the machine turning on while a person's hand was inside—in fact, Taylor's own manual advises unplugging the machine before servicing it, and removing the door of the machine to access its rotating barrels automatically disables its motor.</p><p>Kytch's legal motion now argues that FitzGerald's email reveals that the McDonald's warning to restaurant owners was never really about safety, so much as protecting its equipment partner from a startup that might represent competition. The CEO's email “essentially put into place their plan to defame us," Nelson says.</p><p>She and O’Sullivan also argue that the internal email directly contradicts FitzGerald’s public statements that Middleby hadn’t sought to kill Kytch. “We’re not in business to put other companies out of business,” FitzGerald <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/12/business/mcdonald-kytch-ice-cream-lawsuit.html">told <em>The New York Times</em></a> early last year.</p><p>When WIRED reached out to Middleby, Taylor’s parent company, for comment, a spokesperson responded in a statement disputing Kytch’s interpretation of its internal emails. “McDonald’s decided to issue the November 2020 field brief on its own accord, not at Middleby or Taylor’s direction,” the statement reads. “Taylor stood, and continues to stand, by the accuracy of statements made in the field brief.” The spokesperson also notes that Taylor won an early ruling in the lawsuit against Kytch’s request for a preliminary injunction—which would have prevented Taylor from developing a device that Kytch claims was <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mcdonalds-ice-cream-machine-hacking-kytch-taylor-internal-emails/">copied from its product</a>—and promises an upcoming filing responding to Kytch’s argument, which court documents say will happen in early 2024.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>At the time of McDonald's warning email to franchisees about Kytch, Taylor was developing its own internet-connected ice cream machine, what it referred to as Taylor Shake/Sundae Connectivity, which McDonald's recommended in the same email. But, even now, more than two years after it was promised for delivery, that device has yet to arrive in restaurants—and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/mcdonalds-ice-cream-machine-teardown-shows-error-codes-dmca-keep-it-broken/">publicly documented ice cream headaches</a> at McDonald’s appear to have continued. According to the website <a data-offer-url="https://mcbroken.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://mcbroken.com/&quot;}" href="https://mcbroken.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">McBroken</a>, which tracks ice cream machine downtime at McDonald's restaurants across the US, between 13 percent and 17 percent of McDonald's restaurants have had broken ice cream machines at any given time just this month. That percentage has recently been as high as 35 percent in New York City and 28 percent in Washington, DC.</p><p>Taylor declined to comment on any upcoming internet-connected ice cream machine model. But that long-touted solution to the problem has still not been made available to franchisees, according to one McDonald's restaurant owner who goes by the handle McFranchisee (and previously used the handle McD Truth) on X. But McFranchisee says that Taylor has integrated those new features into its next model, which is expected to be available in four to six months. (McFranchisee has also criticized Kytch, claiming that the startup's failure was due to its own reliability problems and an increase in its prices, not a Taylor or McDonald's conspiracy against them.)</p><p>Despite the email from Middleby's CEO that Kytch claims suggests dissuading franchisees from using Kytch's product, Kytch argues that <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mcdonalds-ice-cream-machine-hacking-kytch-taylor-internal-emails/">other documents released in the lawsuit’s discovery phase</a> show McDonald's itself was also eager to stymie Kytch from the beginning. In February 2020, Taylor president Jeremy Dobrowolski wrote in another email that “McDonald's is all hot and heavy about” Kytch's growing use in restaurants. Before the company sent out its November 2 email warning franchisees about Kytch, Taylor and McDonald’s executives had a meeting to discuss the message, and a McDonald's exec also sent a draft to Taylor for its approval. A Taylor executive wrote to others within the ice cream machine company, “I am a bit in shock they are willing to take such a strong position.”</p><p>When WIRED reached out to McDonald’s for comment on Kytch’s new argument about the “smoking gun” email from Taylor’s CEO, a spokesperson responded with a statement: “McDonald’s won’t speculate about the intent behind this email discussion that we weren't a part of. The intent of our Nov. 2020 communication was to bring awareness to potential safety concerns regarding the unapproved Kytch device.”</p><p>In addition to its lawsuit against Taylor, Kytch is still pursuing a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/kytch-ice-cream-machine-hackers-sue-mcdonalds-900-million/">bigger lawsuit against McDonald's itself</a>, asking for $900 million in damages for what it describes in its legal complaint as McDonald’s effort to “<a data-offer-url="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63127533/1/kytch-inc-v-mcdonalds-corporation/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63127533/1/kytch-inc-v-mcdonalds-corporation/&quot;}" href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63127533/1/kytch-inc-v-mcdonalds-corporation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">drive Kytch out of the marketplace</a>.” That lawsuit against McDonald's, if it moves forward, may soon produce more answers explaining Kytch’s legal claims that McDonald's appears to have cooperated with Taylor in telling its customers not to use Kytch—even as many of its restaurants took a significant hit from lost ice cream sales.</p><p>In the meantime, Kytch says it plans, if necessary, to take the lawsuit against Taylor to trial, currently set to take place in May at Alameda County Superior Court in Oakland, California. “The conspiracy described in Kytch’s complaint involved folks at the highest levels of leadership, not just at Taylor but also at Middleby and at McDonald’s,” says Daniel Watkins, Kytch’s attorney. “We’re really looking forward to the opportunity to present it to an Oakland jury trial.”</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

        <h2 id="reverse-engineering-bluetooth-le-led-light-controllers-or-how-i-bricked-my-christmas-lights">Reverse engineering Bluetooth LE LED light controllers, or How I Bricked My Christmas Lights</h2>

<p>If a device communicates via Bluetooth LE and has an app, it deserves to be integrated into my home automation system.</p>

<p>I’ve spent a significant amount of time reverse engineering various budget-friendly LED light strips to automate them. The process is generally repetitive, but I find it enjoyable. Recently, I successfully connected the cheapest lights I’ve ever come across — a £2.38 Bluetooth LE-controlled 5M non-addressable strip — to Home Assistant in just a few hours. You can buy some <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005485885067.html">here</a> and the code is <a href="https://github.com/8none1/bj_led">here</a>.</p>

<p>There is also the LEDnetWF controller I did the reverse engineering for <a href="https://github.com/raulgbcr/lednetwf_ble">here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.whizzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ha.jpg" alt="AliExpress Lights"></p>

<p>I also had another set of addressable lights on my desk. While decorating my office for Christmas, I decided to invest some time in connecting them to Home Assistant using the BJ_LED code as a template. It should have been straightforward, right? Well, yes, but also no.</p>

<p>These lights consist of a 10M long string of addressable LEDs controlled by the “iDeal LED” app. The app is feature-rich and works reasonably well. The LEDs are likely WS2812 or similar. I was quite pleased with these lights, which you can <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004829475855.html">find on AliExpress</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.whizzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/aliex_lights.jpg" alt="AliExpress Lights"></p>

<p>Now, let me share a cautionary tale. While I’m omitting some details for brevity, there are no secrets here, and additional instructions are readily available online. I understand this might feel a bit like <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl">drawing the rest of the owl</a> but the provided links should serve as a starting point for anyone interested in reverse engineering their own LED lights.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-the-bytes-over-the-wire">Step 1. The bytes over the wire</h2>

<p>To control devices from your own software, the first step is to examine the bytes sent over Bluetooth to the device from the app. Typically, lights use a simple protocol with a header, command bytes (for actions like turning on/off, changing color), and a footer, which might be a checksum.</p>

<p>Android makes this process easy. Enable developer mode on your Android device, install the app for your lights, and enable <code>Bluetooth HCI snoop</code> in the developer settings. This logs Bluetooth bytes to a file readable by <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>. Perform actions in the app, such as turning the lights on and off, and use <code>adb</code> to copy the logs to your computer.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>adb pull sdcard/btsnoop_hci.log .
</code></pre>

<p>Open the log in Wireshark to see the exact bytes sent to the device. Look for patterns in the values, and you’ll likely identify a series of bytes for each action, with one byte alternating between two values (e.g. <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> for <code>on</code> and <code>off</code>). Here’s a useful Wireshark filter:</p>

<pre><code>bluetooth.dst == ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff &amp;&amp; btatt.opcode.method==0x12
</code></pre>

<p>Change MAC address to be the MAC of your lights.  <code>btatt.opcode.method==0x12</code> is a write from the Android device to the lights.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you are now a reverse engineer!</p>

<p>Pro-tip:  You can speed things up a bit by using <a href="https://tshark.dev/">tshark</a> instead of Wireshark.  What you really care about is the values being written to the LED controller.  <code>tshark -r &lt;filename&gt; -T fields -e btatt.value</code> will dump the payload to the terminal for easy interrogation.</p>

<p>Sometimes your bytes will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>69 96 02 01 01
69 96 02 01 00
69 96 02 01 01
69 96 02 01 00
69 96 02 01 01
69 96 02 01 00
69 96 02 01 01
69 96 02 01 00
</code></pre>

<p>On, off, on, off, on, off, on, off.</p>

<p>Sometimes your bytes will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>84 dd 50 42 37 41 50 89 7a c8 2f 39 11 09 68 a8
79 d1 db a4 09 19 c2 46 a8 58 0a e7 d1 1b 78 84
84 dd 50 42 37 41 50 89 7a c8 2f 39 11 09 68 a8
79 d1 db a4 09 19 c2 46 a8 58 0a e7 d1 1b 78 84
84 dd 50 42 37 41 50 89 7a c8 2f 39 11 09 68 a8
79 d1 db a4 09 19 c2 46 a8 58 0a e7 d1 1b 78 84
84 dd 50 42 37 41 50 89 7a c8 2f 39 11 09 68 a8
</code></pre>

<p>There is still a repeating pattern here.  There are two distinct sets of bytes, one for on &amp; one for off, but… what?  Why is it so noisy?
Who designs their protocol like this?
The answer is: someone who is trying to hide something.</p>

<h2 id="step-2--replay-attacks">Step 2.  Replay attacks</h2>

<p>If your goal is simply turning the lights on and off, the repeating series of bytes you observed might be sufficient for power control. Test this with <code>gatttool</code>, which lets you connect to a BLE device and send bytes. You’ll need to know the handle to send bytes to, which you can find using Wireshark.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.whizzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wireshark.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>For more control, understanding all those bytes is essential. Let’s go to the source…</p>

<h2 id="step-3-decompile-the-android-app">Step 3. Decompile the Android app</h2>

<p>Download the app’s APK and open it in <a href="https://github.com/skylot/jadx">jadx</a>. Witness the secrets within!</p>

<p>In my case, I noticed references to AES in the source, indicating a potentially encrypted protocol. If the data is encrypted, some assumptions can be made:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The encrypted data doesn’t change every time, suggesting a consistent key.</li>
  <li>The data needs quick decryption on a low-power MCU, favouring shorter keys.</li>
  <li>The key is likely not unique to each device, making a fixed key plausible.</li>
</ul>

<p>The source code contained a compiled AES library <code>libAES.so</code>, which <code>jadx</code> can’t help me with.</p>

<p>This is where I got stuck.  For about 5 minutes.</p>

<p>I asked <a href="https://ubuntu.social/@popey">@popey</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sil">@sil</a> for some ideas.  @sil Googled some of the decompiled app code and found <a href="https://habr-com.translate.goog/ru/articles/722412/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&amp;_x_tr_hist=true">this</a> page.  On closer examination the code looks identical.  This chap used <a href="https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/">ida free</a> to decompile the AES library and found the key embedded in it.  Let’s try that key.</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES

key = [
    0x34, 0x52, 0x2A, 0x5B, 0x7A, 0x6E, 0x49, 0x2C,
    0x08, 0x09, 0x0A, 0x9D, 0x8D, 0x2A, 0x23, 0xF8
]

def decrypt_aes_ecb(ciphertext, key):
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB)
    plaintext = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)
    return plaintext
</code></pre>

<p>When we try and decrypt the <code>on</code> and <code>off</code> packets we get:</p>

<pre><code>05 54 55 52 4E 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
05 54 55 52 4E 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
05 54 55 52 4E 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
05 54 55 52 4E 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
05 54 55 52 4E 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
05 54 55 52 4E 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
</code></pre>

<p>Success!  This is a lot more sensible.  A fixed header, byte 5 switching between a <code>1</code> and a <code>0</code> for on and off, and a bunch of zeros.</p>

<p>We can now decrypt all the packets being sent to the device and we can encrypt our own bytes so that we can duplicate the controls from the Android app in our own code.  It’s pretty much mission accomplished at this point.</p>

<h2 id="step-4-all-the-functions">Step 4. All the functions</h2>

<p>Now, work through each app function, recording the bytes sent. Write down each action, do it multiple times, and use separators like turning the lights on and off. This helps spot patterns and correlate notes with captured bytes.</p>

<p>For example, your process might be:</p>

<pre><code>turn off, turn on - [start of function]
set to red
set to green
set to blue
set to red
set to green
set to blue
set to red
set to green
set to blue
turn off, turn on - [end of colour changing]
set brightness to 100%
set brightness to 50%
set brightness to 10%
set brightness to 50%
set brightness to 100%
turn off, turn on - [end of brightness]
</code></pre>

<p>This will help you to spot patterns in the data and see which bytes change depending on what you are doing.</p>

<h2 id="step-5--automated-e-waste-generator">Step 5.  Automated e-waste generator</h2>

<p>While exploring color changes, I observed that the app never sent a value higher than 0x1F (5 bits) for red, green, or blue. Curious, I tried sending 8-bit values, and it worked remarkably well — brighter colors!</p>

<p>Great success!</p>

<p>Excited by my discovery I got to wondering what other secrets this light controller was hiding from me.  I wonder if there are any additional effects beyond the 10 that the app uses?
A good way to try this out would be a simple loop.</p>

<pre><code>    for n in range(20):
        print(f"Setting effect {n}")
        set_effect(n)
        time.sleep(20)
</code></pre>

<p>I ran this and watched 1 to 10.  So far so good, then it ticked over to 11 and AH HA!  I have found a secret mode!
Then it ticked over to 12 and… darkness.</p>

<p>Oh well, I guess there are only 11 effects, that’s fine.  I’ll reboot it and finish off the rest of the code.</p>

<p>And that was then end of my fun.</p>

<p>The lights never came back.</p>

<p>They don’t advertise on Bluetooth any more and I can’t connect to them.  I’ve tried holding down the button when turning them on.  I’ve left them unplugged over night to see if that helps, but no.</p>

<p>They are dead.</p>

<p>I guess I overflowed some buffer and I’ve corrupted the firmware.</p>

<p>All is not lost however.  The LEDs themselves are standard addressable LEDs so I can at least hook the string up to a different microcontroller and use them.</p>

<h2 id="tell-me-how-i-can-break-my-own-lights">Tell me how I can break my own lights</h2>

<p>Despite the setback, I documented most of the protocol and created a Github project with a Home Assistant custom component. It works, but proceed at your own risk.</p>

    <p>Amazon’s Yang Liu, general chair of this year’s meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, on the road ahead for LLMs.</p>


          </div>
    </div>
</ps-related-content>
</div><p>Specifically, LLMs use multihead attention, meaning that they apply multiple attention mechanisms, or heads, in parallel. OPT-66B has 64 layers with 72 attention heads in each layer. The output of the multihead attention passes through a separate feed-forward network (FFN) at each layer.</p><p>Our first method for analyzing OPT-66B was to assign a score to each attention head and FFN indicating how important they were to a given task. On the basis of those scores, we then pruned the model.</p><p>We found that important attention heads are primarily clustered in the model’s intermediate layers, and important FFNs are primarily in later layers. The ability to perform zero-/few-shot in-context learning on 14 different natural-language-processing (NLP) datasets/tasks stayed nearly intact when up to 70% (~15.7B parameters in OPT-66B) of the attention heads are removed.</p><div data-align-center=""><figure>
    

    
        <p><figcaption>A heat map representing attention heads’ aggregate importance scores for five-shot in-context learning across 14 NLP tasks, at each layer of the OPT-66B model.</figcaption></p>
    
</figure></div><p>The attention heads that are important (and unimportant) for in-context learning also seemed to overlap across tasks and shots. This indicates that a common task-agnostic subset of the attention heads is responsible for in-context learning. We also found that up to 20% of the FFNs (~8.5B parameters) can be removed with minimal decline in performance on zero-/few-shot in-context learning.</p><p>Our second analytic technique was to quantify the capacity of all attention heads in OPT-66B to perform a pair of task-agnostic primitive operations associated with in-context learning. Those primitives are <i>prefix matching</i> and <i>copying</i>: explicitly searching for a prior occurrence of the current token in context and copying over the token that succeeded it (its <i>suffix</i>).</p><div data-align-center=""><figure>
    

    
        <p><figcaption>Prefix matching and copying.</figcaption></p>
    
</figure></div><p>Heads specialized for these two operations were first discovered by the machine learning research company Anthropic and termed induction heads. We found that a small set of heads in OPT-66B have nontrivial scores for both primitives. We also found that these heads overlap (to varying degrees) with the heads important for specific tasks identified earlier. This indicates that induction heads are capable of more sophisticated behaviors associated with in-context learning, such as latent concept matching, but are not the only heads with such capabilities.</p><div data-align-right-rail=""><ps-related-content>

    <p>Generative AI raises new challenges in defining, measuring, and mitigating concerns about fairness, toxicity, and intellectual property, among other things. But work has started on the solutions.</p>

</ps-related-content>
</div><p>Our overarching observation that only a core nucleus of attention heads and FFNs seem to be important for in-context learning indicates that OPT-66B and quite likely other prominent LLMs are undertrained. This also reinforces recent research that questions the efficacy of keeping the amount of pretraining data fixed when scaling models up, suggesting that the amount of pretraining data seen must be scaled hand-in-hand with the models themselves to attain optimal performance. It would be interesting to see how newer variants of LLMs released since the publication of our study, such as those tuned to follow instructions, fare in such analyses.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>LinkedIn has abandoned its efforts to migrate its datacenter infrastructure to Microsoft Azure four years after announcing the planned move.</p>
<p>Citing sources familiar with the matter, CNBC <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/linkedin-shelved-plan-to-migrate-to-microsoft-azure-cloud.html">reports</a> the effort, codenamed "Blueshift," had run up against numerous challenges in the years since Microsoft acquired the professional networking site in 2016 for $27 billion.</p>
<p>In a statement to <em>The Register</em>, LinkedIn confirmed its plans to invest in its own datacenters while using Azure services where appropriate.</p>

    

<p>"This includes our running 100 employee-facing applications on Azure, leveraging Azure FrontDoor and ongoing work to consolidate our datacenter locations that are currently spread across multiple buildings under a single roof," the spokesperson said. "Azure has been crucial to support and scale collaboration and productivity for our teams to deliver value to our members."</p>

        


        

<p>The decision marks a reversal of LinkedIn's plans, <a target="_blank" href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2019/building-next-infra">announced</a> in a 2019 blog post, to migrate its workloads to a public cloud. At the time Mohak Shroff, the social network's SVP of engineering, touted the move as an opportunity to better support the site's growing membership.</p>
<p>"With the incredible member and business growth we're seeing, we've decided to begin a multi-year migration of all LinkedIn workloads to the public cloud," he wrote. "Moving to Azure will give us access to a wide array of hardware and software innovations, and unprecedented global scale."</p>

</ul>
<p>Over the past few years LinkedIn has deployed some services in Azure. In early 2022, the social network <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/accelerating-the-linkedin-experience-with-azure-front-door">tapped up</a> Azure FrontDoor, Microsoft's content delivery network, which caches commonly accessed content across a global network of edge datacenters reducing the bandwidth and access latencies required to serve users.</p>
<p>However, by mid-2022, CNBC reports, the cracks in LinkedIn's migration strategy were beginning to show. In a memo last summer, LinkedIn CTO Raghu Hiremagalur reportedly told employees LinkedIn was moving to a hybrid-cloud model with some services running in the cloud and others in the company's dedicated datacenters.</p>

        

<p>As it turned out, while Azure's scale may have presented a tantalizing opportunity at first blush, LinkedIn was having a hard time taking advantage of the cloud provider's software. Sources told CNBC that issues arose when LinkedIn attempted to lift and shift its existing software tools to Azure rather than refactor them to run on the cloud provider's ready made tools. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>About a year ago, I tried thinking which database I should choose for my next project, and came to the realization that I don't really know the differences of databases enough. I went to different database websites and saw mostly marketing and words I don't understand.</p><p>This is when I decided to read the excellent books <code>Database Internals</code> by Alex Petrov and <code>Designing Data-Intensive Applications</code> by Martin Kleppmann.</p><p>The books piqued my curiosity enough to write my own little database I called <a href="https://github.com/tontinton/dbeel">dbeel</a>.</p><p>This post is basically a short summary of these books, with a focus on the fundamental problems a database engineer thinks about in the shower.</p><h2 id="bashdb">bashdb</h2><p>Let's start with the simplest database program ever written, just 2 bash functions (we'll call it <code>bashdb</code>):</p><pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span>
</span><span>db_set</span><span>() {
</span><span>    </span><span>echo </span><span>"$</span><span>1</span><span>,$</span><span>2</span><span>" </span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> database

</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>Try it out:</p><pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>$</span><span> db_set 500 </span><span>'{"movie": "Airplane!", "rating": 9}'
</span><span>
</span><span>$</span><span> db_set 111 </span><span>'{"movie": "Tokio Drift", "rating": 6}'

</span></code></pre><p>Before you continue reading, I want you to pause and think about why you wouldn't use <code>bashdb</code> in production.</p><pre><code><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>Some space for you to think :)
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span></code></pre><p>You probably came up with at least a dozen issues in <code>bashdb</code>. Now I won't go over <em>all</em> of the possible issues, for this post I will focus on the following ones:</p><ul><li><strong>Durability</strong> - If the machine crashes after a successful <code>db_set</code>, the data might be lost, as it was not flushed to disk.</li><li><strong>Atomicity</strong> - If the machine crashes while you call <code>db_set</code>, data might be written partially, corrupting our data.</li><li><strong>Isolation</strong> - If one process calls <code>db_get</code>, while another calls <code>db_set</code> concurrently on the same item, the first process might read only part of the data, leading to a corrupt result.</li><li><strong>Performance</strong> - <code>db_get</code> uses <code>grep</code>, so search goes line by line and is <code>O(n)</code>, <code>n</code> = all items saved.</li></ul><p>Could you figure out these problems yourself? If you could, well done, you don't need me, you already understand databases 😀</p><p>In the next section, we'll try get rid of these problems, to make <code>bashdb</code> a <em>real</em> database we might use in production (not really, please don't, just use <code>PostgreSQL</code>).</p><h2 id="improving-bashdb-to-be-acid">Improving bashdb to be ACID</h2><p>Before we begin, know that I did not come up with most of these problems on my own, they are part of an acronym named <code>ACID</code>, which almost all databases strive to guarantee:</p><ul><li><strong>Atomicity</strong> - Not to be confused with multi-threading's definition of atomicity (which is more similar to isolation), a transaction is considered atomic when a fault happens in the middle of a write, and the database either undos or aborts it completely, as if the write never started, leaving no partially written data.</li><li><strong>Consistency</strong> - This one doesn't really belong on ACID as a property of databases, as it is a property of the application.</li><li><strong>Isolation</strong> - No race conditions in concurrent accesses to the same data. There are multiple isolation levels, and we will discuss some of them later.</li><li><strong>Durability</strong> - The first thing that comes to mind when talking about a database. It should store data you wrote to it, forever, even in the event of monkeys pulling the power plug out.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Not all databases need to guarantee ACID, for some use cases, it is fine to drop guarantees for performance reasons.</p></blockquote><p>But <em>how</em> can we make <code>bashdb</code> ACID?</p><p>We can start with durability, as it's pretty easy to make <code>bashdb</code> durable by running <code>sync</code> right after writing in <code>db_set</code>:</p><pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>db_set</span><span>() {
</span><span>    </span><span>echo </span><span>"$</span><span>1</span><span>,$</span><span>2</span><span>" </span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> database </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>sync</span><span> -d</span><span> database
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>But wait a minute, what is going on, what is <code>sync</code> really doing? And what is that <code>-d</code>?</p><h3 id="durability">Durability</h3><p>The <code>write</code> syscall writes a buffer to a file, but who said it writes to disk?</p><p>The buffer you write could end up in any cache along the way to the non volatile memory. For example, the kernel stores the buffer in the page cache with each page marked as dirty, meaning it will flush it to disk sometime in the future.</p><p>To make matters worse, the disk device, or something managing your disks (for example a RAID system), might have a write cache as well.</p><p>So how do you tell all the systems in the middle to flush all dirty pages to the disk? For that we have <code>fsync</code> / <code>fdatasync</code>, let's see what <code>man</code> has to say:</p><pre><code><span>$ man 2 fsync
</span><span>
</span><span>...
</span><span>
</span><span>fsync() transfers ("flushes") all modified in-core data of (i.e., modified buffer cache pages for)
</span><span>the file referred to by the file descriptor fd to the disk device (or other permanent storage
</span><span>device) so that all changed information can be retrieved even if the system crashes or is rebooted.
</span><span>This includes writing through or flushing a disk cache if present.
</span><span>The call blocks until the device reports that the transfer has completed.
</span><span>
</span><span>...
</span><span>
</span><span>fdatasync() is similar to fsync(), but does not flush modified metadata unless that metadata itself
</span><span>in order to allow a subsequent data  retrieval to be correctly handled.
</span><span>
</span><span>...
</span></code></pre><p>In short, <code>fdatasync</code> flushes the dirty raw buffers we gave <code>write</code>. <code>fsync</code> also flushes the file's metadata like <code>mtime</code>, which we don't really care about.</p><p>The <code>sync</code> program is basically like running <code>fsync</code> on all dirty pages, unless a specific file is specified as one of the arguments. It has the <code>-d</code> flag for us to call <code>fdatasync</code> instead of <code>fsync</code>.</p><p>The biggest drawback in adding <code>sync</code> is that we get worse performance. Usually sync is slower than even the write itself. But hey, at least we are now <em>durable</em>.</p><blockquote><p>A short but important note about fsync. When fsync() returns success it means "all writes since the last fsync have hit disk" when you might have assumed it means "all writes since the last SUCCESSFUL fsync have hit disk". PostgreSQL learned about this only recently (2018), which led to them modifying the behavior of syncing from retrying fsync until a success is returned, to simply panic on fsync failure. This incident got famous and was named fsyncgate. You can learn a lot more about fsync failures <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc20-rebello.pdf">here</a>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Dear <code>MongoDB</code> users, know that by default writes are <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/journaling/writes">synced every 100ms</a>, meaning it is not 100% durable.</p></blockquote><h3 id="isolation">Isolation</h3><p>The simplest way to have multiprocess isolation in <code>bashdb</code> is to add a lock before we read / write to the storage file.</p><p>There's a program in linux called <code>flock</code>, which locks a file, and you can even provide it with the <code>-s</code> flag, to specify that you will not modify the file, meaning all callers who specify <code>-s</code> are allowed to read the file concurrently. <code>flock</code> blocks until it has taken the lock.</p><blockquote><p>flock simply calls the flock syscall</p></blockquote><p>With such an awesome program, <code>bashdb</code> can guarantee <em>isolation</em>, here's the code:</p><pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span>db_set</span><span>() {
</span><span>    (
</span><span>        </span><span>flock</span><span> 9 </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>echo </span><span>"$</span><span>1</span><span>,$</span><span>2</span><span>" </span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> database
</span><span>    ) </span><span>9</span><span>&gt;</span><span>database.lock

</span><span>    (
</span><span>        </span><span>flock</span><span> -s</span><span> 9 </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>grep </span><span>"^$</span><span>1</span><span>,"</span><span> database </span><span>| </span><span>sed</span><span> -e </span><span>"s/^$</span><span>1</span><span>,//" </span><span>| </span><span>tail</span><span> -n</span><span> 1
</span><span>    ) </span><span>9</span><span>&gt;</span><span>database.lock
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>The biggest drawback is that we are now locking the entire database whenever we write to it.</p><p>The only things left are atomicity and improving the algorithm to not be <code>O(n)</code>.</p><h2 id="bad-news">Bad News</h2><p>I'm sorry, this is as far as I could get with <code>bashdb</code>, I could not find a simple way to ensure atomicity in bash ☹️</p><p>And even if it was possible, we still need to fix the <code>O(n)</code> situation.</p><p>Before beginning the <code>bashdb</code> adventure, I knew that we won't be able to easily solve all these problems in less than 10 lines of bash, but by trying to, you've hopefully started to get a feel for the problems database engineers face.</p><h2 id="storage-engine">Storage Engine</h2><p>Let's start with the first big component of a database, the <code>Storage Engine</code>.</p><p>The purpose of the storage engine is to provide an abstraction over reading and writing data to persistent storage, with the main goal to be <strong>fast</strong>, i.e. have <strong>high throughput</strong> and <strong>low latency</strong> on requests.</p><p>But what makes software slow?</p><pre><code><span>Latency Comparison Numbers (~2012)

Also, modern CPUs execute multiple operations in parallel when it operates on sequential memory thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data">SIMD</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_pipelining">instruction pipelining</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_prefetching">prefetching</a>. You would be surprised just how far reading sequential memory can take you in terms of performance.</p><p>There's a variation of the B-tree that takes this model even further, called a B+ tree, where the final leaf nodes hold a value and all other nodes hold only keys, thus fetching a page from disk results in a lot more keys to compare.</p><p>B-trees, to be space optimized, need to sometimes reclaim space as a consequence of data fragmentation created by operations on the tree like:</p><ul><li>Big value updates - updating a value into a larger value might overwrite data of the next node, so the tree relocates the item to a different location, leaving a "hole" in the original page.</li><li>Small value updates - updating a value to a smaller value leaves a "hole" at the end.</li><li>Deletes - deletion causes a "hole" right where the deleted value used to reside.</li></ul><p>The process that takes care of space reclamation and page rewrites can sometimes be called vacuum, compaction, page defragmentation, and maintenance. It is usually done in the background to not interfere and cause latency spikes to user requests.</p><blockquote><p>See for example how in <code>PostgreSQL</code> you can configure an <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/routine-vacuuming.html">auto vacuum daemon</a>.</p></blockquote><p>B-trees are most commonly used as the underlying data structure of an index (<code>PostgreSQL</code> creates B-tree indexes by default), or all data (I've seen <code>DynamoDB</code> once jokingly called <em>"a distributed B-tree"</em>).</p><h2 id="immutable-lsm-tree">Immutable LSM Tree</h2><p>As we have already seen in the latency comparison numbers table, disk seeks are really expensive, which is why the idea of sequentially written immutable data structures got so popular.</p><p>The idea is that if you only append data to a file, the disk needle doesn't need to move as much to the next position where data will be written. On write heavy workloads it has been proven very beneficial.</p><p>One such append only data structure is called the <code>Log Structured Merge tree</code> or <code>LSM tree</code> in short, and is what powers <em>a lot</em> of modern database storage engines, such as <code>RocksDB</code>, <code>Cassandra</code> and my personal favorite <code>ScyllaDB</code>.</p><p>LSM trees' general concept is to buffer writes to a data structure in memory, preferably one that is easy to iterate in a sorted fashion (for example <code>AVL tree</code> / <code>Red Black tree</code> / <code>Skip List</code>), and once it reaches some capacity, flush it sorted to a new file called a <code>Sorted String Table</code> or <code>SSTable</code>.

An item might be removed and then resurrected on compaction with another file that holds that item, even if the write happened before the deletion, there is no way to know once deleted in a previous compaction. <code>RocksDB</code> keeps tombstones around until a compaction of files that result in a promotion to the last level.</p><h3 id="bloom-filters">Bloom Filters</h3><p>LSM trees can be further optimized by something called a bloom filter.</p><p>A bloom filter is a probabilistic set data structure that lets you to efficiently check whether an item doesn't exist in a set.

Also known as optimistic concurrency control.</li><li>Read a copy of the data - MVCC (Multiversion concurrency control) is a common method used to avoid blocking user requests. In MVCC when data is mutated, instead of locking + overwriting it, you create a new version of the data that new requests read from. Once no readers remain that are reading the old data it can be safely removed. With MVCC, each user sees a <em>snapshot</em> of the database at a specific instant in time.</li></ul><p>Some applications don't require perfect isolation (or <code>Serializable Isolation</code>), and can relax their read isolation levels.</p><p>The ANSI/ISO standard SQL 92 includes 3 different possible outcomes from reading data in a transaction, while another transaction might have updated that data:</p><ul><li><strong>Dirty reads</strong> - A dirty read occurs when a transaction retrieves a row that has been updated by another transaction that is not yet committed.</li></ul><pre data-lang="sql"><code data-lang="sql"><span>BEGIN</span><span>;

Please avoid using distributed systems when non distributed solutions suffice.</p><blockquote><p>A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn’t even know existed can render your own computer unusable. ~Leslie Lamport</p></blockquote><p>The common use cases of needing to distribute data across multiple machines are:</p><ul><li><strong>Availability</strong> - If for some reason the machine running the database crashes / disconnects from our users, we might still want to let users use the application. By distributing data, when one machine fails, you can simply point requests to another machine holding the "redundant" data.</li><li><strong>Horizontal Scaling</strong> - Conventionally, when an application needed to serve more user requests than it can handle, we would have upgraded the machine's resources (faster / more disk, RAM, CPUs). This is called <code>Vertical Scaling</code>. It can get very expensive and for some workloads there just doesn't exist hardware to match the amount of resources needed. Also, most of the time you don't need all those resources, except in peaks of traffic (imagine shopify on black Friday). Another strategy called <code>Horizontal Scaling</code>, is to operate on multiple separate machines connected over a network, seemingly working as a single machine.</li></ul><p>Sounds like a dream, right? What can go wrong with going distributed?</p><p>Well, you have now introduced operational complexity (deployments / etc...) and more importantly partitioning / network partitioning, infamous for being the P in something called the CAP theorem.</p><p>The CAP theorem states that a system can guarantee only 2 of the following 3:</p><ul><li><strong>Consistency</strong> - Reads receive the most recent write.</li><li><strong>Availability</strong> - All requests succeed, no matter the failures.</li><li><strong>Partition Tolerance</strong> - The system continues to operate despite dropped / delayed messages between nodes.</li></ul><p>To understand why this is, imagine a database operating on a single machine. It is definitely <em>partition tolerant</em>, as messages in the system are not sent through something like a network, but through function calls operating on the same hardware (CPU / memory). It is also <em>consistent</em>, as the state of the data is saved on the same hardware (memory / disk) that all other read / write requests operate on. Once the machine fails (be it software failures like SIGSEGV or hardware failures like the disk overheating) all new requests to it fail, violating <em>availability</em>.</p><p>Now imagine a database operating on 2 machines with separate CPUs, memory and disks, connected through some cable. When a request to one of the machines fails, for whatever reason, the system can choose to do one of the following:</p><ul><li>Cancel the request, thus sacrificing <em>availability</em> for <em>consistency</em>.</li><li>Allow the request to continue only on the working machine, meaning once the other machine will now have inconsistent data (reads from it will not return the most recent write), thus sacrificing <em>consistency</em> for <em>availability</em>. When a system does this, it is called eventually consistent.</li></ul><p>The original <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">dynamo paper</a> is famous for many things, one of them being amazon stating that amazon.com's shopping cart should be highly available, and that it's more important to them than consistency. In the unlikely scenario a user sees 2 of the same item in the shopping cart, they will simply remove one of them, which is a better situation then them not being able to purchase and pay money!</p><blockquote><p>I really enjoy out of the box thinking of sacrificing something that adds software complexity (like consistency in amazon's shopping cart) for a simpler human solution like the user getting a refund. Software complexity can get more expensive to operate than having a refund budget for example.</p></blockquote><p>To achieve <em>availability</em> it's not enough to have multiple nodes together combining all the data, there must also be data redundancy, or in other words, for each item a node stores there must be at least 1 other node to store a copy of that item. These nodes are usually called <strong>replicas</strong>, and the process of copying the data is called <strong>replication</strong>.</p><p>Assigning more replica nodes means that the system will be more <em>available</em>, with the obvious drawback of needing more resources to store all these copies.</p><blockquote><p>Copies of data don't need to be stored "whole", they can be split and scattered across multiple nodes using a technique called erasure coding, which also has some interesting <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2023/01/06/erasure.html">latency characteristics</a> (by the way brooker's blog is simply amazing for learning distributed systems).</p></blockquote><h2 id="consistent-hashing">Consistent Hashing</h2><p>Now that you have multiple nodes, you need some kind of load balancing / data partitioning method. When a request to store some data comes in, how do you determine which node receives the request?</p><p>You could go for the simplest solution, which is to simply always take a primary key (some id) in addition to the data, hash the key and modulo the result by the number of available nodes, something like:</p><pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>def </span><span>get_owning_node</span><span>(</span><span>nodes</span><span>, </span><span>key</span><span>):
</span><span>    </span><span>return </span><span>nodes[</span><span>hash</span><span>(key) </span><span>% </span><span>len</span><span>(nodes)] 
</span></code></pre><p>This modulo method works fine, until a node is either added or removed from the cluster. Once that happens, the calculation returns a different result because the number of available nodes changed, meaning a different node will be selected for the same key. To accommodate, each node can migrate keys that should now live on different nodes, but then almost all items are migrated, which is really expensive.</p><p>One method to lower the amount of items to be migrated on node addition / removal that is used by some databases (e.g. <code>Dynamo</code> and <code>Cassandra</code>) is <code>Consistent Hashing</code>.</p><p>Consistent hashing creates a ring of nodes instead of an array, placing each node's name hash on the ring. Then each request's key is hashed just like before, but instead of doing the modulo operation, we get the first node in the ring whose name's hash is greater or equal to the request key hash:</p><pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span># Assume nodes are sorted, with the first node having the smallest hash value.

</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>return </span><span>nodes[</span><span>0</span><span>]
</span></code></pre><p>For a visual explanation, imagine a ring that goes from 0 -&gt; 99, holding nodes with the names "half", "quarter" and "zero" whose hashes are 50, 25 and 0 respectively:</p><pre><code><span>   zero
</span><span> /      \
</span><span>|     quarter 
</span><span> \      /
</span><span>   half
</span></code></pre><p>Let's say a user now wants to set an item with the key "four-fifths", with a hash value of 80. The first node with a name hash greater or equal to 80 is "half" (with hash value of 50), so that's the node to receive the request!</p><p>Choosing replicas is very simple, when an item is set to be stored on a specific node, go around the ring counter-clockwise, the next node will store a copy of that item. In our example, "zero" is the replica node for all items "half" owns, so when "half" dies and requests will now be routed to "zero", it can serve these requests, keeping our system <em>available</em>. This method is sometimes called <code>Leaderless Replication</code> and is used by "Dynamo" style databases like <code>Cassandra</code>.</p><blockquote><p>Another method is to choose a leader node and replica nodes is <code>Leader Election</code>, which is a huge topic on its own that I won't get into in this post.</p></blockquote><p>Now, what happens when a node is added to the cluster? Let's add a node named "three-quarters" with a hash value of 75, the item "four-fifths" should be migrated to the new "three-quarters" node, as new requests to it will now point to it.</p><p>This migration process is a lot less expensive than what we previously had in the modulo solution. The number of keys that need to be migrated is equal to <code>num_keys / num_nodes</code> on average.</p><p>A cool trick is to introduce the concept of virtual nodes, where you add multiple instances of a node to the ring, to lower the chances of some nodes owning more items than other nodes (in our example "half" will store twice as many items on average than the other nodes). You can generate virtual node names by for example adding an index as a suffix to the node name ("half-0", "half-1", etc...) and then the hash will result in a completely different location on the ring.</p><p>Here's a more detailed example of a migration in a cluster with a replication factor of 3:</p><img src="https://tontinton.com/migration.svg"><blockquote><p>Same colored nodes are virtual nodes of the same node, green arrows show to which node an item is being migrated to, red arrows show item deletions from nodes and the brown diamonds are items.</p></blockquote><h2 id="leaderless-replication">Leaderless Replication</h2><p>In a leaderless setup, you get amazing <em>availability</em>, while sacrificing <em>consistency</em>. If the owning node is down on a write request, it will be written to the replica, and once the owning node is up and running again, a read request will read stale data.</p><p>When <em>consistency</em> is needed for a specific request, read requests can be sent in parallel to several replica nodes as well as to the owning node. The client will pick the most up to date data. Write requests are usually sent in parallel to all replica nodes but wait for an acknowledgement from only some of them. By choosing the number of read requests and number of write requests acknowledge, you can tune the <em>consistency</em> level on a request level.</p><p>To know whether a request is <em>consistent</em>, you just need to validate that <code>R + W &gt; N/2 + 1</code>, where:</p><ul><li><strong>N</strong> - Number of nodes holding a copy of the data.</li><li><strong>W</strong> - Number of nodes that will acknowledge a write for it to succeed.</li><li><strong>R</strong> - Number of nodes that have to respond to a read operation for it to succeed.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Sending a request to a majority of nodes (where <code>W</code> or <code>R</code> is equal to <code>N/2 + 1</code>) is called a quorum.</p></blockquote><p>Picking the correct read as the latest written one is called <code>Conflict Resolution</code> and it is not a simple task, you might think that simply comparing timestamps and choosing the biggest one is enough, but using times in a distributed system are unreliable.</p><blockquote><p>This didn't stop <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/architecture/dynamo.html#data-versioning">Cassandra from using timestamps</a> though.</p></blockquote><p>Each machine has its own hardware clock, and the clocks <em>drift</em> apart as they are not perfectly accurate (usually a quartz crystal oscillator). Synchronizing clocks using NTP (Network Time Protocol), where a server returns the time from a more accurate time source such as a GPS receiver, is not enough to provide accurate results, as the NTP request is over the network (another distributed system) and we can't know exactly how much time will pass before receiving a response.</p><blockquote><p>Google's <code>Spanner</code> actually did achieve consistency with clocks, by uses special high precision time hardware and its API exposes the time range uncertainty of each timestamp. You can read more about it <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub39966.pdf">here</a>.</p></blockquote><p>But if clocks are so unreliable, how else are we supposed to know which value is correct?</p><p>Some systems (for example <code>Dynamo</code>) try to solve this partially using <code>Version Vectors</code>, where you attach a (node, counter) pair for each version of an item, which gives you the ability to find causality between the different versions. By finding versions of values that are definitely newer (have a higher counter) you can remove some versions of a value, which makes the problem easier.</p><img src="https://tontinton.com/version_vector.svg"><blockquote><p>An example showing how easily conflicts arise. At the end we are left with {v2, v3} as the conflicting values for the same key. The reason I removed v1 is to show that by using something like <code>Version Vectors</code>, versions of values can be safely removed to minimize the amount of conflicts. To learn more on <code>Version Vectors</code> and their implementations, I recommend reading <a href="https://github.com/ricardobcl/Dotted-Version-Vectors">Dotted Version Vectors</a>.</p></blockquote><p>We could also decide to simply let the application decide how to deal with conflicts, by returning all conflicting values for the requested item. The application might know a lot more on the data than the database, so why not let it resolve conflicts? This is what <code>Riak KV</code> does for example.</p><blockquote><p>An idea I think about often is that you could even allow users to compile conflict resolution logic as a WASM module, and upload it to the database, so that when conflicts occur, the database resolves them, never relying on the application.</p></blockquote><p>There are lots of different ideas to reduce conflicts in an eventually consistent system, they usually fall under the umbrella term <code>Anti Entropy</code>.</p><h2 id="anti-entropy">Anti Entropy</h2><p>Here are examples of some of the most popular <code>Anti Entropy</code> mechanisms:</p><p><strong>Read Repair</strong> - After a client chooses the "latest" value from a read request that went to multiple nodes (by conflict resolution), it sends that value back to all the nodes that don't currently store that value, thus <em>repairing</em> them.</p><p><strong>Hinted Handoff</strong> - When a write request can't reach one of the target nodes, send it instead as a "hint" to some other node. As soon as that target node is available again, send it the saved "hint". On a quorum write, this mechanism is also called <code>Sloppy Quorum</code>, which provides even better <em>availability</em> for quorum requests.</p><p><strong>Merkle Trees</strong> - Because read repair only fixes queried data, a lot of data can still become inconsistent for a long time. Nodes can choose to start a synchronization process by talking to each other and see the differences in data. This is really expensive when there is a lot of data (<code>O(n)</code>). To make the sync algorithm faster (<code>O(log n)</code>) we can introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">merkle trees</a>. A merkle tree stores the hash of a range of the data in lowest leaf nodes, with the parent leaf nodes being a combined hash of the 2 of its children, thus creating a hierarchy of hashes up to the root of the tree. The sync process now starts by one node comparing the root of the merkle tree to another node's merkle tree, if the hashes are the same, it means they have exactly the same data. If the hashes differ, the leaf hashes are checked the same way, recursively until the inconsistent data is found.</p><p><strong>Gossip Dissemination</strong> - Send broadcast events to all nodes in the cluster in a simple and reliable way, by imitating how humans spread rumors or a disease. You send the event message to a configured number of randomly chosen nodes (called the "fanout"), then when they receive the message they repeat the process and send the message to another set of randomly chosen <code>N</code> nodes. To not repeat the message forever in the cluster, a node stops broadcasting a gossip message when it sees it a configured number of times. To get a feel for how data converges using gossip, head over to the <a href="https://www.serf.io/docs/internals/simulator.html">simulator</a>! As an optimization, gossip messages are usually sent using UDP, as the mechanism is just that reliable.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>There is a lot more to talk about databases, be it the use of <a href="https://yarchive.net/comp/linux/o_direct.html">O_DIRECT</a> in linux and implementing your own page cache, failure detection in distributed systems, consensus algorithms like <a href="https://raft.github.io/">raft</a>, distributed transactions, leader election, and an almost infinite amount more.</p><p>I hope I have piqued your curiosity enough to explore the world of databases further, or provided the tools for you to better understand which database to pick in your next project 😀</p></section></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://spritely.institute/static/images/blog/hoot-meta-repl.gif" alt="Hoot metacircular evaluator demo recording"></p><p>Hey, folks!  Today we want to talk about the wonderful
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">read-eval-print-loop
(REPL)</a>.
Thanks to WebAssembly (Wasm), it's becoming increasingly common for
programming language websites to embed a REPL in which passersby can
easily evaluate code and get a feel for the language without having to
install anything on their computer.  We'd like to do the same thing
for our language of choice, <a href="https://gnu.org/software/guile">Guile
Scheme</a>, using <a href="https://spritely.institute/hoot">Guile Hoot</a>.</p><p>Guile Hoot is a Scheme-to-Wasm compiler that leverages the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/wasmgc">Wasm
garbage collection (GC)
extension</a> that has been
rolling out to major browsers recently.  Wasm GC has finally made it
possible to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language">dynamic
languages</a>
<em>besides JavaScript</em> on the client-side web, but it will still take
some additional effort to bring our favorite tools along for the ride.
In this post, we'll walk through building a tiny Scheme interpreter
with a simple user interface and explain what's in store for the
future.</p><p>To learn more about Hoot, check out the <a href="https://spritely.institute/news/guile-hoot-v020-released.html">0.2.0 release
announcement</a> from a couple of
weeks ago!</p><h3>The case of the missing REPL</h3><p>For Scheme programmers (and Lisp programmers in general), the REPL is
at the core of our development workflow.  We modify some code in our
text editor, evaluate it in the REPL, inspect the output or enter a
debugger, and repeat the process until the program behaves the way we
want.</p><p>We're used to having a native REPL process running directly on our
operating system, but since Hoot is putting Scheme on the web, we'd
really like a REPL available in the browser, too.  A web REPL would be
convenient for seasoned Schemers and newcomers alike.  However, at
this early stage in Hoot's development, a fully-featured Scheme REPL
is not yet possible.  We don't have access to the macro expander,
interpreter, etc. from the comfort of our Wasm runtime... yet.</p><p>We'll have these things eventually, but what can we have now?</p><p>Well, we could implement an interpreter for a small subset of
Scheme... in Scheme!  Sounds pretty recursive, and if you know
anything about Schemers you know we love recursion (and also, that we
love recursion), so let's give it a shot!</p><h3>Scheme in Scheme</h3><p>In Chapter 4 of the classic computer science textbook <a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book-Z-H-25.html#%_chap_4">Structure and
Interpretation of Computer
Programs</a>
(SICP), Gerald Sussman and Hal Abelson walk through building a small
Scheme interpreter embedded in Scheme.  They called this the
"metacircular evaluator", meaning that it's an interpreter written in
the language that it is interpreting.</p><p>This sounds pretty fancy — the kind of task reserved for MIT
professors that write iconic textbooks — but implementing a Scheme
interpreter is simpler than one might think!  For one thing, since
Scheme can manipulate its own syntax by design, we don't need to spend
any time parsing, a notoriously complex subject in its own right.  We
can skip directly to the fun part instead: evaluation!</p><p>Spritely's own <a href="https://spritely.institute/static/papers/scheme-primer.html">Scheme
Primer</a>
distills SICP's interpreter into a much simpler form intended for
people who are brand new to Scheme.  The code examples in the rest of
this post are derived from the "Scheme in Scheme" section of the
Primer.  If you're completely new to Scheme and want to better
understand the code in this post, consider working through our Primer
sometime!</p><p><img src="https://spritely.institute/static/images/blog/eval-apply.png" alt="eval/apply diagram from Andres Raba's unofficial SICP, licensedunder Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 InternationalLicense"></p><p>The metacircular evaluator is composed of two main components: <code>eval</code>
and <code>apply</code>:</p><ul><li><code>eval</code> processes an expression in the context of an environment.</li><li><code>apply</code> calls a procedure (function) with a list of arguments.</li></ul><p>The output of <code>eval</code> is fed to <code>apply</code>, which may feed more input to
<code>eval</code>, and this mutually recursive cycle continues until the program
runs out of expressions to evaluate.</p><p>In order to implement <code>eval</code>, we first need a way to represent
environments.  An environment maps variable names to their bound
values.  We'll use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_list">association
lists</a> for our
environments.</p><p>An empty environment with no variable bindings is represented by the
empty list <code>'()</code>.</p><p>The first bit of code from the metacircular evaluator we'll cover is
the <code>extend-env</code> procedure, which creates a new environment by
extending an existing one:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>define</span> <span>(</span><span>extend-env</span> <span>env</span> <span>names</span> <span>vals</span><span>)</span>
  <span>;; If there are no more variables to add to env, return env.
</span>  <span>(</span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>null?</span> <span>names</span><span>)</span>
      <span>env</span>
      <span>;; Otherwise, add the first binding to the recursive
</span>      <span>;; extension of env with the rest of the bindings.
</span>      <span>(</span><span>cons</span> <span>(</span><span>cons</span> <span>(</span><span>car</span> <span>names</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>car</span> <span>vals</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
            <span>(</span><span>extend-env</span> <span>env</span> <span>(</span><span>cdr</span> <span>names</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>cdr</span> <span>vals</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>We can extend the empty environment to make a new environment that
includes the variable <code>foo</code>:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>extend-env</span> <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>)</span> <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>; =&gt; ((foo . 1))</span></code></pre><p>We can further extend that environment to make a new environment that
includes the variable <code>bar</code>:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>extend-env</span> <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span> <span>.</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>bar</span><span>)</span> <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>; =&gt; ((bar . 2) (foo . 1))</span></code></pre><p>Note that environment manipulation is implemented in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional</a>
style.  Extending an environment does not mutate the original one.
This is because mutating the original environment would propagate the
new bindings to other evaluation contexts, potentially breaking
Scheme's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)">lexical scoping
rules</a>.</p><p>We can look up a variable's value using the <code>env-lookup</code> procedure:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>define</span> <span>(</span><span>env-lookup</span> <span>env</span> <span>name</span><span>)</span>
  <span>;; Lookup name in association list.
</span>  <span>(</span><span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>assq</span> <span>name</span> <span>env</span><span>)</span>
    <span>;; Success: return the bound value.
</span>    <span>(</span><span>(</span><span>_</span> <span>.</span> <span>val</span><span>)</span> <span>val</span><span>)</span>

<code>lambda</code> forms in our interpreter evaluate to regular Scheme
procedures, we can just use Scheme's built-in <code>apply</code> to pass
arguments to them.  Calling a procedure will recursively call <code>eval</code>
on the procedure's body expression.</p><p>Example:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>eval</span> <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>`</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>+</span> <span>.</span> <span>,+</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>; =&gt; 6</span></code></pre><p>Incidentally, we've created a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">capability-secure</a>
system reminiscent of <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/intro/introduction.html#security-considerations">Wasm's security
model</a>!
The program <code>(+ 1 2 3)</code> only has access to the <code>+</code> procedure from our
Scheme runtime.  Aside from creating unbounded loops, a devious
developer can't do any harm if their code is evaluated in this
restricted environment.  Neat!</p><h3>Scheme in Scheme on Wasm</h3><p>Now that we have a simple evaluator, we can compile it with Hoot to
run it inside a web browser.  But to actually use it, we need a user
interface.  To make one, we can borrow the React-like rendering code
we walked through in our previous tutorial on rendering web pages with
Wasm, <a href="https://spritely.institute/news/building-interactive-web-pages-with-guile-hoot.html">"Building interactive web pages with Guile
Hoot"</a>!</p><p>For simplicity, we'll go for a minimalist design reminiscent of a
terminal.  As for the REPL output log, we can store it as a list of
strings.  Let's pre-populate it with a friendly welcome message:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>define</span> <span>*log*</span>
  <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>"Welcome to the Hoot metacircular evaluator demo!

compiled to WebAssembly, and is running directly in the browser!  Its

our REPL from toy to full Scheme interpreter.</p><p>Once we do so, we could embed Scheme REPLs directly into documents
like the <em>Scheme Primer</em>, further reducing the activation energy
required to get started with Scheme.  And who knows what exciting
integrations our community will come up with?</p><p>In the meantime, if you'd like to start immediately hacking on the
REPL demo, you can find the complete source code on
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot-meta-repl">GitLab</a>.  If you're
into homework assignments, try adding support for more Scheme syntax
such as <code>let</code>, or adding more procedures to the environment to grant
more power to the interpreter.</p><p>And be sure to show off what you build with Hoot in our <a href="https://community.spritely.institute/">community
forum</a>!  (Use OCAPN2023 for the

They were expensive, bulky and captured images that were inferior to the organic look of film. After you downloaded and edited those whopping 3.1 megapixel images, you had very few options of where you could publish them online. Remember when Shutterfly and Snapfish were a thing?</p><p id="d82a">Contrast that to today where you have people shooting magazine covers on cell phones and uploading over 500,000 images to Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and Facebook every minute. We don’t hear about national tragedies on the news anymore, we read about them in our Twitter and Facebook feeds. Seconds after they happen.</p><p id="69e2">When the events of 9/11 took place there were thousands of photographs taken by professional photographers and members of the press. These images were shown on the news and published in magazines and newspapers all across the country. Yet, few of these featured photographs were taken by everyday people.</p><p id="0dc5">I wanted to set about curating a selection of photographs that most of you haven’t seen. Photographs captured by everyday people. Thanks to the internet these individuals have been able to publish their photos to Flickr, but most of them have less than a thousand, or even less than a hundred views. As I searched for these images it was like I was witnessing history again, but from an angle that no one had ever been shown. I decided to share these photographs with all of you.</p><p id="0b95">For the images that were captured on a digital camera, I’ve made a note of the model of the camera. All images are hosted on the account of the person that owns the photographs, none of them were taken down and re-hosted.</p><figure></figure><p id="968f">Seconds after flight 175 struck the South Tower.

It took me a few seconds to get my head together, and this was the shot I took. I’m not a professional photojournalist, but I believe having a camera in my hand and feeling like a I had a “job” to do helped me keep my head.”</p><figure></figure><p id="faff"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/hiro_oshima/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The photographer</a> who took this photo mentions that at the time it didn’t occur to him how bad of an idea it was to walk so close to the tower right after it was struck. Later he discovered that he had been hit in the leg by a piece of falling metal, but didn’t notice it until hours later after he had settled down. If you read the comments you’ll find one by the owner of the open delivery truck you see in this image. He mentioned that the driver of the truck, seen in the blue shirt and pants survived the ordeal. The truck, however, was crushed. This image and the following were taken on an Olympus E-10.</p><figure></figure><p id="2f29">This image struck me on a deep emotion level.

        <p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><strong>At a glance:</strong></span></p><ul><li><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"></span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><strong>During quiet waking, brain activity in mice suggests the animals are daydreaming about a recent image.</strong></span></li><li><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"></span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><strong>Having daydreams about a recently viewed image predicted how the brain would respond to the image in the future.</strong></span></li><li><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"></span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><strong>The findings provide a clue that daydreams may play a role in brain plasticity. </strong></span></p><hr></li></ul><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"></span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">You are sitting quietly, and suddenly your brain tunes out the world and wanders to something else entirely — perhaps a recent experience, or an old memory. You just had a daydream. </span></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Yet despite the ubiquity of this experience, what is happening in the brain while daydreaming is a question that has largely eluded neuroscientists. </span></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Now, a study in mice, </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06810-1"><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">published Dec. 13 in </span><em><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Nature</span></em></a><em><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">,</span></em><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"> has brought a team led by researchers at Harvard Medical School one step closer to figuring it out. </span></p><p><a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news-events/sign-email-communications"><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><strong>Get more HMS news here</strong></span></a><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"></span></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">The researchers tracked the activity of neurons in the visual cortex of the brains of mice while the animals remained in a quiet waking state. They found that occasionally these neurons fired in a pattern similar to one that occurred when a mouse looked at an actual image, suggesting that the mouse was thinking — or daydreaming — about the image. Moreover, the patterns of activity during a mouse’s first few daydreams of the day predicted how the brain’s response to the image would change over time. </span></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">The research provides tantalizing, if preliminary, evidence that daydreams can shape the brain’s future response to what it sees. This causal relationship needs to be confirmed in further research, the team cautioned, but the results offer an intriguing clue that daydreams during quiet waking may play a role in brain plasticity — the brain’s ability to remodel itself in response to new experiences.</span></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">“We wanted to know how this daydreaming process occurred on a neurobiological level, and whether these moments of quiet reflection could be important for learning and memory,” said lead author Nghia Nguyen, a PhD student in neurobiology in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS. </span></p><h3><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><strong>An overlooked brain region</strong></span></h3><div><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Scientists have spent considerable time studying how neurons replay past events to form memories and map the physical environment in the hippocampus, a seahorse-shaped brain region that plays a key role in memory and spatial navigation.</span></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">By contrast, there has been little research on the replay of neurons in other brain regions, including the visual cortex. Such efforts would provide valuable insights about how visual memories are formed. </span></p></div><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">“My lab became interested in whether we could record from enough neurons in the visual cortex to understand what exactly the mouse is remembering — and then connect that information to brain plasticity,” said senior author </span><a href="https://www.andermannlab.com/"><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Mark Andermann</span></a><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">, professor of medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and professor of neurobiology at HMS. </span></p><figure><article><img loading="lazy" src="https://hms.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/2023-12/MouseMovie-1-and-2-400x320.gif" width="400" height="320" alt="A checkerboard pattern of gray and black and white squares that morphs into another, similar pattern"></article><figcaption>During the experiments, mice repeatedly looked at one of two images, shown here, with one-minute breaks in between. The images were selected based on their ability to elicit a strong response from neurons in the visual cortex. Video: Andermann lab</figcaption></figure><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">In the new study, the researchers repeatedly showed mice one of two images, each consisting of a different checkerboard pattern of gray and dappled black and white squares. Between images, the mice spent a minute looking at a gray screen. The team simultaneously recorded activity from around 7,000 neurons in the visual cortex. </span></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">The researchers found that when a mouse looked at an image, the neurons fired in a specific pattern, and the patterns were different enough to discern image one from image two. More important, when a mouse looked at the gray screen between images, the neurons sometimes fired in a similar, but not identical, pattern, as when the mouse looked at the image, a sign that it was daydreaming about the image. These daydreams occurred only when mice were relaxed, characterized by calm behavior and small pupils. </span></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Unsurprisingly, mice daydreamed more about the most recent image — and they had more daydreams at the beginning of the day than at the end, when they had already seen each image dozens of times. </span></p><figure><article><img loading="lazy" src="https://hms.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/2023-12/FiringMouseNeurons-400x274.gif" width="400" height="274" alt="A grayscale image showing a cloud-like group of neurons lighting up"></article><figcaption>Between images, mice spent a minute looking at a gray screen. During this time, neurons in the visual cortex of the brain, shown here, occasionally fired in a pattern similar to one seen when the mice were looking at an image, suggesting that mice were daydreaming about the image. Video: Andermann lab</figcaption></figure><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">But what the researchers found next was completely unexpected. </span></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Throughout the day, and across days, the activity patterns seen when the mice looked at the images changed — what neuroscientists call “representational drift.” Yet this drift wasn’t random. Over time, the patterns associated with the images became even more different from each other, until each involved an almost entirely separate set of neurons. Notably, the pattern seen during a mouse’s first few daydreams about an image predicted what the pattern would become when the mouse looked at the image later. </span></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">“There’s drift in how the brain responds to the same image over time, and these early daydreams can predict where the drift is going,” Andermann said. </span></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Finally, the researchers found that the visual cortex daydreams occurred at the same time as replay activity occurred in the hippocampus, suggesting that the two brain regions were communicating during these daydreams. </span></p><h3><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><strong>To sit, perchance to daydream</strong></span></h3><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Based on the results of the study, the researches suspect that these daydreams may be actively involved in brain plasticity. </span></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">“When you see two different images many times, it becomes important to discriminate between them. Our findings suggest that daydreaming may guide this process by steering the neural patterns associated with the two images away from each other,” Nguyen said, while noting that this relationship needs to be confirmed. </span></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Nguyen added that learning to differentiate between the images should help the mouse respond to each image with more specificity in the future. </span></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">These observations align with a growing body of </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763422002883?casa_token=MBHEs_LeUGwAAAAA:KWgpbzTsGl7jv55nOZFGPssjIi-0j8-H1Th5rZ52Jxt71QglVXVsmU4BpcIhUAjtDw4QPyhXYHQ"><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">evidence in rodents and humans</span></a><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"> that entering a state of quiet wakefulness after an experience can improve learning and memory. </span></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Next, the researchers plan to use their imaging tools to visualize the connections between individual neurons in the visual cortex and to examine how these connections change when the brain “sees” an image. </span></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">“We were chasing this 99 percent of unexplored brain activity and discovered that there’s so much richness in the visual cortex that nobody knew anything about,” Andermann said. </span></p><p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Whether daydreams in people involve similar activity patterns in the visual cortex is an open question, and the answer will require additional experiments. However, there is preliminary evidence that an analogous process occurs in humans when they recall visual imagery.</span></p><p><a href="https://bucknerlab.fas.harvard.edu/"><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">Randy Buckner</span></a><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">, the Sosland Family Professor of Psychology and of Neuroscience at Harvard University, has shown that </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.97.20.11125"><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">brain activity in the visual cortex increases</span></a><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"> when people are asked to recall an image in detail.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
		
			<div>
					<p>
		Marc Corfmat was a teenager when he began to compete for Lego’s ultimate prize: the chance to design an official set. He and his brother Nick had been building custom Lego creations ever since they were kids, sometimes in California, sometimes during vacations at their grandparents’ home in La Rochelle, France. They shared their models <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MiniBrickProductions/videos">on YouTube</a> and posted their creations to Lego’s website, but interest from the Lego world came slowly, if it came at all.
</p>


					<p>
		Then, in 2020, the brothers started having some luck. <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/">The Lego Ideas program</a> gives fans the chance to turn their designs into reality, offering both fame and a small fortune —&nbsp;1 percent of net sales — to anyone who can convince 10,000 peers and The Lego Group that their set deserves to exist. After three years and 18 submissions, Marc finally cleared the 10,000-vote hurdle with a design based on <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/d0772ba6-298a-44df-ba84-f26faa8d7216"><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em></a>. A month later, <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/f4dead4b-7900-451a-9cfe-96c4ab3e756c">his <em>Tintin</em> idea</a> was chosen as a staff pick. <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/0b9f43ac-67c0-4108-9e82-a44d6574b8ab/official_comments#content_nav_tabs">Another design</a> based on <em>The Polar Express </em>hit 10,000 votes the next year.
</p>


					<p>
		And then… nothing. The <em>Tintin</em> votes dried up, and Lego rejected both his fan-favorite <em>Avatar</em> and <em>Polar Express </em>ideas<em>. </em>The company never says why it rejects an Ideas submission, only that deciding factors include everything from “playability” and “brand fit” to the difficulties in licensing another company’s IP.
</p>


					<p>
		“We knew it was almost impossible to get products on the shelves. You see maybe a few selected a year out of thousands of submissions — but even that slight glimmer of hope was enough to really keep us going,” says Marc, now a graduate student in mechanical engineering at the University of California, Davis.
</p>


					<p>
		Then, he decided to try an idea that had been noodling about his brain: a Polaroid, like one of the instant cameras his sister Mia liked using. Marc wasn’t a Polaroid devotee himself, but he’d liked the iconic look of the original 1977 Polaroid OneStep. The rainbow stripe camera had lived on his internal mood board for “quite some time,” but when he saw that a 2020 Lego <em>Minions</em> set had introduced <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=68327&amp;in=S">the perfect size lens ring</a> for his purposes, he decided to begin building.

		Everything just clicked. “All the angles were lining up perfectly, everything was working,” he says. “It very quickly became apparent to me that I was falling in love with this thing.”&nbsp;
</p>


					<p>
		And realizing that, Marc decided to do something differently with his Lego Ideas submission in January 2022: he made it <em>move</em>. His model let you “load film” by opening the iconic hinged door, then “eject” a photo by turning a dial or sliding a hidden lever underneath. For the first time, he <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/200dd32e-8ec8-44aa-8f7d-e4dcc6f74e5c">showed off motion on the web</a> in crisp, clean animations that made the gadgety design look irresistible. It got the “staff pick” nod in under two weeks and hit 10,000 supporters in under two months. And this time, Lego finally got in touch.
</p>


					<p>
		Today, Lego is opening preorders for its replica of the classic rainbow stripe Polaroid OneStep SX-70 instant camera, based on Marc’s homegrown build. Lego sent one to <em>The Verge</em> to build and toy with, and as I’ll explain later, the $80 / €80 / £70 set is a delight. Lego also granted us multiple interviews to discuss <em>how</em> a Lego dream comes to life —&nbsp;and the challenges that come with turning a fan-made design into a ready-to-sell product.

		Each project moving through the Lego Ideas program starts the same way: a Lego designer tries to replicate the original fan creation in the real world to see what works and what doesn’t. In Lego’s Billund, Denmark, headquarters, designers walk through a room called the Brick Library that’s filled with veritable supermarket aisles of parts sorted by color and shape. They can take whatever they need.
</p>


					<p>
		<a href="https://brickset.com/sets/designer-Jordan-Scott/">Jordan David Scott</a>, a creative lead in the Lego Ideas program, says that creating a true Lego set <em>isn’t </em>a straightforward series of steps. Though Marc’s Polaroid set was well built, every set must go through stringent quality control that inevitably leads to changes. To pass, even Lego’s seasoned designers head back to the drawing board to swap out parts again and again.&nbsp;
</p>


					<p>
		In addition to production, packing, packaging, and marketing, Lego has a host of teams that work directly with designers, including a function testing department, a safety department, an engineering department, and a textile department. There’s even a dedicated “building instructions” department and a “model quality” team, each of which sits with designers and watches them build. They make sure the build process stays fun, the instructions make sense, and the model stays stable enough that there’s little chance it breaks while you build it. “It’s like the final exam of the design process,” says Lego designer <a href="https://brickset.com/sets/designer-James-May">James May</a>.&nbsp;
</p>


					<p>
		While some designers think in bricks, May tells me he thinks in Lego’s internal design tool. While it’s similar to fan-facing tools like <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page">BrickLink Studio</a>, which lets designers automatically snap together digital bricks, the internal Lego version is linked to the company’s other projects and systems. That means he can collaborate with fellow designers, see which new Lego elements are becoming available, and even budget how much pieces will cost and how many bags of parts will be created and boxed in the final set.&nbsp;
</p>


					<p>
		May is the primary builder on the Polaroid set, and that means building the Lego camera many, many times over a matter of months — some digitally, some picture-perfect physical sets, and some physical models in random colors just for stress testing. One gets baked in an oven to simulate the set sitting out in a particularly hot country; another gets poked by a robot arm to test its moving parts. May says he doesn’t keep track of “drafts” because each set is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">Ship of Theseus</a>, the same design constantly evolving as pieces are swapped out to satisfy Lego’s standards.

		In the case of the Lego Polaroid, one particular challenge kept May and his colleagues swapping out parts: a request from the CEO of Polaroid himself.&nbsp;
</p>


					<p>
		When Lego came calling, Polaroid CEO Oskar Smolokowski didn’t hesitate. “I’m a (casual) Lego fan building a few sets a year so it wasn’t really a decision I had to think about!” he tells me via email. He accepted Lego’s offer almost on the spot, he says, while dodging my question about how much Lego did or didn’t pay for the license. “We didn’t feel the need to negotiate anything <span> it felt fair and win-win to us,” he writes.</span>
</p>


					<p>
		But Polaroid’s CEO did have one ask: he wanted the Lego Polaroid’s big red shutter button to <em>do</em> <em>something</em>. “I really wanted the camera to be as much of a camera as possible,” he recalls, and the CEO brought up this idea in the very first Lego / Polaroid kickoff meeting, remembers Scott.

		Lego wasn’t quite ready to commit to that. “I said yeah… we can look into it?” Scott recalls. Marc’s design could already eject a photo by turning a dial, and Lego had already successfully replicated that. The dial would definitely be Plan B.
</p>


					<p>
		But Scott decided to challenge May, who had previously worked on <a href="https://youtu.be/HRrHf57TMa8?si=Jga7xnV53wVzDuIi&amp;t=134">the moving Lego Typewriter</a>, to make the button work. With help from other teams that specialize in Lego’s mechanism-friendly Technic bricks, they landed on using a pair of tiny rubber bands connected to a sliding arm to eject the photo.&nbsp;
</p>


						</div>
						
						<div>
					<p>
		“It definitely didn’t work the first time,” says Scott. “I don’t know how many versions James went through.” They had to tinker with tiny details to make the mechanism work — making the contraption half a Lego plate thicker here or moving it over by one brick’s width. “A lot of it came down to nuances,” says Scott, “and all these subtleties you wouldn’t necessarily think of like which bricks are better at <em>stopping</em> it from firing out.”
</p>


					<p>
		In the end, the team attached the shutter button to an internal lever that, when pushed, raises an internal tooth, which releases a spring-loaded carriage that pushes the photo out with a satisfying <em>chonk</em> each time.
</p>


					<p>
		“Everyone came together to make this happen, and it’s so much better,” says Scott, adding that colleagues were wowed by the action (and sound) when they came by.
</p>


					<p>
		They also had to make sure the button worked no matter how many times someone pressed it. “A lot of the feedback we got was that the function just isn’t triggering after several hundred or several thousand times, it’s failing,” he adds. The function department even rigged up a robot to simulate pushing the shutter button tens of thousands of times — one which, I’m unreasonably pleased to say, uses Lego to test Lego:

		The other half of the Polaroid button challenge: figuring out how to create a Polaroid-like “picture” worthy of being ejected from the model. Originally, they tried a flat tile like Marc did but decided it wasn’t right.&nbsp;
</p>


					<p>
		“It looked Lego, it felt Lego, but it didn’t feel like a Polaroid photo because you want it to be thin; it also meant we couldn’t print on the back because you need the tube side; it caused a lot of issues in production because of warping,” says Scott.&nbsp;
</p>


					<p>
		But Lego’s textile department came to the rescue: “We found this card, could we use this for anything?” Scott remembers them asking. It was a thin sheet of matte polypropylene plastic — a “foil” — that had only been used a couple of times before in Lego sets, most prominently <a href="https://jaysbrickblog.com/reviews/review-lego-80109-lunar-new-year-ice-festival/#:~:text=this%20photobooth%20for%20minifigures">in this Chinese Lunar New Year Ice Festival photobooth</a> where minifigures can pop their heads through. It was flexible (though you can’t <em>quite</em> “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/ptech/02/17/polaroid.warns.reut/">shake it like a Polaroid picture</a>”), and it could be easily printed on both sides.&nbsp;
</p>


					<p>
		So, Lego graphics designer Matthew Parsons, who typically works for the Lego City team, embedded himself in the company’s textile department to help figure out the foils. A photographer himself, he jumped at the chance to be part of the Polaroid project, and he designed the three Easter egg photocards that come in every box.
</p>


					<p>
		Lego got one of the images, choosing to depict the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_House_(Billund)">Lego House</a>; Polaroid chose an iconic photo of its founder, Edwin Land; and Marc decided to thank his inspirations: the city of La Rochelle, France, where he cultivated his love of Lego and first prototyped the set, and his sister Mia, whose instant photography hobby brought him the idea. You can see some of Parsons’ sketches in our embedded gallery.
</p>


					<p>
		One of the last challenges was safety. Unlike actual Polaroids, the foils have rounded corners rather than sharp points. But even then, Lego’s safety department had to continually test the launcher during the monthslong project to ensure <em>other </em>unspecified objects couldn’t be dangerously blasted. With just a few weeks left in the schedule, they told the team they’d found one more undesirable object that someone could potentially launch out of the camera. “So that was another week of testing and building,” Scott says.
</p>


					<p>
		The final design ensures four Lego studs barely brush against the photo every time it ejects thanks to two sets of locking hinges that hold them at just the right angle. Inclined slopes on the edge of the film slot make the photo curve slightly upward as it ejects, too. Put it all together, press the button, and — <em>chonk</em> — the photo extends just far enough for you to easily grab, almost exactly an inch, instead of shooting all the way out.

		If you’ve ever used an old Polaroid camera, you know that photos tend to pop out quite a bit more than an inch, accompanied by a stretchy black film to slow their roll. It’s not the only way the Lego Polaroid diverges from the real thing, of course. You won’t find the OneStep SX-70’s trademark camera strap, or the film bay’s stickers with the manufacturer’s warranty support telephone number, or an optional green button that shipped in some markets, things Marc says he asked for when they solicited his input but says understandably didn’t make the cut.&nbsp;
</p>


					<p>
		(He also says he would have preferred a smooth, tiled back instead of studs — but Lego did try that, and both Polaroid and Lego agreed they preferred the studded look. And you can swap the “OneStep” sticker for a “1000” sticker, which is how some versions looked.)
</p>


					<p>
		Overall, I’m wildly impressed by the result. I bought the actual 1977 camera over a year ago just because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/25/23423120/lego-polaroid-land-camera-sx-70-replica-film-ideas">I knew this set was coming</a>, and I sometimes mistake one for the other on my office shelf. The size, shapes, and weight are incredibly close — both weigh approximately one pound, with the Lego set’s nose (and lens) mostly just protruding a little bit more than the actual camera. The body is also a tad narrower.&nbsp;

		There actually is a substantial nod to the missing camera strap on the back of the set, too, with openings for a strap cleverly sculpted by the gap in <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=39613">heart-shaped Lego plates</a> — ones that meld into the camera’s smooth corners thanks to a semi-advanced build technique. (If you’re a big Lego fan, you’ll be familiar with the phrase “Studs Not On Top.”) The film bay eject lever, film counter, and flash hot shoe are all represented with gaps or bulges, too, and the mechanism inside the black-and-white shell is a hidden rainbow of color, using all the same hues as the rainbow stripe up front. 
</p>


					<p>
		(It inspired me to hunt down a copy of the classic rainbow stripe for the right rail of this <em>Verge</em> story, in fact — Polaroid doesn’t really use the deep pink color anymore, and they had to dig it up at my request.)
</p>


					<p>
		The Lego team even splurged on a custom red plate with a white edge to represent Polaroid’s shutter button, plus two printed tiles for the brick-built film pack that reads “Polaroid” and “Time-Zero Supercolor SX-70 Land Film.”
</p>


					<p>
		I haven’t yet gotten to the single most satisfying step in the build, the one Lego saves for last: the iconic Polaroid rainbow stripe on this camera isn’t a sticker. It’s a sideways stack of 1x6 plates and <a href="https://www.newelementary.com/2018/12/lego-35459-1x3-inverted-tile-hole.html">1x3 inverted hole tiles</a> in colors that match up almost perfectly to Polaroid’s original hues, held together by thin Lego pipes. It’s great — but it made me wonder why Lego still does use some other stickers in this design.
</p>


					<p>
		Many Lego fans are vocal about their preference for printed parts over stickers, and there’s always annoyance when a set aimed at adults uses any stickers at all. Here, your “Polaroid Land Camera,” “OneStep” or “1000,” and the exposure dial’s white and black EV marks are all sticky labels, not printed tiles.

					<p>
		To my great surprise, Scott was willing to explain how Lego makes those kinds of choices.
</p>


					<p>
		Lego’s picker system requires each printed piece to have its own unique storage bin, so rather than continually opening more warehouses, Lego limits how many custom parts designers can introduce each year.&nbsp;
</p>


					<p>
		“We can’t make everything decorated. We can’t change every brick into every color,” Scott says. “Otherwise the portfolio would just explode in complexity, so we have teams that manage the complexity level.”&nbsp;
</p>


					<p>
		And those teams came up with one simple idea to stem the tide of complexity: “frames.”&nbsp;
</p>


					<p>
		Want a part in a different color? That costs designers a frame. A new piece? Spend some frames. Bring back an old out-of-print piece? That’s a frame, too. Every year, design leads like Scott are given a limited number of frames that they can spend on their entire portfolio for physical pieces that aren’t readily at hand. “If I have five products or 10 products coming out, I need to allocate where those frames go,” says Scott.&nbsp;
</p>


						</div>
						
						<div>
					<p>
		Doing so is “a bit of a puzzle” to figure out which sets will need lots of frames — the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23909975/lego-animal-crossing-pictures-price-release-date-sets">new <em>Animal Crossing</em> sets</a> with their custom minifigures probably ate a few — and which ones can be built mostly out of preexisting parts.&nbsp;
</p>


					<p>
		Designers also try to save frames by sharing brand-new bricks with other teams, giving them a heads-up that they might come in handy for other sets, too. Some of that happens automatically: “When someone puts in an order for a particular color change, we can see it showing up in the library of digital bricks,” says Scott.

		Some of it is designers intentionally pooling their resources: “If Ninjago are making something we could use, we kind of have a dialogue and say, ‘Oh, we can use this as well, that would be great, so maybe we need to get you a frame or something to share it.’” 
</p>


					<p>
		Designers always want more frames for their sets, May says. But he explains those constraints are just part of the process. When designers don’t have as many frames as they’d like, they have to get creative — just like any other Lego fan.&nbsp;
</p>


					<p>
		For the Lego Polaroid, the team spent a frame on the red and white shutter button — which could now appear in any number of other sets — and two frames for the decorations on the film pack, which are obviously exclusive to Polaroid. Scott planned to spend frames on ejecting photos, too: internally, he and his fellow designers were excited about making a new 8x6 printed photo tile, until the foils came along.
</p>


					<p>
		Polaroid’s CEO remembers one more thing that didn’t make the cut: “I think the only other thing I may have mentioned was a little Edwin Land figure,” he says, referencing the founder of Polaroid. “That would’ve been awesome.” Instead, Land is on one of the three photocards that come with the set.

		“Just thinking about the fact that because I submitted an idea like a year and a half ago, that now so many people in the community are going to have a Lego Polaroid set — it’s just insane,” says Marc.
</p>


					<p>
		I get the sense, though, that the process wasn’t <em>entirely</em> a dream come true. Lego mostly took his idea and ran with it. It never flew him to Denmark to meet the designers in person, something he says he would have loved, nor did it ship him prototypes during the process; he got to see it on a video call. He assured me it wasn’t a big deal — he’ll get 10 free copies after all.&nbsp;
</p>


					<p>
		Lego demands a high level of secrecy, too: he felt he couldn’t tell his own Lego-loving brother for <em>months</em>. Or his mom. Or his sister Mia, who may not quite know what she’s gotten into. “Like, I don’t think she understands that she’s going to be in the Lego set, you know, mass-produced,” says Marc. (He says he did ask permission to “steal her likeness,” and she was “totally cool” with it hypothetically being in Lego.)
</p>


					<p>
		But judging by their Lego Ideas page, Marc and his brother Nick don’t seem to have been put off one bit. In September, their “Minibrick Productions” submitted a brick-built version of <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/7a6d8d85-093d-4f6c-ab7f-48b405115d60/official_comments#content_nav_tabs">the <em>Interstellar</em> space shuttle</a> that took just weeks to become a Lego staff pick and has crossed 6,000 votes. <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/53056645-ba8d-4a35-a219-77d30aa6f733">A set based on Blackpink’s music video for “Lovesick Girls”</a> hit 5,000 votes in August.
</p>


					<p>
		If you’re looking to follow in their footsteps with a Lego set of your own, here’s Marc’s advice: design it like a product you’d want to sell. “Showcase its play features like you’d showcase a final product.” And — though this could be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivorship bias</a> — he says you have to keep trying, pointing to his many previous rejections as evidence.&nbsp;
</p>


					<p>
		“I think you really just have to keep going and continue with that spark of hope, that maybe one of your future projects will become an actual set.”

				</div>

						<main id="main">
				<div id="content">
					<!-- maths detected --><article><div><p>I’m a responsible web designer, and as such, since WordPress (finally) accepts media uploads of <code>image/webp</code> MIME type and since <strong>all</strong> <a href="https://caniuse.com/webp">web browsers</a> newer than september 2020 (even Apple Safari \o/) can display it, I have been moving my <a href="https://photo.aurelienpierre.com/portfolio">photos library</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP">WebP</a>. After all, when you create content, the least you can do is to also provide the smoothest user experience around it.</p>

<p>WebP falls close to magical : lookie those file weights ! <a href="https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/avif-webp-quality-settings/">15% savings</a> compared to JPEG at same quality ! What are we waiting for ? Google even claims <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/webp_study">25-34% smaller</a>.</p>

<p>There are dozens of WordPress plugins allowing you to convert your old media library on-the-fly, most of them operating as SaaS (Shit as a Software) and doing the conversion on their own servers, which entitles them to make you pay a ridiculous amount for it, <a href="https://imagify.io/">one of them</a> I’m very unhappy to have actually paid (something about sparing time, which actually led to losing time AND money). All of them claim that their “aggressive” compression factor is safe for 99 % of your pictures.</p>

<p>The most technical ones will go as far as telling you that WebP quality greater than <code>lossy 80</code> is useless for most pictures, sustaining their claim with a glorious <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/webmproject.org/forum/#!topic/webp-discuss/0GmxDmlexek">Google logo</a> encoded at various rates. Because everyone knows shooting logos is the bread and butter of every photographer, especially the Adobe Stock ones. Also, logos have their gradients following an hyper-laplacian distribution like any other natural image<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a></sup>. Or maybe not. Who cares about gradients stats anyway ? We are only talking about 2D compression heuristics with entropy and high-frequencies thresholding, after all.</p>

<p>So, while I may have lost all respect for coding monkeys turned into image dudes just because a position opened (and everyone loves pics, right ? They are fun and much easier on the brain than words), especially the internet image dudes, I still fall every time for that silly assumption:&nbsp;people who are supposed to know, actually know. Years pass, I&nbsp;don’t learn : I&nbsp;read docs, I&nbsp;do what they say, I discover it doesn’t work as promised, only then I remember those guys don’t know shit about images. And here I am, loosing faith in humanity one wrong expert at a time.</p>

<p>In my great silliness, I set the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/webp-express/">third and last plugin I&nbsp;tried</a> to the advised <code>lossy 80</code> quality and trigger the batch conversion. I&nbsp;have relative faith in it since it uses server-side <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphicsMagick">GraphicsMagic</a> instead of the unfortunate PHP shitstack (GD, Gmagick and the likes) or the laggy HTTP-error connection-timed-out DNS-said-not-today please-retry-later SaaS nonsense.</p>

<p>Everything goes well, until this happens…</p>

<p><a href="https://photo.aurelienpierre.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/03-WEB-800x971.webp"><img decoding="async" data-orig-src="https://photo.aurelienpierre.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/03-WEB-800x971.webp" alt="" src="https://photo.aurelienpierre.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/03-WEB-800x971.webp"></a></p>

<p>To the non-educated eye, this might look ok, but for a photographer it’s not, and for several reasons. See the posterized ring in the background ? First of all, it’s not graceful, but then it has nothing to do there. This comes from a 16 bits scan of an Ilford Delta 400 film shot with a Mamiya RB 67, that is old school analog medium format at 6×7 cm. The silver halide crystals of the Delta 400 emulsion act as a natural dithering which makes high-frequency compressions more difficult and therefore prevent posterization in smooth areas. So, for any compression algo, managing to posterize a Delta 400 scan is a feat of the wrong kind.</p>

<p>Look at the original JPEG at quality 85 :</p>

<p><a href="https://photo.aurelienpierre.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/03-WEB-800x971.jpg"><img decoding="async" data-orig-src="https://photo.aurelienpierre.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/03-WEB-800x971.jpg" alt="" src="https://photo.aurelienpierre.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/03-WEB-800x971.jpg"></a></p>

<p>It’s not 100 % clean either, but much better. Granted, this is WebP re-encoding of an already lossy compressed JPEG, so we stack 2 steps of destructive compression. <strong>But</strong> this is what <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Google Page Speed insights</a> encourage you to do and what a shitload of plugins enable you to do, while pretending it’s completely safe. <strong>It’s not.</strong></p>

<p>I have seen a similar effect in other similar pictures : always pictures with large, smooth, gradients in the background, which happens a lot when some punctual-ish light falls off a wall. That’s not something accidental, smooth fall-off are actively built by photographers to create organic-looking backgrounds with just enough of texture to not get boring, yet discrete enough to not draw attention off the foreground/subject.</p>

<p>So, I wondered how bad it was for actual raw photos encoded straight in darktable. Meaning just one step of encoding. Meaning real WebP quality comparison for real-life studio head-shots, which are one of the last things customers are willing to pay actual photographers to do (instead of snapping their own iPhone). Meaning real money for real professionals. Meaning something the image coding douchebags may have not foreseen, because it doesn’t happen in VS Code (or Vim, for that matter).</p>

<p>Let’s start. The following 2 images use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering">Floyd-Steinberg dithering</a> in 8 bits, with lossy compression set at 90 for both JPEG and WebP (remember, the experts recommend 80 for WebP). All images below, saved in WebP, use the “photo” image hint of Jeroen Oom’s <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/webp/index.html">libwebp</a> 1.2.1. <em>Click on images to open the full-size version, or better : right-click and open them in a new tab</em></p>

<p>JPEG 85 and WebP 90 both fail the test, looking like shit. But WebP looks more like shit : the contrast in posterized rings is higher. <strong>And</strong> we are already 10 % above the recommended quality that “should fit 99 % of pictures”. JPEG 90 looks ok though, but it’s a lot heavier.</p>

<p>So, let’s try something else, now : going lossless WebP. That should be our ground truth of WebP supremacy.</p>

<p>So, the WebP quality is now clean, but I’m not impressed with the weight, especially since you need a really good look to distinguish it from JPEG 90, which weighs about a third of that, and it’s forensically similar to JPEG 95, which is a bit more than half. Ooops.</p>

<p>Let’s try something else : redo it, but instead of the light Floyd-Steinberg dithering, use heavier random noise at -48 dB PSNR. That’s a very high PSNR, meaning it should be almost unnoticeable to human eyes but should give an harder time to the high-frequency filtering which is most of the trick behind image compressing.</p>

<p>The WebP is still more prone to posterization. So, I wondered what the WebP quality was that would be as smooth as the JPEG 85 with -48 dB of noise (which was pretty damn smooth). The answer is somewhere between 95 and 96, even though it’s hard to make an equivalence since the quality and texture of the artifacts differ.</p>

<p>Yeah, you read it. WebP is actually 39 % heavier than JPEG 85 plus noise for a similar-ish look on this difficult picture, and still not totally as smooth as the JPEG (there is still a tiny bit of ringing). It’s also 30 % heavier than JPEG 90 with simple Floyd-Steinberg dithering.</p>

<p>So, what do we take from that ?</p>

<p>First, at similar visual quality and for photographs, WebP is not lighter than JPEG, it’s actually the opposite. All the Google claims rely on measuring the average SSIM and average bit weight over a dataset of images. Call me crazy, but I don’t give a shit about averages. For a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">gaussian "normal" process</a>, probabilities say half of your sample will be above and half will be below the average (which is also the median in a gaussian distribution). If we designed cars for the average load they would have to sustain, it means we would kill about half of the customers. Instead, we design cars for the worst foreseeable scenario, add a safety factor on top, and they still kill a fair amount of them, but a lot fewer than in the past. Most probabilistic distributions are close to gaussian, so the assumption that average = median ± a little something is fair. Also the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_Similarity">SSIM</a> metric is an incomplete, biased, controverted metric of image similarity that takes no actual perceptual metric into account<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">[2]</a></sup>, it’s just averages, variances and covariances, meaning it is barely a pattern recognition scheme from a machine perspective.</p>

<p>As a photographer, I&nbsp;care about robustness of the visual output. Which means, as a designer, designing for the worst possible image and taking numerical metrics with a grain of salt. And that whole WebP hype is unjustified, in this regard. It surely performs well in well chosen examples, no doubt. The question is : what happens when it doesn’t ? I can’t fine-tune the WebP quality for each individual image on my website, that’s time consuming and WordPress doesn’t even allow that. I can’t have a portfolio of pictures with even 25 % posterized backgrounds either, the whole point of a portfolio is to showcase your skills and results, not to take a wild guess on the compression performance of your image backend. Average won’t do, it’s simply not good enough. And in setting the weight vs. quality ratio, the nature of the induced artifacts matters perhaps more than the norm of the deviation. We can tolerate higher variance in random noise than in patterned blotches.</p>

<p>Second, I don’t know why all the techies around have a huge kink over sharpness, but the most challenging situations I&nbsp;have faced as a photographer were with smooth gradients. Or more accurately, gradients that should have been smooth and weren’t in the output. So there is a real issue with the design priorities of image algos from tech guys who clearly lack historical and artistic background, and don’t talk to artists, who anyway have largely decided that they were above science, maths and other menial materialistic concerns. Most test pictures for WebP compression showcase sharp scenes with large depth of field, so lots of details, aka high-frequencies, which have zero chance of posterization and are not the pain point of such algorithms. Lack of sharpness has never destroyed a picture, on the contrary. Painters took as much trouble to render atmospheric haze and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sfumato">sfumato</a></em> as photographers take now to revert them. But having a staircase in place of a smooth vignette surely <strong>is</strong> damaging to the picture in an unacceptable way.</p>

<p>Third, big shout-out to all the morons, idiots, douchebags and monkeys who make big claims all around on matters they don’t nearly understand. Why the big words ? I have been told on my previous article that I&nbsp;was too heavy on insults… Well, we live in a time where time is the ultimate luxury, and the idiots-who-should-know-but-didn’t are not only causing damages, they also cost money and time, and I really think they should be punished for this. You can refund money, you can’t refund time. Thing is, as technologies are “improving”, people don’t get more free time because the work doesn’t get any easier. Instead, the tools become more complex and the customer expect more as the tools get faster, meaning workers have as much work as before, only with more complex toolkits. So, actually, better tech doesn’t mean less or easier work for the actual workers, it may just mean better result if it is actually better tech, which, in this case, it is not. The proof has been made here that WebP is simply not robust enough for image makers, regardless of its average performance, if lesser (or even similar) data bandwidth is the ultimate goal. The test done here is simple enough to have been done by anyone much earlier, provided they used image datasets from actual photographers.</p>

<p>Image-making is not just a vocational part-time activity for bored upper-class or retired citizen with enough money to buy 10 k€ camera systems and do mostly nothing out of them. Some people rely on that to make a living. And they are already in a precarious enough situation (even before COVID… how many newspapers still had a photo staff in 2015 ?) to not take more shit from the people who pretend to help them, when they do the opposite. I have the ability to double-check the stupid shit I read here and there, but the large majority of visual artists don’t and will take the word of “experts” for truth even though it contradicts facts they have witnessed themselves for years.</p>

<p>The Google monkeys at Page Speed are idiots when they advise you to move all your content to WebP. Also they are dishonest since they commited it themselves, so they are judge and party. The Google monkeys who said WebP has lower weight at similar average SSIM say nothing because neither the SSIM nor the average are meaningful : none is robust enough, at best it’s a 50⁄50 % of satisfying/unacceptable outcome. The WordPress plugins monkeys are idiots when they advise and tool you up to convert already lossy JPEGs to WebP. Oh, they probably make all their claims in good faith, the problem is they didn’t see the problems, precisely. And it’s super difficult to argue with people who don’t — literally — see the problems because it’s their bad eyes against your experience, and since people believe only what they see, you are screwed. But then, a lot of lower-tier websites and blog will repeat everything coming from these “trustable” sources, doing even more damage. I have personally lost about a full working week in the past 6 months over that whole WebP migration madness and thanks to all these fake news, to make it work across URL rewriting and CDN redirections, and then to understand why it looked so bad at the end.</p>

<p>Finally, WebP is badly designed. Being necessarily RGB or RGBalpha, there is no way to save a monochrome grey image on single channel. We see that all the posterization here is made worse by magenta and green rings which come solely from the chroma subsampling. With a purely monochrome format saved on a single channel, you don’t introduce any additional chroma shift. It’s as bad as JPEG, but it could have been fixed. That’s what AVIF did, at least, but it won’t be a technical reality for at least another decade.</p>

<p>How do we solve that ?</p>

<ol>
<li>Stick to JPEG at 90 quality (or at least 85) if images matter to you, e.g. if you are a visual artist. If images are pretty decorations for your textual content, it doesn’t matter.</li>
<li>Always add dithering and/or a tiny bit of noise in your images, just to be sure smooth gradients will stay smooth no matter the amount of damage they will take from stupid websites recompressions.</li>
<li>Don’t convert your old JPEG to WebP even if every idiot around tells you to, unless you find the images shown above remotely acceptable.</li>
<li>Serve your images from a fast <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CDN">CDN</a>, use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images">responsive image sizes</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading">image lazy loading</a> to improve loading speed and perceived responsiveness from the user/client side, but there is not much more you can do without damaging the quality of your images.</li>
<li>Avoid all the SaaS ways of converting your images on another server. On paper, they sound great because they relieve your own server from the conversion load, which is good on mutualized hostings. Except they cost, don’t disclose the actual quality factor they use, and don’t work in lots of cases (HTTP connections errors everywhere, especially if you have hardened WordPress with a security plugin). You would be better off with a better hosting and running conversions on your server straight with Image Magick/Graphics Magick (not the PHP&nbsp;interfaces, but directly the server program). There is a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/imagemagick-engine/">WordPress plugin</a> that does just that.</li>
<li>Devs and techs really need to pull their head out of their arses and start discussing with actual artists to understand their challenges and priorities.</li>
<li>Devs and techs really need to get a grasp at basic probabilities because… average, really ?</li>
<li>We really need people able to have one foot in the tech world and the other in the art world, and being able to discuss with both worlds, because having them in two separate bubbles is damaging on a large scale right now, and I don’t see it improving.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The Fourier Transform is one of deepest insights ever made. Unfortunately, the meaning is buried within dense equations:</p>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/45c088dbb767150fc0bacfeb49dd49e5.png" width="189" height="54" alt="\displaystyle{X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \cdot e^{-i 2 \pi k n / N}}"></p>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/faeb9c5bf2e60add63ae4a70b293c7b4.png" width="202" height="54" alt="\displaystyle{x_n = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_k \cdot e^{i 2 \pi k n / N}}"></p>
<p>Yikes. Rather than jumping into the symbols, let's experience the key idea firsthand. Here's a plain-English metaphor:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What does the Fourier Transform do?</strong> Given a smoothie, it finds the recipe.</li>
<li><strong>How?</strong> Run the smoothie through filters to extract each ingredient.</li>
<li><strong>Why?</strong> Recipes are easier to analyze, compare, and modify than the smoothie itself.</li>
<li><strong>How do we get the smoothie back?</strong> Blend the ingredients.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the "math English" version of the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Fourier Transform takes a time-based pattern, measures every possible cycle, and returns the overall "cycle recipe" (the amplitude, offset, &amp; rotation speed for every cycle that was found).</li>
</ul>
<p>Time for the equations? No! Let's get our hands dirty and <em>experience</em> how any pattern can be built with cycles, with live simulations.</p>
<p>If all goes well, we'll have an aha! moment and intuitively realize why the Fourier Transform is possible. We'll save the detailed math analysis for the follow-up.</p>
<p>This isn't a force-march through the equations, it's the casual stroll I wish I had. Onward!</p>

<h2>From Smoothie to Recipe</h2>
<p>A math transformation is a change of perspective. We change our notion of quantity from "single items" (lines in the sand, tally system) to "groups of 10" (decimal) depending on what we're counting. Scoring a game? Tally it up. Multiplying? Decimals, please.</p>
<p>The Fourier Transform changes our perspective from consumer to producer, turning <em>What do I have?</em> into <em>How was it made?</em></p>
<p>In other words: given a smoothie, let's find the recipe.</p>
<p>Why? Well, recipes are great descriptions of drinks. You wouldn't share a drop-by-drop analysis, you'd say "I had an orange/banana smoothie". A recipe is more easily categorized, compared, and modified than the object itself.</p>
<p>So... given a smoothie, how do we find the recipe?</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/images/smoothie-to-recipe-20121030-223058.png.webp" type="image/webp"><img decoding="async" alt="fourier transform analogy smoothie to recipe" src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/images/smoothie-to-recipe-20121030-223058.png" height="300"></picture></p>
<p>Well, imagine you had a few filters lying around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pour through the "banana" filter. 1 oz of bananas are extracted.</li>
<li>Pour through the "orange" filter. 2 oz of oranges.</li>
<li>Pour through the "milk" filter. 3 oz of milk.</li>
<li>Pour through the "water" filter. 3 oz of water.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can reverse-engineer the recipe by filtering each ingredient. The catch?</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Filters must be independent</strong>. The banana filter needs to capture bananas, and nothing else. Adding more oranges should never affect the banana reading.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Filters must be complete</strong>. We won't get the real recipe if we leave out a filter ("There were mangoes too!"). Our collection of filters must catch every possible ingredient.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ingredients must be combine-able</strong>. Smoothies can be separated and re-combined without issue (A cookie? Not so much. Who wants crumbs?). The ingredients, when separated and combined in any order, must make the same result.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>See The World As Cycles</h2>
<p>The Fourier Transform takes a specific viewpoint: <strong>What if any signal could be filtered into a bunch of circular paths?</strong></p>
<p>Whoa. This concept is mind-blowing, and poor Joseph Fourier had his idea rejected at first. (<em>Really Joe, even a staircase pattern can be made from circles?</em>)</p>
<p>And despite <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_history_of_fourier_series">decades of debate</a> in the math community, we expect students to internalize the idea without issue. Ugh. Let's walk through the intuition.</p>
<p>The Fourier Transform finds the recipe for a signal, like our smoothie process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with a time-based signal</li>
<li>Apply filters to measure each possible "circular ingredient"</li>
<li>Collect the full recipe, listing the amount of each "circular ingredient"</li>
</ul>
<p>Stop. Here's where most tutorials excitedly throw engineering applications at your face. Don't get scared; think of the examples as "Wow, we're finally seeing the source code (DNA) behind previously confusing ideas".</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If earthquake vibrations can be separated into "ingredients" (vibrations of different speeds &amp; amplitudes), buildings can be designed to avoid interacting with the strongest ones.</p></li>
<li><p>If sound waves can be separated into ingredients (bass and treble frequencies), we can boost the parts we care about, and hide the ones we don't. The crackle of random noise can be removed. Maybe similar "sound recipes" can be compared (music recognition services compare recipes, not the raw audio clips).</p></li>
<li><p>If computer data can be represented with oscillating patterns, perhaps the least-important ones can be ignored. This "lossy compression" can drastically shrink file sizes (and why JPEG and MP3 files are much smaller than raw .bmp or .wav files).</p></li>
<li><p>If a radio wave is our signal, we can use filters to listen to a particular channel. In the smoothie world, imagine each person paid attention to a different ingredient: Adam looks for apples, Bob looks for bananas, and Charlie gets cauliflower (sorry bud).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Fourier Transform is useful in engineering, sure, but it's a metaphor about finding the root causes behind an observed effect.</p>
<h2>Think With Circles, Not Just Sinusoids</h2>
<p>One of my giant confusions was separating the definitions of "sinusoid" and "circle".</p>
<ul>
<li>A "sinusoid" is a specific back-and-forth pattern (a <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-understanding-of-sine-waves/">sine</a> or cosine wave), and 99% of the time, it refers to motion in one dimension.</li>
<li>A "circle" is a round, 2d pattern you probably know. If you enjoy using 10-dollar words to describe 10-cent ideas, you might call a circular path a "complex sinusoid".</li>
</ul>
<p>Labeling a circular path as a "complex sinusoid" is like describing a word as a "multi-letter". You zoomed into the wrong level of detail. Words are about concepts, not the letters they can be split into!</p>
<p>The Fourier Transform is about circular paths (not 1-d sinusoids) and <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-understanding-of-eulers-formula/">Euler's formula</a> is a clever way to generate one:</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/euler/equal_paths.png.webp" type="image/webp"><img decoding="async" src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/euler/equal_paths.png" alt="euler path"></picture></p>
<p>Must we use imaginary exponents to move in a circle? Nope. But it's convenient and compact. And sure, we can describe our path as coordinated motion in two dimensions (real and imaginary), but don't forget the big picture: we're just moving in a circle.</p>
<h2>Following Circular Paths</h2>
<p>Let's say we're chatting on the phone and, like usual, I want us to draw the same circle simultaneously. (<em>You promised!</em>) What should I say?</p>
<ul>
<li>How big is the circle? (Amplitude, i.e. size of radius)</li>
<li>How fast do we draw it? (Frequency. 1 circle/second is a frequency of 1 Hertz (Hz) or 2*pi radians/sec)</li>
<li>Where do we start? (Phase angle, where 0 degrees is the x-axis)</li>
</ul>
<p>I could say "2-inch radius, start at 45 degrees, 1 circle per second, go!". After half a second, we should each be pointing to: starting point + amount traveled = 45 + 180 = 225 degrees (on a 2-inch circle).</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/images/circular-path-parameters-20121201-203317.png.webp" type="image/webp"><img decoding="async" alt="circular path with parameters" src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/images/circular-path-parameters-20121201-203317.png" width="500"></picture></p>
<p>Every circular path needs a size, speed, and starting angle (amplitude/frequency/phase). We can even combine paths: imagine tiny motorcars, driving in circles at different speeds.</p>
<p>The combined position of <em>all the cycles</em> is our signal, just like the combined flavor of <em>all the ingredients</em> is our smoothie.</p>
<p>Here's a simulation of a basic circular path:</p>

<p>(Based on <a href="http://treeblurb.com/dev_math/sin_canv00.html">this animation</a>, here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/kazad/8bb682da198db597558c">the source code</a>. Modern browser required. Click the graph to pause/unpause.)</p>
<p>The magnitude of each cycle is listed in order, starting at 0Hz. Cycles <code>[0 1]</code> means</p>
<ul>
<li>0 amplitude for the 0Hz cycle (0Hz = a constant cycle, stuck on the x-axis at zero degrees)</li>
<li>1 amplitude for the 1Hz cycle (completes 1 cycle per time interval)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the tricky part:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The blue graph measures the <em>real part</em> of the cycle</strong>. Another lovely math confusion: the real axis of the circle, which is usually horizontal, has its magnitude shown on the vertical axis. You can mentally rotate the circle 90 degrees if you like.</li>
<li><strong>The time points are spaced at the fastest frequency</strong>. A 1Hz signal needs 2 time points for a start and stop (a single data point doesn't have a frequency). The time values <code>[1 -1]</code> shows the amplitude at these equally-spaced intervals.</li>
</ul>
<p>With me? <code>[0 1]</code> is a pure 1Hz cycle.</p>
<p>Now let's add a 2Hz cycle to the mix. <code>[0 1 1]</code> means "Nothing at 0Hz, 1Hz of amplitude 1, 2Hz of amplitude 1":</p>

<p>Whoa. The little motorcars are getting wild: the green lines are the 1Hz and 2Hz cycles, and the blue line is the combined result. Try toggling the green checkbox to see the final result clearly. The combined "flavor" is a sway that starts at the max and dips low for the rest of the interval.</p>
<p>The yellow dots are when we actually measure the signal. With 3 cycles defined (0Hz, 1Hz, 2Hz), each dot is 1/3 of the way through the signal. In this case, cycles <code>[0 1 1]</code> generate the time values <code>[2 -1 -1]</code>, which starts at the max (2) and dips low (-1).</p>
<p>Oh! We can't forget phase, the starting angle! Use <code>magnitude:angle</code> to set the phase. So <code>[0 1:45]</code> is a 1Hz cycle that starts at 45 degrees:</p>

<p>This is a shifted version of <code>[0 1]</code>. On the time side we get <code>[.7 -.7]</code> instead of <code>[1 -1]</code>, because our cycle isn't exactly lined up with our measuring intervals, which are still at the halfway point (this could be desired!).</p>
<p><strong>The Fourier Transform finds the set of cycle speeds, amplitudes and phases to match any time signal.</strong></p>
<p>Our signal becomes an abstract notion that we consider as "observations in the time domain" or "ingredients in the frequency domain".</p>
<p>Enough talk: try it out! In the simulator, type any time or cycle pattern you'd like to see. If it's time points, you'll get a collection of cycles (that combine into a "wave") that matches your desired points.</p>
<p><a href="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/images/time-patterns-20121205-164541.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<picture><source srcset="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/images/time-patterns-20121205-164541.png.webp" type="image/webp"><img decoding="async" alt="fourier transform examples" src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/images/time-patterns-20121205-164541.png" width="550px"></picture></a></p>
<p>But… doesn't the combined wave have strange values between the yellow time intervals? Sure. But who's to say whether a signal travels in straight lines, or curves, or zips into other dimensions when we aren't measuring it? It behaves exactly as we need at the equally-spaced moments we asked for.</p>
<h2>Making A Spike In Time</h2>
<p>Can we make a spike in time, like <code>(4 0 0 0)</code>, using cycles? I'll use parentheses <code>()</code> for a sequence of time points, and brackets <code>[]</code> for a sequence of cycles.</p>
<p>Although the spike seems boring to us time-dwellers (<em>one data point, that's it?</em>), think about the complexity in the cycle world. Our cycle ingredients must start aligned (at the max value, 4) and then "explode outwards", each cycle with partners that cancel it in the future. Every remaining point is zero, which is a tricky balance with multiple cycles running around (we can't just "turn them off").</p>
<p>Let's walk through each time point:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At time 0, the first instant, every cycle ingredient is at its max. Ignoring the other time points, <code>(4 ? ? ?)</code> can be made from 4 cycles (0Hz 1Hz 2Hz 3Hz), each with a magnitude of 1 and phase of 0 (i.e., 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4).</p></li>
<li><p>At every future point (t = 1, 2, 3), the sum of all cycles must cancel.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the trick: when two cycles are on opposites sides of the circle (North &amp; South, East &amp; West, etc.) their combined position is zero (3 cycles can cancel if they're spread evenly at 0, 120, and 240 degrees).</p>
<p>Imagine a constellation of points moving around the circle. Here's the position of each cycle at every instant:</p>
<pre>Time 0 1 2 3 
------------
0Hz: 0 0 0 0 
1Hz: 0 1 2 3
2Hz: 0 2 0 2
3Hz: 0 3 2 1
</pre>
<p>Notice how the the 3Hz cycle starts at 0, gets to position 3, then position "6" (with only 4 positions, 6 <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/fun-with-modular-arithmetic/">modulo</a> 4 = 2), then position "9" (9 modulo 4 = 1).</p>
<p>When our cycle is 4 units long, cycle speeds a half-cycle apart (2 units) will either be lined up (difference of 0, 4, 8…) or on opposite sides (difference of 2, 6, 10…).</p>
<p>OK. Let's drill into each time point:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time 0: All cycles at their max (total of 4)</li>
<li>Time 1: 1Hz and 3Hz cancel (positions 1 &amp; 3 are opposites), 0Hz and 2Hz cancel as well. The net is 0.</li>
<li>Time 2: 0Hz and 2Hz line up at position 0, while 1Hz and 3Hz line up at position 2 (the opposite side). The total is still 0.</li>
<li>Time 3: 0Hz and 2Hz cancel. 1Hz and 3Hz cancel.</li>
<li>Time 4 (repeat of t=0): All cycles line up.</li>
</ul>
<p>The trick is having individual speeds cancel (0Hz vs 2Hz, 1Hz vs 3Hz), or having the lined-up pairs cancel (0Hz + 2Hz vs 1Hz + 3Hz).</p>
<p>When every cycle has equal power and 0 phase, we start aligned and cancel afterwards. (I don't have a nice proof yet -- any takers? -- but you can see it yourself. Try <code>[1 1]</code>, <code>[1 1 1]</code>, <code>[1 1 1 1]</code> and notice the signals we generate: <code>(2 0)</code>, <code>(3 0 0)</code>, <code>(4 0 0 0)</code>).</p>
<p>In my head, I label these signals as "time spikes": they have a value for a single instant, and are zero otherwise (the fancy name is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function">delta function</a>.)</p>
<p>Here's how I visualize the initial alignment, followed by a net cancellation:</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/images/fourier-interference-20121211-171719.png.webp" type="image/webp"><img decoding="async" alt="fourier transform constructive and destructive interference" src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/images/fourier-interference-20121211-171719.png" width="400px"></picture></p>
<h2>Moving The Time Spike</h2>
<p>Not everything happens at t=0. Can we change our spike to <code>(0 4 0 0)</code>?</p>
<p>It seems the cycle ingredients should be similar to <code>(4 0 0 0)</code>, but the cycles must align at t=1 (one second in the future). Here's where phase comes in.</p>
<p>Imagine a race with 4 runners. Normal races have everyone lined up at the starting line, the <code>(4 0 0 0)</code> time pattern. Boring.</p>
<p>What if we want everyone to <em>finish</em> at the same time? Easy. Just move people forward or backwards by the appropriate distance. Maybe granny can start 2 feet in front of the finish line, Usain Bolt can start 100m back, and they can cross the tape holding hands.</p>
<p>Phase shifts, the starting angle, are delays in the cycle universe. Here's how we adjust the starting position to delay every cycle 1 second:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 0Hz cycle doesn't move, so it's already aligned</li>
<li>A 1Hz cycle goes 1 revolution in the entire 4 seconds, so a 1-second delay is a quarter-turn. Phase shift it 90 degrees backwards (-90) and it gets to phase=0, the max value, at t=1.</li>
<li>A 2Hz cycle is twice as fast, so give it twice the angle to cover (-180 or 180 phase shift -- it's across the circle, either way).</li>
<li>A 3Hz cycle is 3x as fast, so give it 3x the distance to move (-270 or +90 phase shift)</li>
</ul>
<p>If time points <code>(4 0 0 0)</code> are made from cycles <code>[1 1 1 1]</code>, then time points <code>(0 4 0 0)</code> are made from <code>[1 1:-90 1:180 1:90]</code>. (Note: I'm using "1Hz", but I mean "1 cycle over the entire time period").</p>
<p>Whoa -- we're working out the cycles in our head!</p>
<p>The interference visualization is similar, except the alignment is at t=1.</p>

<p>Test your intuition: Can you make <code>(0 0 4 0)</code>, i.e. a 2-second delay? 0Hz has no phase. 1Hz has 180 degrees, 2Hz has 360 (aka 0), and 3Hz has 540 (aka 180), so it's <code>[1 1:180 1 1:180]</code>.</p>
<h2>Discovering The Full Transform</h2>
<p>The big insight: our signal is just a bunch of time spikes! If we merge the recipes for each time spike, we should get the recipe for the full signal.</p>
<p>The Fourier Transform builds the recipe frequency-by-frequency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate the full signal (a b c d) into "time spikes": (a 0 0 0) (0 b 0 0) (0 0 c 0) (0 0 0 d)</li>
<li>For any frequency (like 2Hz), the <em>tentative</em> recipe is "a/4 + b/4 + c/4 + d/4" (the amplitude of each spike is split among all frequencies)</li>
<li>Wait! We need to offset each spike with a phase delay (the angle for a "1 second delay" depends on the frequency).</li>
<li>Actual recipe for a frequency = a/4 (no offset) + b/4 (1 second offset) + c/4 (2 second offset) + d/4 (3 second offset).</li>
</ul>
<p>We can then loop through every frequency to get the full transform.</p>
<p>Here's the conversion from "math English" to full math:</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/images/fourier-explained-20121219-224649.png.webp" type="image/webp"><img decoding="async" alt="fourier transform plain english" src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/images/fourier-explained-20121219-224649.png" width="500px"></picture></p>
<p>A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>N = number of time samples we have</li>
<li>n = current sample we're considering (0 .. N-1)</li>
<li>x<sub>n</sub> = value of the signal at time n</li>
<li>k = current frequency we're considering (0 Hertz up to N-1 Hertz)</li>
<li>X<sub>k</sub> = amount of frequency k in the signal (amplitude and phase, a complex number)</li>
<li>The 1/N factor is usually moved to the <em>reverse transform</em> (going from frequencies back to time). This <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/58163/dft-why-are-the-definitions-for-inverse-and-forward-commonly-switched">is allowed</a>, though I prefer 1/N in the forward transform since it gives the <em>actual</em> sizes for the time spikes. You can get wild and even use $1/\sqrt{N}$ on both transforms (going forward and back creates the 1/N factor).</li>
<li>n/N is the percent of the time we've gone through. 2 * pi * k is our speed in radians / sec. e^-ix is our backwards-moving circular path. The combination is how far we've moved, for this speed and time.</li>
<li>The raw equations for the Fourier Transform just say "add the complex numbers". Many programming languages cannot handle complex numbers directly, so you convert everything to rectangular coordinates and add those.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Onward</h2>
<p>This was my most challenging article yet. The Fourier Transform has several flavors (discrete/continuous/finite/infinite), covers deep math (Dirac delta functions), and it's easy to get lost in details. I was constantly bumping into the edge of my knowledge.</p>
<p>But there's always simple analogies out there -- I refuse to think otherwise. Whether it's a smoothie or Usain Bolt &amp; Granny crossing the finish line, take a simple understanding and refine it. The analogy is flawed, and that's ok: it's a raft to use, and leave behind once we cross the river.</p>
<p>I realized how feeble my own understanding was when I couldn't work out the transform of <code>(1 0 0 0)</code> in my head. For me, it was like saying I knew addition but, gee whiz, I'm not sure what "1 + 1 + 1 + 1" would be. Why not? Shouldn't we have an intuition for the simplest of operations?</p>
<p>That discomfort led me around the web to build my intuition. In addition to the references in the article, I'd like to thank:</p>

<p>Imagine spinning your signal in a centrifuge and checking for a bias. I have a correction: we must spin <em>backwards</em> (the exponent in the equation above should be $e^{-i 2 \pi...}$). You already know why: we need a phase <em>delay</em> so spikes appear in the <em>future</em>.</p>

At this point a lot of this work is very technically narrow, dealing with CUDA, GPU issues, numerical stability, etc. On the other side are people who are using the models through the APIs in various ways. This is much more open-ended and potentially creative, but you don't need to know how QLearning works to do this.<p>It's a bit analogous to the situation with microprocessors. There is a ton of deep technical knowledge about how chips work, but most of this knowledge isn't critical for mainstream programming.

				<p>We are excited to announce that we have partnered with <a href="https://about.google/">Google</a> and <a href="https://theforge.dev/">The Forge</a> to bring some helpful performance optimizations to our Vulkan mobile backend. This will primarily benefit users targeting Vulkan-capable mobile devices.</p>

<p>Google is committed to enhancing the Android gaming ecosystem by ensuring that Vulkan is well supported across many games, game engines, and devices. Lucky for us, this means that they have decided to help us ensure that our Vulkan mobile renderer is as efficient as possible.</p>

<p>The Forge is one of the premier developers in the world specializing in building custom game engines and rendering solutions as well as optimizing existing game engines.</p>

<p>The Forge will spend the next several months working on Godot and bringing their expertise to our engine. They will be assisted by experts at Google and, of course, Godot contributors.</p>

<p>We are excited to welcome The Forge into the Godot pool of contributors and we are very thankful to Google for their assistance as well!</p>

<p>The end goal for all of us is to create an amazing ecosystem for games on Android. We are happy to already participate in that ecosystem and look forward to allowing game developers to push their ideas even further with Vulkan.</p>

MI300, a version of which will power the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan_(supercomputer)" target="_blank">El Capitan</a> supercomputer, is a layer cake of computing, memory, and communication that’s three slices of silicon high and that can sling as much as 17 terabytes of data vertically between those slices. The result is as much as a 3.4-fold boost in speed for certain machine-learning-critical calculations. The chip offers both contrasts and similarities to competing approaches such as Nvidia’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-supercomputing-cpu-puts-intel-under-pressure" target="_blank">Grace Hopper superchip</a> and Intel’s supercomputer accelerator <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/intel-s-exascale-supercomputer-chip-is-a-master-class-in-3d-integration" target="_self">Ponte Vecchio</a>.<br></p><p>MI300a stacks three CPU <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/chiplets" target="_blank">chiplets</a> (called compute complex dies, or CCDs, in AMD’s lingo) and six accelerator chiplets (XCDs) on top of four input-output dies (IODs), all on top of a piece of silicon that links them together to eight stacks of high-bandwidth DRAM that ring the superchip. (The MI300x substitutes the CCDs for two more XCDs, for an accelerator-only system.) With the scaling of transistors in the plane of the silicon slowing down, 3D stacking is seen as a key method to get more transistors into the same area and keep driving Moore’s Law forward.</p><p><img alt="Grey, labeled rectangles with orange and gold vertical lines connecting them." data-rm-shortcode-id="b87acda6384d54374dd4564223f0574f" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/grey-labeled-rectangles-with-orange-and-gold-vertical-lines-connecting-them.jpg?id=50661489&amp;width=980" height="240" id="a7fd1" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/grey-labeled-rectangles-with-orange-and-gold-vertical-lines-connecting-them.jpg?id=50661489&amp;width=980" width="1057"><small data-gramm="false" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-246886" placeholder="Add Photo Caption..." spellcheck="false">Compute and AI chiplets are stacked on top of I/O and cache chiplets in the MI300a.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">AMD</small></p><p>“It’s a truly amazing silicon stack up that delivers the highest density performance that industry knows how to produce at this time,” says <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chiplet" target="_self">Sam Naffziger</a>, a senior vice president and corporate fellow at AMD. The integration is done using two Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. technologies, <a href="https://3dfabric.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/technology/SoIC.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SoIC (system on integrated chips) and CoWoS (chip on wafer on substrate)</a>. The latter stacks smaller chips on top of larger ones using hybrid bonding, which links copper pads on each chip directly without solder. It is used to produce AMD’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/amd-3d-stacking-intel-graphcore" target="_self">V-Cache,</a> a cache-memory expanding chiplet that stacks on its highest-end CPU chiplets. The former, CoWos, stacks chiplets on a larger piece of silicon, called an interposer, which is built to contain high-density interconnects.</p><h2>Similarities and differences between AMD and Nvidia</h2><p>There are both similarities and differences to chief rival Nvidia’s approach. Just as Nvidia did in its Hopper architecture, AMD’s accelerator architecture, CDNA3, added the capability of computing with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/#:~:text=AI%2Dfused%20HPC%20applications%20can,operations%2C%20with%20zero%20code%20changes." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">truncated 32-bit numbers called TF32</a> and with two different forms of 8-bit floating-point numbers. The latter attribute is used to speed the training of certain parts of transformer neural networks, such as large language models. They also both include a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-gpu" target="_self">scheme that reduces the size of the neural network</a>, called 4:2 sparsity.</p><p>Another similarity is the inclusion of both CPU and GPU in the same <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/3d-packaging" target="_blank">package</a>. In many AI computer systems, GPUs and CPUs are separately packaged chips deployed in a 4 to 1 ratio. One advantage to joining them together in a single superchip is that both CPU and GPU have high-bandwidth access to the same cache and high-bandwidth DRAM (HBM) in a way that won’t trip each other up as they read and write data.</p><p>Nvidia’s <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-grace-hopper-superchip-architecture-in-depth/" target="_blank">Grace Hopper</a> is such a superchip combination linking the Grace CPU to the Hopper GPU through Nvidia’s Nvidia NVLink Chip-2-Chip interconnects. AMD’s MI300a is as well, by integrating three CPU dies designed for its Genoa line and six XCD accelerators using its AMD Infinity Fabric interconnect technology.</p><p>But a casual glance at Grace Hopper and MI300 show some profound differences. Grace and Hopper are each individual dies that integrate all of a system-on-chip’s needed functional blocks—compute, I/O, and cache. They are linked horizontally, and they are large—nearly at the size limit of photolithography technology.</p><p>AMD took a different approach, one that it has followed for several generations of its CPUs and that rival <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> used for its 3D-stacked supercomputer accelerator Ponte Vecchio. The concept is called system-technology-co-optimization, or STCO. That means designers started by breaking the chip down into its functions and decided which functions needed which manufacturing technology.</p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img alt="" data-rm-shortcode-id="824acf053d8de4f6c76ec91569d65c78" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-slice-of-mi300-stack-from-the-carrier-silicon-at-the-top-to-the-solder-ball-at-the-bottom-of-the-package.jpg?id=50682953&amp;width=980" height="3661" id="cde2e" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-slice-of-mi300-stack-from-the-carrier-silicon-at-the-top-to-the-solder-ball-at-the-bottom-of-the-package.jpg?id=50682953&amp;width=980" width="1126"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">A slice of MI300 stack from the carrier silicon at the top to the solder ball at the bottom of the package.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">AMD</small></p><p>“What we wanted to do with MI300 was to scale beyond what was possible in a single monolithic GPU. So we deconstructed it into pieces and then built it back up,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-smith-amd/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alan Smith</a>, a senior fellow and the chief architect for Instinct. Although it’s been doing so for several generations of CPUs, the MI300 is the first time the company has made GPU chiplets and bound them in a single system.</p><p>“Breaking the GPU into chiplets allowed us to put the compute in the most advanced process node while keeping the rest of the chip in technology that’s more appropriate for cache and I/O,” he says. In the case of the MI300, all the compute was built using TSMC’s N5 process, the most advanced available and the one used for Nvidia’s top-line GPUs. Neither the I/O functions nor the system’s cache memory benefit from N5, so AMD chose a less-expensive technology (N6) for those. Therefore, those two functions could then be built together on the same chiplet.</p><p>With the functions broken up, all the pieces of silicon involved in the MI300 are small. The largest, the I/O dies, are not even half the size of Hopper. And the CCDs are only about one-fifth the size of the I/O die. The small sizes make a big difference. Generally, smaller chips yield better. That is, a single wafer will provide a higher proportion of working small chips than it would large chips. “3D integration isn’t free,” says Naffziger. But the higher yield offsets the cost, he says.</p><h2>Luck and experience</h2><p>The design involved some clever reuse of existing technologies and designs, a few compromises, and a little luck, according to Naffziger, an IEEE Fellow. The reuse came in two instances. First, AMD was able to do the 3D integration with a degree of confidence because it had already been using the exact same pitch of vertical interconnects—9 micrometers—in its V-cache product.</p><p>As an optional add-on that AMD was able to charge extra for, V-cache offers little risk that poor yield or other problems will have a big impact on the company. “It’s been a great thing to enable us to wring out the manufacturing problems and all the design complexities of 3D stacking without endangering the main product line,” says Naffziger.</p><p>The other instance of reuse was a bit chancier. When the MI300 team decided that a CPU/GPU combination was needed, Naffziger “somewhat sheepishly” asked the head of the team designing the Zen4 CCD for the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/events/epyc4" target="_blank">Genoa CPU</a> if the CCD could be made to fit the MI300’s needs. That team was under pressure to meet an earlier deadline than expected, but a day later they responded. Naffziger was in luck; the Zen4 CCD had a small blank space in just the right spot to make the vertical connections to the MI300 I/O die and their associated circuitry without a disruption to the overall design.</p><p>Nevertheless, there was still some geometry that needed solving. To make all the internal communications work, the four I/O chiplets had to be facing each other on a particular edge. That meant making a mirror-image version of the chiplet. Because it was codesigned with the I/O chiplet, the XCD and its vertical connections were built to link up with both versions of the I/O. But there was no messing with the CCD, which they were lucky to have at all. So instead the I/O was designed with redundant connections, so that no matter which version of the chiplet it sat on, the CCD would connect.</p><p><img alt="Multicolor rectangle with capital lettering in places." data-rm-shortcode-id="fd7dd6159bc9fba3eaf956a11c231d6e" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/multicolor-rectangle-with-capital-lettering-in-places.jpg?id=50662187&amp;width=980" height="412" id="917d3" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/multicolor-rectangle-with-capital-lettering-in-places.jpg?id=50662187&amp;width=980" width="896"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">To get everything to line up, the IOD chiplets had to be made as mirrors of each other, and the accelerator (XCD) and compute (CCD) chiplets had to be rotated.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">AMD</small></p><p>The power grid, which has to deliver hundreds of amperes of current to the compute dies at the top of the stack, faced similar challenges because it too had to accommodate all the various chiplet orientations, Naffziger noted.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="hcfe-content" role="main">            <article class="page" sc-render-smart-button="false" itemscope=""> <div data-stats-ve="35"><p>If you work with Usenet groups in Google Groups, support for these groups is ending soon.</p>

<h2>What’s changing?</h2>

<p>Starting on February 22, 2024, you can no longer use Google Groups (at groups.google.com) to post content to Usenet groups, subscribe to Usenet groups, or view new Usenet content. You can continue to view and search for historical Usenet content posted before February 22, 2024 on Google Groups.</p>

<p>In addition, Google’s Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) server and associated peering will no longer be available, meaning Google will not support serving new Usenet content or exchanging content with other NNTP servers.</p>

<p>This change will not impact any non-Usenet content on Google Groups, including all user and organization-created groups. Most of the current Google Groups content&nbsp; is not Usenet content and will not be affected.</p>

<h2>What do I need to do?</h2>

<p>If you don’t actively engage with Usenet content, you don’t need to do anything. Current Usenet users will need to do two things before February 22, 2024 if they want to continue engaging with Usenet content:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Find a new Usenet client. </strong>Several free and paid alternatives are available, both web-based and application-based. To find a client, do a web search for "how do I find a usenet text client"</li>
  <li><strong>Find a new public Usenet server. </strong>The new client you choose will likely have a default server or a set of curated options for you. If not, to find a server, do a web search for "public NNTP servers."</li>
</ol>

<p>Because Usenet is a distributed system, <strong>you do not need to migrate data</strong>. All of the Usenet content you can access today on Google Groups should already be synced to the new server you choose. After you select a new client and server, you can reselect the groups you’re interested in.</p>

<h2>Why is Google Groups support for Usenet ending?</h2>

<p>Over the last several years, legitimate activity in text-based Usenet groups has declined significantly because users have moved to more modern technologies and formats such as social media and web-based forums. Much of the content being disseminated via Usenet today is binary (non-text) file sharing, which Google Groups does not support, as well as spam.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ch3SNe">The Stanford Prison Experiment, one of the most famous and compelling psychological studies of all time, told us a tantalizingly simple story about human nature. </p>
<p id="2DE2Gk">The study took paid participants and assigned them to be “inmates” or “guards” in a mock prison at Stanford University. Soon after the experiment began, the “guards” began mistreating the “prisoners,” implying evil is brought out by circumstance. The authors, in their conclusions, suggested innocent people, thrown into a situation where they have power over others, will begin to abuse that power. And people who are put into a situation where they are powerless will be driven to submission, even madness. </p>
<p id="buIC1G">The Stanford Prison Experiment has been <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278144932_Coverage_of_the_Stanford_Prison_Experiment_in_Introductory_Social_Psychology_Textbooks">included</a> in many, many introductory psychology textbooks and <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1475725714568007">is often cited uncritically</a>. It’s the subject of movies, documentaries, books, television shows, and <a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/spe/catalog/gf026hb5740">congressional testimony</a>.</p>
<p id="m7VLu5">But its findings were wrong. Very wrong. And not just due to its questionable ethics <a href="https://twitter.com/david_m_amodio/status/1006958007983460361">or lack of concrete data</a> — but because of deceit. </p>
<p id="cmyBh2">A new <a href="https://medium.com/s/trustissues/the-lifespan-of-a-lie-d869212b1f62">exposé</a> published by Medium based on previously unpublished <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/6/14/17464516/stanford-prison-experiment-audio">recordings</a> of Philip Zimbardo, the Stanford psychologist who ran the study, and interviews with his participants, <a href="https://medium.com/s/trustissues/the-lifespan-of-a-lie-d869212b1f62">offers</a> convincing evidence that the guards in the experiment were coached to be cruel. It also shows that the experiment’s most memorable moment — of a prisoner descending into a screaming fit, proclaiming, “I’m burning up inside!” — was the result of the prisoner acting. “I took it as a kind of an improv exercise,” one of the guards told reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/benzblum?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Ben Blum</a>. “I believed that I was doing what the researchers wanted me to do.” </p>
<p id="sk2QDd">The findings have long been subject to scrutiny — many think of them <a href="https://twitter.com/david_m_amodio/status/1006958007983460361">as more of a dramatic demonstration</a>, a sort-of academic reality show, than a serious bit of science. But these new revelations incited an immediate response. “We must stop celebrating this work,” personality psychologist Simine Vazire <a href="https://twitter.com/siminevazire/status/1006070517772607488">tweeted</a>, in response to the <a href="https://medium.com/s/trustissues/the-lifespan-of-a-lie-d869212b1f62">article</a>. “It’s anti-scientific. Get it out of textbooks.” Many other psychologists have expressed similar sentiments. </p>
<p id="8V75RZ">(<strong>Update</strong>: Since this article published, the journal <em>American Psychologist</em> has<a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/2019-letexier.pdf"> published a thorough debunking</a> of the Stanford Prison Experiment that goes beyond what Blum found in his piece. There’s even more evidence that the “guards” knew the results that Zimbardo wanted to produce, and were trained to meet his goals. It also provides evidence that the conclusions of the experiment were predetermined.) </p>
<p id="c8SIec">Many of the classic show-stopping experiments in psychology have lately turned out to be wrong, fraudulent, or outdated. And in recent years, social scientists have begun to reckon with the truth that their old work needs a redo, the “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/3/14/11219446/psychology-replication-crisis">replication crisis</a>.” But there’s been a lag — in the popular consciousness and in how psychology is taught by teachers and textbooks. It’s time to catch up. </p>

<p id="4jOET1">The Zimbardo prison experiment is not the only classic study that has been recently scrutinized, reevaluated, or outright exposed as a fraud. Recently, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/16/a-real-life-lord-of-the-flies-the-troubling-legacy-of-the-robbers-cave-experiment">science journalist Gina Perry</a> found that the infamous “Robbers Cave“ experiment in the 1950s — in which young boys at summer camp were essentially manipulated into joining warring factions — was a do-over from a failed previous version of an experiment, which the scientists never mentioned in an academic paper. That’s a glaring omission. It’s wrong to throw out data that refutes your hypothesis and only publicize data that supports it. </p>
<p id="tXLsi4">Perry has also revealed inconsistencies in another major early work in psychology: the Milgram electroshock test, in which participants were told by an authority figure to deliver seemingly lethal doses of electricity to an unseen hapless soul. Her investigations show some <a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/electric-schlock-65377">evidence of</a> researchers going off the study script and possibly coercing participants to deliver the desired results. (Somewhat ironically, the new revelations about the prison experiment also show the power an authority figure — in this case Zimbardo himself and his “warden” — has in manipulating others to be cruel.)</p>
<p id="13AnP0">Other studies have been reevaluated for more honest, methodological snafus. Recently, I wrote about the “marshmallow test,” a series of studies from the early ’90s that suggested the ability to delay gratification at a young age <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/6/6/17413000/marshmallow-test-replication-mischel-psychology">is correlated with success later in life</a>. New research finds that if the original marshmallow test authors had a larger sample size, and greater research controls, their results would not have been the showstoppers they were in the ’90s. I can list so many more textbook psychology findings that have either not replicated, or are currently in the midst of a serious reevaluation. </p>
<p id="2sg5OI">Like: </p>
<ul>
<li id="OMhdEa">Social priming: People who read “old”-sounding words (like “nursing home”) were more likely to walk slowly — showing how our brains can be subtly “primed” with thoughts and actions.</li>
<li id="yPoABY">The facial feedback hypothesis: Merely activating muscles around the mouth caused people to become happier — demonstrating how our bodies tell our brains what emotions to feel.</li>
<li id="Bqa2bI">Stereotype threat: Minorities and maligned social groups don’t perform as well on tests due to anxieties about becoming a stereotype themselves. </li>
<li id="i75kyS">Ego depletion: The idea that willpower is a finite mental resource.</li>
</ul>
<p id="KsruDx">Alas, the past few years<a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/3/14/11219446/psychology-replication-crisis"> have brought about a reckoning</a> for these ideas and social psychology as a whole. </p>
<p id="L7bU4Q">Many psychological theories have been debunked or diminished in rigorous replication attempts. Psychologists are now realizing it's <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/31/16021654/p-values-statistical-significance-redefine-0005">more likely</a> that false positives will make it through to publication than inconclusive results. And they’ve realized that experimental methods commonly used just a few years ago aren’t rigorous enough. For instance, it used to be commonplace for scientists to publish experiments that sampled about 50 undergraduate students. Today, scientists realize this <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/31/16021654/p-values-statistical-significance-redefine-0005">is a recipe for false positives</a>, and strive for sample sizes in the hundreds and ideally from a more representative subject pool.  </p>
<p id="tKajYd">Nevertheless, in so many of these cases, scientists have moved on and corrected errors, and are still doing well-intentioned work to understand the heart of humanity. For instance, work on one of psychology’s oldest fixations — dehumanization, the ability to see another as less than human — continues with methodological rigor, <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/3/7/14456154/dehumanization-psychology-explained">helping us understand</a> the modern-day maltreatment of Muslims and immigrants in America.  </p>
<p id="06Yvsy">In some cases, time has shown that flawed original experiments offer worthwhile reexamination. The original Milgram experiment was flawed. But at least its study design — which brings in participants to administer shocks (not actually carried out) to punish others for failing at a memory test — is basically repeatable today with some ethical tweaks.</p>
<p id="TYA1u7"><a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550617693060">And</a> it seems like Milgram’s conclusions may hold up: In a recent study, many people found demands from <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550617693060">an authority figure to be a compelling</a> reason to shock another. However, it’s possible, due to something known as the file-drawer effect, that failed replications of the Milgram experiment have not been published. Replication attempts at the Stanford prison study, on the other hand, <a href="http://www.bbcprisonstudy.org/pdfs/bjsp(2006)tyrannny.pdf">have been a mess</a>.</p>
<p id="dTlTu4">In science, too often, the first demonstration of an idea becomes the lasting one — in both pop culture and academia. But this isn’t how science is supposed to work at all! </p>
<p id="dC0VT9">Science is a frustrating, iterative process. When we communicate it, we need to get beyond the idea that a single, stunning study ought to last the test of time. Scientists know this as well, but their institutions have often discouraged them from replicating old work, instead of the pursuit of new and exciting, attention-grabbing studies. (Journalists are <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12016710/science-challeges-research-funding-peer-review-process">part of the problem too</a>, imbuing small, insignificant studies with more importance and meaning than they’re due.)  </p>
<p id="PylPjK">Thankfully, there are researchers thinking very hard, and very earnestly, on trying to make psychology a more replicable, robust science. There’s even a whole <a href="https://osf.io/jtcu9/">Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science</a> devoted to these issues.</p>
<p id="8z2Cpw">Follow-up results <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/3/14/11219446/psychology-replication-crisis">tend to be less dramatic than original findings</a>, but they are more useful in helping discover the truth. And it’s not that the Stanford Prison Experiment has no place in a classroom. It’s interesting as history. Psychologists like Zimbardo and Milgram were highly influenced by World War II. Their experiments were, in part, an attempt to figure out why ordinary people would fall for Nazism. That’s an important question, one that set the agenda for a huge amount of research in psychological science, and is still echoed in papers today. </p>
<h3 id="ZLgDN1">Textbooks need to catch up </h3>
<p id="3yADvM">Psychology has changed tremendously over the past few years. Many studies used to teach the next generation of psychologists have been intensely scrutinized, and found to be in error. But troublingly, <a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/01/theres-a-problem-with-a-bunch-of-psychology-textbooks.html">the textbooks have not been updated accordingly</a>.</p>
<p id="WVNuea">That’s the conclusion of a <a href="http://christopherjferguson.com/Education%20or%20Indoctrination.pdf">2016 study</a> in <em>Current Psychology. “</em>By and large,” the study explains (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p id="PhzjQV">introductory textbooks have difficulty accurately portraying controversial topics with care or, in some cases, simply avoid covering them at all. ... <strong>readers of introductory textbooks may be unintentionally misinformed on these topics.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p id="f0osHA">The study authors — from Texas A&amp;M and Stetson universities — gathered a stack of 24 popular introductory psych textbooks and began looking for coverage of 12 contested ideas or myths in psychology.</p>
<p id="DtAEZl">The ideas — like stereotype threat, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1281386/">Mozart effect</a>, and whether there’s a “narcissism epidemic” among millennials — have not necessarily been disproven. Nevertheless, there are credible and noteworthy studies that cast doubt on them. The list of ideas also included some urban legends — like the one about the brain only using 10 percent of its potential at any given time, and a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/her-shocking-murder-became-the-stuff-of-legend-but-everyone-got-the-story-wrong/2016/06/29/544916d8-3952-11e6-9ccd-d6005beac8b3_story.html?utm_term=.e061b368fd71">debunked</a> story about how bystanders refused to help a woman named Kitty Genovese while she was being murdered.</p>
<p id="bXTNSJ">The researchers then rated the texts on how they handled these contested ideas. The results found a troubling amount of “biased” coverage on many of the topic areas.</p>

<p id="IGYwOa">But why wouldn’t these textbooks include more doubt? Replication, after all, is a cornerstone of any science. </p>
<p id="chk6i9">One idea is that textbooks, in the pursuit of covering a wide range of topics, aren’t meant to be authoritative on these individual controversies. But something else might be going on. The study authors suggest these textbook authors are trying to “oversell” psychology as a discipline, to get more undergraduates to study it full time. (I have to admit that it might have worked on me back when I was an undeclared undergraduate.) </p>
<p id="mAobmd">There are some caveats to mention with the study: One is that the 12 topics the authors chose to scrutinize are completely arbitrary. “And many other potential issues were left out of our analysis,” they note. Also, the textbooks included were printed in the spring of 2012; it’s possible they have been updated since then. </p>
<p id="gWz0Tl">Recently, I asked <a href="https://twitter.com/B_resnick/status/1006197663908487168">on Twitter</a> how intro psychology professors deal with inconsistencies in their textbooks. Their answers were simple. Some say they decided to get rid of textbooks (which save students money) and focus on teaching individual articles. Others have another solution that’s just as simple: “You point out the wrong, outdated, and less-than-replicable sections,” <a href="https://twitter.com/lakens">Daniël Lakens</a>, a professor at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, said. He offered a useful example of one of the slides he uses in class.</p>

<p id="TOyfMv">Anecdotally, Illinois State University professor Joe Hilgard said he thinks his students appreciate “the ‘cutting-edge’ feeling from knowing something that the textbook didn’t.” (Also, who really, earnestly reads the textbook in an introductory college course?) </p>

<p id="3QgI6I">And it seems this type of teaching is catching on. A (not perfectly representative) <a href="https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/va7jg/?action=download%26mode=render">recent survey of</a> 262 psychology professors found more than half said replication issues <a href="https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/va7jg/?action=download%26mode=render">impacted their teaching</a>. On the other hand, 40 percent said they hadn’t. So whether students are exposed to the recent reckoning is all up to the teachers they have.  </p>
<p id="lpA4to">If it’s true that textbooks and teachers are still neglecting to cover replication issues, then I’d argue they are actually underselling the science. To teach the “replication crisis” is to teach students that science strives to be self-correcting. It would instill in them the value that science ought to be reproducible.</p>
<p id="xCWDnp">Understanding human behavior is a hard problem. Finding out the answers shouldn’t be easy. If anything, that should give students more motivation to become the generation of scientists who get it right.</p>
<p id="osnF3b">“Textbooks may be missing an opportunity for myth busting,” the <em>Current Psychology</em> study’s authors write. That’s, ideally, what young scientist ought to learn: how to bust myths and find the truth. </p>

    <p>
      Readers rely on Vox for clear, nuanced coverage that not only illuminates the issues, but poses solutions, too. And we rely on help from our readers: Advertising and grants cover the majority of our costs, but we count on contributions to help us close the gaps in our budget. In fact, we’re looking to reach 95,000 individual contributions before the end of the year. <a href="http://vox.com/pages/support-now?itm_campaign=eoy-2023&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=footer%0D%0A">Will you make the next contribution right now?</a> Our average gift is just $20 — and it goes a long way in helping us keep our work free. Vox is here to help everyone understand what’s shaping the world — not just the people who can afford to pay for a subscription. We believe that’s an important part of building a more equal society. <a href="http://vox.com/pages/support-now?itm_campaign=eoy-2023&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=footer%0D%0A">Join that mission by making a contribution today.</a>
