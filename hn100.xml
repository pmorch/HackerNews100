                 <div><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span> Apple today introduced <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/" target="_blank">Apple Intelligence</a>, the personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that’s incredibly useful and relevant. Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. It harnesses the power of Apple silicon to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. With Private Cloud Compute, Apple sets a new standard for privacy in AI, with the ability to flex and scale computational capacity between on-device processing and larger, server-based models that run on dedicated Apple silicon servers.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“We’re thrilled to introduce a new chapter in Apple innovation. Apple Intelligence will transform what users can do with our products — and what our products can do for our users,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Our unique approach combines generative AI with a user’s personal context to deliver truly helpful intelligence. And it can access that information in a completely private and secure way to help users do the things that matter most to them. This is AI as only Apple can deliver it, and we can’t wait for users to experience what it can do.”

                 <div>Apple Intelligence unlocks new ways for users to enhance their writing and communicate more effectively. With brand-new systemwide Writing Tools built into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Whether tidying up class notes, ensuring a blog post reads just right, or making sure an email is perfectly crafted, Writing Tools help users feel more confident in their writing. With Rewrite, Apple Intelligence allows users to choose from different versions of what they have written, adjusting the tone to suit the audience and task at hand. From finessing a cover letter, to adding humor and creativity to a party invitation, Rewrite helps deliver the right words to meet the occasion. Proofread checks grammar, word choice, and sentence structure while also suggesting edits — along with explanations of the edits — that users can review or quickly accept. With Summarize, users can select text and have it recapped in the form of a digestible paragraph, bulleted key points, a table, or a list.

        <div>In Mail, staying on top of emails has never been easier. With Priority Messages, a new section at the top of the inbox shows the most urgent emails, like a same-day dinner invitation or boarding pass. Across a user’s inbox, instead of previewing the first few lines of each email, they can see summaries without needing to open a message. For long threads, users can view pertinent details with just a tap. Smart Reply provides suggestions for a quick response, and will identify questions in an email to ensure everything is answered.

        <div>Deep understanding of language also extends to Notifications. Priority Notifications appear at the top of the stack to surface what’s most important, and summaries help users scan long or stacked notifications to show key details right on the Lock Screen, such as when a group chat is particularly active. And to help users stay present in what they’re doing, Reduce Interruptions is a new Focus that surfaces only the notifications that might need immediate attention, like a text about an early pickup from daycare.

                 <div>Searching for photos and videos becomes even more convenient with Apple Intelligence. Natural language can be used to search for specific photos, such as “Maya skateboarding in a tie-dye shirt,” or “Katie with stickers on her face.” Search in videos also becomes more powerful with the ability to find specific moments in clips so users can go right to the relevant segment. Additionally, the new Clean Up tool can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo — without accidentally altering the subject.

Users will even get song suggestions to match their memory from Apple Music. As with all Apple Intelligence features, user photos and videos are kept private on device and are not shared with Apple or anyone else.

                 <div>Powered by Apple Intelligence, Siri becomes more deeply integrated into the system experience. With richer language-understanding capabilities, Siri is more natural, more contextually relevant, and more personal, with the ability to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. It can follow along if users stumble over words and maintain context from one request to the next. Additionally, users can type to Siri, and switch between text and voice to communicate with Siri in whatever way feels right for the moment. Siri also has a brand-new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when Siri is active.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>To be truly helpful, Apple Intelligence relies on understanding deep personal context while also protecting user privacy. A cornerstone of Apple Intelligence is on-device processing, and many of the models that power it run entirely on device. To run more complex requests that require more processing power, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of Apple devices into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>With Private Cloud Compute, Apple Intelligence can flex and scale its computational capacity and draw on larger, server-based models for more complex requests. These models run on servers powered by Apple silicon, providing a foundation that allows Apple to ensure that data is never retained or exposed.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Independent experts can inspect the code that runs on Apple silicon servers to verify privacy, and Private Cloud Compute cryptographically ensures that iPhone, iPad, and Mac do not talk to a server unless its software has been publicly logged for inspection. Apple Intelligence with Private Cloud Compute sets a new standard for privacy in AI, unlocking intelligence users can trust.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Apple is integrating ChatGPT access into experiences within iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, allowing users to access its expertise — as well as its image- and document-understanding capabilities — without needing to jump between tools.

                 <div>Siri can tap into ChatGPT’s expertise when helpful. Users are asked before any questions are sent to ChatGPT, along with any documents or photos, and Siri then presents the answer directly.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-is-launching-its-own-password-manager-app/">https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-is-launching-its-own-password-manager-app/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40636502">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">While you can already use your iCloud account to store and sync passwords across your devices, it wasn’t easy to figure out. Passwords were available from the Settings app on your Mac or iPhone.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/everything-apple-announced-wwdc-2024/">At WWDC 2024 on Monday</a>, Apple introduced the Passwords app. It will be available with the next major releases of iOS, macOS and visionOS — that is, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-unveils-ios-18-with-more-customization-options/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-unveils-macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-debuts-visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to all the features you can find in the Passwords menu today, there’s a new column on the left that lets you more easily navigate your password collection. For instance, you can view all your passwords or just Wi-Fi passwords (a new addition), passkeys or codes that aren’t related to a website or service.</p>

<p>As a reminder, iCloud Passwords already support shared passwords, verification codes and a note field for every password entry. This new app will make it easier to get started and think about using iCloud Passwords to store your sensitive information.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Apple on Monday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/everything-apple-announced-wwdc-2024/">at WWDC 2024</a> unveiled Apple Intelligence, its long awaited, ecosystem-wide push into generative AI. As earlier rumors suggested, the new feature is called Apple Intelligence (A.I., get it?). The company promised the feature will be built with safety at its core, along with highly personalized experiences.</p>

<p>“Most importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications, and more,” CEO Tim Cook noted. “And of course, it has to be built with privacy from the ground up together. All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence. It’s personal intelligence, and it’s the next big step for Apple.”</p>

	
	


<p>The company has been pushing the feature as integral to all of its various operating system offerings, including iOS, macOS and the latest, VisionOS. </p>

<p>“It has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,” Cook said. “It has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences. Most importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications and more and of course, it has to be built with privacy from the ground up. Together. All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence. it’s personal intelligence. and it’s the next big step for Apple.”</p>

<p>SVP Craig Federighi added, “Apple intelligence is grounded in your personal data and context.” The feature will effectively build upon all of the personal data that users input into applications like Calendar and Maps. </p>

<p>The system is built on large language and intelligence models. Much of that processing is done locally according to the company, utilizes the latest version Apple silicon. “Many of these models run entirely on device,” Federighi claimed during the event. </p>

<p>That said, these consumer systems still have limitations. As such, some of the heavy lifting needs to be done off device in the cloud. Apple is adding Private Cloud Compute” to the offering. The back end uses services that run Apple chips, in a bid to increase privacy for this highly personal data.</p>

	
	



<p>Apple Intelligence also includes what is likely the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-gives-siri-a-makeover/">biggest update to Siri</a> since it was announced more than a decade ago. the company says the feature is “more deeply integrated” into its operating systems. In the case of iOS, that means trading the familiar Siri icon for a blue glowing border that surrounds the desktop while in use.</p>

	
	


<p>Siri is no longer just a voice interface. Apple is also adding the ability to type queries directly into the system to access its generative AI-based intelligence. It’s an acknowledgment that voice is often not the best interface for these systems. </p>

<p>App Intents, meanwhile, brings the ability to integrate the assistant more directly into different apps. That will start with first-party applications, but the company will also be opening up access to third parties. That addition will dramatically improve the kinds of things that Siri can do directly.</p>

<p>The offering will also open up multitasking in a profound way, allowing a kind of cross-app compatibility. That means, for instance, that users won’t have to keep switching between Calendar, Mail and Maps in order to schedule meetings, for example.</p>

<p>Apple Intelligence will be integrated into most of the company’s apps. That includes things like the ability to help compose messages inside Mail (along with third party apps) or just utilize Smart Replies to respond. This is, notably, a feature Google has offered for some time now in Gmail, and has continued to build out using its own generative AI model, Gemini.</p>

<p>The company is even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-debuts-ai-generated-bitmoji/">bringing the feature to emojis with Genmoji</a> (yep, that’s the name). The feature uses a text field to build customized emojis. Image Playground, meanwhile, is an on-device image generator that is built into apps like Messages, Keynote, Pages and Freeform. Apple is also bringing a standalone Image Playground app to iOS and opening up access to the offering via an API.</p>

<p>Image Wand, meanwhile, is a new tool for Apple Pencil that lets users circle text to create an image. Effectively it’s Apple’s take on Google’s Circle to Search, only focused on images. </p>

	
	


<p>Search has been built, as well, for content like photos and videos. The company promising more natural language searches inside of these applications. The gen AI models also make it easier to build slideshows inside of Photos, again, using natural language prompts. Apple Intelligence will be rolling out to the latest versions of its operating systems, including iOS and iPadOS 18, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-unveils-macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/visionos-can-now-make-spatial-photos-out-of-3d-images/">visionOS 2</a>. It’s available for free with those updates.</p>

<p>The feature will be coming to iPhone 15 Pro and M1 Mac and iPad devices. The standard iPhone 15 will not be getting the feature, likely owing to limitations of the chip.</p>

<p>As expected, Apple also announced a partnership with OpenAI that brings ChatGPT to offerings like Siri. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-brings-chatgpt-to-its-apps-including-siri/">The GPT 4.0-powered feature</a> utilizes that company’s image and text generation. The offering will give users access without having to sign up for an account or pay a fee (though, they can still upgrade to premium).</p>

<p>That’s arriving for iOS, iPadOS and macOS later this year. The company says it also be bringing integration to other third-party LLMs, though didn’t offer much detail. It seems likely that Google’s Gemini is near the top of that list.</p>

<p>App Review has <a href="https://x.com/UTMapp/status/1799647652134654045">rejected a submission</a> from the developers of <a href="https://getutm.app/">UTM</a>, a generic PC system emulator for iPhone and iPad. </p>



<p>The open source app was submitted to the store, given the recent rule change that allows retro game console emulators, like Delta or Folium. App Review rejected UTM, deciding that a “PC is not a console”. What is more surprising, is the fact that UTM says that Apple is also blocking the app from being listed in third-party app stores in the EU.</p>



<p>As written in the App Review Guidelines, Rule 4.7 covers “mini apps, mini games, streaming games, chatbots, plug-ins and game emulators”. </p>



<p>UTM says Apple refused to notarize the app because of the violation of rule 4.7, as that is included in Notarization Review Guidelines. However, the App Review Guidelines page disagrees. It does not annotate rule 4.7 as being part of the Notarization Review Guidelines. Indeed, if you select the “Show Notarization Review Guidelines Only” toggle, rule 4.7 is greyed out as not being applicable.</p>



<p>It’s therefore unclear if the Apple reviewers for UTM were incorrect in asserting the application was not suitable for distribution by third-party app stores in the EU. </p>



<p>However, as it stands, UTM is not proceeding to contest the ruling. As apps distributed on iOS cannot use a JIT compiler (other than specially entitled alternative browser engines), the functionality and performance of the emulators running through UTM SE, the version submitted for review that had JIT disabled, was significantly impaired. UTM says getting UTM SE approved “isn’t worth fighting for”.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>UTM for iOS will continue to be available using older ‘grey market’ sideloading methods for open source software, such as compiling and installing the app manually via Xcode. UTM for Mac is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/utm-virtual-machines/id1538878817">available in the Mac App Store</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-framer-name="Content" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p><em>This is a very long post for people who want a lot of details. If you want the shorter story of how I plan to avoid these mistakes at Otherbranch, look </em><a href="https://www.otherbranch.com/blog/rebooting-something-like-triplebyte"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>Discussion on Hacker News </em><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40634774" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3>It's a long story</h3><p>It's been a year and a half now since I was at the helm of a dying company.</p><p>I've had a lot of time to think.</p><p>My name is Rachel. I joined Triplebyte in 2018 as a random ops employee; after a few other roles I eventually became Triplebyte's head of product for its last two years. I'm also the founder here at Otherbranch.</p><p>I'm writing this retrospective for three reasons.</p><p>First, <a href="https://www.otherbranch.com/blog/rebooting-something-like-triplebyte"><strong>I’m trying to bring something like it back</strong></a> (if the website didn’t tip you off). And to try again, <em>I personally</em> need to understand why Triplebyte failed. I want to avoid those failure modes, and that means I need to know what they were and how to avoid them. Writing about them is a way to demand enough clarity and rigor from myself to publish something for the world.</p><p>Second, Triplebyte was, at one time, a company with an excellent brand delivering a well-liked product. Many people have asked me, both professionally and personally, why a product that had such a good reputation with engineers would abandon the product they loved - or how such an apparently-healthy product would fail. I'd like to answer that question as well as I can.</p><p>And third, I'd like to offer a peek into the realities and difficulties of business for readers who may never have faced such challenges themselves. I don’t mean to offer an excuse for our (or my) failures, nor for the many failures - both moral and tactical - made by businesses in general. But if you want to do business better, you need to <em>understand</em> business better, or at least as well as those who do it today. You have to know why those failures exist before you can avoid them. And I'd like to put some of that knowledge out into the public consciousness.</p><h3><strong>What was Triplebyte?</strong></h3><p><em>(I suggest reading this section even if you’re familiar with Triplebyte, since a lot of things changed over time.)</em></p><p>Triplebyte was a technical recruiting company for software engineers.</p><p>It came with an impressive founding pedigree. The founders were Harj Taggar, the first non-founding partner at<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator" rel="noopener"> Y Combinator</a>, and Ammon Bartram and Guillaume Luccisano, both engineers themselves. Ammon and Guillaume had previously co-founded and sold social-video company<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialcam" rel="noopener"> SocialCam</a> with<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Kan" rel="noopener"> Justin Kan</a>, himself best known for founding gaming site<a href="http://twitch.tv/" rel="noopener"> Twitch.tv</a> (its original name, justin.tv, is derived from his name). Triplebyte was funded by Y Combinator (and by their extended investment arm, YC Continuity) throughout its history, along with other major Silicon Valley investors.</p><p>Triplebyte sat at the intersection of two things that are central to tech culture: a(n at least nominally) meritocratic culture of testing and statistical rigor, and the problem of hiring good software engineers. It grew up alongside the rise of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_bootcamp" rel="noopener"> coding bootcamps</a>, growing skepticism about higher education (I think we might have done a podcast with<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Case_Against_Education" rel="noopener"> Bryan Caplan</a> once? it would certainly be on brand), and a huge boom in Silicon Valley investment driven by low interest rates and the wild success of Uber, Airbnb, and others.</p><p>The idea was this: if higher-education and prestigious experience weren't reliable sources of quality, and if you could make an ML model that could identify it better through testing, you could find great engineers who'd be missed by the usual resume screens. Then, because top engineering talent is <em>enormously</em> competitive, companies would be willing to pay for this newly-unearthed talent in a way that would result in a viable business.</p><p><em>(You may notice the double-vision here between "this is a good business opportunity" and "this is a meritocratic moral good". This pairing would become a defining feature of Triplebyte's culture. Like most organizations, the former often won out, but unlike many organizations the latter was not merely an excuse for the former. We really did struggle with that a lot.)</em></p><p>Over the eight years it existed, Triplebyte operated four main products. Some of their names changed over time, but I’ll call them by these names:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>FastTrack</strong>. Engineering candidates would take a quiz, followed by an interview with Triplebyte's engineers. If they passed both, we would introduce them to companies on the promise that those companies would skip them to onsite interviews. FastTrack emphasized speed, an elite cohort of engineers, and white-glove service. This was our main product from the founding of Triplebyte through 2019, then faded into a secondary role in 2020 before ultimately being shut down in 2021. (This is the product we're most heavily drawing on here at Otherbranch.)</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Source</strong>. Source was described internally as “LinkedIn for engineers”. The idea was to take the candidate pool we’d built up through years of the FastTrack product and create a network of skills-verified engineers that we could sell access to as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SaaS</a> product. Source emphasized volume and scalability. This was our main product in 2020-2021.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Screen</strong>. Screen began as a growth experiment. The idea was that we’d give companies access to our quizzes for free, as long as we could ask candidates to sign up for a Triplebyte account afterward. This proved very popular with companies. Screen was never monetized meaningfully (although we did occasionally charge for it to get companies to use it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blatant violation</a> of all economic sense). instead, it was meant to bring in candidates to create a valuable candidate database. It became our primary growth avenue in early 2021 and remained so for the remainder of Triplebyte’s history.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Magnet</strong>. Magnet was an automated sourcing tool built on Source’s infrastructure. We would set up campaigns on behalf of companies hiring through us, and Magnet would message candidates automatically (transparently; they knew they were automated) with potential leads. Magnet emphasized signal quality and lack of required effort from both employers and engineers. Magnet was our main product in 2022 as a last effort before we ran out of runway.</p></li></ul><p>So. With the preliminaries out of the way, why did we fail?</p><h4><strong>We never solved candidate acquisition at scale</strong></h4><p>Companies usually don't fail for a single reason. But if I had to pick one, this would be it.</p><p>Recruiting firms work best when they're working with candidates that are hard to hire. Great engineers, in particular, are hard to hire (and were harder to acquire in 2018 than in 2024) because there are always fewer of them than the market wants - or rather, that's the case for the <em>experienced, skilled, US-based</em> engineers that most US companies are trying to hire. The candidates we most needed to acquire were, by nature, the hardest candidates <em>to</em> acquire.</p><p><em>Some</em> companies (the companies I intend to focus on myself) do want smart people who don’t have much of a resume. But that list is not very long, and (as we’ll see in a moment), Triplebyte wasn’t and couldn’t be satisfied with such a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_addressable_market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TAM</a>. So in practice, seniority mattered a lot. This was especially true after we pivoted from FastTrack to Source, deemphasizing high-touch quality and emphasizing pay-for-access. No one wanted to pay for access to a pool that didn't come pre-filled with the people they already knew they wanted to hire (as opposed to the ones we could tell them they should consider).</p><p>During the 2010s free-money tech boom (senior, US-based, credentialed) engineers did not have trouble finding a job if they wanted one. The slow-motion tech implosion (nice name for a band) of 2022-2023 changed this dynamic, with a glut of engineers on the market after layoffs and company failures, but that wasn't the case for most of Triplebyte's history (and likely will not be the case in the future, at least not until/unless AI meaningfully replaces a large percentage of engineers). For Triplebyte, that meant that convincing sought-after engineers to use Triplebyte instead of their many alternatives was a core problem. And <strong>we never succeeded at doing that at scale.</strong></p><p>Even though early Triplebyte had a well-known and well-liked brand (particularly in the early FastTrack era), and even though we could identify talent the market would otherwise ignore, neither of those things was bringing in enough candidates for Triplebyte to grow at the rate expected of a venture-backed startup.</p><p>Instead, the vast majority of candidates in the FastTrack era - roughly three-quarters - came in from ad campaigns. Any engineer active on Reddit from 2016-2018 is no doubt familiar with Triplebyte Mike (our growth-guy-turned-erstwhile-mascot). Our ad channels saturated to the point that<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/againstTriplebyteMike/" rel="noopener"> organic (hopefully-tongue-in-cheek!) hate subreddits</a> developed purely because people were sick of hearing about us. For all that people loved FastTrack as a product (and people really did), ad spend dominated word of mouth by almost an order of magnitude.</p><p>Worse, ad spend doesn't scale well: each marginal dollar you spend on ads gives you less value than the last. Harj, one of the founders and the CEO at the time, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtzUo6vL3Iw&amp;t=473s" rel="noopener">talked about it for YC</a> as part of a series on mistakes startups make. We scaled ad spend to maintain a targeted growth rate, but this became less and less effective as ads ran into greater and greater diminishing returns. And when those diminishing returns came home to roost, we had no other means by which to scale.</p><p>In short, FastTrack was a viable product at moderate scale (on the order of $10M in revenue a year), but it didn’t have a path to growth. Or at least, it didn't have a path to the kind of growth expected of a VC-backed company in 2018.</p><p>Which brings us to…</p><h4><strong>The catch-22 of venture capital</strong></h4><p>In the days following the pivot from FastTrack to Source, a common lament among engineers was "ugh, another company ruining a viable and valuable business in favor of pursuing growth". The word "<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/" rel="noopener">enshittification</a>" hadn't been popularized yet, but if it had been, that’s the word people would have used. And it would have been (in a broad sense, at least) the <em>right</em> word to use.</p><p>But what I think might be hard to understand from the outside is that (in an appropriate sense) we <em>didn't</em> have a viable business. Yes, it was financially break-even, at times even profitable, even with little focus on optimizing ops costs. Yes, we had a pretty good brand. Yes, engineers loved us and companies liked us. But to understand why it wasn't viable at low-mid-scale, you have to consider how we <em>got</em> to that state in the first place.</p><p>Triplebyte was and is widely known among software engineers. But for all that I'd love to believe that that was because of the wonderful quality of our product, it realistically wasn't. It was ads. A great product can get you a great brand <em>image</em>, but it doesn't create that kind of brand <em>awareness</em> quickly. The overwhelming ad spend described in the previous section made sure it was almost impossible to <em>avoid</em> hearing about us.</p><p>Why were we able to buy those ads? Because investors <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/triplebyte-raises-35m-to-help-engineers-escape-the-bay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave us a lot of money</a>.</p><p>And why do investors give companies a lot of money? On the expectation that they will pursue aggressive growth, not stop at small to middling scale. (This is somewhat less true today than it was in 2015, but it is still mostly true.)</p><p>In short: <strong>if you needed venture capital to produce a viable small-scale business, you didn't really have a viable small-scale business to begin with</strong>. Triplebyte's break-even status was an illusion, predicated on funding that would probably never have existed if that scale were the founders' only ambition.</p><p>I’ll be honest here and say that I don’t know what the ratio of investor pressure to founder ambition was in the decision to pivot to a new product. My personal belief, based on my knowledge of the people involved, is that there was almost certainly at least a little of both. And it's a little hard to separate them - a VC doesn't have to exert any deliberate pressure for an ambitious founder to know that their future chances of funding depend on their success.</p><p>This isn't a shot at venture capitalists. I have <em>plenty</em> of grievances with venture capital and the anticompetitive or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40421669" target="_blank" rel="noopener">robber-baron-ish practices</a> it often creates. There's a reason this section starts with a link to Cory Doctorow. But expecting founders to deliver what they implicitly or explicitly promised is not one of those grievances.</p><p>None of Triplebyte's founders were fools. Harj was actually from Y Combinator itself; Ammon and Guillaume had founded a company before. All three were <em>very</em> familiar with the way venture-backed business is done. They knew exactly what they were getting into and went into it with open eyes, and I do not place any blame on any of them for that. Their ambition was to build a large and disruptive company that would change the way an entire industry is run. And ambition is not evil, even though it often justifies things that are.</p><p>There is nothing inherently wrong with shooting for the moon, even if your rocket blows up halfway. That is literally how we <em>got</em> to the moon.</p><p>But regardless, Triplebyte as defined by FastTrack sat in that catch-22: we needed venture funds to create a viable company, but that viable company did not satisfy investors' growth targets. And in that sense, we did not have a viable company in the first place.</p><p>That meant a pivot to a direction with better growth potential. Unfortunately…</p><h4><strong>We pivoted to a product no one wanted</strong></h4><p>"LinkedIn For Engineers" - that was the by-phrase within Triplebyte for most of 2020 as we shifted into the Source era.</p><p>Job searching on LinkedIn sucks! (True.) Engineers hate LinkedIn! (Often true.) So if we just make a LinkedIn that doesn't suck (uh-oh), everyone should want to use us instead!</p><p>I present it here in a somewhat comedic tone, but this wasn't a ridiculous idea on the face of it. We didn't need to worry about the <a href="https://andrewchen.com/how-to-solve-the-cold-start-problem-for-social-products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cold-start problem</a> (because we already had a bunch of users on both sides of the hiring process) and we were competing against an incumbent people don't like. Again, none of Triplebyte's leadership were stupid, and they didn’t pick that direction arbitrarily.</p><p>Conventional wisdom, and wisdom within the company at the time, was that if you want to disrupt an incumbent, you need to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function" target="_blank" rel="noopener">step function</a> better. The claim was that our skill assessments and our engineer-specific functions could accomplish that. And, again, this wasn't crazy. Our assessments <em>were</em> very, very good. That part wasn’t wrong.</p><p>But the problem was that we couldn’t just be a step function better at <em>something</em>. That can work for a company just starting out (and in fact it’s standard advice for making a great startup), but we were a growth-stage Series B company with a nine-figure valuation. We needed to be a step function better <em>at the core value proposition</em> <em>of our space</em>. And <strong>the core value proposition of LinkedIn isn't "we make finding a job easy and pleasant". It’s "we have all the jobs and all the candidates".</strong> One of the other members of Triplebyte's leadership later on understood this very well, and spent a good chunk of a year trying to get it through my thick skull.</p><p>No one wanted another LinkedIn, because LinkedIn had already perfected its we-have-all-the-jobs-and-all-the-candidates value prop. FastTrack-era Triplebyte had niches LinkedIn couldn't match, but Source-era post-pivot Triplebyte largely lost them.</p><p>Nor was there any particular reason for engineers to seek us out. We’d lost the claim to unlock opportunity, the claim to expedience and convenience for senior engineers, and the claim of human help from a team of friendly and supportive people. We’d lost all the things that (insofar as they ever had) made engineers seek us out. So they didn't. For the remainder of Triplebyte's lifetime, activity on the platform, and value delivered to both candidates and company clients, would be heavily dominated by candidates who had used Triplebyte during the early FastTrack days. This would remain true even years later, when FastTrack candidates were outnumbered three-to-one and were years removed from signing up. Candidates from the FastTrack era were more than an order of magnitude more active up until the very last time I looked at our analytics.</p><p>If you want one reason I'm starting a company inspired by FastTrack: that's it. That's what <a href="https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product-market fit</a> feels like. We broke the thing they loved, pissed them off with anti-privacy decisions, failed to deliver much of any value for years, and they <em>still</em> had so much loyalty to what we'd done for them in the past that they were still our best users.</p><p>Ultimately, the late-Triplebyte product that <em>did</em> partially succeed - Magnet - succeeded by breaking away from the LinkedIn-for-engineers mold and trying to do something fundamentally different, something that LinkedIn does not and cannot do.</p><p>(I won’t talk about Magnet much here, because the proximate reasons for its failure are pretty simple: we ran out of money and the market fell out from under it. It might have - smart money says probably <em>did</em> have - other means of failure, but we didn’t last long enough to find them in any great detail.)</p><p>Still, if we’d had enough of a candidate pool, it’s possible that we could’ve survived as a secondary, auxiliary tool alongside LinkedIn. To do that, we needed a way to build that pool.</p><h4><strong>Our bet on Screen didn't work</strong></h4><p>In 2020, we began to aggressively experiment with a product we called Screen.</p><p>Screen took Triplebyte's assessments (which, again, were as good as we claimed they were) and made them available to companies to use to screen their own candidates. Candidates would apply to a company and the company would use our assessments to screen those candidates, with the understanding that we would present candidates with a chance to sign up for Triplebyte to reuse their assessment scores in the future.</p><p>The idea here was that we could solve candidate acquisition by having companies do it for us. We could just let them use our assessments, at almost zero marginal cost to us, to bring in a constant flow of candidates. And we could do so in a way that served our more moralistic goal of more meritocratic hiring.</p><p>On paper, this worked pretty well. At its peak, Screen brought in tens of thousands of candidates a month, at almost zero marginal cost. By the time Triplebyte closed its doors, our candidate database was heavily dominated by candidates sourced this way. Of our approximately 250,000 accounts at the end, somewhere between 2/3 and 3/4 were Screen-derived.</p><p>And companies loved it! Screen was the only thing that did have market fit for much of Triplebyte's late history. It had a good growth curve, solid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_promoter_score" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPS</a>, and seemed largely inoffensive to candidates going through it as part of a company's hiring process. <em>As a product</em>, Screen was wildly successful (granted, it helps to not be charging anything). If you’d been in any of our company leads meetings during this period, you’d have seen a wall of red “not on pace” quarterly goals with some yellow/green Screen goals being the only thing that came anywhere close).</p><p>But Screen had a problem, one that was not obvious at first glance.</p><p>Remember that fundamental problem I mentioned about forty paragraphs ago? The one where companies came to us (particularly post-pivot) to hire the candidates (senior engineers in the US, especially ones from top schools or with FAANG-like experience) that are hardest to acquire? Well, it turns out that companies also don't feel much need to pre-screen such candidates and want to avoid putting barriers (like, say, an online quiz) in their way.</p><p>The candidates that companies wanted to send through an automated screening step were the candidates that they considered both plentiful and of dubious quality. For most companies, that meant inbound applicants (if you've ever hired before, you know how awful the average inbound candidate is), it meant junior candidates, and it meant candidates from abroad.</p><p>For those use cases, Screen was an excellent fit. It offered a way to trim down the firehose of inbound candidates in a way that actually meaningfully measured knowledge and ability. In fact, usage was so high that a user in India actually crashed our whole web app on Christmas Eve by sending a class of some 15,000 students through it at once. (From a coworker who read over a draft of this post: “I remember this! [Our recruiter/recruiter-liaison] and I were debugging it. He was drunk at a bar, I think.”)</p><p>For a product meant as a growth channel, “we brought in so many candidates it crashed our website” <em>sounds</em> like as clear a win as we could get.</p><p>But remember, our goal wasn't <em>get people to use Screen</em> - our goal was <em>acquire valuable candidates</em>. And unfortunately, the candidate groups brought in by Screen were mostly mutually-exclusive with the US-based senior candidates that our clients were buying Triplebyte subscriptions to find. <strong>We built a database - but not a valuable one.</strong></p><p>Our core metrics didn't take this into account until too late. Our main metric for Screen was simply usage, and that metric looked great. Conversion to accounts was lower, but at around 30-50% it literally could not have been more than a factor of 2 or 3 better. It was only when you looked at downstream results that you'd find trouble brewing. We realized what was going on about seven months into this strategy, in late 2022, but by then it was too late: we'd committed to a path, didn't have runway to pick another, and were already facing much larger and more immediate crises (which, in my anti-defense, were at least partially a result of my own inexperience as a then-new head of product - I don't think I was doing a very good job at the time).</p><p>This problem wasn't the fault of Screen as a product. For quite some time it was literally the only part of Triplebyte that was achieving anything. Users liked it, it delivered value, and it accomplished the product goals it set out to accomplish. It just didn't accomplish its <em>business</em> goals, because it fundamentally did not work for the kind of growth we needed.</p><p>The tactical execution of Screen was fine, but the strategic decision to focus on it was wrong. (Granted, I do not really have a better idea for what we should have done instead. There’s a reason candidate acquisition remains my #1 bullet point here. It's possible that by this point we were simply playing a losing hand with no path to victory.) </p><p>The way it could succeed at its metrics and fail at its business objectives is an example of a classic business lesson: make sure your metrics actually reflect your strategic goals.</p><h4><strong>We tried to change our users</strong></h4><p>The last thing I want to talk about is more abstract. It's a fundamental philosophical difference between Triplebyte and our major competitors.</p><p>Triplebyte was, at its heart, a technical organization. Two of the three founders were engineers themselves, and the company culture bore that DNA. We were a geeky, technical, quantitative, introverted, opinionated company, dominated for better and for worse by that particular kind of intellectual adventurousness that makes the Bay Area a fascinating place to live.</p><p>When we presented an ethos of background-blindness and meritocracy, that wasn't just a brand. It really was the way we thought about things, a spirit that everyone in the company cared about, and that was deeply embedded in company culture. I myself was hired with no tech credentials almost literally off the street. I would eventually myself hire a fantastic employee with no tech background out of an ersatz Home Depot in rural New York thanks to that same ethos. My predecessor on my original team <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/kelsey-piper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is now a journalist at Vox</a>. We were a weird bunch.</p><p><em>(This is not to say that that ethos was never violated. It was. Strategic decisions sometimes overrode it, sometimes in ways I agreed with and sometimes not. But the ethos was still embedded in company culture so strongly that these strategic calls sometimes led to people leaving the company out of loyalty to it.)</em></p><p>In short, we believed, with the specific sort of arrogance that is another thing that makes the Bay Area a fascinating place to live, that <em>we knew how engineering hiring should be done</em>. Our goal was to <em>change what companies wanted to do</em>, not <em>enable them to do they already wanted to do</em>.</p><p>And I don't think this was necessarily wrong. Our users often behaved in ways that I thought - and still think - weren't to their benefit, ways that create painful externalities that make job hunting awful for everyone.</p><p>But this post is called Why Triplebyte <em>Failed</em>, not Where Triplebyte Did Something Wrong.</p><p>Changing user behavior is fundamentally harder than just giving people what they want. And we were always fighting an uphill battle against established hiring patterns. It was a battle our ethos pushed us to fight, but it was often a losing one. We began with the premise that we were right, and that the goal was to convince users that we were right. That’s almost always an uphill battle.</p><p>After Triplebyte closed down, I spent a short time at one of our competitors, helping them get some of the assets they bought from us integrated into their product. I saw a very different approach there. They were an extremely user-, revenue-, and customer-driven organization, as much to a fault in that direction as Triplebyte was in our own direction. They begin with the premise of "what does the user want?" and work backward to get it for them, while Triplebyte began with the premise "what is the <em>right way to do this</em> in the abstract?" and worked backward to convince users to try it.</p><p>One of the key questions in my mind at the time: why were they alive when Triplebyte wasn't? It seemed important to answer that question, and to take philosophies very different from ours with deadly seriousness. And this difference in philosophy is one of the theories I came away with. (The other two are (a) that they simply got luckier with fundraising timing and (b) that, by nature of being an interviewing-as-a-service product, they avoided the candidate-acquisition problem entirely. These theories are not mutually exclusive, and all three may have played a part.)</p><p>In any case, "changing user behavior is extremely hard" is a pretty fundamental piece of product wisdom, and it is what we were trying to do.</p><h4><strong>What you should take from this</strong></h4><p>Doing business is hard. Some of these decisions were mine. Some involved me. Some did not; some of which I agreed with and some of which I hated. And I'm not, for the most part, going to say which is which, because the only thing worse than backseat driving is retroactive-seat driving. There is no shame in trying something hard and coming up short, and that's as true in business as it is <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1daumg4/i_dont_feel_qualified_to_apply_to_any_jobs/l7mxoso/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the job hunt</a>.</p><p>I had more than my share of confident, well-justified, and <em>wrong</em> positions both as a lower-level employee and as a leader. And ultimately, I was a member of the leadership team of a company that failed. The buck has to stop with us, all of us, including me. None of this is about blame, and insofar as there is blame, that blame lies on me as much as anyone.</p><p>But what I hope is that all of this serves as a useful lesson. A bit of fluoride in the water supply of tech, to prevent the decay of the next company that tries to do what we did. A lesson in how a well-beloved company can fail not through any specific cataclysm but by a sequence of factors not obvious in any given moment.</p><p>And for me, a chance to try again.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<article about="/newsroom/irs-makes-direct-file-a-permanent-option-to-file-federal-tax-returns-expanded-access-for-more-taxpayers-planned-for-the-2025-filing-season">

  
    

  
            <div><p>IR-2024-151, May 30, 2024</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Following a successful filing season pilot and feedback from a variety of partners, the Internal Revenue Service announced today that it will make Direct File a permanent option for filing federal tax returns starting in the 2025 tax season.</p>

<p>The agency is exploring ways to expand Direct File to make more taxpayers eligible in the 2025 filing season and beyond by examining options to broaden Direct File’s availability across the nation, including covering more tax situations and inviting all states to partner with Direct File next year.</p>

<p>The IRS plans to announce additional details on the 2025 expansion in the coming months.</p>

<p>The decision follows a highly successful, limited pilot during the 2024 filing season, where 140,803 taxpayers in 12 states filed their taxes using Direct File. The IRS closely analyzed data collected during the pilot, held numerous meetings with diverse groups of stakeholders and gathered feedback from individual Direct File users, state officials and representatives across the tax landscape. The IRS heard directly from hundreds of organizations across the country, more than a hundred members of Congress and from those interested in using Direct File in the future. The IRS has also heard from a limited number of stakeholders who believe the current free electronic filing options provided by third party vendors are adequate.</p>

<p>The IRS will continue data analysis and stakeholder engagement to identify improvements to Direct File; however, initial post-pilot analysis yielded enough information for the decision to make Direct File a permanent filing option. The IRS noted that an early decision on 2025 was critical for planning and programming both for the IRS and for additional states to join the program. IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel recommended to Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen to make Direct File permanent. He cited overwhelming satisfaction from users and improved ease of tax filing among the reasons for his recommendation, which Secretary Yellen has accepted.</p>

<p>“The clear message is that many taxpayers across the nation want the IRS to provide more than one no-cost option for filing electronically,” said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel. “So, starting with the 2025 filing season, the IRS will make Direct File a permanent option for filing federal tax returns. Giving taxpayers additional options strengthens the tax filing system. And adding Direct File to the menu of filing options fits squarely into our effort to make taxes as easy as possible for Americans, including saving time and money.”</p>

<h2>State and eligibility expansion</h2>

<p>Building on the success of the limited pilot – where taxpayers with relatively simple tax situations in 12 states were eligible to use Direct File – the IRS is examining ways to expand eligibility to more taxpayers across the country. For the 2025 filing season, the IRS will work with all states that want to partner with Direct File, and there will be no limit to the number of states that can participate in the coming year. The agency expects several new states will choose to participate.</p>

<p>The IRS is also exploring ways to gradually expand the scope of tax situations supported by Direct File. Over the coming years, the agency’s goal is to expand Direct File to support most common tax situations, with a particular focus on those situations that impact working families. Announcements about new state partners and expanded eligibility are expected in the coming months.</p>

<p>“User experience – both within the product and integration with state tax systems – will continue to be the foundation for Direct File moving forward,” Werfel said. “We will focus, first and foremost, on continuing to get it right. Accuracy and comprehensive tax credit uptake will be paramount concerns to ensure taxpayers file a correct return and get the refund they’re entitled to. And our North Star will be improving the experience of tax filing itself and helping taxpayers meet their obligations as easily and quickly as possible.”</p>

<h2>Direct File’s role in the tax system</h2>

<p>During the agency’s review, many taxpayers told the IRS they want no-cost filing options. Millions of taxpayers who did not live in one of the 12 pilot states visited the Direct File website to learn more about this option or asked live chat assistors to make Direct File available in their state.</p>

<p>As a permanent filing option, Direct File will continue to be one option among many from which taxpayers can choose. It is not meant to replace other important options by tax professionals or commercial software providers, who are critical partners with the IRS in delivering a successful tax system for the nation. The IRS also remains committed to the ongoing relationship with Free File Inc., which has served taxpayers for two decades in the joint effort to provide free commercial software. Earlier this month, the IRS signed a five-year extension with industry to continue Free File.</p>

<p>As the IRS works to expand Direct File, it will also work to strengthen all free filing options for taxpayers, including Free File, the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program (VITA) and the Tax Counseling for the Elderly program (TCE).</p>

<h2>Pilot analysis and feedback</h2>

<p>In the six weeks following the close of the Direct File pilot, the IRS closely analyzed pilot data and gathered feedback from diverse groups of stakeholders, including Direct File users, state officials and representatives across the country’s tax community.</p>

<p>While data analysis and partner engagement are ongoing, the IRS’ post-pilot analysis has yielded three conclusions that support making Direct File a permanent tax filing solution:</p>

<h3>1. Taxpayers overwhelmingly liked using Direct File</h3>

<p>As detailed in the <a data-entity-substitution="pup_linkit_media" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f83f7ed4-d56a-4eee-84e6-12bbc205d7a7" href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5969.pdf" title="0524 Publ 5969                           (PDF)">IRS Direct File Pilot: Filing Season 2024 After Action Report</a><span title="Download pdf file" aria-label="press enter to download pdf file">PDF</span>, more than 15,000 Direct File users participated in the General Services Administration’s Touchpoints survey, which collects comprehensive user feedback about government systems:</p>

<ul><li><strong>90% of respondents</strong> ranked their experience as Excellent or Above Average.</li>
	<li>When asked what they particularly liked, respondents most commonly cited Direct File’s ease of use, trustworthiness and that it was free.</li>
	<li>Additionally, <strong>86% of respondents</strong> said that their experience with Direct File increased their trust in the IRS.</li>
	<li><strong>90% of survey respondents</strong> who used customer support rated that experience as Excellent or Above Average.</li>
</ul><p>For the primary quantitative measure of taxpayer opinions of Direct File, the IRS selected the Net Promoter Score (NPS) customer sentiment metric, which asks users, “On a scale from 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend Direct File to a friend or family member?” NPS scores range from -100-+100. Direct File has a NPS of +74. If compared to benchmark scores from financial services companies, Direct File would lead in eight of nine categories.</p>

<h3>2. Direct File made the tax filing experience easier</h3>

<p>Direct File’s users reported saving time: Filing taxes with Direct File generally took less than an hour, and many reported filing in as little as 30 minutes. Nearly half of Direct File users reported paying for tax preparation the previous year, and the Treasury Department estimates that Direct File users saved $5.6 million in tax preparation fees this filing season.</p>

<h3>3. Direct File helps catalyze the IRS’s digital transformation</h3>

<p>To build Direct File, the IRS assembled a team of experienced tax experts, digital product specialists, engineers and data scientists from across the federal government. The agency partnered with the U.S. Digital Service and GSA’s 18F, as well as private sector partners, who all brought critical agile technology expertise. Working side by side at IRS headquarters and collaborating with remote team members across the country, the Direct File team developed and delivered a strong technology product.</p>

<p>The Direct File pilot also gave the IRS the chance to test customer service innovations on a large scale.</p>

<p>Live Chat served as Direct File’s primary customer support channel because it could be integrated directly into the product. This allowed customer support to gradually expand in concert with the overall number of users in each phase of the pilot. The IRS is exploring how this approach could impact taxpayer service overall as the agency works to provide taxpayers with more choices in how they can interact with the IRS.</p>

<p>“We’re mindful that the most important decision we made during the pilot was to focus on executional certainty,” Werfel said. “We took the time to get it right. We found the right first step to test the demand and the user experience and build a strong product. We will apply that same critical lesson for next year as we take a strategic approach to expanding Direct File’s availability and capabilities.”</p>

                                      <p>Gainax, known for producing the popular anime series "Neon Genesis Evangelion," said Friday that it filed for bankruptcy at Tokyo District Court on May 29.</p>

<p>Founded in 1984, the Tokyo-based company produced hit anime titles, including the Evangelion series by film director Hideaki Anno and "Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water."</p>

<p>Its business conditions began to deteriorate around 2012, due to careless management by executives, and the company lost its anime production capabilities following an exodus of its creative staff. In addition, its representative director was arrested in 2019 for alleged sexual abuse of a minor.</p>

<p>Gainax tried to rebuild itself with the support of Khara, which currently owns the rights to the Evangelion series and of which Anno serves as president. However, Gainax was sued over unpaid debts in May and concluded that it was difficult to continue its business.</p>

<p>Gainax released a statement on its website, saying that it feels very sorry for fans, while expressing its heartfelt gratitude for their support over the past 40 years.</p>

<p>The total amount of liabilities left by the company is unknown, according to credit research firm Teikoku Databank.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The emergence of the microprocessor in the early 1970s allowed the design of computers that did not require the substantial economic resources possessed by large computer companies of that era. Shortly after this event, a variety of computers based on microprocessors appeared in the United States and other developed countries. Unlike in those countries, where small and large companies developed most personal computers, in Mexico, the first microprocessor-based computers were designed within academic institutions. It is little known that Mexican computers of that era include a variety of systems ranging from purpose-specific research and teaching-oriented computers to high-performance personal computers. The goal of this article is to describe in detail some of these Mexican computers designed between the late 1970s and mid-1980s.

				At a time when employee retention should be of a top concern, some companies are using questionable ways of enforcing return-to-office mandates.			</h2>

<p>The battle royale for the future of workplace culture continues as companies and employees square off over the right to work at home and the return to office (RTO) movement.</p>



<p>A sizable list of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1611819/will-employees-bow-down-to-stricter-rto-policies.html">companies elected to order employees back to the office</a>&nbsp;earlier this year. Many directed workers to return to three, four, or five days a week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How’s that turned out so far? Not so well.</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column0 -->
								
					<div>


<p>Companies that think they’ve won the battle by issuing strict return-to-office (RTO) mandates could lose the larger war. RTO mandates are causing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1611739/women-high-performers-and-millennials-flee-return-to-office-policies.html">senior-level employees, women, and millennials</a>&nbsp;among others to push the eject button and find other jobs with companies that have more liberal remote-work polices. If, by some miracle, the Federal Trade Commission’s move to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2098958/ftc-ban-on-non-competes-would-put-employees-in-the-drivers-seat.html">strike down most existing and future non-compete agreements</a>&nbsp;takes effect this year, an increasing number of employees looking for new work could wind up at competitors.</p>

		
		
			


<p>Finding AI talent, which more and more companies are going to need, is already a search for the proverbial needle in a haystack. Adding strict RTO policies to that scenario won’t make the talent search easier.</p>



<p>And while RTO policy pronouncements have slowed in recent months, there have been numerous reports of affected employees searching for new jobs, refusing to comply, and even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/bosses-mandated-them-back-to-the-office-they-took-legal-action-instead/ar-BB1lTAIL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking legal action</a>.</p>

					<div>


<p>Who will blink first?</p>



<h2><strong>Keeping track of&nbsp;&nbsp;employees</strong></h2>



<p>It hasn’t helped that some companies, including Amazon, Dell, Google, JPMorgan, Meta and TikTok, have reportedly begun tracking employees’ badge swipes. Dell is also using VPN (virtual private network) monitoring, and has created a badge color-coding system to categorize employee onsite presence. According to Business Insider, Dell also told workers who work remotely full time that they won’t be eligible for promotions.</p>



<p>It’s difficult to comprehend why some top execs at companies with RTO mandates seem more focused on making their employees suffer with commutes, added costs, lost productivity, and in some cases invasive tracking than they are with making a profit. At some organizations, there’s almost a vindictive quality to the RTO policies and the tone of communications. What possesses CEOs and other leaders to create such a toxic environment at their companies? What is this obsession with making employees work in the office when research has shown that employees are more productive when working where they choose?</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column3 -->
								
					<div>


<h2><strong>The cost of doing business in the office</strong></h2>



<p>One motivation behind employees’ desire for the freedom to work at home involves the financial costs of going into the office. RTO means some sort of commute for employees, which means time and money, especially if you’re a two-income family and two adults have to commute by car. Gas, maintenance, insurance, parking, public transportation, and toll roads are just some of the possible added commute expenses.</p>



<p>Working at home could lead to potentially less expensive, less stressful, and more flexible childcare options. (Many parents with older children are able to drop before- and after-school daycare programs when they work remotely, for example.)</p>



<p>With the likelihood of buying more lunches in the office, and less time to cook dinner after a long commute home, food costs go up, too.</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column4 -->
								
					<div>


<p>All of these considerations add up to a significant drag on work-life balance. The desire to improve that balance is the single most important reason why remote work is so highly prized by employees. The COVID-19 pandemic gave many workers a good long taste of it — and they don’t want to let it go. It makes employees more productive on the job&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;gives them more control over their personal lives.</p>



<p>This is playing out now in companies around the globe. And with neither side willing to give in, the fight will continue to bubble up this year and perhaps even next, leaving employees frustrated and on the hunt for new jobs — and companies in danger of undermining their best assets: their workers.</p>

<p>Burnout can make one feel helpless, incompetent, emotionally exhausted, isolated and cynical. Yale faculty provided insight into the neurobiological basis behind symptoms of burnout — and what can be done to reverse it.</p>



<p>Professor of neuroscience and psychology Amy Arnsten’s decades of research on the effects of stress on the brain were inspired by seeing “how people fall apart,” she said. When her father was very ill, Arnsten witnessed the process by which people who are normally “very rational” can suddenly become “emotional tornadoes.” Through volunteering in her local state psychiatric hospital, she further witnessed how even small stressors had immediate effects on thought patterns. Arnsten found that understanding the effects of stress on the brain would provide vital clues as to how higher brain functioning is regulated.</p>



<p>“A lot of my own research is on how uncontrollable stress affects the prefrontal cortex, which is the most recently evolved part of our brains,” Arnsten said. “It does higher cognition, abstract thought, working memory, the executive functions — so being able to concentrate, multitask, plan and organize, all these things you ideally need to thrive at Yale, for example.”</p>



<p>Arnsten highlighted that a person’s perceived ability to control a stressor is a key determinant of its effect on their brain. For example, if someone is overwhelmed by what is being asked of them, believing it to be beyond their capabilities even if it is not, they will view the task as something to be afraid of and such fear will prevail. The stress signaling pathways engaged will then weaken the prefrontal cortex and strengthen more primitive parts of the brain. According to Arnsten, this phenomenon may have had survival value over the course of human evolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Arnsten recounted walking in the woods in Vermont, when suddenly along the path, a bear appeared in front of her. Luckily, the bear was facing the other way. Rather than consciously reasoning that most mammals lack a ventral stream, and therefore would not be able to recognize a still object, she froze. In this moment of fear, her reflex of freezing was engaged. When the bear turned around, it did not notice her because of her lack of movement, and ended up wandering off.</p>



<p>“Freezing is a reflex that can be mediated by the brainstem,” Arnsten explained. “So you can see that there are many instances where having this rapid switch to more primitive brain circuits can save your life. But there are others where the stressor really demands that you need your prefrontal cortex online. For example, during COVID, being able to imagine an invisible virus, you can’t see it the way you see a bear.”</p>



<p>Human neuroimaging can help researchers study the prefrontal cortex’s specific response to stress, such as the stress students experience before an important exam. Arnsten pointed to a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19139412/">Cornell study</a> that analyzed the brains of medical students after a month of preparation for a major board exam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The month of study for the exam can be characterized as “psychosocial stress,” an imbalance between adverse life situations and one’s ability to cope with them. Brain imaging revealed that the stressor of studying for the major exam weakened the connectivity of the prefrontal network, leading to impaired prefrontal function and impaired attention regulation.</p>



<p>“We can see symptoms of breakdown when we begin to lose our ability to concentrate,” clinical assistant professor of psychiatry Mark Rego said. “We have the tip of the tongue phenomenon, we lose things easily — these are both from working memory breaking down — and our emotions escape their confines into harsh speech. Eventually the system will break down and we will need to rest to focus at all.”</p>



<p>The Cornell study found that after a month of reduced stress, these effects disappeared. In healthy individuals, the plasticity of the prefrontal cortex allowed for such cognitive impairments from stress to be reversed. However, this cycle could threaten long-term mental health.</p>



<p>In Rego’s book “Frontal Fatigue” he hypothesized that if this cycle of mentally breaking down and resting is repeated enough, the prefrontal cortex can become vulnerable to dysfunction, possibly leading to mental disorders. Rego terms this vulnerability “frontal fatigue,” defining it as a background condition caused by the “unique pressures of modern life” overwhelming the prefrontal cortex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rego said that if frontal fatigue represents a state of vulnerability, then burnout is the next step before stress overwhelms an individual into a state of depression. Rego quoted Arnsten’s conclusion that if something is deemed “mental illness,” then it likely involves the prefrontal cortex.</p>



<p>“[The prefrontal cortex] does not function well under stress,” Rego said. “Virtually all imaging and injury studies have found that mental illness always involves the [prefrontal cortex].&nbsp; Change the [prefrontal cortex] and changes in personality and behavior follow.”</p>



<p>According to Rego, without the prefrontal cortex, humans would be unable to control any action compelled by emotion. The prefrontal cortex’s numerous connections to the limbic system, where emotions form, explain its vital role in dealing with “our emotional lives,” he explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Professor of psychology Laurie Santos said that burnout consists of three different phases. The first is emotional exhaustion, characterized by feeling worn out and drained, with not even a good night’s sleep seeming to help. The second phase is known as depersonalization or cynicism. This stage causes a person to be annoyed with others, have a shorter fuse, become more cynical of people’s intentions and become more distant with people.</p>



<p>“The final feature is a reduced sense of personal accomplishment,” Santos said. “You never feel like you’re doing things effectively and so you feel ineffective and like the work you do doesn’t matter. If you notice signs like this, it’s important that you pay attention early on and make some changes in order to feel better.”</p>



<p>Because it is the prefrontal cortex that helps control emotions and thereby avoid panicking, this continual stress cycle can cause a person to spiral downwards. Meanwhile, primitive circuits like the amygdala are strengthened, becoming enlarged as a result of burnout.</p>



<p>“The amygdala’s job is to look for threats,” Arnsten said. “And it’s something called the aversive lens, where people who are depressed, their amygdala actually views neutral faces as sad or threatening. So, yes, by being in chronic stress, you’re setting up your brain to be concentrating on the negative and interpreting things in a negative way.”</p>



<p>Arnsten advised people to have a low threshold for reaching out for help. She observed that many students may not be aware that help is available, and may view asking for help as a personal sign of weakness. She noted the importance of a balanced diet, deep breathing, exercise and good sleep.</p>



<p>Rego emphasized the need to lean into life “with your hands, senses and via others.” To allow the prefrontal cortex to rest, he suggested doing hands-on activities, such as arts and cooking, and indulging the senses — especially in nature — and talking to people often. Rego also recommended quieting the mind, whether through sports, long walks or yoga.</p>



<p>“Understanding the neuroscience can give you perspective to say ‘it’s not that I’m stupid or weak,’” Arnsten said. “This is how our neurobiology is built. This is a natural response of my brain, and I need to do things that will help me feel more in control.”</p>



<p>Students can schedule meetings with counselors at Yale Mental Health &amp; Counseling by calling (203) 432-0290, or access the expanded mental health services through Yale College Community Counseling.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="The Mythical Non-Roboticist"><p><em>The original version of this post by Benjie Holson was published on Substack <a href="https://generalrobots.substack.com/p/the-mythical-non-roboticist" target="_blank">here</a>, and includes </em><em>Benjie’s original comics as <a href="https://generalrobots.substack.com/" target="_blank">part of his series on robots and startups</a>.</em></p><p>
	I worked on this idea for months before I decided it was a mistake. The second time I heard someone mention it, I thought, “That’s strange, these two groups had the same idea. Maybe I should tell them it didn’t work for us.” The third and fourth time I rolled my eyes and ignored it. The fifth time I heard about a group struggling with this mistake, I decided it was worth a blog post all on its own. I call this idea “The Mythical Non-Roboticist.”<br></p><hr><h2>The Mistake</h2><p>
	The idea goes something like this: Programming robots is hard. And there are some people with really arcane skills and PhDs who are really expensive and seem to be required for some reason. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could do <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/robotics/">robotics</a> without them?
	<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> What if everyone could do robotics? That would be great, right? We should make a software framework so that non-roboticists can program robots.
</p><p>
	This idea is so close to a correct idea that it’s hard to tell why it doesn’t work out. On the surface, it’s not 
	<em>wrong</em>: All else being equal, it would be good if programming robots was more accessible. The problem is that we don’t have a good recipe for making working robots. So we don’t know how to make that recipe easier to follow. In order to make things simple, people end up removing things that folks might need, because no one knows for sure what’s absolutely required. It’s like saying you want to invent an invisibility cloak and want to be able to make it from materials you can buy from Home Depot. Sure, that would be nice, but if you invented an invisibility cloak that required some mercury and neodymium to manufacture would you toss the recipe?
</p><p>
	In robotics, this mistake is based on a very true and very real observation: Programming robots 
	<em>is</em> super hard. Famously hard. It would be super great if programming robots was easier. The issue is this: Programming robots has two different kinds of hard parts.
</p><h2>Robots are hard because the world is complicated</h2><p><img alt="Illustration of a robot photo stepping down towards a banana peel." data-rm-shortcode-id="2bbe2d6fffcd94831aabc656e3e81b84" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/illustration-of-a-robot-photo-stepping-down-towards-a-banana-peel.jpg?id=52208546&amp;width=980" height="1563" id="831cc" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/illustration-of-a-robot-photo-stepping-down-towards-a-banana-peel.jpg?id=52208546&amp;width=980" width="2500"><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Moor Studio/Getty Images</small></p><p>
	The first kind of hard part is that robots deal with the real world, imperfectly sensed and imperfectly actuated. Global mutable state is bad programming style because it’s really hard to deal with, but to robot software the entire physical world is global mutable state, and you only get to unreliably observe it and hope your actions approximate what you wanted to achieve. Getting robotics to work at all is often at the very limit of what a person can reason about, and requires the flexibility to employ whatever heuristic might work for your special problem. This is the
	<em> intrinsic </em>complexity of the problem: Robots live in complex worlds, and for every working solution there are millions of solutions that don’t work, and finding the right one is hard, and often very dependent on the task, robot, sensors, and environment.
</p><p>
	Folks look at that challenge, see that it is super hard, and decide that, sure, maybe some fancy roboticist could solve it in one particular scenario, but what about “normal” people? “We should make this possible for non-roboticists” they say. I call these users “Mythical Non-Roboticists” because once they are programming a robot, I feel they 
	<em>become</em> roboticists. Isn’t anyone programming a robot for a purpose a roboticist? Stop gatekeeping, people.
</p><h2>Don’t design for amorphous groups</h2><p>
	I call also them “mythical” because usually the “non-roboticist” implied is a vague, amorphous group. Don’t design for amorphous groups. If you can’t name three real people (that you have talked to) that your API is for, then you are designing for an amorphous group and only amorphous people will like your API.
</p><p>
	And with this hazy group of users in mind (and seeing how difficult everything is), folks think, “Surely we could make this easier for everyone else by papering over these things with simple APIs?”
</p><p>
	No. No you can’t. Stop it.
</p><p>
	You can’t paper over intrinsic complexity with simple APIs because 
	<strong>if your APIs are simple they can’t cover the complexity of the problem</strong>. You will inevitably end up with a beautiful looking API, with calls like “grasp_object” and “approach_person” which demo nicely in a hackathon kickoff but last about 15 minutes of someone actually trying to get some work done. It will turn out that, for their particular application, “grasp_object()” makes 3 or 4 wrong assumptions about “grasp” <em>and</em> “object” and doesn’t work for them at all.
</p><h2>Your users are just as smart as you</h2><p>
	This is made worse by the pervasive assumption that these people are less savvy (read: less intelligent) than the creators of this magical framework.
	<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> That feeling of superiority will cause the designers to cling desperately to their beautiful, simple “grasp_object()”s and resist adding the knobs and arguments needed to cover more use cases and allow the users to customize what they get.
</p><p>
	Ironically this foists a bunch of complexity on to the poor users of the API who have to come up with clever workarounds to get it to work at all.
</p><p><img alt="Illustration of a human and robot hand fitting puzzle pieces together in front of a brain" data-rm-shortcode-id="6bb28ed080b7a6ac68893ee2d530c6da" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/illustration-of-a-human-and-robot-hand-fitting-puzzle-pieces-together-in-front-of-a-brain.jpg?id=52208580&amp;width=980" height="1250" id="7d7e9" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/illustration-of-a-human-and-robot-hand-fitting-puzzle-pieces-together-in-front-of-a-brain.jpg?id=52208580&amp;width=980" width="2000"><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Moor Studio/Getty Images</small></p><p>
	The sad, salty, bitter icing on this cake-of-frustration is that, even if done really well, the goal of this kind of framework would be to expand the group of people who can do the work. And to achieve that, it would sacrifice some performance you can only get by super-specializing your solution to your problem. If we lived in a world where expert roboticists could program robots that worked really well, but there was so much demand for robots that there just wasn’t enough time for those folks to do all the programming, this would be a great solution.
	<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>
	The obvious truth is that (outside of really constrained environments like manufacturing cells) even the very best collection of real bone-fide, card-carrying roboticists working at the best of their ability struggle to get close to a level of performance that makes the robots commercially viable, even with long timelines and mountains of funding.
	<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a> We don’t have <em>any</em> headroom to sacrifice power and effectiveness for ease.
</p><h2>What problem are we solving?</h2><p>
	So should we give up making it easier? Is robotic development available only to a small group of elites with fancy PhDs?
	<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a> No to both! I have worked with tons of undergrad interns who have been completely able to do robotics.<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a> I myself am mostly self-taught in robot programming.<a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a> While there is a lot of intrinsic complexity in making robots work, I don’t think there is any more than, say, video game development.
</p><p>
	In robotics, like in all things, experience helps, some things are teachable, and as you master many areas you can see things start to connect together. These skills are not magical or unique to robotics. We are not as special as we like to think we are.
</p><p>
	But what about making programming robots easier? Remember way back at the beginning of the post when I said that there were two different kinds of hard parts? One is the intrinsic complexity of the problem, and that one will be hard no matter what.
	<a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a> But the second is the incidental complexity, or as I like to call it, the stupid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BS#:~:text=Bullshit%2C%20a%20phrase%20denoting%20something%20worthless" target="_blank">BS</a> complexity.
</p><h2>Stupid BS Complexity</h2><p>
	Robots are asynchronous, distributed, real-time systems with weird hardware. All of that will be hard to configure for stupid BS reasons. Those drivers need to work in the weird flavor of Linux you want for hard real-time for your controls and getting that all set up will be hard for stupid BS reasons. You are abusing Wi-Fi so you can roam seamlessly without interruption but Linux’s Wi-Fi will not want to do that. Your log files are huge and you have to upload them somewhere so they don’t fill up your robot. You’ll need to integrate with some cloud something or other and deal with its stupid BS.
	<a href="#9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p><img alt="An illustration of a robot whose head has exploded off " data-rm-shortcode-id="5d8145dc2ed005a011a7b8cd4d21efe1" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-of-a-robot-whose-head-has-exploded-off.jpg?id=52208747&amp;width=980" height="1250" id="d818f" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-of-a-robot-whose-head-has-exploded-off.jpg?id=52208747&amp;width=980" width="2000"><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Moor Studio/Getty Images</small></p><p>
	There is a ton of crap to deal with before you even get to complexity of dealing with 3D rotation, moving reference frames, time synchronization, messaging protocols. Those things have intrinsic complexity (you have to think about when something was observed and how to reason about it as other things have moved) and stupid BS complexity (There’s a weird bug because someone multiplied two transform matrices in the wrong order and now you’re getting an error message that deep in some protocol a quaternion is not normalized. WTF does that mean?)
	<a href="#10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>
	One of the biggest challenges of robot programming is wading through the sea of stupid BS you need to wrangle in order to 
	<em>start</em> working on your interesting and challenging robotics problem.
</p><p>
	So a simple heuristic to make good APIs is:
</p><p><em>Design your APIs for someone as smart as you, but less tolerant of stupid BS.</em></p><p>
	That feels universal enough that I’m tempted to call it 
	<strong>Holson’s Law of Tolerable API Design</strong>.
</p><p>
	When you are using tools you’ve made, you know them well enough to know the rough edges and how to avoid them.
</p><p>
	But rough edges are things that have to be held in a programmer’s memory while they are using your system. If you insist on making a robotics framework
	<a href="#11"><sup>11</sup></a>, you should strive to make it as powerful as you can with the least amount of stupid BS. Eradicate incidental complexity everywhere you can. You want to make APIs that have maximum flexibility but good defaults. I like python’s default-argument syntax for this because it means you can write APIs that can be used like:
</p><p><img alt="A screenshot of code" data-rm-shortcode-id="49db54aa7c3e3983bd6e628e2ca3cf3a" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-screenshot-of-code.jpg?id=52208798&amp;width=980" height="237" id="e18db" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-screenshot-of-code.jpg?id=52208798&amp;width=980" width="1392"></p><p>
	It is possible to have easy things be simple 
	<em>and</em> allow complex things. And please, please, please don’t make condescending APIs. Thanks!

	3. The exception that might prove the rule is things like traditional manufacturing-cell automation. That is a place where the solutions exist, but the limit to expanding is set up cost.

Reviewed by Sammy Gill.

We won't try to adjust computed font sizes if (visibleWidth &gt;= width())
at RenderBlockFlow::adjustComputedFontSizes.

On the first load, RenderBlockFlow::width is calculated to a value that
allows TextAutoSizing to set new computed font sizes for the text nodes
on the page. Width is much larger than visibleWidth, ultimately coming from
WebPageProxy::textAutosizingWidth which returns WebCore::screenSize().width().

At refresh,RenderBlockFlow::width returns a value that is actually equal
to visibleWidth (and screenSize().width()). There seems to depend on
timing. I wasn't able to reproduce that when simulator CPU load was too
high.

Since the page where the bug manifests itself already has responsive CSS
styling, we can quirk TextAutoSizing to skip adjusting for it, at least
until we figure out why we are calculating RenderBlockFlow width inconsistently:

<p xmlns:plos="http://plos.org">Hegemonic psychiatric models in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, centered on the notion of disease, were willing to consider a single ’natural’ primary cause—either biochemical or neurophysiological–as sufficient explanation for complex psychological and social phenomena like psychosis or depression. The pharmacological treatment of mental health conditions came to be understood solely in terms of metabolic replenishment to fight a putative ’chemical imbalance’, without a true need to delve into the recesses of the patients’ minds and bodies.</p>
<p xmlns:plos="http://plos.org">These overly simplistic models collapsed in the past two decades, and the trend is now the opposite, towards the recognition that mental health conditions are to a large extent, a social construct produced by lifestyles that jeopardize the essential tenets of good health: sleep, nutrition, exercise, introspection, and mind-body connection. Although psychiatric drugs are widely prescribed as ’effective’ treatment, the number of people diagnosed with mental health conditions has increased substantially in the past decades. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the prevalence of mental health conditions has risen from 416 million people in 1990 to over 615 million people in recent years [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref001">1</a>]. Similarly, the U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health has reported significant increases in rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, particularly among young adults, over the past decade [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref002">2</a>]. A significant increase in the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children has also been reported in the U.S. [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref003">3</a>] and other countries. These increases have been attributed to better diagnosis and the increasing prevalence of conditions like anxiety and depression, which likely reflect the negative impact of contemporary lifestyle on mental health. Nevertheless, two other factors often overlooked, may also contribute to explain increase: the iatrogenic effects of psychotropic drugs, and overdiagnosis due to financial conflicts of interest, or prejudice against neurodivergence, as may be the case of ADHD and certain forms of autism.</p>
<p xmlns:plos="http://plos.org">Like Thomas Insel, head of the National Institute of Mental Health for 13 years, publicly acknowledged during the 2017 Psychedelic Science meeting in Oakland, even though psychiatrists feel that they have come a long way in recent decades, patients are drowning in anxiety, depression, despair, and suicide. At the same time, there is a growing interest in traditional holistic practices and therapies, from Yoga, Qigong, and Capoeira, to gardening, meditation, and dreamwork. What is going on?</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section1"><h2>Medicalization should be reduced</h2><p>How can this situation be changed? First, psychiatry must reduce medicalization as a commitment to doing no harm, by engaging in the multidimensional construction of alternatives to the conventional paradigm, which despite being dominant, is ineffective in the face of the complex challenges that involve mental care, such as stigma, social exclusion, and violation of rights. Medicalization reduction works not with the concept of ’disease’, which explains the processes related to health-suffering-care solely in biological, chemical, and physical terms. Instead, it seeks to broaden the understanding of these processes through the dialogue with different sources of knowledge to create therapeutic environments capable of favoring the development of emancipation and autonomy, increasing the possibilities of the person in care to act on the problems and challenges that arise in life without resourcing to mandatory medical treatment, making use of health services only when necessary and focusing on the active participation of the subject in the treatment. Importantly, this approach works with the ’biographical perspective’, a fundamental principle related to the understanding that each person has a story to tell, which expresses the knowledge arising from their own experience.</p>
<p>In its most recent global report on mental health, the World Health Organization (WHO) drew attention to the urgency of transforming mental health care towards providing care based on respect for the rights and dignity of the people assisted: “<em>Around the world</em>, <em>mental health needs are considerable</em>, <em>but responses are insufficient and inadequate</em>” [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref001">1</a>]. An important aspect of the report is the emphasis placed on the importance of lived experience and the presentation of successful stories of medicalization reduction, which include many successful practices documented across several countries from the 1970s onwards, in the wake of the Psychiatric Reform. Consolidated examples of crisis care in Mental Health include the ‘Open Dialogue’ approach [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref004">4</a>], the ‘Soteria Houses’ [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref005">5</a>], and peer-run nursing homes such as ‘Peer Respite’ [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref006">6</a>], which have contributed to the reduction of chronicity, disabilities, and other harmful effects of the conventional ways of treating acute crises and psychic emergencies. Particularly interesting are the practices based on peer support, i.e., on mutual support between people who go through similar health distress and have the objective of enhancing the overcoming of the difficulties brought about by the experience of mental suffering through a relationship of equality, trust, and mutual respect between the participants of the group, i.e., the peers. The individual´s environmental and social setting seems to be the first target that should be addressed in any kind of treatment for mental health.</p>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section2"><h2>Mens sana in corpore sano</h2><p>There must be a change of focus from ‘disease’ to ‘healthy lifestyle’. To a large extent, rather than chemical imbalance in isolation, it is the physiological, hormonal, and psychological imbalance caused by poor sleep, inadequate nutrition, and scant exercise that snowballs into severe individual and social suffering. Psychiatry and other health-related specialties must engage in a consistent effort to rescue the basic tenets of health. There is abundant evidence that poor sleep increases the risks for a plethora of problems ranging from cognitive and emotional impairment to anxiety, depression and withdrawal of human helping [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref007">7</a>]. Fixing bedtime habits to promote better sleep is a simple yet critical step towards improving mental health.</p>
<p>Adequate nutrition is another key factor that often gets overlooked in the pursuit of better mental health. Unhealthy diets based on ultra-processed products, lacking in fibers and fermented food, and contaminated with pesticides and fertilizers, can decrease the microbiome diversity, promote body inflammation, hinder the immune response and lead to various disorders, including anxiety and depression [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref008">8</a>]. It is urgent to incorporate non-processed food, rich in fiber and fermented ingredients, into standard diets across the globe. It is also urgent to end the starvation that reaches nearly 10% of the world’s population.</p>
<p>Regular suitable exercise is the third essential aspect of mental health that often gets neglected. Sedentary lifestyles with little physical activity and much recreational screen time are associated to various mental health risks [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref009">9</a>]. Passive behaviors like watching television have been linked to an increased risk of depression [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref010">10</a>]. Fortunately, even a few minutes per day of moderate to vigorous exercise can have a major positive impact on cognition, mood, and overall health. In particular, non-Western integrative practices such as Yoga and Capoeira show promise to improve cognition, mood and overall well-being [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref011">11</a>,<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref012">12</a>]. Beyond the benefits rooted in the exercise´s characteristics and physiological demands, their practitioners embrace them as a philosophy of life, fostering a sense of belonging and community that promotes a healthy mental environment.</p>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section3"><h2>Inner dialogue is necessary</h2><p>A dialogue with the more visceral and subjective aspects of the mind is crucial for a healthy life, including the key role played by sexuality, and creative activities such as active imagination. A deeper engagement with proprioception, interoception and introspection can greatly catalyze healing processes, broadening self-understanding, and improving well-being. Non-iatrogenic activities such as nature exposure [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref013">13</a>], art therapy [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref014">14</a>], and gardening [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref015">15</a>] are protective against mental suffering. These expressive outlets offer unique, personalized paths towards healing and self-discovery, offering a holistic and integrated approach to psychiatry.</p>
<p>Likewise, the dialogue with discourse-based depth psychology, interrupted for nearly a century, should be resumed. Psychotherapy has proved itself not just as clinically effective, but also essential for treatment of most psychiatric cases [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref016">16</a>]. The quantitative structural analysis of patients’ dreams can offer profound insight into their mental state, as shown to be the case for the early diagnosis of schizophrenia [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref017">17</a>]. The analysis of the emotional content of dream reports, in particular nightmares, can provide valuable insight into different neurological conditions [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref018">18</a>]. Furthermore, automated speech analysis through machine learning can be successfully used to detect and track emotions over time [<a href="#pmen.0000028.ref019">19</a>]. The emotional relevance of dreaming and the clinical effectiveness of talk therapy underscore the need for a multidimensional approach to mental health care, capable of listening attentively to the patients. Discourse analysis at the structural and symbolic levels gives introspective access to deeper layers of the psyche, may help to build the sense of meaning in life, and must be more widely integrated into treatment plans.</p>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section4"><h2>Psychiatry must dream a better society</h2><p>Mental health conditions are often caused by physiological imbalance that is socially constructed. Deficits in sleep, nutrition, exercise, introspection, and other pillars of good mental health do not occur in the vacuum, they are produced by how we live. Precarious working and housing conditions, unemployment, racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, physical and symbolic violence, the war on people that use certain drugs, and other forms of social bias all contribute to mental suffering and need to be considered systemically. The individual’s environmental and social setting must be understood and improved through integrative practices. It is time to strive towards a more naturalistic and benign approach to promoting mental well-being, by strengthening the connections to one’s own body, nature, and community.</p>

<p>As always, there have been a lot of announcements and product reveals at this year’s Computex, but it’s not just the big brands who have a presence at the show, there are plenty of smaller firms fighting for the world’s attention.</p><p>One of those is German PC maker Schenker, which showed off its prototype laptop powered by a Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X Elite chip. While most people would expect Qualcomm’s latest processor to be used to exclusively power Windows systems, given the big push for Copilot+PCs, this developmental model runs Linux and looks destined to be sold by Tuxedo Computers.</p><p>The prototype notebook is housed in a premium all-aluminum body and weighs just 1.36kg. It’s powered by the Snapdragon X Elite which has 12 cores and a 20W TDP. The 14-inch 16:10 IPS display (2560 x 1600) offers 400 nits maximum brightness and 100% sRGB coverage.</p><h2 id="still-some-wrinkles-to-iron-out-3">Still some wrinkles to iron out</h2><p>The Tuxedo prototype comes with 32 GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and storage will be via a M.2-2280 Gen 4 slot. In terms of ports, it offers HDMI and USB4, plus at least two USB-A ports (one on either side), but beyond that we’re not sure, and of course the specs may change in the final version. It comes with a lightweight 50Wh battery.</p><p>There’s no word on pricing or availability as the Linux development project is described as "currently ongoing", hence the prototype tag.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.computerbase.de/2024-06/linux-on-arm-tuxedo-arbeitet-an-notebook-mit-snapdragon-x-elite/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.computerbase.de/2024-06/linux-on-arm-tuxedo-arbeitet-an-notebook-mit-snapdragon-x-elite/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><em>ComputerBase</em></a> took some photos of the laptop at Computex, and observed “The prototype was running Debian when we visited, but it was not bootable and was caught in a loop. There is still a need for much better support for Linux and notebook developers from Qualcomm, whose current focus is entirely on Windows, Copilot+ and AI under Windows.”</p><h3 id="section-more-from-techradar-pro"><span>More from TechRadar Pro</span></h3><ul><li>These are the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-linux-desktop" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-linux-desktop">best Linux desktops</a> around today</li><li>And these are the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/linux-laptops" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/best/linux-laptops">best Linux laptops</a> on offer right now</li><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/us-government-warns-on-critical-linux-security-flaw-urges-users-to-patch-immediately" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/us-government-warns-on-critical-linux-security-flaw-urges-users-to-patch-immediately">US government warns on critical Linux security flaw</a></li></ul><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-syJfWLxdowjrw4Yrp6pJg9"><section><p>Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!</p></section></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>Editor’s Note: This story is the second in a two-part series on 988. This piece addresses issues around privacy and the sharing of the contents of conversations for AI development. The first part addresses the increase in unwanted or coercive police and EMS interventions after 988’s implementation, and can be found here: <a href="https://www.madinamerica.com/2024/06/dramatic-rise-in-police-interventions-on-988-callers/">Dramatic Rise in Police Interventions on 988 Callers.</a></em></p>
<p><span>P</span>eople who call, text, or chat to the new national 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline are regularly greeted with a generic disclaimer that conversations may occasionally be recorded for quality assurance or training purposes. What callers are not told, however, is that their ensuing “confidential” conversation with a counselor in a time of crises may become part of an ever-growing cache of millions of recordings and transcripts of intimate conversations—and be shared, without caller consent, with researchers, AI developers, and corporations for their own undisclosed purposes in a rapidly growing AI industry.</p>
<p>Privacy experts and users themselves are increasingly concerned—and critical of the lack of transparency from <a href="https://988lifeline.org/">988Lifeline</a> administrators <a href="https://www.vibrant.org/">Vibrant Emotional Health</a> (Vibrant), and of the lack of appropriate oversight from the federal <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</a> (SAMHSA). Indeed, call-center privacy policies range from sparse or non-existent to contradictory and downright deceptive about what’s actually occurring with 988 conversation data—and Vibrant and SAMHSA are refusing to even publicly discuss the evident problems.</p>
<p>While aggregated data such as numbers of calls, reasons for calls, and demographic information about callers is generally uncontroversial, the recorded or transcribed content of people’s conversations is much more personal.</p>
<h5><strong>988 privacy policies—and the dubious lack of them</strong></h5>
<p>As part of her work for a forthcoming <a href="https://translifeline.org/hotline/">Trans Lifeline</a> report on crisis hotlines, <a href="https://www.liz-latty.com/">Liz Latty</a> researched the terms of service and privacy policies for 988Lifeline and many of its participating call centers. Her conclusion about their data sharing practices? “At every turn, they distance themselves from clear, direct, concise, concrete communication on any of this,” said Latty. “There’s a huge, willful effort to obscure anything and everything that they’re doing. It’s not an accident.”</p>
<p>Reviewing more than fifty call center websites randomly for this article, and investigating other sources of information, it was difficult not to reach similar conclusions.</p>
<p>The 988Lifeline involves <a href="https://988lifeline.org/crisis-centers-by-state-and-u-s-territory/">200 call centers</a>, and conversation recordings and transcripts are apparently being stored in numerous places—with Vibrant and each call center, and/or with innumerable third-party software platforms that each call center may be using for managing calls, texts, or chats, including <a href="https://www.icarol.com/988-software/">iCarol</a>, <a href="https://www.ringcentral.com/us/en/blog/national-suicide-prevention-lifeline/">RingCentral</a>, <a href="https://coastalcloud.us/client-stories/life-affirming-work-bringing-modern-solutions-to-the-988-national-suicide-prevention-lifeline/">Coastal</a>, and Vibrant’s own “unified platform.”</p>
<p>Yet many call centers had <a href="https://carelinealaska.com/988-2/">no visible privacy policies</a> at all, while others were operated by health care companies that <a href="https://memorial.health/Resources/7ad07ff2-22c9-42af-a531-0e289b760aa1/MH-Privacy-Practices-ENG.pdf">outlined</a> their Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy obligations but didn’t mention 988 data.</p>
<p>Others had policies covering only website visitors—and even those were misleading. <em>The Markup</em> <a href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2023/06/13/suicide-hotlines-promise-anonymity-dozens-of-their-websites-send-sensitive-data-to-facebook">uncovered</a> that dozens of 988 websites covertly included tracking tools, such as buttons for 988-chat that also sent users’ personal information to Facebook.</p>
<p>Contradictory claims were common. For example, Vibrant promoted 988Lifeline as “<a href="https://988lifeline.org/about/">a leader in… mental health crisis care</a>” offering “confidential” conversations with trained counselors. However, Vibrant’s less prominent <a href="https://988lifeline.org/chat-terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>—copied by many 988 call centers—emphasized in large capital letters that talking to a 988 counselor “DOES NOT CONSTITUTE” either “MENTAL HEALTH CARE” or “CONFIDENTIAL” communication.</p>
<p><a href="https://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) counsel Chris Frascella called these latter claims a “red flag” that Vibrant wants to avoid HIPAA’s confidentiality requirements for mental health care records. “The fact that they’re saying it suggests that’s what they’re trying to do,” said Frascella.</p>

<p>SAMHSA’s 988 <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/988/faqs">FAQ</a> claimed that calls are recorded for internal “quality assurance” and “training” only, and Vibrant’s website <a href="https://988lifeline.org/chat-terms-of-service/">stated</a>, “Any information provided by you or collected on you will not be shared or disclosed with any third party.” Yet elsewhere on its website, Vibrant was openly <a href="https://988lifeline.org/research-proposals/">offering access to 988 data to third parties</a> “for research purposes” that could involve <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1521/suli.2007.37.3.291">secretly listening in</a> on conversations, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sltb.12769">reviewing masses of recorded conversations</a>, or cross-linking datasets “that could potentially identify individuals who contacted the 988 Lifeline.” The “<a href="https://988sc.org/crisis-services-policy">Crisis Services Policy</a>” for South Carolina 988 also confirmed that “content of conversations” might be shared with “partners, researchers, or third parties.”</p>

<p>In a joint response to <em>Mad in America</em>, SAMHSA and Vibrant provided assurances that access to personally identifiable information of 988 contacts, such as full names and device numbers, is carefully restricted. But both declined to directly answer any of a dozen other submitted questions about 988 privacy policies and Vibrant’s or any call centers’ sharing or selling of audio or text records of conversations.</p>
<p>Some call centers are definitely profiting.</p>
<h5><strong>Sharing conversation data—the scandal that’s worsening</strong></h5>
<p>In 2022, <em>Politico</em> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/28/suicide-hotline-silicon-valley-privacy-debates-00002617">exposed</a> that the nonprofit Crisis Text Line (CTL) had created <a href="https://loris.ai/">Loris</a>, a for-profit arm developing commercial customer-service software, and had shared with Loris millions of transcripts of conversations with people in crises. An FCC Commissioner <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/carr-letter-ftc-03222022.pdf">urged the Federal Trade Commission</a> to investigate whether CTL had obtained proper informed consent from texters.</p>
<p>CTL claimed the conversations were “<a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/blog/2022/01/31/an-update-on-data-privacy-our-community-and-our-service/">anonymized</a>.” However, while device numbers can be removed, during such crisis conversations people share many intimate—and potentially identity-revealing—details about themselves and their activities, workplaces, schools, family, and relationships.</p>
<p>Amid public outrage, CTL turned off the tap to Loris and published <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/digital-rights/">more transparent policies</a>. Today, though, CTL is a 988 backup center and still <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/data-philosophy/">shares records of conversations</a>&nbsp;with third parties.</p>
<p>Tim Reierson was the person who originally drew media attention to CTL’s commercial data-sharing. Since then, he’s spent much of his spare time <a href="https://reformcrisistextline.com/">researching and advocating</a> for better privacy practices at crisis hotlines. “It’s a calling, that I’m unable to leave or walk away from,” he said.</p>
<figure id="attachment_256970" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-256970"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Picture4-257x300.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="300" srcset="https://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Picture4-257x300.jpg 257w, https://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Picture4-129x150.jpg 129w, https://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Picture4-696x812.jpg 696w, https://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Picture4-150x175.jpg 150w, https://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Picture4-429x500.jpg 429w, https://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Picture4.jpg 762w" sizes="(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-256970">Tim Reierson</figcaption></figure>
<p>Reierson loved volunteering at CTL. He was profoundly affected by texters who were struggling through much more oppressive or abusive circumstances than he’s ever lived through. “The situations that I listened to would keep you awake,” he said. “And it did keep me awake.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Reierson became inspired by the power of connection—how a fellow human simply “being there,” like hand holding, could help people find their own way to a better place. Over time, within him grew feelings of respect, responsibility, and even protectiveness towards these people he’d never met.</p>
<p>Then he learned how these same people were secretly being used by CTL. Reierson said he found it “deeply offensive” and “felt sick, physically so ill” about their being exploited as fodder for commercial machine-learning products—such as in eCommerce customer services and AI feedback on “agent effectiveness” at crisis call centers.</p>
<p>Reierson believes the much-touted notion that AI can learn “techniques” of compassionate human connection—and help or replace call-attendants—is “pseudoscience” and dangerous. “That is where a door is open to the loss of humanity,” said Reierson. “Analyzing a transcript, they are just words or letters put together in a certain order… The ‘being there’ is important. The warmth coming through.”</p>
<p>Even more, he criticizes crisis lines’ “betrayal” and exploitation of users. Reierson described circumstances that can make people, including children, desperately reach out for the one-to-one privacy that crisis hotlines promise—such as threats of domestic abuse, feelings of shame, or fears of public exposure. And then 988Lifeline secretly records these difficult, intensely personal, private confessions and shares them with others for their own purposes. “I have no tolerance for deception,” said Reierson.</p>
<p>Since the CTL scandal, though, these practices have actually—if somewhat surreptitiously—expanded and become embedded <em>within </em>988Lifeline.</p>
<h5><strong>Intimate conversations make the richest AI</strong></h5>
<p>The for-profit company <a href="https://protocallservices.com/">Protocall</a> runs the <a href="https://nmcrisisline.com/">New Mexico Crisis and Access Line 988 service</a> (NMCAL) and, in partnership with <a href="https://www.lyssn.io/">Lyssn</a>, a for-profit developing AI tools for behavioral health, received $2.1 million from the National Institute of Mental Health in 2023. Protocall and Lyssn are <a href="https://www.lyssn.io/nimh-awards-lyssn-first-of-its-kind-988-grant/">using recordings of 988 calls</a> to create software that will purportedly “evaluate the quality of crisis counseling” and teach call-attendants how to “sharpen their skills.”</p>
<p>When I pointed out to Protocall Privacy Officer Laura Schaefer that NMCAL’s <a href="https://nmcrisisline.com/privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a> didn’t disclose how the company handles 988 conversation data, Schaefer said, “We’ve got to do better at that.” Schaefer said that Protocall’s controls on personally identifiable information abide by HIPAA. However, the company doesn’t believe HIPAA applies to recorded conversations. Nevertheless, Schaefer later emailed that Protocall would add a “disclaimer” about using recorded conversations “for research” and would allow individual callers to request that recording be stopped.</p>
<p>The 988 call center Georgia Crisis and Access Line (GCAL) <a href="https://988ga.org/">appeared</a> to be operated by the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities (GDBHDD). GCAL’s website provided no terms of service or privacy policy. It also wasn’t disclosed that, in fact, Georgia’s 988 system is operated by the for-profit company <a href="https://behavioralhealthlink.com/crisis-services/georgia-crisis-and-access-line/">Behavioral Health Link</a> (BHL)—which I discovered only thanks to a tip from Reierson.</p>
<p>GCAL, GCAL’s Steering Committee, GDBHDD’s public affairs office, BHL, and BHL’s privacy officer all did not respond to many messages over months asking about GCAL’s privacy practices.</p>
<p>However, BHL’s own <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240420160314/https:/behavioralhealthlink.com/privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a> said the company is “not a Covered Entity under HIPPA” (sic), and shares data it gathers with “Business Associates”—including <a href="https://www.carelonbehavioralhealth.com/perspectives/anniversary-of-988">Carelon Behavioral Health</a>, subsidiary of the even larger corporate giant <a href="https://www.elevancehealth.com/who-we-are/companies">Elevance Health</a>. Carelon also directly <a href="https://www.nh988.com/">operates New Hampshire 988</a> and has <a href="https://www.carelonresearch.com/">research</a> divisions using crisis conversations in AI tools to help <a href="https://www.carelonbehavioralhealth.com/content/dam/digital/carelon/cbh-assets/documents/global/Why-telebehavioral-health-is-here-to-stay-Comfort-convenience-and-effectiveness.pdf">deliver telehealth</a>. BHL described using caller data for developing <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20221202203617/https:/behavioralhealthlink.com/saas/">voice analysis technology</a> to assess the “emotional state” of callers, to “<a href="https://behavioralhealthlink.com/harnessing-artificial-intelligence-to-revolutionize-behavioral-health-care/">predict potential relapses</a>,” and to <a href="https://behavioralhealthlink.com/behavioral-health-software/">link</a> call center data with people’s electronic health records.</p>
<p>Elevance media liaison Tina Gaines confirmed via email that Carelon has access to GCAL “data systems” with which the company is doing unspecified “work.” She did not answer questions about Carelon’s uses of New Hampshire conversation recordings.</p>
<p>BHL’s research and development lead is <a href="https://behavioralhealthlink.com/about-us/leadership/">John Draper</a>, Vibrant’s former 988 director—and so perhaps a barometer for this burgeoning industry. While acknowledging in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lyTAkRnjRc">recent talk</a> that rampant nonconsensual privacy invasions fueling AI development could “break down public trust,” Draper nevertheless called himself a “huge fan” of Lyssn’s work and expressed enthusiasm about the role that AI can play in the future of crisis care.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/saving-lives-american-988-quality-service-plan.pdf">Report to Congress</a>, SAMHSA said “new technologies” would soon be monitoring calls in “real time” and helping call-attendants flag which callers might be at “imminent risk” of taking their own lives and therefore require police/EMS interventions. Ironically, people who’ve been subjected to such unwanted interventions and have asked for recordings of their calls to mount complaints against 988Lifeline have been told by Vibrant that all recordings are “confidential” and they must obtain court orders to get copies of their own calls. (See part one: <a href="https://www.madinamerica.com/2024/06/dramatic-rise-in-police-interventions-on-988-callers/">Dramatic Rise in Police Interventions on 988 Callers</a>.)</p>
<p>For one of those callers, Elle, learning subsequently about 988Lifeline’s data-sharing practices has been one more way that calling 988 has left her feeling used and abused. “I think it’s vastly inappropriate for them to monetize people’s pain and suffering,” said Elle. “And it feels extremely dystopian, and violative and disgusting.”</p>
<h5><strong>Simple Solutions</strong></h5>
<p>Is Reierson worried about what he sees in 988Lifeline’s privacy policies?</p>
<p>“It’s what I don’t see,” Reierson answered. “We have a basically unregulated environment. There isn’t any restriction on the secondary uses of those conversations. And I feel that SAMHSA and Vibrant Emotional Health, they both are negligent on this issue.”</p>
<p>Jason Kelly of <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF) was also critical. “If I’m a caller of a helpline, I don’t expect that data from the call to be used to create an AI product. These [uses] are just totally off bounds, or should be, and should be very clear in any policy that an organization would have.”</p>
<p>Kelly raised questions about the risks of calling 988 for people seeking abortions or supporting a child’s gender transitions, especially if calls or recordings get transferred to states where those practices are now illegal. “It really makes me nervous,” said Kelly. “That data privacy issue really matters.”</p>
<p>Asked about such cross-state scenarios, Vibrant and SAMHSA declined to respond.</p>
<p>There would seem to be a solution: A brief, straightforward, highly visible privacy policy covering all 988 call centers that actually does what 988Lifeline advertises it does—protect the absolute confidentiality of all callers. Routinely delete recorded conversations within a very limited time. And implement a process for gathering clear, informed consent from both callers and call-attendants for their conversations to be shared for any research projects.</p>
<p>EPIC’s Frascella believes that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) could have cause to weigh in. “If you don’t say something in a privacy policy that you should say, then that is an unfair, deceptive act or practice,” he said. “It’s possible that the FTC might have authority to go after some of these [988] service providers.”</p>
<p>Reierson is especially disturbed by how Vibrant and SAMHSA are characterizing 988Lifeline as <em>not</em> a mental health service—thereby removing public legal protections that exist with health services even as 988Lifeline operates like a health service by providing counseling, keeping records on callers, and instigating police wellness checks and mobile crisis team visits with or without consent. “That makes 988 dangerous,” he said. “If we continue on as we are, these problems of accountability are just going to entrench further.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p> <!-- -->June 9, 2024<!-- --> | <!-- -->20<!-- --> min. read </p><hr><section><p>If you've ever seen a discussion of functional programming languages on the
Internet, you'll have probably noticed one talking point in particular that
comes up frequently. For the sake of generalization, let's make up a
hypothetical functional programming language called Gooby. In these discussions,
often someone will say something like "Oh man, I love writing Gooby. I wish I
could use it at my company or on my team, but it's just so hard to hire Gooby
engineers."</p><p>Inevitably, someone will reply with something like, "You fool! Hiring Gooby
engineers is actually a hidden advantage! Sure, there's less Gooby engineers
than Java or Python or Node.js engineers, but everyone who bothers to learn a
niche language like Gooby is a passionate rockstar 10x engineer! Despite a lower
quantity of people to choose from, the average applicant is of much higher
quality so the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">expected value</a>
from hiring is much higher.  You should use Gooby at your company!"</p><p>I've worked at a company that used a functional programming language pretty
ubiquitously throughout its codebase<span><label for="sn-undefined"></label><span>I'm not going to name the language
itself, because this post would just turn into a flame war over that language
specifically, and I definitely don't want to cast shade on any
language/community in particular. I'm also kind of hoping that the most annoying
people read this and think, "Ah, of course he's talking about <em>that</em> language
over there! This criticism obviously doesn't apply to <em>my</em> perfect and favorite
language!"  Regardless, I feel that the thesis and content of this post applies
pretty evenly to most functional programming languages.</span></span>. I think I
agree with the above thesis - most of my coworkers were extraordinarily smart,
hard-working, and curious people - but I think it leaves out some important
information.</p><p>The fact of the matter is that, when hiring for functional programming languages
(such as Gooby), you're primarily picking from one of three applicant pools:</p><ol>
<li>Résumé-spammers that are applying to any and every job posting they see,
regardless of whether or not they are qualified for the job or have even
heard of Gooby.  There's tough times in the industry so I don't necessarily
fault these people for trying to find work, but it's seriously polluting the
hiring process for everyone else (and has turned the job hunt into an arms
race for producing the highest number of LLM-slop LinkedIn messages and cover
letters). In reality, you're probably not going to hire one of these people.</li>
<li>Bright undergraduates that have just taken their first Programming Languages
course, and have seen the light after their first brush with functional
programming. They believe that Gooby is the One True Way to write software,
and are a textbook example of "zeal of the convert". These people typically
have little production engineering experience and are basing their opinion of
Gooby on a few personal projects, some open-source work, and many blog posts.</li>
<li>Senior engineers who are there for one purpose, and one purpose only - to
write code in Gooby. It doesn't matter what the company does, or if it's
successful, or if Gooby is the right tool for the job. As long as they're
writing Gooby, they're happy.</li>
</ol><p>As mentioned, you're probably not going to hire from Group 1 for reasons that
should be obvious. Group 2, however, can be a source of great potential. If you
can find a motivated and enthusiastic engineer early in their career and train
them in your stack and processes, you've made a great hire. Once the rubber
meets the road and they have to use Gooby in anger<span><label for="sn-undefined"></label><span>I'm not sure who
coined this turn of phrase (maybe <a href="https://erlang-in-anger.com/?ref=blog.janissary.xyz">Fred
Herbert</a>?), but I love
"using X in anger" as a way to describe real-world production use of something.
It's easy for everything to be butterflies and rainbows when you're using a tool
for fun. You can only truly know how you feel about a tool once you've had it
page you at 3AM on a Saturday.</span></span>, they'll probably adopt a more nuanced
opinion of the language and be willing to try something different. If using
Gooby turns out to be a big win for the company, it'll be a pleasant surprise
for everyone. It won't be a huge deal to pivot to something different if not, or
if a new project uses a different stack, or any other scenario where Gooby might
have an uncertain future at your company.</p><p>Group 3, however, is where hiring mistakes are made. On paper, these look like
the best candidates anyone could ask for. They have real-world experience
working with Gooby, they might be the author of popular open source libraries
for Gooby, or even spoke at last year's GoobyCon! They love Gooby, they have
skin in the game, and it shows.</p><p>That's the thing, though. Gooby is just a means to an end; the ultimate end goal
of your company is to write software that is useful to people and makes money.
For the zealots, however, Gooby is the end in and of itself.  No man can serve
two masters, and this is no different.</p></section>
<section><h2>The Problem</h2><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">multi-armed bandit</a> is a
really interesting problem in mathematical optimization. A one-armed bandit is a
sly name for a slot machine - if you pull the arm, you're likely to lose some
money - but a multi-armed bandit is a hypothetical bank of multiple slot
machines, each with a different payout amount and probability of payout.  The
problem is pretty simple: you're a gambler, and you're trying to maximize your
total winnings. The challenge is in balancing the amount of money spent to
determine average payouts of different machines, and the amount of money gained
from exploiting the highest expected value.</p><p>This problem is so interesting, in fact, that during World War II the Allies
proposed air dropping copies of the original paper over Germany. The end result,
or so it was theorized, was that German scientists would be so fascinated and
distracted by the problem that they would abandon the war effort and cripple any
German military research projects in the process.</p><p>I feel like functional programming languages can have the same effect on certain
software engineers. At first, it's just a convenient way to model data flows
immutably or confidently get stuff done with robust type systems.  Then, one
thing leads to another, and you're knee deep in learning about homotopy type
theory or continuations or whatever. Meanwhile, you're a week behind on that
Jira ticket for issuing JSON Web Tokens because there's no actively maintained
JWT libraries for Gooby.</p><p>I don't know if I would go so far as to describe it as an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hazard">infohazard</a>, but it's pretty
darn close. I've seen engineers, to the detriment of their
careers/company/reputation, <em>insist</em> on using a functional language at
every moment possible. I've seen an engineer threaten to quit if their next
project wasn't written in their language of choice. I've seen buggy pre-1.0
libraries used for critical production software<span><label for="sn-undefined"></label><span>Not "critical" as in
"if it goes down it's really annoying", but "critical" as in "checks and stores
passwords" or "moves money from one bank account to another".</span></span> simply
because it was a wrapper library written in a functional language, as opposed to
a more stable library written in an imperative language.  I've seen, more times
than I can count, hand-wavey "wisdom" from the language BDFL used as a kind of
trump-card argument in technical discussions.</p><p>Granted, all of these things independently are personnel issues that should be
solved with managerial means. But in aggregate, they paint a pretty striking
picture of your "ideal" candidate when hiring for a functional programming
language. Yes, you're hiring the most maximally curious engineers.  The
engineers are so curious, in fact, that they'll become enamored with the most
esoteric and arcane tools available to the point of total tunnel vision.  Yes
indeed, you're hiring the most motivated engineers that really Know Their Shit.
These engineers are so motivated, they don't mind wasting a few weeks
reimplementing a protocol that's baked into the standard library of most other
mainstream languages.</p><p>Some engineers - the very engineers that the hiring process is inadvertently
filtering for! - just cannot be trusted to do what's actually productive if it's
at the cost of playing with their favorite intellectual chew toy.</p></section>
<section><h2>The Origin of The Problem</h2><p>A lot of ink has been spilled in the past year or so on the idea of the "<a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp">zero
interest rate phenomenon</a>". If
you're not in the industry or somehow haven't heard of it, the idea is pretty
simple. After the financial crisis of 2008, interest rates in the US were pretty
much rock bottom in order to stimulate economic activity. Due to this, money was
cheap and venture capital could afford to throw money at bad bets fairly often
(as long as their winners were big winners!). As a result, the tech industry was
flush with cash and could tolerate a pretty extreme amount of waste. Watch any
"day in the life of a software engineer" TikTok circa the Peak Good Times of
2021, and you'll get a good sample.</p><p>I think this is a pretty decent hypothesis for the origins of the functional
programming hiring problem. With easy funding and relatively relaxed
expectations on immediate profitability, companies could make poor technical
decisions and slide by being less productive and efficient. As long as they
could come up with semi-defensible tales of future growth, it wasn't a big deal
if they chose the wrong tools to make their products. Meanwhile, the labor
market for engineers became red-hot (for the engineers, that is!). With their
pick of the litter, engineers could be pretty choosy about who they worked for
and what they worked with (and make the big bucks all the same).</p><p>In the fallout of the industry bubble bursting, we're now left with a pretty
bleak scene. Companies that made the fun choice instead of the pragmatic choice
are facing the consequences and being shut down or acquihired for pennies. A lot
of good developers are being laid off, with years of nothing but niche languages
on their résumé<span><label for="sn-undefined"></label><span>A lot of people love to say that they're hiring "good
engineers", rather than "good Java engineers" or "good Rails engineers" or
whatever. That might have held true in better times, but as someone who was
recently on the job hunt, employers are a whole lot pickier nowadays.</span></span>
.  Worst of all, genuinely interesting and innovative programming languages are
being falsely maligned for performing poorly on problems and domains they were
never designed for.</p></section>
<section><h2>Solutions to The Problem</h2><p>This isn't a screed against functional programming languages, or functional
programming in general. I love functional programming! Learning Haskell in my
college days genuinely revolutionized the way I think about programming, and I
got my career started on Clojure. Even in imperative languages, I often reach
for functional patterns to get the job done.</p><p>However, I think that we all need to be a little more honest with ourselves as
software engineers. Is using Gooby <em>really</em> an advantage for you? Does it
<em>actually</em> offer some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(finance)">alpha</a>, or
would you have been just as successful creating the same product in some other
language? Are you <em>sure</em> you don't use Gooby just because it's fun to
write<span><label for="sn-undefined"></label><span>If you answered "no" here, there's no shame! All other things
being equal, I'd rather have fun while writing software.</span></span>?  If you
answered "no" to any of the above questions, your path forward is difficult but
<a href="https://boringtechnology.club/?ref=blog.janissary.xyz">crystal
clear</a>.
If you answered "yes" to every question, reflect a little harder and ask
yourself the same questions again.</p><p>If you <em>still</em> answered "yes" to every question, I have good news and bad news.
The good news is that you have won the lottery. You're one of the few
organizations with a <em>genuine</em> need to use Gooby in production for the unique
advantages that it offers. The bad news is that you are now cursed. You need to
continue using and maintaining Gooby in production, while simultaneously
maintaining a pragmatic engineering culture and preventing a cult of personality
around Gooby from developing. Good luck!</p><p>To the hiring managers of the world, my advice is a bit more draconian.  <strong>Do
not</strong> post your job listings on language-specific job boards, unless you want
the vast majority of your applicants to be language zealots. Filter <strong>very
strongly</strong> for flexibility of thought amongst potential hires - "describe a time
you had to learn something new" or "talk about a time where you realized you
were wrong" are some great questions to ask. Above all, <strong>do not</strong> let the
extremists or zealots into your company.  They are under the memetic influence
of dark programming language design warlocks, and their judgement is clouded.
They will saddle you with technical debt, poison the engineering culture of your
company, and, worst of all, leave you with a nostalgic longing for Java.</p><p>My advice to the language zealots of the world, if they have made it to the end
of this post, is pretty simple. Take a step back, and analyze your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility#Utility_function">utility
function</a>. Are you in
this to make useful things for people, or are you in this to explore what's
possible at the bleeding edge of programming languages? If it's the latter,
perhaps research would be more fulfilling than industry. Academia and private
R&amp;D each have their own (pretty significant) problems, but you'd be free to
explore new ideas and their applications without worrying too much about the
practicality of things. If it's the former, maybe soften your opinions a bit.
Divest the tools you use from your personal and intellectual identity. Question
honestly, and constantly, if the benefits of your tools outweigh their costs.
Meditate on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromwell's_rule">Cromwell's rule</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p>I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible that you may be mistaken.</p></blockquote></div><p>Or, more casually, this wisdom from Tumblr:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.janissary.xyz/hiring-functional-programming/wisdom.png"></figure></section></div></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>The central fact about child rearing by my parents was the equal intellectual status of everyone in the family. My sister and I did not get a vote on the family budget; we were not the ones who had earned the money. But in any disagreement the question was always who had good arguments, not who was older. Many years later I heard an elderly man of whom I had a generally favorable opinion tell a child who had disagreed with him not to contradict his elders. I was shocked — the statement struck me as heresy, very nearly obscenity. If your elders are wrong, you have as much cause to contradict them as they would to contradict you if you were wrong. &nbsp;I thought the older man was correct on the disagreement, but that is a reason to present evidence or argument, not to assert superior status.</p><p>A friend at college told me that someone she knew had met me and my father skiing in Colorado, probably when I was about thirteen. By his account we spent all our time arguing and I won half the arguments. The first half is reasonably accurate but I don’t think my win ratio was actually that high. </p><p>My wife likes to quote the advice “never go to bed with an argument unsettled” as evidence that people confuse “argument” with “quarrel.” I had not been quarreling with my father, I had been engaged in an intellectual exchange with him, part of my education — and his.</p><p><span>Many years later I came across a book by Paul Krugman, </span><em>Peddling Prosperity,</em><span> that started as a defense of left wing economists against right wing economists, morphed into a defense of economists, left and right, against politicians, left and right, misusing their ideas. &nbsp;In it he said something to the effect that my father was a very good debater but sometimes cut corners, chose his arguments on the basis of what conclusion he wanted not what was true. I wrote a letter to Krugman to tell him that, speaking as the world’s leading expert on arguing with Milton Friedman, it wasn’t true.</span></p><p>I tell that story not as evidence that Krugman was wrong — I have offered an assertion, not evidence — but as an example of the effect on me of the approach to child rearing I have described.&nbsp; Krugman was a prominent economist. I did not know him personally, had no reason to think he knew anything about me, but he had written something I had reason to believe was false, so I told him so. One of the benefits of email nowadays is that it makes it easier to do that sort of thing, argue with strangers, than it was then.</p><p>My high school driver’s ed textbook asserted that a head on collision between two cars each going 50 miles an hour had the same effect on each as running into a brick wall at 100 miles an hour. I constructed a simple proof that it could not be true, offered it to the teacher. He responded that he didn’t know but it was what the textbook said; we agreed to take the question to the physics teacher. He insisted that the textbook was right, had no interest in either responding to my proof or offering arguments for his position. I still regret that I did not happen to encounter him after getting my PhD in physics to tell him that by his criterion, educational status not arguments, he was now wrong.</p><p>Many years later the head of the Population Council, wanting to see how someone from the pro-market side of the political spectrum would deal with the issue of population growth, asked me to write a piece on it. Everyone at the time knew that population growth was a bad thing, probably a very bad thing, and most with opinions on the subject knew that one reason poor countries were poor was that they were overpopulated, would get still poorer if their populations continued to grow.</p><p><span>I tried to estimate the externalities, positive and negative, associated with population growth, ways in which a family having one more child would make other people better or worse off. The most obvious candidate, less land and other resources per capita if the number of people increased, was not an externality, at least in a market economy; a child is not born with a deed to a per capita share of the world’s resources clutched in his fist. If he wants land he or his parents will have to buy it, which does not make the rest of the world worse off. I tried to estimate the size of the externalities and concluded that I could not do so accurately enough to sign the sum, to tell whether the net effect was positive or negative.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-144812064" href="https://daviddfriedman.substack.com/p/on-being-brought-up-by-libertarian#footnote-1-144812064" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> As a check on my skepticism of the orthodoxy, I calculated the population density for all of the world’s countries, area divided by population. The five most densely populated were two rich European countries and three poor countries, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, that were rapidly becoming rich. India and China, which people imagined as examples of the problem, had large populations but also large areas so were not densely populated.</span></p><p><span>As some evidence in favor of that approach to orthodoxy, over the next fifty years the population of poor countries continued to grow and they got richer and less hungry, the opposite of the orthodox prediction. When climate change replaced population growth as the looming catastrophe that all of the authorities insisted something should be done about, I took the same approach to that issue and reached the same conclusion.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-144812064" href="https://daviddfriedman.substack.com/p/on-being-brought-up-by-libertarian#footnote-2-144812064" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p>We spent our summers at a house in New Hampshire; my job was mowing the lawn every week or two, and there was a lot of lawn. At some point, probably in my early teens, I started feeling resentful about having to mow it. After thinking about it for a while I concluded that the situation was indeed unfair; I was getting off very lightly considering how much time my mother spent maintaining the household and my father working to support us. &nbsp;I concluded that my feelings were due to adolescence not unfair treatment and warned my father of my unjustified feelings in case any of them showed up in my interactions with him.</p><p>One effect of being brought up as I have described is to make you less willing to be persuaded by bad arguments, even when offered by high status people. Another is to make you more willing to be persuaded by good arguments, even ones nobody else is making.</p><p>One of the things you learn in economics, and life, is the principle of revealed preference: Believe what people do, not what they say. The best evidence that I am giving a truthful account of my view of how I was brought up is how I brought up my children.</p><p>My first marriage broke up shortly after our son was born; he was brought up primarily by his mother and her second husband but, once he was old enough, spent summers with me and my second wife. I too am a libertarian economist and have tried to follow my parents’ example. On one occasion he expressed an opinion on something and one of us asked him what he based it on. He replied that it was just an opinion — why should he have to have a reason for it? One of us responded by asking why he would expect anyone else to be interested in his opinions if he had no reasons to hold them.</p><p>He responded that his other parents didn’t demand that he have reasons for his opinions. One of us, I think my wife, asked him whether, when his other parents made rules, they felt obligated to give reasons for them. He said they didn’t. Did we? Yes. She asked which he preferred, for neither parents nor children to be obliged to give reasons or for both to be. He decided that he preferred the second rule.</p><p>When the Covid pandemic started I was on a speaking trip in Europe. My younger son emailed me urging me to cut the trip short and come home to &nbsp;isolate. My first reaction was to ignore that — I had been alive for more than seventy years and had seen no disease sufficiently dangerous to cancel talks for. My son pointed out that this time was different. His argument was right, mine was wrong; I cancelled, flew home and isolated until vaccines became available. </p><p>Sometimes the kids should win the argument.</p><p><span>Once, long after I became an adult with children of my own, my parents asked me if it would have been better for them to have brought me up in their parents’ religion: Judaism.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-144812064" href="https://daviddfriedman.substack.com/p/on-being-brought-up-by-libertarian#footnote-3-144812064" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span> I replied that I preferred having been brought up in what they believed in: 18</span><sup>th</sup><span> century rationalism, the belief system of Adam Smith and David Hume.</span></p><p>We lived in Chicago, my mother’s parents in Portland, Oregon, so we visited them rarely. The trip by train took three days and two nights. Pullman berths were expensive; my parents planned to sleep in their seats but were willing to buy births for us.</p><p>My father offered me and my sister a choice. We could have berths or we could sit up and have the price of the berths added to our allowance. Both of us chose the money.</p><p>At first glance, the economic argument looks simple, a special case of the usual economic argument for freedom. As became clear when I had children of my own, it was not that simple; not all of the costs were on me and my sister. Small children who don’t get enough sleep become cranky. Cranky children are less pleasant for parents to deal with. There was an externality to our choice.</p><p>Making the choice ourselves and observing the consequences was useful education; educating us was a benefit to our parents. So perhaps there were two externalities, with opposite signs.</p><p><span>That brings me to another story about my older son. We had a friend in Boston who had a New Year’s party every year.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-144812064" href="https://daviddfriedman.substack.com/p/on-being-brought-up-by-libertarian#footnote-4-144812064" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> It started when a friend of hers was killed driving home from a party on New Year’s and she decided to have a party nobody had to drive home from. Food, conversation, music, board games. People slept on couches, or crowded into spare beds, or on the floor; we were young. The next morning someone made breakfast and the party continued. Dinner was spaghetti and meat sauce by one of the regular attenders. The day after that we went home.</span></p><p>It was a very safe environment, a good place to let a child practice being a grownup. We told Patri that we were setting no rules — he was free to go to sleep when he wanted, get up when he wanted, spend his time entirely as he liked. On the third day he told us that he had made an interesting discovery; if he stayed up two nights running he got a headache.</p><p>He was about ten at the time. Most kids don’t discover that until they are in college. Reality is a good teacher.</p><p><span>P.S. It occurs to me that at least one of my readers was also brought up by libertarian economists.

<p><strong>Edit: I want to preface this by saying yes the practices here are very bad and embarrassing (and we've since added robust unit/integration tests and alerting/logging), could/should have been avoided, were human errors beyond anything, and very obvious in hindsight.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This was from a different time under large time constraints at the very earliest stages (first few weeks) of a company. I'm mostly just sharing this as a funny story with unique circumstances surrounding bug reproducibility in prod (due again to our own stupidity) Please read with that in mind</strong></p>

<p>We first turned on monetization for our startup last May. We had low expectations but were pleasantly surprised when we got our first customer within an hour of launching. It was a magical moment. We sent them a thank you, gave each other a toast, and, given we’d just spent two late nights getting everything ready, promptly went to sleep.</p>
<p>We woke up that morning with over 40 gmail notifications of user complaints. E v e r y t h i n g seemed to have set on fire overnight. None of these users could subscribe. We had no idea why.</p>
<h3 id="our-path-to-monetization">Our path to monetization 🛣️</h3><p>For some background, May was the start of the S23 YC batch and we were unsure about the optimal direction to take post launch. Dalton, our YC group partner, advised us to use paying subscribers as a compass and told us to double whatever monthly price we already had in our heads. Eventually (and reluctantly) we landed at $40 a month. Following the meeting, we immediately got to work getting monetization set up. Our project was originally full stack NextJS but we wanted to first migrate everything to Python/FastAPI. We got this done (with some help from ChatGPT), got stripe fully integrated… and then followed this up with five days of the least sleep we’d get the whole month. (Yes five days was a long time to find this bug)</p>
<p>During that stretch of five days, we started to dread waking up—knowing we’d just be greeted with 30/40/50 emails of complaints. I still like to ponder exactly how many customers we lost through this. 50 emails/day x 5 days x <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mn>40</mn><mi>a</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mo>=</mo></mrow></math>10,000 a month in lost sales<strong>—and that was only from people who cared enough to complain.</strong> We’d respond to these emails like clock-work everyday. They would complain about an infinite loading spinner when they clicked subscribe, we’d investigate by opening a new account, verify that subscriptions were completely fine for us, and then carry on with our day confused. Nothing we did would replicate the issue, and even more strangely, we got close to zero complaints throughout our actual working hours.</p>
<h3 id="the-10000-hallucination">The $10,000 hallucination 💰</h3><p>The journey from identifying the issue to actually resolving it felt like it took months. Fast forwarding five days, countless emails, hundreds of sentry logs, long discord messages with stripe engineers, and hours upon hours of staring at five key files later, we found it 🎉. Try to see if you can spot it yourself before reading on.</p>

<p>If you haven’t found it yet, the culprit was a single, innocent looking line. A line that was the bane of our existence for that week. A line that quite literally cost us $10,000. The dreaded line 56.</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/asim-1717965990-0.png" alt="Asim Shrestha"></p>
<p>What happened was that as part of our backend migration, we were translating database models from Prisma/Typescript into Python/SQLAlchemy. This was really tedious. We found that ChatGPT did a pretty exceptional job doing this translation and so we used it for almost the entire migration. We copy pasted the code it generated, saw everything worked fine, tried it in production, saw it also worked, and went on our merry way. At this point however, we still used our Next API for all database insertions. Python was only ever reading from the database. The first time we started actually inserting DB records in Python was when we implemented subscriptions. Though we created completely new SQLAlchemy models during the process by hand, we ended up just copying over the same format that ChatGPT wrote for our existing models. What we failed to notice was that we were copying over the same issue with the way we were generating IDs in all our models.</p>
<h3 id="bug-catching">Bug Catching 🐛</h3><p>The issue with line 56 was that we were just passing in a single hardcoded ID string instead of a function or lambda to generate UUIDs for our records, . This meant that for any given instance of our backend, once a single new user had subscribed and used this ID, no other user could perform the subscription flow again as it resulted in a unique ID collision. This problem became really well hidden because of our backend setup. We had eight ECS tasks on AWS, all running five instances of our backend (overkill, yes we know, but to be fair we had AWS credits). This meant any single user had a pool of potentially 40 unique IDs they could land upon.</p>
<p>During the work day, this was fine. We probably committed 10-20 times a day (directly to main of course) which would cause new backend deployments to occur, giving us 40 new IDs for customers to potentially use. At night however, when we finally stopped making commits (how lazy of us right?), the single ID in every server would get captured and cause all new subscriptions to have ID collisions. Users would start with 40 possible servers that could allow them to subscribe, and quickly end up with near zero as the night progressed. Finally solving this was like a weight being lifted from our shoulders. Adam quickly pushed up the fix after discovering this and for the first time that week we could finally rest easy (well not really since we still had ten other fires but those are stories for another write up).</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion 🤖</h3><p>In retrospect, however painful those five days were, it was one of those startup moments we’ll never forget. Like all startups, we've made a ton of mistakes throughout our journey with this perhaps being the worse. Maybe I'll share some of the rest down the line. We’re just happy that we can now look back at those days and laugh. Yes we should have done more testing. Yes we shouldn't have copy pasted code. Yes we shouldn't have pushed directly to main. Regardless, I don't regret the experience.</p>

                  <p>Like most mac power user tools there are a few versions of most. I'm currently preferring Multitouch.app as it combines:
- Letting me assign 3-finger click to middle-click for opening tabs in chrome (in Safari you can use force touch but I never really liked it, and Chrome doesn't seem to have it)
- Window snapping to half/half, third, etc.. either by dragging to the edge or with keyboard shortcuts. I use keyboard shortcuts for both window splits and thirds on my 34" Ultrawide.</p>

You’re a doctor living in the US? Don’t dare put “check on Mrs. Smith” in there. You’ll need one app for HIPAA things and another for everything else.</p>

I'm almost always on-time for meetings now. It's also included in SetApp.</p><p>SetApp - Mentioning now because I mention below ones included in SetApp, it's a monthly all-you-can-eat subscription to a few hundred mac apps. It's an alternative to purchasing them separately. It may well work out cheaper in the long run to just buy them but it's a useful option.</p><p>Adjust third-party Monitor Brightness - Lunar.app for a standalone tool with the most features (can automate and sync the brightness adjustments with time of day, your laptop monitor, etc). But basic control with the keyboard buttons is possible also from BetterDisplay. DisplayBuddy is another tool in this space. They have varying features and pricepoints.</p><p>BetterDisplay - Enables HiDPI support (e.g. "more space", "more text", etc) on third party displays - makes text size bigger for people that prefer it on 1440p/Ultrawide QHD displays nicer for many and apparently much nicer for 4K displays for most people though I've not used a 4K.</p><p>Multitouch - My current favourite of the various tools that both let you snap windows to the left/right half (or third, etc) PLUS let's you assign three finger click on your touchpad to middle click for opening tabs in Chome. There are a bunch of others apps in these spaces but this is my current favourite in terms of the exact features I need, in 1 app, with a good price point. See also BetterTouchTool (also in SetApp), Rectangle)</p><p>iTerm2 - Mostly I love Terminal.app, except, when screen sharing in chrome it won't share multiple tabs for some reason, plus, it's the only terminal emulator on any platform that supports tmux integration mode so you can open multiple screens on a remote SSH server that appear as physical tabs or windows locally.</p><p>Secretive - Creates SSH keys in the secure enclave that cannot be exfiltrated by Malware, optionally it can either support "No Auth" or require TouchID/Password for each use. I have one of each style, for differing security levels of hosts.</p><p>yubikey-agent - Automates using your YubiKey as an SSH agent and makes it work every time you plug/replug.</p><p>Karabiner Elements - one of a few different ways to make home/end on third-party keyboards work on macOS.</p><p>More commonly known ones: iStat Menus (also in SetApp)</p></div></td></tr>

This sometimes extends into apps as well, like previewing attachments in Outlook or Mail.</p><p>- Preview: This app is much more powerful than it lets on.</p><p>- Markup: Do basic annotation of images or documents in Preview or QuickLook.</p><p>- TextEdit has a plain text mode, I've seen countless "authorities" in Mac education get this wrong. The option to toggle rich text vs plain text is in the Format menu. The settings let you choose the default type of file when you open a new file. It's not going to be your code editor or anything, but it's good to know.</p><p>- Image Capture can pull photos off a camera or iPhone, if you don't want to use Photos, or some random 3rd party app.</p><p>- Script Editor: For a long time this only supported Apple Script, which made me think it was going to die. But they quietly updated it to support Javascript, so you can do some local desktop automation with Javascript now. Thought I don't think it's as well supported as it once was in some of Apple's new apps. Of course Shortcuts is also there for a more visual scripting option.</p><p>- Finder: Show the Path Bar and Status Bar (in the View menu). This used to be the default for the OS, and I think it still should be.</p><p>- Not sure if there is a name for it, but you can copy text out of images and videos. This has been a game changer for me. At work, when someone is sharing a website, I can screenshot the presentation, QuickLook the image, and click on the URL to open it in my browser. I do this almost daily.</p><p>In terms of 3rd party apps...</p><p>- NotePlan: I use this instead of more traditional To Do apps. I can plan based on the year, month, week, or day, with a free form text doc I can arrange how I want, with templates I can design. The files are plain text docs, so I'm not locked in. Obsidian can do something similar with enough plugins, but this seems cleaner to me.</p><p>- Plex/PlexAmp: I have a Plex server running on a NAS. PlexAmp can use used on my mac or phone to play music in my library.</p><p>- Hush: A Safari extension to turn off all those cookie prompts on websites</p><p>- IINA: Video player for when Quicktime can't handle something. I switch away from VLC, because I got so tired of it adding everything to a playlist, and there is no way to turn it off. With IINA I can simple open a file, watch it, and close it. A video player doesn't need to be any more than that.</p><p>- 1Password: Password manager. I've been using it basically forever. They seem to keep up on things pretty well and I haven't been left wanting.</p><p>- Firefox: An alternative to Safari (my primary browser) when I need it. I don't want any Chromium browsers on my system.</p><p>I perged a lot of 3rd party stuff a while back and these are some of the things that made the cut.</p></div></td></tr>

I used to head down the power user road for everything (I used Quicksilver in the pre-Spotlight days, used LaunchBar for a bit, PathFinder, etc), but I like being able to use a system without having to do a ton of setup. It also seemed like the people who had so many little utilities running that they needed yet another utility, like Bartender, to manage their menubar complained about their system being slow a lot. So the less I can run the better. These days something has to be really worth it, I tend to avoid installing something that replaces an OS function if it's just a marginal improvement.</p><p>I've toyed with the idea of not installing any 3rd party apps to see how far that takes me, but that's tough given my current wants/needs.</p><p>Is there a reason you go to Finder to open apps instead of using Launchpad? I throw it down in my dock, and even if I want to avoid the iOS-style full screen menu, a right-click on it works kind of like the start menu in Windows, listing all the apps/folders.</p></div></td></tr>

I honestly don't know why Homebrew suddenly started getting so much attention several years ago, to the point that many devs don't even appear to know that there <i>is</i> another option, when MacPorts is older <i>and</i> doesn't take over an otherwise highly useful directory (/usr/local; MacPorts uses /opt/local).</p></div></td></tr>
