A Short Film in 256 Bytes of Code

Programmed by KilledByAPixel
Presented at Lovebyte Party 2024

...

I found an old VHS tape at a yard sale.
It was labeled "Bitwise Liminal" in sharpie.
But when I watched the video it was only static.

Then I started having vivid and... unsettling dreams.
Also I couldn't stop thinking about that weird VHS tape.
After researching I learned it was a digital backup.
Using some special software I recovered the data.
To my shock, it was a 256 byte program...

With trembling hands I opened it in a web browser.
Strange. This reminds me of the dreams I've been having.
Now I don't need to sleep anymore.
I just keep watching.

<figure><a href="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/world-map-vectortiles.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/world-map-vectortiles-1024x683.png" alt="World map showing pixels in one half, vectors in the other, with an arrow pointing towards vectors" srcset="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/world-map-vectortiles-1024x683.png 1024w, https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/world-map-vectortiles-300x200.png 300w, https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/world-map-vectortiles-768x512.png 768w, https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/world-map-vectortiles-624x416.png 624w, https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/world-map-vectortiles.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>OpenStreetMap will take a large leap forward with the introduction of vector tiles on&nbsp;<a href="http://openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">openstreetmap.org</a>&nbsp;this year. This is the first of a series of blog posts where we will share our progress.</p>



<p>Vector tiles represent a significant advancement in how map data is processed and presented. Unlike traditional raster tiles, which are&nbsp;<a href="https://tile.openstreetmap.org/0/0/0.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">static images</a>&nbsp;with pixels, vector tiles are like the ‚ÄòSVGs‚Äô of the mapping world: you get lines and points. This stores geodata in a format that allows for dynamic styling and interactivity, enabling the user to adapt the visual appearance of the map without altering the data. If that sounds like what you‚Äôve seen on other maps, you are right! Vector tiles have become industry standard in interactive maps that, unlike&nbsp;<a href="http://openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">openstreetmap.org</a>, don‚Äôt get updated often, and where you can simply recalculate your whole database occasionally.</p>



<p>But the map displayed on&nbsp;<a href="http://openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">openstreetmap.org</a>&nbsp;are quite uniquely different! They get updated incrementally and constantly, a minute after you edit; it‚Äôs a critical part of the feedback loop to mappers ‚Äì and how the author of this blog post got hooked in the first place. This is why we have to invest in our own vector tile software stack.</p>



<p>In the direct future, for users, this will mean a new, modern-looking map style with seamless zoom on&nbsp;<a href="http://openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">openstreetmap.org</a>. Looking further ahead, the most exciting part is what this vector tile project will make easy for volunteers and tile users: 3d maps, more efficient data mixing and matching and integration of other datasets, thematic styles, multilingual maps, different views for administrative boundaries, interactive points of interest, more accessible maps for vision-impaired users, and I‚Äôm sure many other ideas that no one has come up with yet. This technology is not just a leap in aesthetics, but also in functionality, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>



<p>To lead our vector tiles project, the OpenStreetMap Foundation has hired Paul Norman, a renowned figure in cartography and open data, whose journey with OpenStreetMap began in 2010 with a chance encounter on the xkcd forums. His role in the community took off with his work on OpenStreetMap Carto in 2013. His volunteer involvement with the OSM Foundation, including contributions to several working groups and a tenure on the OSMF board, highlights his commitment to the project. Professionally, he has held various influential positions at MapQuest, CartoDB, Wikimedia Foundation, and Amazon. Billions have seen the products of his work. To read more from Paul, visit his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paulnorman.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a>&nbsp;for technical deep dives into vector tiles, follow him on&nbsp;<a href="https://en.osm.town/@pnorman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mastodon</a>&nbsp;or on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/penorman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>.</p>



<p>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://osmfoundation.org/w/images/2/27/2021_survey_slides.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2021 community survey</a>&nbsp;(page 15), there was no clear sentiment on what the foundation should do on vector tiles. We noticed a split in preferences: some advocated for volunteer-led development, others for professional engagement. The ecosystem has evolved since then, making it easier to build on top of existing software bricks. We see our project as a reasonable balance between the two most popular answers. Investing in core software is also&nbsp;<a href="https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Strategic_Plan#Strengthen_maintenance_and_feature_development_of_core_software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of our multi-year strategic plan</a>.</p>



<p>The OpenStreetMap Foundation depends on donations to finish this project. If you would like to support our year of vector tiles specifically, you can&nbsp;<a href="https://supporting.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">donate</a>&nbsp;and leave ‚Äòvector tiles‚Äô in the donation message. Every contribution, large or small, directly supports our ability to ensure that OpenStreetMap can be open, accessible and dynamic for all. Your support is not just a donation; it‚Äôs an investment in the future of open-source mapping.</p>



<p>We‚Äôre just at the beginning of this exciting journey. Stay tuned as we will delve deeper into the schema and style aspects in future blog posts.</p>

<p>For the first time ever, I was laid off, and had to find a new software developer job. I managed to find a new one, but it took longer than I thought, and it was a lot of work. I was in contact with 30 companies, got a no from 8 companies,‚ÄÇno reply from 6 companies, and offers from 3 companies. Here is what I learnt from the process.</p>

<h2>Laid Off</h2>



<p>At the end of October last year, I lost my job. I was completely surprised, but in retrospect, maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have been that surprised. The times were getting tougher, and many companies had been laying off people during all of 2023. If the company is not making enough money, eventually there will be layoffs. In my case, we were 17 people let go that day, including 8 developers.</p>



<p>A few minutes after I had the Zoom call with the CEO, my access to all company resources was cut off. Apart from not being able to finish what I was working on (I had several unpushed changes), it becomes harder to say goodbye to everybody. Many of my colleagues reached out on LinkedIn, which was great. Some even set up Zoom calls so we could talk about what had happened, and say a proper goodbye, which I really appreciated.</p>



<p>Being let go was a new experience for me. The closest I have been in the past is during the dot com bust, when the project I was working on at Ericsson was cut. They were not yet laying people off (that came a bit later), so we were offered other roles within Ericsson. But I decided to change to another company instead (they reached out directly to me, since I had worked with of them at Ericsson). All the other times I have changed jobs, it‚Äôs been on my own initiative, while still being employed. I typically stayed on for three months (the standard notice period in Sweden), finishing up what I was working on, before starting at the new company.</p>



<p>The upside of being cut off immediately is that I could immediately spend all of my time looking for a new job, while still getting paid for some time. Even though I was surprised that I was let go, I didn‚Äôt panic. <a href="https://henrikwarne.com/2017/03/12/programmer-career-planning/">My philosophy</a> has always been that I should be prepared to find a new job at any time, since you never know what will happen. So I keep a list of companies that I would like to work at. I also stay friendly with recruiters that contact me, in case I need to get back to them.</p>



<h2>Finding Roles</h2>



<p>I started looking for another job immediately. The best source for this was LinkedIn, but I found some jobs through other means.</p>



<h3>LinkedIn</h3>



<p><strong>Open to work.</strong> The first thing I did was to change my LinkedIn ‚Äúopen to work‚Äù status to <em>‚ÄúImmediately, I‚Äôm actively applying‚Äù</em> (from <em>‚ÄúFlexible, I am casually looking‚Äù</em>, which I normally use). I kept the visibility to recruiters only, not all LinkedIn members (which would set the green <strong>#OpenToWork</strong> photo frame). I have seen arguments for and against using <strong>#OpenToWork</strong> ‚Äì it lets more people know you are looking, versus it makes you look desperate. It is hard to know which is better, but I decided to only let recruiters know.</p>



<p>As soon as I changed this setting, I got contacted by maybe five recruiters per day for the first week or so. I suppose the LinkedIn algorithm alerts recruiters to people that have just changed their status. The quality of the roles was about the same as I normally get (albeit at a much higher rate) ‚Äì some I really liked, some were OK, and some were definitely not for me.</p>



<p><strong>Applying to known companies.</strong> Next, I went through my list of companies I would like to work for, and looked to see if they had any open developer roles. I first looked on the company page on LinkedIn, then clicked on the Jobs tab. Many of the companies were actively recruiting. A good thing when you click on an ad is that you can see how many people have applied, and how old the ad is. Sometimes I would also go to the company home page and look at their career page. But I found it convenient to go through LinkedIn, where the format is the same, and you can see if any of your contacts work there. Sometimes you can also see who has posted the ad.</p>



<p><strong>Job ads.</strong> I also looked through job ads on LinkedIn. There is a search function, and I tried different searches, for example ‚ÄúGolang Stockholm‚Äù. It works well enough, and I would click on anything that looked interesting. LinkedIn also has a ‚ÄúRecommended for you‚Äù-section and ‚ÄúJobs where you‚Äôd be a top applicant‚Äù-section (only if you have Premium), and I guess they use your skills and previous searches to populate these. These also showed a good selection of job ads.</p>



<p>There are however two problems. The first is that searching for fully remote jobs is unreliable. Sometimes it turns up good ads, but sometimes it turns up roles that are e.g. remote only in the UK. It would be good to be able to search for fully remote roles in Sweden, fully remote in EU, or fully remote worldwide.</p>



<p>The second problem is that it is not possible to get only the latest ads, for example ads that are less than a week old. So I ended up having to page through a lot of ads I had already seen. After I had found a new job, I saw a good solution for this in a tweet: use Google, set the time interval to last week, and search for e.g. <em>‚Äúgolang fully remote site:linkedin.com/jobs‚Äù</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Reaching out.</strong> I also reached out to around 15 recruiters that had contacted me on LinkedIn in the past, but nothing came out of that. I knew that the roles they contacted me for would not be open, but I thought that they might be recruiting for something similar. On a few occasions I sent a direct message (InMail) to managers that were recruiting (some encouraged you to do this in their bios), but I don‚Äôt think I got a single response. Perhaps I was not a good enough fit, but it was still disappointing.</p>



<h3>Other Sources</h3>



<p>In Sweden there is a site that is matching developers with employers called <a href="https://demando.io/sv">Demando</a>. You fill out a profile, listing your skills, and giving a minimum salary you will accept. Companies advertise jobs there too, and you get a message if there is a match. I already had an inactive profile there that I activated, setting a relatively high minimum salary. I got contacted by one company there, which I later got an offer from. I also found a job ad there for a company I would like to work for. I did not find that ad on LinkedIn. I applied to them, and got an offer from them too. So pretty good payoff from using that site.</p>



<p>I also briefly looked at a site called <a href="https://remoteok.com/">RemoteOK</a>, but didn‚Äôt find anything that I applied to there. My general sense was that the quality of job ads there was much lower than on LinkedIn. I also had a look at <a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/">Efianancialcareers</a>, but there are almost no fully remote roles there (and they are hard to search for). On the first of every month, there is Hacker News thread called <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=pastMonth&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=Who%27s%20hiring&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=story">Who‚Äôs hiring</a>. I looked there briefly too, but I found it too hard to find something relevant there.</p>



<p>I later found another good way of finding companies to check to see if they have any open roles: google ‚Äúcompetitor to‚Äù or ‚Äúalternative to‚Äù and a company name, to find similar companies.</p>



<h3>Applying and Tracking</h3>



<p>All recruiters I was in contact with asked for my CV, even though it is mostly the same information that is already on my LinkedIn profile. It is almost as if it is a sign that you are serious. This is fine with me, since once I had an up-to-date CV, I just attached that one. When applying to companies directly, most companies ask for a CV (even when including your LinkedIn profile), and many also asked for a cover letter. I saved all the cover letters I wrote, and when I needed to write a new one, I copied the most similar previous one I had, and modified it to fit the new application.</p>



<p>Soon after I started to send out applications, I created an Excel sheet to keep track of my applications. I included company name, date the application was sent, recruiter or contact person, and a column for general notes. Looking at it now, it has 30 entries, but I didn‚Äôt send applications to all of them. In some cases, I added an entry after speaking to a recruiter, but then nothing came of it.</p>



<p>6 companies I applied to never responded at all. In some cases, the ad was more than a month old. But if the ad is no longer relevant, they should take it down instead of leaving it up and not responding. In some cases, I tried to contact the recruiter that had posted the ad, but I didn‚Äôt get a response that way either.</p>



<p>Ideally, all companies should respond. But I don‚Äôt mind too much if I don‚Äôt get a response if I haven‚Äôt been in contact with a person at the company. However, if I have had an interview with them, I think they should at least let you know if they are not interested. At one company, I had an initial interview with a recruiter at the company. She said she would set up an interview with a manager. Then crickets. I mailed her after two weeks, asking what was happening, but didn‚Äôt get a response. Two weeks later, I sent another mail saying I was no longer interested, and got an half-hearted apology back (but no reason for why she never got back to me). So this exchange now colors my view of that company. </p>



<h3>Tools I Paid For</h3>



<p>I have never had <strong>LinkedIn Premium</strong> before, but I decided this was a good time to try it, so I paid for a month. However, it was quite disappointing. Maybe I could see more profile viewers, I am not sure, but it is definitely not showing who all of them are. And even if it had been, it has limited value in a job search. I also got a number of InMails to send each month (maybe 5?). I sent a couple, but they were not very useful for me either. Then there was the ‚ÄúJobs where you‚Äôd be a top applicant‚Äù, but that too wasn‚Äôt very useful for me. So I cancelled after one month. Before cancelling, I had the option of extending it for two months for the price of one.</p>



<p>I also paid for a GoLand license for two months (quite expensive), since I was looking for Go jobs and wanted to practice in an environment I am used to. I signed up for <strong>Github CoPilo</strong>t too, because I wanted to try it. It‚Äôs quite good, but I didn‚Äôt use it much, because I wanted to make sure I did all coding by myself at interviews. I already had a subscription to <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, and that came in very handy for many take-home assignments.</p>



<p>I signed up for <strong>Leetcode </strong>too, as I have done in the past when preparing for interviews. Mostly I like the paid version because you can get the editorial explanation for the solutions. I practiced a bit in Leetcode, so it was worth the expense. One company used an IQ test from Alva labs, so I paid for a practice course called <strong>Alva Logic Cram Course</strong> from 12minprep (there were lots of vendors, but this was relatively cheap). It was definitely worth it, I did much better on the test than I would have, had I not practiced beforehand. </p>



<h3>Reflections</h3>



<p>Times are definitely harder now compared to the previous decade. There were still many open positions to apply for, but it looked like there were many more applicants for each role than in the past. On LinkedIn, where you can see how many applicants there are, many job ads would have more than a hundred applicants. Further evidence of times being tougher is the number of companies that I never heard back from, even though I believe I would be great for the role.</p>



<p>There is also a big focus on having experience in a given language. In the past, I have started a job developing in Python without any Python experience. The same for Golang. It didn‚Äôt take me long to get productive in each language. Partly this is because many imperative languages are very similar. Of course, knowing the libraries and ecosystems is good, but in my experience not strictly necessary. But many recruiters now told me that it was a hard requirement from the hiring companies to have at least two or three years‚Äô experience in the given language.</p>



<h2>The Interview Process</h2>



<p>For a typical job there were four or five interviews: an initial interview with a recruiter, an interview with a hiring manager, one or two technical interviews (either live coding, or going through a take-home assignment). There could also be an interview with a product manager, and/or one with a CTO or founder. All in all, quite a time commitment.</p>



<p>I was applying for both local and remote roles. For the remote ones, all interviews were naturally on Zoom/Meet/Teams. For local jobs in Stockholm, most companies wanted in-person interviews. This caused some problems, because it takes time to travel into the city. I could easily do many remote interviews in a day, but one in-person interview would take half a day with commuting. Mostly I managed to schedule in-person interviews on the same days, which helped. The advantage of the in-person interviews is that you get a better feel for the other person, and you can see what the office looks like.</p>



<h3>Preparations</h3>



<p>Since before, I had a Word document that I called <em>Interview Tips</em>. In it I wrote down things to think about before an interview, in a format that is easy to review quickly. One section I added now was <strong>Behavioral Questions</strong>. These are questions of the form <em>‚ÄúTell me about a time when you disagreed with a coworker. How did you resolve it?‚Äù</em>. Typically, you should answer them using the STAR framework: Situation, Task, Action, Result, Reflection. In the past, I have failed interviews because of these questions ‚Äì I hadn‚Äôt prepared, and couldn‚Äôt come up with good examples on the spot in the interviews.</p>



<p>This time I went through a good list of such questions (<a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leapai/">Rock the Behavioral Interview</a>) from Leetcode, and thought about examples to use. Once I had good examples, I wrote the question and my answer down in the document. Before an interview, I would review what I had written down, so I would be able to come up with good examples. This worked well, I didn‚Äôt fail any interviews because of behavioral questions.</p>



<p>In the document I also wrote down little snippets of code in both Python and Go. I tried to cover many common patterns and idioms. I did this so I could refresh my memory and quickly come up with the right syntax in a coding interview. I ran all the snippets first, to see that I hadn‚Äôt made any mistake, and included relevant output. Reviewing these snippets before an interview made me feel calmer and more prepared.</p>



<p>I also watched a good video by Gergely Orosz, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFOw_m5zNCs">Confessions from a Big Tech Hiring Manager: Tips for Software Engineering Interviews</a>, on technical interviews in general. Some takeaways: be curious and collaborative, and ask questions.</p>



<h3>Interviews</h3>



<p>In all my initial interviews, I was open with the fact that I had been let go from my previous job due to cut backs. I didn‚Äôt seem like disclosing this was to my disadvantage. I was never nervous talking to recruiters or managers ‚Äì I always knew what to say, since I had done it many times, both in the past and for this round of interviews. It is easy for me to articulate what I am looking for in a job, and what my strengths are, because it is very clear in my mind. I was also not nervous before non-coding technical interviews, since I feel I know most technologies I have worked with quite well.</p>



<p>However, I was nervous when I had coding interviews. I don‚Äôt exactly know why, but my brain seems to work at only 50% capacity every time I have to do live coding. So, it can be hard for me to come up with a solution, or remember some syntax, when trying to solve a problem. Luckily, all live coding interviews went well this time, but probably mostly because I had prepared a lot.</p>



<p>Of all non-coding interviews, I failed only one (I failed several coding and take-home assignments though). For the one I failed, I was asked what timeout I would set on a database connection. I was more thinking about how long an individual user could be prepared to wait for a page to render, so blurted out too high of a number. This was enough to fail an interview that otherwise went pretty well.</p>



<h3>Coding Tests</h3>



<p>Compared to when I last interviewed a few years ago, there were more take-home assignments this time. Take-home assignments are a lot less stressful than live coding, but they also take much more time. Regardless of what the companies claim, I would say each assignment took at least six hours. There is an unfortunate asymmetry here: it is easy for a company to demand that you do a take-home assignment early on in the process, with almost no cost in effort to them. For the job-seeker, it is at least six hours of work that may or may not pay off. Even so, I noticed that each time I got going with an assignment, I <em>loved </em>the programming ‚Äì being immersed in a task, structuring the code well, finding good names etc. It was extra obvious because I wasn‚Äôt programming as much as when I had a developer job.</p>



<p>I did five take-home assignments, two in Java, two in Python, and one in Go. I failed one and a half. For the Go assignment, I wrote a working solution, but did not include tests. This wasn‚Äôt stated as a requirement, but I should have included some even so (when developing the solution, I used a more interactive approach, which meant running the code a lot as I developed). That assignment was also failed because I did not include caching to speed it up (to me it was not clear that it would be run more than once though).</p>



<p>The other assignment, I failed because of hidden test cases and sloppy coding from me. The task was really good ‚Äì I was given test cases, but no implementation. I implemented enough of the system to pass all the existing test cases. My instinct told me that I should add more test cases on my own (that‚Äôs what I would have done if this was on the job). However, I thought that I had already spent a lot of time on it, so I didn‚Äôt. When we went through my solution in the interview afterwards, they had run some extra (hidden) test cases on my solution, and discovered two errors in my code. Both had to do with cases with empty input. I felt really stupid for not being more careful implementing the solution. In the end, I still got an offer from that company, and that‚Äôs why I am counting it as only half a failure.</p>



<p>For the take-home assignments, it was quite helpful to have access to ChatGPT. Getting a working framework up for what I wanted to do was a lot quicker that way. </p>



<p>Of the live coding assignments, I passed three and failed two. In the first one I failed, I had to write a limited chess program, that only supported two kinds of pieces. It needed a project structure, a data model, valid movements for the pieces, and tests. I started from nothing, and had to be send the solution in within two hours. It was very tight and stressful. I got most of it working, but not all functionality. I also had a bug in the movement code. That combination made it a fail.</p>



<p>The other live coding was less well prepared from the company. I downloaded a repo from Github with some initial code. But there were no working tests, and it took a while to set up an environment to work in. I also had to ask many questions on how the logic was supposed to work (with 50% of my brain capacity), and in the end I took too long. For all live coding tests, I used the IDE on my computer, and shared the screen over Zoom.</p>



<h2>Salary</h2>



<p>A couple of times in the beginning, I gave too high of a salary number, resulting in cancelled interviews. So I changed my tactics to instead tell them what my salary had been each year for the past four years, to give them a sense of what I was ideally looking at (I had had quite good salaries). Often, they would say ‚Äúwell, we can‚Äôt pay that‚Äù. To this I would respond that since I currently don‚Äôt have a job, I don‚Äôt really have a minimum acceptable salary, it will depend on what they (and others) can offer. This would often mean that we could continue the process. Sometimes it also meant that I had a chance to show what I had to offer, which might later translate to a better offer than they initially intended.</p>



<p>Once I had my first offer, it became easier. Surprisingly often when I asked the companies what the salary range for the role was, I would get an answer. This was really good, because I could say no to the ones that offered less than I was prepared to accept. In one case, it didn‚Äôt check what salary they were prepared to pay. I only found out when I got an offer from them (after a lot of interviews and a take-home assignment). I did this because I really liked the company, but their offer was very low. In hindsight, I should have checked upfront, instead of wasting a lot of time and effort on them.</p>



<p>Even before this job-hunting round, I had quite a good sense of what salaries companies in Stockholm pay developers. It got even better after talking to many companies. In Sweden, you think in terms of the monthly salary. You also have to consider if pension contributions are included or not (in most cases they are included, and can be an additional 10 to 15 percent, which is implicitly included). A very average developer salary would be 55K ‚Äì 65K SEK per month. Almost all companies are prepared to pay that. Getting a salary of 80K a month and over is more difficult, but definitely not impossible, even in a tight market. In addition to salary, many companies can offer options or equity, and/or a bonus.</p>



<p>In the end, you also have to weigh other aspects of the job. How interesting is the product and company? What language will you work in? What will you learn? Who will your colleagues be?</p>



<h2>Choosing</h2>



<p>One company I interviewed with was very positive, and ended up asking for two references, which I provided. But the next day, they announced that they would go with another candidate. I was quite surprised, since I thought I would get an offer from them. It‚Äôs ok if they find somebody else, but I was upset that they wasted the time of two of my references. The recruiter later apologized and said that she was convinced they wanted to give me an offer, but the manager had picked somebody else. I don‚Äôt know‚ÄÇwhat to think, but it was quite a disappointment.</p>



<p>Even if you fail to get offers at most companies you apply to, you only need to have one where you are successful. In a sense it is a numbers game ‚Äì go through enough processes so that you get at least one offer.</p>



<p>In the end, I had three and a half offers to choose from (I didn‚Äôt formally get an offer from one of the companies, mostly because I knew it would pay less than two of the offers I already had, so I am only counting it as a half). I managed to get them more or less at the same time. I tried to slow some companies down, and speed other ones up, by delaying interviews, or being able to have interviews as soon as possible.</p>



<p>I was lucky to have more than one offer, because then I was in a much better negotiating position. The top two offers were both very good, and I could see my self taking either. In the end I got everything I was looking for ‚Äì a very interesting job, and a good salary.</p>



<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>



<p><strong>Stressful.</strong> Looking for a new job is a lot of work. It is hard to relax, even on weekends, because there is always some interview preparation you can do. It wasn‚Äôt until I had a firm job offer that I could enjoy my time off (I had a few weeks off before I started).</p>



<p><strong>Takes time.</strong> I thought it would be quicker to find a new job. But there are four or five interviews to schedule, and often a take-home assignment to do. You also want to read up on the company and product. Then the companies usually can‚Äôt schedule the interviews as fast as you would like. Add that you will fail interviews, and the process can easily take months.</p>



<p><strong>A numbers game.</strong> Even if you fail a lot of interviews, it only takes one company where you are successful for you to have a new job. So apply to many. I also realized that I am bad at judging if I did well or not. Almost every time I was rejected, I was surprised.</p>



<p><strong>People to discuss with.</strong> I have two former colleagues, Patrik and Peter, that I discussed my jobhunting process with. These discussions were really useful. There are so many aspects to consider, and having somebody who understands to talk to helps immensely!</p>



<p><strong>Responsive recruiters.</strong> Recruiters that consistently get back to you quickly are great! It is such a simple way to build confidence in the company they represent, yet so many recruiters really are bad at it.</p>



<p><strong>Reach out.</strong> If a colleague of yours is let go, reach out to them (through LinkedIn or other means) to say goodbye. It meant a lot to me, and I think most people would appreciate it.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I am lucky. I love programming, and I have a lot of experience. Even in a tougher market it was  comparatively easy for me. It still took a lot of work, but I ended up with a great new job as a senior developer at <a href="https://swissblock.net/">Swissblock</a>. I hope my jobhunting experience can be helpful to other developers looking for their next jobs.</p>

And recently, I‚Äôve opened Armstrong‚Äôs Handbook of Human Resource Management Practice to read a few chapters on a problem I‚Äôm facing at work.<p>And WOW a proper book on the topic is SOOO much better than any random article that I find, be it from SWLW, HN, Reddit, or any other source. Articles and posts are easy to like when I already agree with their premise. But the depth of a proper book, from a real source of authority and not some random person online, looking at the problem from multiple points, that‚Äôs so much more insightful and useful.</p><p>So instead of hunting for best articles, I would 100% recommend getting Armstrong, or some textbook. Or at least High Output Management as other comment suggested, or some other well known and well regarded book. But Armstrong in particular can give you very deep understanding of most aspects of people management, plus it‚Äôs up-to-date.

It will do what you say, but not what you mean. Want to increase sales in two quarters? No problem, sales increased. Oh, and we also subtly destroyed our customers's trust. Once the stakes are high, founders basically have to treat their org as an adversarial agent. You might think -- but a good founder will notice!

The other big ones were humility/thoughtfulness, honesty, and grace under pressure.  (Perhaps the original lecture addresses those, as well.)<p>I don't know the research on this (and would be hesitant to believe anything out of the business press about management).  I only have anecdata, intuition, and speculation.</p><p>I'm not perfect at any of these, but they seem to be a really good guide.</p><p>Note that not everyone has picked up the same influences in the past, so they might not have seen all of these, and they might've learned a lot of other ideas.</p><p>For examples of other influences (not just managers, but execs including startups): Many seem to prioritize projecting confidence, over everything else.  Others seem wired to persuade, to doing what they want or to having a positive impression of them, at all costs.  Others seem to think they must assert authority, first and foremost.</p><p>The difference in past experiences, and the reality of industry conventions in practice, means you sometimes have to explain something that seems obvious to you.</p><p>One time I failed to communicate well, I was characterizing to a startup CEO how I'd run a forthcoming engineering team, and I added something at the end, "and they'll be my people".  I intended it as shorthand for a style of conscientiously looking after their needs, and fostering a culture of loyalty to the team/project/company.  Of course that was ambiguous, especially in a business context, where aggressive self-interest is the most likely explanation for any behavior.  Later, I realized that he was looking to be the leader of more of a lifestyle company, with the entire company <i>his</i> people in a somewhat different sense (which was an influence he'd seen in his own career).  So I'd maybe sounded like I was saying I'd silo off a fiefdom of loyalists to me rather than to him or the company, shape part of the company in my image, or otherwise get between him and the people.

Everyone in a corporate structure is a servant.  How you advance is by demonstrating that you are helping solve the problems deemed important by your chain of command.  Theoretically this should be aligned from top to bottom; in practice competing priorities, communication overhead, and incompetence in the wrong places can greatly distort things.  This reality leads a lot of folks into learned helplessness, and social climbers gaming the chaos to gain power they are not equipped to handle.<p>The mentality "what's in it for me" is toxic and shows one is not ready for higher level management in a large org where cooperation is necessary to do anything interesting.  Better questions are "is my team working on the right thing?", "does my team have the right skills to deliver on that thing?", "what relationships do we need to succeed?", and last but definitely not least "is my manager competent enough to provide the support I need for my team to be successful?".  The last question is the key one: you won't grow if you are reporting to a muppet.

You're right that it's not inherently toxic to think of yourself.  The reason I reacted that way is because that mentality (whether explicit or not) is what leads to operating in a very transactional way or empire-building fashion that works against good outcomes in the long-term.<p>I honestly don't think being too selfless is an adequate explanation for career stagnation though.  Selfless behavior will generally help you get ahead in life and in your career, because good relationships matter a lot.  However you won't get promoted just because you help everyone.  What if you are just servicing the squeaky wheels rather than solving the biggest problem on your plate?  A good manager will only look to promote you because you have demonstrated you are capable of solving larger problems.  There are other things too: like the business actually has the need for a higher level role.  If that's the case, then your behavior is irrelevant‚Äîyou just need to leave to someplace that <i>does</i> have the growth opportunity.</p><p>Overall the reason I said your comment was strange is because it clearly comes from some personal experience you had, but it lacks enough context to be actionable to anyone who reads it.  I can think of a dozen different ways I've seen a "servant leader" mentality succeed or fail, but it all depends very much on context.  Ultimately if you want to succeed you need to understand what game is being played and not fallback to abstract platitudes.

In a healthy engineering culture, a management goal should be enabling the maximum number of people to exercise their own leadership. Even the newfangled concept of "servant leadership" is premised on a separation of agency between those who "serve/lead" and those who "are served/led".<p>Effective management --- do not groan before I finish this sentence --- tends to look a lot more like adminship on Wikipedia than it does, like, war leadership. It's about picking up a mop and a bucket and making the way clear for people to do their best work. And, in our field, doing one's best work often means <i>making and communicating big decisions</i>, which is what leadership is.</p><p>There's also a distinction between the kind of leadership the whole company needs --- hard decisions about where to allocate resources and what bets to make --- and the day-to-day "leadership" involved in getting things done as a team. I term I hear a lot is "vibes based management", which is a recognition that somebody (probably not engineering management!) is making these kinds of decisions and communicating them just well enough for line engineers to make good choices.</p><p>If you're looking for management advice because you're running a whole company, that kind of leadership is in scope! But if you're looking to learn how to be a good engineering manager, I'm not sure how much "leadership" has to do with doing a good job.

          <p><time datetime="2024-02-10T00:00:00+00:00">February 10, 2024</time> ¬∑ <span title="Estimated read time">1 minute read</span>
          </p>

          <p>Why <a href="https://stephango.com/obsidian">Obsidian</a> is 100% user-supported and not backed by VC investors:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We want to stay small, we don‚Äôt need to hire lots of people</li>
  <li>We follow strict principles that we do not want to compromise</li>
  <li>Our users are happy to support us, we don‚Äôt need VC money</li>
</ol>

<p>Obsidian will not exist forever, no app will. However, the <a href="https://stephango.com/file-over-app">files you create</a> in Obsidian are yours, and can hopefully last for generations. VCware is built with a five year horizon, it is not built to live on for decades.</p>

<p>Many startup founders raise VC money because they need the upfront capital to build their product, or they see it as a shortcut to growth. For some products the capital truly is necessary, but too often it‚Äôs fueled by impatience and the inertia of Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>In the short term, VCware tends to <a href="https://stephango.com/quality-software">subsidize pricing</a> to acquire users. It‚Äôs easier to grow if your product is cheap or free. But this generally comes at the cost of hoarding user data, and locking in customers. Once you‚Äôre in you can‚Äôt get out.</p>

<p>To keep raising money, VCware must paint an increasingly enormous vision of their future, which becomes impossible to live up to. This leads to increasingly disparate priorities that gradually make the product worse. What starts off as a useful app becomes burdened with crap.</p>

<p>Eventually all VCware must exit. That means being acquired or going public to pay back investors. It‚Äôs expected that 9 out 10 startups will fail. That‚Äôs just part of the math in a VC portfolio. The startups that have big exits pay for the ones that fail.</p>

<p>It is now possible for tiny teams to make principled software that millions of people use, unburdened by investors. Principled apps that put people in control of their data, their privacy, their wellbeing. These principles can be irrevocably built into the architecture of the app.</p>

<p>Principled people have always been able to make principled software. The difference is that now you need far less money and far fewer employees to reach far more customers. That wave is only just beginning.</p>

<p>If you have principles and enough patience, being 100% user-supported is by far the most fun way to build.</p>

	<div>
<p>This cube manages to balance itself on a corner, and can simultaneously rotate around its axis in a controlled manner. It does so using clever controls and a set of three reaction wheels.</p>



<p>The original idea for this device comes from researchers at ETH Z√ºrich, who demonstrate their ‚ÄúCubli‚Äù in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_6p-1J551Y" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_6p-1J551Y">this video</a>. Its design has been improved in some ways in later years. Notably, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWEWNBDW6CM" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWEWNBDW6CM">Bobrow et al</a> (University of S√£o Paolo) introduce an improved controls concept, reducing the number of required IMUs (inertial measurement units) to just one instead of six.</p>



<p>I decided to pursue the challenge of building one myself. Even though the idea isn‚Äôt new, previous works are largely closed-source. I plan to change that. This means that I had to reverse-engineer and draw everything from scratch. The result of my work, which is completely open source (<a href="https://github.com/willem-pennings/balancing-cube">GitHub</a>), is shown in the video below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>You might think: <strong>ANOTHER USELESS MACHINE?!</strong> When I published my <a href="https://willempennings.nl/mms-and-skittles-sorting-machine/" data-type="post" data-id="95">M&amp;Ms sorting machine</a>, I received lots of similar remarks. Indeed, it has no practical value, but similar applications such as sorting of fruits, vegetables and nuts based on colour do. For this cube, the situation is similar: while this is mostly a great learning experience and research project, reaction wheels are often used in satellites (such as the James Webb telescope) for attitude control purposes.</p>


<div>

<h2>Mechanical design</h2>



<p>The mechanical design of this cube is mostly the same as that of the original Cubli, but it has some subtle differences. The main structure consists of eight ‚Äúcornerstones‚Äù and six face plates. Three of these face plates have additional features to support a motor and reaction wheel assembly. All parts were drawn in (con)Fusion 360. My student days are over, so I had to say farewell to Siemens NX. The latter isn‚Äôt used much (if at all?) in the DIY community anyway, so I can share my designs with others more easily now.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="680" height="768" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cad-assembly-mechanical.png" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cad-assembly-mechanical.png 680w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cad-assembly-mechanical-266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"></figure></div>


<p>Most structural parts are made of stainless steel for its excellent strength. The faceplates are made of aluminium to save weight. These don‚Äôt need to be made of steel since the assembled structure will be more than stiff enough when made of aluminium anyway.</p>



<p>All metal parts in this project have been manufactured by <a href="https://www.pcbway.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pcbway.com/">PCBWay</a>. I‚Äôve used their PCB prototyping service before and was interested in their CNC capabilities. Part of the cost for these parts was sponsored by PCBWay. The ordering process was straightforward and I like that a quote was automatically calculated directly after uploading the part and specifying the material type. I‚Äôm satisfied with the parts and their quality: a small production issue was quickly resolved and all parts fit together without issue. Pictures below: judge for yourself.</p>



<p>I had fun with the design of the motor and flywheel assembly. I was looking for a robust design ‚Äì after all, the wheels can reach speeds up to 6000 rounds per minute ‚Äì while also keeping it lightweight. Even though I‚Äôm a mechanical engineer by education, construction principles aren‚Äôt my main strength, but after all that‚Äôs the reason for projects like these: to learn! I finally came up with the following.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>The motor is connected to a stainless steel bridge using three countersunk screws. The bridge eventually connects to one of the aluminium faceplates.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>A small hub is mounted onto the shaft of the motor and secured using three set screws. This hub is critical: if the center hole is not perpendicular with respect to the flat triangular face, the wheel will not be aligned with the motor shaft, causing vibrations and wear.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>A reaction wheel is mounted onto the hub using three countersunk screws. This step requires a bit of trial and error to correct for imperfections in the hub and wheel, which may cause the misalignments I mentioned earlier. I resolve these by placing tiny pieces of paper between the horizontal contact surface of the hub and wheel and this provides satisfactory results. After all, these parts aren‚Äôt taken apart very often.</p>

<p>A small radial ball bearing is inserted into one of the faceplates and secured using cyanoacrylate (‚Äúsuper‚Äù) glue. This ball bearing will support one end of the motor shaft. The other end of the shaft is also supported by a bearing within the motor itself.</p>


<div>

<p>Finally, the motor shaft is inserted into the bearing and the bridge is connected to the faceplate using four bolts. This process is repeated two more times.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>This result in half a cube. The remaining faceplates don‚Äôt require any special assembly steps and can be directly assembled. Notice how one of the motors is oriented differently with respect to the bridge to which it attaches? That is done on purpose: it simplifies the cabling work later on.</p>

<p>The result is a strong yet relatively lightweight structure. The aluminium faceplates are relatively weak by themselves, but won‚Äôt budge when assembled together.</p>



<h2>Electromechanical design</h2>



<p>For the motor and motor controllers, other balancing cubes use Maxon motors from the ‚Äú<a href="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/content/ec-flat-motors" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/content/ec-flat-motors">EC flat</a>‚Äù series. While it‚Äôs possible to find cheaper alternatives, the motors and their controllers are critical parts and I don‚Äôt want to skimp on them. The cube will balance by applying torques to the motors. Many DC motors do not even come with datasheets that specify the torque constant (which defines the relationship between torque and current), and many brushless motor controllers such as ESCs only offer speed control, but not current control. Both are essential in making this project a reality, so the choice for components of high quality is obvious here.</p>


<div>

<p>I selected a 60 W <a href="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/591477" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/591477">motor</a> and a compatible 4-quadrant <a href="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/control/4-Q-Servokontroller/466023" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/control/4-Q-Servokontroller/466023">motor controller</a> which can deliver currents up to 6 A. At 24 V, this corresponds to almost 150 W. While this is well beyond the nominal power rating of the motor, it is no problem to briefly overload the motor. Moreover, the controller has a built-in I2t algorithm which limits current to the motor if the winding temperature is estimated to become too high. It is unlikely that the cube hits these limits in normal operation anyway, because currents are generally very low while balancing.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="940" height="499" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/escon.png" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/escon.png 940w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/escon-300x159.png 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/escon-768x408.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></figure></div>


<p>The software that comes with the Escon motor controllers is pretty great. There are motor commissioning and tuning tools and a nice dashboard showing the status of the motor and its inputs/outputs during operation (shown in the screenshot above).</p>



<p>For the battery, I chose a 6S1P lithium-polymer battery. The motors are rated for 24 V so a six-cell LiPo battery (nominal voltage 22.2 V) is a good fit here. The battery has a capacity of 1300 mAh (29 Wh) which is enough to run the cube for at least an hour, normally.</p>

<p>The motherboard is a custom design and integrates the three motor controllers, IMU (hidden), ESP32-S3 development board, and some supporting components such as protection circuits and voltage regulators. The board also anticipates adding mechanical brakes to the cube, by providing outputs for RC servo motors. Mechanical brakes will enable the cube to jump up to the balancing position by itself. I haven‚Äôt finished the development of the brake design yet.</p>

<p>Assembling the circuit board was fun. I started by applying solder paste and placing the surface-mount parts. After reflowing it in a small toaster oven (more details about how this works <a href="https://willempennings.nl/miniature-3456-led-cube/" data-type="post" data-id="48">here</a>), I soldered all the through hole parts by hand.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="708" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-25-1024x708.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-25-1024x708.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-25-300x207.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-25-768x531.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-25-1536x1061.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-25-1568x1083.jpg 1568w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-25.jpg 1673w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>Later, during integration and testing of the various components, I found that I had made a few small routing errors which I quickly corrected using bodge wires. It turns out that only one digital input on the motor controller supports PWM and I routed the PWM signal to another (unsupported) input.</p>



<p>I also designed a board to mount the battery onto. It‚Äôs much simpler: it has two XT60 connectors and two switches (wired in parallel because of currents up to 18 A) to turn the cube on and off.</p>



<h2>Controller design and tuning</h2>



<p>I didn‚Äôt actually design the controller the cube myself, but ported the <a href="https://github.com/fbobrow/cubli-firmware" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/fbobrow/cubli-firmware">work</a> by Fabio Bobrow from Arm Mbed to Arduino. I‚Äôm also using an ESP32 instead of an STM32 Nucleo. Nevertheless, rewriting the code was a good chunk of work. Also, since I‚Äôm using a different IMU (the ICM20948 by TDK Invensense), I had to rewrite the corresponding ‚Äúdriver‚Äù. I still spent quite some time studying the design of this controller and will spend a few words to highlight some nice things about it.</p>



<p>The design of the main attitude controller is most interesting. It is perhaps best explained as a negotation between two <em>contradictory </em>objectives. The first objective is to keep the cube in its desired orientation, that is, at its unstable equilibrium position. A second goal, however, is to keep the wheel velocities to a minimum. Not considering this second objective could lead to wheels speeds getting out of control, saturing the motors, and thereby effectively rendering it unable to exert torques on the cube.</p>



<p>The two objectives are in conflict: if the ‚Äòdesire‚Äô to keep wheel velocities close to zero is too great, the cube simply falls over. Like mentioned before, if it is too weak, the wheels might literally spin out of control. The trick therefore is to find gains that result in good balancing performance and disturbance rejection while keeping wheel velocities somewhat low.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="575" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tomato-still-1024x575.png" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tomato-still-1024x575.png 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tomato-still-300x168.png 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tomato-still-768x431.png 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tomato-still-1536x863.png 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tomato-still-1568x880.png 1568w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tomato-still.png 1674w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>There is another elegant mechanism in the controller to deal with constant errors. What are constant errors? For example, there might be a small difference between the configured equilibrium position and the actual equilibrium due to imperfections in the weight distributions of the cube. In a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controller, the integral part deals with these kinds of errors. This controller uses the <em>position</em> (in degrees) of the wheel as the integral! In my opinion, this is actually a very intuitive way of visualizing an integral controller. When I modify the weight distribution of the cube (in the video: by placing a tomato on it), you can see the reaction wheels increase and then decrease in speed: they are moving to a new <em>position </em>to compensate for the increased error!</p>



<p>Commissioning and tuning the controller was, by far, the largest piece of code-related work. Like any experienced controls engineer, I spent a few days flipping the signs of various signals before I got them right. Then, I had to find the right gains for the controller. The tuning methodology as described in Bobrow‚Äôs <a href="https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/3/3139/tde-20102022-084937/publico/FabioBobrowCorr22.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/3/3139/tde-20102022-084937/publico/FabioBobrowCorr22.pdf">dissertation</a> didn‚Äôt work for me, so I resorted to tuning the gains by hand. Note that my cube uses different wheels compared to Bobrow‚Äôs cube, so reusing the gains was not possible. Using an iterative procedure, I finally obtained the gains that result in the stabilizing performance as shown in the video (which is very good, in my humble opinion).</p>

<p>That‚Äôs it! A balancing cube. It‚Äôs the only fully open-source cube in the world which achieves a balancing performance similar to that of Cubli, as far as I know. I hope that others will now also be inspired to build this cool device.</p>



<p>Here are some links to similar cubes which are at least somewhat documented (more than just a video or photo):</p>

</ul>



<h2>Next steps: jumping up</h2>



<p>I plan to add mechanical brakes to the reaction wheels. These will enable the wheels to be braked rapidly, resulting in much larger torques than the motors can deliver. This enables jump-up manoeuvers which in turn enable the cube to get to its equilibrium position on its own. This feature is currently unique to the original Cubli, as far as I know. I don‚Äôt particularly like the braking mechanism that Cubli uses for various reasons, so I‚Äôm going to use a different approach. I‚Äôll share results in a future post!</p>

<p><em><strong>Joan Costa-i-Font, Professor of Health Economics at London School Of Economics And Political Science, Sarah Fleche, Researcher, Centre for Economic Performance at London School Of Economics And Political Science, and Ricardo Pagan, Professor of Economics at University Of Malaga. <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/sleeping-our-way-being-productive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Originally published at VoxEU</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Sleep is key to our physical and mental health. It also affects people‚Äôs employment and productivity. This column explores how the amount of weekly sleep influences employment, productivity, and the income of individuals in Germany. Each additional hour of sleep per week increases the probability of employment by 1.6 percentage points and weekly earnings by 3.4%. Sleep is partly the product of both public and private decisions, and can be incentivised so that the negative economic effects of not sleeping enough are more salient to individuals.</em></p>
<p>People are not robots; we need sleep to recover energy. Sleeping is the activity that people spend most time on in a normal week. Lack of sleep contributes to the desynchronisation of circadian rhythms and weakens the immune system and cognitive activity in addition to physical and mental health (Nagai et al. 2010). Lack of sleep is associated with unhealthy behaviours related to a modern lifestyle, the presence of psychosocial stress, an unbalanced diet, and limited physical activity.</p>
<p>Although sleeping enough is essential for optimal physical and psychological wellbeing, we do not always get enough sleep to feel rested. An individual‚Äôs quality of sleep is not completely under an individual‚Äôs control. It is a reflection of our worries and experiences in our professional and personal lives, including exposure to digital temptations, commuting time, financial worries, and work stress; sugary diets and mental health can also influence sleep.</p>
<p>Lack of sleep is so widespread that when people are asked what they would do with an unexpected weekly time windfall, the most common response is to sleep more (National Sleep Foundation 2020). Luckily, sleep patterns differ between weekdays and weekends, as unstructured time allows us to meet our sleep needs. Some of us sleep more on weekends, while others take daytime naps to compensate for this chronic lack of sleep. All of this explains the increase in sleep time dispersion over recent decades in the US (Hamermesh and Pfann 2022).</p>
<p>However, sleep is not factored in classic textbook microeconomic models, which typically refer to the trade-off between allocating time to leisure or work. Sleeping time is assumed to be constant. But today, we know that sleep is important as another time constraint in making time allocations, and it exerts effects on our physical and mental health.</p>
<p><strong>Social and Economic Drivers of Sleep</strong></p>
<p>Sleep quality is affected by changes in exposure to light, noise or the use of communication technologies (mobile devices), and access to the Internet or television. For example, the intensity of light in homes has an environmental influence on sleep quality, since natural melatonin is influenced by light exposure. Likewise, the time spent using technologies can compete with the time individuals would spend sleeping without them, and ‚Äòdigital temptations‚Äô not only reduce sleep time but increase exposure to blue light technologies just before going to sleep (Billari 2018). Finally, those of us who are parents will have experienced first-hand how the quality of sleep deteriorates when there are children in the home.</p>
<p>Any economist who has read Gary Becker‚Äôs theory of time allocation would surely point out the opportunity cost of sleep, that is, the utility loss in terms of leisure and work derived from allocating time to other activities. Higher pay and responsibility, or an intense night-time social life, can take their toll in terms of lack of sleep. For example, a classic estimate suggests that a 1-hour increase in work time is associated with a 13-minute reduction in sleep (Biddle and Hamermesh 1990).</p>
<p>Of course, the cost of sleep can vary over people‚Äôs life cycles and even across seasons and time zones. What we do know is that this opportunity cost of sleep is exogenously influenced by the economic cycle, and some studies estimate that sleep duration is countercyclical: you sleep better when economic activity slows down, and sleep duration decreases when economic activity recovers (Costa-Font 2022).</p>
<p><strong>Sleep and Productivity</strong></p>
<p>Sleep not only affects wellbeing through the direct utility derived from its consumption but also through the greater income and productivity from feeling rested, which affects work motivation and cognitive functions. One way to study the effect of exogenous changes on sleep is to use changes in time zone variation to sunset times.</p>
<p>One such study using cross-sectional time-use data from the US estimates that a one hour increase in weekly sleep time generates an increase in earnings by 1.1% in the short run and 5% in the long run (Gibson and Shrader 2018). These results are economically relevant: they suggest that an extra hour of sleep per week raises earnings by roughly half as much as an additional year of formal education. But the study does not account for the fact that sleep is different for each person. Accounting for individual differences would require data that accounts for individual fixed effects. Further, estimates might be different in European labour markets, which operate differently due to the greater presence of union negotiations and where hourly pay is less common.</p>
<p>In our study (Costa-Font et al. 2024), we draw on panel data from Germany to estimate ‚Äì analogously to the American study ‚Äì how the amount of weekly sleep influences employment, productivity, and income of individuals. As displayed in Figure 1, we exploit as a natural experiment evidence that suggests that, on average, one hour of sun exposure reduces sleep hours by between 5 and 7 minutes, depending on where an individual lives in Germany (Costa-Font et al. 2024). We estimate that each additional hour of sleep per week increases the probability of employment by 1.6 percentage points and weekly earnings by 3.4%.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> Sleep and light exposure</p>

<p>These estimates are also comparable to those of another work with British data (Costa-Font and Fleche 2017), where we used the variations in child sleep interruptions over time as an instrument for changes in mothers‚Äô (and fathers‚Äô) sleep duration, to estimate the effect of sleep on the economic performance of mothers (Costa-Font and Fleche 2020). We documented that increasing the average duration of a mother‚Äôs night‚Äôs sleep by half an hour increases her participation in the labour market by 2.5 percentage points, her working hours by 8.3%, and her family income by 3.1%, although their job satisfaction only increases very slightly. We observe that these effects depend on the influence of maternal sleep on selection into full-time versus part-time work. However, we found that increased work schedule flexibility among more experienced mothers partially mitigates the negative effects of sleep deprivation.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Effects and Incentives to Sleep</strong></p>
<p>Some research has quantified the overall effects of sleep on the economy. The monetary costs of sleep deprivation on the economy are estimated at 1.9‚Äì2.9% of GDP in the US, 1.4‚Äì1.8% in the UK, 1.0‚Äì1.6% in Germany, and 0.8‚Äì1.6% in Canada (Hafner et al. 2017).</p>
<p>Given the effect that sleep has on work outcomes and health, some organisations have considered designing incentives for sleep. For example, Aetna, a private health insurance company, offers $25 for every 20 nights that people sleep 7 hours or more, with a limit of $500 a year, which is monitored by electrical devices (Hallett 2016). This effect adds to other evidence suggesting that subsidising digital information devices to track sleep can incentivise the time allocated to sleep. In fact, evidence from a randomised control trial suggests that a subsidy to employees to purchase a wearable bracelet significantly improves sleep and exercise (Handel and Kolstad 2017).</p>
<p>However, one possible criticism of traditional economic approaches to sleep is that it is unclear to what extent individuals are aware of its effects on their economic activity, which limits the role of traditional economic incentives. This seems a fertile field to test behavioural incentives, since many of the decisions about sleep are automatic, forged by routines and not by conscious decisions, which opens the possibility of making multiple adjustments in the sleep decision-making architecture.</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Policy Implications?</strong></p>
<p>Public interventions can make these economic effects of lack of sleep more salient to individuals. For example, it is possible to redesign television programme schedules or work hours, as well as regulate work expectations about answering emails and access to screens at night in general. Another issue that we could revisit via policy interventions is the so-called ‚Äòcultural or social reference points‚Äô.</p>
<p>Lack of sleep generates what we call internalities in behavioural economics. That is, it entails negative consequences on our future wellbeing (future selves). Since people are subject to ‚Äòpresent bias‚Äô, we fall to the temptation of delaying bedtime for the immediate gains of watching our favourite television series or having interesting conversations, ignoring tomorrow‚Äôs losses in productivity and motivation. These behavioural biases point to the need for behavioural interventions (‚Äònudges‚Äô), as simple as an alarm when it‚Äôs time to go to sleep.</p>

<p><strong><abbr title="Too long; didn't read.">TL;DR</abbr></strong> I always hesitated to deploy an extra tool for user management and <abbr title="Single Sign-On">SSO</abbr>, but the current state of the web makes it very difficult to keep up with security, CVEs etc. Why not trust one of the longest standing solutions for identity and access management? Keycloak is open source, interoperable with major SSO protocols (<code>OpenID Connect (OIDC), OAuth 2.0, SAML</code>), and robust. The setup with docker compose is not complicated, but it was not straight forward either. This is why I provide a summary of the process below. </p>
<div>
<p>Info</p>
<p>This is currently a stub. I thought I would share my <code>docker-compose.yml</code> and <code>nginx.conf</code> quickly and update the post later to add steps for theming and integration.</p>

<h2 id="concept">Concept<a href="#concept" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>You may have seen the concept below already in my <a href="https://du.nkel.dev/blog/2023-12-12_mastodon-docker-rootless/">previous post</a> about Mastodon. We will use a standard setup of nginx as a central reverse proxy that forwards traffic through localhost to individual services, all running in their own rootless docker namespaces. I consider this the typical economical setup, by sharing resources of a single host but with maximally isolated environments. Adapt where this does not fit your usecase.</p>

<p>You will need some basic tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH</li>
<li>A <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr> with Linux (Ubuntu; Debian etc.)</li>
<li>A domain or subdomain where you can add an <code>A</code> (and optionally <code>AAAA</code>) record for your service</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the <a href="https://du.nkel.dev/blog/2023-12-12_mastodon-docker-rootless/#docker-rootless-setup">Mastodon post</a> for basic setup of docker rootless to:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a new non-root user named <code>keycloak</code>, without password, with its home directory set to <code>/srv/keycloak</code></li>
<li>update <code>/etc/subuid</code> and <code>/etc/subgid</code> ranges with user <code>keycloak</code> (because e.g. the postgres container will need these to create a nested non-root user itself)</li>
<li>install docker rootless through <code>dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh</code> and configure automatic service start for the <code>keycloak</code> user</li>
</ul>

<p>The official docs provide some information here <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. But they use <code>docker run</code>, which would be unusual in production.</p>
<p>Going to a compose file is not complicated and allows us to have a more reproducable setup. There are some example <code>docker-compose.yml</code>s available, such as <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> or <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We will start with a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> that directly uses <a href="https://quay.io/repository/keycloak/keycloak?tab=tags&amp;tag=latest">the official keycloak image</a>. This can be changed later.</p>

<details>
<summary>Some explanations for the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> above</summary>
<ul>
<li><code>'127.0.0.1:8080:8080'</code> and <code>KC_PROXY: edge</code> will make keycloak listen on localhost</li>
<li>the syntax for env variables (<code>${KC_HOSTNAME:-your.tld.com}</code>) means:<br>
  1. use <code>KC_HOSTNAME</code> from <code>.env</code>, if available;<br>
  2. otherwise substitute a default value (<code>your.tld.com</code>)  </li>
<li>note (e.g.) that we do not set <code>KC_DB_USERNAME</code>, which means: <em>use the default</em>  </li>
<li><code>image: quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:23.0.6</code> references a specific  image tag, as is     suggested for production (only use <code>:latest</code> for development).</li>
<li><code>KC_LOG_LEVEL: debug</code> can be commented out once we are done with development</li>
<li>bind-mount the persistent postgres data from the subfolder created earlier in the     user's home directory:
  <div><pre><span></span><code>services:
<span>  </span>postgres_db:
<span>    </span>image:<span> </span>postgres:16
<span>    </span>volumes:
<span>      </span>-<span> </span>/srv/keycloak/data/postgres16:/var/lib/postgresql/data
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>if you want to start over from scratch, simply delete this postgres folder and it     will be re-initialized on next startup:
  <div><pre><span></span><code>CTRL+D
sudo<span> </span>rm<span> </span>-rf<span> </span>/srv/keycloak/data/postgres16
sudo<span> </span>machinectl<span> </span>shell<span> </span>keycloak@
<span>cd</span><span> </span>~<span> </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> </span>mkdir<span> </span>-p<span> </span>data/postgres16
</code></pre></div></li>
<li><code>/srv/keycloak/data/postgres16</code> holds the persistent data that would need periodic     backups</li>
</ul>
</details>
<h2 id="test-locally">Test locally<a href="#test-locally" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>At this stage, we can test the docker compose stack:
</p><div><pre><span></span><code>docker<span> </span>compose<span> </span>up<span> </span>-d<span> </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> </span>docker<span> </span>compose<span> </span>logs<span> </span>--follow
</code></pre></div>
<p>Afterwards, create a reverse SSH tunnel to your VM and the keycloak local port.
</p><div><pre><span></span><code>ssh<span> </span>you@111.11.11.11<span> </span>-L<span> </span>:8080:127.0.0.1:8080<span> </span>-p<span> </span><span>22</span><span> </span>-N<span> </span>-v
</code></pre></div>
<p>Open <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code> in your browser and you should be greeted with the keycloak welcome screen:
<img alt="keycloak_local" src="https://du.nkel.dev/blog/img/keycloak_local.webp"></p>

<p>Create a new nginx <code>.conf</code> for the keycloak service.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>From here on, wherever you see <code>your.tld.com</code>: replace with your actual domain.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>At this stage, you should head to your domain registrar and add an <code>A</code> record to forward DNS queries to your VM's IP.</p>

<p>So far, we are using the prebuild image from quay.io.</p>
<p>For any customization, e.g. in order to use themes and run the keycloak container in <code>--optimized</code> mode <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup>, we need to build our own image.</p>
<p>We will utilize a multi-stage docker build <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> starting with the official quay.io image.</p>

<p>We are now running a keycloak service in rootless docker behind our system nginx reverse proxy, which does the SSL termination for us.</p>
<p>For automatic updates of the docker container, see the <a href="https://du.nkel.dev/blog/2023-12-12_mastodon-docker-rootless/#automatic-updates">Mastodon post</a>.</p>
<p>The next step would be logging in to the keycloak services and adding
an email under <code>https://your.tld.com/admin/master/console/#/master/realm-settings/email</code>.</p>
<p>Next comes (e.g.) adding a realm. Then theming, which can be done with keycloakify <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>You can see that I already added the necessary lines to the Dockerfile:
</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span># COPY --from=keycloakify_jar_builder /opt/app/build_keycloak/target/ keycloakify-starter-keycloak-theme-5.1.3.jar /opt/keycloak/providers/</span>

I joined GitLab in October 2015, and left in December 2021 after working there
for a little more than six years.</p><p>While I previously wrote <a href="https://yorickpeterse.com/articles/im-leaving-gitlab-to-work-on-inko-full-time/">about leaving
GitLab</a> to work on
<a href="https://inko-lang.org/">Inko</a>, I never discussed what it was like working for
GitLab between 2015 and 2021. There are two reasons for this:</p><ol><li>I was suffering from burnout, and didn't have the energy to revisit the last
six years of my life (at that time)</li><li>I was still under an NDA for another 24 months, and I wasn't sure how much I
could discuss without violating it, even though it probably wouldn't have
caused any problems</li></ol><p>The NDA expired last December, and while I suspect I'm still dealing with the
fallout of a burnout, I have a bit more energy to revisit my time at GitLab.</p><p>I'll structure this article into two main sections: an overview of my time at
GitLab based on what I can still remember, and a collection of things I've
learned as a result of my work and experiences.</p><h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#before-gitlab">Before GitLab</a></li><li><a href="#2015-2017">2015-2017</a></li><li><a href="#2017-2018">2017-2018</a></li><li><a href="#2019-2021">2019-2021</a></li><li><a href="#what-ive-learned">What I've learned</a><ul><li><a href="#scalability-needs-to-be-part-of-a-companys-culture">Scalability needs to be part of a company's culture</a></li><li><a href="#make-teams-more-data-and-developer-driven">Make teams more data and developer driven</a></li><li><a href="#you-cant-determine-what-is-minimal-viable-without-data">You can't determine what is "minimal viable" without data</a></li><li><a href="#a-saas-and-self-hosting-dont-go-well-together">A SaaS and self-hosting don't go well together</a></li><li><a href="#more-people-doesnt-equal-better-results">More people doesn't equal better results</a></li><li><a href="#im-conflicted-on-the-use-of-ruby-on-rails">I'm conflicted on the use of Ruby on Rails</a></li><li><a href="#the-time-it-takes-to-deploy-code-is-vital-to-the-success-of-an-organization">The time it takes to deploy code is vital to the success of an organization</a></li><li><a href="#location-based-salaries-are-discriminatory">Location based salaries are discriminatory</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li></ul><h2 id="before-gitlab">Before GitLab</h2><p>Before joining GitLab, I was working for a small startup based in Amsterdam.
Like most startups, in the months leading up to my departure the company started
to run out of money and had to resort to some desperate solutions, such as
renting out part of the office space to cover the costs. At the same time, I
felt I had done all the things I wanted to and could do at a technical level.</p><p>In parallel to this, I was also working on
<a href="https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius">Rubinius</a> in my spare time, and we had
considered using it on various occasions, going as far as making sure all our
code ran on it without any problems. This also lead to the creation of
<a href="https://github.com/yorickpeterse/oga">Oga</a>, an XML/HTML parsing library acting
as an alternative to Nokogiri.</p><p>Unfortunately, the lack of funding combined with various technical problems
meant that we never pursued the use of Rubinius further. Because of all these
factors, I started looking for a job where I could spend at least some more time
working on Rubinius in hopes of making it stable enough for people to use in a
production environment.</p><p>During this time I attended various Ruby meetups in Amsterdam, and helped out
with a few <a href="https://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a> workshops. At one of these
workshops I ran into <a href="https://sytse.com/">Sytse</a> and his wife, and once again at
a later workshop or meetup (I think, I can't quite remember as it's been a long
time). Through this I learned about GitLab, and developed an interest in working
there.</p><p>Some time in the summer of 2015 I sent Sytse an Email, stating I wanted to work
for GitLab and asking if they were willing to sponsor me working on Rubinius one
day per week. The conversation and interviews that followed resulted in me
starting at GitLab in October 2015 as employee #28. My task was to improve
performance of GitLab, and allowed me to spend 20% of my time on Rubinius.</p><p>During my time I was a part of various teams, had a lot of autonomy, reported to
10 different managers over the years, nearly wiped the company out of existence,
built various critical components that GitLab still uses to this day, saw the
company grow from 30-something employees to around 2000 employees, and ended up
with a burnout. Or as the Dutch saying goes: "Lekker gewerkt, pik!" (good luck
translating that).</p><h2 id="2015-2017">2015-2017</h2><p>My last day at the company before GitLab was September 30, a Wednesday, followed
by starting at GitLab the next day. This meant I went from working in an office
five days per week to working remote five days per week. While I had worked from
home before, mainly when the trains weren't running due to a tiny amount of snow
or leaves on the tracks, it took a bit of adjusting to the new setup.</p><p>A particular memory from this time that stands out is carrying a bag of
groceries home during the day, and realizing how nice it's to do that during the
day instead of in the evening after coming home from work.</p><p>Another memory is taking a nap on my sofa with my cat, of which I took this
picture at the time:</p><p><img src="https://yorickpeterse.com/images/what-it-was-like-working-for-gitlab/sofa_cat.jpg?hash=ef15409a921d80eea3e9e7f853b1dafb410a0c14a003a1b1947aa7226453b5e1" alt="My cat judging me while I try to take a nap"></p><p>Yes, those are Homer Simpson slippers.</p><p>The apartment I was renting at the time wasn't large and only had a small
kitchen area, a small living room, and a similarly small attic. This meant that
my living room functioned as my bedroom, living room, and office all at once. It
wasn't a great setup, but it was all I could afford at the time. Perhaps the
expensive Aeron chair had something to do with it.</p><p>In spite of being an all remote company, GitLab was a social company, with
frequent meetups and events taking place over the years. For example, a few
weeks after I joined there was a company gathering in Amsterdam, involving
various activities during the day and dinners in the evening:</p><p><img src="https://yorickpeterse.com/images/what-it-was-like-working-for-gitlab/amsterdam_dinner.jpg?hash=69193a4e4fe87cea08b63f3712f42e53199b7cd2c894637b060abf312480a8f6" alt="A dinner with everybody at GitLab"></p><p>Back then you could still fit the entire company in one corner of a restaurant.</p><p>Not long after, GitLab had its first growth spurt, resulting in somewhere around
100 new employees (I think? My memories are a bit fuzzy at this point). At the
next company gathering in Austin in 2016, a single corner in a restaurant was no
longer enough:</p><p><img src="https://yorickpeterse.com/images/what-it-was-like-working-for-gitlab/austin_gathering.jpg?hash=5f2b4c1565a5b2ba96e1dbb174f96676b88a23d72d097a5eeef439eed79aed18" alt="The company gathering in Austin, Texas"></p><p>During this time there were also plenty of negative experiences. GitLab suffered
from terrible performance, frequent outages (almost every week some), poor
management, and many other problems that startups face. This lead to "GitLab is
slow" being the number one complaint voice by users. Especially on Hacker News
people just <em>loved</em> to complain about it, no matter what the original topic
(e.g. some new feature announcement) might've been. Of course GitLab was aware
of this, and in fact one of the reasons GitLab hired me was to resolve these
problems.</p><p>Resolving these problems proved a real challenge, in particular because GitLab
had no adequate performance monitoring infrastructure. That's not an
exaggeration by the way: the only service running at the time was a New Relic
trial account that only allowed monitoring of one, <em>maybe</em> two servers out of
the (I think) total of 15-20 servers we had at the time. This meant that
whatever data did come in wasn't an accurate representation, and made measuring
and solving performance a challenge.</p><p>What made solving these problems extra  difficult was GitLab's requirement that
whatever tooling we'd use had to be available to self-hosted customers, and
preferably be open source (or perhaps this was even a hard requirement, I can't
remember). This meant I had to not only improve performance, but also build the
tools to improve performance in the first place. At the same time, writing
performant code (or code that at least isn't horribly slow) wasn't at all
considered a priority for the rest of the company. GitLab also had a tendency to
listen more to complaints on Hacker News than internal complaints. This lead to
an internal running joke that it if you wanted something to change, you'd have
better luck complaining about it anonymously on Hacker News instead of bringing
it up through the proper channels.</p><p>What followed was several months of me trying to improve performance, build the
tooling necessary for this, try to change the company culture/attitude towards
performance such that things would actually improve over time, and deal with
GitLab not being happy with the improvements made. I distinctively remember
there being at least several video calls in which I was close to yelling at
Sytse, though it fortunately never came to that.</p><p>In spite of these challenges I did manage to build the necessary tooling, and
improve performance in various parts (some of which were significant, others not
so much). This tooling became an official GitLab feature known as <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/performance/">"GitLab
Performance Monitoring"</a>,
though it has changed quite a bit over the years. Another tool I built was
<a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/1749">"Sherlock"</a>, a
heavy-weight profiler meant to be used in a development environment.</p><p>During this time, GitLab started to realize you can't solve these sort of
problems by just hiring one person, especially if performance isn't a priority
for the rest of the company. One of the changes this lead to was that instead of
reporting directly to Sytse, I would report to a dedicated manager as part of
the new "Performance" team, and the team had a budget to hire more people. I
don't remember exactly what the budget was, but it wasn't much: two, <em>maybe</em>
three people I think. This wasn't nearly enough given the total size of the
company and it's primary focus being producing as many features as possible, but
it was a start.</p><p>Much of my second year I spent as part of this team, now with a bit more room to
breathe. I continued campaigning for more resources and making good performance
a requirement for new code, but with mixed results, and of course I and the team
as a whole continued improving performance.</p><p>During this time GitLab also saw its first wave of lay-offs and people leaving
by their own will, mainly as a result of GitLab hiring the wrong people in the
first place. This meant that GitLab grew from 30-something to (I think)
130-something people, only to shrink back to 80-something people, only to start
growing again in the months to come.</p><p>As for Rubinius: while we tried to get GitLab to work on Rubinius, we never
succeeded. Combined with the maintainer of Rubinius wanting to take the project
in a different direction and the controversies this lead to within the Ruby
community, we ultimately decided to give up on Rubinius, and I stopped working
on it entirely. It's unfortunate, as Rubinius had a lot going for it over the
years but was ultimately held back by the maintainers running the project in a
way different from what was necessary for it to become successful.</p><h2 id="2017-2018">2017-2018</h2><p><img src="https://yorickpeterse.com/images/what-it-was-like-working-for-gitlab/sytse_giraffe.jpg?hash=06741c66e9a3d93163aa8ab8e653c9a89e85549f13d0e8150b947577f560d74a" alt="South Africa summit in 2018"></p><p>After the first rocky 1,5 years, things started to improve. Performance had
improved greatly, and GitLab was starting to take it more seriously. Hiring
processes were much improved, and like a game of chess GitLab started moving the
right people into the right places. The scope of the performance team also
changed: instead of focusing on performance in general, the team would focus on
database performance and as part of this was to be renamed to the creatively
called "Database team". With this change also came a bigger budget for hiring
people, and infrastructure engineers assigned to help us out with e.g. setting
up new databases.</p><p>A critically important feature I built during this time is <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/postgresql/database_load_balancing.html">GitLab's database
load balancer</a>
(<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/10/02/scaling-the-gitlab-database/">announced here</a>).
This feature allowed developers to continue to write their database queries as
usual, while the load balancer would take care of not directing these queries to
either a replica or a primary. After performing a write, the load balancer
ensures the primary database is used until the written changes are available to
all replicas, an act commonly referred to as "sticking". The introduction of the
load balancer had a significant and positive impact on performance, and I'm
certain GitLab would've been in a lot of trouble if it wasn't for this load
balancer. What I'm most proud of is being able to introduce this system
transparently. To date I've not seen a database load balancer (let alone for
Ruby on Rails) that you can just add to your project and you're good to go.
Instead, existing solutions are more like frameworks that only provide a small
piece of the puzzle, requiring you to glue everything together yourself, often
without any form of sticking support. It's a shame we never got to extract it to
a standalone library.</p><p>This period wasn't just one of incredible productivity and improvements, it also
marked the lowest and scariest moment of my time at GitLab and my career as a
whole: on January 31st, after a long and stressful day of dealing with many
issues that continued well into the late evening, I <del>solved GitLab's performance
problems</del> <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/02/01/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/">removed GitLab's production database by
accident</a>.
This then lead to the discovery that we didn't have any backups as a result of
the system not working for a long time, as well as the system meant to notify us
of any backup errors not working either. In the end we did recover, as I had
copied the production data to our staging environment about six hours prior as
part of of the work I was doing that day, though the recovery process took
around 24 hours. While about six hours of data loss is by all accounts terrible,
I'm not sure what would've happened if I hadn't made that backup. Suffice to
say, my heart skipped a few beats that day, and I'm certain I instantly grew a
few extra grey hairs.</p><p>A recurring source of frustration during this time was GitLab's desire to shard
the database, even after the introduction of the database load balancer. Not
only did I and the other engineers and my manager believe this to be the wrong
solution to our problems, we also had the data to back this up. For example,
sharding is useful if writes heavily outnumber reads, but in case of GitLab
reads dominated writes by a ratio along the lines of 10:1. Further, the amount
of data we were storing wasn't nearly enough to justify the complexity of
introducing sharding. I distinctively remember a consultant we'd hired saying
something along the lines of "No offence, but we have customers with several
orders of magnitudes more load and storage, and even for them sharding is
overkill". In spite of this, GitLab would continue to push for this over the
years, until management made the decision to leave it be, only for GitLab to
bring it up <em>again</em> (just using a slightly different name and idea this time)
towards the end of my time at GitLab.</p><h2 id="2019-2021">2019-2021</h2><p><img src="https://yorickpeterse.com/images/what-it-was-like-working-for-gitlab/new_orleans.jpg?hash=804a9dbb2eba8868a70c4a72029890487cfc847ee7e8bf9f234ec0155f885b71" alt="New Orleans summit in 2019"></p><p>Some time in 2018-2019 I transitioned from the database team into a newly
founded "Delivery" team, as I had grown tired of working on performance and
reliability for the last four years. Furthermore, multiple people were now
working on performance and reliability, so I felt it was the right time
for me to move on to something new. The goal of this new team was to improve the
release process and tooling of GitLab, as the state of this was at the time best
described as messy.</p><p>For example, we looked into how much time there was between a commit landing in
the main branch and deploying the change GitLab.com. The resulting data showed
that on average it would take several days, but in the worst cases it could take
up to <em>three weeks</em>. The main bottleneck here was the split between GitLab
Community Edition and GitLab Enterprise Edition, both existing as separate Git
repositories, requiring manual merges and conflict resolution on a regular
basis. This lead to a multi-month effort to <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/02/21/merging-ce-and-ee-codebases/">merge the two projects into
one</a>.
While we divided the work into frontend and backend work, and made various teams
responsible for contributing their share towards the effort, I ended up
implementing most of the backend related changes, with another colleague taking
care of most of the frontend work.</p><p>Together with the rest of the team we made significant improvements to the
release process during this period, and we reached a point where we could deploy
changes in a matter of hours. While this is nowhere near as quick as it
should've been, going from a worst-case of three weeks to a worst-case of
<em>maybe</em> a day is a <em>massive</em> improvement.</p><p>Like the previous periods, this period was not free of turmoil and changes.</p><p>2018 was the last year we had a GitLab summit focused on employees, with 2019
and following years following a format more like a traditional conference, aimed
more at customers and less at employees. From a financial perspective this was
understandable as organizing a gathering of 2000+ people is incredibly
expensive. From a social perspective it was a loss, as the more corporate
setting of the summits wasn't nearly as fun as the old format. I have fond
memories of <a href="https://youtu.be/39chczWRKws?feature=shared&amp;t=1751">Sytse dancing on stage in response to a team winning a
contest</a>, or Sytse and his
wife giving a fitness class while Sytse is wearing a giraffe costume. These sort
of goofy events wouldn't happen any more in the following years.</p><p>Then there was the issue of laptop management: people would request a company
Mac laptop and were more or less free to use it how they saw fit, or you'd use
your own hardware like me. Over the years GitLab's management started
discussions about using software to be able to remotely manage the laptops. A
recurring problem in these discussions was that the proposed tools were invasive
(e.g. they could be used to record user activity), didn't contain any guarantees
against abuse, and feedback from employees (of which there was <em>a lot</em>) would be
ignored until key employees started applying pressure on management. The plans
would then be shelved, only for the discussion to start all over again months
later.</p><p>What stood out the most was not the proposed changes, but rather the way
management handled the feedback, and how the changes in general gave off a vibe
of solutions in search of problems to justify their existence. It's worth
mentioning that most people involved in these discussions (myself included)
understood the need for some form of laptop management (e.g. against theft), but
felt that the invasive solutions proposed went too far.</p><p>GitLab did settle on a laptop management solution using
<a href="https://nl.sentinelone.com/">SentinelOne</a>. While GitLab made it a requirement
for employees to install this software on hardware used to access GitLab
resources, including your personal hardware (or at least was considering
requiring that), I (using my own desktop computer) somehow managed to stay under
the radar and was never asked to install the software in question. Perhaps
because I wasn't using a company issued laptop, GitLab just forgot to check up
on me.</p><p>These cultural changes combined with various changes in my personal life
resulted in a loss of motivation, productivity, and an increase in stress, and
less consistent working hours. The team's manager (whom I'd consider the best
manager I've ever had) also transitioned to a different role, with a newly hired
manager now leading the team. I didn't get along well with this manager,The
resulting conflict lead to a "performance enablement plan", a procedure meant to
get things back on track before the need for a "performance improvement plan"
(PIP). A PIP is meant to be used as a last attempt at improving the relationship
between an employee, their work, and their employer.</p><p>What rubbed me the wrong way was how GitLab handled the PEP: I acknowledged
there were areas I needed to improve upon, but I felt that part of the problem
was the new manager's way of working. Management assured me that the PEP meant
to improve the state of things on both ends, i.e. it wouldn't just focus on <em>me</em>
improving but also the manager. That didn't happen, and the PEP focused solely
on what <em>I</em> needed to do differently. The PEP was also a bit vague about what
requirements had to be met. The original plan was for the PEP to last one month,
but by the end of the first month my manager decided to extend the PEP by
another month because they felt this to be necessary, the reasons for which
weren't well specified. I decided to just go along with it, and after two months
passed I completed the PEP and management deemed the results satisfactory.</p><p>The optimist in me likes to believe I was just the first employee to be put on a
PEP and thus management had to figure things out as we went along. The pessimist
in me has a far more negative opinion on this series of events, but I'll keep
that to myself.</p><p>After this experience I realized that perhaps it was time for me to leave, as
both GitLab and I were heading in different directions, and I was unhappy with
the state of things at the time.</p><p>The opportunity for this presented itself towards the end of 2021: GitLab was
going public, and taking into account the time I had to wait before I could
exercise my stock options meant I'd be able to leave in December 2021. I
couldn't leave earlier due to how stock option taxes worked in The Netherlands
at the time: exercising stock options meant having to pay full income taxes
(52%) over the difference between the exercise fee and valuation, even if the
stock isn't liquid. In my case the amount of taxes would be so high I wouldn't
be able to afford it, forcing me to wait until GitLab went public. A few months
later the law changed, and you can now choose to pay the taxes either at the
time of exercise, or when the stock is liquid. The caveat is that if you defer
taxes until the stock is liquid, you pay taxes based on the value at that time,
not based on the value at the time of exercising your stock options. This
certainly isn't ideal and presents a huge financial risk, but at least you have
a choice.</p><p>And so with my stocks acquired, I left in December 2021 to work on
<a href="https://inko-lang.org/">Inko</a> full-time, using my savings to cover my bills.</p><h2 id="what-ive-learned">What I've learned</h2><p>With the history out of the way, let's take a look at some things I've learned
from my time at GitLab. One thing to keep in mind is that I'm basing these
findings on my personal experiences, and as such it's not unlikely I'm wrong in
some areas.</p><h3 id="scalability-needs-to-be-part-of-a-companys-culture">Scalability needs to be part of a company's culture</h3><p>A mistake GitLab made, and continued to make when I left, was not caring enough
about scalability. Yes, directors would say it was important and improvements
were certainly made, but it was never as much of a priority as other goals. At
the heart of this problem lies the way GitLab makes money: it primarily earns
money from customers self-hosting GitLab Enterprise Edition, not GitLab.com. In
fact, GitLab.com always cost <em>much</em> more money than it brought in. This
naturally results in a focus on the self-hosted market, and many of the
performance problems we ran into on GitLab.com didn't apply to many self-hosted
customers.</p><p>What was even more frustrating was that many developers in fact <em>wanted</em> to
improve performance, but weren't given the time and resources to do so.</p><h3 id="make-teams-more-data-and-developer-driven">Make teams more data and developer driven</h3><p>Another factor is GitLab's product manager driven nature. While some key
developers may have had the ability to influence product decisions (given enough
screaming and kicking), it was mainly product managers and directors deciding
what needed to be implemented. Sometimes these decisions made a lot of sense,
other times they seemed to be based solely on the equivalent of "I read on
Hacker News this is a good idea, so we have to build it".</p><p>I believe GitLab would've been able to perform better as a company if it adopted
a simpler hierarchy early on, instead of the traditional multi-layer hierarchy
it has today. In particular, I think the idea of product managers needs to go in
favour of giving team leads more power and having them interact more with users.
To me, that's ultimately what a "product manager" should do: help build the
product at a technical level, but also act as a liaison between the team and its
users.</p><h3 id="you-cant-determine-what-is-minimal-viable-without-data">You can't determine what is "minimal viable" without data</h3><p>One of GitLab's core principles is to always start with a "minimal viable
change". The idea is to deliver the smallest possible unit of work that delivers
value to the user. On paper that sounds great, but in practice the definition of
"minimal" is inconsistent between people. The result is that one team might
consider performance or good usability a requirement to something being viable,
while another team couldn't care less.</p><p>In practice this lead to GitLab building many features over the years that just
weren't useful: a serverless platform nobody asked for and that was ultimately
killed off, support for managing Kubernetes clusters that didn't work for three
weeks without anybody noticing, a chatops solution we had to build on top of our
CI offering (thus introducing significant latency) instead of using existing
solutions, or a requirements management feature that only supported creating and
viewing data (not even updating or deleting); these are just a few examples from
recent years.</p><p>To determine what makes something viable, you need a deep understanding of the
desires of your target audience. While GitLab does perform <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/performance-indicators/paid-nps/">user surveys every
quarter</a>,
and some teams have access to data about user engagement, from what I remember
and learned from talking to other former colleagues it seems this data was more
incidentally used, instead of being a core part of each team's workflow.</p><h3 id="a-saas-and-self-hosting-dont-go-well-together">A SaaS and self-hosting don't go well together</h3><p>GitLab offers two types of product: self-hosted installations and a software as
a service (SaaS) offering. I believe most companies won't be able to effectively
offer such a setup, including GitLab. Not only do you get a conflict of interest
based on what earns you the most money (as mentioned above), but the two types
of setups also come with different requirements and ways of applying updates.</p><p>For example, for a SaaS you want to be able to deploy quickly and have to
handle large amounts of data and workloads taking place on a centralized
infrastructure. Given most self-hosted instances tend  to be tiny in comparison
to the SaaS offering, many of the solutions for the problems you encounter as a
SaaS and their corresponding solutions just don't apply to self-hosted
installations. This effectively results in two code paths in many parts of your
platform: one for the SaaS version, and one for the self-hosted version. Even if
the code is physically the same (i.e. you provide some sort of easy to use
wrapper for self-hosted installations), you still need to think about the
differences.</p><p>In contrast, when you focus on <em>either</em> a SaaS or self-hosted setup you get to
dedicate all your attention to providing the best experience for the setup in
question. There are of course exceptions, but they are exactly that: exceptions,
and exceptions are rare.</p><h3 id="more-people-doesnt-equal-better-results">More people doesn't equal better results</h3><p>Like many other companies before it, GitLab hired large numbers of people over
the years and today employs over 2000 people. I don't know how many of those are
developers today, but I'm guessing at least a few hundred based on a quick
glance at their team page.</p><p>It's well known that adding more people to a project doesn't necessarily improve
productivity and results (see also "The Mythical Man-Month"), and yet almost
every western startup with venture capital seems to ignores this, hiring
hundreds of developers even if the product doesn't need nearly that many
developers.</p><p>I don't have any data to back this up, but I suspect that most companies don't
need more than 20 developers, with some needing 20 to 50 developers, and only a
handful needing between 50 and 100 developers. Once you cross the 100 developer
mark, I think you need to start thinking about whether the scope of your
product(s) isn't getting out of hand before hiring even more people.</p><p>Note that I'm specifically talking about software developers here. For example,
if you're building custom hardware, you'll probably need more people to scale up
the production process. Sales and support are also two areas where you generally
do benefit from having more people, as these types of work require less
synchronisation between people.</p><h3 id="im-conflicted-on-the-use-of-ruby-on-rails">I'm conflicted on the use of Ruby on Rails</h3><p>GitLab is built using Ruby and Ruby on Rails, and this is a big part of what
allowed it to reach the success it enjoys today. At the same time, this
combination presents its challenges when the project reaches a large size with
many contributors of different experience levels. Rails in particular makes it
too easy to introduce code that doesn't perform well.</p><p>For example, if you want to display a list of projects along with a counter
showing the number of project members, it's far too easy to introduce the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/97197/what-is-the-n1-selects-problem-in-orm-object-relational-mapping">N+1
query problem</a>
by accident. While Rails (or more specifically, ActiveRecord) provides
functionality to solve this, it's an opt-in mechanism, inevitably leading to
developers forgetting about this. Many of the performance problems solved during
my first few years at GitLab were N+1 query problems.</p><p>Other frameworks have learned from this over the years and provide better
alternatives. The usual approach is that instead of being able to arbitrarily
query associated data, you have to pass in the data ahead of time. The benefit
here is that if you were to forget passing the data in, you'd run into some sort
of error rather than the code querying the data for you on a per-row basis,
introducing performance problems along the way.</p><p>Ruby itself is also a choice I have mixed opinions on. On one end, it's an
wonderful language I enjoyed using for a little under 10 years. On the other
end, it's heavy use of meta programming makes it difficult to use in large
projects, even with the introduction of optional typing. I'm not just saying
that for the sake of saying it, I experienced it first hand when writing <a href="https://github.com/yorickpeterse/ruby-lint">a
static analysis tool for Ruby</a> years
ago.</p><p>In spite of all this, I'm not sure what alternative I would recommend instead of
the combination of Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Languages such as Go, Rust or Node.js
might be more efficient than Ruby, but none have a framework as capable as Ruby
on Rails. Python and Django <em>might</em> be an option, but I suspect you'll run into
similar problems as Ruby and Ruby on Rails, at least to some degree. It would
probably help if new web frameworks stopped obsessing over how to define your
routing tree, and instead focused more on productivity as a whole.</p><p>I have some vague ideas on how I'd approach this with
<a href="https://inko-lang.org/">Inko</a>, but there's a lot of other work that needs doing
before I can start writing a web framework in Inko.</p><h3 id="the-time-it-takes-to-deploy-code-is-vital-to-the-success-of-an-organization">The time it takes to deploy code is vital to the success of an organization</h3><p>This is something I already knew before joining GitLab, having spent a
significant amount of time setting up good deployment and testing pipelines at
my previous job, but working for GitLab reinforced this belief: you need to be
able to deploy your code <em>fast</em>, i.e. within at most an hour of pushing the
changes to whatever branch/tag/thing you deploy from. At GitLab it took
somewhere around four years for us to get even close to that, and we still had a
long way to go.</p><p>Apart from the obvious benefits, such as being able to respond to incidents more
efficiently (without having to hot-patch code to account for your deploys taking
hours), there's also a motivational benefit: being able to see your changes live
is <em>nice</em> because you actually get to see and make use of your work. Nothing is
more demotivating than spending weeks on a set of changes, only for it to take
another two weeks for them to be deployed.</p><p>For this to work, you need to be incredibly aggressive about cutting down deploy
times and the time it takes to run your test suite as part of your deployments.
Depending on the type of application and the types of services you're testing,
you may inherently need a certain amount of time to run the tests. The point
here is not "tests and deployments must never take more than X minutes", but
rather to (as an organization) make it a priority to be able to deploy as fast
as your business requirements allow you to. As obvious as this may seem, I
suspect many organizations aren't doing nearly as good of a job in this area as
they could.</p><h3 id="location-based-salaries-are-discriminatory">Location based salaries are discriminatory</h3><p>The salary you earn at GitLab is influenced by various variables, one of which
is location. The influence of your location isn't insignificant either. When you
are a company with a physical office and have a need to hire people in specific
areas, it might make sense to adjust pay based on location as you otherwise
might not be able to hire the necessary people in the required areas. But for an
all remote company without a physical office, and legal entities across the
whole world, there's no legitimate reason to pay two different people with the
same experience and responsibilities different salaries purely based on where
they live.</p><p>To illustrate: when I left GitLab my salary was around ‚Ç¨120 000 per year, or
around ‚Ç¨8500 per month, before taxes. For The Netherlands this is a good salary,
and you'll have a hard time finding companies that offer better <em>and</em> let you
work from home full time. But if I had instead lived in the Bay Area, I would've
earned at least twice that amount, possibly even more. Not because I am somehow
able to do my job better in the Bay Area, or because of any other valid
reason for that matter, but because I would be living in the Bay Area instead of
in The Netherlands.</p><p>No matter how you try to spin this, it's by all accounts an act of
discrimination to pay one person less than another purely based on where they
live. Think about it: if a company pays a person less because of the color of
their skin or their gender, the company would be in big trouble. But somehow
it's OK to pay a person less based on their location?</p><p>As for how to solve this, for companies it's easy: just pay based on the
position's requirements, not the location of the applicant. It doesn't matter
whether you're paying somebody in the Bay Area $100 000 per year, or somebody in
the Philippines, because the cost for you as a business is the same. For
employees my only advice is to try and negotiate a better salary, but this may
prove difficult as companies paying based on locations also tend to be stubborn
about it. I hope one day our laws catch up with this practice.</p><p>A company that seems to do a good job at this is the <a href="https://oxide.computer/">0xide Computer
Company</a>. Instead of paying employees based on their
location, 0xide pays employees the same amount (see <a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values">this
post</a> for
more details), something I deeply admire and believe more companies should do.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Looking back, my time at GitLab is a mix of both incredibly positive and
negative experiences. I'm incredibly proud of the achievements the various teams
I was on made, and the people I got to work with, but I'm also saddened by the
last year or so souring an otherwise great experience. I don't have any regrets
working for GitLab, and would do it all over again if I could, just a little
differently thanks to the benefit of hindsight. I also still recommend it as a
company to work for, because in spite of its flaws I think it does <em>much</em> better
than many other companies.</p></section></div>]]></description>

<p>Last year, a new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623022503">study</a> on green innovations and patents in 27 countries left one reader slack-jawed. The findings were no surprise. What was baffling was how the authors, two professors of economics in Europe, had pulled off the research in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reader, a PhD student in economics, was working with the same data described in the paper. He knew they were riddled with holes ‚Äì sometimes big ones: For several countries, observations for some of the variables the study tracked were completely absent. The authors made no mention of how they dealt with this problem. On the contrary, they wrote they had ‚Äúbalanced panel data,‚Äù which in economic parlance means a dataset with no gaps.</p>



<p>‚ÄúI was dumbstruck for a week,‚Äù said the student, who requested anonymity for fear of harming his career. (His identity is known to Retraction Watch.)</p>



<p>The student wrote a polite email to the paper‚Äôs first author, <a href="https://ju.se/en/personinfo?sign=hesalm&amp;lang=en">Almas Heshmati</a>, a professor of economics at J√∂nk√∂ping University in Sweden, asking how he dealt with the missing data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In email correspondence seen by Retraction Watch and a follow-up Zoom call, Heshmati told the student he had used Excel‚Äôs autofill function to mend the data. He had marked anywhere from two to four observations before or after the missing values and dragged the selected cells down or up, depending on the case. The program then filled in the blanks. If the new numbers turned negative, Heshmati replaced them with the last positive value Excel had spit out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The student was shocked. Replacing missing observations with substitute values ‚Äì an operation known in statistics as imputation ‚Äì is a common but <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030440761500278X?via%3Dihub">controversial</a> technique in economics that allows certain types of analyses to be carried out on incomplete data. Researchers have established methods for the practice; each comes with its own drawbacks that affect how the results are interpreted. As far as the student knew, Excel‚Äôs autofill function was not among these methods, especially not when applied in a haphazard way without clear justification.</p>



<p>But it got worse. Heshmati‚Äôs data, which the student convinced him to share, showed that in several instances where there were no observations to use for the autofill operation, the professor had taken the values from an adjacent country in the spreadsheet. New Zealand‚Äôs data had been copied from the Netherlands, for example, and the United States‚Äô data from the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This way, Heshmati had filled in thousands of empty cells in the dataset ‚Äì well over one in 10 ‚Äì including missing values for the study‚Äôs outcome variables. A table listing descriptive statistics for the study‚Äôs 25 variables referred to ‚Äú783 observations‚Äù of each variable, but did not mention that many of these ‚Äúobservations‚Äù were in fact imputations.</p>



<p>‚ÄúThis fellow, he imputed everything,‚Äù the student said. ‚ÄúHe is a professor, he should know that if you do so much imputation then your data will be entirely fabricated.‚Äù</p>



<p>Other experts echoed the student‚Äôs concerns when told of the Excel operations underlying the paper.</p>



<p>‚ÄúThat sounds rather horrendous,‚Äù said Andrew Harvey, a professor of econometrics at the University of Cambridge, in England. ‚ÄúIf you fill in lots of data points in this way it will invalidate a lot of the statistics and associated tests. There are ways of dealing with these problems correctly but they do require some effort.</p>



<p>‚ÄúInterpolating data is bad practice but lots of people do it and it‚Äôs not dishonest so long as it‚Äôs mentioned,‚Äù Harvey added. ‚ÄúThe other point about copying data from one country to another sounds much worse.‚Äù</p>



<p>S√∏ren Johansen, an econometrician and professor emeritus at the University of Copenhagen, in Denmark, characterized what Heshmati did as ‚Äúcheating.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>



<p>‚ÄúThe reason it‚Äôs cheating isn‚Äôt that he‚Äôs done it, but that he hasn‚Äôt written it down,‚Äù Johansen said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty egregious.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, ‚ÄúGreen innovations and patents in OECD countries,‚Äù was published in the <em>Journal of Cleaner Production</em>, a <a href="https://journalpublishingguide.vu.nl/WebQuery/vubrowser/498">highly ranked</a> title from Elsevier. It has been cited just once, according to Clarivate‚Äôs Web of Science.</p>



<p>Neither the publisher nor the journal‚Äôs editors, whom the student said he alerted to his concerns, have responded to our requests for comment.</p>



<p>Heshmati‚Äôs coauthor, Mike Tsionas, a professor of economics at Lancaster University in the UK, <a href="https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/intranet/news/article/mike-tsionas">died recently</a>. In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ifabs_remembering-professor-mike-tsionas-a-activity-7150834577173872640-iGW4">a eulogy posted on LinkedIn</a> in January, the International Finance and Banking Society hailed Tsionas as ‚Äúa true luminary in the field of econometrics.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Almas-interview-full-Gmail-journalist-inquiry.pdf">a series of emails</a> to Retraction Watch, Heshmati, who, according to the paper, was responsible for data curation, first said Tsionas had been aware of how Heshmati dealt with the missing data.</p>



<p>‚ÄúIf we do not use imputation, such data is almost useless,‚Äù Heshmati said. He added that the description of the data in the paper as ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù referred to ‚Äúthe final data‚Äù ‚Äì that is, the mended dataset.</p>



<p>Referring to the imputation, Heshmati wrote in a subsequent email:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Of course, the procedure must be acknowledged and explained. I have missed to explain the imputation procedure in the data section unintentionally in the writing stage of the paper. I am fully responsible for imputations and missing to acknowledge it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He added that when he was approached by the PhD student:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I offered him a zoom meeting to explain to him the procedure and even gave him the data. If I had other intensions [sic] and did not believe in my imputation approach, I would not share the data with him. If I had to start over again, I would have managed the data in the same way as the alternative would mean dropping several countries and years.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>G<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/04/25/torturing-data-to-predict-bitcoin-prices-a-book-excerpt/">ary Smith</a>, a professor of economics at Pomona College in Claremont, California, said the copying of data between countries was ‚Äúbeyond concerning.‚Äù He reviewed Heshmati‚Äôs spreadsheet for Retraction Watch and found five cases where more than two dozen data points had been copied from one country to another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marco Hafner, a senior economist at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit think tank, said ‚Äúusing the autofill function may not be the best of ideas in the first place as I can imagine it is not directly evident to what conditions missing values have been determined/imputed.‚Äù</p>



<p>Hafner, who is research leader at RAND Europe, added that ‚Äúunder reasonable assumptions and if it‚Äôs really necessary for analytical reasons, one could fill in data gaps for one country with data from another country.‚Äù But, he said, the impact of those assumptions would need to be reported in a sensitivity analysis ‚Äì something Heshmati said he had not done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>‚ÄúAt the bare minimum,‚Äù Hafner said, the paper should have stated the assumptions underlying the imputation and how it was done ‚Äì something that, he added, would have reduced the chances of the work getting published should the reviewers find the methods inappropriate.</p>
