JVCo, in turn, owns Laidley LLC (Landlord). None of this is unusual except for the part where Meta designs, builds, guarantees, operates, funds the overruns, pays the rent, and does not consolidate it.</p><p>This project has nine data centers and two support buildings, with about four million sq. ft. and 2.064 GW capacity. The support buildings will store the reams of documentation needed to convince everyone this structure isn’t what it looks like. The total capital plan of $28.79 billion will be funded as follows:</p><ul><li><p>$27.30 billion of debt raised by Beignet.</p></li><li><p>$2.45 billion of deferred equity commitments from Blue Owl funds.</p></li><li><p>And, in a feat of financial hydration, $1.16 billion of interest generated by the same borrowed money while it sits in laddered Treasuries.</p></li></ul><p>The structure allows the Issuer to borrow money, earn interest on the borrowed money, and then use that interest to satisfy the equity requirement that would normally require… money.</p><p>Nothing is created. Nothing is contributed. It’s a loop. Borrow money, earn interest, and use the interest to claim you provided equity. The kind of circle only finance can call a straight line.</p><p>Together, these flows cover Beignet’s $23.03 billion obligation to JVCo, plus the usual constellation of capitalized interest, reserve accounts, and transaction expenses. In any other context this would raise questions. For us, it raises the credit rating.</p><p>Meta, through Pelican Leap LLC (Tenant), has entered into eleven triple-net leases—one for each building—with an initial four-year term starting in 2029 and four renewal options that could extend the arrangement to twenty years. The leases rely on the assumption that Meta will continue to need exponentially more compute power and that AI demand will not collapse, reverse, plateau, or become structurally inconvenient.</p><p>The notes issued by Beignet are secured by Beignet’s equity interest in JVCo and relevant transaction accounts. They are not secured by the underlying physical assets, which remain at the JVCo and Landlord level. This is described as standard practice, which is true in the same way that using eleven entities to rent buildings to yourself has become standard practice.</p><p>The resulting structure allows Meta to support the project economically while leaving the associated debt somewhere that is technically not on Meta’s balance sheet. The distinction is thin, but apparently wide enough to matter.</p><p>The preliminary A+ rating reflects our view that this is functionally Meta borrowing $27.30 billion for a campus no one else will touch, packaged in legal formality precise enough to satisfy the letter of consolidation rules and absurd enough to insult the spirit.</p><p>Credit risk aligns almost one-for-one with Meta’s own profile because:</p><ul><li><p>Meta is obligated to fund construction cost overruns beyond 105 percent of the fixed budget, excluding force majeure events, which rating agencies historically treat as theoretical inconveniences rather than recurring features of the physical world.</p></li><li><p>Meta guarantees all lease payments and operating obligations, both during the initial four-year term and across any renewal periods it already intends to exercise, an arrangement whose purpose becomes clearer when one remembers why the campus is being built at all.</p></li><li><p>Meta provides an RVG (residual value guarantee) structured to be sufficient, in most modeled cases, to ensure bondholders are repaid even if Meta recommits to the Metaverse or any future initiative born from its ongoing fascination with expensive detours. We did not model what would happen if data center demand collapses and Meta cannot secure a new tenant. This scenario was excluded for methodological convenience.</p></li><li><p>The minimum rent schedule has been calibrated to produce a debt service coverage ratio of approximately 1.12 through 2049. We consider this a sufficient level of stability usually found only in spreadsheets that freeze when real-world data is used.</p></li></ul><p>Taken together, these features tie Beignet’s credit quality to Meta so tightly that you’d have to not be paying attention to miss them. The structure maintains a precarious technical separation that, under current interpretations of accounting guidance, allows Meta to keep roughly $27 billion of assets and debt off its own balance sheet while continuing to provide every meaningful form of economic support.</p><p>This treatment is considered acceptable because the people who decide what is acceptable have accepted it.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://stohl.substack.com/p/exclusive-credit-report-shows-meta?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://stohl.substack.com/p/exclusive-credit-report-shows-meta?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>JVCo qualifies as a variable interest entity because the equity at risk is ceremonial and the real economic exposure sits entirely with the party insisting it does not control the venture. This remains legal due to the enduring belief that balance sheets are healthier when the risky parts are hidden.</p><p>Under U.S. GAAP, consolidation is required if Meta is the primary beneficiary, defined as the party that both:</p><ol><li><p>Directs the activities that most significantly affect the entity’s performance, and</p></li><li><p>Absorbs significant losses or receives significant benefits.</p></li></ol><p>Meta asserts it is not the primary beneficiary.</p><p>To evaluate that assertion, we note the following uncontested facts:</p><ul><li><p>Meta is responsible for designing, overseeing, and operating a 2.064 GW AI campus, an activity that requires technical capabilities Blue Owl does not possess.</p></li><li><p>Meta bears construction cost overruns beyond 105 percent of the fixed budget, as well as specified casualty repair obligations of up to $3.125 billion per event during construction.</p></li><li><p>Meta provides the guarantee for all rent and operating payments under the leases, across the initial term and any renewals.</p></li><li><p>Meta provides the residual value guarantee, ensuring bondholders are repaid if leases are not renewed or are terminated, either through a sale or by paying the guaranteed minimum values directly.</p></li><li><p>Meta contributes funding, directs operations, bears construction risk, guarantees payments, guarantees asset values, determines utilization, controls renewal behavior, and can trigger the sale of the facility.</p></li></ul><p>Based on this, or despite this, Meta concludes it does not control JVCo.</p><p>Our interpretation is fully compliant with U.S. GAAP, which prioritizes the geometry of the legal structure over the inconvenience of economic substance and recognizes control only if the controlling party agrees to be recognized as controlling.</p><p>Meta has not agreed, and the framework, including this agency, respects that choice.</p><p>For rating purposes, we therefore accept Meta’s non-consolidation as an accounting outcome while treating Meta, in all practical respects, as fully responsible for the performance of an entity it does not officially control.</p><p>The lease structure is designed to look like a normal commercial arrangement while functioning as a long-term commitment Meta insists, for accounting reasons, it cannot possibly predict.</p><p>Tenant will pay fixed rent for the first 19 months of operations, based on a 50 percent assumed utilization rate, after which rent scales with actual power consumption. The leases are triple-net. Meta is responsible for everything: operating costs, maintenance, taxes, insurance, utilities. If a pipe breaks, Meta fixes the pipe. If a hurricane relocates a roof, Meta pays to staple the roof back on.</p><p>In practical terms, the only scenario in which Beignet bears operating exposure is a scenario in which Meta stops paying its own bills, at which point the lease structure becomes irrelevant because the same lawyers that structured this deal will have already quietly extricated Meta from liability.</p><p>The contract terms include:</p><ul><li><p>A minimum rent floor engineered to produce a DSCR of 1.12 in a spreadsheet where 1.12 was likely hard-coded and independent of math.</p></li><li><p>A four-year initial term with four four-year renewal options, theoretically creating a 20-year runway Meta pretends not to see.</p></li><li><p>Meta guarantees all tenant payment obligations across the entire potential lease life, including renewals it strategically refuses to acknowledge as inevitable.</p></li><li><p>No performance-based KPIs. Under this structure, the buildings could underperform, overperform, or catch fire. Meta still pays rent.</p></li><li><p>The RVG requires Meta to ensure that, at every potential lease-termination date, the asset is worth at least the guaranteed minimum value. If markets disagree, Meta pays the difference. Because Meta is rated AA-/Stable, we are instructed to assume that it will do so without hesitation, including in scenarios where demand softens or secondary markets discover that a hyperscale campus in Richland Parish is not the world’s most liquid asset class.</p></li></ul><p>The interplay between the lease term and the RVG creates a circular logic we find structurally exquisite.</p><p>From a credit perspective, this circularity is considered supportive, because the same logic used to avoid consolidating the debt also ensures bondholders are paid. The circularity is not treated as a feature or a flaw. It is treated as accounting.</p><p>Because Meta is AA-/Stable, we assume it will pay whatever number the Excel model finds through Goal Seek, even in scenarios involving technological obsolescence or an invasion of raccoons.</p><p>The accounting hinges on a paradox engineered with dull tweezers:</p><ul><li><p>Under lease accounting, Meta must record future lease obligations only if renewals are reasonably certain.</p></li><li><p>Under RVG accounting, Meta must record a guarantee liability only if payment is probable.</p></li></ul><p>To keep $27 billion off its balance sheet, Meta must therefore assert:</p><ul><li><p>Renewals are not reasonably certain, despite designing, funding, building, and exclusively using a 2.064 GW AI campus for which the realistic tenant list begins and ends with Meta.</p></li><li><p>The RVG will probably never be triggered, despite the fact that not renewing would trigger it immediately.</p></li></ul><p>This requires a narrow corridor of assumptions in which Meta simultaneously plans to use the facility for two decades and insists that no one can predict four years of corporate intention.</p><p>From a credit standpoint, we are supportive. The assumptions that render the debt invisible are precisely what make it secure. A harmony best described as collateralized cognitive dissonance.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Meta linkage.</strong><span> The economics are wedded to Meta’s credit profile, which we are required to describe as AA-/Stable rather than “the only reason this entire structure doesn’t fold from a stiff breeze.” Meta guarantees the rent, the RVG, and the continued relevance of the facility. The rest is décor auditors would deem “tasteful.”</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Minimum rent floor.</strong><span> The lease schedule produces a perfectly flat DSCR of 1.12 through 2049. Projects of this size do not produce flat anything, but the model insists otherwise, so we pretend we believe it. Being sticklers for tradition, and having learned nothing from the financial crisis of 2008, we treat the spreadsheet as the final arbiter of truth, even when the inputs describe a world no one lives in.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Construction risk transfer.</strong><span> Meta absorbs cost overruns beyond 105 percent of budget and handles casualty repairs during construction. Our methodology interprets “contractually transferred” as “ceased to exist,” so we decline to model the risk of overruns on a $28 billion campus built in a hurricane corridor. This is considered best practice.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>RVG backstop.</strong><span> The residual value guarantee eliminates tail risk in much the same way a parent cosigning for their teenager’s car loan eliminates tail risk: by ensuring that the person with all the money pays for everything. If the market value collapses, Meta pays the difference. If the facility can’t be sold, Meta pays the whole thing. If the entire campus becomes a raccoon sanctuary, Meta still pays. We classify this as credit protection, a nuanced designation that allows us to recognize the security of the arrangement without recognizing the debt.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Absence of performance KPIs. </strong><span>There are no operational KPIs that allow rent abatement. This is helpful because KPIs create volatility, and volatility requires thought, a variable we explicitly exclude from our methodology. By removing KPIs entirely, the structure ensures a level of cash-flow stability that exists only in transactions where the tenant is also the economic owner pretending to be a squatter.</span></p></li></ul><p>The rating also reflects several risks that are acknowledged, intellectually troubling, and ultimately tolerated because Meta is large enough that everyone agrees to stop asking questions.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Off-balance-sheet dependence. </strong><span>Meta treats JVCo as if it belongs to someone else, which is a generous interpretation of ownership. If consolidation rules ever evolve to reflect economic substance, Meta could be required to add $27 billion of assets and matching debt back onto its own balance sheet. Our methodology treats this as a theoretical inconvenience rather than a credit event, because calling it what it really is would create a conflict with the very companies we rate.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Concentration risk. </strong><span>The entire project exists for one tenant with one business model in one industry undergoing technological whiplash. The facility is engineered so specifically for Meta’s AI ambitions that the only plausible alternative tenant is another version of Meta from a parallel timeline. We strongly disagree with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. We set this concern aside because at this stage in the transaction, the A+ rating is a structural load-bearing wall, and we are not paid to do demolition.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Residual value uncertainty. </strong><span>The RVG depends on modeled guaranteed minimum values that assume buyers will one day desire a vast hyperscale complex in Richland Parish under stress scenarios. If hyperscale supply balloons or the resale market for 2-gigawatt data centers becomes as illiquid as common sense, Meta will owe more money. This increases Meta’s direct obligations, which should concern us, but does not, because Meta is rated AA-/Stable and therefore presumed to withstand any scenario we have chosen not to model.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Casualty and force majeure. </strong><span>In extreme scenarios, multiple buildings could be destroyed by a hurricane, which we view as unlikely given that they almost never impact Louisiana. The logic resembles a Rube Goldberg machine built out of indemnities. We classify this as a strength.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>JV structural subordination. </strong><span>Cash flows must navigate waterfalls, covenants, carve-outs, and the possibility of up to $75 million of JV-level debt. These features introduce structural complexity, which we flag, then promptly ignore, because acknowledging would force us to explain who benefits from the convolution.</span></p></li></ul><p>Despite these risks, we maintain an A+ rating because Meta’s credit quality is strong, the structure is designed to hide risk rather than transfer it, and our role in this ecosystem is to observe these contradictions and proceed as though they were features rather than warnings.</p><p>The outlook is Superficially Stable. That means we expect the structure to hold together as long as Meta keeps paying for everything and the accounting rules remain generously uninterested in economic reality.</p><p>We assume, with the confidence of people who have clearly not been punished enough:</p><ul><li><p>Meta will preserve an AA-/Stable profile because any other outcome would force everyone involved to admit what this actually is.</p></li><li><p>Construction will stay “broadly on schedule,” a phrase we use to pre-forgive whatever happens as long as Meta covers the overruns, which it must.</p></li><li><p>Lease payments and the minimum rent schedule will continue producing a DSCR that hovers around 1.12 in models designed to ensure that result, and not materially below 1.10 unless something un-modeled happens, which we classify as “outside scope.”</p></li><li><p>The RVG will remain enforceable, which matters more than the resale value of a hyperscale facility in a world where hyperscale facilities may or may not be worth anything.</p></li><li><p>Changes in VIE or lease-accounting guidance will affect where Meta stores the debt, not whether Meta pays it.</p></li></ul><p>We could lower the rating if Meta were downgraded, if DSCR sagged below the range we pretend is acceptable, if Meta weakened its guarantees, or if events unfold in ways our assumptions did not account for, as events tend to do. The last category includes anything that would force us to revisit the assumptions we confidently made without testing.</p><p>We view an upgrade as unlikely. The structure already performs the single miracle it was designed for: keeping $27.3 billion off Meta’s balance sheet in a manner we are professionally obligated to support.</p><p><strong>CONFIDENTIALITY AND USE:</strong><span> This report is intended solely for institutional investors, entities required by compliance to review documents they will not read, and any regulatory body still pretending to monitor off-balance-sheet arrangements. FSG LLC makes no representation, warranty, or faint gesture toward coherence regarding the accuracy, completeness, or legitimacy of anything contained herein. By reading this document, you irrevocably acknowledge that we did not perform due diligence in any conventional, philosophical, or legally enforceable sense. Our review consisted of rereading Meta’s press release until repetition produced acceptance, aided by a Magic 8-Ball we shook until it agreed.</span></p><p><strong>LIMITATION OF RELIANCE:</strong><span> Any resemblance to objective analysis is coincidental and should not be relied upon by anyone with fiduciary obligations, ethical standards, a working memory, or the ability to perform basic subtraction. Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that will not survive contact with reality, stress testing, most Tuesdays, or a modest change in interest rates. FSG LLC is not liable for losses arising from reliance on this report, misunderstanding this report, fully understanding this report, or the sinking recognition that you should have known better. Past performance is not indicative of future results, except in the specific case of rating agencies repeating the same mistakes at larger scales with increasing confidence.</span></p><p><strong>RATING METHODOLOGY:</strong><span> The rating assigned herein may be revised, withdrawn, or denied ever existing if Meta consolidates the debt, Louisiana ceases to exist for tax purposes, or the data center becomes self-aware and moves to Montana to escape the heat. FSG LLC calculated the A+ rating using a proprietary model consisting of discounted cash flows, interpretive dance, and whatever number Meta’s CFO sounded comfortable with on a diligence call we did not in fact attend. Readers who discover material errors in this report are contractually obligated to keep them to themselves and accept that being technically correct is the least valuable form of correct.</span></p><p><strong>GENERAL PROVISIONS:</strong><span> By continuing to read, you consent to the proposition that what Meta does not consolidate does not exist, waive your right to say “I told you so” when this unravels, and accept that the term “investment grade” is now a disposition rather than a metric. FSG LLC reserves the right to amend, retract, deny, or disown this report at any time, particularly if Congress shows interest or someone notes that $27 billion off-balance-sheet is on a balance sheet somewhere.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<div dir="ltr" lang="de">
			<p>
				<strong>Petition richtet sich an:</strong>
									Deutscher Bundestag Petitionsausschuss							</p>

			<!--marker--><p>Open-Source-Software bildet heute das Fundament großer Teile der digitalen Infrastruktur – in Verwaltung, Wirtschaft, Forschung und im täglichen Leben. Selbst im aktuellen <b>Koalitionsvertrag</b> der <b>Bundesregierung</b> wird Open-Source-Software als elementarer Baustein zur Erreichung  <b>digitaler Souveränität</b> genannt.</p><p>Dennoch wird die Arbeit, die tausende Freiwillige dafür leisten, in Deutschland steuer- und förderrechtlich <b>nicht als Ehrenamt anerkannt</b>. Dieses Ungleichgewicht zwischen gesellschaftlicher Bedeutung und rechtlichem Status gilt es zu korrigieren.</p><p>Als aktiver Contributor in Open-Source-Projekten fordere ich daher, Open-Source-Arbeit als <b>gemeinwohlorientiertes Ehrenamt</b> anzuerkennen – gleichrangig mit Vereinsarbeit, Jugendarbeit oder Rettungsdiensten.</p>		</div>

					<h4>Begründung</h4>

			<div dir="ltr" lang="de">
				<!--marker--><p><b>1. Open-Source trägt nachweislich zum Gemeinwohl bei</b><br></p><ul><li>Open-Source-Projekte schaffen <b>freie, transparente und überprüfbare Software</b>, die allen zugutekommt.</li><li>Kritische Systeme wie <b>Internet-Protokolle, Sicherheitsbibliotheken, Gesundheits-IT, KI-Frameworks, Energieverwaltung, Bildungstechnologien und Kommunikationswerkzeuge</b> basieren maßgeblich auf freiwilligen Beiträgen.</li><li>Ohne diese Arbeit wäre Deutschland digital <b>abhängiger, weniger sicher und weniger innovativ</b>.</li></ul><p>Gemeinwohlorientierung ist ein zentrales Kriterium für ein Ehrenamt – und Open-Source erfüllt dieses in höchstem Maße.</p><p><b>2. Die Arbeit geschieht überwiegend unbezahlt – und ist freiwilliges bürgerschaftliches Engagement</b><br></p><ul><li>Die Mehrheit aller Entwicklungs-, Wartungs- und Dokumentationsleistungen erfolgt <b>ehrenamtlich in der Freizeit</b>.</li><li>Contributor übernehmen Verantwortung für <b>Sicherheit, Stabilität und Weiterentwicklung</b> zentraler Softwarekomponenten, ohne Vergütung und oft ohne Anerkennung.</li><li>Das Engagement ist <b>vergleichbar mit Tätigkeiten in gemeinnützigen Vereinen</b>, nur eben digital.</li></ul><p>Die rechtliche Gleichstellung mit klassischem Ehrenamt wäre daher folgerichtig.</p><p><b>3. Gesellschaftliche Abhängigkeit ohne gesellschaftliche Anerkennung</b><br></p><ul><li>Staatliche Einrichtungen, Kommunen, Schulen und Unternehmen <b>profitieren direkt</b> von Open-Source-Bibliotheken, Frameworks und Tools.</li><li>Sicherheitslücken wie „Heartbleed“ oder Log4Shell haben gezeigt, wie entscheidend die Arbeit der Maintainer für das <b>Schutzinteresse der Allgemeinheit</b> ist.</li><li>Gleichzeitig fehlen Ressourcen und Strukturen, weil die Arbeit <b>formal nicht als Ehrenamt</b> eingestuft ist – und damit <i>keinerlei steuerliche oder organisatorische Förderung</i> erhält.</li></ul><p>Dies erzeugt eine <b>unausgewogene Verantwortungslast</b>, die auf wenigen Freiwilligen liegt, während Millionen Nutzer*innen profitieren.</p><p><b>4. Anerkennung als Ehrenamt würde Rechtsklarheit schaffen</b></p><p>Durch eine formelle Anerkennung könnten:<br></p><ul><li><b>Aufwandsentschädigungen steuerfrei</b> gewährt werden (Ehrenamtspauschale/Übungsleiterpauschale).</li><li><b>Gemeinnützige Open-Source-Projekte</b> eine leichtere Einstufung nach §52 AO erreichen.</li><li>Contributor bei Haftungsfragen besser gestellt werden (analog zu §31a BGB für Vereinsvorstände).</li><li>Projekte rechtssicher Kosten erstatten oder Spendenquittungen ausstellen.</li></ul><p>Dies schafft <b>Transparenz</b>, <b>Rechtssicherheit</b> und <b>Nachhaltigkeit</b> im digitalen Ehrenamt.</p><p><b>5. Digitalisierung braucht freiwillige Kompetenz – und diese verdient Förderung</b><br></p><ul><li>Open-Source-Engagement erfordert hohe technische Kompetenz.</li><li>Freiwillige Entwickler*innen leisten Arbeit, die Unternehmen ansonsten für hohe Stundensätze einkaufen müssten.</li><li>Der Staat investiert Milliarden in Digitalisierung, ignoriert aber die Menschen, die die technologische Basis <b>freiwillig</b> pflegen.</li></ul><p>Eine Anerkennung als Ehrenamt wäre ein <b>kosteneffizienter Beitrag zur digitalen Souveränität</b> Deutschlands.</p><p><b>6. Deutschland hinkt international hinterher</b></p><p>Andere Staaten fördern Open-Source-Engagement bereits durch:</p><ul><li>steuerliche Begünstigungen</li><li>institutionelle Förderung</li><li>Anerkennung gemeinnütziger Softwareentwicklung</li></ul><p>Deutschland riskiert, im globalen Wettbewerb zurückzufallen, wenn Freiwilligenarbeit im digitalen Raum weiterhin <b>strukturell benachteiligt</b> wird.</p>			</div>

And it’s super obvious. That seems like a very fundamental thing.</em><span>”</span></p><p>Some of this may come as news to a lot of the machine learning community; it might be surprising coming from Sutskever, who is an icon of deep learning, having worked, inter alia, on the critical 2012 paper that showed how much GPUs could improve deep learning, the foundation of LLMs, in practice. He is also a co-founder of OpenAI, considered by many to have been their leading researcher until he departed after a failed effort to oust Sam Altman. </p><p><span>But none of what Sutskever said should actually come as a surprise, especially not to readers of this Substack, or to anyone who followed me over the years. Essentially </span><em>all</em><span> of it was in my pre-GPT 2018 article “</span><em><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.00631" rel="">Deep learning: A Critical Appraisal</a></em><span>”, which argued for neurosymbolic approaches to complement neural networks (as Sutskever now is), for more </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05667" rel="">innate</a><span> (i.e., built-in, rather than learned) constraints (what Sutskever calls “new inductive constraints”) and/or in my 2022 “</span><em><a href="https://nautil.us/deep-learning-is-hitting-a-wall-238440/" rel="">Deep learning is hitting a wall</a></em><span>” evaluation of LLMs, which explicitly argued that the Kaplan scaling laws would eventually reach a point of diminishing returns (as Sutskever just did), and that problems with hallucinations, truth, generalization and reasoning would persist even as models scaled, much of which Sutskever just acknowledged.  </span></p><p><span>Subbarao Kambhampati, meanwhile, has been arguing or years about </span><a href="https://cotopaxi.eas.asu.edu/" rel="">limits on planning with LLMs</a><span>. Emily Bender has been saying for ages that an excess focus on LLMs has been “sucking the oxygen from the room” relative to other research approaches. The </span><a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/garymarcus/p/a-knockout-blow-for-llms?r=8tdk6&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false" rel="">unfairly dismissed Apple reasoning paper</a><span> laid bare the generalization issues; another paper called “</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01191v3" rel="">Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs Mirage? A Data Distribution Lens</a><span>” put a further nail in the LLM reasoning and generalization coffin. </span></p><p><em>None</em><span> of what Sutskever said should come as a surprise.

To be sure, the VC get even richer still if the investments pan out, to be sure. but they are covered either way; even if it all falls apart, the venture capitalists themselves will become wealthy from the management fees alone. (It is their clients, such as pension funds, that will take the hit). So venture capitalists may continue to support LLM mania, at least for a while.</p><p>But let’s suppose for the sake of argument that Sutskever and the rest of us are correct, and that AGI will never emerge straight from LLMs, and that to a certain extent that they have run their course, and that we do in fact need new ideas. </p><p>The question then becomes, what did it cost the field and society that it took so long for the machine learning mainstream to figure out what some of us, including virtually the entire neurosymbolic AI community had been saying for years?</p><p>§</p><p>The first and most obvious answer is money, which I estimate, back of the envelope as (roughly) a trillion dollars, much of it on Nvidia chips and massive salaries. (Zuckerberg has apparently hired some machine learning experts at salaries of $100,000,000 a year). </p><p><span>According to Ed Zitron’s calculations, “</span><a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/big-tech-2tr/" rel="">Big Tech Needs $2 Trillion In AI Revenue By 2030 or They Wasted Their Capex</a><span>”. If Sutskever and I are right about the limits of LLMs, the only way to get to that $2T is to invent new ideas.</span></p><p>If the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results, trillion dollar investments in ever more expensive experiments aiming to reach AGI may be delusional to the highest degree.</p><p>To a first approximation, all the big tech companies, from OpenAI to Google to Meta to xAI to Anthropic to several Chinese companies, keep doing the same experiment over and over: building ever larger LLMs in hopes of reaching AGI. </p><p><span>It has never worked. Each new bigger, more expensive model ekes out measurable improvements, but returns appear to be diminishing (that’s what Sutskever is saying about </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361" rel="">the Kaplan laws</a><span>) and none of these experiments has solved core issues around hallucinations, generalization, planning and reasoning, as Sutskever too now recognizes. </span></p><p><span>But it’s not just that a trillion dollars or more might go down the drain, but that there might be considerable collateral damage, to the rest of society, both economic and otherwise (e.g., in terms of how </span><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/openai-chatgpt-ai-cheating-education-college-students-school.html" rel="">LLMs have undermined college education</a><span>). As Rogé Karma put in a recent article in The Atlantic, “</span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/09/ai-bubble-us-economy/684128/" rel="">The entire U.S. economy is being propped up by the promise of productivity gains that seem very far from materializing.</a><span>”   </span></p><p>To be fair,  nobody knows for sure what the blast radius would be. If LLM-powered AI didn’t meet expectations and became valued less, who would take the hit? Would it  just be the “limited partners” like pension funds who entrusted their money with VC firms? Or might the consequences be much broader? Might banks go down with the ship, in 2008-style liquidity crisis,possibly forcing taxpayers to bail them out? In the worst case, the impact of a deflated AI bubble could be immense. (Consumer spending, much of it fueled by wealthy people who could a hit on the stock market, might also drop, a recipe for recession.) </p><p>Even the White House has admitted concerns about this. As the White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks himself put it earlier this week, referring to a Wall Street Journal analysis, “Al-related investment accounts for half of GDP growth. A reversal [in that]  would risk recession.”  </p><p>Quoting from Karma’s article in The Atlantic :</p><blockquote><p><span>That prosperity [that GenAI was supposed to deliver]  has largely yet to materialize anywhere other than their share prices. (The exception is Nvidia, which provides the crucial inputs—advanced chips—that the rest of the Magnificent Seven are buying.) As </span><em>The Wall Street Journal</em><span> reports, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have seen their </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/the-ai-booms-hidden-risk-to-the-economy-731b00d6" rel="">free cash flow</a><span> decline by 30 percent over the past two years. By one </span><a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-haters-gui/" rel="">estimate</a><span>, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Tesla will by the end of this year have collectively spent $560 billion on AI-related capital expenditures since the beginning of 2024 and have brought in just $35 billion in AI-related revenue. OpenAI and Anthropic are </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/anthropic-hits-3-billion-annualized-revenue-business-demand-ai-2025-05-30/" rel="">bringing</a><span> in lots of revenue and are growing fast, but they are still </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-does-not-expect-be-cash-flow-positive-until-2029-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-03-26/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="">nowhere</a><span> </span><a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/anthropic-projects-soaring-growth-34-002016322.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="">near</a><span> profitable. Their valuations—roughly </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/01/business/dealbook/openai-ai-mega-funding-deal.html" rel="">$300 billion</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/anthropics-valuation-more-than-doubles-183-billion-after-13-billion-fundraise-2025-09-02/" rel="">$183 billion</a><span>, respectively, and </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/technology/openai-chatgpt-stock-sale-valuation.html" rel="">rising</a><span>—are many multiples higher than their current revenues. (OpenAI </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-26/openai-expects-revenue-will-triple-to-12-7-billion-this-year" rel="">projects</a><span> about $13 billion in revenues this year; </span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropic-projects-soaring-growth-to-34-5-billion-in-2027-revenue" rel="">Anthropic</a><span>, $2 billion to $4 billion.) Investors are betting heavily on the prospect that all of this spending will soon generate record-breaking profits. If that belief collapses, however, investors might start to sell en masse, causing the market to experience a large and painful correction.</span></p><p>…</p><p><span>The dot-com crash was bad, but it did not trigger a crisis. An AI-bubble crash could be different. AI-related investments have already </span><a href="https://paulkedrosky.com/honey-ai-capex-ate-the-economy/" rel="">surpassed</a><span> the level that telecom hit at the peak of the dot-com boom as a share of the economy. In the first half of this year, business spending on AI added more to GDP growth than all consumer spending </span><em>combined</em><span>. Many experts believe that a major reason the U.S. economy has been able to weather tariffs and mass deportations without a recession is because all of this AI spending is acting, in the </span><a href="https://paulkedrosky.com/honey-ai-capex-ate-the-economy/" rel="">words</a><span> of one economist, as a “massive private sector stimulus program.” An AI crash could lead broadly to less spending, fewer jobs, and slower growth, potentially dragging the economy into a recession. The economist Noah Smith </span><a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy" rel="">argues</a><span> that it could even lead to a financial crisis if the unregulated “private credit” loans funding much of the industry’s expansion all go bust at once.</span></p></blockquote><p>The whole thing looks incredibly fragile. </p><p>§</p><p>To put it bluntly, the world has gone “all in” on LLMs, but, as Sutskever’s interview highlights, there are many reasons to doubt that LLMs will ever deliver the rewards that many people expected. </p><p>The sad part is that most of the reasons have been known – though not widely accepted – for a very long time.  It all could have been avoided. But the machine learning community has arrogantly excluded other voices, and indeed whole other fields like the cognitive sciences. And we all now may be about to pay the price. </p><p>An old saying about such follies is that “six months in the lab can you save you an afternoon in the library”; here we may have wasted a trillion dollars and several years to rediscover what cognitive science already knew.</p><p>A trillion dollars is a terrible amount of money to have perhaps wasted. If the blast radius is wider it could be a lot more. It is all starting to feel like a tale straight out of Greek tragedy, an avoidable mixture of arrogance and power that just might wind up taking down the economy. </p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

If it didn’t include the word “literally” I’d assume some poetic license on the part of whoever, or whatever, wrote this. But even then it would be crazy wrong.</p><p>I’m not surprised or perturbed by the underlying sentiment. Some of my endings have been controversial for a long time. Tastes differ. Some readers would prefer more conclusive endings. Now, in some cases, such as Snow Crash, I simply can’t fathom why any reader could read the ending—a long action sequence in which the Big Bad is defeated, the two primary antagonists meet their maker and Y.T. is reconciled and reunited with her mother—as anything other than a proper wind-up to the story. In other cases, notably The Diamond Age and Seveneves, I can understand why readers who prefer a firm conclusion would end up being frustrated. It is simply not what I was trying to do in those books. So, for a long time, people have argued about some of my endings, and that’s fine.</p><p>In this case, though, we have a big company explicitly stating that several of my best-known books just stop mid-sentence, and putting in the word “literally” to eliminate any room for interpretive leeway.</p><p>This isn’t literary criticism, which consists of statements of opinion. This is a factual assertion that is (a) false, (b) easy to fact-check, and (c) casts my work ethic, and that of my editors, in an unflattering light.</p><p>It is interesting to speculate as to how such an assertion found its way onto A16Z’s website!</p><p>By far the most plausible explanation is that this verbiage was generated by an AI and then copy-pasted into the web page by a human who didn’t bother to fact-check it. This would explain the misspelling of my name and some peculiarities in the writing style. Of course, this kind of thing is happening all the time now in law, academia, journalism, and other fields, so it’s pretty unremarkable; it just caught my attention because it’s the first time it’s directly affected me.</p><p>The flow diagram looks like this:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png" width="1456" height="1091" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1091,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:138336,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://nealstephenson.substack.com/i/179984587?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VJvc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bc418b3-07f2-41ed-bd3d-7161d8ebcdb0_1516x1136.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>That does a pretty good job of explaining how this all might have come about.

It could be that the person (or the AI) who wrote the above excerpt decided to save some money by downloading one of those, and got a bad copy that was cut off in mid-sentence.</span></p><p>Even in the legit publishing industry, the quality of translations can be quite variable, and it’s difficult for authors to know whether a given translation was any good. I’ve seen translated editions of some of my books that look suspiciously short on page count. For all I know there might be translations of my books (legit or bootleg) that actually do stop mid-sentence!</p><p>I genuinely am grateful to have been included on this list! But I had to say something about this astonishing howler embedded in the otherwise reasonable verbiage.</p><p>Even the most cynical and Internet-savvy among us are somehow hard-wired to take anything we read on the Internet at face value. I’m as guilty as the next person. This has been a bad idea for a long time now, since bad actors have been swarming onto the Internet for decades.  Now, though, it’s a bad idea for a whole new reason: content we read on the Internet might not have been written by a person with an intent to misinform, but rather by an LLM with no motives whatsoever, and no underlying model of reality that enables it to determine fact from fiction.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

Radioactive iodine was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/chernobyl/faqs">a leading cause of death</a> in the first days and weeks, and, later, of cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>In an attempt to reduce the risk of radiation poisoning and long-term health complications, a 30km (19 mile) exclusion zone – also known as the "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sites.se.manchester.ac.uk/nuclearhitchhiker/2017/03/10/637/">zone of alienation" – was established</a> to keep people at a distance from the worst of the radioactive remains of reactor four.</p><p>But while humans were kept away, Zhdanova's black mould had slowly colonised the area.</p></div><div data-component="layout-block"><figure><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mjnsb9.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Germán Orizaola/Pablo Burraco Ionising radiation may have led tree frogs inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone to have darker skin (left) than those outside it (right) (Credit: Germán Orizaola/ Pablo Burraco)"><span>Germán Orizaola/Pablo Burraco</span></p><figcaption>Ionising radiation may have led tree frogs inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone to have darker skin (left) than those outside it (right) (Credit: Germán Orizaola/ Pablo Burraco)</figcaption></figure><p>Like plants reaching for sunlight, Zhdanova's research indicated that the fungal hyphae of the black mould seemed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0953756209810575">attracted</a> to ionising radiation. But "radiotropism", as Zhdanova called it, was a paradox: ionising radiation is generally far more powerful than sunlight, a barrage of radioactive particles that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK401323/">shreds through DNA and proteins</a> like bullets puncture flesh. The damage it causes can trigger harmful mutations, destroy cells and kill organisms.</p><p>Along with the apparently radiotropic fungi, Zhdanova's surveys found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0953756208615026">36 other species of ordinary, but distantly related, fungi growing</a> around Chernobyl. Over the next two decades, her pioneering work on the radiotropic fungi she identified would reach far outside of Ukraine. It would add to knowledge of a potentially <a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2677413/">new foundation of life</a> on Earth – one that thrives on radiation rather than sunlight. And it would lead scientists at Nasa to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/ames/could-future-homes-on-the-moon-and-mars-be-made-of-fungi/">consider surrounding their astronauts in walls of fungi</a> for a durable form of life support.</p><p>At the centre of this story is a pigment found widely in life on Earth: melanin. This molecule, which can range from black to reddish brown, is what leads to different skin and hair colours in people. But it is also the reason why the various species of mould growing in Chernobyl were black. Their cell walls were <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0953756209810575">packed</a> with melanin.</p><p>Just as darker skin protects our cells from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, Zhdanova suspected that the melanin of these fungi was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1369527408001306?via%3Dihub">acting as a shield</a> against ionising radiation.</p></div><div data-component="layout-block"><div><p><span>Just as those black moulds colonised an abandoned world at Chernobyl, perhaps they could one day protect our first steps on new worlds elsewhere in the Solar System</span></p></div><p>It wasn't just fungi that were harnessing melanin's protective properties. In the ponds around Chernobyl, frogs with higher concentrations of melanin in their cells, and so darker in colour, were <a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/chernobyl-black-frogs-reveal-evolution-in-action-191034">better able to survive and reproduce</a>, slowly turning the local population living there black.</p><p>In warfare, a shield might protect a soldier from an arrow by deflecting the projectile away from their body. But melanin doesn't work like this. It isn't a hard or smooth surface. The radiation – whether UV or radioactive particles – is <a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2677413/">swallowed by its disordered structure</a>, its energy <a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2671032/">dissipated rather than deflected</a>. Melanin is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459156/">also an antioxidant</a>, a molecule that can turn the reactive ions that radiation produces in biological matter and return them to a stable state.</p><p>In 2007, Ekaterina Dadachova, a nuclear scientist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, added to Zhdanova's work on Chernobyl's fungi, revealing that their growth wasn't just directional (radiotropic) but actually <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17520016/">increased</a> in the presence of radiation. Melanised fungi, just like those inside Chernobyl's reactor, grew 10% faster in the presence of radioactive Caesium compared to the same fungi cultured without radiation, she found. Dadachova and her team also found that the melanised fungi that were irradiated appeared to be using the energy to help drive its metabolism. In other words, they were using it to grow.</p><figure><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mjntqd.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Elsevier/ Zhdanova et al. 2000 Cultures found in the fourth unit at Chernobyl, including Cladosporium sphaerospermum.

These fungi weren't just growing towards radiation for warmth or some unknown reaction between radiation and its surroundings as Zhdanova had suggested. Dadachova believed the fungi were actively feeding on the radiation's energy. She called this process "<a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17520016/">radiosynthesis</a>". And melanin was central to the theory.</p><p>"The energy of ionising radiation is around one million times higher than the energy of white light, which is used in photosynthesis," says Dadachova. "So you need a pretty powerful energy transducer, and this is what we think melanin is capable of doing – to transduce [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ionizing-radiation-and-health-effects">ionising radiation</a>] into usable levels of energy."&nbsp;</p><p>Radiosynthesis is still just a theory, as it can only be proven if the precise mechanism between melanin and metabolism is discovered. Scientists would need to find the exact receptor – or a particular nook in melanin's convoluted structure – that is involved in converting radiation into energy for growth.</p><p>In more recent years, Dadachova&nbsp;and her colleagues have started to identify some of the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32389299/">pathways</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33425251/">proteins</a>&nbsp;that might underlie the fungi's increase in growth with ionising radiation.&nbsp;</p><p>Not all melanised fungi show a tendency for radiotropism and positive growth in the presence of radiation. A 2006 <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16821711/">study</a> from Zhdanova and her colleagues, for example, found that only nine of the 47 species of melanised fungi they collected at Chernobyl grew towards a source of radioactive caesium (caesium-137).&nbsp;</p></div><div data-component="layout-block"><p>Similarly, in 2022, scientists at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-16063-z">found no difference in growth</a> when two species of fungi (one melanised, one not) were exposed to UV radiation and caesium-137.</p><p>But that same year, the same tendency for fungal growth when exposed to radiation <a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.877625/full">was found again –</a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.877625/full"> in space</a>.</p><p>Different from the radioactive decay found at Chernobyl, so-called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/analog-field-testing/why-space-radiation-matters/">galactic cosmic radiation</a> is an invisible storm of charged protons, each travelling near the speed of light through the Universe.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="4189490c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
					<p>European governments have taken another step toward reviving the EU’s controversial <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/chat-control-2-0-eu-moves-toward-ending-private-communication">Chat Control agenda</a>, approving a new negotiating mandate for the Child Sexual Abuse Regulation in a closed session of the Council of the European Union on November 26.</p>
<p>The measure, presented as a tool for child protection, is once again drawing heavy criticism for its surveillance implications and the way it reshapes private digital communication in Europe.</p>
<p>Unlike earlier drafts, this version <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/eus-weakened-chat-control-bill-still-poses-major-privacy-risks">drops the explicit obligation</a> for companies to scan all private messages but quietly introduces what opponents describe as an indirect system of pressure.</p>
<p>It rewards or penalizes online services depending on whether they agree to carry out “voluntary” scanning, effectively making intrusive monitoring a business expectation rather than a legal requirement.</p>
<p>Former MEP Patrick Breyer, a long-standing defender of digital freedom and one of the most vocal opponents of the plan, said the deal “paves the way for a permanent infrastructure of mass surveillance.”</p>
<p>According to him, the Council’s text replaces legal compulsion with financial and regulatory incentives that push major US technology firms toward indiscriminate scanning.</p>
<p>He warned that the framework also brings “anonymity-breaking age checks” that will turn ordinary online use into an exercise in identity verification.</p>
<p>The new proposal, brokered largely through Danish mediation, comes months after the original “Chat Control 1.0” regulation appeared to have been shelved following widespread backlash.</p>
<p>It reinstates many of the same principles, requiring providers to assess their potential “risk” for child abuse content and to apply “mitigation measures” approved by authorities. In practice, that could mean pressure to install scanning tools that probe both encrypted and unencrypted communications.</p>
<p>Czech MEP Markéta Gregorová called the Council’s position “a disappointment…Chat Control…opens the way to blanket scanning of our messages.”</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CnZOD1FJo2Zk.jpg" alt="Dark-mode screenshot of a verified Twitter/X post warning that the EU Council approved “Chat Control,” allowing blanket scanning of messages, while saying the European Parliament opposes it; an embedded Czech headline reads “EU states agreed on a proposal against child pornography, Czechia voted against”; timestamp Nov 26, 2025, 5:04 AM and 88.9K views are shown." width="776" height="604" srcset="https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CnZOD1FJo2Zk.jpg 776w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CnZOD1FJo2Zk-300x234.jpg 300w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CnZOD1FJo2Zk-768x598.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px"></p>
<p>Similar objections emerged across Europe.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, members of parliament forced their government to vote against the plan, warning that it combines “mandatory age verification” with a “voluntary obligation” scheme that could penalize any company refusing to adopt invasive surveillance methods. Poland and the Czech Republic also voted against, and Italy abstained.</p>
<p>Former Dutch MEP Rob Roos accused Brussels of operating “behind closed doors,” warning that “Europe risks sliding into digital authoritarianism.”</p>
<p>Beyond parliamentarians, independent voices such as Daniel Vávra, David Heinemeier Hansson, and privacy-focused company Mullvad have spoken out against the Council’s position, calling it a direct threat to private communication online.</p>
<p>Despite the removal of the word “mandatory,” the structure of the new deal appears to preserve mass scanning in practice.</p>
<p>Breyer described it as a “Trojan Horse,” arguing that by calling the process “voluntary,” EU governments have shifted the burden of surveillance to tech companies themselves.</p>
<p>The Council’s mandate introduces three central dangers that remain largely unacknowledged in the public debate.</p>
<p>First, so-called “voluntary scanning” turns mass surveillance into standard operating procedure. The proposal extends the earlier temporary regulation that allowed service providers to scan user messages and images without warrants.</p>
<p>Authorities like Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office have reported that roughly<a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/germany-chat-control-false-reports-surveillance-encryption-privacy"> half the alerts from such systems are baseless</a>, often involving completely legal content flagged by flawed algorithms. Breyer said these systems leak “tens of thousands of completely legal, private chats” to law enforcement every year.</p>
<p>Second, the plan effectively erases anonymous communication. To meet the new requirement to “reliably identify minors,” providers will have to implement universal age checks. This likely means ID verification or face scans before accessing even basic services such as email or messaging apps.</p>
<p>For journalists, activists, and anyone who depends on anonymity for protection, this system could make easy private speech functionally impossible.</p>
<p>Technical experts have repeatedly warned that age estimation “cannot be performed in a privacy-preserving way” and carries “a disproportionate risk of serious privacy violation and discrimination.”</p>
<p>Third, it risks digitally isolating young people. Under the Council’s framework, users under 17 could be blocked from many platforms unless they pass strict identity verification, including chat-enabled games and messaging services. Breyer called this idea “pedagogical nonsense,” arguing that it excludes teenagers instead of helping them develop safe online habits.</p>
<p>Member states remain divided: the Netherlands, Poland, and the Czech Republic rejected the text, while Italy abstained. Negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council are expected to begin soon, aiming for a final version before April 2026.</p>
<p>Breyer warned that the apparent compromise is no real retreat from surveillance. “The headlines are misleading: Chat Control is not dead, it is just being privatized,” he said. “We are facing a future where you need an ID card to send a message, and where foreign black-box AI decides if your private photos are suspicious. This is not a victory for privacy; it is a disaster waiting to happen.”</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Glasses to detect smart-glasses that have cameras</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">I'm experimenting with 2 main approaches:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="#optics">Optics</a>: classify the camera using light reflections.</li>
<li><a href="#networking">Networking</a>: bluetooth and wi-fi analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">So far fingerprinting specific devices based on bluetooth (BLE) is looking like easiest and most reliable approach. The picture below is the first version, which plays the legend of zelda 'secret found' jingle when it detects a BLE advertisement from Meta Raybans.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/blob/main/banrays_physical_v1.png"><img src="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/raw/main/banrays_physical_v1.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I'm essentially treating this README like a logbook, so it will have my current approaches/ideas.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Optics</h2><a id="user-content-optics" aria-label="Permalink: Optics" href="#optics"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">By sending IR at camera lenses, we can take advantage of the fact that the CMOS sensor in a camera reflects light directly back at the source (called 'retro-reflectivity' / 'cat-eye effect') to identify cameras.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/blob/main/irrb.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/raw/main/irrb.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This isn't exactly a new idea. Some researchers in 2005 used this property to create 'capture-resistant environments' when smartphones with cameras were gaining popularity.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/papers/cre.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/papers/cre.pdf</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">There's even some recent research (2024) that figured out how to classify individual cameras based on their retro-reflections.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-32-8-13836" rel="nofollow">https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-32-8-13836</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Now we have a similar situation to those 2005 researchers on our hands, where smart glasses with hidden cameras seem to be getting more popular. So I want to create a pair of glasses to identify these. Unfortunately, from what I can tell most of the existing research in this space records data with a camera and then uses ML, a ton of controlled angles, etc. to differentiate between normal reflective surfaces and cameras.</p>
<p dir="auto">I would feel pretty silly if my solution uses its own camera. So I'll be avoiding that. Instead I think it's likely I'll have to rely on being consistent with my 'sweeps', and creating a good classifier based on signal data. For example you can see here that the back camera on my smartphone seems to produce quick and large spikes, while the glossy screen creates a more prolonged wave.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/blob/main/ts_plot_labeled.png"><img src="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/raw/main/ts_plot_labeled.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/blob/main/ts_plot_spikes.png"><img src="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/raw/main/ts_plot_spikes.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">After getting to test some Meta Raybans, I found that this setup is not going to be sufficient. Here's a test of some sweeps of the camera-area + the same area when the lens is covered. You can see the waveform is similar to what I saw in the earlier test (short spike for camera, wider otherwise), but it's wildly inconsistent and the strength of the signal is very weak. This was from about 4 inches away from the LEDs. I didn't notice much difference when swapping between 940nm and 850nm LEDs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/blob/main/ir_rayban_first_sweeps.png"><img src="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/raw/main/ir_rayban_first_sweeps.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">So at least with current hardware that's easy for me to access, this probably isn't enough to differentiate accurately.</p>
<p dir="auto">Another idea I had is to create a designated sweep 'pattern'. The user (wearing the detector glasses) would perform a specific scan pattern of the target. Using the waveforms captured from this data, maybe we can more accurately fingerprint the raybans. For example, sweeping across the targets glasses in a 'left, right, up, down' approach. I tested this by comparing the results of the Meta raybans vs some aviators I had lying around. I think the idea behind this approach is sound (actually it's light), but it might need more workshopping.</p>

<p dir="auto">For prototyping, I'm using:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Arduino uno</li>
<li>a bunch of 940nm and 850nm IR LEDs</li>
<li>a photodiode as a receiver</li>
<li>a 2222A transistor</li>

<p dir="auto">TODO:</p>
<ul dir="auto">

<li>experiment with combining data from different wavelengths</li>
<li>collimation?</li>

<p dir="auto">This has been more tricky than I first thought! My current approach here is to fingerprint the Meta Raybans over Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) advertisements. But, <strong>I have only been able to detect BLE traffic during 1) pairing 2) powering-on</strong>. I sometimes also see the advertisement as they are taken out of the case (while already powered on), but not consistently.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/blob/main/ble_detect.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/NullPxl/banrays/raw/main/ble_detect.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The goal is to detect them during usage when they're communicating with the paired phone, but to see this type of directed BLE traffic it seems like I would first need to see the <code>CONNECT_REQ</code> packet which has information as to what which of the communication channels to hop between in sync. I don't think what I currently have (ESP32) is set up to do this kind of following.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>potentially can use an <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Sniffer-for-Bluetooth-LE" rel="nofollow">nRF module</a> for this</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For any of the bluetooth classic (BTC) traffic, unfortunately the hardware seems a bit more involved (read: expensive). So if I want to do down this route, I'll likely need a more clever solution here.</p>
<p dir="auto">When turned on or put into pairing mode (or sometimes when taken out of the case), I can detect the device through advertised manufacturer data and service UUIDs. <code>0x01AB</code> is a Meta-specific SIG-assigned ID (assigned by the Bluetooth standards body), and <code>0xFD5F</code> in the Service UUID is assigned to Meta as well.</p>

<p>Cheap Chinese battery electric heavy trucks are no longer a rumor. They are real machines with real price tags that are so low that they force a reassessment of what the global freight industry is willing to pay for electrification. Standing in a commercial vehicle hall in Wuhan and seeing a 400 kWh or 600 kWh truck priced between €58,000 and €85,000, as my European freight trucking electrification contact <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnnynijenhuisetruck_johnnyinchina-activity-7399133525314281473-vW50?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAABbtwBpXWZZtB8v6K_lwf8yVP9nmwrGyI">Johnny Nijenhuis recently did</a>, changes the frame of the entire conversation. These are not diesel frames with a battery box welded underneath. They are purpose built electric trucks built around LFP packs, integrated e-axles and the simplified chassis architecture that becomes possible when the engine bay, gearbox, diesel tank, emissions controls and half of the mechanical complexity of a truck disappear. Anyone who has worked with heavy vehicles knows the cost structure of diesel powertrains. Removing that entire system while building at very large scale produces numbers that do not match Western experience.</p>
<p>China’s low price electric trucks do not arrive as finished products for Europe or North America. They need work. Western short haul freight fleets expect certain features that Chinese domestic buyers usually skip. Tires need to carry E-mark or FMVSS certification. Electronic stability controls must meet UNECE R13 or FMVSS 121. Cab structures need to meet R29 or similar requirements. Crash protection for battery packs needs to satisfy R100 or FMVSS 305. European drivers expect better seats, quieter cabs and stronger HVAC. Even in short haul work, fleets expect well understood advanced driver assistance (ADAS) features to handle traffic and depot work. However, inexpensive Chinese leaf springs are just fine for short haul trucking given the serious upgrade to driver comfort and truck performance of battery electric drivetrains.</p>
<p>When these adjustments are added into the bill of materials and spread across a production run, the upgrades land in the €20,000 to €40,000 range for short haul duty, per my rough estimate. That moves the landed price up to roughly €80,000 to €120,000. The comparison with Western OEM offerings is stark because Western battery electric trucks today often start near €250,000 and can move far higher once options and charging hardware are included. A short haul operator looking at the difference between a €100,000 truck and a €300,000 truck will ask which one meets the actual duty cycle. For operators with depot charging and predictable delivery routes, the cheaper truck is credible in a way that few expected even three years ago.</p>
<p>The long haul story is different. European and North American long haul operators require far more from a truck than a Chinese domestic short range tractor offers. Axle loads need to support 40 to 44 ton gross combined weight. Suspension needs to manage high speed stability for many hours a day on roads built for 80 to 100 km/h cruising. Cab structures must handle fatigue and cross winds on long corridors. Drivers spend nights sleeping in the cab and expect western comfort standards. Trailer interfaces require specific electrical and pneumatic systems that have to meet long established norms. Battery safety systems need to be built for high speed impacts and rollover events. All of that requires a larger budget. The gap between a domestic Chinese tractor and a European or North American long haul tractor is roughly €80,000 to €120,000 once all mechanical, safety and comfort systems are brought to the required levels per my estimate. That does not erase the cost advantage, because even a €180,000 Chinese based long haul electric truck is cheaper than many Western models, but it does shift the choice from simple purchase price to service expectations and lifetime durability.</p>
<p>Most freight is not long haul. <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/06/france-germanys-economic-councils-endorse-electric-trucks-over-hydrogen/">French and German economic councils</a> have both looked at freight movements through national data and concluded that the majority of truck trips and ton kilometers occur in short haul service. This includes urban deliveries, regional distribution, logistics shuttles between depots and ports, construction supply and waste collection. These trips are usually under 250 km, begin and end at the same depot and involve repeated stop-start movement where electric drivetrains perform well. The idea that the heavy trucking problem is a long haul problem has shaped Western investment priorities for a decade, but national economic councils in Europe now argue that solving short haul electrification first delivers most of the benefit. The fact that low cost Chinese battery electric trucks map almost perfectly onto these duty cycles suggests that they will find receptive markets once import pathways are established.</p>

<p>China’s shift away from diesel in the heavy truck segment is dramatic. The country sold more than 900,000 heavy trucks in 2024. Diesel’s share fell to about 57% that year. Natural gas trucks rose to around 29%. Battery electric trucks reached 13%. Early 2025 data points to battery electric share rising again to about 22% of new heavy truck sales, with diesel falling close to the 50% mark. These shifts are large movements inside a very conservative sector. Natural gas trucks saw a rapid rise between 2022 and 2024 as operators chased lower fuel prices and simpler emissions compliance, but the price war in battery electric trucks has made electric freight attractive for many of the same operators. Gas trucks still fill some niches, but the pattern suggests that they may face the same pressure that diesel trucks face. Electric trucks with low running costs and high cycle life begin to look compelling to operators once the purchase price falls into a familiar range.</p>
<p>Western OEMs entered China with hopes of capturing a share of the largest truck market in the world, but the results have been mixed. Joint ventures like Foton Daimler once offered a bridge into domestic heavy trucking, yet the rapid rise of low cost local manufacturers in both diesel and electric segments has eroded that position. Western models arrived with higher prices and platforms optimized for different regulations and freight conditions. As domestic OEMs expanded capacity and cut costs, the market shifted toward local brands in every drivetrain category. The impact is clear. Western firms now face reduced market share, weaker margins and strategic uncertainty about long term participation in China’s truck sector.</p>
<p>Underlying these drivetrain transitions is a heavy truck market that is smaller and more complicated than it was five years ago. The peak in 2020, with roughly 1.6 million heavy trucks sold, was not a normal year. It was driven by a large regulatory pre-buy that pulled forward sales before tighter emissions rules arrived. The freight economy was also stronger at that time and the construction sector had not yet entered its recent slowdown. As those drivers faded, the market returned to what looks like a long term equilibrium between 800,000 and one million trucks per year. Several confounding factors overlap in this period. Freight volumes shifted. Rail took a larger share of bulk transport as China achieved what North America and Europe have only talked about, mode shifting. Replacement cycles grew longer. Real estate and construction slowed. Diesel’s loss of share is partly driven by these economic factors and partly driven by the arrival of cheaper alternatives. It is difficult to separate the exact contribution of each. The net result is a natural market size that is much lower than the 2020 peak and a much more competitive fight inside the remaining market.</p>
<p>Hydrogen heavy truck sales in China show a pattern of stalling growth followed by early signs of decline in 2025. Registration data and industry reports indicate that fuel cell heavy trucks were less than 1% of the heavy truck market in 2024, amounting to low single digit thousands of vehicles, and most of these were tied to provincial demonstration subsidies rather than broad fleet adoption. In the first half of 2025 the number of registered hydrogen trucks rose slightly on paper, but analysts inside China noted that real world operation rates were low and that several local programs were winding down as subsidies tightened. At the same time battery electric heavy trucks climbed from 13% of new sales in 2024 to 22% in early 2025. Hydrogen heavy trucks are losing ground inside a market that is moving quickly toward lower cost electric models, and operators are stepping away from fuel cell platforms as more credible electric options appear. I didn’t bother to include hydrogen on the truck statistics chart as it’s a rounding error and not increasing.</p>
<p>One indicator that connects these pieces is diesel consumption. China’s diesel use dropped by about 11% year over year at one point in 2024, which is not a small shift in a country with heavy commercial transport. Part of the drop was due to economic slowing in trucking dominant sectors, but the rise of LNG trucks and electric trucks also contributed. When a truck that once burned diesel every day is replaced by a gas or battery electric truck, national fuel consumption reacts quickly. The fuel market sees these changes earlier than the headline truck sales numbers because thousands of trucks operating every day create a measurable signal in fuel demand. The data is consistent with a freight system that is changing in composition and technology at a pace that would have seemed unlikely a few years earlier.</p>
<p>Western operators have to look at this landscape with practical questions in mind. The leading electric bus manufacturer in Europe is Chinese because it built functional electric buses at lower prices before Western firms did. There is no reason the same pattern will not repeat in trucks. Once the cost of a short haul electric truck falls near the cost of a diesel truck, operators will start to buy them. If the imported option is much cheaper than the domestic option, early fleets will run the numbers and make decisions based on cash flow and reliability. Western OEMs face challenges in this environment because their legacy designs and cost structures are not tuned for the kind of price war that emerged in China. They need to match cost while preserving safety and service expectations, which is difficult while shifting from a century of diesel design to a new electric architecture.</p>
<p>Western OEMs entered the electric truck market with the platforms they already understood. Most began by taking a diesel tractor frame, removing the engine and gearbox and adding batteries, motors and the associated power electronics. This approach kept production lines moving and reduced near term engineering risk, but it produced electric trucks that carried the compromises of diesel architecture. Battery boxes hung from ladder frames, wiring loops wound through spaces never designed for high voltage systems and weight distribution was optimized for a drivetrain that no longer existed. Several OEMs even explored hydrogen drivetrains inside the same basic frames, which locked in the limitations of a platform built around an internal combustion engine. The results were heavier trucks with less space for batteries, higher costs and lower overall efficiency.</p>
<p>The shift toward purpose built electric tractors is only now underway among the major Western OEMs. Volvo’s FH Electric and FM Electric, Daimler’s eActros 300 and 600, Scania’s new battery electric regional tractor and MAN’s eTruck all represent clean sheet or near clean sheet electric designs with integrated drivetrains and optimized battery packaging. These models move Western OEMs closer to the design philosophy that Chinese manufacturers adopted earlier, where the entire platform is built around the electric driveline from the start.</p>
<p>China has moved faster toward battery electric heavy trucks than any other major market. It built supply chains for motors, inverters, LFP cells, structural packs and integrated e-axles. It created standard designs and cut costs through volume. It encouraged competition. It is now exporting electric trucks into Asia, Latin America and Africa. Europe and North America are watching this unfold while debating the right charging standards and duty cycle models. The arrival of low cost electric trucks from China raises uncomfortable questions for Western OEMs and policymakers, but it also provides an opportunity. If freight electrification can happen at one third the expected cost, then the pace of decarbonization can be much faster. The challenge is deciding how to integrate or respond to the cost structure that China has already built.</p>
<p>The story of heavy trucking is no longer a slow migration from diesel to a distant alternative. The transition is already underway at scale inside the world’s largest heavy truck market. It does not look like the long haul hydrogen scenario that dominated Western modelling for the last decade. It looks like battery electric trucks built cheaply and deployed quickly into short haul service. The economic logic is straightforward. The operational fit is strong. The supply chain is built. The lesson for Western operators and policymakers is that the cost curve has shifted. The decisions that made sense even in 2024 do not match the realities of 2025. The market is moving toward electric freight because it is becoming cheaper than diesel across the majority of real world duty cycles. From the short haul electric trucks will come the new generation of long haul trucks, as night follows day. The arrival of low cost battery trucks from China marks the beginning of a new phase in freight decarbonization.</p>

In History looks at how an unassuming cartoonist built a billion-dollar empire out of the lives of a group of children, a dog and a bird.</b></p><p>Charles M Schulz's timeless creation Charlie Brown may have been as popular as any character in all of literature, but the cartoonist was modest about the scope of his miniature parables. In a 1977 BBC interview, he said: "I'm talking only about the minor everyday problems in life. Leo Tolstoy dealt with the major problems of the world. I'm only dealing with why we all have the feeling that people don't like us."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This did not mean that he felt as if he was dealing with trivial matters. He said: "I'm always very much offended when someone asks me, 'Do I ever do satire on the social condition?' Well, I do it almost every day. And they say, 'Well, do you ever do political things?' I say, 'I do things which are more important than politics. I'm dealing with love and hate and mistrust and fear and insecurity.'"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption>WATCH: 'Cartooning is drawing funny pictures whether they're silly or rather meaningful political cartoons'.</figcaption></div><p>While Charlie Brown may have been the eternal failure, the universal feelings that Schulz channelled helped make <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20181112-good-grief-the-beguiling-philosophy-of-peanuts">Peanuts</a> a global success. Born in 1922, Schulz drew every single Peanuts strip himself from 1950 until his death in February 2000. It was so popular that Nasa named two of the modules in its May 1969 <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4M9zXf4hWZhHMdhZrDhn472/seven-things-you-might-not-know-about-peanuts">Apollo 10 lunar mission</a> after Charlie Brown and Snoopy. The strip was syndicated in more than 2,600 newspapers worldwide, and inspired films, music and countless items of merchandise.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of its success, according to the writer Umberto Eco, was that it worked on different levels. <a target="_blank" href="http://:%20https:/www.nybooks.com/articles/1985/06/13/on-krazy-kat-and-peanuts/">He wrote</a>: "Peanuts charms both sophisticated adults and children with equal intensity, as if each reader found there something for himself, and it is always the same thing, to be enjoyed in two different keys. Peanuts is thus a little human comedy for the innocent reader and for the sophisticated."&nbsp;</p><p>Schulz's initial reason for focusing on children in the strip was strictly commercial. In 1990, he <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCArchive/videos/139456464818589/">told the BBC</a>: "I always hate to say it, but I drew little kids because this is what sold. I wanted to draw something, I didn't know what it was, but it just seemed as if whenever I drew children, these were the cartoons that editors seemed to like the best. And so, back in 1950, I mailed a batch of cartoons to New York City, to United Features Syndicate, and they said they liked them, and so ever since I've been drawing little kids."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

    </div><p>Bird flu viruses are a particular threat to humans because they can replicate at temperatures higher than a typical fever, one of the body's ways of stopping viruses in their tracks, according to new research led by the universities of Cambridge and Glasgow.</p>

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         
										    


                                                                                                                                    <p>In a study published today in <i>Science</i>, the team identified a gene that plays an important role in setting the temperature sensitivity of a virus. In the deadly pandemics of 1957 and 1968, this gene transferred into human flu viruses, and the resulting virus thrived.</p>
<h2>How flu viruses thrive in the body</h2>
<p>Human flu viruses cause millions of infections every year. The most common types of these viruses, which cause seasonal flu, are known as influenza A viruses. They tend to thrive in the upper respiratory tract, where the temperature is around 33°C, rather than deep in the lungs in the lower respiratory tract, where the temperature is around 37°C.</p>
<p>Unchecked, a virus will replicate and spread throughout the body, where it can cause illness, occasionally severe. One of the body's self-defense mechanisms is fever, which can cause our body temperature to reach as high as 41°C, though until now it has not been clear how fever stops viruses—and why some viruses can survive.</p>
<p>Unlike human flu viruses, avian influenza viruses tend to thrive in the lower respiratory tract. In fact, in their natural hosts, which include ducks and seagulls, the virus often infects the gut, where temperatures can be as high as 40°C–42°C.</p>
<h2>Research methods and findings</h2>
<p>In previous studies using cultured cells, scientists have shown that avian influenza viruses appear more resistant to temperatures typically seen in fever in humans. Today's study uses in vivo models—mice infected with influenza viruses—to help explain how fever protects us and why it may not be enough to protect us against avian influenza.</p>

                                                                                                        
    
                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>An international team led by scientists in Cambridge and Glasgow simulated in mice what happens during a fever in response to influenza infections. To carry out the research, they used a laboratory-adapted influenza virus of human origin, known as PR8, which does not pose a risk to humans.</p>
<p>Although mice do not typically develop fever in response to influenza A viruses, the researchers were able to mimic its effect on the virus by raising the ambient temperature where the mice were housed (elevating the body temperature of the mice).</p>
<p>The researchers showed that raising body temperature to fever levels is effective at stopping human-origin flu viruses from replicating, but it is unlikely to stop avian flu viruses. Fever protected against severe infection from human-origin flu viruses, with just a 2°C increase in body temperature enough to turn a lethal infection into a mild disease.</p>
<p>The research also revealed that the PB1 gene of the virus, important in the replication of the virus genome inside infected cells, plays a key role in setting the temperature-sensitivity. Viruses carrying an avian-like PB1 gene were able to withstand the high temperatures associated with fever, and caused severe illness in the mice. This is important, because human and bird flu viruses can "swap" their genes when they co-infect a host at the same time, for example when both viruses infect pigs.</p>

                                                                                                                                            <h2>Expert perspectives and implications</h2>
<p>Dr. Matt Turnbull, the first author of the study, from the Medical Research Council Center for Virus Research at the University of Glasgow said, "The ability of viruses to swap genes is a continued source of threat from emerging flu viruses. We've seen it happen before during previous pandemics, such as in 1957 and 1968, where a human virus swapped its PB1 gene with that from an avian strain. This may help explain why these pandemics caused serious illness in people.</p>
<p>"It's crucial that we monitor bird flu strains to help us prepare for potential outbreaks. Testing potential spillover viruses for how resistant they are likely to be to fever may help us identify more virulent strains."</p>
<p>Senior author Professor Sam Wilson, from the Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease at the University of Cambridge, said, "Thankfully, humans don't tend to get infected by bird flu viruses very frequently, but we still see dozens of human cases a year. Bird flu fatality rates in humans have traditionally been worryingly high, such as in historic H5N1 infections that caused more than 40% mortality.</p>
<p>"Understanding what makes bird flu viruses cause serious illness in humans is crucial for surveillance and pandemic preparedness efforts. This is especially important because of the pandemic threat posed by avian H5N1 viruses."</p>
<p>The findings may have implications for the treatment of infections, though the team stresses that more research is needed before changes are considered for treatment guidelines. Fever is often treated with antipyretic medications, which include ibuprofen and aspirin. However, there is clinical evidence that treating fever may not always be beneficial to the patient and may even promote transmission of influenza A viruses in humans.</p>

<p>Technology provider Polar Night Energy and utility Lahti Energia have partnered for a large-scale project using Polar’s ‘Sand Battery’ technology for the latter’s district heating network in Vääksy, Finland. </p>



<p>The project will have a heating power of 2MW and a thermal energy storage (TES) capacity of 250MW, making it a 125-hour system and the largest sand-based TES project once complete. </p>



<p>It will supply heat to Lahti Energia’s Vääksy district heating network but is also large enough to participate in Fingrid’s reserve and grid balancing markets. </p>



<p>Polar Night Energy’s technology works by heating a sand or a similar solid material using electricity, retaining that heat and then discharging that for industrial or heating use. </p></div><div><div><div>

<p>The project will cut fossil-based emissions in the Vääksy district heating network by around 60% each year, by reducing natural gas use bu 80% and also decreasing wood chip consumption.</p>



<p>It follows Polar Night Energy <a href="https://www.energy-storage.news/100mwh-sand-battery-goes-into-commercial-operation-in-finland/">completing and putting a 1MW/100MWh Sand Battery TES project into commercial operations this summer</a>, for another utility&nbsp;Loviisan Lämpö. That project uses soapstone as its storage medium, a byproduct of ceramics production. </p>



<p>This latest project will use locally available natural sand, held in a container 14m high and 15m wide. Lahti Energia received a grant for the project from state body Business Finland.</p>



<p>Polar Night Energy will act as the main contractor for the construction project, with on-site work beginning in early 2026, and the Sand Battery will be completed in summer 2027.</p>



<p>“We want to offer our customers affordable district heating and make use of renewable energy in our heat production. The scale of this Sand Battery also enables us to participate in Fingrid’s reserve and grid balancing markets. As the share of weather-dependent energy grows in the grid, the Sand Battery will contribute to balancing electricity supply and demand”, says Jouni Haikarainen, CEO of Lahti Energia.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/2022-11-23-a-friendly-abstraction-over-iouring-and-kqueue/">https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/2022-11-23-a-friendly-abstraction-over-iouring-and-kqueue/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46073817">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Consider this tale of I/O and performance. We’ll start with blocking
I/O, explore io_uring and kqueue, and take home an event loop very
similar to some software you may find familiar.</p>
<p>This is a twist on King’s talk at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8OO4vQMTw">Software You Can Love
Milan ’22</a>.</p>
<h2 id="classical-approach"></h2>
<p>When you want to read from a file you might <code>open()</code> and
then call <code>read()</code> as many times as necessary to fill a
buffer of bytes from the file. And in the opposite direction, you call
<code>write()</code> as many times as needed until everything is
written. It’s similar for a TCP client with sockets, but instead of
<code>open()</code> you first call <code>socket()</code> and then
<code>connect()</code> to your server. Fun stuff.</p>
<p>In the real world though you can’t always read everything you want
immediately from a file descriptor. Nor can you always write everything
you want immediately to a file descriptor.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12773509/read-is-not-blocking-in-socket-programming/12775464#12775464">switch
a file descriptor into non-blocking mode</a> so the call won’t block
while data you requested is not available. But system calls are still
expensive, incurring context switches and cache misses. In fact,
networks and disks have become so fast that these costs can start to
approach the cost of doing the I/O itself. For the duration of time a
file descriptor is unable to read or write, you don’t want to waste time
continuously retrying read or write system calls.</p>
<h2 id="batching-and-readiness"></h2>
<p>So you switch to io_uring on Linux or kqueue on FreeBSD/macOS. (I’m
skipping the generation of epoll/select users.) These APIs let you
submit requests to the kernel to learn about readiness: when a file
descriptor is ready to read or write. You can send readiness requests in
batches (also referred to as queues). Completion events, one for each
submitted request, are available in a separate queue.</p>
<p>Being able to batch I/O like this is especially important for TCP
servers that want to multiplex reads and writes for multiple connected
clients.</p>
<p>However in io_uring, you can even go one step further. Instead of
having to call <code>read()</code> or <code>write()</code> in userland
after a readiness event, you can request that the kernel do the
<code>read()</code> or <code>write()</code> itself with a buffer you
provide. Thus almost all of your I/O is done in the kernel, amortizing
the overhead of system calls.</p>
<p>If you haven’t seen io_uring or kqueue before, you’d probably like an
example! Consider this code: a simple, minimal, not-production-ready TCP
echo server.</p>

<span id="cb1-67">    }</span>
<span id="cb1-68">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is a great, minimal example. But notice that this code ties
io_uring behavior directly to business logic (in this case, handling
echoing data between request and response). It is fine for a small
example like this. But in a large application you might want to do I/O
throughout the code base, not just in one place. You might not want to
keep adding business logic to this single loop.</p>
<h2 id="central-io-dispatch"></h2>
<p>Instead, you might want to be able to schedule I/O and pass a
callback (and sometimes with some application context) to be called when
the event is complete.</p>
<p>The interface might look like:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1">io_dispatch<span>.</span>dispatch({</span>
<span id="cb2-2">    <span>// some big struct/union with relevant fields for all event types</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">}<span>,</span> my_callback);</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is great! Now your business logic can schedule and handle I/O no
matter where in the code base it is.</p>
<p>Under the hood it can decide whether to use io_uring or kqueue
depending on what kernel it’s running on. The dispatch can also batch
these individual calls through io_uring or kqueue to amortize system
calls. The application no longer needs to know the details.</p>
<p>Additionally, we can use this wrapper to stop thinking about
readiness events, just I/O completion. That is, if we dispatch a read
event, the io_uring implementation would actually ask the kernel to read
data into a buffer. Whereas the kqueue implementation would send a
“read” readiness event, do the read back in userland, and then call our
callback.</p>
<p>And finally, now that we’ve got this central dispatcher, we don’t
need spaghetti code in a loop switching on every possible submission and
completion event.</p>
<h2 id="interacting-with-the-submission-and-completion-queue"></h2>
<p>Every time we call io_uring or kqueue we both submit event requests
and poll for completion events. The io_uring and kqueue APIs tie these
two actions together in the same system call.</p>
<p>To sync our requests to io_uring or kqueue we’ll build a
<code>flush</code> function that submits requests and polls for
completion events. (In the next section we’ll talk about how the user of
the central dispatch learns about completion events.)</p>
<p>To make <code>flush</code> more convenient, we’ll build a nice
wrapper around it so that we can submit as many requests (and process as
many completion events) as possible. To avoid accidentally blocking
indefinitely we’ll also introduce a time limit. We’ll call the wrapper
<code>run_for_ns</code>.</p>
<p>Finally we’ll put the user in charge of setting up a loop to call
this <code>run_for_ns</code> function, independent of normal program
execution.</p>
<p>This is now your traditional event loop.</p>
<h2 id="callbacks-and-context"></h2>
<p>You may have noticed that in the API above we passed a callback. The
idea is that after the requested I/O has completed, our callback should
be invoked. But the question remains: how to track this callback between
the submission and completion queue?</p>
<p>Thankfully, io_uring and kqueue events have user data fields. The
user data field is opaque to the kernel. When a submitted event
completes, the kernel sends a completion event back to userland
containing the user data value from the submission event.</p>
<p>We can store the callback in the user data field by setting it to the
callback’s pointer casted to an integer. When the completion for a
requested event comes up, we cast from the integer in the user data
field back to the callback pointer. Then, we invoke the callback.</p>
<h2 id="getting-more-expressive"></h2>
<p>As described above, the struct for <code>io_dispatch.dispatch</code>
could get quite large handling all the different kinds of I/O events and
their arguments. We could make our API a little more expressive by
creating wrapper functions for each event type.</p>
<p>So if we wanted to schedule a read function we could call:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1">io_dispatch<span>.</span>read(fd<span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span>buf<span>,</span> nBytesToRead<span>,</span> callback);</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or to write, similarly:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1">io_dispatch<span>.</span>write(fd<span>,</span> buf<span>,</span> nBytesToWrite<span>,</span> callback);</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="overflow"></h2>
<p>One more thing we need to worry about is that the batch we pass to
io_uring or kqueue has a fixed size (technically, kqueue allows any
batch size but using that might introduce unnecessary allocations). So
we’ll build our own queue on top of our I/O abstraction to keep track of
requests that we could not immediately submit to io_uring or kqueue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To keep this API simple we could allocate for each entry in the
queue. Or we could modify the <code>io_dispatch.X</code> calls slightly
to accept a struct that can be used in an <a href="https://www.data-structures-in-practice.com/intrusive-linked-lists/">intrusive
linked list</a> to contain all request context, including the callback.
The latter is <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/d15acc663f8882cb02413129e8351bf3238335e6/src/io/linux.zig#L665">what
we do in TigerBeetle</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put another way: every time code calls <code>io_dispatch</code>,
we’ll try to immediately submit the requested event to io_uring or
kqueue. But if there’s no room, we store the event in an overflow
queue.</p>
<p>The overflow queue needs to be processed eventually, so we update our
<code>flush</code> function (described in <a href="#callbacks-and-context">Callbacks and context</a> above) to pull
as many events from our overflow queue before submitting a batch to
io_uring or kqueue.</p>
<h2 id="a-step-back"></h2>
<p>We’ve now built something similar to <a href="https://github.com/libuv/libuv">libuv</a>, the I/O library that
Node.js uses. And if you squint, it is basically TigerBeetle’s I/O
library! (And interestingly enough, TigerBeetle’s I/O code was <a href="https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/e14a3af491ece8d1b0309e76ae3022b4fad91f16/src/io/io_linux.zig#L704">adopted</a>
into Bun! Open-source for the win!)</p>
<p>Let’s check out how the <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/9d3552ba137a773d4b81106739e56cba6cd32a03/src/io/darwin.zig#L436">Darwin
version</a> of TigerBeetle’s I/O library (with kqueue) differs from the

version</a>. As mentioned, the complete <code>send</code> call in the
Darwin implementation waits for file descriptor readiness (through
kqueue). Once ready, the actual <code>send</code> call is made back in
userland:</p>

for event processing. Look at <code>run_for_ns</code> on <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/9d3552ba137a773d4b81106739e56cba6cd32a03/src/io/linux.zig#L66]">Linux</a>

for the public API users must call. And finally, look at what puts this
all into practice, the loop calling <code>run_for_ns</code> in
src/main.zig.</p>
<h2 id="windows-and-iocp"></h2>
<p>We’ve come this far and you might be wondering — what about
cross-platform support for Windows? The good news is that Windows also
has a completion based system similar to io_uring but without batching,
called <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/i-o-completion-ports">IOCP</a>.
And for bonus points, TigerBeetle provides the <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/9d3552ba137a773d4b81106739e56cba6cd32a03/src/io/windows.zig">same
I/O abstraction over it</a>! But it’s enough to cover just Linux and
macOS in this post. :)</p>
<h2 id="beyond-a-single-thread"></h2>
<p>In both this blog post and in TigerBeetle, we implemented a
single-threaded event loop. Keeping I/O code single-threaded in
userspace is beneficial (whether or not I/O processing is
single-threaded in the kernel is not our concern). It’s the simplest
code and best for workloads that are not embarrassingly parallel. It is
also best for determinism, which is integral to the design of
TigerBeetle because it enables us to do Deterministic Simulation
Testing</p>
<p>But there are other valid architectures for other workloads.</p>
<p>For workloads that are embarrassingly parallel, like many web
servers, you could instead use multiple threads where each thread has
its own queue. In optimal conditions, this architecture has the highest
I/O throughput possible.</p>
<p>But if each thread has its own queue, individual threads can become
starved if an uneven amount of work is scheduled on one thread. In the
case of dynamic amounts of work, the better architecture would be to
have a single queue but multiple worker threads doing the work made
available on the queue.</p>
<h2 id="standalone-cross-platform-evented-io-library"></h2>
<p>Hey, maybe we’ll split this out so you can use it too. It’s written
in Zig so we can easily expose a C API. Any language with a C foreign
function interface (i.e. every language) should work well with it. Keep
an eye on <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle">our GitHub</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FileZilla Pro “Perpetual License” - A Warning to All Users</h2><a id="user-content-filezilla-pro-perpetual-license---a-warning-to-all-users" aria-label="Permalink: FileZilla Pro “Perpetual License” - A Warning to All Users" href="#filezilla-pro-perpetual-license---a-warning-to-all-users"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is a blunt warning to anyone who ever purchased, or is thinking about purchasing, FileZilla Pro.</p>
<p dir="auto">I bought FileZilla Pro under a <strong>perpetual license</strong> - a one-time payment, lifetime right to use the version I purchased. After reinstalling my operating system, I simply needed to reinstall the software I already paid for.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Here’s what happened:</h3><a id="user-content-heres-what-happened" aria-label="Permalink: Here’s what happened:" href="#heres-what-happened"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Support admitted I <strong>still have the legal right</strong> to use the old version of FileZilla Pro that I originally purchased.</li>
<li>Then they told me they <strong>refuse to provide the installer</strong> for that version.</li>
<li>Their excuse: <em>“For security reasons we do not provide older versions.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The impact:</h3><a id="user-content-the-impact" aria-label="Permalink: The impact:" href="#the-impact"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If a customer cannot download the installer, the “perpetual license” is <strong>dead</strong>.
It doesn’t matter what rights they acknowledge on paper - they are blocking any practical way to use the software unless you pay again under their new subscription model.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is no way to reinstall.
There is no way to access the product you bought.
Your “perpetual license” effectively becomes worthless the moment you reinstall your OS or lose the installer.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What this means for users:</h3><a id="user-content-what-this-means-for-users" aria-label="Permalink: What this means for users:" href="#what-this-means-for-users"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">FileZilla is fully aware that customers legally own those old versions.
They openly admit it.
And then they withhold the installer anyway, leaving users with no realistic option except paying again.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you’re considering FileZilla Pro, understand exactly what you are walking into:
You can pay for a perpetual license, and later be denied any way to reinstall the product you legally own.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Name clarification</h3><a id="user-content-name-clarification" aria-label="Permalink: Name clarification" href="#name-clarification"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Although “Zilla” appears in the name, the FileZilla project is not affiliated with Mozilla in any way. I mention this because, at the time I purchased FileZilla Pro, I personally assumed the project was connected to Mozilla. That assumption made me trust the product more than I should have, and I learned the truth the hard way.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Copyright</h3><a id="user-content-copyright" aria-label="Permalink: Copyright" href="#copyright"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Tim Kosse</strong>, FileZilla author and trademark owner</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">My Perspective</h3><a id="user-content-my-perspective" aria-label="Permalink: My Perspective" href="#my-perspective"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Based on my experience, I believe FileZilla’s refusal to provide the installer is driven by financial motives rather than security. In the very first email I received from support, before offering any real help, they immediately suggested that I buy the newest version and even offered me a discount. That interaction, combined with the fact that they were still providing updates to the copy already installed on my computer, makes the security explanation hard to accept and reinforces my belief that the real motive is financial.</p>

    <p>That if you’re a life form and you cook up a baby and copy your genes to them, you’ll find that the genes have been degraded due to oxidative stress et al., which isn’t cause for celebration, but if you find some other hopefully-hot person and randomly swap in half of their genes, your baby will still be somewhat less fit compared to you and your hopefully-hot friend on average, but now there is variance, so if you cook up several babies, one of them might be as fit or even fitter than you, and that one will likely have more babies than your other babies have, and thus complex life can persist in a universe with increasing entropy.</p>

    <p>That if you look back at history, you see that plagues went from Europe to the Americas but not the other way, which suggests that urbanization and travel are great allies for infectious disease, and these both continue today but are held in check by sanitation and vaccines even while we have lots of tricks like UVC light and high-frequency sound and air filtration and waste monitoring and paying people to stay home that we’ve barely even put in play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That while engineered infectious diseases loom ever-larger as a potential very big problem, we also have lots of crazier tricks we <em>could</em> pull out like panopticon viral screening or toilet monitors or daily individualized saliva sampling or engineered microbe-resistant surfaces or even dividing society into cells with rotating interlocks or having people walk around in little personal spacesuits, and while admittedly most of this doesn’t sound awesome, I see no reason this shouldn’t be a battle that we would win.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That clean water, unlimited, almost free.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That dentistry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That tongues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That radioactive atoms either release a ton of energy but also quickly stop existing—a gram of Rubidium-90 scattered around your kitchen emits as much energy as ~200,000 incandescent lightbulbs but after an hour only 0.000000113g is left—or don’t put out very much energy but keep existing for a long time—a gram of Carbon-14 only puts out the equivalent of 0.0000212 light bulbs but if you start with a gram, you’ll still have 0.999879g after a year—so it isn’t actually <em>that</em> easy to permanently poison the environment with radiation although Cobalt-60 with its medium energy output and medium half-life is unfortunate, medical applications notwithstanding I still wish Cobalt-60 didn’t exist, screw you Cobalt-60.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That while curing all cancer would only increase life expectancy by ~3 years and curing all heart disease would only increase life expectancy by ~3 years, and preventing all accidents would only increase life expectancy by ~1.5 years, if we did all of these at the same time and then a lot of other stuff too, eventually the effects would go nonlinear, so trying to cure cancer isn’t actually a waste of time, thankfully.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the peroxisome, while the mitochondria and their stupid Krebs cycle get all the attention, when a fatty-acid that’s too long for them to catabolize comes along, who you gonna call.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That we have preferences, that there’s no agreed ordering of how good different things are, which is neat, and not something that would obviously be true for an alien species, and given our limited resources probably makes us happier on net.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That cardamom, it is cheap but tastes expensive, if cardamom cost 1000× more, people would brag about how they flew to Sri Lanka so they could taste chai made with fresh cardamom and swear that it changed their whole life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Gregory of Nyssa, he was right.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Grandma Moses, it’s not too late.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sleep, that probably evolution first made a low-energy mode so we don’t starve so fast and then layered on some maintenance processes, but the effect is that we live in a cycle and when things aren’t going your way it’s comforting that reality doesn’t stretch out before you indefinitely but instead you can look forward to a reset and a pause that’s somehow neither experienced nor skipped.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, glamorous or not, comfortable or not, cheap or not, carbon emitting or not, air travel is very safe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, for most of the things you’re worried about, the markets are less worried than you and they have the better track record, though not the issue of your mortality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sexual attraction to romantic love to economic unit to reproduction, it’s a strange bundle, but who are we to argue with success.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That every symbolic expression recursively built from differentiable elementary functions has a derivative that can also be written as a recursive combination of elementary functions, although the latter expression may require vastly more terms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That every expression graph built from differentiable elementary functions and producing a scalar output has a gradient that can itself be written as an expression graph, and furthermore that the latter expression graph is always the same size as the first one and is easy to find, and thus that it’s possible to fit very large expression graphs to data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, eerily, biological life and biological intelligence does not appear to make use of that property of expression graphs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That if you look at something and move your head around, you observe the entire light field, which is a five-dimensional function of three spatial coordinates and two angles, and yet if you do something fancy with lasers, somehow that entire light field can be stored on a single piece of normal two-dimensional film and then replayed later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, as far as I can tell, the reason five-dimensional light fields can be stored on two-dimensional film simply cannot be explained without quite a lot of wave mechanics, a vivid example of the strangeness of this place and proof that all those physicists with their diffractions and phase conjugations really are up to something.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That disposable plastic, littered or not, harmless when consumed as thousands of small particles or not, is popular for a reason.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That disposable plastic, when disposed of correctly, is literally carbon sequestration, and that if/when air-derived plastic replaces dead-plankton-derived plastic, this might be incredibly convenient, although it must be said that currently the carbon in disposable plastic only represents a single-digit percentage of total carbon emissions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That rocks can be broken into pieces and then you can’t un-break the pieces but you can check that they came from the same rock, it’s basically cryptography.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the deal society has made is that if you have kids then everyone you encounter is obligated to chip in a bit to assist you, and this seems to mostly work without the need for constant grimy negotiated transactions as Econ 101 would suggest, although the exact contours of this deal seem to be a bit murky.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That of all the humans that have ever lived, the majority lived under some kind of autocracy, with the rest distributed among tribal bands, chiefdoms, failed states, and flawed democracies, and only something like 1% enjoyed free elections and the rule of law and civil liberties and minimal corruption, yet we endured and today that number is closer to 10%, and so if you find yourself outside that set, do not lose heart.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That if you were in two dimensions and you tried to eat something then maybe your body would split into two pieces since the whole path from mouth to anus would have to be disconnected, so be thankful you’re in three dimensions, although maybe you could have some kind of jigsaw-shaped digestive tract so your two pieces would only jiggle around or maybe you could use the same orifice for both purposes, remember that if you ever find yourself in two dimensions, I guess.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ramones.dev/posts/linkedin-is-loud/">https://ramones.dev/posts/linkedin-is-loud/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46072988">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: this is based on emotions and not much else</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm so tired of reading the same post 10x because everyone wants to be included.</p>
<p>What's hot right now is the CloudFlare outage. Everyone misses the actual issue which was that there were no (automated) tests/QA that were done to prevent this bug. Even a feature flag would've been sufficient so they could've seen the issue early-on.</p>
<p>This is what every LinkedIn poster does:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open ChatGPT</li>
<li>"Rewrite this linkedin post about the cloudflare outage"</li>
<li><em>AI steers towards the use of <code>.unwrap()</code></em></li>
<li><em>LinkedIn man doesn't fact check anything or reads the post-mortem</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Result:
"Le unwrap is le dangerous. Here's how the unwrap works"</p>
<p>I'm so fucking tired. I don't care about your company, nor do I care about you. I don't care because YOU don't care either about what you post. You don't care about your career, only how it looks. In hindsight, this is the perfect representation of how LLM's function, so I'm not surprised managers are best friends with ChatGPT.</p>
<p>I'm not surprised corporate social media is lifeless, but I'm surprised no one actually cares. How do these people stay motivated to do anything. It can't just be money, right?</p>
<p>I added a disclaimer because I do feel like this post is very short-sighted. This feeling roots into the fact I'm tired of corporate hell, and these feelings resulted in me not being very productive at work. This also resulted in me being let go soon (also known as a PIP!).</p>
<p>You can skip this part if you don't care about my career.</p>
<p>When I started out at $COMPANY, it was mostly building tools with, from time to time, a manager doing a check-up. This worked amazingly, as I had time to learn and improve, and I was able to deliver.</p>
<p>Fast-forward a few months, we now have 3 managers, 1 dev (hi), and a buttload of busywork that needs to be done yesterday. From what I understand, a manager is supposed to be your safetynet and keep the context switching to a minimum. Tickets should feel like little updates, yet they take up 40% of my work (which could've been spent on solutioning). Since I'm the lead dev, any busywork will move tickets further back. This also means I'm to blame, because I should've been way earlier with alerting <em>them</em> about the project's drift. I'M NOT A PM! It's my job to make the project and keep you up to date. If this isn't sufficient then go to the PM (oh wait, that's not me!). Another big issue I have with this workflow is that we're sometimes moving priorization mid-cycle due to client requests. This is fine if it wasn't low priority stuff a client <em>wants</em> but doesn't <em>need</em>.</p>
<p>I get almost nothing done and I've grown tired of living in Linear. I wouldn't say I'm burnt-out. Similarly to an orgasm, you'd know if you had one. The company has turned into a startup with only the shortcomings and all of the corporate hell I wanted to avoid.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, I'm being let go in January (as well as other people at the company). 2026 is going to start interestingly, but I think it would be free-ing. I still wish everyone at the company the best, because there are some smart and kind people I will miss.</p>
