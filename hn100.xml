<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>The Brazilian supreme court has ordered that X be suspended in the country after the social media platform failed to meet a deadline to appoint a legal representative in the country.</p><p>Late on Friday afternoon, Justice Alexandre de Moraes – who has been engaged in a dispute with X’s owner, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Elon Musk</a>, since April – ordered the “immediate, complete and total suspension of X’s operations” in the country, “until all court orders … are complied with, fines are duly paid, and a new legal representative for the company is appointed in the country”.</p><p>He gave Brazil’s National Telecommunications Agency 24 hours to enforce the decision. Once notified, the agency must pass the order on to the more than 20,000 broadband internet providers in the country, each of which must block <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">X</a>.</p><p>In an interview with the TV channel Globonews, the agency’s president, Carlos Manuel Baigorri, said the order had already been passed on to internet providers.</p><p>“Since we’re talking about more than 20,000 companies, each will have its own implementation time, but … we expect that probably over the weekend all companies will be able to implement the block,” he said.</p><p>Justice Moraes also summoned Apple and Google to “implement technological barriers to prevent the use of the X app by users of the iOS and Android systems” and to block the use of VPN applications.</p><p>The decision imposes a daily fine of R$50,000 (£6,800) on individuals and companies that attempt to continue using X via VPN.</p><p>The deadline given to X to appoint a new legal representative in the country expired at 8.07pm local time on Thursday (0.07am BST on Friday). An hour later, Elon Musk’s social network <a href="https://twitter.com/GlobalAffairs/status/1829296715989414281" data-link-name="in body link">announced</a> that it would not comply.</p><p>The dispute began in April, when Moraes ordered the suspension of dozens of accounts for allegedly spreading disinformation – a request Musk has denounced as censorship.</p><p>President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGkKcMNNS0U&amp;t=3s" data-link-name="in body link">said in a radio interview</a> on Friday morning: “Just because the guy [Musk] has a lot of money, doesn’t mean they can disrespect you … Who does he think he is?”</p><p>X, formerly known as Twitter, has been without a legal representative in Brazil since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/17/elon-musk-x-brazil" data-link-name="in body link">17 August</a>, when Musk announced that his company was shutting down its operations in the country “effective immediately” due to what it called “censorship orders” from Moraes. The service has remained available to users in the country.</p><p>Moraes’ April order to X to block some accounts stemmed from an investigation into “digital militias” who backed former president Jair Bolsonaro’s attempts to stay in power after his 2022 election defeat. After Musk <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/08/elon-musk-brazil-x-jair-bolsonaro" data-link-name="in body link">refused to comply</a>, the judge included him in his investigation.</p><p>On Wednesday, Moraes gave the company 24 hours to appoint a new legal representative in Brazil – a requirement for foreign companies operating in the country – “under penalty of immediate suspension of the social network’s activities”.</p><p>In the post announcing its non-compliance with the order, X said it “would not comply with his [Moraes’] illegal orders to censor his political opponents”.</p><p>Asked on Friday about Musk’s refusal to comply, Lula said: “Any and all citizens from anywhere in the world who have investments in Brazil are subject to the Brazilian constitution and Brazilian laws.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-15">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-15" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>The president said Musk “must respect the decision of the Brazilian supreme court … If not, this country will never be sovereign”.</p><p>It was also revealed on Thursday that on 18 August – a day after Musk announced the end of X’s operations in Brazil – Moraes <a href="https://twitter.com/Starlink/status/1829253524842303678" data-link-name="in body link">blocked the local bank accounts</a> for Musk’s satellite and internet provider Starlink. The aim was to enforce fines imposed on X <strong>–</strong> as of this Friday, R$18.3m (£2.5m) – for refusing to remove profiles accused of promoting anti-democratic acts and false news.</p><p>The two firms are part of Musk’s sprawling business empire, which includes the rocket company SpaceX and the electric car company Tesla. The billionaire owns X and 40% of SpaceX and is the chief executive of Tesla.</p><p>Legal experts have <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2024/08/decisoes-de-moraes-contra-x-e-starlink-de-musk-sao-vistas-com-restricoes.shtml" data-link-name="in body link">criticised the Starlink decision</a>. They argue that it is a different company (albeit one owned by the same person) and should not be held responsible for matters pertaining to X.</p><p>In an email to its clients, Starlink criticised the decision and stated: “Although this illegal request may affect our ability to receive your monthly payment … we will continue to provide services to you free of charge, if necessary.”</p><p>Starlink, which is the dominant internet provider in the Amazon, remains operational for now.</p><p>On Friday, Starlink filed a request with the supreme court to have Moraes’ decision suspended and its bank accounts unfrozen, or, if this request was denied, that the freeze be limited to the total of the fines against X. There is no indication as to when the request will be reviewed.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The cybersecurity expert, Connor Goodwolf, has spoken with 10TV and other media outlets in the last few weeks detailing what information is on the dark web.</p><div>
                    <p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — A Franklin County judge granted a temporary restraining order against the <a href="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/columbus-undercover-police-information-on-dark-web/530-d806b92a-ff1d-435a-9eac-1f88076878aa" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/columbus-undercover-police-information-on-dark-web/530-d806b92a-ff1d-435a-9eac-1f88076878aa" target="_blank">cybersecurity</a> expert who revealed what kind of information and how much of it was taken during a cyberattack on the city last month.</p>
                    <p>The cybersecurity expert, Connor Goodwolf, has spoken with 10TV and other media outlets in the last few weeks detailing what information is on the dark web. Goodwolf is the name he uses for interviews and is not his legal name.</p>
                        
                    <p>The city says it first learned something was wrong on July 18 when the city's department of technology "found evidence of an abnormality in its system." The city then severed its connection to the internet.</p>
                    <p>Two weeks later, the hacker group Rhysida claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it had 6.5 terabytes of data. The group later released 45% of the data it took from the city.</p>
                    
                    <p>On Aug. 13, Mayor Andrew Ginther said the data stolen by hackers was either corrupted or encrypted, meaning it was likely useless. Hours later, <a href="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/cybersecurity-expert-personal-data-of-over-400000-private-citizens-is-dark-web/530-5e74cf74-a8f9-42d9-8407-317b042b6f19" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/cybersecurity-expert-personal-data-of-over-400000-private-citizens-is-dark-web/530-5e74cf74-a8f9-42d9-8407-317b042b6f19" target="_blank">Goodwolf told 10TV</a> that wasn't true and he showed what kind of personal information he was able to access.</p>
                    <p>Goodwolf continued to speak with 10TV about what data from the city was posted<em>&nbsp;</em>on the dark web, most recently revealing that the Columbus police crime matrix is downloadable. That database includes witness, victim and suspect information from any police report in the last 10 years. It also shows undercover police reports.</p>
                    <p>The city filed for the temporary restraining order against Goodwolf Thursday morning and it was granted later in the day. The city is seeking at least $25,000 in damages. The total amount will be determined at a trial.</p>
                    <p>By granting the temporary restraining order, the court is ordering Goodwolf to stop accessing, downloading and disseminating the city's stolen data.</p>
                    <p>In the lawsuit, the city claims Goodwolf has caused "irreparable harm" and "widespread concern throughout the Central Ohio region."</p>
                    <p>During a press conference on Thursday, City Attorney Zach Klein said this is not about suppressing Goodwolf's First Amendment right.</p>
                                <div>
                                    <p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hUtI9w7u9lk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></p>
                                </div>
                    <p>"This is not about speech. It's not. It's about the actual action of going on the keyboard, going into the dark web, gathering the information, downloading it to your computer and then disseminating it to people who are in the press or otherwise," Klein said.</p>
                                
                    <p>When Klein was asked if the city is filing the temporary restraining order now to prevent more embarrassment, he said that is not the case.</p>
                    <p>"This is two and a half weeks into Connor being out there. If this was really about some sort of embarrassment, wouldn't we have filed it two and a half weeks ago? This is about the escalation of the type of data that threatens criminal investigations," Klein said.</p>
                    <p>Klein said he is working to protect officers, victims and witnesses. He adds that the information that Goodwolf has downloaded and shared is a threat to public safety.</p>
                    <p>"I am not going to let our officers down. I am not going to let our victims down. I am not going to let our witnesses down who are out there. Some witnesses are in tough cases. They put their ass on the line to go to court. They have the right to have their identity protected," Klein said.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the city says Goodwolf is threatening to publicly share the city's stolen data in the form of a website that he will create himself. Goodwolf previously told 10TV he does plan to set up a website, but it would only allow people to see if their name was part of the data breach.</p>
                    <p>Klein's office sent a release saying it respects the judge's decision to side with the city.</p>
                    <p>"This decision is a positive step to stem the dissemination of stolen confidential personnel and victim data—information that compromises active investigations and poses a threat to the lives and livelihoods of real people," Klein said.</p>
                    <p>The city filed four claims for relief against Goodwolf:</p>
                    <div>
<ul><li>Damages for criminal acts</li><li>Invasion of privacy</li><li>Negligence</li><li>Civil conversion</li></ul>                    </div>
                    <p>Franklin County Common Pleas Court records show a final pretrial conference is scheduled for Sept. 18, 2025.</p>
                    <p>10TV reached out to Goodwolf for comment, but he declined.</p>
                                <div>
                                    <p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q8oecRcBTRc?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>It is with great sadness that I find myself penning the hardest news post I’ve ever needed to write here at AnandTech. After over 27 years of covering the wide – and wild – word of computing hardware, today is AnandTech’s final day of publication.</p>

<p>For better or worse, we’ve reached the end of a long journey – one that started with a <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/42/amd-k6-review">review of an AMD processor</a>, and has ended with the <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21524/the-amd-ryzen-9-9950x-and-ryzen-9-9900x-review">review of an AMD processor</a>. It’s fittingly poetic, but it is also a testament to the fact that we’ve spent the last 27 years doing what we love, covering the chips that are the lifeblood of the computing industry.</p>

<p>A lot of things have changed in the last quarter-century – in 1997 NVIDIA had yet to even coin the term “GPU” – and we’ve been fortunate to watch the world of hardware continue to evolve over the time period. We’ve gone from boxy desktop computers and laptops that today we’d charitably classify as portable desktops, to pocket computers where even the cheapest budget device puts the fastest PC of 1997 to shame.</p>

<p>The years have also brought some monumental changes to the world of publishing. AnandTech was hardly the first hardware enthusiast website, nor will we be the last. But we were fortunate to thrive in the past couple of decades, when so many of our peers did not, thanks to a combination of hard work, strategic investments in people and products, even more hard work, and the support of our many friends, colleagues, and readers.</p>

<p>Still, few things last forever, and the market for written tech journalism is not what it once was – nor will it ever be again. So, the time has come for AnandTech to wrap up its work, and let the next generation of tech journalists take their place within the zeitgeist.</p>

<p>It has been my immense privilege to write for AnandTech for the past 19 years – and to manage it as its editor-in-chief for the past decade. And while I carry more than a bit of remorse in being AnandTech’s final boss, I can at least take pride in everything we’ve accomplished over the years, whether it’s <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/10325/the-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1080-and-1070-founders-edition-review">lauding some legendary products</a>, writing <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/2829">technology primers that still remain relevant today</a>, or watching <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/6330/the-iphone-5-review/4">new stars rise in expected places</a>. There is still more that I had wanted AnandTech to do, but after 21,500 articles, this was a good start.</p>

<p>And while the AnandTech staff is riding off into the sunset, I am happy to report that the site itself won’t be going anywhere for a while. Our publisher, Future PLC, will be keeping the AnandTech website and its many articles live indefinitely. So that all of the content we’ve created over the years remains accessible and citable. Even without new articles to add to the collection, I expect that many of the things we’ve written over the past couple of decades will remain relevant for years to come – and remain accessible just as long.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://forums.anandtech.com/">AnandTech Forums</a> will also continue to be operated by Future’s community team and our dedicated troop of moderators. With forum threads going back to 1999 (and some active members just as long), the forums have a history almost as long and as storied as AnandTech itself (wounded monitor children, anyone?). So even when AnandTech is no longer publishing articles, we’ll still have a place for everyone to talk about the latest in technology – and have those discussions last longer than 48 hours.</p>

<p><a href="https://forums.anandtech.com/" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21542/AT_Forums.png"></a></p>

<p>Finally, for everyone who still needs their technical writing fix, our formidable opposition of the last 27 years and fellow Future brand, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/">Tom’s Hardware</a>, is continuing to cover the world of technology. There are a couple of familiar AnandTech faces already over there providing their accumulated expertise, and the site will continue doing its best to provide a written take on technology news.</p>

<h3>So Many Thank Yous</h3>

<p>As I look back on everything AnandTech has accomplished over the past 27 years, there are more than a few people, groups, and companies that I would like to thank on behalf of both myself and AnandTech as a whole.</p>

<p>First and foremost, I cannot thank enough all the editors who have worked for AnandTech over the years. There are far more of you than I can ever name, but AnandTech’s editors have been the lifeblood of the site, bringing over their expertise and passion to craft the kind of deep, investigative articles that AnandTech is best known for. These are the finest people I’ve ever had the opportunity to work with, and it shouldn’t come as any surprise that these people have become even bigger successes in their respective fields. Whether it’s hardware and software development, consulting and business analysis, or even launching rockets into space, they’ve all been rock stars whom I’ve been fortunate to work with over the past couple of decades.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21542/Ian_Anton_Gavin.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21542/Ian_Anton_Gavin_575px.jpg"></a><br>
<small><em>Ian Cutress, Anton Shilov, and Gavin Bonshor at Computex 2019</em></small></p>

<p>And a special shout out to the final class of AnandTech editors, who have been with us until the end, providing the final articles that grace this site. Gavin Bonshor, Ganesh TS, E. Fylladitakis, and Anton Shilov have all gone above and beyond to meet impossible deadlines and go half-way around the world to report on the latest in technology.</p>

<p>Of course, none of this would have been possible without the man himself, Anand Lal Shimpi, who started this site out of his bedroom 27 years ago. While Anand retired from the world of tech journalism a decade ago, the standard he set for quality and the lessons he taught all of us have continued to resonate within AnandTech to this very day. And while it would be tautological to say that there would be no AnandTech without Anand, it’s none the less true – the mark on the tech publishing industry that we’ve been able to make all started with him.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21542/2014-02-26%20MWC.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21542/2014-02-26%20MWC_575px.jpg"></a><br>
<small><em>MWC 2014: Ian Cutress, Anand Lal Shimpi, Joshua Ho</em></small></p>

<p>I also want to thank the many, many hardware and software companies we’ve worked with over the years. More than just providing us review samples and technical support, we’ve been given unique access to some of the greatest engineers in the industry. People who have built some of the most complex chips ever made, and casually forgotten more about the subject than we as tech journalists will ever know. So being able to ask those minds stupid questions, and seeing the gears turn in their heads as they explain their ideas, innovations, and thought processes has been nothing short of an incredible learning experience. We haven’t always (or even often) seen eye-to-eye on matters with all of the companies we've covered, but as the last 27 years have shown, sharing the amazing advancements behind the latest technologies has benefited everyone, consumers and companies alike.</p>

<p>Thank yous are also due to AnandTech’s publishers over the years – Future PLC, and Purch before them. AnandTech’s publishers have given us an incredible degree of latitude to do things the AnandTech way, even when it meant taking big risks or not following the latest trend. &nbsp;A more cynical and controlling publisher could have undoubtedly found ways to make more money from the AnandTech website, but the resulting content would not have been AnandTech. We’ve enjoyed complete editorial freedom up to our final day, and that’s not something so many other websites have had the luxury to experience. And for that I am thankful.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21542/CES_2016_AT_Editors.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21542/CES_2016_AT_Editors_575px.jpg"></a><br>
<small><em>CES 2016: Ian Cutress, Ganesh TS, Joshua Ho, Brett Howse, Brandon Chester, Billy Tallis</em></small></p>

<p>Finally, I cannot thank our many readers enough. Whether you’ve been following AnandTech since 1997 or you’ve just recently discovered us, everything we’ve published here we’ve done for you. To show you what amazing things were going on in the world of technology, the radical innovations driving the next generation of products, or a sober review that reminds us all that there’s (almost) no such thing as bad products, just bad pricing. Our readers have kept us on our toes, pushing us to do better, and <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/3988/the-use-of-evgas-geforce-gtx-460-ftw-in-last-nights-review">holding us responsible when we’ve strayed from our responsibilities</a>.</p>

<p>Ultimately, a website is only as influential as its readers, otherwise we would be screaming into the void that is the Internet. For all the credit we can claim as writers, all of that pales in comparison to our readers who have enjoyed our content, referenced it, and shared it with the world. So from the bottom of my heart, thank you for sticking with us for the past 27 years.</p>

<h3>Continuing the Fight Against the Cable TV-ification of the Web</h3>

<p>Finally, I’d like to end this piece with a comment on the Cable TV-ification of the web. A core belief that Anand and I have held dear for years, and is still on our <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/home/about/">About page</a> to this day, is AnandTech’s rebuke of sensationalism, link baiting, and the path to shallow 10-o'clock-news reporting. It has been our mission over the past 27 years to inform and educate our readers by providing high-quality content – and while we’re no longer going to be able to fulfill that role, the need for quality, in-depth reporting has not changed. If anything, the need has increased as social media and changing advertising landscapes have made shallow, sensationalistic reporting all the more lucrative.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21542/Anand_AGN_June_1998.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21542/Anand_AGN_June_1998.jpg"></a><br>
<small><em>Speaking of TV: Anand Hosting The AGN Hardware Show (June 1998)</em></small></p>

<p>For all the tech journalists out there right now – or tech journalists to be – I implore you to remain true to yourself, and to your readers' needs. In-depth reporting isn’t always as sexy or as exciting as other avenues, but now, more than ever, it’s necessary to counter sensationalism and cynicism with high-quality reporting and testing that is used to support thoughtful conclusions. To quote Anand: “I don't believe the web needs to be academic reporting or sensationalist garbage - as long as there's a balance, I'm happy.”</p>

<h3>Signing Off One Last Time</h3>

<p>Wrapping things up, it has been my privilege over the last 19 years to write for one of the most impactful tech news websites that has ever existed. And while I’m heartbroken that we’re at the end of AnandTech’s 27-year journey, I can take solace in everything we’ve been able to accomplish over the years. All of which has been made possible thanks to our industry partners and our awesome readers.</p>

<p>On a personal note, this has been my dream job; to say I’ve been fortunate would be an understatement. And while I’ll no longer be the editor-in-chief of AnandTech, I’m far from being done with technology as a whole. I’ll still be around on <a href="https://x.com/RyanSmithAT">Twitter/X</a>, and we’ll see where my own journey takes me next.</p>



<p>To everyone who has followed AnandTech over the years, fans, foes, readers, competitors, academics, engineers, and just the technologically curious who want to learn a bit more about their favorite hardware, thank you for all of your patronage over the years. We could not have accomplished this without your support.</p>

<p>-Thanks,<br>
Ryan Smith</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The National Library is in the process of a major overhaul of its 2007 bit-repository, replacing it with a contemporary digital preservation system. This new solution is based on an in-house developed system called DPS (Digital Preservation Services), which uses IBM-HPSS as the underlying bit repository for data storage. This transition, which is expected to span over a couple of years, is necessary to ensure the long-term preservation and accessibility of the National Library’s digital collection.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://digitalpreservation-blog.nb.no/blog/2024-08-28-rearchiving-2-million-hours-of-digital-radio/retro-4601416_1280.webp" alt="Old radio"></p><h2 id="transition-to-a-new-preservation-solution">Transition to a New Preservation Solution</h2><p>In 2023, all new data archiving was transferred to the new DPS preservation solution. At this time, the old bit repository contained over 14 Petabytes of digitized and legally deposited historical material, which needs to be re-archived into DPS. A key part of this process involves analyzing and repackaging the historical data to meet the new DPS requirements.</p><h2 id="historical-legally-deposited-radio">Historical Legally Deposited Radio</h2><p>Among the materials to be re-archived are 2.2 million hours of digital radio, equivalent to 2.5 million files and a total of 1 Petabyte of data. This includes both born-digital and digitized radio programs from the period 1993-2022.</p><p>In 1993, there were four radio channels delivering 16,500 hours of radio. By 2022, the number of radio channels had increased to 30, collectively delivering 150,000 hours of radio. With the phasing out of the old bit repository, it became necessary to move this data to the new preservation solution.</p><h2 id="dsm-to-dps-a-thorough-process">DSM to DPS: A Thorough Process</h2><p>DSM (Digital Longterm Storage) has been the National Library’s internal management system for legally deposited radio for the past 20 years. The data has been stored in an Oracle HSM bit-repository in three instances (disk, tape, tape), and the radio material was fetched daily from various broadcasters. Some radio broadcasts were stored as mp3 and wav files, with accompanying checksum files. Other broadcasts were only stored as mp3.</p><p>Before the re-archiving process began, it was decided to generate new MP4 playback files from the wav files to replace the varying qualities of the old mp3 files. The new MP4 files is not to be archived in DPS, as they are secured on the Wowza viewing platform. The new MP4 playback format chosen was 160kbit AAC with the M4A (audio) container. Fraunhofer FDK AAC (libfdk_aac) was used as the codec.</p><p>All objects were packaged according to the <a href="https://earkaip.dilcis.eu/">E-ARK standard</a>, and metadata was generated in MODS format. File identification was performed using the tool Siegfried, and technical metadata is extracted using <a href="https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo">Mediainfo</a>. Each file was carefully processed and documented, and “events” were created to record what had been done. These were stored in the DPS database.</p><h2 id="timeline-and-experience">Timeline and Experience</h2><p>Preliminary studies and mapping began in the fall of 2023, and the development of the re-archiving workflow, based on Apache NiFi, started in December 2023. The first version was put into operation on February 27, 2024, and by June 24, 2024, the re-archiving of 2.2 million radio programs was completed.</p><p>The generation of new MP4 files was time-consuming, but an infrastructure running 35 parallel threads made it possible to achieve a re-archiving rate of 9 Terabytes per day.</p><h2 id="findings-and-lessons-learned">Findings and Lessons Learned</h2><p>During the process, discrepancies were found in 577 out of 2.2 million objects. None of the errors occurred while the data was stored in the Oracle HSM bit repository. Most errors are related to inadequate control routines when the material was first received and archived.</p><h3 id="checksum-mismatch-4-cases">Checksum mismatch (4 cases)</h3><ul><li><strong>Cause:</strong> Objects failed due to a checksum mismatch, where the recorded checksum and the actual calculated checksum during re-archiving differed.</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> For each of these objects, all three copies in Oracle HSM (disk, tape, tape) were checked and found to be identical. This means the discrepancy between the actual checksum and the recorded checksum must have occurred before the object was first archived. For these four objects, we chose to include the mp3 file in the preserved object, as it had the correct checksum. Additionally, an “event” was recorded describing why we also preserved the mp3 file.</li></ul><h3 id="null-byte-file-1-case">Null-byte file (1 case)</h3><ul><li><strong>Cause:</strong> An object where the wav file was null byte, causing a checksum mismatch.</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> We checked all three copies in Oracle HSM and found they were identical. The discrepancy between the actual checksum and the recorded checksum must have occurred before the object was stored in Oracle HSM. For this object, we chose to include the mp3 file in the preserved object, as it had content and the correct checksum. An “event” was also recorded to explain why the mp3 file was preserved.</li></ul><h3 id="corrupt-file-1-case">Corrupt file (1 case)</h3><ul><li><strong>Cause:</strong> A file with the correct checksum that failed because we couldn’t extract “duration” from Mediainfo, revealing that the file was corrupt.</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> We chose to archive the corrupt file in the absence of alternatives and recorded an “event” describing our findings.</li></ul><h3 id="urn-validation-failed-507-cases">URN validation failed (507 cases)</h3><ul><li><strong>Cause:</strong> Objects with a URN that was not in the expected format. The URN validator extracts data from the URN and uses it to build MODS metadata for the object to be archived. In this case, the validator indicated that the URN content did not match what it expected. The discrepancy appears to be due to file delivery errors related to a broadcaster for a short period in October 2011.</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> URNs were changed to the correct format.</li></ul><h3 id="duplicate-files-48-cases">Duplicate files (48 cases)</h3><ul><li><strong>Cause:</strong> During the re-archiving process, it was discovered that 48 objects from DSM were already archived in DPS. This is related to the transition of radio production workflows on March 21, 2023. At that time, daily legal deposit of radio was moved from DSM to the new DPS. In this process, the first datasets were manually loaded into the new DPS to ensure the transition was correct. By mistake, they were also captured by the old production workflow and archived in DSM. The data from the transition day was therefore stored in both the new DPS and the old DSM. When we started re-archiving the radio, we encountered duplicate errors for the programs from that day since they were already archived in DPS.</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> No action was needed as the data is correctly archived in DPS.</li></ul><h3 id="duplicate-files-16-cases">Duplicate files (16 cases)</h3><ul><li><strong>Cause:</strong> After re-archiving was completed, there were 16 objects that, for various reasons, remained in the queue marked as not archived but were actually archived in DPS. These are mostly related to a cleanup after a backup-related incident on March 1, 2024.</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> No action was needed as the data is correctly archived in DPS.</li></ul><h2 id="statistics-and-results">Statistics and Results</h2><p>The re-archiving process resulted in 2.1 million new MP4 files, totalling 143 TB of new playback files on nb.no, replacing 40 TB of the old MP3 files. In total, 2,183,478 archive packages were re-archived in the new DPS preservation environment.</p><p>This work represents a significant improvement in the National Library’s ability to preserve and make available digital radio material for future generations.</p><h2 id="some-numbers">Some numbers</h2><p><strong>Statistics from DSM (old preservation environment)</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>MimeType</th><th>Quantity</th><th>Bytes</th><th>TiB</th><th>TB</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>audio/mpeg</td><td>24 997</td><td>1 436 936 706 369</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>audio/x-wav</td><td>2 158 485</td><td>1 053 241 022 424 650</td><td>958</td><td>1 053</td></tr><tr><td>text/plain</td><td>358 462</td><td>12 177 323</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Statistics from DPS (new preservation environment)</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Num AIPs</th><th>Bytes</th><th>TiB</th><th>TB</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>radio-DK</td><td>350 929</td><td>47 733 509 049 163</td><td>43</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>radio</td><td>1 832 549</td><td>1 007 674 770 422 690</td><td>916</td><td>1 007</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>2 183 478</td><td>1 055 408 279 471 850</td><td>959</td><td>1 055</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>TiB (TebiByte) is bytes/1024 which is the exact unit of measurement for data volume.</em></p><p><em>TB(TeraByte) is bytes/1000 which is the most commonly used unit of measurement for approximate data volume.</em></p><p>2.1 million new MP4 (M4a) files were produced, which together amounted to 130TiB/143TB with new access files on nb.no.

<h2><span>Rust</span>’<span>s Ugly Syntax</span> <time datetime="2023-01-26">Jan 26, 2023</time></h2>
<p><span>People complain about Rust syntax.</span>
<span>I think that most of the time when people think they have an issue with Rust</span>’<span>s syntax, they actually object to Rust</span>’<span>s semantics.</span>
<span>In this slightly whimsical post, I</span>’<span>ll try to disentangle the two.</span></p>
<p><span>Let</span>’<span>s start with an example of an ugly Rust syntax:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read</span>&lt;P: <span>AsRef</span>&lt;Path&gt;&gt;(path: P) <span>-&gt;</span> io::<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Vec</span>&lt;<span>u8</span>&gt;&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>fn</span> <span>inner</span>(path: &amp;Path) <span>-&gt;</span> io::<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Vec</span>&lt;<span>u8</span>&gt;&gt; {</span>
<span>    <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>file</span> = File::<span>open</span>(path)?;</span>
<span>    <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>bytes</span> = <span>Vec</span>::<span>new</span>();</span>
<span>    file.<span>read_to_end</span>(&amp;<span>mut</span> bytes)?;</span>
<span>    <span>Ok</span>(bytes)</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>  <span>inner</span>(path.<span>as_ref</span>())</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>This function reads contents of a given binary file.</span>
<span>This is lifted straight from the standard library, so it is very much not a strawman example.</span>
<span>And, at least to me, it</span>’<span>s definitely not a pretty one!</span></p>
<p><span>Let</span>’<span>s try to imagine what this same function would look like if Rust had a better syntax.</span>
<span>Any resemblance to real programming languages, living or dead, is purely coincidental!</span></p>
<p><span>Let</span>’<span>s start with Rs++:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>template</span>&lt;std::HasConstReference&lt;std::Path&gt; P&gt;</span>
<span>std::io::outcome&lt;std::vector&lt;<span>uint8_t</span>&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>std::<span>read</span>(P path) {</span>
<span>    <span>return</span> <span>read_</span>(path.<span>as_reference</span>());</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>static</span></span>
<span>std::io::outcome&lt;std::vector&lt;<span>uint8_t</span>&gt;&gt;</span>
<span><span>read_</span>(&amp;<span>auto</span> <span>const</span> std::Path path) {</span>
<span>    <span>auto</span> file = <span>try</span> std::File::<span>open</span>(path);</span>
<span>    std::vector bytes;</span>
<span>    <span>try</span> file.<span>read_to_end</span>(&amp;bytes);</span>
<span>    <span>return</span> <span>okey</span>(bytes);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>A Rhodes variant:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>public</span> io.Result&lt;ArrayList&lt;Byte&gt;&gt; read&lt;P <span>extends</span> <span>ReferencingFinal</span>&lt;Path&gt;&gt;(</span>
<span>        P path) {</span>
<span>    <span>return</span> myRead(path.get_final_reference());</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>private</span> io.Result&lt;ArrayList&lt;Byte&gt;&gt; <span>myRead</span><span>(</span></span>
<span><span>        <span>final</span> reference lifetime <span>var</span> Path path)</span> {</span>
<span>    <span>var</span> <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>try</span> File.open(path);</span>
<span>    ArrayList&lt;Byte&gt; bytes = ArrayList.new();</span>
<span>    <span>try</span> file.readToEnd(borrow bytes);</span>
<span>    <span>return</span> Success(bytes);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Typical RhodesScript:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span>public <span>function</span> read&lt;P <span>extends</span> <span>IncludingRef</span>&lt;<span>Path</span>&gt;&gt;(</span>
<span>    <span>path</span>: P,</span>
<span>): io.<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Array</span>&lt;byte&gt;&gt; {</span>
<span>    <span>return</span> <span>myRead</span>(path.<span>included_ref</span>());</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span>private <span>function</span> <span>myRead</span>(<span></span></span>
<span><span>    path: &amp;<span>const</span> Path,</span></span>
<span><span></span>): io.<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Array</span>&lt;byte&gt;&gt; {</span>
<span>    <span>let</span> file = <span>try</span> <span>File</span>.<span>open</span>(path);</span>
<span>    <span>Array</span>&lt;byte&gt; bytes = <span>Array</span>.<span>new</span>()</span>
<span>    <span>try</span> file.<span>readToEnd</span>(&amp;bytes)</span>
<span>    <span>return</span> <span>Ok</span>(bytes);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Rattlesnake:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>read</span>[P: Refing[Path]](path: P): io.Result[<span>List</span>[byte]]:</span>
<span>    <span>def</span> <span>inner</span>(<span>path: @Path</span>): io.Result[<span>List</span>[byte]]:</span>
<span>        file := <span>try</span> File.<span>open</span>(path)</span>
<span>        <span>bytes</span> := <span>List</span>.new()</span>
<span>        <span>try</span> file.read_to_end(@: <span>bytes</span>)</span>
<span>        <span>return</span> Ok(<span>bytes</span>)</span>
<span>    <span>return</span> inner(path.ref)</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>And, to conclude, CrabML:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span>read :: 'p  ref_of =&gt; 'p -&gt; u8 vec io.either.t</span>
<span>let read p =</span>

</figure>
<p><span>As a slightly more serious and useful exercise, let</span>’<span>s do the opposite </span>—<span> keep the Rust syntax, but try to simplify semantics until the end result looks presentable.</span></p>
<p><span>Here</span>’<span>s our starting point:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read</span>&lt;P: <span>AsRef</span>&lt;Path&gt;&gt;(path: P) <span>-&gt;</span> io::<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Vec</span>&lt;<span>u8</span>&gt;&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>fn</span> <span>inner</span>(path: &amp;Path) <span>-&gt;</span> io::<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Vec</span>&lt;<span>u8</span>&gt;&gt; {</span>
<span>    <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>file</span> = File::<span>open</span>(path)?;</span>
<span>    <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>bytes</span> = <span>Vec</span>::<span>new</span>();</span>
<span>    file.<span>read_to_end</span>(&amp;<span>mut</span> bytes)?;</span>
<span>    <span>Ok</span>(bytes)</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>  <span>inner</span>(path.<span>as_ref</span>())</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>The biggest source of noise here is the nested function.</span>
<span>The motivation for it is somewhat esoteric.</span>
<span>The outer function is generic, while the inner function isn</span>’<span>t.</span>
<span>With the current compilation model, that means that the outer function is compiled together with the user</span>’<span>s code, gets inlined and is optimized down to nothing.</span>
<span>In contrast, the inner function is compiled when the std itself is being compiled, saving time when compiling user</span>’<span>s code.</span>
<span>One way to simplify this (losing a bit of performance) is to say that generic functions are always separately compiled, but accept an extra runtime argument under the hood which describes the physical dimension of input parameters.</span></p>
<p><span>With that, we get</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read</span>&lt;P: <span>AsRef</span>&lt;Path&gt;&gt;(path: P) <span>-&gt;</span> io::<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Vec</span>&lt;<span>u8</span>&gt;&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>file</span> = File::<span>open</span>(path.<span>as_ref</span>())?;</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>bytes</span> = <span>Vec</span>::<span>new</span>();</span>
<span>  file.<span>read_to_end</span>(&amp;<span>mut</span> bytes)?;</span>
<span>  <span>Ok</span>(bytes)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>The next noisy element is the </span><code>&lt;P: AsRef&lt;Path&gt;&gt;</code><span> constraint.</span>
<span>It is needed because Rust loves exposing physical layout of bytes in memory as an interface, specifically for cases where that brings performance.</span>
<span>In particular, the meaning of </span><code>Path</code><span> is not that it is some abstract representation of a file path, but that it is just literally a bunch of contiguous bytes in memory.</span>
<span>So we need </span><code>AsRef</code><span> to make this work with </span><em><span>any</span></em><span> abstraction which is capable of representing such a slice of bytes.</span>
<span>But if we don</span>’<span>t care about performance, we can require that all interfaces are fairly abstract and mediated via virtual function calls, rather than direct memory access.</span>
<span>Then we won</span>’<span>t need </span><code>AsRef</code><span>at all:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read</span>(path: &amp;Path) <span>-&gt;</span> io::<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Vec</span>&lt;<span>u8</span>&gt;&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>file</span> = File::<span>open</span>(path)?;</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>bytes</span> = <span>Vec</span>::<span>new</span>();</span>
<span>  file.<span>read_to_end</span>(&amp;<span>mut</span> bytes)?;</span>
<span>  <span>Ok</span>(bytes)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Having done this, we can actually get rid of </span><code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code><span> as well </span>—<span> we can no longer use generics to express efficient growable array of bytes in the language itself.</span>
<span>We</span>’<span>d have to use some opaque </span><code>Bytes</code><span> type provided by the runtime:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read</span>(path: &amp;Path) <span>-&gt;</span> io::<span>Result</span>&lt;Bytes&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>file</span> = File::<span>open</span>(path)?;</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>bytes</span> = Bytes::<span>new</span>();</span>
<span>  file.<span>read_to_end</span>(&amp;<span>mut</span> bytes)?;</span>
<span>  <span>Ok</span>(bytes)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Technically, we are still carrying ownership and borrowing system with us, but, without direct control over memory layout of types, it no longer brings massive performance benefits.</span>
<span>It still helps to avoid GC, prevent iterator invalidation, and statically check that non-thread-safe code isn</span>’<span>t actually used across threads.</span>
<span>Still, we can easily get rid of those &amp;-pretzels if we just switch to GC.</span>
<span>We don</span>’<span>t even need to worry about concurrency much </span>—<span> as our objects are separately allocated and always behind a pointer, we can hand-wave data races away by noticing that operations with pointer-sized things are atomic on x86 anyway.</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read</span>(path: Path) <span>-&gt;</span> io::<span>Result</span>&lt;Bytes&gt; {</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>file</span> = File::<span>open</span>(path)?;</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>bytes</span> = Bytes::<span>new</span>();</span>
<span>  file.<span>read_to_end</span>(bytes)?;</span>
<span>  <span>Ok</span>(bytes)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Finally, we are being overly pedantic with error handling here </span>—<span> not only we mention a possibility of failure in the return type, we even use </span><code>?</code><span> to highlight any specific expression that might fail.</span>
<span>It would be much simpler to not think about error handling at all, and let some top-level</span><br>
<code>try { } catch (...) { /* intentionally empty */ }</code><br>
<span>handler deal with it:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read</span>(path: Path) <span>-&gt;</span> Bytes {</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>file</span> = File::<span>open</span>(path);</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>bytes</span> = Bytes::<span>new</span>();</span>
<span>  file.<span>read_to_end</span>(bytes);</span>
<span>  bytes</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><strong><strong><span>Much</span></strong></strong><span> better now!</span></p>
