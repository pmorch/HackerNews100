<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="file-jq-md" tabindex="0" role="region" aria-label="jq.md content, created on 11:54PM yesterday.">
    <article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">TL;DR</h2><a id="user-content-tldr" aria-label="Permalink: TL;DR" href="#tldr"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can take the same source code package that Ubuntu uses to build <a href="https://github.com/jqlang/jq">jq</a>, compile it again, and realize 90% better performance.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">Setting</h2><a id="user-content-setting" aria-label="Permalink: Setting" href="#setting"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I use <code>jq</code> for processing GeoJSON files and other open data offered in JSON format. Today I am working with a 500MB GeoJSON file that contains the Alameda County Assessor's parcel map. I want to run a query that prints the city for every parcel worth more than a threshold amount. The program is</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>.features[] | select(.properties.TotalNetValue &lt; 193000) | .properties.SitusCity</code></p>
<p dir="auto">This takes about 5 seconds with the file cached, on a Ryzen 9 9950X system. That seems a bit shabby and I am sure we can do better.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">Step 1:  Just rebuild the package</h2><a id="user-content-step-1--just-rebuild-the-package" aria-label="Permalink: Step 1:  Just rebuild the package" href="#step-1--just-rebuild-the-package"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">What happens if you grab the <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+sourcefiles/jq/1.7.1-3build1/jq_1.7.1.orig.tar.gz" rel="nofollow">jq source code from Launchpad</a>, then configure and rebuild it with no flags at all?

<p dir="auto">Jq is a complex C program, and C programs of any complexity tend to rely on malloc and free, because the language offers no other cognizable way to deal with memory. Allocation is the top line in the profile by far. What if we use a better allocator, instead of the one that comes in GNU libc? Ubuntu offers a package of TCMalloc, which is actually rather obsolete and not the current TCMalloc effort, but it's an allocator package in their repo, so let's give it a whirl.</p>

<p dir="auto">NVIDIA Dynamo is a high-throughput low-latency inference framework designed for serving generative AI and reasoning models in multi-node distributed environments. Dynamo is designed to be inference engine agnostic (supports TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang or others) and captures LLM-specific capabilities such as:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Disaggregated prefill &amp; decode inference</strong> – Maximizes GPU throughput and facilitates trade off between throughput and latency.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic GPU scheduling</strong> – Optimizes performance based on fluctuating demand</li>
<li><strong>LLM-aware request routing</strong> – Eliminates unnecessary KV cache re-computation</li>
<li><strong>Accelerated data transfer</strong> – Reduces inference response time using NIXL.</li>
<li><strong>KV cache offloading</strong> – Leverages multiple memory hierarchies for higher system throughput</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Built in Rust for performance and in Python for extensibility, Dynamo is fully open-source and driven by a transparent, OSS (Open Source Software) first development approach.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (<a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/doge/">DOGE</a>) has spent the first six weeks of the new Trump administration turning the federal government <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-digital-coup-doge-data-ai/">upside down</a>. It has moved from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-operatives-access-social-security-administration/">agency to agency</a>, accessing sensitive data and payment systems, all on a supposed crusade to audit the government and stop fraud, waste, and abuse. DOGE has posted some of its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doge-website-offers-error-filled-window-into-musks-government-overhaul-2025-03-04/">“findings” on its website</a>, many of which have been <a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/doge-errors-funding-grants-claims.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/doge-errors-funding-grants-claims.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/doge-errors-funding-grants-claims.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">revealed to be</a> errors.</p><p>But two federal auditors with years of experience, who have both worked on financial and technical audits for the government, say that DOGE’s actions are the furthest thing from what an actual audit looks like. Both asked to speak on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t permitted to speak to the press.</p><p>“Honestly, comparing real auditing to what DOGE is doing, there’s no comparison,” says one of the auditors who spoke to WIRED. “None of them are auditors.”</p><p>In September, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Rs572N9965E?t=2002s">speech</a> during the presidential campaign, then candidate Donald Trump said that he would create a government efficiency task force, headed by Musk, which would do a “complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government.” Musk initially said that he wanted to cut <a data-offer-url="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/29/elon-musk-2-trillion-budget-cuts-trump-election/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/29/elon-musk-2-trillion-budget-cuts-trump-election/&quot;}" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/29/elon-musk-2-trillion-budget-cuts-trump-election/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$2 trillion</a> from the federal budget, more than the entire 2023 discretionary budget of <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59727">$1.7 trillion</a>. Musk has since tempered his ambitions, saying he’d aim to cut $1 trillion in government spending. Still, he has alleged that much of this money can be cut by identifying waste, fraud, and abuse, and has continued to claim DOGE’s cuts of agency staff and resources are all part of an audit.</p><p>While there are certainly instances of government money siphoned off to fraud—<a data-offer-url="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105833" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105833&quot;}" href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105833" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a Government Accountability Office study</a> published in 2024 estimated that the government loses between $233 billion and $521 billion to fraud each year—even recovering all that spending wouldn’t amount to the $1 trillion Musk hopes to cut from the budget.</p><p>The auditors who spoke to WIRED allege that not only is Musk’s claim not true, but also that DOGE appears to have completely eschewed the existing processes for actually rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse.</p><p>“An audit that follows Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), also known as a Yellow Book audit, is conducted in accordance with the standards issued by the US Government Accountability Office,” says the first auditor. Audits can focus on the finances, compliance, or performance of an agency. “That is the gold standard for how you audit the government.”</p><p>There are generally five phases of a GAGAS audit, the auditors tell WIRED: planning, evidence gathering, evaluation, reporting, and follow up. Auditors work to define the scope of an audit, identify all the applicable laws and standards, and come up with an audit plan. Next, auditors conduct interviews with staff, review financial records, and comb through data, reports, and transactions, documenting all the way. From there, auditors will assess that information against policies or procedures to figure out if there’s been some kind of alleged waste, fraud, or abuse and issue a report detailing their findings and offering recommendations. Often, those reports are made <a href="https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2020-09/OIG-20-76-Sep20.pdf">available to the public</a>. After an audit, the auditors can follow up with the agency to ensure changes are being made.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>There are also very technical definitions for what constitutes waste, fraud, or abuse. Waste could mean that there are inefficiencies in a program that might lead to purchasing more of something that goes unused, or paying more for a service than is necessary. Fraud involves intentional deception—for instance, bribery or falsifying business records. Abuse means doing things that aren’t necessarily illegal, but that are unethical. This could look like nepotism or favoritism in hiring, or spending excessively on travel.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo">recent interview with podcaster Joe Rogan</a>, Musk said he believed that the government was “one big pyramid scheme” and alleged that “entitlements fraud” is a “gigantic magnetic force to pull people in from all around the world and keep them here.”</p><p>The two auditors told WIRED that going through the technological and financial minutiae of even just a single project or part of an agency can take anywhere from six to 18 months.</p><p>“You can’t coherently audit something like the whole Social Security system in a week or two,” says the second auditor. It’s exactly this rush to crack systems open without full understanding, the auditors say, that has led to Elon Musk’s false claims that <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-social-security-150-year-old-benefits/">150-year-olds were receiving Social Security benefits</a>. “It could be that DOGE didn’t de-dupe the data.”</p><p>“In no uncertain terms is this an audit,” claims the second auditor. “It’s a heist, stealing a vast amount of government data.”</p><p>Federal workers who have spoken to WIRED say <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/surveillance-privacy-doge-federal-employees/">they are worried that their own data</a> could be used to surveil and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/government-employees-lawsuit-privacy-doge/">target them</a> for firings based on their identities or political views. There are also concerns that DOGE could access contracts and procurement data that contain <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-elon-musk/">sensitive information</a> that companies provide in order to work with the federal government. DOGE has also <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gsai-chatbot-1500-federal-workers/">deployed an AI chatbot</a> within the General Services Administration (GSA) and appears to want to expand the use of such tools, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-federal-agencies-ai/">bolstered by access to government data</a>. New court documents also indicate that Marko Elez, the former DOGE representative at the Treasury Department, <a data-offer-url="https://www.yahoo.com/news/doge-staffer-broke-treasury-rules-200703996.html?guccounter=1" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/news/doge-staffer-broke-treasury-rules-200703996.html?guccounter=1&quot;}" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/doge-staffer-broke-treasury-rules-200703996.html?guccounter=1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">shared a spreadsheet</a> with personally identifying information outside the agency.</p><p>And without time spent for auditors to understand a new data system—like interviewing agency staff or learning the coding language—the first auditor believes it’s likely the DOGE team is flying blind. “When they collect a dataset, they don't get it with any sort of description, I imagine,” they say. “There are no terms of use for any government systems … There's no supporting testimony from data system owners, from data system experts. They don't even know the language and the database systems that they're working in. That’s why they keep messing up.”</p><p>The auditors described a lengthy vetting process that allowed them to get the permissions necessary to dive into an agency’s data and systems. In addition to going through the initial vetting process, the auditors say that they are required to engage in continuing education.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“None of them have any auditing background, none have any certifications, none have any clearances,” says the first auditor.</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/">Federal workers</a> who have spoken to WIRED expressed concern that DOGE’s operatives appear to have bypassed the normal security clearance protocols in order to access sensitive systems. WIRED found that many of DOGE’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/">youngest members</a>, all of whom were 25 or younger, have very limited work experience, and none in the government. One, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/edward-coristine-tesla-sexy-path-networks-doge/">Edward Coristine, who goes by “Big Balls” online</a>, appears to be a 19-year-old high school graduate. Despite this, they were given high-level access at places like the GSA, the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-operatives-access-social-security-administration/">Social Security Administration</a>, and the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-associate-bfs-federal-payment-system/">Treasury</a>. Others, like those at the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/faa-doge-elon-musk-space-x/">Federal Aviation Administration</a>, come directly from Musk’s own companies and were not fully vetted before their start dates.</p><p>The auditors also noted that even canceling contracts, as DOGE has done, can add to costs, rather than reduce them, in the long run. For instance, often the government negotiates deals on large purchases where it gets discounts for bulk purchases. Canceling a contract likely not only means the government needs to pay some kind of fee to compensate for the contract cancellation—maybe 10 to 15 percent of the contract amount—but if some or part of that purchase needs to be reinstated later, that initial bulk discount will likely be gone, making it more expensive overall. This was the case with many of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-software-license-cancel-federal-budget/">software licenses</a> that DOGE said it wanted to cut.</p><p>Since sweeping through the government, DOGE has canceled thousands of government contracts, including <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rights-con-taipei-doge-foreign-aid-cuts/">10,000 specifically for humanitarian aid</a>. According to reporting from the Associated Press, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/doge-federal-contracts-canceled-musk-trump-cuts-a65976a725412934ad686389889db0df">40 percent of those canceled contracts</a> through late February will likely not save the government any money.</p><p>“They'll end up costing more in some way, whether it's time, inconvenience, or money,” says the second auditor.</p><p>But the auditors say that there are ways DOGE could get it right. “If DOGE wanted to be the good guys, they could,” says the first auditor. “I’d start by looking at existing Inspector General recommendations.” On the website for the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services, for instance, there are <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/reports/recommendations/tracker/?view-mode=report-grouped&amp;hhs-agency=all">more than 1,200 recommendations</a> that have yet to be implemented that could potentially save the government hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>In an <a data-offer-url="https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/elon-musk-goes-behind-the-scenes-doge-unveils-biggest-source-fraud" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/elon-musk-goes-behind-the-scenes-doge-unveils-biggest-source-fraud&quot;}" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/elon-musk-goes-behind-the-scenes-doge-unveils-biggest-source-fraud" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">interview on FOX Business</a> with Larry Kudlow, when asked about how his team was identifying what to go after in the government, Musk replied, “We look at the president's executive orders, and we also just follow the money.”</p><p>The auditors say they aren’t necessarily against bringing in people from outside the government to help streamline government processes—something that the government was already doing before Trump was sworn in for his second term. For instance, 18F, the digital services agency within the GSA’s Technology Transformation Services, was explicitly designed to serve as an in-house consultancy that would allow federal agencies to leverage private sector expertise. As part of DOGE’s sweep of the government, however, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-major-government-tech-projects-efficiency/">it has gutted the group</a>, putting a pause on several ongoing projects to make government services more efficient for users.</p><p>And it’s these actions, the second auditor says, that best show that DOGE’s intentions may not be geared toward “efficiency” at all. “It’s a con,” they allege.</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><code>git-who</code> is a command-line tool for answering that eternal question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><em>Who wrote this code?!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Unlike <code>git blame</code>, which can tell you who wrote a <em>line</em> of code, <code>git-who</code>
tells you the people responsible for entire components or subsystems in a
codebase. You can think of <code>git-who</code> sort of like <code>git blame</code> but for file
trees rather than individual files.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">From Source</h3><a id="user-content-from-source" aria-label="Permalink: From Source" href="#from-source"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Building from source requires that you have Go, Ruby, and the <code>rake</code> Ruby gem
installed. Note that these are <em>only</em> required when building from source; you
can download and run one of the binary releases without installing any of these
tools.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ git clone git@github.com:sinclairtarget/git-who.git

<p dir="auto"><em>(In the following examples, <code>git-who</code> is invoked as <code>git who</code>. This will work
automatically as long as Git can find <code>git-who</code> in your PATH. See the <a href="#git-alias">Git
Alias</a> section for more details.)</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>git who</code> has three subcommands. Each subcommand gives you a different view of

<p dir="auto">The <code>table</code> subcommand is the default subcommand. You can invoke it explicitly
as <code>git who table</code> or implicitly just as <code>git who</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>table</code> subcommand prints a table summarizing the contributions of every
author who has made commits in the repository:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Options</h4><a id="user-content-options" aria-label="Permalink: Options" href="#options"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>-m</code>, <code>-c</code>, <code>-l</code>, and <code>-f</code> flags allow you to sort the table by different

<p dir="auto">The <code>-m</code> flag sorts the table by the "Last Edit" column, showing who
edited the repository most recently. The <code>-c</code> flag sorts the table by first
edit, so that the authors who committed to the repository earliest are at the
top.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>-l</code> flag sorts the table by number of lines modified, adding some more
columns:</p>

<p dir="auto">You may notice that some files, like <code>lexer.c</code>, are not annotated.
If a file is not annotated, that is because the author who has
most contributed to that file is the same as the author who
has most contributed to the directory containing the file. This is
done to minimize visual noise.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can force <code>git-who tree</code> to annotate every file using the <code>-a</code>

<p dir="auto"><code>git who</code> caches data on a per-repository basis under <code>XDG_CACHE_HOME</code> (this is
<code>~/.cache</code> if the environment variable is not set).</p>
<p dir="auto">You can disable caching by setting <code>GIT_WHO_DISABLE_CACHE=1</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Git Alias</h2><a id="user-content-git-alias" aria-label="Permalink: Git Alias" href="#git-alias"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you install the <code>git-who</code> binary somewhere in your path, running <code>git who</code>
will automatically invoke it with no further configuration. This is a Git
feature.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you install the binary using a different name or just like to be explicit
you can configure a Git alias in your global Git config like so:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[alias]
    who = &quot;!git-who-executable-name&quot;"><pre><code>[alias]
    who = "!git-who-executable-name"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases" rel="nofollow">here</a> for more
information about Git aliases.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Git Mailmap</h2><a id="user-content-git-mailmap" aria-label="Permalink: Git Mailmap" href="#git-mailmap"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Quite often, people end up committing to a repository under different names or
using different email addresses. For example, someone might make a commit using
the name "Nathan Smith" and their work email address and then later make a
commit using the name "Nate Smith" and their personal email address.</p>
<p dir="auto">How can you make sure that all of someone's commits are counted together
instead of being attributed to three or four different people with slightly
different names?</p>
<p dir="auto">Git already has a solution for his problem called <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmailmap" rel="nofollow">Git
mailmap</a>. If a <code>.mailmap</code> file is present
in a Git repository, <code>git who</code> will respect it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What Exactly Do These Numbers Mean?</h2><a id="user-content-what-exactly-do-these-numbers-mean" aria-label="Permalink: What Exactly Do These Numbers Mean?" href="#what-exactly-do-these-numbers-mean"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Metrics</h3><a id="user-content-metrics" aria-label="Permalink: Metrics" href="#metrics"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The number of <strong>commits</strong> shown for each author is the number of unique commits
found while walking the commit log. When supplying a path argument to <code>git who</code>, the commits walked include only commits modifying the given path(s).
Here, the rules described under the HISTORY SIMPLIFICATION section of Git log
apply—branches in the commit history that do not modify the given path(s) are
pruned away.</p>
<p dir="auto">The number of <strong>files</strong> shown for each author is the number of unique files
modified in commits by that author. If a file is renamed, it will count twice.</p>
<p dir="auto">The number of <strong>lines added</strong> and <strong>lines removed</strong> shown for each author is
the number of lines added and removed to files under the supplied path(s) or to
all files in the case of no path arguments. In Git, modifying a line counts as
removing it and then adding the new version of the line.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Merge Commits</h3><a id="user-content-merge-commits" aria-label="Permalink: Merge Commits" href="#merge-commits"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Merge commits are not counted toward any of these metrics. The rationale here
is that merge commits represent a kind of overhead involved in managing the
commit graph and that all novel changes will already have been introduced to
the commit graph by the merge commit's ancestor commits.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can supply the <code>--merges</code> flag to <code>git who</code> to change this behavior. The
<code>--merges</code> flag forces <code>git who</code> to count merge commits toward the commit total
for each author. Merge commits are still ignored for the purposes of the file
total or lines total.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Differences From <code>git blame</code></h3><a id="user-content-differences-from-git-blame" aria-label="Permalink: Differences From git blame" href="#differences-from-git-blame"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Whereas <code>git blame</code> starts from the code that exists in the working tree and
identifies the commit that introduced each line, <code>git who</code> instead walks some
subset of the commit log tallying contributions. This means that <code>git blame</code>
and <code>git who</code>, in addition to operating on different levels (individual files
vs file trees), tell you slightly different things.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is best illustrated through an example. If Bob has made dozens of commits
editing a file, but Alice recently formatted the file and made one big commit
with her style changes, <code>git blame</code> will attribute most of the lines in the
file to Alice. <code>git who</code>, on the other hand, will rank Bob as the primary
author, at least when sorting by number of commits. In this case, <code>git who</code>
seems better suited to answering the question, "Who came up with the code in
this file?"</p>
<p dir="auto">If instead, Bob made the same commits but Alice came along later and completely
refactored the file, again in one big commit, <code>git blame</code> will correctly
attribute most of the lines in the file to her, while <code>git who</code> will still list
Bob as the primary author. In this case, <code>git blame</code> seems to do a better job
of answering, "Who came up with the code in this file?". That said, the various
subcommands and options of <code>git who</code> can give you the full picture of what has
happened here. <code>git who hist</code> in particular will show you that Bob was the
primary author until Alice took over.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ultimately, neither tool quite answers what we want to know, which is "Who came
up with the code in this file?", perhaps because the question is too ambiguous.
<code>git blame</code> answers, "Who last modified each line of code in this file?" and
<code>git who</code> answers, "Who made the most modifications to this file / this file
tree?"</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">DEVELOPMENT</h2><a id="user-content-development" aria-label="Permalink: DEVELOPMENT" href="#development"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Test Repository Submodule</h3><a id="user-content-test-repository-submodule" aria-label="Permalink: Test Repository Submodule" href="#test-repository-submodule"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Some of the automated tests for <code>git-who</code> need to run against a Git repository.
A test repository is attached to this repository as a submodule.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to run the automated tests, you will first need to set up the
submodule:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ git submodule update --init"><pre><code>$ git submodule update --init

            <guid>43403377</guid>
            <pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:56:53 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/news/release-7.1">https://joinpeertube.org/news/release-7.1</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43403377">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're excited to release version 7.1 of PeerTube, which continues to evolve graphically, but also to simplify your discoverability! Let's take a closer look.</p>
<h4>Redesign of ‘About’ pages</h4>
<p>Thanks to the work of <a href="https://www.lacooperativedesinternets.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">La Coopérative des Internets</a>, the "About" pages of the platforms have been redesigned to make them even clearer and easier to access, with information such as a description of the platform, the terms of use, some key figures, the main rules in clear sentences, etc. We've had a lot of positive feedback and hope you like it too!</p>
<figure>

<h4>Better platform identification</h4>
<p>The concept of platform federation is not always easy to explain, so why not take it one step at a time? That's what this new video component does by highlighting the address of the platform where the video is hosted. Clicking on it gives you an explanation of where the video comes from and you can get more information, such as seeing all the videos hosted on the remote platform.</p>
<figure>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://joinpeertube.org/img/news/release-7.1/en/peertube7_1-informations-dropdown.png" title="" alt="">  </figure>

<h4>Your PeerTube content as a podcast</h4>
<p>Podcasts are a very popular way of consuming content, so it's important to make them easy to distribute. PeerTube was already compatible with <a href="https://podcasting2.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Podcast 2.0</a>, which brings new features (transcription, chaptering, etc.) to the world of podcasts. Version 7.1 improves support for Podcast 2.0, allowing users to subscribe to channels and play the video audio stream (if available) using classic podcast applications (<a href="https://antennapod.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AntennaPod</a>, <a href="https://podverse.fm/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Podverse</a>, etc.).</p>
<p>In addition, this new version also makes the podcast feed compatible with Apple Podcast, allowing content creators who have correctly added a banner, avatar and description to their channel to submit their <a href="https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#tag/Video-Feeds/operation/getVideosPodcastFeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast feed</a> to Apple.</p>
<h4>Revised views</h4>
<p>The new view protocol, which increases the number of simultaneous viewers by reducing the number of messages sent to the federation, is now enabled by default. We talked about this in <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/news/stress-test-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the stress test we ran on PeerTube</a> in December 2023 (it's a bit technical).</p>
<h4>Verification on Mastodon</h4>
<p>Mastodon's micro-blogging software allows you to link your accounts to certify them. This allows you to say on your profiles ‘This account is also mine!</p>
<p>It's now possible to do this for channels and PeerTube platforms! To do this, add the link <code>&lt;a href="https://my-mastodon-instance/@profile" rel="me"&gt;Follow me on Mastodon!&lt;/a&gt;</code> (replace <code>https://my-mastodon-instance/@profile</code> with your actual Mastodon profile link) to the description section of your channel and/or profile. Administrators can do the same from their homepage settings.</p>
<h4>Playback stability</h4>
<p>We worked hard to update <a href="https://github.com/novage/p2p-media-loader" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">p2p-media-loader</a>, the library that allows PeerTube to run P2P in the video player, to improve the stability of the player, especially for live streams configured in 'low latency' mode! It's certainly less visible work, but it's something we're proud of because it really improves the user experience. Many thanks to the developers of this library who have done a great job!</p>
<h4>And much, much more!</h4>
<p>As always, we're only highlighting some of the improvements to the software, but you can find the full list of changes made by the community in <a href="https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/releases/tag/v7.1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the changelog</a>!</p>
<p>To help us continue to improve PeerTube, you can share this information, <a href="https://ideas.joinpeertube.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggest improvements</a> and, if you can afford it, make <a href="https://support.joinpeertube.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a donation to Framasoft</a>, the non-for-profit organisation behind PeerTube.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your support!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><p>The Trump administration’s Federal Trade Commission has removed four years worth of business guidance blogs as of Tuesday morning, including important consumer protection information related to artificial intelligence and the agency’s landmark privacy lawsuits under former chair Lina Khan against companies like Amazon and Microsoft. More than 300 blogs were removed.</p><p>On the FTC’s website, the page hosting all of the agency’s <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance">business-related blogs and guidance</a> no longer includes any information published during former president Joe Biden’s administration, current and former FTC employees, who spoke under anonymity for fear of retaliation, tell WIRED. These blogs contained advice from the FTC on how big tech companies could avoid violating consumer protection laws.</p><p>One now deleted blog, titled <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/06/20-million-ftc-settlement-addresses-microsoft-xbox-illegal-collection-kids-data-game-changer-coppa">“Hey, Alexa! What are you doing with my data?”</a> explains how, according to two FTC complaints, Amazon and its Ring security camera products allegedly leveraged sensitive consumer data to train the ecommerce giant’s algorithms. (Amazon disagreed with the FTC’s claims.) It also provided guidance for companies operating similar products and services. Another post titled <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/06/20-million-ftc-settlement-addresses-microsoft-xbox-illegal-collection-kids-data-game-changer-coppa">“$20 million FTC settlement addresses Microsoft Xbox illegal collection of kids’ data: A game changer for COPPA compliance”</a> instructs tech companies on how to abide by Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act by using the 2023 Microsoft settlement as an example. The settlement followed <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/06/ftc-will-require-microsoft-pay-20-million-over-charges-it-illegally-collected-personal-information">allegations by the FTC that Microsoft obtained data</a> from children using Xbox systems without the consent of their parents or guardians.</p><p>“In terms of the message to industry on what our compliance expectations were, which is in some ways the most important part of enforcement action, they are trying to just erase those from history,” a source familiar tells WIRED.</p><p>Another removed FTC blog titled <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/05/luring-test-ai-engineering-consumer-trust">“The Luring Test: AI and the engineering of consumer trust”</a> outlines how businesses could avoid creating chatbots that violate the FTC Act’s rules against unfair or deceptive products. This blog <a data-offer-url="https://techprimers.aspendigital.org/hall-of-fame/2023-05-01/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://techprimers.aspendigital.org/hall-of-fame/2023-05-01/&quot;}" href="https://techprimers.aspendigital.org/hall-of-fame/2023-05-01/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">won an award in 2023</a> for “excellent descriptions of artificial intelligence.”</p><p>The Trump administration has received broad support from the tech industry. Big tech companies like Amazon and Meta as well as tech entrepreneurs like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, all donated to Trump’s inauguration fund. Other Silicon Valley leaders, like Elon Musk and David Sacks, are officially advising the administration. Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employs technologists sourced from Musk’s tech companies. And already, federal agencies like the General Services Administration have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gsai-chatbot-1500-federal-workers/">started to roll out AI products like GSAi</a>, a general purpose government chatbot.</p><p>The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.</p><p>Removing blogs raises serious compliance concerns under the Federal Records Act and the Open Government Data Act, one former FTC official tells WIRED. During the Biden administration, FTC leadership would place “warning” labels above previous administrations’ public decisions it no longer agreed with, the source said, fearing that removal would violate the law.</p><p>Since President Donald Trump designated Andrew Ferguson to replace Khan as FTC chair in January, the Republican regulator has vowed to leverage his authority to go after big tech companies. Unlike Khan, however, Ferguson’s criticisms center around the Republican party’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-bogus-fears-of-censorship-could-spell-the-end-of-content-moderation/">longstanding allegations that social media platforms</a>, like Facebook and Instagram, censor conservative speech online. Before being selected as chair, Ferguson told Trump that his vision for the agency also included rolling back Biden-era regulations on artificial intelligence and tougher merger standards, <a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/technology/trump-ftc-andrew-ferguson.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/technology/trump-ftc-andrew-ferguson.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/technology/trump-ftc-andrew-ferguson.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the New York Times reported in December</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWYo_w_A_uU&amp;themeRefresh=1">In an interview with CNBC last week</a>, Ferguson argued that content moderation could equate to an antitrust violation. "If companies are degrading their product quality by kicking people off because they hold particular views, that could be an indication that there's a competition problem,” he said.</p><p>Sources speaking with WIRED on Tuesday claimed that tech companies are the only groups who benefit from the removal of these blogs.</p><p>“They are talking a big game on censorship. But at the end of the day, the thing that really hits these companies bottom line is what data they can collect, how they can use that data, whether they can train their AI models on that data, and if this administration is planning to take the foot off the gas there while stepping up its work on censorship,” the source familiar alleges. “I think that's a change big tech would be very happy with.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Come March 28, those who opted to have their voice commands for Amazon's AI assistant Alexa processed locally on their Echo devices will lose that option, with all spoken requests pushed to the cloud for analysis.</p>
<p>Amazon hasn't formally announced the change, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GQXLLWHBCVL6L5QD" rel="nofollow">help page</a> for the feature still makes no mention of the March 28 deprecation. But the internet souk confirmed to <em>The Register</em> that emails to users about the update, which caused a stir on social media over the weekend, are indeed legit.</p>
<p>"We are reaching out to let you know that the Alexa feature 'Do Not Send Voice Recordings' that you enabled on your supported Echo device(s) will no longer be available beginning March 28, 2025," a copy of the email sent to Echo users relayed to <em>El Reg</em> read.</p>

    

<p>"As we continue to expand Alexa's capabilities with generative AI features that rely on the processing power of Amazon's secure cloud, we have decided to no longer support this feature."</p>
<h3>All your phrase are belong to us</h3>
<p>So there it is, apparently: Alexa's latest generative AI tricks are too demanding for the hardware on the handful of Echo devices that support local processing — the 4th-gen Echo Dot, Echo Show 10, and Show 15. Less powerful Echo gadgets don't have any option for processing locally. Therefore, all spoken Alexa requests are going up into Amazon systems for remote processing.</p>
<p>Privacy-conscious users who enabled the "Do Not Send Voice Recordings" setting won't get a say; it's being disabled automatically. Not that many people bothered enabling the local option in the first place, Amazon claims.</p>

        


        

<p>"If you do not take action, your Alexa Settings will automatically be updated to 'Don't save recordings,'" Amazon told affected users.</p>
<p>"Starting on March 28, your voice recordings will be sent to and processed in the cloud, and they will be deleted after Alexa processes your requests," the email continued. "If your voice recordings setting is updated to 'Don't save recordings,' voice ID will not work and you will not be able to create a voice ID for individual users to access more personalized features."</p>

        

<p>In other words, unless you let Amazon store your recordings, you're stuck with a feature-limited Alexa. And all voice commands are going up regardless.</p>
<h3>Private, for a given definition of privacy</h3>
<p>While Echo owners may not be happy about about losing the option for on-device audio processing, the soon-to-be-scrapped feature wasn't exactly airtight with its privacy protection to begin with.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G4X4X8C26Z73P8SQ" rel="nofollow">Amazon help page</a> that gives more detail on the Do Not Send Voice Recordings option notes that even when audio recordings stay local, a text transcript of each request still gets shipped off to Amazon's cloud for processing anyway. Those transcripts are stored right alongside voice recordings and don't auto-delete — you have to manually purge them via your Voice History, assuming you knew they existed in the first place.</p>
<p>Amazon customers shouldn't be surprised, though: The tech titan's approach to privacy has long raised eyebrows, particularly when it comes to Alexa and the other gadgets it plants in homes to gain an audio and visual foothold.</p>
<p>Studies have <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/27/amazon_audio_data/">claimed</a> that Amazon uses Alexa voice interaction data to help target ads — both on Echo devices and across the web. Third-party apps available for Alexa-enabled devices don't offer much comfort either, at times <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/07/29/amazon_google_voice_apps/">lacking</a> clear privacy policies or adequate safeguards on how user data is handled.</p>

        

<p>Then there's last year's drama in America surrounding Ring cameras, when the FTC claimed the super-corp's lax security controls allowed Amazon employees and contractors <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/25/ring_ftc_settlement/">to access</a> customers' private video feeds. The agency also <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/01/ftc_alexa_ring_amazon_settlement/">alleged</a> that Amazon unlawfully retained Alexa voice recordings of children indefinitely, violating child privacy laws.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<li>2018: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/05/24/alexa_recording_couple/">You know that silly fear about Alexa recording everything and leaking it online? It just happened</a></li>

<li>2018: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/10/15/alexa_sound_recognition/">Alexa heard what you did last summer – and she knows what that was, too: AI recognizes activities from sound</a></li>

<li>2019: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/04/11/amazon_staff_listen_to_alexa/">As Alexa's secret human army is revealed, we ask: Who else has been listening in on you?</a></li>

<li>2022: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/14/voice_assistants_failed/">Voice assistants failed because they serve their makers more than they help users</a></li>

<li>2024: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/04/washington_dc_amazon_prime/">Amazon accused of cheating low-income Prime users out of two-day deliveries</a></li>

<li>2025: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/02/apple_siri_lawsuit/">Apple offers to settle 'snooping Siri' lawsuit for an utterly incredible $95M</a></li>

<li>2025: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/30/amazon_sued_for_snarfing_sensitive/">Amazon sued for allegedly slurping sensitive data via advertising SDK</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon, naturally, denies that eliminating the on-device processing feature will impede user privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The Alexa experience is designed to protect our customers' privacy and keep their data secure, and that's not changing," an Amazon spokesperson told us. "We're focusing on the privacy tools and controls that our customers use most and work well with generative AI experiences that rely on the processing power of Amazon's secure cloud."</p>
<p>It's those generative AI updates, revealed in late February alongside the <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence" rel="nofollow">launch</a> of Alexa+, that appear to be driving the change. The three devices mentioned by Amazon as supporting local voice processing (Dot 4, Show 10, Show 15) are all in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCCNHWV5?ref=ods_surl_xaa_us#:~:text=What%20devices%20can%20customers%20use%20Alexa%2B%20on%3F" rel="nofollow">lineup</a> of devices supported by Alexa+, which Amazon is no doubt keen to push users to adopt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike the classic Alexa, which Amazon said will continue to be available, generative AI through Alexa+ - and the fresh stream of user data required to fuel them - will only be available to Amazon Prime subscribers, or anyone willing to shell out $19.99 per month without Prime. Whether you're sticking with Alexa or using Alexa+, commands are processed remotely.</p>
<p>Amazon told us customers will still have plenty of privacy options available, "including the option to not save their voice recordings at all." That feature, as we noted above, means losing out on many essential Alexa features, like the voice assistant being able to recognize an individual speaker and respond based on their preferences, which for many multi-user households is an essential feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We'll continue learning from customer feedback, and building privacy features on their behalf," Amazon said.&nbsp;®</p>
<p>
  <em><strong>Speaking of AI...</strong> Under the direction of President Donald Trump and his US government standards body NIST, scientists linked to the federally funded Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute have been told to talk less about “AI safety,” “responsible AI,” and “AI fairness,” and focus more on “reducing ideological bias, to enable human flourishing and economic competitiveness,” in machine-learning research, WiReD magazine <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-safety-institute-new-directive-america-first/">reports</a>.</em>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p dir="ltr">Today, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Project</a> is excited to announce that the&nbsp;<a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-linux-42-beta/">beta version of Fedora 42</a>–the latest version of the free and open source operating system–is now available. Learn more about the new and updated features of Fedora 42 Beta below and don’t forget to ensure your system is fully up-to-date before upgrading from a previous release.</p><h3 dir="ltr">What’s new in Fedora 42 Beta?</h3><h4 dir="ltr">Anaconda</h4><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><strong>Native Wayland application:</strong> Anaconda is now a native Wayland application in F42 Beta. It no longer supports X11 and instead, users can expect to have more consistent keyboard control with Anaconda being able to control keyboard layouts in the Wayland environment on Live ISOs and the remote graphical installations will use RDP instead of VNC.</li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><strong>Web UI partitioning:</strong> The anaconda team have launched a new web user interface (UI) for partitioning in F42 Beta. With this new feature, the biggest benefit to Fedora users is the new guided partitioning function. This provides a more powerful automatic partitioning, where the user will select a goal and have additional customizations possible. This change also comes with a new "reinstall Fedora" which allows users to easily reinstall their system if something went wrong, and easy support for dual-boot installation. Users only need to make a free space and don’t have to understand other details.</li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><strong>Web UI is now default for Fedora Workstation:</strong> This new web-based UI for the OS installer is now default for Fedora Workstation in F42 Beta. This means that users can enjoy a smooth installation experience, with features such as an installation progress indicator, built in help, configuration review and more. This new feature also includes&nbsp;<a href="https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/anaconda-is-getting-a-new-suit-and-a-wizard/">Wizard</a> that will allow users to skip what they don't need at installation.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4 dir="ltr">KDE Plasma edition</h4><p dir="ltr">KDE Plasma has been promoted to edition status from F42 Beta onwards! You can expect to continue to enjoy the same level of quality from Fedora KDE as you always have, plus Fedora KDE is now supported on power systems (ppc64le). The full KDE stack (including KDE PIM) is also available on power. Additionally, F42 Beta offers installable live images for OpenPOWER based systems like the Talos Workstation from<a href="https://www.raptorcs.com/">&nbsp;Raptor Systems</a>.</p><h4 dir="ltr">Fedora COSMIC spin</h4><p dir="ltr">We have a new spin! Introducing the Fedora COSMIC spin - a new rust-based desktop environment developed by System76, makers of Pop!_OS. COSMIC has many unique features, such as hybrid per-workspace window/tiling management, window stacks with tabs to switch between windows and robust customization features that integrate with GTK and (later on) Qt!&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">EROFS for live media</h4><p dir="ltr">We’ve switched the read-only filesystem image format from SquashFS to EROFS for Fedora live media for all kiwi-produced live media, such as KDE desktop and mobile, COSMIC, Budgie, MiracleWM, Fedora CoreOS live media and more. This change aligns with our downstream and RHEL, which creates a more efficient ecosystem for developers to work in both upstream and downstream.</p><h4 dir="ltr">RPM support for systemd sysusers.d</h4><p dir="ltr">RPM supports creating users and groups according to configuration provided in sysusers.d snippets shipped in package payload. This new feature goes towards fully integrating this RPM functionality in Fedora.</p><h4 dir="ltr">DNF/RPM copy on write for all variants</h4><p dir="ltr">The RPM copy on write feature will provide a better experience for Fedora users as it reduces the amount of I/O and offsets CPU cost of package decompression. RPM copy on write uses reflinking capabilities in btrfs, which has been the default filesystem since Fedora 33 for most variants. Note that this behavior is not being turned on by default for this change.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Setuptools 74+</h4><p dir="ltr">Fedora 42 Beta will include the latest upstream release of python-setuptools. Setuptools is a package development process library designed to facilitate packaging Python projects by enhancing the former Python standard library distutils (distribution utilities). It changes quickly and often introduces breaking changes such as the removal of the&nbsp;setup.py test command in version 72.0.0 which was deprecated in 2019.</p><p dir="ltr">If your Fedora package still uses the&nbsp;setup.py test command, please update to&nbsp;%pytest,&nbsp;%tox,&nbsp;%{python3} -m unittest, etc.</p><h4 dir="ltr">DNF5</h4><p dir="ltr">There has been some work done with DNF5 that now includes new logic that will remove expired and obsolete repository keys from the system, which means users can enjoy the automatic management of repository keys during software installation or upgrades.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">NumPy2</h4><p dir="ltr">F42 Beta will include an update to NumPy2. Most packages will be unaffected, but those using the C API may need to rebuild. This update brings more up to date fixes, performance improvements and better documentation.</p><h4 dir="ltr">Ruby 3.4</h4><p dir="ltr">Ruby 3.4 is the latest stable version of Ruby. Many new features and improvements are included for the increasingly diverse and expanding demands for Ruby. With this major update from Ruby 3.3 in Fedora 41 to Ruby 3.4 in Fedora 42, Fedora becomes the superior Ruby development platform.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr">Retirements and deprecations</h3><h4 dir="ltr">Retiring of python3.8</h4><p dir="ltr">The<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/File:Package-x-generic-16.png">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python3.8">python3.8</a> package will be retired without replacement beginning with<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/w/index.php?title=Releases/42&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">&nbsp;Fedora Linux 42</a>. As Python 3.8 is EOL, and Ubuntu’s LTS also goes out of standard support by the release time of F42, we will no longer be supporting this version in Fedora Linux.</p><h4 dir="ltr">Python-pytest-runner</h4><p dir="ltr">The python-pytest-runner package will be deprecated in F42 Beta. Dependent packages are encouraged to switch to using pytest directly.</p><h4 dir="ltr">Atomic Desktops will no longer be built for PPC64LE</h4><p dir="ltr">From F42 Beta, we will no longer be building Fedora Atomic Desktops for PowerPC 64 LE. Users of Atomic Desktops on PPC64LE can either switch back to a Fedora package mode installation, or build their own images using bootable containers which are available for PPC64LE.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Retirement of Zezere provisioning server for Fedora IoT</h4><p dir="ltr">We will be retiring the use of the&nbsp;<a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/zezere">Zezere</a> provisioning server, which is currently used to configure Fedora IoT devices. Instead, we’ve moved the Zezere provisioning server in favour of offering a local means for user configuration -&nbsp;systemd-firstboot. This will provide users with a more robust, well-tested configuration method that is already installed by default with&nbsp;systemd. Users will still be able to use the existing configuration options of&nbsp;FIDO Device Onboarding or&nbsp;ignition.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr">What is a Fedora Beta release?</h3><p dir="ltr">Fedora Beta releases are code-complete and will very closely resemble the final release. While the Fedora Project community will be testing this release intensely, we also want our end users to check and make sure that the features you care about are working as intended. The bugs you find and report help make your experience better as well as for millions of Fedora Linux users worldwide! Together, we can help not only make Fedora Linux stronger, but as these fixes and tweaks get pushed upstream to the kernel community, we can contribute to the betterment of the Linux ecosystem and free software holistically.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Let’s test Fedora 42 Beta together</h3><p dir="ltr">Since this is a Beta release, we expect that you may encounter bugs or missing features. To report issues encountered during testing, contact the Fedora QA team via the<a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/test%40lists.fedoraproject.org/"> test mailing list</a> or in the<a href="https://chat.fedoraproject.org/#/room/#quality:fedoraproject.org"> #quality:fedoraproject.org channel on Fedora Chat</a> (Matrix). As testing progresses, common issues are tracked in the “Common Issues” category on Ask Fedora.</p><p dir="ltr">For tips on reporting a bug effectively, read<a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/howto-file-a-bug/"> how to file a bug</a>.</p>

<p>DuckDB has supported reading Iceberg tables <a href="https://duckdb.org/2023/09/26/announcing-duckdb-090.html">since September 2023</a> via the <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/iceberg/overview.html"><code>iceberg</code> extension</a>. Today, we are happy to introduce a new preview feature in this extension, which allows attaching to <a href="https://www.tabular.io/apache-iceberg-cookbook/getting-started-catalog-background/">Iceberg REST catalogs</a>. This preview release coincides with two AWS announcements yesterday: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/amazon-s3-tables-apache-iceberg-rest-catalog-apis/">support for Iceberg tables in Amazon S3 Tables</a> and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/amazon-sagemaker-lakehouse-integration-s3-tables-generally-available/">GA release of the integration between S3 Tables and SageMaker Lakehouse (AWS Glue Data Catalog)</a>. In practice, these developments mean that DuckDB now provides an end-to-end solution for reading Iceberg tables in <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/iceberg/amazon_s3_tables.html">S3 Tables</a> and <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/iceberg/amazon_sagemaker_lakehouse.html">SageMaker Lakehouse</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DuckDB's support for Iceberg REST Catalog endpoints in Amazon S3 Tables is the result of a collaboration between AWS and DuckDB Labs.</p>

<p>To connect to Apache Iceberg REST Catalogs in DuckDB,
make sure you are running the <strong>latest stable</strong> DuckDB release (version 1.2.1).
For our example steps, we'll use the DuckDB <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/overview.html">CLI client</a>.
You can obtain this client from the <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/">installation page</a> and start it with:</p>



<p>Next, we need to install the “bleeding edge” versions of the required extensions from the <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/installing_extensions.html#extension-repositories"><code>core_nightly</code> repository</a>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>FORCE</span> <span>INSTALL</span> <span>aws</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>core_nightly</span><span>;</span>
<span>FORCE</span> <span>INSTALL</span> <span>httpfs</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>core_nightly</span><span>;</span>
<span>FORCE</span> <span>INSTALL</span> <span>iceberg</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>core_nightly</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>For more information on using the <code>core_nightly</code> repository, please see the <a href="#footnotes">notes</a> at the end of the post.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With these extensions installed, your DuckDB is now capable of using Apache Iceberg REST Catalogs.
Let's find some data.</p>

      </h3>
    

<p>(If you already have Iceberg tables in Amazon S3 Tables, you can skip to the <a href="#reading-amazon-s3-tables-with-duckdb">“Reading Iceberg Catalogs with DuckDB” section</a>.)</p>

<p>In this post, we demonstrate how to read data from Amazon S3 Tables.
To follow along, make sure that your account has <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-tables-setting-up.html"><code>s3tables</code> permissions</a>
and create a new <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-tables-buckets.html">S3 table bucket</a>.
Note that Amazon S3 Tables is currently only supported in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-tables-regions-quotas.html">selected AWS regions</a>.</p>

      </h3>
    

<p>If you don't have an S3 table bucket with tables already, we found the easiest way to get going is to create a table using Amazon Athena.
See their <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-tables-getting-started.html#s2-tables-tutorial-EMR-cluster">instructions</a>.
For our example, we created a simple table with three columns using the Athena query editor:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>duck_species</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span> <span>INT</span><span>,</span>
    <span>english_name</span> <span>STRING</span><span>,</span>
    <span>latin_name</span> <span>STRING</span>
<span>)</span> <span>TBLPROPERTIES</span> <span>(</span><span>'table_type'</span> <span>=</span> <span>'ICEBERG'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let's insert some data to the table:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>duck_species</span> <span>VALUES</span>
    <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>'Anas nivis'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Snow duck'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>
      <h3 id="reading-amazon-s3-tables-with-duckdb">
        
        <a href="#reading-amazon-s3-tables-with-duckdb">Reading Amazon S3 Tables with DuckDB</a>
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Querying S3 Tables with DuckDB is really easy.
The first step is to get your AWS credentials into DuckDB.
You can achieve this in two ways.
First, you can let DuckDB detect your AWS credentials and configuration based on the default profile in your <code>~/.aws</code> directory by creating the following secret using the <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/configuration/secrets_manager.html">Secrets Manager</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>SECRET</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>TYPE</span> <span>s3</span><span>,</span>
    <span>PROVIDER</span> <span>credential_chain</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, you can set the AWS key, secret, and region values manually. For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>SECRET</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>TYPE</span> <span>s3</span><span>,</span>
    <span>KEY_ID</span> <span>'</span><span>AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>SECRET</span> <span>'</span><span>wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>REGION</span> <span>'</span><span>us-east-1</span><span>'</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tip To see the secrets in your session, run <code><span>FROM</span> <span>duckdb_secrets</span><span>();</span></code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, point DuckDB to your S3 table bucket.
You can do so by copy-pasting the S3 Tables ARN value directly from the AWS Management Console and using it in the <code>ATTACH</code> command:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>ATTACH</span> <span>'arn:aws:s3tables:</span><span>us-east-1</span><span>:</span><span>111122223333</span><span>:bucket/</span><span>bucket_name</span><span>'</span>
    <span>AS</span> <span>s3_tables_db</span> <span>(</span>
        <span>TYPE</span> <span>iceberg</span><span>,</span>
        <span>ENDPOINT_TYPE</span> <span>s3_tables</span>
    <span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And that's all! Now, DuckDB is connected to Amazon S3 Tables. 
To show the available tables, run:</p>



<div><pre><code>┌──────────────┬─────────┬───────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬───────────┐
│   database   │ schema  │     name      │ column_names │ column_types │ temporary │
│   varchar    │ varchar │    varchar    │  varchar[]   │  varchar[]   │  boolean  │
├──────────────┼─────────┼───────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼───────────┤
│ s3_tables_db │ ducks   │ duck_species  │ [__]         │ [INTEGER]    │ false     │
└──────────────┴─────────┴───────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴───────────┘
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can query tables as if they were ordinary DuckDB tables:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>FROM</span> <span>s3_tables_db</span><span>.</span><span>ducks</span><span>.</span><span>duck_species</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code>┌───────┬──────────────┬────────────┐
│  id   │ english_name │ latin_name │
│ int32 │   varchar    │  varchar   │
├───────┼──────────────┼────────────┤
│   0   │ Anas nivis   │ Snow duck  │
└───────┴──────────────┴────────────┘
</code></pre></div>

<p>You also have an alternative option to connect to S3 Tables using the Amazon SageMaker Lakehouse (AWS Glue Data Catalog) Iceberg REST Catalog endpoint.
To do so, run:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>ATTACH</span> <span>'</span><span>account_id</span><span>:s3tablescatalog/</span><span>namespace_name</span><span>'</span>
<span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>TYPE</span> <span>iceberg</span><span>,</span>
    <span>ENDPOINT_TYPE</span> <span>glue</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tip If you need basic read access to tabular data in a single S3 table bucket, use the <code>s3_tables</code> endpoint type.
If you want a unified view across all of your tabular data in AWS, use the <code>glue</code> endpoint type.</p>
</blockquote>
      <h3 id="schema-evolution">
        
        <a href="#schema-evolution">Schema Evolution</a>
        
      </h3>
    

<p>A key feature of the Iceberg format is <a href="https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/1.7.1/evolution/">schema evolution</a>,
i.e., the ability to follow changes in the table's schema.
To demonstrate this, we go back to the Athena query editor and add a new column to the <code>duck_species</code> table:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>duck_species</span>
    <span>ADD</span> <span>COLUMNS</span> <span>(</span><span>conservation_status</span> <span>STRING</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, we insert a few more duck species:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>duck_species</span> <span>VALUES</span>
    <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>'Anas eatoni'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Eaton</span><span>''</span><span>s pintail'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Vulnerable'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>'Histrionicus histrionicus'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Harlequin duck'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Least concern'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let's run the query again from DuckDB:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>FROM</span> <span>s3_tables_db</span><span>.</span><span>ducks</span><span>.</span><span>duck_species</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The query now returns a table with the additional fourth column, which has a <code>NULL</code> value in the row inserted before the change in the schema
– as expected.</p>

<div><pre><code>┌───────┬───────────────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│  id   │       english_name        │   latin_name    │ conservation_status │
│ int32 │          varchar          │     varchar     │       varchar       │
├───────┼───────────────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│     1 │ Anas eatoni               │ Eaton's pintail │ Vulnerable          │
│     2 │ Histrionicus histrionicus │ Harlequin duck  │ Least concern       │
│     0 │ Anas nivis                │ Snow duck       │ NULL                │
└───────┴───────────────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
</code></pre></div>

        <a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a>
        
      </h2>
    

<p>The latest preview release of the DuckDB <code>iceberg</code> extension enables directly reading tables using Iceberg REST endpoints.
This allows you to query Amazon S3 Tables and Amazon SageMaker Lakehouse (AWS Glue Data Catalog) with ease.
As of today, the extension is in an experimental state and is under active development.
We will publish a stable release later this year.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><strong>Engineers focus too much on technical skills,</strong><span> often overlooking other essential skills, such as </span><strong>soft skills—</strong><span>or human skills, as I prefer to call them.</span></p><p><strong>An engineer is more than a technical skill set</strong><span>. First and foremost, an engineer is a human being immersed in a human environment. If they fail to understand how to navigate human complexity and intricacies, they will not understand how a team or an organization works,&nbsp;</span><strong>eventually reducing their ability to build meaningful things and create an impact wherever they go.</strong></p><p><span>Through years of mentoring many engineers, I’ve learned that&nbsp;</span><strong>engineers who master technical and soft skills are very rare. But those who do hold great power.</strong><span>&nbsp;They can create meaningful and significant impact wherever they go.</span></p><p><strong>Technical skills come with experience and can be easier to learn</strong><span>. That’s why I don’t worry too much about them when mentoring engineers. Instead, I prefer focusing on human skills, which I think </span><strong>are the most impactful but also the most neglected skills</strong><span>.</span></p><p><strong>If, up until this point in your career, you have focused on developing your technical skills rather than your soft skills, don’t despair</strong><span>. You are always one decision away from significantly changing your approach. You can radically change your career by focusing on developing your human skills, </span><em>i.e.</em><span>, by focusing on human development. </span></p><p><span>While “human development” is a topic that may seem alien to many engineers, that shouldn’t be a stopper. Everyone has the capacity to develop their human skills because, after all, we are all humans, and that’s all that we need. </span><strong>Human development is just a matter of being intentional and developing curiosity about the human side of things</strong><span>—and, of course, practicing. Like coding, the more you practice, the better you’ll get at it.</span></p><p><span>My aim with the&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Underrated Soft Skills&nbsp;</strong></em><span>series is to bring a fresh voice to the field of human development for engineers. </span></p><p><span>Every day, I hear more engineers interested in learning topics such as communication, stakeholder management, leadership, etc. While this is great,</span><strong>&nbsp;we are just scratching the surface;</strong><span>&nbsp;we can—and should—go deeper.</span></p><p><span>In this new series, I want to explore</span><strong>&nbsp;the most neglected topics in human development for engineers</strong><span>—or at least those few people discuss. I especially want&nbsp;to highlight the most neglected soft skills,</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>and in doing so, I want to open your eyes to a new way of seeing the engineering practice. </span><strong>I want to show you how soft skills and human development can increase your impact</strong><span>, make you a great teammate, and even make you a better human.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As I said before,&nbsp;</span><strong>engineers who master technical and soft skills are rare. But those who are curious enough to pursue mastering these skills</strong><span>&nbsp;have the power to radically change their careers, their lives, and the lives of those around them.</span></p><p><span>Please join me for </span><strong>the first entry in the&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Underrated Soft Skills </strong></em><span>series, where we will discuss one special skill:&nbsp;</span><em><strong>charisma</strong></em><strong>,&nbsp;</strong><span>a skill that can transform everything it touches and turn you into a teammate everyone enjoys working with.</span></p><p><em>Charisma, </em><span>more than a trait,&nbsp;is a set of behaviors that are easy to recognize when you see them. You may not have a word for them, but you recognize them, as they are almost impossible to miss. The same holds true for the opposite. When you see uncharismatic behaviors, you recognize them without skipping a beat.</span></p><p><strong>Everyone in their careers has encountered someone who’s challenging to work with</strong><span>. Think of this person as someone who is constantly complaining, creating drama, or the kind of person who never listens to you and is always absorbed by their own dilemmas—so much they don’t have mind space for you. </span></p><p>Pause for a second here. Can you think of someone that fits the description? What do you think is challenging about them?</p><p><span>Of course, there are many challenges to working with someone like that, but there’s one common trait among all those challenges:&nbsp;</span><strong>these kinds of people create tense environments</strong><span>. They tend to lead other people to exhaustion. They can be demoralizing, exhausting, and irritating. They epitomize what I call </span><em>uncharismatic behavior</em><span>—</span><em>i.e.</em><span>, a behavior that arises when someone becomes so absorbed in their own dilemma that they lose sight of the person in front of them. </span><strong>For people adopting this behavior, listening to others, building empathy, non-judgment, and kindness is difficult</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Opposite to this kind of people, there are </span><strong>the ones that we would label as highly charismatic and the kind of people everyone enjoys working with</strong><span>. Pause once again for a second. Can you think of someone that fits the description? What do you enjoy about them?</span></p><p><span>Once again, you might enjoy many traits about them, but there’s a golden thread:&nbsp;</span><strong>these people lift you up and make you feel good about yourself, and when in their presence, you can feel delighted</strong><span>. They are the kind of people that make you feel comfortable and fill every room they walk in with joy. Their kind and warm aura boosts everyone around them—making you, for a split second, think everything is possible. Ideally, </span><strong>these kinds of people can also make you feel seen and understood. They are inclusive and non-judgmental</strong><span>; you know you can safely open up with them and won’t be criticized. </span><strong>They are the ones everyone enjoys working with</strong><span>.</span></p><p><em><strong>Charisma</strong></em><strong> sets enjoyable coworkers apart from difficult ones.</strong><span> Whether we realize it or not, we constantly adopt behaviors that come across as charismatic or uncharismatic—our awareness of this makes the difference.</span></p><p><span>Charismatic people have internalized these behaviors so profoundly that they seem natural, but don’t be fooled; </span><em>charisma</em><span> can be learned. The same applies to uncharismatic behaviors—they become habitual, but they can change.</span></p><p><span>Instead of labeling people as charismatic or uncharismatic, I believe it's more accurate to recognize that&nbsp;</span><strong>everyone exhibits and can learn both kinds of behaviors</strong><span>. The balance between them comes down to awareness—once you're aware of how </span><em>charisma</em><span> shows up, you can consciously choose how to cultivate it.</span></p><p><em>Charisma</em><span> is like the culture of a big country—rich, diverse, and ever-changing. It has many flavors and traditions that appeal to different people. For example, if you go to the South of your country, you’ll see that its traditions differ from those of the North. Same if you compare traditions from the western to the eastern part. Despite this, everyone stands together as one country. Even if it’s not easy to pinpoint why, there are always common things that unite everyone under the same identity. </span></p><p><span>Just like a country's culture,&nbsp;</span><em><strong>charisma</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;is complex because it is not a single trait but a broad spectrum of traits that share things in common</strong><span>. Many people can embody charismatic behaviours in many different ways;&nbsp;it’s up to you to decide how you want to do it. </span><strong>But you must keep one thing in mind: </strong><em><strong>Charisma</strong></em><strong> is all about how you make others feel.</strong><span> If you can master that, embodying charismatic behaviours will be easy for you. </span></p><p><span>Based on my experience and research,&nbsp;</span><strong>you should master three behaviors to embody charisma</strong><span>: establishing meaningful connections, building empathy, and radiating warmth. Let’s examine each one.</span></p><p><strong><span>We tend to perceive people as charismatic only when they can connect with us meaningfully [</span><a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/being_present_increases_your_charisma" rel="">1</a><span>]. </span></strong><span>Humans are naturally wired for connection. We intuitively know whether we feel connected to someone or whether an interaction feels meaningful or not. </span></p><p>For instance, imagine&nbsp;you are on a call with your manager, and they are answering messages while talking to you. You can see how their eyes move around the screen, looking at everything except you. Every time you pause and ask them something, it takes them a while before they answer—or they may even get lost in what you are saying and ask you to repeat what you just said. How would you feel in such a situation? Would you describe this interaction as highly meaningful? </p><p><span>If you felt your manager was not present and paying attention to you during the call, you would likely not label the interaction as highly meaningful. Additionally, you would likely not describe your manager as charismatic [</span><a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/being_present_increases_your_charisma" rel="">1</a><span>]. As mentioned before, we tend to perceive people as charismatic </span><strong>only when they can connect</strong><span> with us meaningfully. </span></p><p><strong>If you want to build charisma, start by establishing more meaningful connections</strong><span>. This means being present and paying attention to other people:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Focus your attention on the other person.</strong><span> This means that the person in front of you is the only thing that matters for a short time. There’s nothing more important than them. Put away your phone or anything that may disrupt your focus on the other person. Look at their eyes, try to recognize the other human being in front of you, and try to help them feel comfortable talking to you.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Forget about yourself and your dilemmas for a second.&nbsp;</strong><span>Being present for another person is challenging when your feelings carry you away. If you don’t feel centered,&nbsp;</span><em>i.e.</em><span>, you feel stressed, anxious, or agitated. Make space for your feelings and digest them before interacting with others. This will make it easier to forget about yourself for a second and be there for the other person.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Develop a curiosity for what the other person is saying. </strong><span>Connecting with someone else is challenging if you don’t care about what they have to say. Learn to develop a curiosity for the person that is in front of you. For example, instead of just freely talking to someone, picture yourself as a curious interviewer, eager to understand more about the other person and ask unconventional questions that reveal their perspective and experiences. In doing so, you’ll understand more of the person’s background, and building empathy will become easier.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Connect by being vulnerable. </strong><span>It’s easy to hide away from the other person by merely asking questions and not sharing about yourself. Yes, sometimes, you play the role of a curious interviewer. But don’t get attached to that role. You are also another human being. Try to connect with the other by sharing how you see the world and how their experiences relate to yours—when the moment allows it. Connection is all about making the other person feel they are not alone and that you understand them—and that perhaps both of you have gone through the same.</span></p></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong><span> Be aware of undermining the power of connection in the work environment. Some people may feel tempted to think they can separate work from their feelings. But the reality is that it’s not easy. In fact, </span><strong>one of the most significant predictors of high-performing teams and good work environments</strong><span> is the amount and quality of connections you have at work—check [</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFTR-ueP9I" rel="">2</a><span>] for more info.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Empathy means putting yourself in the other person's shoes. </span><strong>Feel what they feel</strong><span>—and if that’s out of reach for you right now, at least it means acknowledging that you may not understand what they are going through, but you respect it.</span></p><p><span>Empathy is key to building meaningful connections and, ultimately, embodying&nbsp;</span><em>charisma</em><span>. Empathy brings people together and creates peace instead of division and conflict. </span><strong>This helps create work environments where everyone enjoys working instead of creating tense environments</strong><span>. </span></p><p><span>If you want to develop empathy, you need to cultivate understanding and let go of judgment.&nbsp;</span><strong>Judgment gets in the way of empathy</strong><span>. We judge other people because we don’t understand them enough and demand unfeasible things from them. However, we must understand that human beings are complex, and we cannot demand immediate change from them. A better approach is to understand where they are coming from and see what kind of help they need, if any.</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Understand.</strong><span>&nbsp;Focus on asking questions that help you understand the other person's perspective and refrain from judging. When you understand, empathy manifests, and you make other people feel good.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Let it breathe.&nbsp;</strong><span>Many of our conflicts arise from misunderstandings and heated arguments. If you hear something you don’t like when listening to another person, consider not addressing the issue while you are upset. Let it breathe. Sometimes, when you space your reaction, it loses its power, and you have the opportunity to see things with perspective—you could even realize you don’t understand and ask for further clarification. The key to empathy also lies in understanding your limitations.</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>When I think about Charisma, I think about a cup of coffee or tea. </strong><span>A cup of coffee irradiates heat by nature. It doesn’t have to do anything; it has the power to warm you up and make you feel cozy. </span></p><p><span>Charisma is just like that; you feel good when exposed to it. Likewise, if you can find a way to irradiate the warmth of charisma, you will make others feel good just by being present. If you establish a connection with another person or you build empathy, you are already irradiating the warmth of charism. If you want to take things to another level, </span><strong>you can also try to be kind and smile</strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Use kind speech. </strong><span>Sometimes, you may prioritize direct speech over kind speech. But please keep in mind that you can also be direct while being kind; you just need to find ways to communicate in a way that is mindful of the humanity of the person in front of you; </span><strong>treat the other person as if they were a guest you decided to host in your house</strong><span>—you probably wouldn’t be rude to someone you have let into your house. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Perform small acts of kindness.</strong><span> Small of kindness can go a long way. They can reduce stress and improve our emotional well-being—and the well-being of others [</span><a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/kindness-and-mental-health/random-acts-kindness" rel="">3</a><span>][</span><a href="https://www.ie.edu/center-for-health-and-well-being/blog/compassion-in-action-small-acts-of-kindness-that-make-a-big-difference/" rel="">4</a><span>]. Don’t underestimate the power of doing something good for the other person. It doesn’t have to be big—sometimes it can be as small as saying hi to someone you never say hi to, buying a cup of coffee for a co-worker, or just checking in with them.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Smile.&nbsp;</strong><span>Smile to other people, smile to yourself. In his book How to Smile, Thich Nhat Hanh states, “</span><em>Sometimes joy is the cause of your smile; sometimes your smile is the cause of your joy.</em><span>” Smiling relaxes you and the person in front of you. When talking to someone, always remind yourself to smile, even if it’s just a half-smile. A smile can go a long way.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Engineers are more than just a technical skill set; they are human beings immersed in human environments. Mastering&nbsp;</span><em>charisma</em><span>&nbsp;is a necessary human skill to develop for every engineer; </span><em><strong>charisma</strong></em><strong> is what sets great engineers apart</strong><span>. It’s how you can learn to meaningfully connect with other people, empathize, and uplift those around you by radiating warmth. When you do this, you become someone everyone enjoys working with, increasing your impact wherever you go.</span></p><p><strong>Please remember that&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>charisma</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;is not an innate trait but a set of learnable behaviors</strong><span>. You can transform not only your career but also your relationships and the environments you contribute to by developing your charisma. The choice is yours: remain solely technically proficient or become a more impactful version of yourself—one who fills every room they walk into with joy and makes other people feel good.</span></p><p><span>The journey of human development starts with small, deliberate steps. If you’re ready to explore further, I invite you to join me in the&nbsp;</span><strong>Underrated Soft Skills</strong><span>&nbsp;series. In this series, we will continue uncovering the skills that make engineers not just better professionals but better humans.</span></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charisma-Myth-Science-Personal-Magnetism/dp/1591845947" rel="">The Charisma Myth: How Anyone Can Master the Art and Science of Personal Magnetism</a><span> by Olivia Fox Cabane.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smile-Mindfulness-Essentials-Thich-Nhat/dp/1952692431" rel="">How to Smile</a><span> by Thich Nhat Hanh.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fight-Mindfulness-Essentials-Thich-Nhat/dp/1941529860" rel="">How to Fight</a><span> by Thich Nhat Hanh. </span></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><span>[1] </span><a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/being_present_increases_your_charisma" rel="">How Being Present Increases Your Charisma</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><span>[2] </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFTR-ueP9I" rel="">Why Having a Best Friend at Work Improves Engagement</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><span>[3] </span><a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/kindness-and-mental-health/random-acts-kindness" rel="">Random acts of kindness</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><span>[4] </span><a href="https://www.ie.edu/center-for-health-and-well-being/blog/compassion-in-action-small-acts-of-kindness-that-make-a-big-difference/" rel="">Compassion in action: small acts of kindness that make a big difference</a><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>The Utopian Engineering Society </span><strong>is an independent, free newsletter</strong><span>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During Pebble v1, I learned how much harder it is to build a great smartwatch experience on iPhone than it is on Android. It sounds like things have actually gotten worse over the last 8 years. </p><p>I want to set expectations accordingly. We will build a good app for iOS, but be prepared - there is no way for us to support all the functionality that Apple Watch has access to. It’s impossible for a 3rd party smartwatch to send text messages, or perform actions on notifications (like dismissing, muting, replying) and many, many other things.</p><p><img src="https://ericmigi.com/assets/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones-0-cleanshot_2025-03-12_at_12.07.462x.png" alt="Throwback to 2015"></p><p>Throwback to 2015</p><p>Here are the things that are harder or impossible for 3rd party smartwatches (ie non Apple Watches) to do on iPhone:</p><ul><li>There’s no way for a smartwatch to send text messages or iMessages.</li><li>You can’t reply to notifications or take ‘actions’ like marking something as done.</li><li>It’s very difficult to enable other iOS apps to work with Pebble. Basically iOS does not have the concept of ‘interprocess communication’(IPC) like on Android. What we did before was publish an SDK that other apps (like Strava) could integrate to make their own BLE connection to Pebble. It was a clunky quasi-solution that other apps didn’t like, because it was hard to test (among other things)</li><li>If you (accidentally) close our iOS app, then your watch can’t talk to app or internet</li><li>Impossible for watch to detect if you are using your phone, so your watch will buzz and display a notification even if you are staring at your iPhone</li><li>You can’t easily side load apps onto an iPhone. That means we have to publish the app on the iPhone appstore. This is a gigantic pain because Apple. Every update comes with the risk that a random app reviewer could make up some BS excuse and block the update.</li><li>Because of iOS Appstore rules, it would be hard for us to enable 3rd party watchface/app developers to charge for their work (ie we can’t easily make an appstore within our app)</li><li>Getting a <a href="https://pebble.github.io/rockyjs/">Javascript engine to run in PebbleOS</a> forced us to go through many hoops due to iOS — creating a compiler inside the Pebble iPhone app that in itself needed to be written in (cross-compiled to) JS to work with Apple's restriction on downloadable code can only be JS</li><li>As a Pebble watch/app developer, using the iOS app as relay to the watch sucks since the "developer mode" terminates every few minutes</li></ul><p>As an aside, back at Pebble, we went to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/23/9788146/pebble-time-quick-message-reply">crazy lengths</a> to find a way to let Pebble users to send text messages from Pebble. Our bizdev team did an impressive custom SMS-over-IP deal with AT&amp;T to enable this, but the end result was a pretty rough user experience (messages sent from Pebble didn’t appear in the Messages app on iPhone).</p><p><strong>Here’s the kicker</strong> - it sounds like the situation has actually <em><strong>gotten worse</strong></em>. This 2024 <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jnswire/jns-media/7d/b2/15969695/showtemp_83.pdf">class action lawsuit</a> against Apple states that: </p><ul><li>You must set notifications to display full content previews on your lockscreen for them to also be sent to a 3rd party watch (new restriction added in iOS 13).</li><li>Apple closed off the ability of smartwatches after Pebble to negotiate with carriers to
provide messaging services, and now requires users to turn off iMessage (disabling iOS’s core messaging platform) if they want to take advantage of such contracts between a third-party smartwatch maker and cellular carriers.</li></ul><h3><strong>Why are things so much harder on iOS?</strong></h3><p>Well, mostly because Apple systematically makes it nearly impossible for 3rd party wearable developers to build a smartwatch experience comparable to Apple Watch experience.</p><p>Apple claims their restrictions on competitors are only about security, privacy, crafting a better experience etc etc. At least that’s what they tell you as they tuck you into bed. I personally don’t agree - they’re clearly using their market power to lock consumers into their walled ecosystem. This causes there to be less competition, which increases prices and reduces innovation. DOJ seems to agree. For now at least…Tim Apple <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/03/tim-cook-apple-donate-1-million-trump-inauguration">paid $1m</a> to <a href="https://www.tuaw.com/2025/01/22/tech-leaders-attend-trumps-inauguration-with-tim-cook/">sit near Trump at the inauguration</a>, so who knows how long until Trump tells DOJ to drop the case. There’s also an Apple Watch class-action lawsuit working its way through the system.</p><h3><strong>But we’re going to try anyways</strong></h3><p>The problem is that 40% of everyone who signed up on <a href="http://repebble.com/">rePebble.com</a> still uses an iPhone. So we’re going to make a damn iOS app. I guess we’re gluttons for punishment. Just understand a few things:</p><ul><li>Our watch will&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;appear to have less developed functionality on iOS than Android. This is Apple’s fault, not ours.</li><li>Some features will appear first on our Android app, and then eventually we’ll add them to the iOS app. This is because the majority of our development team uses Android phones, and generally we’re building things for ourselves, so naturally Android comes first.</li><li>I don’t want to see any tweets or blog posts or complaints or whatever later on about this. I’m publishing this now so you can make an informed decision about whether to buy a new watch or not. If you’re worried about this, the easiest solution is to <strong>buy an Android phone</strong>.</li></ul><h3>You can help</h3><p>Apple will never change their ways unless you, the Pebble-curious iPhone user, complain loudly or switch to Android. Which is also hard because Apple tries it’s best to lock you into their platform.</p><p><strong>Are you an iPhone user who wants to use our watches?</strong> Start by posting a comment below this post. Hopefully there will be a lot - let’s show them that people actually want this to improve.</p><p>If you live in the US, tell your elected representatives to support legislation like ACCESS Act and AICO.</p><p>If you live in Europe, thank you for voting for representatives who passed the DMA. We will be <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/ios-interoperability/">petitioning Apple</a> under DMA Article 6 to request interoperability with Apple Watch APIs. </p></div></div>]]></description>

This enables all the baseline Pebble features like receiving notifications, timeline, watchfaces, alarms, timers, calendar, music control, basic fitness tracking, etc. </p><p>The really fun part is that most of the existing 10,000+ PebbleOS watchfaces and apps will immediately work on these new watches, though some may try to access web services that no longer exist.

Read more about on the <a href="https://developer.rebble.io/developer.pebble.com/blog/2016/10/11/Emery-SDK-Beta/index.html">old Pebble dev blog</a>.</p><p>We will publish a companion mobile app for Android and iOS. My friend and past Pebble colleague, Steve, recently joined us to lead this effort. He’s joining crc32, long-time <a href="https://github.com/pebble-dev/mobile-app/actions/runs/13609363513">Cobble</a> developer, who has been working with me since last summer. We’ll also be working on an updated SDK for creating new PebbleOS watchfaces or apps.</p><h2>Availability</h2><p>These watches will be sold exclusively through <a href="http://store.repebble.com/">store.rePebble.com</a>. Due to limited supply of display inventory, both watches will be manufactured in limited quantities. I highly recommend placing a pre-order - we will be manufacturing fewer watches than the number of people who have signed up on rePebble already! A pre-order secures your watch but gives you flexibility if you change your mind - you can get a full refund at any time up until your watch ships. </p><h2>Project Progress</h2><p><img src="https://ericmigi.com/assets/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches-6-group_6.png" alt="Left: Core 2 Duo running PebbleOS - Right: Engineering samples"></p><p>Left: Core 2 Duo running PebbleOS - Right: Engineering samples</p><p>Schedule-wise, <strong>Core 2 Duo</strong> is quite far along. We’ve already produced dozens of Core 2 Duo watches for testing and development. We’ve tested and confirmed our <a href="https://i.imgur.com/HwdTncx.mp4">button improvements</a>. PebbleOS has been compiled for the new architecture and runs on the watch. All firmware development is open source - you can follow the fun on <a href="https://github.com/pebble-dev/pebble-firmware/commits/main/">Github</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/221364737269694464/256091649996881922">Discord</a>. Our current schedule calls for shipments to begin in July. </p><p>How are we so far along, given that PebbleOS was only open-sourced in January? Two things helped: a) I took a monetary risk and began product development a bit earlier 😉,&nbsp;and b) we found a supplier who still had inventory of some Pebble 2 components. </p><p><video controls="" preload="metadata" playsinline=""><source src="https://ericmigi.com/assets/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches-10-outputjdis.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p><p>Core Time 2 display lighting up! </p><p>For <strong>Core Time 2</strong>, we’ve finished component selection, initial industrial and mechanical design, and found sources for long lead time components. Now, we’re in the middle of creating the first prototypes. </p><p>The grand irony of hardware development is that software development is usually the slowest part of the project. Not this time! We’re extraordinarily thankful to Google for open sourcing PebbleOS, which gave us a massive boost.</p><p>We’ll share more details (like Core Time 2 frame colour options) later this year, as we get closer to mass production. Our current schedule shows shipments beginning in December. Follow along on this <a href="https://ericmigi.com/">blog</a>, via <a href="https://repebble.com/signup">email</a>, on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ericmigi.com">Bluesky</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi">Twitter</a>.</p><h3>Why were these specific specifications selected?</h3><p>Building a smartwatch is an exhausting (😂) exercise of constraint maximization. Think of it as linear algebra - we’re solving multiple equations with multiple unknown variables. The primary constraint is display selection. This choice governs the size and shape of the physical design, as well as being the component with the most power drain and biggest cost. Other variables are Bluetooth chip (governs: cost, software compatibility, engineering time), factory selection (cost, quality, speed, risk), sensors (power, cost, software), battery (size, battery life, cost) and more!</p><p>Despite what Pebble’s second Kickstarter branding proclaimed, solving this inherently requires compromise. It’s a fine line to walk and generally the data is not 100% known upfront, so it inevitably requires some degree of trusting your gut. </p><p><strong>Touchscreen</strong>: we’re adding a touchscreen to Core Time 2. Why? Very specifically, I want to add the concept of ‘complications’ to watchfaces and widgets. Like on Apple Watch, these complications/widgets will show glanceable information like weather, next calendar event, step count, etc. The touch screen adds the ability to tap on the complication and directly open the associated app. This is much faster to use than opening an app via the button menu, and saves your quick launch (long-press on the buttons) for other apps. The touchscreen may be used for other interactions, like swiping to rapidly scroll down a list, but that will be lower priority. </p><p>Core Time 2 will be the first PebbleOS watch to ship with a touchscreen, but not the first that we designed! In 2015, Pebble designed it into a watch called Cutts (or C2) and did some (very) preliminary software development work to integrate a touchscreen into PebbleOS.</p><p><strong>Battery life</strong>: I’m really excited that battery life will be increased from 7 days to 1 month! This is due to massive improvements in Bluetooth chip power efficiency over the last 10 years. </p><p><strong>Speaker</strong>: we’re adding this primarily for potential use in apps that benefit from audio output, like a ChatGPT or other AI agent app. It can’t easily be used for making voice calls, since the watches will not support Bluetooth Classic (required for headset profiles), but theoretically someone could write a custom voice calling client (eg SIP or something).</p><p><strong>Smartstraps</strong>: neither watch will support smartstraps. Sorry. Most people don’t even remember this feature even existed, which is kinda the answer to why it will not be supported. RIP.</p><h3>You shouldn’t get one if…</h3><p><strong>You need a perfectly polished smartwatch.</strong> This project is a labour of love rather than a startup trying to sell millions of watches. There may be some rough edges (literally). Things will get delayed. Some features will not be ready at launch. Things could break. Things could not last as long as you’d like. The only thing we can guarantee is that it will be awesome and a lot of fun! Every time you look down at your watch, you will smile 🙂</p><p><strong>You’re looking for a fitness or sports watch</strong>. That’s not what we’re making. From what we hear, Garmin watches are great for runners/cyclists/triathletes!   </p><p><strong>You’re comparing this to an Apple Watch</strong>. There is NO way for a 3rd party smartwatch to compete with Apple Watch. Apple restricts 3rd parties in major ways - read <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones">my blog post</a> for more information. For example, 3rd party watches on iOS cannot send replies to notifications.   </p><p>These watches are not made for everyone. We want to be upfront with you about what to expect. </p><blockquote><p>Watch images above feature impeccably designed watchfaces from <a href="https://ttmm.is/pebble/">TTMM</a>, including one of my all-time favourites - <a href="https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/57812aa56c21044501000ed5?query=ttmm&amp;section=watchfaces">TTMMBRN</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>By <!-- -->Nick Van Wiggeren<!-- --> | <time datetime="2025-03-18">March 18, 2025</time></p><p>PlanetScale has deployed millions of Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes across the world. We create and destroy tens of thousands of them every day as we stand up databases for customers, take backups, and test our systems end-to-end. Through this experience, we have an unique viewpoint into the failure rate and mechanisms of EBS, and have spent a lot of time working on how to mitigate them.</p><p>In complex systems, failure isn’t a binary outcome. Cloud native systems are built without single paths of failure, but partial failure can still result in degraded performance, loss of user-facing availability, and undefined behavior. Often, minor failure in one part of the stack appears as a full failure in others.</p><p>For example, if a single instance inside of a multi-node distributed caching system runs out of networking resources, the downstream application will interpret error cases as cache misses to avoid failing the request. This will overwhelm the database when the application floods it with queries to fetch data as though it was missing. In this, a partial failure at one level results in a full failure of the database tier, causing downtime.</p><h2 id="defining-failure"><a href="#defining-failure">Defining Failure</a></h2><p>While full failure and data loss is very rare with EBS, “slow” is often as bad as “failed”, and that happens much much more often.</p><p>Here’s what “slow” looks like, from the AWS Console:</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://planetscale-images.imgix.net/assets/ebs-volume-degrading-D7MtBxSa.png?auto=compress%2Cformat" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light), (prefers-color-scheme: no-preference)"><img alt="EBS Volume Degrading" height="781" loading="lazy" src="https://planetscale-images.imgix.net/assets/ebs-volume-degrading-D7MtBxSa.png?auto=compress%2Cformat" width="1600"></picture></p><p>This volume has been operating steadily for at least 10 hours. AWS has reported it at 67% idle, with write latency measuring at single-digit ms/operation. Well within expectations. Suddenly, at around 16:00, write latency spikes to 200ms-500ms/operation, idle time races to zero, and the volume is effectively blocked from reading and writing data.</p><p>To the application running on top of this database: this is a failure. To the user, this is a 500 response on a webpage after a 10 second wait. To you, this is an incident. At PlanetScale, we consider this full failure because our customers do.</p><p>The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/general-purpose.html#gp3-ebs-volume-type">EBS documentation</a> is useful in helping us understand what promises AWS’ gp3 is able to make:</p><blockquote><p>When attached to an EBS–optimized instance, General Purpose SSD (gp2 and gp3) volumes are designed to deliver at least 90 percent of their provisioned IOPS performance 99 percent of the time in a given year</p></blockquote><p>This means a volume is expected to experience <em>under 90%</em> of its provisioned performance 1% of the time. That’s 14 minutes of every day or 86 hours out of the year of <em>potential</em> impact. This rate of degradation <em>far</em> exceeds that of a single disk drive or SSD. This is the cost of separating storage and compute and the sheer complexity of the software and networking components between the client and the backing disks for the volume.</p><p>In our experience, the documentation is accurate: sometimes volumes pass in and out of their provisioned performance in small time windows:</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://planetscale-images.imgix.net/assets/ebs-volume-short-blip-B86N4wvl.png?auto=compress%2Cformat" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light), (prefers-color-scheme: no-preference)"><img alt="EBS volume having a short blip" height="694" loading="lazy" src="https://planetscale-images.imgix.net/assets/ebs-volume-short-blip-B86N4wvl.png?auto=compress%2Cformat" width="1542"></picture></p><p>However, these short windows are enough to have impact on real-time workloads:</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://planetscale-images.imgix.net/assets/database-blip-ebs-CFXXjXsh.png?auto=compress%2Cformat" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light), (prefers-color-scheme: no-preference)"><img alt="Database blip due to EBS" height="623" loading="lazy" src="https://planetscale-images.imgix.net/assets/database-blip-ebs-CFXXjXsh.png?auto=compress%2Cformat" width="1547"></picture></p><p>Production systems are not built to handle this level of sudden variance. When there are no guarantees, even overprovisioning doesn’t solve the problem. If this were a once-in-a-million chance, it would be different, but as we’ll discuss below, that is far from the case.</p><h2 id="the-true-rate-of-failure"><a href="#the-true-rate-of-failure">The True Rate of Failure</a></h2><p>At PlanetScale, we see failures like this on a daily basis - the rate of failure is frequent enough that we’ve built systems that monitor EBS volumes directly to minimize impact.</p><p>This is not a secret, it's from the documentation. AWS doesn’t describe how failure is distributed for gp3 volumes, but in our experience it tends to last 1-10 minutes at a time. This is likely the time needed for a failover in a network or compute component.</p><p>Let's assume the following: Each degradation event is random, meaning the level of reduced performance is somewhere between 1% and 89% of provisioned, and your application is designed to withstand losing 50% of its expected throughput before erroring. If each individual failure event lasts 10 minutes, every volume would experience about 43 events per month, with at least 21 of them causing downtime!</p><p>In a large database composed of many shards, this failure compounds. Assume a 256 shard database where each shard has one primary and two replicas: a total of 768 gp3 EBS volumes provisioned. If we take the 50% threshold from above, there is a 99.65% chance you have at least one node experiencing a production-impacting event at any given time.</p><p>Even if you use io2, which AWS sells at 4x to 10x the price, you’d still be expected to be in a failure condition roughly one third of the time in any given year on just that one database!</p><p>To make matters worse, we also see these frequently as correlated failure inside of a single zone, even using <code>io2</code> volumes:</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://planetscale-images.imgix.net/assets/correlated-ebs-failure-BcoLdHtC.png?auto=compress%2Cformat" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light), (prefers-color-scheme: no-preference)"><img alt="Correlated EBS Failure" height="580" loading="lazy" src="https://planetscale-images.imgix.net/assets/correlated-ebs-failure-BcoLdHtC.png?auto=compress%2Cformat" width="1600"></picture></p><p>With enough volumes, the rate of experiencing EBS failure is 100%: our automated mitigations are consistently recycling underperforming EBS volumes to reduce customer-impact, and we expect to see multiple events on a daily basis.</p><p>That’s the true rate of failure of EBS: it’s constant, variable, and all by design. Because there are no performance guarantees when volumes are not operating to their specifications, it is extremely difficult to plan around for workloads that require consistent performance. You can pay for additional nines, but with enough drives over a long enough timeframe, failure is guaranteed.</p><h2 id="handling-failure"><a href="#handling-failure">Handling Failure</a></h2><p>At PlanetScale, our mitigations have clamped down on the expected maximum time for an impact window. We monitor metrics such as read/write latency and idle % closely, and we've even developed basic tests like making sure we can write to a file. This allows us respond quickly to performance issues, and ensures that an EBS volume isn’t ‘stuck’.</p><p>When we detect that an EBS volume is in a degraded state using these heuristics, we can perform a zero-downtime reparent in seconds to another node in the cluster, and automatically bring up a replacement volume. This doesn’t reduce the impact to zero, as it’s impossible to detect this failure before it happens, but it does ensure the majority of the cases don’t require a human to remediate and are over before users notice.</p><p>This is why we built <a href="https://planetscale.com/metal">PlanetScale Metal</a>. With a shared-nothing architecture that uses local storage instead of network-attached storage like EBS, the rest of the shards and nodes in a database are able to continue to operate without problem.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module-name="article-header" data-module-version="1.0.0" data-module-instance="default"><h2>The Hermit Kingdom, which intelligence agencies say was behind the $1.5 billion Bybit hack, faces “offramping” challenges due to the size of its hauls.</h2><p><span>Updated<!-- --> <!-- -->Mar 13, 2025, 2:59 p.m. <!-- --> UTC</span><span>Published<!-- --> <!-- -->Mar 7, 2025, 8:02 p.m. <!-- --> UTC</span></p></div><div data-module-name="article-body" data-module-version="1.0.0" data-module-instance="default"><p>How does North Korea launder its crypto loot?</p><p>Each time the Hermit Kingdom successfully hacks a company or protocol — like when it pillaged $1.5 billion from <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/04/bybit-says-77-of-stolen-funds-from-record-usd1-4b-hack-still-traceable">crypto exchange Bybit</a> on Feb. 21 — it faces the significant challenge of offramping its assets.</p><p>It cannot simply send the funds to a major exchange like Binance or Coinbase, because such firms implement Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks and work in conjunction with law enforcement agencies to freeze illegally-obtained funds as soon as they’re deposited on their platforms.</p><p>Instead, North Korea uses a well-developed network of over-the-counter (OTC) brokers to launder the stolen funds, according to Ari Redbord, global head of policy at blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs.</p><p>“They'll look to exchanges globally that don't have compliance controls in place,” Redbord, a former senior advisor to the Deputy Secretary and the Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence at the U.S. Treasury, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Everyone uses Chinese money laundering organizations. The cartels use them to move funds. There’s a network there that North Koreans have used for years.”</p><p>“But it’s not just China. Look around the world at places where you have no regulation or a lack of money laundering controls. Russia has been like a money laundering state for a very long time. There's tons of dark net market activity and ransomware actors that are related to Russia. North Korea has also used casinos in Macau to launder fiat.”</p><h2>Off-ramping billions</h2><p>To the best of our knowledge, North Korea has never used crypto to pay for things on the international scene. Instead, it tries to convert the tokens into government-issued currencies like the Chinese renminbi or the U.S. dollar, Redbord said.</p><p>But off-ramping billions in value isn’t easy. North Korea <a target="_blank" href="https://www.trmlabs.com/post/the-bybit-hack-following-north-koreas-largest-exploit">has stolen</a> more than $5 billion since 2017, according to TRM. Broken down on a per-month basis, that means that North Korea has needed to offramp at least $51 million per month on average — which is way too much for its money laundering network’s capabilities.</p><p>“You're inevitably seeing these funds sit in wallets over long periods of time. I don't think that's them setting up a strategic reserve of some kind; they’re just not being able to off-ramp the funds,” Redbord said. “In every world, North Korea wants to get those funds off-chain as fast as they can.”</p><p>“It’s so much money. Think about Pablo Escobar — he had this huge problem with storing cash. He didn’t know where to put it all,” Redbord added. “That's what North Korea has with crypto right now.”</p><p>In the Bybit hack’s case, the vast majority of the stolen ETH has already been bridged to Bitcoin via THORchain, a cross-chain liquidity protocol that enables permissionless crypto swaps.</p><p>The haul is now being fed through mixers (protocols that allow users to obfuscate their transactions on the blockchain) like Wasabi and CryptoMixer. These platforms typically process no more than $10 million a day, meaning that North Korea faces potential bottlenecks even before trying to offramp its stolen funds through OTC brokers. “Whether these mixers can continue to absorb the amount of money at play is an open question,” TRM <a target="_blank" href="https://www.trmlabs.com/post/bybit-hack-update-north-korea-moves-to-next-stage-of-laundering">said</a> in a recent report.</p><h2>What happens afterwards?</h2><p>Once funds are offramped through OTC brokers, the trail goes cold for blockchain analysis firms like TRM, but not necessarily for governmental agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) or IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), which each have a broad panoply of intelligence-gathering tools at their disposal.</p><p>Such agencies may use human intelligence (interviews, interrogations and espionage) and signals intelligence (intercepting communications or gathering information from electronic devices) to boost their investigations.</p><p>These agencies are sometimes able to retrieve stolen funds. In the case of the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in 2021, the Department of Justice (DOJ) was eventually able to recover <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/07/federal-officials-recover-bitcoin-ransom-from-colonial-pipeline-attack">almost 85% of the bitcoin (BTC) ransom paid to Russian cybercriminal group Darkside</a>. It’s unclear how investigators obtained the hacking group’s private keys.</p><p>The network of Chinese shell companies that North Korea uses to launder funds — whether from crypto or other sources — is constantly being monitored by U.S. agencies in collaboration with Japanese and South Korean authorities, Redbord said. And getting funds laundered through the Chinese banking system doesn’t necessarily mean the game is won for North Korea.</p><p>Back in 2019, U.S. federal prosecutors <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/long-arm-us-law-patriot-act-anti-money-laundering-act-2020-and-foreign-banks">served subpoenas to three Chinese banks</a> in a North Korea money-laundering case. That would ordinarily be impossible because the U.S. government doesn’t have jurisdiction over the Chinese banking system, Redbord, who worked on the case, explained.</p><p>But a provision under the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/usa-patriot-act">USA PATRIOT Act</a> enables the practice under specific circumstances. If the foreign bank does not respond, the U.S. government is allowed to cut off the bank’s correspondent banking — essentially disconnecting the foreign bank from the U.S. banking system.</p><p>In that particular case, the Chinese banks eventually complied with the subpoena, Redbord said. But the strategy is hard to replicate because it requires serious political capital. “We’re talking about some of the biggest banks in the world. If you were to actually cut off correspondent banking from one of the major Chinese banks, it would not be good for the economy,” Redbord said. That’s why the Treasury Secretary and Attorney General need to sign off on this kind of strategy.</p><p>“If any administration would be willing to lean in a little bit, it would probably be this one,” Redbord said. “Issuing a subpoena to a small or mid-sized Chinese bank is probably something that would be worth doing. It does send a really strong message.”</p><p><strong><em>CORRECTION (March 13, 2025, 15:00 UTC):</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>The Bybit hackers did not bridge the majority of their funds from Ethereum to Bitcoin using THORSwap, as the article originally stated.

  <section>
              
                
                  <p data-block-key="a10r4">The news business isn’t just any business — it serves a vital role in our democracy, recognized by the First Amendment. But media outlets can’t serve that role if they’re bankrupt. And as a result, news readers often find themselves blocked by paywalls from reading important stories about government business.</p><p data-block-key="cvf2a">That experience is particularly frustrating for readers who are unable to access the groundbreaking investigative reports outlets like <a href="https://www.wired.com/">Wired</a> magazine have been publishing, particularly over the first couple months of the Trump administration. Fortunately, Wired has a solution — it’s going to <a href="https://view.newsletters.cnn.com/messages/1742302072850a6bb40ceb62e/raw?utm_source=cnn_Reliable+Sources+%E2%80%93+March+18%2C+2025&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;bt_ee=yRz8lyYTdmF5KL6oF7kNSxmAt7%2BvkjCBRdNCN%2BFRvyeUW5Nt0j27VZ%2BOJJ9QAAY4&amp;bt_ts=1742302072852">stop paywalling articles that are primarily based on public records</a> obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.</p><p data-block-key="v36m">This approach makes <a href="https://freedom.press/issues/journalists-post-public-records-without-paywalls/">a lot of sense</a> from the standpoint of civil duty. They’re called public records for a reason, after all. And access to public documents is more important than ever at this moment, with government websites and records disappearing, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency doing its best to operate outside the public’s view, and the National Archives in disarray.</p><p data-block-key="5g3bf">But some may argue that, from a business standpoint, not charging for stories primarily relying on public records automatically means fewer subscriptions and therefore less revenue. We disagree. Sure, the FOIA process is time- and labor-intensive. Reporters face stonewalling, baseless denials, lengthy appeals processes, and countless other obstacles and delays. Investigative reports based on public records are among the most expensive stories to produce and share with the public.</p><p data-block-key="3anle">And yes, publishers rely on subscriptions to cover those costs — which will only increase as a result of anti-press attacks by the Trump administration. But while some readers might not subscribe to outlets that give away some of their best journalism for free, it’s just as possible that readers will recognize this sacrifice and reward these outlets with more traffic and subscriptions in the long run.</p><p data-block-key="bjnup">We commend Wired for tipping the balance that all for-profit media outlets must strike between public interest and business more toward the public interest. We <a href="https://freedom.press/issues/journalists-post-public-records-without-paywalls/">hope others</a> will follow its lead (and shoutout to outlets like <a href="https://www.404media.co/welcome-to-404-media/">404 Media</a> that also make their FOIA-based reporting available for free).</p><p data-block-key="ap74o">We also hope those who stand to benefit from these outlets’ leadership (that’s you, reader) will do their part and subscribe if you can afford it. They’re not asking for an arm and a leg. Wired is <a href="https://www.wired.com/v2/offers/wira01013?source=Site_0_EDT_WIR_SUPERFAN_0_PressFreedom__ZZ">offering</a> digital subscriptions for $10 annually at the moment. You probably spent that on a mediocre sandwich this year.</p><p data-block-key="8j8k7">The Fourth Estate needs to step up and invest in serving the public during these unprecedented times. And the public needs to return the favor and support quality journalism, so that hopefully one day we can do away with those annoying paywalls altogether.</p><p data-block-key="akc29"><b><i>Editor’s note:</i></b> <i>Katie Drummond, global editorial director of Wired, is a board member at Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF).</i></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-node="ch78d0t3zn46">
		<p>Stamina usually has a physical and competitive connotation — those with greater stamina can outwork and outlast opponents.</p>
<p>While stamina is the ability to sustain focused effort despite pain or discomfort, you should also think of it as the ability to stay true to your values and commitments — to hold <a href="https://kupajo.com/do-the-right-things-quietly/">fidelity to a worthy purpose</a> — especially when it’s hard to do so.</p>
<p>Stamina, in this way, is not just the thing you deploy to <a href="https://kupajo.com/its-good-to-quiver-under-the-bar/">keep running when your legs have gone volcanic</a>. It’s contributing as part of a team that, let’s say, has posed a challenging experience for all involved. It’s returning for another go at a problem that has repeatedly turned your mind into oatmeal (the kind with that creepy skin after it’s been left out awhile). It’s being a patient parent or partner despite bone-deep exhaustion.</p>
<p>It’s the ability to chip away at goals despite a lack of visible progress. To hold focus and presence in a world incentivized to distract you. To stay patient. To be on time. To push through difficult material. To follow instructions or proceed without them. To keep an open mind and be willing to renew your perspective.</p>
<p>Stamina is one of the most universally useful traits you can develop — it’s a more broadly applicable advantage than things that are situationally useful, like strength, intelligence, speed, popularity, motivation, etc.</p>
<p>Maybe a smarter, more naturally gifted person can be sporadically brilliant, and solve a tough problem way faster than you. But you, with your staying power, can more capably and reliably solve the 100 problems that follow.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="page-wrapper">
                                            
                                            
<p>There were a lot of speculation over the past years about what the next cycle of AI development could be. Agents? Reasoners? Actual multimodality? </p>
<p>I think it's time to call it: the model is the product.</p>
<p>All current factors in research and market development push in this direction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generalist scaling is stalling. This was the whole message behind the release of GPT-4.5: capacities are growing linearly while compute costs are on a geometric curve. Even with all the efficiency gains in training and infrastructure of the past two years, OpenAI can't deploy this giant model with a remotely affordable pricing.</li>
<li>Opinionated training is working <em>much</em> better than expected. The combination of reinforcement learning and reasoning means that models are suddenly learning tasks. It's not machine learning, it's not base model either, it's a secret third thing. It's even tiny models getting suddenly scary good at math. It's coding model no longer just generating code but managing an entire code base by themselves. It's Claude playing Pokemon with very poor contextual information and no dedicated training.</li>
<li>Inference cost are in free fall. The recent optimizations from DeepSeek means that all the available GPUs could cover a demand of 10k tokens per day from a frontier model for… the entire earth population. There is nowhere this level of demand. The economics of selling tokens does not work anymore for model providers: they have to move higher up in the value chain.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also an uncomfortable direction. All investors have been betting on the application layer. In the next stage of AI evolution, the application layer is likely to be the first to be automated and disrupted.</p>
<h2>Shapes of models to come.</h2>
<p>Over the past weeks, we have seen two prime example of this new generation of models as a product: OpenAI's DeepResearch and Claude Sonnet 3.7.</p>
<p>I've read a lot of misunderstandings about DeepResearch, which isn't helped by the multiplication of open and closed clones. OpenAI has not built a wrapper on top of O3. They have <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/deep-research-system-card.pdf">trained an entirely new model</a>, able to perform search internally, without any external calls, prompts or orchestration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The model learned the core browsing capabilities (searching, clicking, scrolling, interpreting files) (…) and how to reason to synthetize a large number of websites to find specific pieces of information or write comprehensive reports through reinforcement learning training on these browsing tasks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DeepResearch is not a standard LLM, nor a standard chatbot. It's a new form of <em>research language model</em>, explicitly designed to perform search tasks end to end. The difference is immediately striking to everyone using it seriously: the model generate lengthy reports with consistent structure and underlying source analysis process. In comparison as Hanchung Lee <a href="https://leehanchung.github.io/blogs/2025/02/26/deep-research/">underlined</a> all the other DeepSearch, including the Perplexity and Google variant, are just your usual models with a few twists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google’s Gemini and Perplexity’s chat assistants also offer “Deep Research” features, but neither has published any literature on how they optimized their models or systems for the task or any substaintial quantitative evaluations (…) We will make an assumption that the fine-tuning work done is non-substantial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anthropic has been laying their current vision ever clearer. In December, they introduced a controversial but, to my mind, correct <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents">definition</a> of agent models. Similarly to DeepSearch, an agent has to perform the targeted tasks internally: they "dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks". </p>
<p>What most agent startups are currently building is not agents, it's workflows, that is "systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths." Workflows may still bring some value, especially for vertical adaptations. Yet, to anyone currently working in the big labs it's strikingly obvious that all major progress in autonomous systems will be through redesigning the models in the first place.</p>
<p>We had a very concrete demonstration of this with the release of Claude 3.7, a model primarily trained with complex code use cases in mind. All the workflow adaptation like Devin had a major boost on SWE benchmarks.</p>
<p>To give it another example done at a much smaller scale: at Pleias we're currently working on automating RAG. Current RAG systems are a lot of interconnected yet brittle workflows: routing, chunking reranking, query interpretation, query expansion, source contextualization, search engineering. With the evolving training tech stack, there is a real potential to bundle all theses processes in two separate yet interconnected models, one for data preparation and the other for search/retrieval/report generation. This requires an elaborated synthetic pipeline and entirely new reward functions for reinforcement learning. Actual training, actual research.</p>
<p>What all this all means in practice: displacing complexity. Training anticipates a wide range of actions and edge cases, so that deployment becomes much more simple. But in this process most of the value is now created and, likely in the end, captured by the model trainer. In short, what Claude aims to disrupt and replace the current workflows like this basic "agent" system from llama index:</p>
<p><img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/Pclanglais/course-material/resolve/main/llama_index.png" alt="Llama Index Basic Agent"></p>
<p>With this:</p>
<p><img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/Pclanglais/course-material/resolve/main/claude.png" alt="Claude Agent"></p>
<h2>Training or being trained on.</h2>
<p>To reassert: the big labs are not advancing with an hidden agenda. While they can be opaque at time, they laying it all in the open: they will bundle, they will go up the application layer and they will attempt to capture most of the value there. And the commercial consequences are quite clear. Naveen Rao, the Gen AI VP of Databricks, <a href="https://x.com/NaveenGRao/status/1886544584588619840">phrased it quite well</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>all closed AI model providers will stop selling APIs in the next 2-3 years. Only open models will be available via APIs (…) Closed model providers are trying to build non-commodity capabilities and they need great UIs to deliver those. It's not just a model anymore, but an app with a UI for a purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what is happening right now is just a lot of denial. The honeymoon period between model providers and wrappers is over. Things could evolve in both direction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Claude Code and DeepSearch are early technical and product experiments in this direction. You will notice that DeepSearch is not available through an API, only used to create value for the premium subscriptions. Claude Code is a minimalistic terminal integration. Weirdly enough, while Claude 3.7 works perfectly in Claude Code, Cursor struggles with it and I've already seen several high end users cancelling their subscriptions as a result. Actual LLM agents doesn't care about pre-existing workflows: they replace it.</li>
<li>The most high profile wrapper are now scrambling to become hybrid AI training companies. They do have some training capacities, though very little advertised. One of Cursor main assets is their small autocompletion model. WindSurf has their internal cheap code model, Codium. Perplexity always relied on home classifiers for routing and recently pivoted to train their own DeepSeek variant for search purposes.</li>
<li>For smaller wrappers, not much will change, except likely increased reliance on agnostic inference providers if the big labs entirely let go of this market. I do also expect to see much more focus on UI which is still dramatically underestimated, as even more generalist models are likely to bundle common deployment takss, especially for RAG.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short the dilemma for most successful wrappers is simple: training or being trained on. What they are doing right now is both free market research for the big labs but, even, as all outputs is ultimately generated through model providers, free data design and generation. </p>
<p>What will happen afterwards is anyone guess. Successful wrappers do have the advantage of knowing their vertical well and accumiulating a lot of precious user feedbacks. Yet, in my experience, it's easier to go down from the model to application layers than building an entirely new training capacities from scratch. Wrappers may not have been helped by their investors either. From what I overheard, there is such a negative polarization against training, they almost have to hide what is going to be their most critical value: neither cursor small nor codium are properly documented at this moment.</p>
<h2>Reinforcement learning was not priced in.</h2>
<p>This brings me to the actual painful part: currently all AI investments are correlated. Funds are operating under the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The real value lay exclusively in an application layer independent from the model layer that is best positioned to disrupt existing market.</li>
<li>Model providers will only sell tokens at an ever lowering price, making wrappers in turn more profitable.</li>
<li>Close models wrapping will satisfy all the existing demands, even in regulated sectors with long lasting concerns over external dependencies.</li>
<li>Building any training capacity is just a waste of time. This does not include only pre-training but all forms of training.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm afraid this increasingly look like an adventurous bet and an actual market failure to accurately price the latest technical developments, especially in RL. In the current economic ecosystem, venture funds are meant to find uncorrelated investments. They will not beat S&amp;P500 but that's not what larger institutional investors are looking for: they want to bundle risks, ensure that in a bad year at least some things will work out. Model training is like a textbook perfect example for this: lots of potential for disruption in a context where most western economies are on course for a recession. And yet model trainers can't raise, or at least not in the usual way. Prime Intellect is one of the few new western ai training companies that has a clear potential to become a frontier lab. Yet, despite their achievements including the training of the first decentralized LLM, they struggled to raise more than your usual wrapper.</p>
<p>Beyond that, aside from the big lab, the current training ecosystem is very tiny. You can count all theses companies on your hands: Prime Intellect, Moondream, Arcee, Nous, Pleias, Jina, the HuggingFace pretraining team (actually tiny)… Along with a few more academic actors (Allen AI, Eleuther…) they build and support most of the current open infrastructure for training. In Europe, I know that at least 7-8 LLM projects will integrate the Common Corpus and some of the pretraining tools we developed at Pleias — and the rest will be fineweb, and likely post-training instruction sets from Nous or Arcee. </p>
<p>There is something deeply wrong in the current funding environment. Even OpenAI senses it now. Lately, there was some <a href="https://x.com/khoomeik/status/1892743475843813680">felt irritation</a> at the lack of "vertical RL" in the current Silicon Valley startup landscape. I believe the message comes straight from Sam Altman and will likely result in some adjustment in the next YC batch but pinpoint to a larger shift: soon the big labs select partners won't be API customers but associated contractors involved in the earlier training stage. </p>
<p>If the model is the product, you cannot necessarily build it alone. Search and code are easy low hanging fruits: major use cases for two years, the market is nearly mature and you can ship a new cursor in a few months. Now many of the most lucrative AI uses cases in the future are not at this advanced stage of development — typically, think about all these rule based system that still rule most of the world economy… Small dedicated teams with a cross-expertise and a high level of focus may be best positioned to tackle this— eventually becoming potential acquihire once the initial ground work is done. We could see the same pipeline in the UI side. Some preferred partner, getting exclusive API access to close specialized models, provided they get on the road for business acquisition.</p>
<p>I haven't mentioned DeepSeek, nor Chinese labs so far. Simply because DeepSeek is already one step further: not model as a product, but as a universal infrastructure layer. Like OpenAI and Anthropic, Lian Wenfeng <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kANyEjDDFWkhSKbcK/two-interviews-with-the-founder-of-deepseek">lays his plans in the open</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe that the current stage is an explosion of technological innovation, not an explosion of applications (…) If a complete upstream and downstream industrial ecosystem is formed, then there is no need for us to make applications ourselves. Of course, there is no obstacle for us to make applications if needed, but research and technological innovation will always be our first priority.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this stage, working only on applications is like "fighting the next wars with last war generals". I'm afraid we're at the point where many in the west are not even aware the last war is over.</p>

  <article>
    <p>Over the past few months, instead of working on our priorities at SourceHut, I
have spent anywhere from 20-100% of my time in any given week mitigating
hyper-aggressive LLM crawlers at scale. This isn’t the first time SourceHut has
been at the wrong end of some malicious bullshit or paid someone else’s
externalized costs – every couple of years someone invents a new way of ruining
my day.</p>
<p>Four years ago, we decided to <a href="https://man.sr.ht/ops/builds.sr.ht-migration.md">require payment to use our CI services</a>
because it was being abused to mine cryptocurrency. We alternated between
periods of designing and deploying tools to curb this abuse and periods of
near-complete outage when they adapted to our mitigations and saturated all of
our compute with miners seeking a profit. It was bad enough having to beg my
friends and family to avoid “investing” in the scam without having the scam
break into my business and trash the place every day.</p>
<p>Two years ago, we threatened to <a href="https://sourcehut.org/blog/2023-01-09-gomodulemirror/">blacklist the Go module mirror</a> because for
some reason the Go team thinks that running terabytes of git clones all day,
every day for every Go project on git.sr.ht is cheaper than maintaining any
state or using webhooks or coordinating the work between instances or even just
designing a module system that doesn’t require Google to DoS git forges whose
entire annual budgets are considerably smaller than a single Google engineer’s
salary.</p>
<p>Now it’s LLMs. If you think these crawlers respect robots.txt then you are
several assumptions of good faith removed from reality. These bots crawl
everything they can find, robots.txt be damned, including expensive endpoints
like git blame, every page of every git log, and every commit in every repo, and
they do so using random User-Agents that overlap with end-users and come from
tens of thousands of IP addresses – mostly residential, in unrelated subnets,
each one making no more than one HTTP request over any time period we tried to
measure – actively and maliciously adapting and blending in with end-user
traffic and avoiding attempts to characterize their behavior or block their
traffic.</p>
<p>We are experiencing dozens of brief outages per week, and I have to review our
mitigations several times per day to keep that number from getting any higher.
When I do have time to work on something else, often I have to drop it when all
of our alarms go off because our current set of mitigations stopped working.
Several high-priority tasks at SourceHut have been delayed weeks or even months
because we keep being interrupted to deal with these bots, and many users have
been negatively affected because our mitigations can’t always reliably
distinguish users from bots.</p>
<p>All of my sysadmin friends are dealing with the same problems. I was asking one
of them for feedback on a draft of this article and our discussion was
interrupted to go deal with a new wave of LLM bots on their own server. Every
time I sit down for beers or dinner or to socialize with my sysadmin friends
it’s not long before we’re complaining about the bots and asking if the other
has cracked the code to getting rid of them once and for all. The desperation in
these conversations is palpable.</p>
<p>Whether it’s cryptocurrency scammers mining with FOSS compute resources or
Google engineers too lazy to design their software properly or Silicon Valley
ripping off all the data they can get their hands on at everyone else’s expense…
I am sick and tired of having all of these costs externalized directly into my
fucking face. Do something productive for society or get the hell away from my
servers. Put all of those billions and billions of dollars towards the common
good before sysadmins collectively start a revolution to do it for you.</p>
<p>Please stop legitimizing LLMs or AI image generators or GitHub Copilot or any of
this garbage. I am begging you to stop using them, stop talking about them, stop
making new ones, just <em>stop</em>. If blasting CO<sub>2</sub> into the air and
ruining all of our freshwater and traumatizing cheap laborers and making every
sysadmin you know miserable and ripping off code and books and art at scale and
ruining our fucking democracy isn’t enough for you to leave this shit alone,
what is?</p>
<p>If you personally work on developing LLMs et al, know this: I will never work
with you again, and I will remember which side you picked when the bubble
bursts.</p>
