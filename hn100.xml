    <p>Yesterday was Darwin Day, marking the 205th anniversary of the great naturalist’s birth on February 12, 1809. One of the great things about Darwin is that a huge amount of his work is digitized and freely available via sites like <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/">Darwin Online</a>.</p>

<p>Interested browsers can also check out the <a href="http://darwin.amnh.org/browse.php?mode=uc&amp;id=72001">Darwin Manuscripts Project</a>, a collaborative initiative based at the American Museum of Natural History. Here you can read through Darwin’s personal notes, including gems like his <a href="http://darwin.amnh.org/viewer.php?eid=15156&amp;mode=clean">scratched out book title ideas</a>. There are also a number of nature drawings that Darwin prepared while writing his masterpiece, <em>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</em> (1859). Here, for example, is Darwin’s rather skillful drawing of the stamen of a <em>Strelitizia</em> flower:</p>

  </p>
</div>

<p>But there are other drawings in Darwin’s papers that defy explanation - until we remember that Darwin and his wife Emma (who, famously, was also his cousin) had a huge family of ten children. Scholars believe that a young Francis Darwin, the naturalist’s third oldest son, drew this on the back of Darwin’s manuscript for <em>On the Origin of Species</em>.</p>

<p>Remarkably, this is one of only twenty-eight pages of the manuscript that still exist. The Cambridge University Library has given it the descriptive name “The Battle of the Fruit and Vegetable Soldiers,” and so indeed it seems to be. As near as I can make out, it shows a turbaned soldier mounted on a blueberry squaring off with an English dragoon on a carrot-steed. Perhaps inspired by the 1839-1842 Anglo-Afghan War, and filtered through the Darwin household’s fascination with plants and gardening?</p>

<p>Here’s another drawing from the talented Darwin children, this one seemingly directly inspired by their father’s work. Birds are in the act of catching a spider and a gnat or bee, while flowers and a butterfly appear in remarkable detail. Clearly the family had a knack for acute observations of nature (in fact young Francis ended up becoming a naturalist as well).</p>

<p>Fascinatingly, this image might be detailed enough that it actually depicts Darwin’s famous <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.1&amp;pageseq=132">sandwalk</a>, his “thinking path” that led to the family greenhouse (which is, perhaps, the structure visible at the end of the path). The area was later made into a playground for the Darwin children.</p>

<p>I poked around the items available at Darwin Online and came across <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/EmmaDiaries.html">Emma Darwin’s diaries</a>, which are a fascinating resource. Emma seems to have been a talented sketch artist in her own right, doodling profiles and faces in over her daily schedule:</p>

<p>Amazingly, the Darwin kids even got into Emma’s diary, with several pages rendered unreadable by what is almost certainly a crazed toddler’s pencil. In fact, the back page of Emma’s potential self-portrait was defaced in precisely this way:</p>

<p>It’s all a great reminder that even legendary scientists had family lives, and that when we think about history, it’s important to remember that famous figures weren’t working in isolation. They were surrounded by far less famous friends, family members, acquaintances, and enemies. And sometimes, when we get lucky, we see some of their artifacts from the past too.</p>

<p>A tip of the hat, by the way, to <a href="http://www.openculture.com/">Open Culture</a>, a website that we’re avid fans of and which wrote the original post about the Darwin kids’ drawings that brought them to our attention. Also be sure to check out <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/">Darwin Online</a> and the <a href="http://darwin.amnh.org/">Darwin Manuscripts Project</a>, two wonderful resources for anyone interested in the naturalist and his times.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I also wanted to include a short note on Annie Darwin, who died from tuberculosis at age ten and was Charles’ favorite child (or so he <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=6ikIAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22the+apple+of+her+proud+father%27s+eye,+his+favourite+child,%22&amp;dq=%22the+apple+of+her+proud+father%27s+eye,+his+favourite+child,%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ewj9Uu3tLqbQ2wXYjoDICg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ">told</a> his cousin). This box of items relating to Annie’s life that was collected by Emma Darwin offers another, sadder testimony to the tight-knit dynamic of the Darwin family, and to their artistic knack. Annie’s pink flowers in careful needlepoint seem to echo the exuberant nature drawings of her siblings:</p>

</div>

<p>Darwin wrote about Annie after her death with touching earnestness as he tried to set down his memories of her before they faded:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our poor child, Annie, was born in Gower St on March 2d. 1841. &amp; expired at Malvern at1 Midday on the 23d. of April 1851.— I write these few pages, as I think in after years, if we live, the impressions now put down will recall more vividly her chief characteristics. From whatever point I look back at her, the main feature in her disposition which at once rises before me is her buoyant joyousness.</p>

  </p>
</div>

<p>In his book <em>Annie’s Box: Charles Darwin, His Daughter And Human Evolution,</em> Randal Keynes argues that Darwin’s scientific thought was closely entangled with his family life, and that the death of Annie just before Easter in 1851 spelled the end of Darwin’s already weakening Christian faith. Students of the past are often leery of making overly explicit and binary links between work and life (I remember being amazed when I learned that Shakespeare’s son Hamnet died several years before he wrote <em>Hamlet,</em> and that literary scholars don’t make more hay with that fact). But if nothing else, it again reminds us that when historical figures become legendary icons, they lose much of the context that makes them human to us at the remove of decades or centuries.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-component="">
      <p>Imagine having never ridden a broom with the <em>chosen one</em> they call Harry Potter, or stumbled through a closet and into the mystical land of Narnia. For kids that discover the magic of reading through books like <em>Harry Potter</em> or <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>, reading is a gateway to otherworldly realms where your only limitation is your imagination. But, reading isn’t easy for everyone. It’s estimated that 1 in 10 people have some form of dyslexia, often undiagnosed. Children with dyslexia struggle with simple reading tasks like sounding out words, making it difficult for them to read.</p>
<p>To help young readers of all skill levels, we’re introducing Kermit, a child-friendly typeface created by the type design studio <span><a href="https://underware.nl/">Underware</a></span>. Kermit is a friendly and approachable font that encourages children of all skill levels to read, even if they are anxious about their abilities. It is a powerful example of just how much design decisions matter: Associating boldness and letter widths with verbal inflections could improve a child’s comprehension, or employing Variable Fonts for animation may help severe dyslexics start their reading journey. Combining science and design creativity can improve a child’s confidence in reading, changing their trajectory in life. Kermit is, therefore, more than just a typeface, it is a platform for exploring new, science-based methods of helping children read.</p>
<p>Learning to read is difficult: the process involves nearly every part of your brain, and you have to train for years to do it effortlessly. For some people, though, reading can be like navigating a confusing highway filled with detours. Children who struggle to read often have low self-esteem and give up, limiting their creative potential and intellectual curiosity. Any help we can give children can be huge – even if it’s simply making words look more friendly.</p>
    </div><div data-block-component="">
      <h2>Designing for early readers</h2>
<p>Ever had your mood lifted, your burdens lightened, and your confidence boosted by someone’s encouraging words, or a stranger’s smile? We’ve all experienced that boost and science proves it. Being in a <a href="https://microsoft.design/articles/the-hidden-power-of-typography/">good mood</a> improves our performance on creative cognitive tasks.</p>
<p>For Underware designers Bas Jacobs, Akiem Helmling, and <span><a href="https://underware.nl/about_us/sami">Sami Kortemäki</a></span>, making Kermit fun and playful was a way to put kids in a good mood, making them interested in reading. Therefore, the design had to be informal and relatable like handwriting.</p>
    </div><div data-block-component="">
      <p>Kermit was designed for children to easily read, making legibility a priority. Underware imbued Kermit with a large x-height, thick strokes, generous spacing, and familiar letter shapes, striking a perfect balance between the informality of handwriting fonts and the structure and readability of classic book typefaces like Garamond or Avenir.</p>
<p>Making Kermit enjoyable—and with support for 426 languages based on Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets—is good but we wanted to do more by trying new ideas coming out of the scientific community. Take a look at the <span><a href="https://kermit-font.com/">online specimen site</a></span> for more details on Kermit’s design.</p>
<h2>Showing how to read expressively</h2>
<p>Remember when you were a kid having to clean your room, mow the lawn, or maybe take out the garbage? You probably heard your parent or guardian ask one of the following questions:</p>
<p>Did you take out the <strong>garbage</strong>?<br>
Did <strong>you</strong> take out the garbage?<br>
<strong>Did</strong> you take out the garbage?</p>
<p>All three questions use the same words, yet they have different meanings. When we speak, we inflect our voice to add more meaning. You might make your voice louder, or pronounce a word slowly, or raise your pitch. These inflections are called prosody. Unfortunately, almost all prosody gets lost when we write because we have no notation for it.</p>
<p>Ever had an email misunderstanding because people couldn’t tell you were being ironic? That confusion doesn’t happen as much in conversation because prosody makes the irony clear.</p>
<p>Researcher Ann Bessemans wondered if there was a way to represent prosody in written text. She <span><a href="https://journals.uc.edu/index.php/vl/article/view/4653">found</a></span> that when you represent pitch, volume, and duration typographically, children read out loud more expressively, with correct prosody. She also <a href="https://journals.uc.edu/index.php/vl/article/view/4603"><span>found</span></a> that it even worked for children and adults who had hearing impairments. Even better, a preliminary, yet unpublished study is finding that adding prosody to text improves children’s comprehension.</p>
<p>Inspired by the possibility of helping kids read expressively and improve their comprehension, we designed Kermit to represent prosody: employing boldness to represent volume, width to represent duration, and shifts letters vertically to represent pitch. It looks unconventional, but once you get used to it, it’s easy to read text and hear all the nuance that a performer would add.</p>
    </div><div data-block-component="">

    
    <p>Great oratory is very expressive. When we caption videos such as President John F. Kennedy’s inaugural speech using conventional text, all his passion is lost in translation. Adding prosody to the captions enables you to experience the full power of the performance—even if you have a hearing impairment and can’t hear a single word.</p>

    
  </div><div data-block-component="">
      <p>While we haven’t implemented automatic prosody yet, Kermit allows us to explore expressive writing to elevate comprehension for children and adults alike.</p>
<h2>Helping severe dyslexics</h2>
<p>Dyslexia is a very active area of research. Fifty years ago, people thought dyslexics saw letters backwards. Now, it’s primarily seen as a phonological problem in which dyslexics have difficulty with sounds in language. The most successful dyslexia programs to date focus on teaching phonemic awareness (e.g. that the spoken word “cat” has three sounds) and phonics (mapping letters to sounds). This success might make it seem like dyslexia is all about sounds, but it’s not clear yet if phonological problems are dyslexia’s <em>cause</em>.</p>
<p>In 2010, researchers Trichur Vidyasagar and Kristen Pammer suggested a new <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(09)00283-6">theory</a> on the cause of dyslexia: dyslexic brains might have issues with visuo-spatial processing. In other words, dyslexic brains may process visual information differently, making the order of letters unclear and reading difficult.</p>
<p>To understand this, let’s take a trip inside your brain. Light enters your eyes and shines on the retina. The retina processes the light, sending neural signals on a long journey from your eyes to the back of your head where your brain processes images, forwarding them through the visual cortex.</p>
<p>This journey takes two parallel paths: the high road and the low road, literally. The high road, or dorsal pathway, physically runs along the top path through your brain, carrying information about where things are, such as the sky is up, pavement is down, or the order of letters on a page. It is the “where” signal.</p>
<p>The low road, or ventral pathway, runs below the high road, carrying information about what objects are, e.g. the blue thing is the sky, the grey thing, pavement, and the two lines leaning against each other with a crossbar is an A. It is the “what” signal.</p>
<p>These two roads meet at a little neural town called the Visual Wordform Area, which combines the “what” and “where” signals to form words—hence the name. This is where we recognize words.</p>
<p>This neural town has a big spotlight in it, controlled partially by signals from the high road. As we read, the spotlight should smoothly move from one letter to the next, focusing our attention on a letter from the low road, identifying it, then moving to the next. If anything goes wrong along the high road—and there are many things that can go wrong—the spotlight will not move smoothly or focus attention as well, disrupting reading.</p>
<p>According to Vidyasagar &amp; Pammer’s theory, dyslexics may have something wrong in their high road, weakening signals about letter locations. That in turn makes it hard to understand the order that letters are coming in on the low road, making it more challenging to recognize words.</p>
<p>This smooth spotlight movement is something we have to learn. Before we learn to read, our eyes and attention unconsciously flit about, painting a picture of our world. The more we read, the more we train our brain to control our spotlight smoothly. But, if a child can’t recognize words due to weak high road signals, they won’t read as much. The neurological systems needed for proficient reading won’t get exercised, but they will get exercised in neurotypical classmates who read more. The dyslexic child gets left behind.</p>
<p>When these systems are underdeveloped, a child may not develop strong phonological associations or smooth visual scanning (remember, our eyes and brains have to be trained to do this; it isn’t natural). The number of potential issues along the high road might explain the variety of dyslexia subtypes.</p>
<p>So, what does all of this have to do with a font?</p>
<p>The high road doesn’t just carry location information; it carries motion signals, too. Adding motion to letters might boost the high road signal, helping dyslexics get control of their spotlight of attention and improve their reading. To help, we created a special version of Kermit that is animated, with letters that draw themselves.</p>
<h2>A font that draws itself</h2>
<p>How do you create an animated font?</p>
<p>Because Kermit is built as a Variable Font, it is not limited to Light, Regular, or Bold styles. It can produce any level of boldness thanks to Variable Font technology.</p>
    </div><div data-block-component="">
      <p>But the technology isn’t just for typography. It can vary in color, style, or even change a letter’s shape over time, making the font animated.</p>
<p>The math behind Variable Fonts, called linear interpolation, makes animation awkward because points on the letter’s outline must move in a straight line at a constant speed. Natural-looking animation through curves needs to use a higher order of mathematics.</p>
    </div><div data-block-component="">
      <p><em>An animation showing the advantage of HOI interpolation versus linear interpolation. Press play to show the animation or use the slider to control it yourself.</em></p>
<p>As a workaround, you could move points along many tiny lines so they seem to flow around a curve naturally. That, however, would require designers to draw dozens of versions of each letter like cartoon animators of the 1930’s–1970’s, painstakingly drawing 24 pictures for every second of film.</p>
<p>Luckily, Kermit’s designers had a clever mathematical idea: to combine independent linear parts of a Variable Font to create higher order math. They call it Higher Order Interpolation, or HOI for short. (Fun fact: In the Netherlands, where Underware is based, “Hoi” means “Hi”).</p>
<p>That breakthrough enabled the designers to create smooth animations that accelerate, decelerate, and turn corners with the control of an old school animator, without having to draw thousands of pictures. This makes Kermit’s animation feel like it’s naturally drawing itself with a pen.</p>
    </div><div data-block-component="">
      <p>An animation showing how Kermit can draw itself smoothly using HOI and variable font technologies. Press play to start the animation or use the slider to control it yourself.</p>
<p>We hope this animation will strengthen the high road signal in dyslexics, helping them better understand letter order and more easily recognize words. That could enable them to spend more time reading and training the neural pathways for reading. We are still testing this idea and will release the animated version only when we can scientifically prove its benefits.</p>
<h2>Empowering children</h2>
<p>Writing systems, which are over 5,500 years old, are one of humanity’s greatest inventions. Like magic or telepathy, they transmit ideas and creativity across the globe and across generations. It is one of the ways that we express our humanity. Now, it’s time for an upgrade. Time to take advantage of our latest technologies and research to empower more children to read.</p>
<p>In designing a child-centric font for reading, we hope to support children learning to read while also making it more enjoyable, valuable, and accessible for <em>everyone</em> to read. We explore new frontiers with the animated version of Kermit, new methods of research-based expressiveness, and new ways of making reading look fun and easy to all kids, regardless of reading skill.</p>
<p>The power of reading sets a child’s imagination on fire, and no movie or technology can surpass the theater of the mind. Reading gives children agency and, ultimately, confidence. It impacts the trajectory of their lives, from their academic performance across subjects, to future job prospects, to their self-image and whether or not they feel incompetent or capable. Every child deserves the opportunity to thrive, and we are dedicated to trying ideas new and old to help them. We hope that this first release of Kermit is the next step on that journey.</p>
<p>The basic styles of Kermit (Regular, Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic) are available today in Office, with the remaining 38 styles arriving in early May. <span data-teams="true">If you want to try out the font online in the meantime, you can go to the demo site at <a id="menur72k" title="https://kermit-font.com/" href="https://kermit-font.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Link Kermit-font.com"><span>Kermit-font.com</span></a>.</span></p>

The surprising part of this story is not the release of a new “homebrew” game for a system released in 1985 — hobbyist computing has been visible since at least the 1970s — but that Tengen and its parent company, Atari Games, had disappeared 30 years ago after being crushed in court by Nintendo for doing exactly the same thing: manufacturing unauthorized cartridges for the NES.</p><p>This story isn’t just a curiosity — it highlights how the gaming industry, like many creative fields, is defined as much by legal and business decisions as by artistic vision. Behind every major shift, there’s a dance between engineers, lawyers, and business leaders, visible only to a few insiders. Nintendo’s lawyers, more than Mario, made Nintendo. Atari’s lawyers, more than ET — <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/31/530235165/total-failure-the-worlds-worst-video-game" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">notoriously the worst game of all time</a> — sealed its downfall.</p><p>To illustrate these points, let’s take a walk down memory lane with Atari and Nintendo. Press Rewind on that analog tape deck. The year is 1979. Atari is at the peak of its commercial success, but the mojo is gone. The freewheeling culture has been replaced by the Brioni suits and New York secretaries of new owner Warner. The existing industrial arrangement at the time was that of a bundled console-plus-cartridge business model, where the console manufacturer (say, Atari with its VCS/2600) sold the console at a loss and cross-subsidized it with the money made on cartridges sold with a huge profit margin.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Nintendo’s lawyers, more than Mario, made Nintendo. Atari’s lawyers, more than ET, sealed its downfall.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Except, the game designers were paid a flat salary, not royalties, unlike the rock stars in Warner’s stable. In late 1979, four defecting Atari designers and one music industry executive disrupted the video game console business model by aligning it with the recording industry’s: Hardware would be just hardware, and content would now be supplied by third-party content providers. Activision was formed, with a little business and legal help from the Sistine Chapel of Silicon Valley law firms, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati.</p><p>Atari sued Activision, slapping them with any legal argument Warner could come up with — theft of trade secrets, copyright infringement, trademark infringement, patent infringement — but nothing stuck. Activision’s business vision and legal team beat Atari’s. The floodgates of third-party game production opened, and the model remains the paradigm today.</p><p>Soon, however, the game market became saturated. Too many players for too small (at a time) a market meant it became impossible for most developers to scale and recoup their costs. Quality also dwindled, leading to customer dissatisfaction. To differentiate, some publishers released what <em>Videogaming &amp; Computer Illustrated</em> described as “enough to send the most liberal sexual enthusiast staring at his/her shoes in abashment,” leading to public outcry and a bad rep for the industry as a whole. In late 1983, the video game market crashed, leading to the collapse of both Atari and Activision.</p><div><figure><img decoding="async" width="419" height="717" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Worlds-Leading-Designers-of-Videogames.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Alan Miller, David Crane, Larry Kaplan, and Bob Whitehead, who became known as the “Gang of Four,” are prominently featured in Activision’s 1981 catalog. They left Warner’s company to form Activision, a company that would give programmers the freedom to create, and reward them both financially and with name recognition.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Enter NES. In 1985, Nintendo introduced the NES in North America. Three years later, competitor Sega introduced the Genesis (also known as the Mega Drive). Both companies had learned from the crash and took steps to prevent third-party developers from releasing unapproved games. Where Atari’s<em> legal </em>arguments had failed, they turned to an <em>engineering</em> strategy: A proprietary lock-out chip would be inserted in the console. A lock-out mechanism is an ensemble of software code that is burnt into two special-purpose chips. One is placed inside the console. That piece of software, embedded in silicon, looks for another piece of software, an unlocking key, which is itself burnt into another special-purpose chip added to the game cartridge. When a game cartridge that contains the key is inserted into the console, the key and the lock shake hands, and the key opens the lock.</p><p>The source code of the software embedded in both chips is kept secret by the console manufacturer. To keep the keys a trade secret, the console company burns them into the chips in a form that is understandable by machines but not by humans. To ensure even further protection of these secrets, both Nintendo and Sega manufactured the approved third-party game cartridges themselves, before selling them to the licensees who in turn distributed them through toy and computer stores. If I wanted to make a game for the NES, assuming I was one of the happy few to be vetted, I would deliver my game software code to Nintendo, who would add the secret key to it, burn the whole thing on a cartridge bearing my name, and hand that cartridge to me so I could then sell it through my own distribution circuit. Not efficient, but effective, as far as keeping the source code of the lock-out system a secret.</p><p>Many in the industry took umbrage with this model, in particular because it enabled the console manufacturers to impose what developers considered unfair business terms. Nintendo, in particular, was known to be a bully, and its behavior even led to anti-trust investigations by the U.S. government. But as every thief knows, every lock can be unlocked without the official key — it’s just a matter of time. In this case, that time was 1989.</p><p>The original Atari had been split after the crash, and Atari Games, doing business as Tengen, was now in the business of publishing games for various computers and consoles. But it didn’t want to be bound by Nintendo’s terms, and decided to publish unlicensed cartridges for the NES. After all, if the original Atari’s lawyers had been unable to prevent Activision from doing just the same thing for the VCS/2600, why would Nintendo’s lawyers be able to stop Atari Games?</p><p>Atari responded to engineering moves with a bolder engineering move. It reverse-engineered Nintendo’s lock-out chip, known as the “10NES,” and replaced it with its own, the “Rabbit.” The Rabbit code was entirely different from the 10NES, as far as 0s and 1s are concerned, but it was functionally similar. When a rogue Tengen cartridge was inserted into the NES, it would sing a mating song so close to what the lock expected from approved cartridges that the console would open up, and the two would play well together. The first rogue game would be “Tetris,” followed by such hits as “Super Sprint” and “Ms. Pac-Man.” On the Sega front, another third-party publisher, Accolade, started by two of the Activision founders, reverse-engineered the Genesis’ lock in 1991 for its game “Ishido” and quickly released a number of blockbusters for that platform.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="1187" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tengen-ad.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Tengen advertising its rogue NES games and noting that they are not endorsed by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Engineering responses to business disruption had been defeated by engineering means. In our never-ending dance, it was now time for lawyers to respond to reverse-engineering with <em>legal engineering</em> moves of their own. By legal engineering, I mean the craft of creating novel legal arguments in response to changes in an environment — in this case, technological change.</p><p>What the Nintendo and Sega lawyers noticed was that in the process of creating their own mischievous code, the one that confused the locks, Atari and Accolade had to make a temporary copy of the lock’s own original code (the 10NES and the TMSS) in order to analyze it and make an original, similarly functional code. That <em>intermediate copying</em> had not been authorized by either Nintendo or Sega. Atari and Accolade were therefore culpable of copyright infringement, the console manufacturers argued, making the distribution of the rogue games illegal.</p><p>The two cases, <em>Atari Games v. Nintendo</em>, and <em>Sega v. Accolade</em>, were tried in two different sets of courts for procedural reasons, but were ruled upon at the same time period and cross-referenced each other. The legal question was the same: Is intermediate copying of software code (the lock), when the sole purpose of such copying is to reverse engineer the lock and create a completely new and original code that will open the lock, illegal copyright infringement, even though the lock’s code is not at all present in the final product (the rogue key), or is this practice permissible under the <em>fair use</em> doctrine, since the code being temporarily copied is then discarded?</p><p>The underlying legal sub-questions were particularly complex, and both federal appeals court judges distilled their astute reasonings in clear ways, ultimately ruling that intermediate (temporary) copying of software code in the process of reverse-engineering it is generally permissible as fair use under copyright law. At the heart of their technical legal rulings was <em>economic policy</em>.</p><p>They focused on “the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work,” one of the Copyright Act’s fair use analysis factors, and noted that the public benefit of the copying at stake should also be factored in. In reference to the Accolade case, the judge concluded that “Accolade’s identification of the functional requirements for Genesis compatibility has led to an increase in the number of independently designed videogame programs offered for use with the Genesis console. It is precisely this growth in creative expression, based on the dissemination of other creative works and the unprotected ideas contained in those works, that the Copyright Act was intended to promote.” The judge rebuked any suggestion that Sega might suffer a loss when it came to the number of games it would itself sell (or not sell) as a result.</p><p>The Atari judge agreed: “When the nature of a work requires intermediate copying to understand the ideas and processes in a copyrighted work, that nature supports a fair use for intermediate copying,” he wrote. “Thus, reverse engineering object code to discern the unprotectable ideas in a computer program is a fair use.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>To the judge, it didn’t matter that Atari was right on principle — it had blatantly lied to get the code.</p></blockquote></figure><p>The pair of rulings had a significant impact on the industry at large, one still felt today. It would come to protect the distribution of software-based hardware emulators, such as the Connectix Virtual Game Station, which enables players to run Playstation games on their desktop computers. Perhaps even more visible as part of the retro-gaming boom of the past 30 years is the availability of a plethora of new, cheap hardware that enables nostalgic players to play the Nintendo, Atari, or Sega games of their youth without an actual NES, VCS, or Genesis, and, in many cases, without actual game cartridges either. Finally, the wide availability of new games for these old consoles developed by companies such as the new Tengen Games is enabled by the two rulings.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/zed-and-zee-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Screenshots from Tengen Games’s 2024 release “Zed and Zee.”</figcaption></figure><p>You might have been lured into reading this article by the promise of blood being drawn by Nintendo from Atari. But didn’t we just learn that Atari Games (Tengen) beat Nintendo in court?</p><p>No, and here’s the twist. The Atari court ruled that Atari <em>should</em> have been allowed to reverse-engineer the NES as a matter of principle, based on fair use. But, it continued, in this case, Atari was not allowed to invoke the fair use defense, because it came to court with <em>dirty hands</em>, so to speak. Atari’s lawyers’ hands were very dirty indeed. See, Atari’s engineers had actually failed to reverse engineer the 10NES. They could not figure out what that code was, so they couldn’t create a new code that would work with the console. So the lawyers took over and blatantly lied to the Copyright Office in order to obtain the copyrighted Nintendo code. That code was held at the Office under seal. In 1988, Atari’s lawyers filed an application stating that Atari was a defendant in a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by Nintendo, and needed a copy of the program to “be used only in connection with the specified litigation.” The Copyright Office obliged and provided the copy, as they are supposed to in this type of case. But the story was a lie. Nintendo was not suing Atari at the time. Atari then used Nintendo’s code to create the Rabbit code.</p><p>Upon hearing of the fraud, the judge turned to a maxim coined in British courts in 1728 and traced all the way to the Roman period of Justinian: <em>he who comes into equity must come with clean hands</em>. In modern language, to invoke a legal principle based on fairness, such as fair use, one must approach the bar in good faith. One who comes to court in bad faith (with “unclean hands”) will be denied a defense such as fair use.</p><p>As a result of its lawyers’ filthy hands, Atari was barred from manufacturing games for the NES. Nintendo, with its stronger legal team, subsequently “bled Atari to death,” in the words of Ed Logg, designer of Tengen’s version of “Tetris,” which was recalled by court order and is now an expensive rarity on eBay. The Tengen brand fell into disarray and was abandoned, only to be revived a year ago to do the very thing Atari had been precluded from doing because their lawyers had failed to wash their hands.</p><p>Many technology histories, including “ultimate” histories of the videogame industry that focus on “the great inventor,” are too reductive. To better understand inflection points, one must look beyond individual genius to the less sexy interplay of engineering, business, and law. Often, it’s the legal battles — and sometimes the lawyers themselves — that create significant forks in the road.</p><hr><p><strong><em>Julien Mailland</em></strong><em> is a technology industry attorney.

            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Between May 2023 and March 2025, Tract attempted to build a
              venture-backed company to address Britain’s housing crisis by
              improving the planning permission process. After raising a
              £744,000 pre-seed round in April 2024, we explored several
              business models: a site-sourcing tool for developers (Tract
              Source), a free land-appraisal tool for landowners (Attract),
              becoming tech-enabled land promoters ourselves, and finally, an
              AI-powered platform to assist with drafting planning documents
              (Tract Editor).
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite significant technical progress, building tools like Scout
              and the well-received Tract Editor, our journey taught us critical
              lessons from failing to secure a viable, venture-scale business
              model in the British property market. We learned the difficulty of
              selling software into a conservative sector, experienced the
              operational complexities and timelines of land promotion, and
              encountered a low willingness to pay for useful tools.
              Furthermore, we came to understand how the market's conservatism
              and fragmentation limited its potential for venture-backed
              disruption. After nearly two years without revenue or committed
              paying customers, we realised we lacked a clear path to the
              necessary scale and returns. This prompted the decision to cease
              operations and return capital, sharing our experience as a case
              study.
            </p>
            <p>
              In retrospect, it's easy to see ways we could have approached
              things differently. This document is a post mortem, explaining
              what happened and why it went wrong. Our aim in writing this is:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Codify and share what we’ve learned for our benefit and
                hopefully others.
              </li>
              <li>Document the story for posterity.</li>
              <li>
                Produce an artifact to explain, if not justify, the time and
                money spent.
              </li>
              <li>Exorcise our demons.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              We want to stress from the start that the ultimate failure of the
              company lies with us. Some issues were within our control and some
              were beyond it. At times, we’ll describe external factors in ways
              that sound negative. This isn’t an attempt to pass blame. We want
              to tell the story as matter-of-factly as possible. Most
              importantly, we’re extremely grateful to everyone who supported us
              over the last couple of years, in money and in time.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Housing in Britain is expensive because getting planning
                permission is difficult.
              </li>
              <li>
                Granting permission takes the median hectare of land from
                £20,000 to £2.4 million - a 139x uplift.
              </li>
              <li>
                If we can reduce the costs and uncertainty of this process by
                any reasonable amount, we can build a business and help solve
                the housing crisis.

                Many young people have had to delay forming families and often
                take poorly paid, insecure jobs that can barely cover rent and
                living costs as the price for living in culturally attractive
                cities. They see opportunity as limited and growth as barely
                perceptible. Meanwhile, older generations sit on housing
                property worth many times what they paid and, stuck in a
                zero-sum mindset, often prioritise the protection of their own
                neighbourhoods over the need to build more homes. Can you blame
                young people who resent older people, and the West’s economic
                system itself, when this is what it offers them?

            <p>
              Housing in Britain is expensive because of artificial supply
              constraints - specifically, the difficulty of obtaining planning
              permission to build more. Planning permission is Britain’s
              regulatory approval that landowners must secure before developing
              land or changing a building's use. When permission is granted to
              build homes on agricultural land, its value increases dramatically
              (often 140x or more), creating enormous wealth for landowners.
            </p>

            <p>
              This looked like a business opportunity: if we could help more
              sites get planning permission, we could capture some of that
              uplift. The market size looked compelling - billions in Britain
              alone, the political winds seemed favourable, and there seemed to
              be few modern software solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
              We were driven by a mix of moral outrage and technological
              optimism. It seemed absurd that bureaucratic obstacles were
              holding back so much potential value, especially when millions
              were being spent on documentation that could be automated. With
              the rise of LLMs, we believed we could transform this inefficient
              process.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Strategic land teams are groups within property development
              companies responsible for identifying and acquiring land with
              long-term development potential. They focus on finding sites that
              don’t yet have permission for development but possess
              characteristics that suggest it could be obtained in the future.
              The earlier they can identify and secure control of these sites,
              the greater their competitive advantage and profit potential.
            </p>
            <p>
              This felt like a software-shaped problem and could form the basis
              of a larger platform for planning, moving elsewhere along the
              value chain. When Jamie began working on Tract, this site sourcing
              problem was the first thing he looked at.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some sourcing tools existed, but the popular options seemed poorly
              built: badly designed, built atop untrustworthy data sources, and
              not built around the sourcing workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jamie had ideas to improve the product experience and began
              building them out. He started to lean on industry advisors for
              introductions. He read <em>The Mom Test</em> (more on which later)
              and had dozens of calls with whoever would take them.
            </p>
            <p>
              During these calls, he realised his intuitions about the existing
              products’ problems were correct (“I don’t trust it”, “I need to
              check the numbers, it’s annoying”). This was exciting: he thought
              he was onto something.
            </p>
            <p>
              But he didn’t ask why users tolerated it (“It’s fine”, “Does what
              I need”, “We went with [competitor] because, to be honest, they’re
              nice guys”). It was unlikely whatever he built could be 10-100x
              better at solving this problem without radically changing their
              workflow, which was tough for a solo developer working on savings
              – Henry began helping in his free time from late summer but
              wouldn’t come on full time until mid-December.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jamie also began to find <em>more</em> competitors, some
              well-resourced, all of whom appeared to be competing on price.
              These were already cheap contracts: a few hundred pounds per month
              for a small/medium-sized team. And they were getting cheaper.
            </p>
            <p>
              We concluded that this was a difficult market to sell into, with
              race-to-the-bottom pricing dynamics, and no obvious way to make a
              SaaS tool that helped strategic land teams do site selection so
              well that these factors wouldn’t matter. It was time to pivot.

              </li>
              <li>the basis of a network;</li>
              <li>
                and time in which the early data infrastructure which would
                support our subsequent products was built.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              However, it took <strong>too long</strong> to reach the pivot
              point. A more thorough competitor analysis would have revealed the
              market problems earlier, rather than being distracted by writing
              code. None of what we needed to learn required writing code to get
              there.
            </p>
            <p>
              The biggest lesson here:
              <strong>getting time-to-validation as low as possible matters more than
                anything else</strong>. If there are ways faster to get there, you should take them.

              Interlude: Attract (October 2023 - November 2023)
            </h3>
            <p>
              Our site appraisal tool, Attract, emerged from discussions with
              our design partner Paul and from Tract Source's challenges. The
              concept was simple but promising: instead of selling land
              information to developers, we’d provide it to landowners for free.
              The greatest constraint for any promoter or developer is access to
              developable land, so we imagined a tool encouraging landowners to
              reveal their openness to development would be valuable. The
              generated appraisals would allow us to rapidly qualify sites and
              identify potential opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially, we considered selling this tool to developers and land
              promoters seeking strategic land opportunities. However, we
              quickly recognised two fatal flaws in this approach:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The economics didn't work—we couldn't charge more than
                £50/month/customer, and there weren’t many customers.
              </li>
              <li>
                We'd face the same sales challenges as Tract Source, compounded
                by the fact that this was an unconventional solution with no
                market precedents.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Despite this, Jamie completed the conversion work and launched a
              white-labelled version on Paul’s company’s website in early
              November. It delivered impressive results: he received more
              submissions and higher-quality leads. This quick win validated our
              technical approach, but the underlying business model remained
              insufficient to build our company.
            </p>
            <p>
              This experience taught us something valuable: we could create
              genuinely useful tools that solved real problems. However, we
              still hadn't cracked how to transform that utility into a
              venture-scale business model.
            </p>

            </h3>
            <p>
              With the white-labelled version of Attract online, we entered a
              period of exploration and uncertainty. We had a call with a major
              surveyor where we showed them a mocked-up tool for writing a
              planning application using an LLM and the information about a site
              in our database. But after the demo, we were ghosted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Market concerns loomed large. The pricing dynamics made us
              question our ability to raise capital with our current approach.
              In retrospect, we may have been closer to viable products than we
              realised. Multiple British prop-tech companies have been funded,
              including in the US, during the lifetime, suggesting alternative
              paths we could have taken.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite challenges, we continued experimenting. In December, we
              created a ‘Tinder for Buildings’ demo with inpainting models that
              received positive feedback. We continued scoping ways to build a
              business on our planning data work. We were awarded an
              <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/emergent-ventures-winners-32nd-cohort.html" target="_blank">Emergent Ventures grant</a>, validating our mission if not our approach.
            </p>

            

            <h3 id="timeline-jan-2024-may-2024">January 2024 - May 2024</h3>
            <p>
              In January, we began fundraising while working on extracting Local
              Planning Authority validation checklists—technical work to support
              our evolving vision.
            </p>
            <p>
              A February visit to a developer proved illuminating, though not as
              hoped. Their skeptical in-house planner admitted: "To be honest,
              the system being broken helps us." This comment crystallised a
              tension in our market: many established players benefited from the
              inefficiencies we aimed to solve.
            </p>
            <p>
              This realisation prompted us to revisit our fundamental problem
              statement. The facts were compelling: land with planning
              permission becomes dramatically more valuable, and this value
              creation stems from the friction and uncertainty in the planning
              process—friction that good software could reduce.
            </p>
            <p>
              We faced a dilemma. Selling software into this market would be
              tough, and it seemed wasteful to capture only a small slice of the
              value we could create. If we could facilitate 100x value increases
              in land, why sell this capability to others for modest SaaS fees?
              What B2B model could compete with capturing that uplift directly?
            </p>
            <p>
              We considered a radical pivot: becoming land promoters ourselves.
              We’d partner with landowners or acquire land, secure planning
              permission using our technology, and sell with permission
              granted—capturing the value uplift directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              We found another opportunity: promotion costs don't scale linearly
              with site size, making many smaller sites economically unviable
              for traditional promoters. We could counterposition by targeting
              these ignored sites and sell them to SME developers.
            </p>
            <p>This model offered significant advantages:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>We avoided selling software to a resistant market.</li>
              <li>
                The potential revenue and profit margins were substantial,
                especially if we could reduce costs through automation.
              </li>
              <li>
                We had a clear technological roadmap: automate the existing site
                selection and planning application processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                As our own customer, we could optimise an industry that
                underutilised modern technology.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Implementation would be challenging—some aspects like site visits
              couldn't be fully automated—but we believed we could create a
              durable advantage by controlling the critical fulcrum point where
              planning permission is granted.
            </p>
            <p>This became our fundraising narrative:</p>

                </figcaption>
              </a>
            </figure>

            <p>
              During the fundraising process however, we identified a
              bottleneck: access to land. Without reliable land access, our
              growth would be constrained. How would we:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>put ourselves in front of landowners,</li>
              <li>identify the ones open to selling,</li>
              <li>get them over the line?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              One investor – who ultimately passed – described this challenge as
              requiring extensive "hand-cranking"—an apt analogy. But at the
              time, we thought Attract could solve our top of funnel problem.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rather than white-labelling the tool for strategic land teams, we
              could own it, market aggressively to landowners, keep the sites we
              want to develop ourselves and pass the rest to strategic land
              teams for a referral fee. Appraising land and advising on its
              development potential is part of what a land agent does. We would
              be automating that.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why would a landowner use our tool? Partly out of curiosity like
              taking personality quizzes, but also because our information was
              genuinely useful. Land agents bill hundreds of pounds for
              appraisals with the same information we could pull
              programmatically. Henry had recently commissioned two appraisals
              for sites following advice his family had received. They were £600
              each and contained:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                A summary of planning constraints for the site (e.g.
                conservation areas, nearby listed buildings, where the village
                sat in the settlement hierarchy).
              </li>
              <li>
                Relevant local plan policies (e.g. what development to
                encourage/discourage).
              </li>
              <li>Previous planning applications for the site.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              We already had this information or plans to collect it. We could
              generate these appraisals, give them to landowners for free, and
              use this to solve the top-of-the-funnel problem.
            </p>

            <p>
              We made a subtle but critical error here - we assumed the problem
              was limited to the top of our funnel (identifying landowners and
              sites). In reality, as we'd discover, no part of the funnel was
              robust enough to build a venture-scale business in our required
              timeframe.
            </p>

            <p>
              Had we recognised this earlier, we might have concluded this
              business lacked venture-scale potential, or we could have examined
              how to modify our approach.
            </p>

            <p>
              We still agree with the principle behind this pivot; that the next
              generation of billion-dollar companies may
              <a href="https://www.sarahtavel.com/p/ai-startups-sell-work-not-software" target="_blank">sell work</a>, not just software, and that this is especially true in UK
              proptech. We’re happy with the reasoning. But we were entering an
              industry to do something we had no experience in, and without any
              commercial traction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Paul Graham has an essay where he says the most efficient question
              to ask founders is “What have you learnt from users?”. One problem
              this question would have exposed if we’d asked it was that we
              hadn’t spoken to the people using Attract and who would develop
              their land with us. The people we were speaking to and learning
              about planning and development from weren’t our actual users. This
              meant we couldn’t begin testing our product’s commercial traction
              by asking if a user would pay for it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although we erred by not getting relevant user feedback while we
              had months of savings, the focus in the latter part of the raise
              to build a business plan was probably correct. We were working on
              Tract unpaid. As the deadline to raise money approached, our focus
              was (not unreasonably) on getting the funding to survive.
            </p>
            <p>
              These weeks were a success: we raised capital in a tough situation
              when the alternative was to shut down and get jobs. However, we
              had backed ourselves into a corner, not taking advantage of the
              previous time to run a rigorous market and product-discovery
              process.

              The Fundraise (January 2024 - April 2024)
            </h3>

            <p>
              Since raising capital, we've learned our fundraising experience
              was unusual. VCs operate with a fundamental asymmetry: it costs
              them virtually nothing to stay in touch with a company without
              investing, but missing the next unicorn can be catastrophic to
              their portfolio returns. This creates a dynamic where they'll meet
              hundreds of companies annually, rarely delivering outright
              rejections.
            </p>

            <p>
              Contrary to the "VCs never say no" stereotype, most were capable
              of clear passes: "not a market we know enough about" or "we're not
              convinced about this aspect of the pitch." The key insight is
              this: if a VC sees potential, they move quickly. If you're stuck
              in a holding pattern of positive but non-committal feedback, their
              current position is likely "no"—they're leaving the door open in
              case you gain traction or pivot to something more compelling.
            </p>

            <p>
              We found ourselves in this holding pattern. One VC was interested
              but nervous about leading the round, while at another, the lead
              partner wanted to write an angel check but wouldn't commit to
              funding institutionally. This created a frustrating cycle of
              meetings yielding positive feedback followed by requests for "just
              one more" spreadsheet or one-pager to clarify something. During
              this period, we worked to integrate early Attract usage data into
              our narrative about targeting small sites as land promoters.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through delicate back-channeling between the two firms, we got
              them as joint leads, with five angels joining the round. We then
              experienced that classic founder moment where, after securing a
              term sheet, several other firms expressed interest.
            </p>

            <p>
              The process from term sheet to closing took over a month. Despite
              being a straightforward priced round, we had to pay both teams
              lawyers to negotiate minor details. In San Francisco, a deal this
              size would have been done with a quick SAFE note, so it was
              frustrating to spend £25,000 out of the £744,000 we raised on
              legal fees.

              <strong>Warm intros are 100x better than cold outreach</strong> -
              maybe one or two VCs set up calls from a cold email, out of ~50,
              whereas nearly every warm intro was happy to talk to us. These
              came from former colleagues who became investors or had startups
              and introduced us to their VCs. People want to make and receive
              introductions. So, assuming you make a good impression, feel free
              to ask for help. If they don’t feel comfortable (maybe they don’t
              they don’t feel comfortable (maybe they don’t know the person
              well, or they’ve recently taken up a lot of their time, or they’re
              busy) they will politely explain why.

            <p>
              <strong>Running a well-organised raise is better than not, but you
                can’t really plan it.</strong>
              Unless you have hockey-stick growth and a surplus of investor
              interest, you need to work whichever angle you have, even if it
              means abandoning your existing plans.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Try to raise early rounds on a SAFE/ASA</strong> - even in
              tranches, even if it means accepting less cash or a lower
              valuation, even if it complicates your cap table. Despite capping
              legal fees at each stage, we spent £25,000 on lawyers – capital
              that should have gone toward building our business. We waited over
              a month for the money and were distracted figuring out legal
              terms.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Not every business suits VC</strong> - If you’re
              interested in technology or startups, you’ll hear lots from
              venture capitalists. This is partly because they engage in content
              marketing and thought leadership to attract dealflow and partly
              because being a VC requires optimism and interest in the future.
              So their interests will overlap with yours as a startup founder.
              But before you raise money from them, consider if your business
              fits their financing model. Venture investments follow a power law
              model. Venture investments follow a power law where a few pay off
              so well that they cover the others that go to ~zero.
            </p>

            <p>
              A good pitch to a VC should acknowledge the risks of the company
              failing, but not eliminate them. The focus should be on the huge
              opportunity if you overcome them. For decades, software companies
              fit this model. There’s a risky startup stage,but if a company
              survives, they can build moats through network effects (the most
              useful platform is the most popular) and switching costs
              (migrating data and workflows to a new system is hard).
            </p>

            <p>
              Not every business is like this. In real estate, you may have a
              thesis about where demand is going. You may make speculative
              acquisitions or invest in site improvements before selling. It’s
              unlikely these bets will pay off 100 to 1000x like the best
              venture investments. However, a good thesis and execution can
              generate an internal rate of return of 10 to 20% - more than
              keeping pace with a VC fund’s aggregate return. There are
              investors interested in these opportunities but they make less
              noise than VCs. They are often family offices, and may be the LPs
              of venture funds.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some companies try to balance being a high-risk bet with high per
              deal costs by raising money from VCs for an operating company and
              property investors for a property company. The former bet on the
              company growing to process many deals,while the latter bet on the
              success rate of those deals. These complex deals require careful
              alignment of everyone’s incentives.

              April to November 2024
            </h3>

            <p>
              Marketing to landowners proved difficult. An appraisal tool for
              farmers doesn't go viral. We identified things like niche Google
              searches e.g. specific DEFRA forms with low ad competition, but a
              few thousand pounds of ad spend generated minimal activity.
            </p>

            <p>
              The challenge: landowners might pay hundreds for an appraisal, but
              rarely need one. Identifying and reaching them at their moment of
              need was nearly impossible.
            </p>

            <p>We made two critical mistakes:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                We spent three months rebuilding the Appraisal tool before
                contacting landowners who had submitted sites through our MVP.
                These existing submissions represented our only real users, yet
                we failed to nurture these relationships or learn from them
                immediately. We didn't take them seriously enough as potential
                customers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Second, we failed to understand the basic economics of land
                agency—the business we were trying to replace. When we spoke
                with established land agents, we discovered uncomfortable
                truths: they completed very few referrals, and each took 18-24
                months minimum to process.
              </li>
            </ol>

            

            <p>
              Land agents are fragmented: many serve small geographic areas. A
              birds-eye view of this market suggests you can roll it up for
              economies of scale. We liked this logic, so we pursued it.
            </p>

            <p>
              We didn’t consider if the fragmentation was a feature rather than
              a bug. Each agent spends a lot of time building the social
              infrastructure – going to fairs, drinking in pubs, befriending the
              parish council – needed for these deals. Landowners are a small-c
              conservative customer, and they don’t respond well to audacious
              pitches and fast timetables. These deals take 18-24 months because
              these are emotional decisions, not scalable ones.
            </p>

            <p>
              Two or three phone calls could have revealed this reality and
              neutered any delusions about revolutionising this industry.
              Instead, we wasted six months—three building software and three
              wondering why nobody used it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Compounding these errors, we hired extra marketing and operations
              staff based on flawed assumptions:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                We had no evidence that more marketing would help without a
                proven customer acquisition strategy;
              </li>
              <li>
                We weren't constrained enough to justify these hires—we should
                have pushed ourselves harder first.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              We found a few promising sites where the landowner was eager to
              collaborate. However, further investigation revealed unique
              complications that would require bespoke work taking months to
              resolve before we even got onto the steps we aspired to automate.
              This wasn’t a deal breaker, but it would mean using nearly all our
              capital to bet on four sites over the next couple of years. If we
              got them through the system, we could make enough money to repeat
              the process at a greater scale. However, it was also possible that
              we wouldn’t. We would have spent two years working as conventional
              land promoters, which others could do better.
            </p>

            <p>
              As we considered the sites we had and ways to increase
              submissions, we explored higher leverage ways to use our skills.
              What was our comparative advantage? We could build software. So we
              dove back into the murky world of pure proptech.
            </p>

              Interlude: The Grid (December 2024)
            </h3>

            <p>
              The state of our electricity grid is an important story. Whenever
              we met a developer, residential, commercial, or energy, the
              uncertainty about how long they would be stuck in the
              interconnection queue and how much they might pay in first or
              second comer charges would come up. Delays or unexpected charges
              could run into the millions.
            </p>

            <p>
              We lack good tools for modelling the grid. At the time of writing
              the
              <a href="https://www.neso.energy/publications/beyond-2030/web-map" target="_blank">National Energy System Operator’s map</a>
              thinks that Didcot is on the Isle of Wight, and Sizewell B is in
              Scotland. If you want to build something that will draw from or
              inject significant power into the grid, you need to know:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>What is the current capacity around your proposed site?</li>
              <li>What will the capacity be in the next few years?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              We already had a map with layers like power line and substation
              locations, voltages, and official headroom capacity.
            </p>

            <p>
              DNOs publish their actual headroom monthly in tables called the
              embedded capacity register. It wouldn’t be hard to add that.
            </p>

            <p>
              We were scraping planning applications to build a model of future
              generation and demand growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the year’s end, we explored whether this was a worthwhile pivot
              opportunity. We found a couple of developers who hired
              consultancies to build internal tools at great expense. We found a
              couple of start-ups whose demos didn’t justify the huge prices for
              features on our roadmap. We had exciting conversations with one
              energy developer about a design partnership. They wanted a
              platform to find companies in the connection queue open to selling
              their spot.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our idea was speculative, requiring us to negotiate deals in an
              unfamiliar industry. Meanwhile, we were making progress with the
              Editor project. So we shelved this idea.
            </p>

            

            <h3 id="timeline-scout-december-2024">
              Interlude: Scout (December 2024)
            </h3>

            <p>
              While attempting to build a land promoter, we started using
              Landstack, a site sourcing tool, with good quality datasets that
              we hadn’t ingested. We had no desire to compete with them or steal
              their data. We made the mistake of asking for API access. They saw
              this as a red flag, investigated us, realised we were technical,
              and booted us off the platform. So we needed a replacement.
            </p>

            <p>
              We decided to build it ourselves. We had all the needed
              components: data ingestion and map layers. It took about one
              developer-week to create the first version.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why not release it? Allowing people to explore our data might:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>encourage inbound traffic;</li>
              <li>
                crowdsource the debugging and interrogation of our data for
                internal use;
              </li>
              <li>
                and help test the interface for a grid capacity discovery
                product, if we pursued that.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>We launched the tool, called Scout, shortly before Christmas.</p>

            <p>
              Scout did well, with a few hundred visitors, some acclaim on
              Twitter and LinkedIn, and emails and comments thanking us for it;
              it was our most-used product.
            </p>

            <p>
              We’d like to think we caused a stressful Christmas at Landstack,

              Scout was our most-used product. Its users weren’t our target
              market, but some were. We had vague ambitions to use it as an
              inbound marketing tool, but we never capitalised on it. This was a
              missed opportunity.
            </p>

            <p>
              There was some accidental product-market fit. We found an organic
              audience for our side project; making our data free and easy to
              access provided genuine value.
            </p>

              Tract Editor (December 2024 - March 2025)
            </h3>

            <p>
              During the same tech sprint that produced Scout, we started
              considering reviving the planning applications platform.
            </p>

            <p>
              We had all this information in our database – most required for
              the desk reports for planning applications – but were only using
              it for appraisals. To drive down the cost of planning
              applications, we needed to automate as much of the process as
              possible, including writing these reports.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since we abandoned the idea of doing property development
              ourselves, we considered selling the tool directly. Many US
              startups help draft documents in development and construction, so
              there was some precedent.
            </p>

            <p>
              A demo came together quickly. We dumped our appraisal output into
              a JSON blob. We parsed policies from an LPA's local plan. We built
              a document editor using open source components. We chained LLM
              prompts with our planning information – and got good results. A
              vision for this product began to form. We'd sell an LLM wrapper to
              planning consultants and developers to speed up document drafting.
              Then we'd expand to become the platform for managing all their
              projects, each with dozens of documents - hundreds with revisions.
              Hundreds of thousands of planning applications are submitted
              yearly, but no tool captures the institutional knowledge that
              compounds from project to project.
            </p>

            <p>
              This felt promising. It played to our strengths as software
              developers. There was a sales playbook we could follow and our
              investors would understand for the next round. Preliminary
              discussions suggested the market was more open to our product:
              even planners realised they needed an answer to the AI question.
            </p>

            <p>
              There was also a path to apply our technology to the US market,
              particularly California, which has its own housing crisis and
              legal hurdles.
            </p>

            <p>
              We could build tools to help people navigate applications like lot
              subdivisions or rezoning petitions, or a tool for searching trial
              court rulings. Developers sometimes sue the city council, and
              these rulings don’t automatically become planning policy like
              Planning Inspectorate rulings in England, but they’re useful.
              Developers pay land use attorneys a lot of money to research them.
              Or we could help multijurisdictional landlords keep up with
              different regulations.
            </p>

            <p>
              The common thread was our ability to ingest large numbers of
              documents, map their content onto a geospatial layer, and ask
              meaningful questions. Our technical foundation could support
              multiple business models in the UK and US.
            </p>

            <p>
              Expanding internationally would require significant resources and
              market knowledge. We decided to focus on validating our core
              product with UK customers before pursuing US opportunities.
            </p>

            

            <h4>Setting up design partnerships</h4>

            <p>
              Towards the end of 2024, we set up calls with several planning
              consultants. We asked about their workflows and what tools. We
              described our vision and showed them our demo. The responses were
              all positive.
            </p>

            <h4>Narrowing focus to pre-app letters</h4>

            <figure>
              <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KP9sJ8Rk2DLHHQFnz97o45WkbVQEd4pN" target="_blank">

                </figcaption>
              </a>
            </figure>

            <p>
              After a month of calls and building, we realised our product was
              too general-purpose. We needed to focus on a specific problem. We
              had little evidence of selling this software and wanted a clear
              use-case to ground our offering.
            </p>

            <p>
              We focused on pre-app statements. Most local authorities ask major
              developments to get pre-application advice: feedback on an initial
              proposal before submission, to ensure the basics are solid. It was
              the simplest document we saw. Most applications go through pre-app
              first – about 80%, according to one customer – it’s usually step
              one. We knew the costs and timelines, so we could anchor the
              pricing. And we had most of the information to generate them.
            </p>

            <p>
              This led to a product called Tract Editor. Users would draw their
              site boundaries on a map, and we would pull existing site
              information. We could generate and reuse our appraisal output, so
              this was easy. We could pass this information into an LLM to
              produce a first-draft pre-app statement.
            </p>

            <p>
              We’d add normal document editor features – comments, versioning,
              WYSIWYG, etc. – to integrate it into their workflow and avoid
              needing a perfect first draft. It could get you a reasonable
              starting point, like a junior planning consultant, which you could
              refine in a familiar environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              We built a good tool that produced compelling first drafts from
              minimal information. It had a smart Q&amp;A UI allowing the model to
              ask the user questions and regenerate sections based on the
              answers. It treated the planning system as a first-class citizen
              of the document editor, rather than focusing on the AI. It cited
              its sources and provided references for the quoted planning
              policy.

            <p>
              Our design partners seemed happy. We had made a marketing website
              and received good feedback from industry people. We chose a price
              of £99/user/month. We were ready to start selling.

              By this stage, we knew to talk to customers before, during, and
              after building a demo, and we didn’t spend too much time coding
              before getting positive feedback. What we did wrong was assume
              ‘positive feedback’ meant ‘desire to purchase’.

              <strong>Customer switching costs have a psychological as well as
                economic logic.</strong>
              Better alone doesn’t mean people will use it. You’re competing
              with another workflow plus any status quo bias, which can be
              significant.

              The Decision To Stop (March 2025)
            </h3>

            <p>
              When we offered a 50% discount to our design partners and asked
              what would get them to commit, their response was telling. Despite
              positive feedback, they wanted significant additional features
              like full planning statements before signing. This forced us to
              confront several hard truths:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Despite positive feedback, customers weren't ready to commit,
                even with steep discounts.
              </li>
              <li>
                After nearly two years, we had zero revenue to show for our
                efforts. (We clearly weren’t great at this!)
              </li>
              <li>
                Our opportunity cost was rising as the tech landscape evolved
                rapidly.
              </li>
              <li>
                While we might build a business that could support us, we
                couldn't see a path to the venture-scale returns our investors
                deserved.
              </li>
              <li>
                The British market was too small, fragmented, and resistant to
                change for us to progress at the speed and scale our investors
                required.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Any one of these challenges could have been addressed. But
              collectively, they showed we faced months of struggling to secure
              small revenues through manual sales processes in a market with no
              clear path to venture-scale growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              We considered pivoting to the US and drastically reducing our burn
              rate. Ultimately, we chose to return the remaining capital to our
              investors and walk away.

            <p>
              We raised capital for an unconventional business model in a
              challenging sector. In a difficult fundraising environment, we
              secured funding from institutional investors and angels who
              believed in our vision to transform the British housing market.
              This is no small feat for a pre-revenue company in an industry not
              known for technological innovation.

              <li>
                Scout became a useful tool with recurring users and positive

              </li>
              <li>
                Our Appraisals product was fast, well-designed, and provided

            <p>
              When we recognised our land promotion strategy wasn’t working, we
              decided to pivot quickly. We parted ways with the non-technical
              employees not involved in building Tract Editor. We found design
              partners enthusiastic about our product and committed to giving us
              feedback, while keeping our investors informed about our strategic
              shift.

            <p>
              There are many ways in which we wasted time and money. But we are
              proud of the fact that we closed down the company because we
              couldn't see a way to make it work for our investors, and I think
              we can all sleep well knowing that we made the right call.

            <p>
              We developed valuable relationships. From planning consultants to
              developers to land agents, we built a network that provided
              insights, feedback, and opportunities that would have been
              invaluable had the business continued.
            </p>

            <p>
              We knew little about planning before this. But learned enough to
              build something that impressed the industry experts. This isn’t a
              complete win - we didn’t convert them to paying users. But they
              took us seriously. That’s not something we were certain we’d
              manage at the outset and gives us confidence moving forward.
            </p>

            <h3 id="reflections-reasonable-errors">Reasonable Errors</h3>

            <p>
              By 'reasonable', we mean mistakes that were understandable given
              the available information and our natural inclinations as
              founders.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our technical and product execution was strong. Our ultimate
              challenges were market selection, business model fit, and the
              British planning system’s dynamics rather than our ability to
              build useful technology.
            </p>

              Overestimating the British market's size and receptiveness
            </h4>

            <p>
              The British proptech and planning market seemed substantial, given
              the dramatic land value increases from planning permission. There
              seemed to be a venture-scale opportunity, especially as several
              British proptech companies secured funding during our journey.

            <p>
              If our software could help many sites secure planning permission,
              it made sense to capture as much of that value as possible. But we
              underestimated the uniqueness of each site’s challenges and the
              “hand-cranking” needed to get landowners over the line. The way to
              run a business like this is to use off-the-shelf tools and raise
              money from institutions seeking a less risky 10 to 20% IRR.

            </h4>

            <p>
              As technically-oriented founders, we gravitated toward building
              solutions. When faced with challenges, our impulse was to solve
              them with better technology rather than rethink our market
              approach. This technical optimism is common among founders with
              our background and was reinforced by the emergence of powerful new
              AI tools.

            <h4 id="reflections-building-a-team-too-early">
              Building a team too early
            </h4>

            <p>
              Conventional startup wisdom encourages bringing on talent to
              accelerate growth. With funding secured and ambitious goals,
              adding team members seemed logical.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is a classic startup dilemma: you need people to build and
              sell your product, but adding headcount increases burn rate and
              creates complexity before validating your revenue model. The error
              wasn't in hiring - many successful startups scaled their teams
              pre-revenue - but rather that we didn't have a clear hypothesis
              about how these hires would validate our core assumptions.
            </p>

            <p>
              There's no perfect formula here. Too little hiring can mean missed
              opportunities and founder burnout; too much creates financial
              pressure and overhead. Our mistake was not ensuring each hire was
              tightly coupled to the critical path to revenue.
            </p>

            <h4 id="reflections-not-entering-the-us-market">
              Not entering the US market
            </h4>

            <p>
              This might have offered more opportunities. Many VC-backed
              proptech companies founded before and during Tract’s lifetime
              (e.g. LandTech, SchemeFlow, PermitPortal) expanded to the US. Land
              use and zoning varies across US states, but traction in one may
              have been enough to raise the money to fund others.
            </p>

            <p>
              But our challenge was understanding users deeply enough to build
              something they'd pay for. If we struggled in our home market with
              networks and cultural understanding, it's not obvious we'd have
              fared better in the US.

              The US is the largest and most dynamic market. Even niche
              industries are large enough for venture-scale companies to exist.
              This is rarer in Britain.
            </p>

            <p>
              If your value proposition is built around saving labour costs or
              augmenting productivity, Britain’s lower median salaries are a
              ceiling on both the value you can create and the portion you can
              capture as a vendor.

              Prioritise finding users in America if you want to raise money
              from American VCs. They will invest in European companies but

            <p>
              Consider the market size, but also assess how receptive your
              target users are to new products and workflows. Questions to ask:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Does the market have early adopters willing to try new
                solutions, or is it dominated by late majority/laggard customers
                who wait for proven technologies?
              </li>
              <li>
                Can you easily identify and access decision-makers? Markets with
                clear purchasing authority and shorter sales cycles allow faster
                iteration and learning.
              </li>
              <li>
                Do potential customers engage with product demos, respond
                promptly to communication, and provide actionable feedback?
              </li>
              <li>
                Are there self-contained pain points you can start selling a
                solution for, or a long tail of features customers need before
                they’ll pay?
              </li>
              <li>
                Is the customer base concentrated enough to build momentum
                through reference customers, or so diffuse that each sale
                requires starting from scratch?

              We hired too soon, rented an office, and spent money on
              branding/design before having a clear revenue route. Money gives
              you more latitude, which means more opportunities to avoid
              necessary actions.

              We focussed too much on building a theoretically sound business
              model and too little on testing it in the market. If we had asked
              “what have we learnt from users?” throughout 2024, it would have
              exposed that very little informing our product decisions came from
              conversations with our target market. Get traction with your
              target users before raising money.

              We were distracted by Tract’s potential to help solve the housing
              crisis. But since we never made any money, we couldn’t keep going,
              making it irrelevant. It’s great to have a mission beyond making
              money. But if it doesn’t contribute to making your business
              sustainable, it will need to take a back seat for a few years.

              The adage that ‘a rising tide lifts all boats’ is true, but
              incomplete. Success not only lifts you, but it changes you. It
              gives you more confidence, energy, and a faster learning rate.
              Conversely, treading water in a low-tide harms you. It saps your
              energy, forces you into strange epicycles. Beware treading water.

              We often learned something that showed us we had to change, but it
              took months to ask the right questions or perform the test. When
              considering an idea, think of ways to instantly find out if it’s
              flawed. For instance, it took too long to realise referring sites
              to developers through Attract wasn’t an easy way to get short-term
              revenue. We knew people who did referrals on the side and how the
              process worked but never drilled down into how long it took and
              what made the conversations drag on.

              I'm spending the next few weeks writing and attending to life
              admin. I'm tempted by the thought of another startup while the
              lessons from the last one are fresh. I'm giving thought to ways I
              can be useful before committing to the next path. Some things I'm
              interested in:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Buildings and urbanism.</strong> Similar to Tract's
                mission. I'm cautiously optimistic that we are going to increase
                the rate of building in the next few years in the places where
                it is most needed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>I'm increasingly concerned by our shrinking industrial
                  base.&nbsp;</strong>
                In Britain, I think high energy costs are a major factor. And in
                both Europe and America I'm worried about what we can rely on if
                relations with China worsen.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>AI.</strong> Obviously the biggest story this decade the
                area in which I have the most professional experience.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>I'm open to relocating to the US.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Appeals and planning apps search.</strong> The industry

                semantic search (“give me every planning application in this
                borough within the last decade that was rejected because of a
                disagreement about materials”) could be a nice product.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>An accurate grid capacity map and trading platform.</strong>
                See Interlude: The Grid above.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Better industry-specific content.</strong> Most planning
                media is rubbish; an LLM could do just as good a job; thoughtful
                humans could do much better (<a href="https://gwern.net/matt-levine" target="_blank">who’s the Matt Levine of planning?</a>).
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>LLM-powered web scraping.</strong> Frameworks like
                <a href="https://scrapy.org/" target="_blank">scrapy</a> and its

                are valuable, but many use cases need more intelligence, which
                modern LLMs could provide.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>A tech-enabled land promoter.</strong>
                We still think somebody should do this – just not via VC funding
                – but there are ways to reduce planning application costs and
                make this business work.

<p>Through a couple of different avenues I wandered, yet again, down a rabbit hole
leading to the topic of this post.  The first avenue was through my main focus
on a particular machine learning topic that utilized some concepts from
physics, which naturally led me to stochastic calculus.  The second avenue was
through some projects at work in the quantitative finance space, which is one
of the main applications of stochastic calculus.  Naively, I thought I could
write a brief post on it that would satisfy my curiosity -- that didn't work
out at all! The result is this extra long post.</p>
<p>This post is about stochastic calculus, an extension of regular calculus to
stochastic processes.  It's not immediately obvious
but the rigour needed to properly understand some of the key ideas requires
going back to the measure theoretic definition of probability theory, so
that's where I start in the background. From there I quickly move on to
stochastic processes, the Wiener process, a particular flavour of stochastic
calculus called Itô calculus, and finally end with a couple of applications.
As usual, I try to include a mix of intuition, rigour where it helps intuition,
and some simple examples.  It's a deep and wide topic so I hope you enjoy my
digest of it.</p>

<h2><a href="#id6"><span>1</span> Motivation</a></h2>
<p>Many physical phenomena (and financial ones) can be modelled as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process">stochastic process</a>
that is described using a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation">stochastic differential equation</a>.
Both of these things were probably not included in most introductory courses on
either probability or calculus.  Starting with stochastic processes, the
easiest way to think about it is a collection of random variables indexed by
time.  So instead of a single deterministic value at each time <span>\(t\)</span>, we have
a random variable instead (usually with some relationship or common property
with the other ones).
So while on the surface it seems relatively simple, one of the big complexities
we run into is when we let <span>\(t\)</span> be continuous, which we will see in detail
later.</p>
<p>Stochastic differential equations defined on continuous time are a very
natural way to model many different phenomena.  A common stochastic
differential equation called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langevin_equation">Langevin equation</a>
is used to model many types of stochastic phenomena:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dX(t)}{dt} = \alpha(X, t) + \beta(X, t)\eta(t) \tag{1.1}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>where <span>\(X(t)\)</span> is a stochastic process, <span>\(\alpha, \beta\)</span> can be a
function of both <span>\(X\)</span> and time <span>\(t\)</span>, and a noise term
<span>\(\eta(t)\)</span>.  The noise term is what makes this differential equation
special by introducing a special type of randomness.  And while this is just a
single example, it does have many characteristics that show up in other
applications of stochastic calculus.</p>
<p>Intuitively, the noise term <span>\(\eta(t)\)</span> represents "random fluctuations"
such as a particle's random collisions with other molecules in a fluid, or the
random fluctuations of a stock price.  To be precise about these "random
fluctuations", we first must specify some of their characteristics such as
their
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation">time correlation</a> function:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
C(\tau) = E[\eta(0)\eta(\tau)] = \lim_{T\to\infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \eta(t)\eta(t+\tau) dt \tag{1.2}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>which should be a decreasing function of <span>\(\tau\)</span> since they are random
fluctuations and shouldn't have lasting effects.  But this can get messy
relatively quickly so we usually look for more clean abstractions to describe
these systems.</p>
<p>The assumption that is commonly used is that the random fluctuations are not
correlated at all.  This can be justified if the time scale of interest is much
bigger than the random fluctuations.  From this assumption, we have:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
E[\eta(0)\eta(\tau)] = c\delta(\tau) \tag{1.3}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>where <span>\(c\)</span> is a constant and <span>\(\delta(\tau)\)</span> is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function">Dirac delta</a> function.
This implies that the random fluctuations are entirely uncorrelated even for
infinitesimal timescales.  The other corresponding assumption is that at each
timestep <span>\(t\)</span> the random variable <span>\(\eta(t)\)</span> is a zero mean Gaussian.</p>
<p>In some ways, <span>\(\eta(t)\)</span> simplifies things; in others, it makes them much
more complex.  The first thing to note is that <span>\(\eta(t)\)</span> is a theoretical
construct -- there is no random process that can have its properties.
We can see that from Equation 1.3 where we use the theoretical
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function">Dirac delta</a> function.
This also implies that the variance of <span>\(\eta(t)\)</span> is infinite (<span>\(C(\tau=0)\)</span>).
This construction also has a flat power spectral density of all frequencies,
implying an infinite bandwidth signal (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise">Wikipedia</a>),
which again is not physically realizable.</p>
<p>Another consequence of this definition is that <span>\(\eta(t)\)</span> is discontinuous
everywhere.  The value at <span>\(\eta(t)\)</span> can be totally different at a small
time increment later (<span>\(\eta(t + dt)\)</span>).  This makes simple operations like
integration much more difficult.  Going back to our stochastic differential
equation from Equation 1.1, we can multiply through by <span>\(dt\)</span> and integrate
both sides to try to get:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
X(T) = X(0) + \int_0^T \alpha(X, t)dt + \int_0^T \beta(X, t)\eta(t)dt \tag{1.4}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>The first integral on the right hand side is a standard one that generally we
know how to solve using the tools of calculus.  The second integral involving
<span>\(\eta(t)\)</span> is where we run into an issue.  It is precisely this problem
that has spawned a new branch of mathematics called <em>stochastic calculus</em>,
which is the topic of this post.</p>

<h3><a href="#id8"><span>2.1</span> Probability Spaces &amp; Random Variables</a></h3>
<p><em>(Note: Skip this part if you're already familiar with the measure theoretic definition of probability.)</em></p>
<p>We're going to dive into the measure theoretic definition of probability, <em>attempting</em> to
give some intuition while still maintaining some level of rigour.  First, let's
examine the definition of a <strong>probability space</strong> <span>\((\Omega, {\mathcal
{F}}, P)\)</span>.  This is the same basic idea you learn in a first probability
course except with fancier math.</p>
<p><span>\(\Omega\)</span> is the <strong>sample space</strong>, which defines the set of all possible
outcomes of an experiment.  In finite sample spaces, any subset of
the sample space is called an <strong>event</strong>.  Another way to think about events is
any grouping of objects you would want to measure the probability on (e.g.,
individual elements of <span>\(\Omega\)</span>, unions of elements, or even the empty
set).</p>
<p>However, this type of reasoning breaks down when we have certain types of
infinite sample spaces (e.g., real line).  For this, we need to define an event more precisely
with an <strong>event space</strong> <span>\(\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^{\Omega}\)</span> (<span>\(2^{\Omega}\)</span> denotes the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set">power set</a>) using a construction
called a <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra ("sigma algebra"):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span>\(\Omega\)</span> be a non-empty set, and let <span>\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> be a collection
of subsets of <span>\(\Omega\)</span>.  We say that <span>\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> is a <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A3-algebra">algebra</a>:
if:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The empty set belongs to <span>\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever a set <span>\(A\)</span> belongs to <span>\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>, its compliment <span>\(A^c\)</span> also belongs to <span>\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>
(closed under complement).</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever a sequence of sets <span>\(A_1, A_2, \ldots\)</span> belongs to <span>\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>,
their union <span>\(\cup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n\)</span> also belongs to <span>\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>
(closed under countable unions -- implies closed under countable intersection).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The elements of a <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)">measurable sets</a>, and the pair <span>\((\Omega, \mathcal{F})\)</span> define a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_space">measurable space</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, we wish our event space <span>\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> to be a <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra and
when combined with <span>\(\Omega\)</span>, define a measurable space.  This sounds
complicated but it basically guarantees that the subsets of <span>\(\Omega\)</span> that
we use for events have all the nice properties we would expect from
probabilities.</p>
<p>Intuitively, measurable spaces help makes the notion of "size" or "volume"
precise by defining the "chunks" of "volume".  Using a physical analogy,
you want to make sure that no matter how you combine non-overlapping "chunks"
(i.e., unions of disjoint sets), you end up with a consistent measure of
"volume".  Again, this is only really needed with infinite (non-countable)
sets.  For finite event spaces, we can usually just use the power set
<span>\(2^{\Omega}\)</span> as the event space, which has all these properties above.</p>
<p>And this brings us to the last part of probability spaces:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>probability measure</strong> <span>\(P\)</span> on an event space <span>\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> is a function that:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Maps events to the unit interval <span>\([0, 1]\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p>Returns <span>\(0\)</span> for the empty set and <span>\(1\)</span> for the entire space,</p></li>
<li>
<p>Satisfies countable additivity for all countable collections of events
<span>\(\{E_i\}\)</span> of pairwise disjoint sets:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
P(\cup_{i\in I} E_i) = \Sigma_{i\in I} P(E_i) \tag{2.1}
\end{equation*}
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These properties should look familiar as they are the three basic ones
axioms everyone learns when first studying probability.  The only difference is
that we're formalizing them, particularly the last one where we may not have
seen it with respect to infinite collections of events.</p>
<p>Going back to the "volume" analogy above, the probability measure maps the
"chunks" of our "volume" to <span>\([0,1]\)</span> (or non-negative real numbers for
general measures) but in a consistent way.  Due to the way we've defined
event spaces as <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra's along with the third condition from
Equation 2.1, we get a consistent measurement of "volume" regardless of how we
combine the "chunks".  Again, for finite sample spaces, it's not too hard to
imagine this function but for continuous sample spaces, it gets more
complicated.  All this is essentially to define a rigorous construction that
matches our intuition of basic probability with samples spaces, events, and
probabilities.</p>
<p>Finally, for a given probability space <span>\((\Omega, {\mathcal {F}}, P)\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>random variable</strong> <span>\(X\)</span> <a href="#id4" id="id1">1</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_function">measurable function</a>
<span>\(X:\Omega \rightarrow E \subseteq \mathbb{R}\)</span> where:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span>\(X\)</span> must part of a measurable space, <span>\((E, \mathcal{S})\)</span> (recall:
<span>\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> defines a <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra on the set <span>\(E\)</span>).
For finite or countably infinite values of <span>\(X\)</span>, we generally use
the powerset of <span>\(E\)</span>.  Otherwise, we will typically use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_set">Borel set</a> for uncountably infinite
sets (e.g., the real numbers).</p></li>
<li>
<p>For all <span>\(s \in \mathcal{S}\)</span>, the pre-image of <span>\(s\)</span> under <span>\(X\)</span>
is in <span>\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>.  More precisely:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
\{X \in \mathcal{s}\} \in \mathcal{F} := \{\omega \in \Omega | X(\omega) \in s\} \in \mathcal{F} \tag{2.2}
\end{equation*}
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>We use random variables to map outcomes from our event space to the real line
(e.g., a RV for a coin flip where heads maps to 1 and tails maps to 0).
However, the mapping must also have the same consistency as we defined above.
So this definition basically ensures that every value that <span>\(X\)</span> can take on
(which must be measurable) has a mapping to one of the measurable events
in our original event space <span>\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>.  We use the notation
<span>\(\sigma(X)\)</span> to denote the collection of all subsets of Equation 2.2,
which form the <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra implied by the random variable <span>\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we didn't have this condition then either: (a) we couldn't properly measure
<span>\(X\)</span>'s "volume" because our "chunks" would be inconsistent (constraint 1),
or (b) we wouldn't be able to map it back to "chunks" in our original
probability space and apply <span>\(P\)</span> to evaluate the random variable's
probability.  If this all seems a little abstract, it is, but that's what we need
when we're dealing with uncountable infinities.  Again, for the finite cases,
all of these properties are trivially met.</p>
<p>Using the probability measure <span>\(P\)</span>, one can calculate the probability of
<span>\(X \in \mathcal{S}\)</span> using Equation 2.2:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
P(X \in s) &amp;= P(\{\omega \in \Omega | X(\omega) \in s \}) \\
           &amp;= P(f \subseteq \mathcal{F}) \tag{2.3}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>where <span>\(s \subseteq \mathcal{S}\)</span> and <span>\(f\)</span> is the corresponding event
in <span>\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>.  We can take <span>\(s = \{x\}\)</span> to evaluate the random
variable at a particular value.  Equation 2.3 basically says that we map
backwards from a set of real numbers (<span>\(s\)</span>) to a set of values in the
sample space (i.e., an event given by Equation 2.2) using the inverse of
function <span>\(X\)</span>.  From the event in our event space <span>\(f \subseteq
\mathcal{F}\)</span>, which is guaranteed to exist because of property (2), we know how
to compute the probability using <span>\(P\)</span>.</p>
<p>So a random variable then allows us to map to real numbers from our original
sample space (<span>\(\Omega\)</span>).  Often times our sample space has no concept
of numbers (e.g., heads or tails) but random variables allow us to assign real
numbers to those events to calculate things like expected values and variances.</p>
<p>For many applications of probability, understanding the above is overkill.
Most practitioners of probability can get away with the "first stage" (see box
below) of learning probability.  However specifically for stochastic calculus,
the above helps us learn it beyond a superficial level (arguably) because we
quickly get into situations where we need to understand the mathematical
rigour needed for uncountable infinities.</p>
<div>
<p>Example 1: Sample Spaces, Events, Probability Measures, and Random Variables</p>
<p>(From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(probability_theory)#A_simple_example">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
<p>Assume we have a standard 52 card playing deck without any jokers,
and our experiment is that we draw a card randomly from this set.
The sample space <span>\(\Omega\)</span> is a set consisting of the 52 cards.
An event <span>\(A \subseteq \mathcal{F}\)</span> is any subset of <span>\(\Omega\)</span>,
i.e., the powerset <span>\(\mathcal{F} = 2^{\Omega}\)</span>.  So that would include
the empty set, any single element, or even the entire sample space.  Some
examples of events:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"Cards that are red and black at the same time" (0 elements)</p></li>
<li><p>"The 5 of Hearts" (1 element)</p></li>
<li><p>"A King" (4 elements)</p></li>
<li><p>"A Face card" (12 elements)</p></li>
<li><p>"A card" (52 elements)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the case where each card is equally likely to be drawn, we
can define a probability measure for event <span>\(A\)</span> as:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{|A|}{52} \tag{2.4}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>We can additionally define a random variable as:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
X(\omega \in \Omega) =
\begin{cases}
    1 &amp;\text{if } \omega \text{ is red}\\
    0 &amp;\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\tag{2.5}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>Which is a mapping from our sample space <span>\(\Omega\)</span> to a (finite) subset
of the real numbers <span>\(\{0, 1\}\)</span>.  We can calculate probabilities using
Equation 2.3, for example <span>\(X = 1\)</span>:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
P(X \in \{1\}) &amp;= P(\{\omega \in \Omega | X(\omega) \in \{1\} \}) \\

&amp;= \frac{|\{\text{all red cards}\}|}{52} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2}  \\
\tag{2.6}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>The implied <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra of this random variable can be defined as:
<span>\(\sigma(X) = \{ \emptyset, \text{"all red cards"}, \text{"all black cards"}, \Omega \} \subset \mathcal{F}\)</span>.</p>

<p>The Two Stages of Learning Probability Theory</p>
<p><em>(Inspired by the notes from Chapter 1 in [1])</em></p>
<p>Probability theory is generally learned in two stages.  The first stage
describes discrete random variables that have a probability mass function,
and continuous random variables that have a density.  We learn to compute
basic quantities from these variables such as expectations, variances,
and conditionals.  We learn about standard distributions and their properties
and how to manipulate them such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function#Function_of_random_variables_and_change_of_variables_in_the_probability_density_function">transforming continuous random variables</a>.
This gets us through most of the standard applications of probability
from basic statistical tests to likelihood functions.</p>
<p>The second stage of probability theory dives deep into the rigorous
measure theoretic definition.  In this definition, one views a
random variable as a function from a sample space <span>\(\Omega\)</span>
to a subset of the real numbers <span>\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>.  Certain subsets
of <span>\(\Omega\)</span> are called events, and the collection of all possible
events form a <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra <span>\(\mathcal {F}\)</span>.  Each
set <span>\(A\)</span> in <span>\(\mathcal {F}\)</span> has probability <span>\(P(A)\)</span>,
defined by the probability measure <span>\(P\)</span>.
This definition handles both discrete and continuous variables in a elegant
way.  It also (as you would expect) introduces a lot of details underlying
the results that we learn in the first stage.  For example, a random
variable is not the same thing as a distribution (random variables can have
multiple probability distributions depending on the associated probability
measure).  Another quirk that we often don't think about is that not all
distributions have a density function (although most of the distributions
we study will have a density).  Like many things in applied mathematics,
understanding of the rigorous definition is often not needed because
most of the uses do not hit the corner cases where it matters (until it
doesn't).  It's also a whole lot of work to dig into so most folks
like me are happy to understand it only "to a satisfactory degree".</p>

<h3><a href="#id9"><span>2.2</span> Stochastic Processes</a></h3>
<p>Here's the formal definition of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process#Stochastic_process">stochastic process</a> from [2]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose that <span>\((\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)\)</span> is a probability space, and that <span>\(T \subset \mathbb{R}\)</span>
is of infinite cardinality. Suppose further that for each <span>\(t \in T\)</span>,
there is a random variable <span>\(X_t: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span>
defined on <span>\((\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)\)</span>. The function <span>\(X: T \times \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span>
defined by <span>\(X(t, \omega) = X_t(\omega)\)</span> is called a stochastic process with
indexing set <span>\(T\)</span>, and is written <span>\(X = \{X_t, t \in T\}\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a mouthful!  Let's break this down and interpret the definition more intuitively.
We've already seen probability spaces and random variables in the previous
subsection.  The first layer of a stochastic process is that we have a bunch of
random variables that are indexed by some set <span>\(T\)</span>.  Usually <span>\(T\)</span> is
some total ordered sequence such as a subset of the real line (e.g., <span>\((0,
\infty)\)</span>) or natural numbers (e.g., <span>\(0, 1, 2, 3 \ldots\)</span>), which intuitively
correspond to continuous and discrete time.</p>
<p>Next, we turn to the probability space on which each random variable is defined on
<span>\((\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)\)</span>.  The key thing to note is that the elements of
the sample space <span>\(\omega \in \Omega\)</span> are infinite sets that correspond to
experiments performed at each index in <span>\(T\)</span>. (Note: by definition it's infinite
because otherwise it would just be a random vector.)  For example, flipping a
coin at every (discrete) time from <span>\(0\)</span> to <span>\(\infty\)</span>, would define a
specific infinite sequence of heads and tails <span>\(\omega = \{H, T, H, H, H, T, \ldots\}\)</span>.
So each random variable <span>\(X_t\)</span> can depend on the entire sequence of the
outcome of this infinite "experiment".  That is, <span>\(X_t\)</span> is a mapping
from outcomes of our infinite experiment to (a subset of) the real numbers:
<span>\(X_t: \Omega \rightarrow E \subseteq \mathbb{R}\)</span>.
It's important to note that in this general definition we have no explicit
concept of time, so we can depend on the "future".  To include our usual
concept of time, we need an additional concept (see adapted processes below).</p>
<p>Finally, instead of viewing the stochastic process as a collection of random variables
indexed by time, we could look at it as a function of both time and the sample space
i.e., <span>\(X(t, \omega) = X_t(\omega)\)</span>.  For a given outcome of an experiment
<span>\(\omega_0\)</span>, the deterministic function generated as <span>\(X(t, \omega=\omega_0)\)</span> is
called the <strong>sample function</strong>.  However, mostly we like to think of it
as having a random variable at each time step indicated by this notation:
<span>\(X = \{X_t, t \in T\}\)</span>.  We sometimes use the notation <span>\(X(t)\)</span> to refer
to the random variable at time <span>\(t\)</span> or the stochastic process itself.</p>
<p>Stochastic processes can be classified by the nature of the values the random variables
take and/or the nature of the index set:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Discrete and Continuous Value Processes</strong>: <span>\(X(t)\)</span> is discrete if at all "times" <span>\(X(t)\)</span> takes on values in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set">countable set</a> (i.e., can be mapped to a subset of the natural numbers);
otherwise <span>\(X(t)\)</span> is continuous.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discrete and Continuous Time Processes</strong>: <span>\(X(t)\)</span> is discrete time process if the index set is
countable (i.e., can be mapped to a subset of the natural numbers), otherwise it is a continuous time process.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Generally continuous time processes are harder to analyze and will be the focus
of later sections.  The next two discrete time examples give some intuition about
how to match the formal definition to concrete stochastic processes.</p>
<div>
<p>Example 2: Bernoulli Processes</p>
<p>One of the simplest stochastic processes is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_process">Bernoulli Process</a>, which
is a discrete value, discrete time process.  The main idea is that a
Bernoulli process is a sequence of independent and identically distributed
Bernoulli trials (think coin flips) at each time step.</p>
<p>More formally, our sample space <span>\(\Omega = \{ (a_n)_1^{\infty} : a_n
\in \{H, T\} \}\)</span> is the set of all infinite sequences of "heads" and "tails".
It turns out the event space and the probability measure are surprisingly
complex to define so I've put those details in Appendix A.</p>
<p>We can define the random variable given an outcome of infinite tosses
<span>\(\omega\)</span>:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
X_t(\omega) =  \begin{cases}
    1 &amp;\text{if } \omega_t = H\\
    -1 &amp;\text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \tag{2.7}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>for <span>\(\omega = \omega_1 \omega_2 \omega_3 \ldots\)</span>, where each <span>\(\omega_i\)</span>
is the outcome of the <span>\(i^{th}\)</span> toss.
For all values of <span>\(t\)</span>, the probability <span>\(P(X_t = 1) = p\)</span>, for
some constant <span>\(p \in [0, 1]\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Example 3: One Dimensional Symmetric Random Walk</p>
<p>A simple one dimensional symmetric <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk">random walk</a>
is a discrete value, discrete time stochastic process.  An easy way to
think of it is: starting at 0, at each time step, flip a fair coin and move
up (+1) if heads, otherwise move down (-1).</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="Scaled Symmetric Random Walk" src="https://bjlkeng.io/images/stochastic_calculus_random_walk.png"></p><p><strong>Figure 1: 1D Symmetric Random Walk</strong> (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/random-walks-with-python-8420981bc4bc">source</a>)</p>
</div>
<p>This can be defined in terms of the Bernoulli process <span>\(X_t\)</span> from
Example 2 with <span>\(p=0.5\)</span> (with the same probability space):</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
S_t(\omega) =  \sum_{i=1}^t X_t \tag{2.8}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>Notice that the random variable at each time step depends on <em>all</em> the "coin
flips" <span>\(X_t\)</span> that came before it, which is in contrast to just the
current "coin flip" for the Bernoulli process.</p>
<p>Another couple of results that we'll use later.  The first is that the increments
between any two given non-overlapping pairs of integers
<span>\(0 = k_0 &lt; k_1 &lt; k_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; k_m\)</span> are independent.  That is,
<span>\((S_{k_1} - S_{k_0}), (S_{k_2} - S_{k_1}), (S_{k_3} - S_{k_2}), \ldots, (S_{k_m} - S_{k_{m-1}})\)</span>
are independent.  We can see this because for any combination of pairs of
these differences, we see that the independent <span>\(X_t\)</span> variables don't
overlap, so the sum of them must also be independent.</p>
<p>Moreover, the expected value and variance of the differences is given by:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
E[S_{k_{i+1}} - S_{k_i}] &amp;= E[\sum_{j=k_i + 1}^{k_{i+1}} X_j] \\
                         &amp;= \sum_{j=k_i + 1}^{k_{i+1}} E[X_j] \\
                         &amp;= 0 \\
Var[S_{k_{i+1}} - S_{k_i}] &amp;= Var[\sum_{j=k_i + 1}^{k_{i+1}} X_j] \\
                           &amp;= \sum_{j=k_i + 1}^{k_{i+1}} Var[X_j]  &amp;&amp; X_j \text{ independent}\\
                           &amp;= \sum_{j=k_i + 1}^{k_{i+1}} 1 &amp;&amp; Var[X_j] = E[X_j^2] = 1 \\
                           &amp;= k_{i+1} - k_i \\
\tag{2.9}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>Which means that the variance of the symmetric random walk accumulates
at a rate of one per unit time.  So if you take <span>\(l\)</span> steps from the
current position, you can expect a variance of <span>\(l\)</span>.  We'll see this
pattern when we discuss the extension to continuous time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="adapted-processes">
<h3><a href="#id10"><span>2.3</span> Adapted Processes</a></h3>
<p>Notice that in the previous section, our definition of stochastic process
included a random variable <span>\(X_t: \Omega \rightarrow E \subseteq \mathbb{R}\)</span>
where each <span>\(\omega \in \Omega\)</span> is an infinite sequence representing a
given outcome for the infinitely long experiment.  This implicitly means
that at "time" <span>\(t\)</span>, we could depend on the "future" because we are
allowed to depend on any tosses, including those greater than <span>\(t\)</span>.  In
many applications, we do want to interpret <span>\(t\)</span> as time so we wish to
restrict our definition of stochastic processes.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapted_process">adapted stochastic process</a>
is one that cannot "see into the future".  Informally, it means that for
any <span>\(X_t\)</span>, you can determine it's value by <em>only</em> seeing the outcome
of the experiment up to time <span>\(t\)</span> (i.e., <span>\(\omega_1\omega_2\ldots\omega_t\)</span> only).</p>
<p>To define this more formally, we need to introduce a few technical definitions.
We've already seen the definition of the
<span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra <span>\(\sigma(X)\)</span> implied by the random variable
<span>\(X\)</span> in a previous subsections.  Suppose we have a subset of our event
space <span>\(\mathcal{G}\)</span>, we say that <span>\(X\)</span> is
<span>\(\mathcal{G}\)</span>-measurable if every set in <span>\(\sigma(X) \subseteq \mathcal{G}\)</span>.
That is, we can use <span>\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> to "measure" anything we do with <span>\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using this idea, we define the concept of a filtration
on our event space <span>\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> and our index set <span>\(T\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>filtration</strong> <span>\(\mathbb{F}\)</span> is a ordered collection
of subsets <span>\(\mathbb{F} := (\mathcal{F_t})_{t\in T}\)</span> where
<span>\(\mathcal{F_t}\)</span> is a sub-<span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra of <span>\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>
and <span>\(\mathcal{F_{t_1}} \subseteq \mathcal{F_{t_2}}\)</span> for all
<span>\(t_1 \leq t_2\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To break this down, we're basically saying that our event space <span>\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>
can be broken down into logical "sub event spaces" <span>\(\mathcal{F_t}\)</span> such
that each one is a superset of the next one.  This is precisely what we want
where as we progress through time, we gain more "information" but never lose
any.  We can also use this idea of defining a sub-<span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra to
formally define conditional probabilities, although we won't cover that in this
post (see [1] for a more detailed treatment).</p>
<p>Using the construct of a filtration, we can define:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A stochastic process <span>\(X_t : T \times \Omega\)</span> is <strong>adapted to the
filtration</strong> <span>\((\mathcal{F_t})_{t\in T}\)</span> if the random variable
<span>\(X_t\)</span> is <span>\(F_t\)</span>-measurable for all <span>\(t\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This basically says that <span>\(X_t\)</span> can only depend on "information" before or
at time <span>\(t\)</span>.  The "information" available is encapsulated by the
<span>\(\mathcal{F_t}\)</span> subsets of the event space.  These subsets of events are
the only ones we can compute probabilities on for that particular random
variable, thus effectively restricting the "information" we can use.
As with much of this topic, we require a lot of rigour in order to make sure we
don't have weird corner cases.  The next example gives more intuition on
the interplay between filtrations and random variables.</p>
<div>
<p>Example 4: An Adapted Bernoulli Processes</p>
<p>First, we need to define the filtration that we wish to adapt to our
Bernoulli Process.  Borrowing from Appendix A, repeating the two equations:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
A_H &amp;= \text{the set of all sequences beginning with } H = \{\omega: \omega_1 = H\} \\
A_T &amp;= \text{the set of all sequences beginning with } T = \{\omega: \omega_1 = T\} \\
\tag{2.10}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>This basically defines two events (i.e., sets of infinite coin toss
sequences) that we use to define our probability measure.  We define our
first sub-<span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra using these two sets:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{F}_1 = \{\emptyset, \Omega, A_H, A_T\} \tag{2.11}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>Let's notice that <span>\(\mathcal{F}_1 \subset \mathcal{F}\)</span> (by definition
since this is how we defined it). Also let's take a look at the events generated
by the random variable for heads and tails:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
\{X_1 \in \{1\}\} &amp;= \{\omega \in \Omega | X_1(\omega) \in \{1\}\} \\
 &amp;= \{\omega: \omega_1 = H\} \\
 &amp;= A_H \\
\{X_1 \in \{-1\}\} &amp;= \{\omega \in \Omega | X_1(\omega) \in \{-1\}\} \\
 &amp;= \{\omega: \omega_1 = T\} \\
 &amp;= A_T \\
 \tag{2.12}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>Thus, <span>\(\sigma(X_1) = \mathcal{F}_1\)</span> (the <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra implied by
the random variable <span>\(X_1\)</span>), meaning that <span>\(X_1\)</span> is indeed
<span>\(\mathcal{F}_1\)</span>-measurable as required.</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at what this means.  For <span>\(X_1\)</span>, Equation 2.11 defines
the only types of events we can measure probability on, in plain English:
empty set, every possible outcome, outcomes starting with the first coin
flip as heads, and outcomes starting with the first coin flip as tails.
This corresponds to probabilities of <span>\(0, 1, p\)</span> and <span>\(1-p\)</span>
respectively, precisely the outcomes we would expect <span>\(X_1\)</span> to be able
to calculate.</p>
<p>On closer examination though, this is not exactly the same as a naive understanding
of the situation would imply.  <span>\(A_H\)</span> contains <em>every</em> infinitely long
sequence starting with heads -- not just the result of the first flip.
Recall, each "time"-indexed random variable in a stochastic process is a
function of an element of our sample space, which is an infinitely long sequence.
So we cannot naively pull out just the result of the first toss.  Instead, we
group all sequences that match our criteria (heads on the first toss) together
and use that as a grouping to perform our probability "measurement" on.  Again,
it may seem overly complicated but this rigour is needed to ensure we don't
run into weird problems with infinities.</p>
<p>Continuing on for later "times", we can define <span>\(\mathcal{F}_2,
\mathcal{F}_3, \ldots\)</span> and so on in a similar manner. We'll find that each
<span>\(X_t\)</span> is indeed <span>\(\mathcal{F}_t\)</span> measurable (see Appendix A for
more details), and also find that each one is a superset of its
predecessor.  As a result, we can say that the Bernoulli process
<span>\(X(t)\)</span> is adapted to the filtration <span>\((\mathcal{F_t})_{t\in
\mathbb{N}}\)</span> as defined in Appendix A.</p>

<div id="weiner-process">
<h3><a href="#id11"><span>2.4</span> Weiner Process</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process">Weiner process</a> (also known as
Brownian motion) is one of the most widely studied continuous time
stochastic processes.  It occurs frequently in many different domains such as
applied math, quantitative finance, and physics.  As alluded to previously, it
has many "corner case" properties that do not allow simple manipulation, and
it is one of the reasons why stochastic calculus was discovered.
Interestingly, there are several equivalent definitions but we'll start with
the one defined in [1] using scaled symmetric random walks.</p>
<div id="scaled-symmetric-random-walk">
<h4>
<span>2.4.1</span> Scaled Symmetric Random Walk</h4>
<p>A scaled symmetric random walk process is an extension of the simple random
walk we showed in Example 3 except that we "speed up time and scale down the
step size" and extend it to continuous time.  More precisely, for a fixed
positive integer <span>\(n\)</span>, we define the scaled random walk as:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
W^{(n)}(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}S_{nt} \tag{2.13}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>where <span>\(S_{nt}\)</span> is a simple symmetric random walk process, provided that
<span>\(nt\)</span> is an integer.  If <span>\(nt\)</span> is not an integer, we'll simply define
<span>\(W^{(n)}(t)\)</span> as the linear interpolation between it's nearest integer
values.</p>
<p>A simple way to think about Equation 2.13 is that it's just a regular random walk
with a scaling factor.  For example, <span>\(W^{(100)}(t)\)</span> has it's first step
(integer step) at <span>\(t=\frac{1}{100}\)</span> instead of <span>\(t=1\)</span>.  To adjust
for this compression of time we scale the process by <span>\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\)</span>
to make the math work out (more on this later).  The linear interpolation is
not that relevant except that we want to start working in continuous time.
Figure 2 shows a visualization of this compressed random walk.</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="Scaled Symmetric Random Walk" src="https://bjlkeng.io/images/stochastic_calculus_scaled_random_walk.png"></p><p><strong>Figure 2: Scaled Symmetric Random Walk</strong> (<a href="https://slideplayer.com/slide/4387046/">source</a>)</p>
</div>
<p>Since this is just a simple symmetric random walk (assuming we're analyzing
it with its integer steps), the same properties hold as we discussed in Example
3.  Namely, that non-overlapping increments are independent.  Additionally, for
<span>\(0 \leq s \leq t\)</span>, we have:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
E[W^{(n)}(t) - W^{(n)}(s)] &amp;= 0 \\
Var[W^{(n)}(t) - W^{(n)}(s)] &amp;= t - s \\
\tag{2.14}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>where we use the square root scaling to end up with variance accumulating still
at one unit per time.</p>
<p>Another important property is called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_variation">quadratic variation</a>,
which is calculated <em>along a specific path</em> (i.e., there's no randomness
involved).  For a scaled symmetric random walk where we know the exact path it
took up to time <span>\(t\)</span>, we get:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
[W^{(n)}, W^{(n)}]_t &amp;= \sum_{j=1}^{nt} (W^{(n)}(\frac{j}{n}) - W^{(n)}(\frac{j-1}{n}))^2 \\
&amp;= \sum_{j=1}^{nt} [\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} X_j]^2  \\
&amp;= \sum_{j=1}^{nt} \frac{1}{n} = t \\
\tag{2.15}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>This results in the same quantity as the variance computation we have (for
<span>\(s=0\)</span>) in Equation 2.14 but is conceptually different.  The variance
is an average over all paths while the quadratic variation is taking a
realized path, squaring all the values, and then summing them up.
In the specific case of a Wiener process, they result in the same thing (not
always the case for general stochastic processes).</p>
<p>Finally, as you might expect, we wish to understand what happens
to the scaled symmetric random walk when <span>\(n \to \infty\)</span>.
For a given <span>\(t\geq 0\)</span>, let's recall a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span>\(E[W^{(n)}(t)] = 0\)</span> (from Equation 2.14 with <span>\(s = 0\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p><span>\(Var[W^{(n)}(t)] = t\)</span> (from Equation 2.14 with <span>\(s = 0\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p><span>\(W^{(n)}(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i=1}^t X_t\)</span> for Bernoulli process <span>\(X(t)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem#Classical_CLT">central limit theorem</a>
states that <span>\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\)</span> converges
to <span>\(\mathcal{N}(\mu_Y, \sigma_Y^2)\)</span> as <span>\(n \to \infty\)</span> for IID
random variables <span>\(Y_i\)</span> (given some mild conditions).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that our symmetric scaled random walk fits precisely the conditions
as the central limit theorem, which means that as <span>\(n \to \infty\)</span>,
<span>\(W^{(n)}(t)\)</span> converges to a normal distribution with mean <span>\(0\)</span> and
variance <span>\(t\)</span>.  This limit is in fact the method in which we'll define
the Wiener process in the next subsection.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiener-process-definition">
<h4>
<span>2.4.2</span> Wiener Process Definition</h4>
<p>We finally arrive at the definition of the Wiener process, which will be the limit
of the scaled symmetric random walk as <span>\(n \to \infty\)</span>.  We'll define it
in terms of the properties of this limiting distribution, many of which are inherited
from the scaled symmetric random walk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given probability space <span>\((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)\)</span>,
suppose there is a continuous function of <span>\(t \geq 0\)</span> that also
depends on <span>\(\omega \in \Omega\)</span> denoted as <span>\(W(t) := W(t, \omega)\)</span>.
<span>\(W(t)\)</span> is a <strong>Wiener process</strong> if the following are satisfied:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span>\(W(0) = 0\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p>All increments <span>\(W(t_1) - W(t_0), \ldots, W(t_m) - W(t_{m-1})\)</span>
for <span>\(0 = t_0 &lt; t_1 &lt; \ldots &lt; t_{m-1} &lt; t_{m}\)</span> are independent; and</p></li>
<li><p>Each increment is distributed normally with <span>\(E[W(t_{i+1} - t_i)] = 0\)</span> and
<span>\(Var[W(t_{i+1} - t_i)] = t_{i+1} - t_i\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>We can see that the Weiner process inherits many of the same properties as our scaled
symmetric random walk.  Namely, independent increments with each one being
distributed normally.  With the Weiner process the increments are exactly normal
instead of approximately normal (for large <span>\(n\)</span>) with the scaled symmetric
random walk.</p>
<p>One way to think of the Weiner process is that each <span>\(\omega\)</span> is a path generated
by a random experiment, for example, the random motion of a particle suspended
in a fluid.  At each infinitesimal point in time, it is perturbed randomly
(distributed normally) into a different direction.  In fact, this is the origin
of the phenomenon by botanist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Brown_(botanist,_born_1773)">Robert Brown</a>
(although the math describing it came after by several others including Einstein).</p>
<p>Another way to think about the random motion is using our analogy of coin tosses.
<span>\(\omega\)</span> is still the outcome of an infinite sequence of coin tosses but
instead of happening at each integer value of <span>\(t\)</span>, they are happening
"infinitely fast".  This is essentially the result of taking our limit to infinity.</p>
<p>We can ask any question that we would usually ask about random variables to the
Wiener process at a particular <span>\(t\)</span>.  The next example shows a few of
them.</p>
<div>
<p>Example 5: Weiner Process</p>
<p>Suppose we wish to determine the probability that the Weiner process
at <span>\(t=0.25\)</span> is between <span>\(0\)</span> and <span>\(0.25\)</span>.  Using
our rigourous jargon, we would say that we want to determine
the probability of the set <span>\(A \in \mathcal{F}\)</span> containing
<span>\(\omega \in \Omega\)</span> satisfying <span>\(0 \leq W(0.25) \leq 0.2\)</span>.</p>
<p>We know that each increment is normally distributed with expectation of
<span>\(0\)</span> and variance of <span>\(t_{i+1}-t_{i}\)</span>, so for the <span>\([0, 0.25]\)</span>
increment, we have:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
W(0.25) - W(0) = W(0.25) - 0 = W(0.25) \sim N(0, 0.25) \tag{2.16}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>Thus, we are just asking the probability that a normal distribution takes
on these values, which we can easily compute using the normal distribution density:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
P(0 \leq W(0.25) \leq 0.2) &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi(0.25)}} \int_0^{0.2} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x}{\sqrt{0.25}})^2}  \\
                           &amp;= \frac{2}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_0^{0.2} e^{-2x^2}  \\
                           &amp;\approx 0.155 \\
                           \tag{2.17}
\end{align*}
</p>
</div>
<p>We also have the concept of filtrations for the Wiener process.  It uses the same definition
as we discussed previously except it also adds the condition that future increments
are independent of any <span>\(\mathcal{F_t}\)</span>.  As we will see below, we will be
using more complex adapted stochastic processes as integrands against a Wiener
process integrator.  This is why it's important to add this additional
condition of independence for future increments.  It's so the adapted
stochastic process (with respect to the Wiener process filtration) can be
properly integrated and cannot "see into the future".</p>
</div>
<div id="quadratic-variation-of-wiener-process">
<h4>
<span>2.4.3</span> Quadratic Variation of Wiener Process</h4>
<p>We looked at the quadratic variation above for the scaled symmetric random walk
and concluded that it accumulates quadratic variation one unit per time (i.e.,
quadratic variation is <span>\(T\)</span> for <span>\([0, T]\)</span>) regardless of the value of
<span>\(n\)</span>.  We'll see that this is also true for the Wiener process but before we
do, let's first appreciate why this is strange.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span>\(f(t)\)</span> be a function defined on <span>\([0, T]\)</span>.  The
<strong>quadratic variation</strong> of <span>\(f\)</span> up to <span>\(T\)</span> is</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
[f, f](T) = \lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}[f(t_{j+1}) - f(t_j)]^2 \tag{2.18}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>for <span>\(\Pi = \{t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_n\}\)</span>, <span>\(0\leq t_1 \leq t_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; t_n = T\)</span>
and <span>\(||\Pi|| = \max_{j=0,\ldots,n} (t_{j+1}-t_j)\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is basically the same idea that we discussed before: for infinitesimally
small intervals, take the difference of the function for each interval,
square them, and then sum them all up.  Here we can have unevenly spaced
partitions with the only condition being that the largest partition has to go to
zero.  This is called the mesh or norm of the partitions, which is similar to
the formal definition of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral">Riemannian integrals</a>
(even though many of us, like myself, didn't learn it this way).  In any
case, the idea is very similar to just having evenly spaced intervals that go to zero.</p>
<p>Now that we have Equation 2.18, let's see how it behaves on a function
<span>\(f(t)\)</span> that has a continuous derivative:
(recall the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_value_theorem">mean value theorem</a>
states that <span>\(f'(c) = \frac{f(a) - f(b)}{b-a}\)</span> for <span>\(c \in (a,b)\)</span>
if <span>\(f(x)\)</span> is a continuous function with derivatives on the respective interval):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
\begin{align*}
[f, f](T) &amp;= \lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}[f(t_{j+1}) - f(t_j)]^2   &amp;&amp; \text{definition} \\
&amp;= \lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}|f'(t_j^*)|^2 (t_{j+1} - t_j)^2 &amp;&amp; \text{mean value theorem} \\
&amp;\leq \lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} ||\Pi|| \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}|f'(t_j^*)|^2 (t_{j+1} - t_j)  \\
&amp;= \big[\lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} ||\Pi||\big] \big[\lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}|f'(t_j^*)|^2 (t_{j+1} - t_j)\big] &amp;&amp; \text{limit product rule}  \\
&amp;= \big[\lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} ||\Pi||\big] \int_0^T |f'(t)|^2 dt = 0&amp;&amp; f'(t) \text{ is continuous} \\
\tag{2.19}
\end{align*}
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we can see that quadratic variation is not very important for most functions
we are used to seeing i.e., ones with continuous derivatives.  In cases where
this is not true, we cannot use the mean value theorem to simplify quadratic
variation and we potentially will get something that is non-zero.</p>
<p>For the Wiener process in particular, we do not have a continuous derivative
and cannot use the mean value theorem as in Equation 2.19, so we end up with
non-zero quadratic variation.  To see this, let's take a look at the absolute
value function <span>\(f(t) = |t|\)</span> in Figure 3.  On the interval <span>\((-2, 5)\)</span>,
the slope between the two points is <span>\(\frac{3}{7}\)</span>, but nowhere in this
interval is the slope of the absolute value function <span>\(\frac{3}{7}\)</span> (it's
either constant 1 or constant -1 or undefined).</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="Mean value theorem does not apply on functions without derivatives" src="https://bjlkeng.io/images/stochastic_calculus_mvt.png"></p><p><strong>Figure 3: Mean value theorem does not apply on functions without derivatives</strong> (<a href="https://people.math.sc.edu/meade/Bb-CalcI-WMI/Unit3/HTML-GIF/MeanValueTheorem.html">source</a>)</p>

<p>Recall, this is a similar situation to what we had for the scaled symmetric
random walk -- in between each of the discrete points, we used a linear
interpolation.  As we increase <span>\(n\)</span>, this "pointy" behaviour persists and
is inherited by the Wiener process where we no longer have a continuous
derivative.  Thus, we need to deal with this situation where we have a function
that is continuous everywhere, but differentiable nowhere.  This is one of the
key reasons why we need stochastic calculus, otherwise we could just use the
standard rules for calculus that we all know and love.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Theorem 1</strong></p>
<p><em>For the Wiener process</em> <span>\(W\)</span>, <em>the quadratic variation is</em> <span>\([W,W](T) = T\)</span>
<em>for all</em> <span>\(T\geq 0\)</span> <em>almost surely.</em></p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong></p>
<p>Define the sampled quadratic variation for partition as above (Equation 2.18):</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
Q_{\Pi} = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\big( W(t_{j+1}) - W(t_j) \big)^2 \tag{2.20}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>This quantity is a random variable since it depends on the particular
"outcome" path of the Wiener process (recall quadratic variation is with
respect to a particular realized path).</p>
<p>To prove the theorem, we need to show that the sampled quadratic variation
converges to <span>\(T\)</span> as <span>\(||\Pi|| \to 0\)</span>.  This can be accomplished
by showing <span>\(E[Q_{\Pi}] = T\)</span> and <span>\(Var[Q_{\Pi}] = 0\)</span>, which says
that we will converge to <span>\(T\)</span> regardless of the path taken.</p>
<p>We know that each increment in the Wiener process is independent, thus
their sums are the sums of the respective means and variances of each
increment.  So given that we have:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
E[(W(t_{j+1})-W(t_j))^2] &amp;= E[(W(t_{j+1})-W(t_j))^2] - 0 \\
                         &amp;= E[(W(t_{j+1})-W(t_j))^2] - E[W(t_{j+1})-W(t_j)]^2 &amp;&amp; \text{definition of the Wiener process}\\
                         &amp;= Var[W(t_{j+1})-W(t_j)]  \\
                         &amp;= t_{j+1} -  t_j &amp;&amp; \text{definition of the Wiener process}\\
                         \tag{2.21}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>We can easily compute <span>\(E[Q_{\Pi}]\)</span> as desired:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
&amp;E[Q_{\Pi}] \\
&amp;= E[ \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\big( W(t_{j+1}) - W(t_j) \big)^2 ] \\
&amp;= \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} E[W(t_{j+1}) - W(t_j)]^2 \\
&amp;= \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (t_{j+1} - t_j)  &amp;&amp; \text{Equation } 2.21 \\
&amp;= T \\
\tag{2.22}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>From here, we use the <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1917647/proving-ex4-3%CF%834">fact</a>
that the expected value of the fourth moment of a normal random variable
with zero mean is three times its variance.  Anticipating the quantity
we'll need to compute the variance, we have:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
E\big[(W(t_{j+1})-W(t_j))^4 \big] = 3Var[(W(t_{j+1})-W(t_j)] = 3(t_{j+1} - t_j)^2 \tag{2.23}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>Computing the variance of the quadratic variation for each increment:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
&amp;Var\big[(W(t_{j+1})-W(t_j))^2 \big] \\
&amp;= E\big[\big( (W(t_{j+1})-W(t_j))^2 -  E[(W(t_{j+1})-W(t_j))^2] \big)^2\big] &amp;&amp; \text{definition of variance} \\
&amp;= E\big[\big( (W(t_{j+1})-W(t_j))^2 -  (t_{j+1} - t_j) \big)^2\big] &amp;&amp; \text{Equation } 2.21 \\
&amp;= E[(W(t_{j+1})-W(t_j))^4] - 2(t_{j+1}-t_j)E[(W(t_{j+1})-W(t_j))^2] + (t_{j+1} - t_j)^2 \\
&amp;= 3(t_{j+1}-t_j)^2 - 2(t_{j+1}-t_j)^2 + (t_{j+1} - t_j)^2 &amp;&amp; \text{Equation } 2.21/2.23 \\
&amp;= 2(t_{j+1}-t_j)^2 \\
\tag{2.24}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>From here, we can finally compute the variance:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
Var[Q_\Pi] &amp;= \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} Var\big[ (W(t_{j+1} - W(t_j)))^2 \big]  \\
           &amp;= \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} 2(t_{j+1}-t_j)^2  &amp;&amp; \text{Equation } 2.24 \\
           &amp;\leq  \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} 2 ||\Pi|| (t_{j+1}-t_j)  \\
           &amp;= 2 ||\Pi|| T &amp;&amp; \text{Equation } 2.22 \\
           \tag{2.25}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>As <span>\(\lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} Var[Q_\Pi] = 0\)</span>, therefore we have shown that
<span>\(\lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} Q_\Pi = T\)</span> as required.</p>
</div>
<p>The term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely">almost surely</a>  is a
technical term meaning with probability 1.  This is another unintuitive idea
when dealing with infinities.  The theorem doesn't say that there are no paths
with different quadratic variation, it only says those paths are negligible in
size with respect to the infinite number of paths, and thus have probability
zero.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, this is quite a profound result: if you take <em>any</em> realized
path of the Wiener process, sum the infinitesimally small squared increments of
that paths, it equals the length of the interval almost surely. In other words,
<em>the Wiener process accumulates quadratic variation at a rate of one unit per
time</em>.</p>
<p>This is perhaps surprising result because it can be <em>any</em> path.  It doesn't
matter how the "infinitely fast" coin flips land, the sum of the square
increments will always approach the length of the interval.  The fact
that it's also non-zero is surprising too despite the path being continuous (but
without a continuous derivative) as we discussed above.</p>
<p>We often will informally write:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
dW(t)dW(t) = dt \tag{2.26}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>To describe the accumulation of quadratic variation at one unit per time.
However, this should not be interpreted to be true for each infinitesimally
small increment.  Recall each increment of <span>\(W(t)\)</span> is normally distributed, so the
LHS of Equation 2.26 is actually distributed as the square of a normal
distribution.  We only get the result of Theorem 1 when we sum a large number
of them (see [1] for more details).</p>
<p>We can also use this informal notation to describe a few other related concepts.
The cross variation (Equation 2.27) and quadratic of variation for the time
variable (Equation 2.28) respectively:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
dW(t)dt &amp;= 0 \tag{2.27} \\
dtdt &amp;= 0 \tag{2.28}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>The quadratic variation for time can use the same definition from Equation 2.18
above, and the cross variation just uses two different function (<span>\(W(t)\)</span>
and <span>\(t\)</span>) instead of the same function.  Intuitively, both of these are
zero because the time increment (<span>\(\Pi\)</span>) goes to zero in the limit by
definition, thus so do these two variations.  This can be shown more formally
using similar arguments as the quadratic variation above (see [1] for more details).</p>

<div id="first-passage-time-for-wiener-process">
<h4>
<span>2.4.4</span> First Passage Time for Wiener Process</h4>
<p>We digress here to show a non-intuitive property of the Wiener process: it will
<em>eventually</em> be equal to a given level <span>\(m\)</span>.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Theorem 2</strong></p>
<p><em>For</em> <span>\(m \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, <em>the first passage time</em> <span>\(\tau_m\)</span> <em>of

<p>This basically says that the Wiener process is almost certain to reach whatever
finite level within some finite time <span>\(\tau_m\)</span>.  Again, there is a
possible realized path of the Wiener process that does not exceed a given level
<span>\(m\)</span> but they collectively are so infinitesimally small that they are

<div id="the-relationship-between-the-wiener-process-and-white-noise">
<h3><a href="#id12"><span>2.5</span> The Relationship Between the Wiener Process and White Noise</a></h3>
<p>The Wiener process can be characterized in several equivalent ways with the
definition above being one of the most common.  Another common way to define
it is from the white noise we discussed in the motivation section.  In this
definition, the Wiener process is the definite integral of Gaussian white
noise, or equivalently, Gaussian white noise is the derivative of the Wiener
process:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
W(t) &amp;= \int_0^t \eta(s)ds \tag{2.29} \\
\frac{dW(t)}{dt} &amp;= \eta(s) \tag{2.30}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>To understand why this relationship is true, let's first define the derivative
of a stochastic process from [4]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A stochastic process <span>\(X(t)\)</span>, <span>\(t \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, is said to be
differentiable in quadratic mean with derivative <span>\(X'(t)\)</span> if</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
\frac{X(t+h) - X(t)}{h} &amp;\to X'(t) \\
E\big[(\frac{X(t+h) - X(t)}{h} - X'(t))^2 \big] &amp;\to 0 \\
\tag{2.31}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>when <span>\(h \to 0\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can see that the definition is basically the same as regular calculus
except that we require the expectation to go to zero with a weaker squared
convergence, which we'll see appear again in the next section.</p>
<p>From this definition, we can calculate the mean of the derivative of <span>\(W(t)\)</span> as:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
E[\frac{dW(t)}{dt}] &amp;= E[\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{W(t+h) - W(t)}{h}] \\
&amp;= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{E[W(t+h)] - E[W(t)]}{h} \\
&amp;= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{0 - 0}{h} \\
&amp;= 0\\
\tag{2.32}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>Similarly, we can show a general property about the time correlation of a
derivative of a stochastic process:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
C_{X'}(t_1, t_2) &amp;= E\big[
    \lim_{k\to 0} \frac{X(t_1 + k) - X(t_1)}{k}
    \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{X(t_2 + h) - X(t_2)}{h}
\big]\\
&amp;= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{1}{h}
   \lim_{k\to 0} E\big[\frac{(X(t_1 + k) - X(t_1))(X(t_2 + h) - X(t_2))}{k}\big] \\
&amp;= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{1}{h}
   \lim_{k\to 0}\big( \frac{E[X(t_1 + k)X(t_2+h)] - E[X(t_1+k)X(t_2)]
                            -E[X(t_1)X(t_2+h)] + E[X(t_1)X(t_2)]}{k}\big) \\
&amp;= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{1}{h}
   \lim_{k\to 0}\big( \frac{C_X(t_1 + k, t_2+h) -C_X(t_1, t_2+h)}{k}
                      - \frac{C_X(t_1+k, t_2) - C_X(t_1, t_2)}{k}\big) \\
&amp;= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{1}{h}
   \big( \frac{\partial C_X(t_1, t_2+h)}{\partial t_1} -
         \frac{\partial C_X(t_1, t_2)}{\partial t_1} \big) \\
&amp;= \frac{\partial C_X(t_1, t_2)}{\partial t_1 \partial t_2} \tag{2.33}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>Thus we have shown that the time correlation of the derivative of a stochastic
process is the mixed second-order partial derivative.  Now all we have to do
is evaluate it for the Wiener process.</p>
<p>First, assuming <span>\(t_1 &lt; t_2\)</span> the Wiener process time correlation is given by
(see this <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/884299/autocorrelation-of-a-wiener-process-proof">StackExchange answer</a>
for more details):</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
0 &amp;= E[W(t_1)(W(t_2) - W(t_1))] &amp;&amp; \text{independent increments} \\
&amp;= E[W(t_1)W(t_2)] - E[(W(t_1))^2] \\
&amp;= E[W(t_1)W(t_2)] - t_1 &amp;&amp; Var(W(t_1)) = t_1 \\
C_W(t_1, t_2) &amp;= E[W(t_1)W(t_2)] = t_1 = \min(t_1, t_2) \\
\tag{2.34}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>We get the same result if <span>\(t_2 &lt; t_1\)</span>, thus <span>\(C_W(t_1, t_2) = \min(t_1, t_2)\)</span>.
Now we have to figure out how to take the second order partial derivatives.
The first partial derivative is easy as long as <span>\(t_1 \neq t_2\)</span>
(see this <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/150960/derivative-of-the-fx-y-minx-y">answer</a> on StackExchange):</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \min(t_1, t_2)}{\partial t_1} &amp;= \begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if } t_1 \lt t_2 \\
0 &amp; \text{if } t_2 \gt t_1
\end{cases} \\
&amp;= H(t_2 - t_1) &amp;&amp; \text{everywhere except } t_1=t_2 \\
\tag{2.35}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>where <span>\(H(x)\)</span> is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function">Heaviside step function</a>.
But we know the derivative of this step function is just the Dirac delta
function (even with the missing point), so:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
C_{W'}(t_1, t_2) = \frac{\partial \min(t_1, t_2)}{\partial t_1\partial t_2}
= \frac{\partial H(t_2-t_1)}{\partial{t_2}} = \delta(t_2-t_1) \tag{2.36}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>From Equation 2.32 and 2.36, we see we have the same statistics as the white noise
we defined in the motivation section above in Equation 1.4.  Since the mean
is also zero, the covariance is equal to the time correlation too:
<span>\(Cov_{W'}(t_1, t_2) = C_{W'}(t_1, t_2)\)</span></p>
<p>Now all we have to show is that it is also normally distributed.  By definition
(given above) the Wiener stochastic process has derivative:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dW(t)}{dt} = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{W(t + h) - W(t)}{h} \tag{2.37}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>But since each increment of the Wiener process is normally distributed (and independent),
the derivative from Equation 2.37 is also normally distributed since the difference of two
independent normals is normally distributed.
This implies the derivative of the Wiener process is a Gaussian process with
zero mean and delta time correlation, which is the standard definition of
Gaussian white noise.  Thus, we have shown the relationship in Equation 2.29 /
2.30.</p>

<h3><a href="#id13"><span>2.6</span> The Importance of the Wiener Process</a></h3>
<p>One question that you might ask (especially after reading the next section) is
why is there so much focus on the Wiener process?  It turns out that the Wiener
process is the <em>only</em> (up to a scaling factor and drift term) continuous
process with stationary independent increments [5].  Let's be more precise.</p>
<p>A stochastic process is said to have independent increments if <span>\(X(t) - X(s)\)</span>
is independent of <span>\(\{X(u)\}_{u\leq s}\)</span> for all <span>\(s\leq t\)</span>.  If
the distribution of the increments don't depend on <span>\(s\)</span> or <span>\(t\)</span>
directly (but can depend on <span>\(t-s\)</span>), then the increments are called
stationary.  This leads us to this important result:</p>

X(t) = X(0) + bt + \sigma W(t) \tag{2.38}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>where <span>\(b, \sigma\)</span> are constants.</p>
</div>
<p>Equation 2.38 is the generalized Wiener process that includes a potentially
non-zero initial value <span>\(X(0)\)</span>, deterministic drift term <span>\(bt\)</span>, and
scaling factor <span>\(\sigma\)</span>.</p>
<p>The intuition behind Theorem 3 follows directly from the central limit theorem.
For a given interval <span>\([s, t]\)</span>, the value of <span>\(X(t) - X(s)\)</span> is the sum
of infinitesimally small independent, identically distributed partitions,
or in other words IID random variables (doesn't have to be normally
distributed).  Thus, we can apply the central limit theorem and get a normal
distribution (under some mild conditions).</p>
<p>Processes with independent increments appear in many contexts.  For example,
the random displacement of a macro particle moving through a fluid caused by the
random interactions with the fluid molecules is naturally modelled using the
Wiener process.  Similarly, the variability of the return of a stock price in a
very short period of time is approximately the same regardless of the price,
thus can also be modelled using a Wiener process.  We'll look at both of these
examples more closely later on in the post.</p>

<h2><a href="#id14"><span>3</span> Stochastic Calculus</a></h2>
<p>One of the main goals of stochastic calculus is to make sense of the following integral:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^t H(s) dX(s) \tag{3.1}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>where <span>\(X(t)\)</span> and <span>\(H(t)\)</span> are two special types of stochastic
processes.  A few questions immediately come to mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>What "thing" do we get out of the stochastic integral?</em>  This is pretty
simple, it's another stochastic process, although it's not immediately clear
that should be case, but rather something that becomes more obvious once we
see the definition.</p></li>
<li><p><em>How do we deal with the limits of integration being in terms of
time</em> <span>\(t\)</span> <em>but the integrand and integrator being stochastic processes
with time index set</em> <span>\(t\)</span>?  We'll see below that the definition of the
integral is conceptually not too different from a plain old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral">Riemannian integral</a> that we learn in
regular calculus, but with some key differences due to the nature of
the stochastic processes we use (e.g., Wiener process).</p></li>
<li><p><em>How do we deal with the case of a non-continuous derivative of the
integrator (e.g., Wiener process), which manifests itself with non-zero
quadratic variation?</em> We'll see that this results in one of the big
differences with regular calculus.  Choices that didn't matter, suddenly
matter, and the result produces different outputs from the usual integration
operation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All the depth we went into previously is about to pay off!  We'll have to use
all of those ideas in order to properly define Equation 3.1.  We'll start with
defining the simpler cases where <span>\(X(t)\)</span> is a Wiener process, and
generalize it to be any Itô process, and then introduce the key result called
Itô's lemma, a conceptual form of the chain rule, which will allow us to solve
many more interesting problems.</p>
<div id="stochastic-integrals-with-brownian-motion">
<h3><a href="#id15"><span>3.1</span> Stochastic Integrals with Brownian Motion</a></h3>
<p>To begin, we'll start with the simplest case when the integrator (<span>\(dX(t)\)</span>
in Equation 3.1) is the Wiener process.  For this simple case, we can define
the integral as:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^t H(s) dW(s) := \lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} H(s_j)[W(t_{j+1}) - W(t_j)] \tag{3.2}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>where <span>\(t_j \leq s_j \leq t_{j+1}\)</span>, and <span>\(||\Pi||\)</span> is the mesh (or
maximum partition) that goes to zero while the number of partitions goes to infinity
like in Equation 2.18 (and standard Riemannian integrals).</p>
<p>From a high level, Equation 3.2 is not too different from our usual Riemannian
integrals.  However, we have to note that instead of having a <span>\(dt\)</span>, we
have a <span>\(dW(s)\)</span>.  This makes the results more volatile than a regular
integral.  Let's contrast the difference between approximating a regular
and stochastic integral for a small step size <span>\(\Delta t\)</span> starting
from <span>\(t\)</span>:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
R(t + \Delta t) &amp;:= \int_0^{t+\Delta t} H(s) ds \approx R(t) + H(t)\Delta t \tag{3.3} \\
I(t + \Delta t) &amp;:= \int_0^{t+\Delta t} H(s) dW(s) \approx I(t) + H(t)(W(t + \Delta t) - W(t)) \tag{3.4}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p><span>\(R(t)\)</span> changes more predictably than <span>\(I(t)\)</span> since we know that each
increment changes by <span>\(H(s)\Delta t\)</span>.  Note that <span>\(H(s)\)</span> can still be
a random (and <span>\(R(t)\)</span> can be random as well) but its change is multiplied by a
deterministic <span>\(\Delta t\)</span>.  This is in contrast to <span>\(I(t)\)</span> which changes
by <span>\(W(t + \Delta t) - W(t)\)</span>.  Recall that each increment of the Wiener process
is independent and distributed normally with <span>\(\mathcal{N}(0, \Delta t)\)</span>.
Thus <span>\(H(t)(W(t + \Delta t) - W(t))\)</span> changes much more randomly and erratically because
our increments follow an <em>independent</em> normal distribution versus just a
<span>\(\Delta t\)</span>.  This is one of the key intuitions why we need to define a
new type of calculus.</p>
<p>To ensure that the stochastic integral in Equation 3.2 is well defined, we need
a few conditions, which I will just quickly summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The choice of <span>\(s_j\)</span> is quite important (unlike regular integrals).
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_calculus#It%C3%B4_integral">Itô integral</a>
uses <span>\(s_j = t_j\)</span>, which is more common in finance; the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_calculus#Stratonovich_integral">Stratonovich integral</a>
uses <span>\(s_j = \frac{(t_j + t_{j+1})}{2}\)</span>, which is more common in physics.
We'll be using the Itô integral for most of this post, but will show the difference
in the example below.</p></li>
<li><p><span>\(H(t)\)</span> must be adapted to the same process as our integrator
<span>\(X(t)\)</span>, otherwise we would be allowing it to "see into the
future".  For most of our applications, this is a very reasonable assumption.</p></li>
<li><p>The integrand needs to have square-integrability: <span>\(E[\int_0^T H^2(t)dt] &lt; \infty\)</span>.</p></li>
<li>
<p>We ideally want to ensure that each sample point of the integrand
<span>\(H(s_j)\)</span> from Equation 3.2 converges in the limit to <span>\(H(s)\)</span> with
probability one (remember we're still working with stochastic processes here).
That's a pretty strong condition, so we'll actually use a weaker
squared convergence as:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n \to \infty} E\big[\int_0^T |H_n(t) - H(t)|^2 dt\big] = 0 \tag{3.5}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>where we define  <span>\(H_n(s) := H(t_j)\)</span> for <span>\(t_j \leq s &lt; t_{j+1}\)</span>
i.e., it's the constant piece-wise approximation for <span>\(H(t)\)</span> using the
left most point for the interval.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>Example 6: A Simple Stochastic Integral in Two Ways</p>
<p>Let's work through the simple integral where the integrand and integrator are
both the Wiener process:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^t W(s) dW(s) = \lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} W(s_j)[W(t_{j+1}) - W(t_j)] \tag{3.6}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>First, we'll work through it using the Itô convention where <span>\(s_j=t_j\)</span>:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
\int_0^t W(s) dW(s) &amp;= \lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} W(t_j)[W(t_{j+1}) - W(t_j)] \\
&amp;= \lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \big[W(t_j)W(t_{j+1}) - W(t_j)^2 + \frac{1}{2}W(t_{j+1})^2 - \frac{1}{2}W(t_{j+1})^2 \big]\\
&amp;= \lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}
\big[\frac{1}{2}W(t_{j+1})^2 - \frac{1}{2}W(t_j)^2
- \frac{1}{2}W(t_{j+1})^2 + W(t_j)W(t_{j+1}) - \frac{1}{2}W(t_j)^2 \big]\\
&amp;= \lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}
\frac{1}{2}[W(t_{j+1})^2 - W(t_j)^2] - \frac{1}{2}[W(t_{j+1}) - W(t_{j})]^2 \\
\tag{3.7}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>The first term is just a telescoping sum, which has massive cancellation:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{2}[W(t_{j+1})^2 - W(t_j)^2] = \frac{1}{2}(W(t)^2 - W(0)^2)
= \frac{1}{2} W(t)^2 - 0 = \frac{W(t)^2}{2}  \tag{3.8}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>The second term you'll notice is precisely the quadratic variance from Theorem 1,
which we knows equals the interval <span>\(t\)</span>.  Putting it together, we have:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^t W(s) dW(s) =  \frac{W(t)^2}{2} - \frac{t}{2} \tag{3.9}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>We'll notice that this <em>almost</em> looks like the result from calculus i.e.,
<span>\(\int x dx = \frac{x^2}{2}\)</span>, except with an extra term.  As we saw
above the extra term comes in precisely because we have non-zero quadratic
variation.  If the Wiener process had continuous differentiable paths, then
we wouldn't need all this extra work with stochastic integrals.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now let's look at what happens when we use the Stratonovich convention
(using the <span>\(\circ\)</span> operator to denote it) with <span>\(s_j = \frac{t_j + t_{j+1}}{2}\)</span>:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
&amp;\int_0^t W(s) \circ dW(s) \\
&amp;= \lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} W(s_j)[W(t_{j+1}) - W(t_j)] \\
&amp;= \lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \big[W(s_j)W(t_{j+1}) - W(s_j)W(t_j) +  W(t_j)W(s_j) - W(t_j)W(s_j) \\
&amp;+ W(t_j)^2 - W(t_j)^2 + W(s_j)^2 - W(s_j)^2 \big] \\
&amp;= \lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \big[W(t_j)(W(s_j) - W(t_j)) + W(s_j)(W(t_{j+1}) - W(s_j)) \big]  \\
&amp;+ \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\big[ W(s_j) - W(t_j) \big]^2 \\
&amp;= \int_0^t W(s) dW(s) + \lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\big[ W(s_j) - W(t_j) \big]^2
&amp;&amp; \text{Itô integral with partitions } t_0, s_0, t_1, s_1, \ldots \\
&amp;= \frac{W(t)^2}{2} - \frac{t}{2} + \lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\big[ W(s_j) - W(t_j) \big]^2
&amp;&amp; \text{Equation 3.9} \\
&amp;= \frac{W(t)^2}{2} - \frac{t}{2} + \frac{t}{2} &amp;&amp; \text{Half-sample quadratic variation} \\
&amp;= \frac{W(t)^2}{2} \\
\tag{3.10}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>We use the fact that the half-sample quadratic variation is equal to
<span>\(\frac{t}{2}\)</span> using a similar proof to Theorem 1.</p>
<p>What we see here is that the Stratonovich integral actually follows our
regular rules of calculus more closely, which is the reason it's used
in certain domains.  However in many domains such as finance, it is not
appropriate.  This is because the integrand represents a decision
we are making for a time interval <span>\([t_j, t_{j+1}]\)</span>, such as a
position in an asset, and we have to decide that <em>before</em> that interval starts,
not mid-way through.  That's analogous to deciding in the middle of the day
that I should have actually bought more of a stock at the start of the day
for a stock that went up in price.</p>

<div id="quadratic-variation-of-stochastic-integrals-with-brownian-motion">
<h4>
<span>3.1.1</span> Quadratic Variation of Stochastic Integrals with Brownian Motion</h4>
<p>Let's look at the quadratic variation (or sum of squared incremental
differences) along a particular path for the stochastic integral we
just defined above, and a related property.  Note: the "output" of the
stochastic integral is a stochastic process.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Theorem 3</strong></p>
<p><em>The quadratic variation accumulated up to time</em> <span>\(t\)</span> <em>by the Itô integral
with the Wiener process</em> (<em>denoted by</em> <span>\(I\)</span>) <em>from Equation 3.2 is</em>:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
[I, I] = \int_0^t H^2(s) ds \tag{3.11}
\end{equation*}
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Theorem 4 (Itô isometry)</strong></p>
<p><em>The Itô integral with the Wiener process from Equation 3.2 satisfies</em>:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
Var(I(t)) = E[I^2(t)] = E\big[\int_0^t H^2(s) ds\big] \tag{3.12}
\end{equation*}
</p>
</div>
<p>A couple things to notice.  First, the quadratic variation is "scaled" by the
underlying integrand <span>\(H(t)\)</span> as opposed to accumulating quadratic
variation at one unit per time from the Wiener process.</p>
<p>Second, we start to see the difference between the path-dependent quantity
of quadratic variation and variance.  The former depends on the path taken
by <span>\(H(t)\)</span> up to time <span>\(t\)</span>.  If it's large, then the quadratic
variation will be large, and similarly small with small values.  Variance
on the other hand is a fixed quantity up to time <span>\(t\)</span> that is averaged
over all paths and does not change (given the underlying distribution).</p>
<p>Finally, let's gain some intuition on the quadratic variation by utilizing
the informal differential notation from Equation 2.26-2.28.  We can re-write
our stochastic integral from Equation 3.2:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
I(t) = \int_0^t H(s) dW(s) \tag{3.13}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>as:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
dI(t) = H(t)dW(t) \tag{3.14}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>Equation 3.13 is the <em>integral form</em> while Equation 3.14 is the <em>differential form</em>,
and they have identical meaning.</p>
<p>The differential form is a bit easier to understand intuitively.  We can see
that it matches the approximation (Equation 3.4) that we discussed in the previous
subsection.  Using this differential notation and the informal notation we defined
above in Equation 2.26-2.28, we can "calculate" the quadratic variation as:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
dI(t)dI(t) = H^2(t)dW(t)dW(t) = H^2(t)dt \tag{3.15}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>using the fact that the quadratic variation for the Wiener process accumulates at
one unit per time (<span>\(dW(t)dW(t) = dt\)</span>) from Theorem 1.  We'll utilize
this differential notation more in the following subsections as we move
into stochastic differential equations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ito-processes-and-integrals">
<h3><a href="#id16"><span>3.2</span> Itô Processes and Integrals</a></h3>
<p>In the previous subsections, we only allowed integrators that were Wiener processes
but we'd like to extend that to a more general class of stochastic processes
called Itô processes <a href="#id5" id="id3">2</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span>\(W(t)\)</span>, <span>\(t\geq 0\)</span>, be a Wiener process with an associated
filtration <span>\(\mathcal{F}(t)\)</span>.  An <strong>Itô process</strong> is a stochastic
process of the form:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
X(t) = X(0) + \int_0^t \mu(s) ds + \int_0^t \sigma(s) dW(s) \tag{3.16}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>where <span>\(X(0)\)</span> is nonrandom and <span>\(\sigma(s)\)</span> and <span>\(\mu(s)\)</span>
are adapted stochastic processes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Equation 3.16 can also be written in its more natural (informal) differential form:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
dX(t) = \mu(t)dt + \sigma(t)dW(t) \tag{3.17}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>A large class of stochastic processes are Itô processes.  In fact, any
stochastic process that is square integrable measurable with respect to a
filtration generated by a Wiener process can be represented by
Equation 3.16
(see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_representation_theorem">martingale representation theorem</a>).
Thus, many different types of stochastic processes that we practically care
about are Itô processes.</p>
<p>Using our differential notation, we can take Equation 3.17
and take the expectation and variance to get more insight:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
E[dX(t)] &amp;= E[\mu(t)dt + \sigma(t)dW(t)] \\
&amp;= E[\mu(t)dt] + E[\sigma(t)dW(t)] \\
&amp;= E[\mu(t)dt] + E[\sigma(t)]E[dW(t)] &amp;&amp; \sigma(t) \text{ and } dW(t) \text{ independent } \\
&amp;\approx \mu(t)dt &amp;&amp; \mu(t) \text{ approx. const for small } dt \tag{3.18} \\
\\
Var[dX(t)] &amp;= Var[\mu(t)dt + \sigma(t)dW(t)] \\
&amp;= E[(\mu(t)dt + \sigma(t)dW(t))^2] - (E[dX(t)])^2 \\
&amp;\approx E[\sigma^2(t)(dW(t))^2] - (\mu(t)dt)^2 &amp;&amp; \text{Equation 2.27/2.28} \\
&amp;= E[\sigma^2(t)dt] &amp;&amp; \text{Equation 2.26} \\
&amp;\approx \sigma^2(t)dt &amp;&amp; \text{ approx. const for small } dt \\
\tag{3.19}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>In Equation 3.18, <span>\(\sigma(t)\)</span> and <span>\(dW(t)\)</span> are independent because <span>\(\sigma(t)\)</span>
is adapted to <span>\(W(t)\)</span>, thus the <span>\(dW(t)\)</span> increment is in the "future" of the
current value of <span>\(\sigma(t)\)</span>.  This reasoning only works because of the choice
of the <span>\(s_j=t_j\)</span> in Equation 3.2 for the Itô integral.</p>
<p>In fact, this result actually holds if we convert to our integral notation:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
E[X(t)] = \int_0^t \mu(s)ds \tag{3.20} \\
Var[X(t)] = \int_0^t \sigma^2(s)ds \tag{3.21} \\
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>So the notation of using <span>\(\mu\)</span> and <span>\(\sigma\)</span> makes more sense.
The regular time integral contributes to the mean of the Itô process,
while the stochastic integral contributes to the variance.  We'll see how we
can practically manipulate them in the next section.</p>
<p>Lastly as with our other processes, we would like to know its quadratic
variation.  Informally we can compute quadratic variation as:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
dX(t)dX(t) &amp;= \sigma^2(t)dW(t)dW(t) + 2\sigma(t)\mu(t)dW(t)dt + \mu^2(t)dtdt \\
&amp;= \sigma^2(t)dW(t)dW(t) &amp;&amp; \text{Eqn. 2.27/2.28} \\
&amp;= \sigma^2(t)dt &amp;&amp; \text{Quadratic variation of Wiener process} \\
\tag{3.22}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>which is essentially the same computation we used in Equation 3.19 above (and
the same as the variance).  In fact, we get the same result as with the simpler
Wiener process where we accumulate quadratic variation with
<span>\(H^2(t)\)</span> per unit time.  The reason is that the cross variation
(Equation 2.27) and time quadratic variation (Equation 2.28) are zero and don't
contribute to the final expression.</p>
<p>Finally, let's see how to compute an integral of an Itô process <span>\(X(t)\)</span>
using our informal differential notation:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
\int_0^t F(s) dX(s) &amp;= \int_0^t F(s) (\sigma(s)dW(s) + \mu(s)ds) \\
&amp;= \int_0^t [F(s)\sigma(s)dW(s) + F(s)\mu(s)ds] \\
&amp;= \int_0^t F(s)\sigma(s)dW(s) + \int_0^t F(s)\mu(s)ds \\
\tag{3.23}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>As we can see, it's just a sum of a simple Wiener process stochastic integral
and a regular time integral.</p>
<div>
<p>Example 7: A Simple Itô Integral</p>
<p>Starting with our Itô process:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
X(t) = X(0) + \int_0^t A dt + \int_0^t B dW(s) \tag{3.24}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>where <span>\(A, B\)</span> are constant.  Now calculate a simple integral using it as the integrator:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
I(t) = \int_0^t C dX(s) &amp;= \int_0^t AC ds + \int_0^t BC dW(s) \\
     &amp;= AC t + \lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} BC[W(t_{i+1}) - W(t_i)] &amp;&amp; \text{defn. of stochastic integral} \\
     &amp;= AC t + \lim_{||\Pi|| \to 0} BC[W(t) - W(0)] &amp;&amp; \text{telescoping sum} \\
     &amp;= AC t + BC W(t) &amp;&amp; W(0) = 0 \\
\tag{3.25}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>where <span>\(C\)</span> is constant.  From there, we can see that the mean and
variance of this process can be calculated in a straight forward manner
since <span>\(W(t)\)</span> is the only random component:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
E[I(t)] &amp;= E[AC t + BC W(t)] \\
 &amp;= AC t + BC E[W(t)] \\
 &amp;= AC t &amp;&amp; E[W(t)] = 0 \tag{3.26}\\
\\
Var[I(t)] &amp;= E[(I(t) - E[I(t)])^2] \\
 &amp;= E[(BC W(t))^2] \\
 &amp;= (BC)^2 t &amp;&amp; Var(W(t)) = E[W^2(t)] = t \tag{3.27}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>Which is the same result as if we just directly computed Equation 3.20/3.21.
The final result is a simple stochastic process that is essentially
a Wiener process but that drifts up by <span>\(AC\)</span> over time.</p>

<p>As you can see, we can re-write the above stochastic process from Equation 3.28
in terms of a single <span>\(dt\)</span> and single <span>\(dW(s)\)</span> term (using
differential notation).  This can be thought of as a form of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_derivative#Example:_Differentiation_with_direct_dependencies">chain rule for total derivatives</a>,
except now that we have a non-zero quadratic variation, we need to include the
extra second order term involving <span>\(dW(s)dW(s)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Itô's lemma is an incredibly important result because most applications of
stochastic calculus are "little more than repeated use of this formula in a
variety of situations" [1].  In fact, based on what I can tell, many
introductory courses to stochastic calculus skip over a lot of the theoretical
material and simply just jump directly into applications of Itô's lemma because that's
mostly what you need.</p>
<div>
<p>Example 7: Itô's Lemma</p>
<p>Given the Itô process <span>\(X(t)\)</span> as given by Equation 3.16, consider
the stochastic process <span>\(Y(t)\)</span>:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
Y(t) = f(t, X(t)) = X^2(t) + t^2 \tag{3.33}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>Using Itô's Lemma, we can re-write <span>\(Y(t)\)</span> as
(in the differential form since it's cleaner):</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
dY(t) &amp;= df(t, X(S)) = \\
&amp;= \big(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} +
 \mu(t)\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} +
 \frac{\sigma^2(t)}{2}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}\big)dt +
 \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \sigma(t) dW(t)   \\
&amp;= \big(2t + \sigma^2(t) + 2\mu(t)X(t) \big)dt + 2\sigma(t) X(t) dW(t) \\
\tag{3.34}

<h3><a href="#id18"><span>3.4</span> Stochastic Differential Equations</a></h3>
<p>One of the most common problems we want to use stochastic calculus for is
solving stochastic differential equations (SDE). Similar to their non-stochastic
counterpart, they appear in many different phenomenon (a couple of which we
will see in the next section) and are usually very natural to write,
but not necessarily to easy solve.</p>
<p>Starting with the definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>stochastic differential equation</strong> is an equation of the form:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
dX(t) &amp;= \mu(t, X(t))dt + \sigma(t, X(t)) dW(t) &amp;&amp; \text{differential form}\tag{3.35} \\
X(T) &amp;= X(t) + \int_t^T \mu(u, X(u))du + \int_t^T \sigma(u, X(u)) dW(u) &amp;&amp; \text{integral form} \tag{3.36}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>where <span>\(\mu(t, x)\)</span> and <span>\(\sigma(t, x)\)</span> are given functions called
the <em>drift</em> and <em>diffusion</em> respectively.  Additionally, we are given
an initial condition <span>\(X(t) = x\)</span> for <span>\(t\geq 0\)</span>.  The problem is
to then find the stochastic process <span>\(X(T)\)</span> for <span>\(T\geq t\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that <span>\(X(t)\)</span> appears on both sides making it difficult to solve for
explicitly.  A nice property though is that under mild conditions on
<span>\(\mu(t, x)\)</span> and <span>\(\sigma(t, x)\)</span>, there exists a unique process
<span>\(X(T)\)</span> that satisfies the above.  As you might also guess,
one-dimensional, linear SDEs can be solved for explicitly.</p>
<p>SDEs can add similar complexities as their non-stochastic counterparts such as
non-linearities, systems of SDEs, and multidimensional SDEs (with multiple
associated Wiener processes) etc.  Generally, SDEs won't have explicit closed
form solutions so you'll have to use numerical methods to solve them.</p>
<p>The two popular methods are Monte Carlo simulation and numerically solving
a partial differential equation (PDE).  Roughly, Monte Carlo simulation for
differential equations involve simulating many different paths of the
underlying process and using these paths to compute the associated statistics
(e.g., mean, variance etc.).  Given enough paths (and associated time), you
generally can get as accurate as you like.</p>
<p>The other method is to numerically solve a PDE.  An SDE can be recast to as a
PDE problem (at least in finance applications, not sure about others), and from
the PDEs you can use the plethora of numerical methods to solve them.
How both of these methods work is beyond the scope of this post (and how far I
wanted to dig into this subject), but there is a lot of literature online about
it.</p>

the main concepts and intuition (following [6] closely).  See [6] for a
lighter but more intuitive treatment, and [1] for all the gory details.</p>
<div id="the-process-for-a-stock-price">
<h4>
<span>4.1.1</span> The Process for a Stock Price</h4>
<p>Stock prices are probably one of the most natural places where one would think
about using stochastic processes.  We might be tempted to directly use an
Itô process with constant <span>\(\mu\)</span> and <span>\(\sigma\)</span>.  However, this
translates to a linear growth in the stock price, which isn't quite right.
Instead, investors are typically expecting the same <em>percent return</em> regardless
of the current price vs. fixed linear growth.  For example, if a stock's price
is expected to grow at 10%, it should grow at that rate regardless of whether
the price is 10 or 100.  The naturally leads to this differential equation for stock
price <span>\(S\)</span> and constant return <span>\(\mu\)</span> (a pretty big assumption):</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
dS = \mu S dt \tag{4.1}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>The change in growth of the stock price (<span>\(dS\)</span>) is equal to the percent
return of the current price (<span>\(\mu S dt\)</span>).  This yields the solution at
time <span>\(t\)</span> by dividing by <span>\(S\)</span> and integrating both sides:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
S(t) = S_0 e^{\mu t} \tag{4.2}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>Of course, this simplistic model has no random component.  We would expect that
the return is uncertain over a time period.  A (perhaps) reasonable assumption
to make is that for small time periods, the variability in the return is the same
regardless of the stock price.  That is, we are similarly unsure (as a percent of
the stock) of the returns whether it's at 10 or 100.  Using a Wiener process,
we can add this assumption to Equation 4.1 as:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
dS = \mu S dt + \sigma S dW \tag{4.3}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>This results in a stochastic differential equation called <strong>geometric Brownian motion</strong> (GBM).</p>
<p>Fortunately, GBM has a closed form solution that we can derive by using Itô's lemma
on <span>\(f(s) = \log s\)</span>:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
d(\log S) &amp;= \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}dt + \frac{\partial f}{\partial s}dS
+ \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial s^2}dSdS \\
&amp;= 0 + \frac{dS}{S} - \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{S^2} dS dS \\
&amp;= \frac{\mu S dt + \sigma S dW}{S} - \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{S^2}\big(\mu S dt + \sigma S dW\big)\big(\mu S dt + \sigma S dW\big)  &amp;&amp; \text{Eq. 4.3} \\
&amp;= \mu dt + \sigma dW - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}dt &amp;&amp; \text{Eq. 2.27/2.28} \\
&amp;= (\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2})dt + \sigma dW \\
\tag{4.4}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>From that, we know the <span>\(\log S\)</span> process between increment <span>\([0, t]\)</span>
is normally distributed with mean <span>\((\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2})t\)</span> (due to non-zero mean)
and variance <span>\(\sigma^2t\)</span> telling us that:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
\log S \sim \mathcal{N}(\log S(0) + (\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2})t, \sigma^2 t) \tag{4.5}
\end{equation*}

<div id="black-scholes-merton-differential-equation">
<h4>
<span>4.1.2</span> Black-Scholes-Merton Differential Equation</h4>
<p>The BSM model is probably the most famous equation in quantitative finance, but
it actually is quite complex to derive requiring all the stochastic calculus
that we have covered so far.  At the heart of the model is the BSM differential
equation, which we will presently derive and discuss.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is the "no arbitrage" condition.  In the case of
a financial derivative (e.g., call or put option) and the underlying stock, the
price of the derivative should never allow one to make a portfolio of the two
such that you are guaranteed to make money i.e., arbitrage.  In this
theoretical portfolio you can be "long", or buying and <em>owning</em> the financial
security, or "short", <em>owing</em> the financial security but not owning it
(implemented by borrowing the security, selling it, buying it at some later
date, and returning the borrowed security).  A theoretical "short" is
essentially the opposite of buying and owning the asset where you benefit if
the asset goes down.</p>
<p>To build this no arbitrage or "riskless" portfolio, we will want to go long/short the
underlying stock and go short/long the derivative in exact proportion to the
relative change in the asset prices of the two.  This proportion between the
two only exists for a short period of time under that exact condition, and will
need to be rebalanced as market conditions change.</p>
<p>The other key idea is that once you have a "riskless" portfolio set up, it
should return the "risk free" rate (within the short period of time the balance
is maintained).  The risk free rate is an asset that is virtually guaranteed to
receive that given rate (think: a savings account, or more commonly a treasury bond).
With these few conditions and some additional idealized assumptions (e.g.,
stock prices follow the model we developed, no transaction costs, no dividends,
perfect "shorting" etc.), we can formulate the BSM differential equation.</p>
<p>Translating the above into concrete equations, we begin by assuming that stock
prices of a security follow geometric Brownian motion from Equation 4.3:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
dS = \mu S dt + \sigma S dW \tag{4.6}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>An option on that security is some function <span>\(f(S, t)\)</span> of the current
stock price <span>\(S\)</span> and the time <span>\(t\)</span>, using Itô's Lemma we get:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
df = \big(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} +
              \mu \frac{\partial f}{\partial S} S  +
              \frac{\sigma^2 }{2}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial S^2}S^2 \big)dt +
              \frac{\partial f}{\partial S} \sigma S dW \\
              \tag{4.7}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>Equations 4.6/4.7 describe infinitesimal changes in (a) the underlying stock
(<span>\(dS\)</span>), and (b) the change in the underlying financial derivative
(<span>\(df\)</span>).  Notice the Wiener process associated with both is the
same because <span>\(f\)</span> is derived from <span>\(S\)</span>, which can be seen in the
derivation of Itô's Lemma.</p>
<p>With these two equations, we now have SDEs for both the stock price <span>\(S\)</span>
and the price of an option <span>\(f(S, t)\)</span>.  Our goal is to select a portfolio
of the two (at a given time instant and price <span>\(S\)</span>) that doesn't change
regardless of the random fluctuations in price of the underlying stock.  This
can be accomplished by ensuring that the stochastic components (<span>\(dW\)</span>
terms in each SDE) cancel out.  Since the <span>\(dW\)</span> terms are the only source
of randomness, when they are cancelled we can derive an expression for the
portfolio that deterministically changes with time.</p>
<p>Cancelling the stochastic terms is done simply by equating the two <span>\(dW\)</span>
terms in Equations 4.6 and 4.7, which results in taking proportions of
<span>\(-1\)</span> of the financial derivative and <span>\(\frac{\partial f}{\partial S}\)</span>
shares of the underlying stock.  In other words, the portfolio is <em>short</em> one
derivative and long <span>\(\frac{\partial f}{\partial S}\)</span> shares.  Defining our
portfolio value as <span>\(\Pi\)</span>, we get:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
\Pi = -f + \frac{\partial f}{\partial S} S \tag{4.8}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>Taking the differentials, applying Itô's lemma, and plugging in Equation 4.6/4.7:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
d\Pi &amp;= -df + \frac{\partial f}{\partial S} dS \\
     &amp;= -\big(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} +
               \mu \frac{\partial f}{\partial S}S  +
               \frac{\sigma^2 }{2}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial S^2}S^2\big)dt
         - \frac{\partial f}{\partial S} \sigma S dW
       + \frac{\partial f}{\partial S}(\mu S dt + \sigma S dW) \\
     &amp;= -\big(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} +
               \mu \frac{\partial f}{\partial S} S +
               \frac{\sigma^2 }{2}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial S^2}S^2\big)dt
         +\mu \frac{\partial f}{\partial S}S dt &amp;&amp; dW(s) \text{ terms cancel} \\
     &amp;= \big(-\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} -
               \frac{\sigma^2 }{2}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial S^2}S^2\big)dt \\
     \tag{4.9}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>By construction (with our assumptions), <span>\(\Pi\)</span> is a riskless portfolio
(at time instant <span>\(t\)</span>) that deterministically changes with <span>\(t\)</span>.
The assumption of a no arbitrage situation implies that this portfolio must
make the risk free rate.  If this portfolio earns more than the risk free rate
you can just borrow money at the risk free rate and earn the difference between
the two.  If it earns less than the risk free rate then you can just short the
portfolio (and pay the associated lower interest rate) and buy risk free
securities and make the difference.</p>
<p>From this, we expect <span>\(\Pi\)</span> to earn the risk free rate for the
infinitesimal time in which our portfolio is perfectly balanced.
Using Equation 4.9 we can construct an SDE:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
d\Pi &amp;= r\Pi dt \\
\big(-\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} -
               \frac{\sigma^2 }{2}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial S^2}S^2\big)
     &amp;= r(-f + \frac{\partial f}{\partial S} S) dt \\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + rS \frac{\partial f}{\partial S} +
        \frac{\sigma^2}{2}S^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial S^2}
     &amp;= rf \\
 \tag{4.10}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>Equation 4.10 defines the Black-Scholes-Merton differential equation.  Notice
that this is a <em>deterministic</em> differential equation in <span>\(f(S, t)\)</span> because
we have cancelled away the stochastic Wiener process and <span>\(S, t\)</span> are given
with respect to <span>\(f(S, t)\)</span>.  It also has many solutions corresponding to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_value_problem">boundary conditions</a>
placed on <span>\(f(S, t)\)</span>.  For example,
<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeanoption.asp">European call and put options</a>
have these associated boundary conditions for strike price <span>\(K\)</span> and
expiry time <span>\(T\)</span>:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
f(S, t) &amp;= \max(S-K, 0) \text{ when } t = T \tag{4.11} &amp;&amp; \text{European call} \\
f(S, t) &amp;= \max(K-S, 0) \text{ when } t = T \tag{4.12} &amp;&amp; \text{European put}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>In other words, when the call option contract expires, it is worth precisely the
difference between the stock price and strike price or zero if negative
(similarly in reverse for put options).</p>
<p>Solving this differential equation with these boundary conditions results
in the most famous formulas that you'll find when searching for BSM (see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model#Black%E2%80%93Scholes_formula">here</a> for more details).
I won't go into all the details since that's not the focus of this post, but
the fact that it has a closed form solution is a big plus.  There are many
more complex quantitative finance models that do not have closed form solutions,
and even ones that go beyond Itô processes (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_process">Jump Processes</a>).  These models require approximate solutions as discussed in

<div id="langevin-equation">
<h3><a href="#id21"><span>4.2</span> Langevin Equation</a></h3>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langevin_equation">Langevin equation</a> is a
well known stochastic differential equation that describes how a system evolves
when subjected to a combination of deterministic and fluctuating forces.  The
original equation was developed well before stochastic calculus was discovered
in the context of the apparent random movement of a particle through a fluid,
which describes the physical phenomenon of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">Brownian motion</a>.  Since the
Wiener process and Brownian motion are so related, they are sometimes used
interchangeably to describe the underlying stochastic process.</p>
<p>Many people contributed to the discovery of Brownian motion (including
Einstein) but the stochastic differential equation was derived several years
after by Langevin (hence the name) in 1908.  Interestingly, since Langevin
did not approach his stochastic differential equation with much rigour (by
mathematician standards), this gave rise to the field of stochastic analysis to
answer some of the issues with Langevin's approach.</p>
<p>In this section, I'm going to give a brief overview of the Langevin equation
in the context of Brownian motion, glossing over many of the usual analyses one
would do in a physics class.  Additionally, I'm going to approach it using Itô
calculus, which is not the typical approach (not the one originally used).
Finally, I'll briefly mention its relationship to a financial application.</p>
<div id="brownian-motion-and-the-langevin-equation">
<h4>
<span>4.2.1</span> Brownian Motion and the Langevin Equation</h4>
<p>The original Langevin equation describes the random movement of a (usually much
larger) particle suspended in a fluid due to collisions with the molecules of
the fluid:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
m\frac{d{\bf v_t}}{dt} = -\lambda {\bf v_t} + {\bf \eta}(t) \tag{4.13}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>where <span>\(m\)</span> is the mass, <span>\(\bf v_t\)</span> is the velocity,
<span>\(\frac{d{\bf v_t}}{dt}\)</span> is the acceleration (the time derivative of velocity),
and <span>\(\bf \eta\)</span> is a white noise term with zero mean and flat frequency spectrum
(the same one we discussed in Section 2.5).
The easiest way to interpret this equation is using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion#Second">Newton's second law</a> of motion:
the net force on an object is equal to its mass times acceleration (<span>\(F_{net} = ma\)</span>).
The right hand side is the net force, and the left hand side is the product of
mass and acceleration.</p>
<p>Breaking it down further, there are two types of forces acting on our particle
suspended in a fluid: (a) a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_law">drag force</a>
of the fluid that is proportional to its velocity (think something analogous to air
resistance), and (b) a noise term representing the effect of random collisions
with the small fluid molecules.  This is a bit strange because we're combining the
microscopic (drag force acting on the particle) with a seemingly macroscopic
average from the noise.  This needs a bit of explanation.</p>
<p>The noise term is an approximation of sorts.  For any given time instant, there
(theoretically) are specific molecules colliding with our target particle so
why are we considering this noise term <span>\(\bf \eta\)</span>?  Besides simplifying
the math, the justification is that it is a good approximation for the
<em>average</em> force within a small time instant because of the scale of our
observations.  Our instruments do not have infinite precision and only measure
finitely small time intervals, this means the resulting observations are really
an average over these small finite time intervals and look a lot like the white
noise term in Equation 4.13.  So while not exact (like any model), it provides
a pretty good approximation for this phenomenon (and many others with some
variations on the basic equation).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the noise term was not precisely defined (i.e., mathematically
rigorous) when Langevin wrote his original equations.  However with the advent
of stochastic calculus, we can write an equivalent stochastic differential
equation, which is often referred to as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process">Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process</a>
as:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
d{\bf v_t} = -\theta v_t dt + \sigma dW \tag{4.14}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>where <span>\(\theta, \sigma\)</span> are constants, and assume <span>\(\eta(t) =
\frac{dW}{dt}\)</span>.  As an aside, technically, the Wiener process is nowhere
differentiable, so <span>\(\frac{dW}{dt}\)</span> does not have a precise meaning, which
is why we rarely write it in this form and instead use the differential form of
Equation 4.14.</p>
<p>Equation 4.14 is complicated by the fact that we have our target process
<span>\(v_t\)</span> mixed in with differentials and non-differentials
i.e., a stochastic differential equation.  Since this is a relatively
simple SDE, we can use similar techniques to solving their non-stochastic
counterparts along with Itô's lemma to compute the differential.</p>
<p>Without going into all of the reasoning behind it, we'll start with the function
<span>\(f(t, v_t) = v_t e^{\theta t}\)</span>, write down its differential and its Taylor
expansion similar to our (informal) derivation of Itô's lemma:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
df(v_t, t) &amp;= \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}dt + \frac{\partial f}{\partial v_t} dv_t
             + \frac{1}{2} (\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial v_t^2})^2 dv_t dv_t \\
&amp;= \theta v_t e^{\theta t} dt + e^{\theta t} dv_t + (0)dv_t dv_t \\
&amp;= \theta v_t e^{\theta t} dt + e^{\theta t} (-\theta v_t dt + \sigma dW) &amp;&amp; \text{Equation 4.14} \\
&amp;= \sigma e^{\theta t} dW \\
\int_0^t df &amp;= v_0 +  \int_0^t \sigma e^{\theta s} dW \\
v_t e^{\theta t} &amp;= v_0 + \int_0^t \sigma e^{\theta s} dW \\
v_t &amp;= v_0e^{-\theta t} + \sigma \int_0^t e^{-\theta (t-s)} dW \\ \tag{4.15}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>Which shows the general solution to our stochastic differential equation.
We can characterize this stochastic process by evaluating its mean and variance.
First, we use the fact that an
<a href="https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/53212/integration-of-a-deterministic-function-w-r-t-a-brownian-motion">Itô integral of a deterministic integrand is normally distributed</a>,
thus the second term in Equation 4.15 has zero mean, and so (assuming a non-random initial velocity <span>\(v_0\)</span>):</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
E[v_t] &amp;= E[v_0e^{-\theta t}] + E[\sigma \int_0^t e^{-\theta (t-s)} dW] \\
 &amp;= v_0e^{-\theta t} \\
 \tag{4.16}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>Showing the average velocity vanishes relatively quickly over time.  Next, we
can compute the variance using Itô's isometry (Theorem 4 above):</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
Var(v_t) &amp;= E[(v_t - E[v_t])(v_t - E[v_t])] \\
&amp;= E\big[(\sigma \int_0^t e^{-\theta (t-s)} dW)^2] \\
&amp;= \sigma^2 E\big[\int_0^t (e^{-\theta (t-s)})^2 ds] &amp;&amp; \text{Itô's isometry} \\
&amp;= \frac{\sigma^2}{2\theta}(1 - e^{-2\theta t}) \\
\tag{4.17}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>From the mean and variance, and the fact the integrator in <span>\(v_t\)</span> is normally distributed,
we can infer that the stochastic process is one with a scaled and shifted Wiener process:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
v_t = v_0 e^{-\theta t} + \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2\theta}}W(1-e^{-2\theta t}) \tag{4.18}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>Similarly, we can compute the displacement <span>\(x_t\)</span> by integrating
<span>\(v_t\)</span> with respect to time:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
x_t &amp;= \int_0^t v_t dt \\
    &amp;= \int_0^t v_0 e^{-\theta s} ds + \int_0^t \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2\theta}}W(1-e^{-2\theta s}) ds \\
    &amp;= \frac{v_0}{\theta} (1 - e^{-\theta t}) + \int_0^t \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2\theta}}W(1-e^{-2\theta s}) ds \\
    \tag{4.19}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>I won't expand the last time integral, but you can calculate it using the explanation in <a href="https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/29504/integral-of-brownian-motion-w-r-t-time">this
StackExchange answer</a>,
which has a zero mean.  Thus, the average displacement asymptotes to <span>\(\frac{v_0}{\theta}\)</span> over time.

<h2><a href="#id22"><span>5</span> Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Well I did it again!  I went down a rabbit hole, and before I knew it I was
in over my head on this topic.  In a lot of ways it's nice learning on your own time
because you can meander.  I will say I had no idea what I was getting myself into
when I started to write this post.  Little did I know I would have to learn
more about measure theoretic probability theory (something that was never a
priority for me), nor that stochastic calculus needed so technical depth in order
to intuitively understand the underlying math (vs. just symbol manipulation).
In any case, I'm glad I dug into it but I'll be happy when I can get back on
track to more standard ML topics.  Until next time!</p>

<h2><a href="#id24"><span>7</span> Appendix A: Event Space and Probability Measure for a Bernoulli Process</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned the sample space for the Bernoulli process is all infinite
sequences of heads and tails: <span>\(\Omega = \{ (a_n)_1^{\infty} : a_n \in {H, T} \}\)</span>.
The first thing to mention about this sample space is that it is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncountable_set">uncountable</a>,
which basically means it is "larger" than the natural numbers.
Reasoning in infinities is quite unnatural but the two frequent "infinities"
that usually pop up are sets that have the same
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality">cardinality</a> ("size") as
(a) the natural numbers, and (b) the real numbers.
Our sample space has the same cardinality as the latter.
Cantor's original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument">diagonalization argument</a>
actually used a variation of this sample space (with <span>\(\{0, 1\}\)</span>'s), and
the proof is relatively intuitive.
In any case, this complicates things because a lot of our intuition falls apart
when we work with infinites, and especially with infinities that have the cardinality of the
real numbers.</p>
<p><em>(This construction was taken from [1], which is a dense, but informative reference for all the topics in this post.)</em></p>
<p>Now we will construct the event space (<span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra) and probability
measure for the Bernoulli process.  We'll do it iteratively.  First, let's define
<span>\(P(\emptyset) = 0\)</span> and <span>\(P(\Omega) = 1\)</span>, and the corresponding (trivial)
event space:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{F}_0 = \{\emptyset, \Omega\} \tag{A.1}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>Notice that <span>\(\mathcal{F}_0\)</span> is a <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra.  Next, let's
define two sets:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
A_H &amp;= \text{the set of all sequences beginning with } H = \{\omega: \omega_1 = H\} \\
A_T &amp;= \text{the set of all sequences beginning with } T = \{\omega: \omega_1 = T\} \\
\tag{A.2}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>And set the intuitive definition of the corresponding probability measure:
<span>\(P(A_H) = p\)</span> and <span>\(P(A_T) = 1-p\)</span>.  That is, the probability of
seeing an H on the first toss is <span>\(p\)</span>, otherwise <span>\(1-p\)</span>.
Since these two sets are compliments of each other (<span>\(A_H = A_T^c\)</span>),
this defines another <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{F}_1 = \{\emptyset, \Omega, A_H, A_T\} \tag{A.3}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>We can repeat this process again but for the first two tosses, define sets:</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
A_{HH} &amp;= \text{the set of all sequences beginning with } HH = \{\omega: \omega_1\omega_2 = HH\} \\
A_{HT} &amp;= \text{the set of all sequences beginning with } HT = \{\omega: \omega_1\omega_2 = HT\} \\
A_{TH} &amp;= \text{the set of all sequences beginning with } TH = \{\omega: \omega_1\omega_2 = TH\} \\
A_{TT} &amp;= \text{the set of all sequences beginning with } TT = \{\omega: \omega_1\omega_2 = TT\} \\
\tag{A.4}
\end{align*}
</p>
<p>Similarly, we can extend our probability measure with the definition we would expect:
<span>\(P(A_{HH}) = p^2, P(A_{HT}) = p(1-p), P(A_{TH}) = p(1-p), P(A_{TT}) = (1-p)^2\)</span>.
Now we have to do a bit more analysis, but if one works out every possible set we can
create either from compliments or unions of any of the above sets, we'll find
that we have 16 in total.  For each one of them, we can compute its probability
measure by using one of the above definitions or by the fact that <span>\(P(A) = 1-P(A)\)</span>
or <span>\(P\big(\bigcup_{n=1}^{N} A_N \big) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} P(A_N)\)</span> if the sets
are disjoint.  These 16 sets define our next <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{F}_2 = \left. \begin{cases}
        \emptyset, \Omega, A_H, A_T, A_{HH}, A_{HT}, A_{TH}, A_{TT}, A_{HH}^c, A_{HT}^c, A_{TH}^c, A_{TT}^c \\
        A_{HH} \bigcup A_{TH}, A_{HH} \bigcup A_{TT}, A_{HT} \bigcup A_{TH}, A_{HT} \bigcup A_{TT}
    \end{cases} \right\} \tag{A.5}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>As you can imagine, we can continue this process and define the probability (and associated
<span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra) for every set in terms of finitely many tosses.  Let's call
this set <span>\(\mathcal{F}_\infty\)</span>, which contains all of the sets that can be described
by <em>any number</em> of finitely many coin tosses using the procedure above, and then adding in all the
other ones using the compliment or union operator.  This turns out to be precisely
the <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra of the Bernoulli process.  And by the construction,
we also have defined the associated probability measure for each one of the events
in <span>\(\mathcal{F}_\infty\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we could leave it there, but let's take a look at the non-intuitive things that go
on when we work with infinities.  This definition implicitly includes sequences
that weren't explicitly defined by us, for example, the sequence of all heads:
<span>\(H, H, H, H, \ldots\)</span>.  But we can see this sequence is included in
<span>\(A_H, A_{HH}, A_{HHH}, \ldots\)</span>.  Further, we have:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
P(A_H) = p, P(A_{HH})=p^2, P(A_{HHH})=p^3, \ldots \tag{A.6}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>so this implies the probability of <span>\(P(\text{sequence of all heads}) = 0\)</span>.
This illustrates an important non-intuitive result: all (infinite) sequences in our sample
space have probability <span>\(0\)</span>.  Importantly, it doesn't mean they can never occur,
just that they occur "infinitesimally".  Similarly, the complement ("sequences
of at least one tails") happens with probability <span>\(1\)</span>.
Mathematicians have a name for this probability equals to <span>\(1\)</span> event: <em>almost
surely</em>.  So any infinite sequence of coin flips <em>almost surely</em> has at least one
tail.  For finite event spaces, there is not difference between surely (always
happens) and almost surely.</p>
<p>This definition also includes sets of sequences that cannot be easily defined such
as:</p>
<p>
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{H_n(\omega_1\ldots\omega_n)}{n} = \frac{1}{2} \tag{A.7}
\end{equation*}
</p>
<p>where <span>\(H_n\)</span> denotes the number of heads in the <span>\(n\)</span> tosses.  This
can be implicitly constructed by taking (countably infinite) unions and intersections
of sets that we have defined in our <span>\(A_\ldots\)</span> event space.  See Example
1.1.4 from [1] for more details.</p>
<p>Finally, although it may seem that we will have defined every subset of our
sample space, there does exist sequences that are not in
<span>\(\mathcal{F}_\infty\)</span>.  But it's extremely hard to produce such a set
(and don't ask me how :p).</p>
<dl>
<dt id="id4"><span><a href="#id1">1</a></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>I'm conveniently leaving out references to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_integration">Lebesgue integrals</a> (among other things) to not overcomplicate the topic. They are quite important and are needed to work properly with random variables where you need to integrate over a set.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="id5"><span><a href="#id3">2</a></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>In fact, we can admit a larger class of integrators for stochastic integrals called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semimartingale">semimartingales</a>, but for our purposes Itô processes will do just fine.</p>
