<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="04f7954960b1">For the past two weeks, I’ve been spending most of my time rewriting our CI scripts in GitHub Actions. This is the third time we’ve had to redo our CI setup—first GitHub Actions, then <a href="https://earthly.dev/">Earthly</a> (which we moved away from because it was discontinued), and now, reluctantly, back to GitHub Actions.</p><p id="07dc3a94dbeb">Our CI is complex: merge queues, multiple runners (self-hosted, <a href="https://blacksmith.sh/">blacksmith.sh</a>, GitHub-hosted), Rust builds, Docker images, and heavy integration tests. Every PR we merge burns through an hour of CI time, running across multiple parallel runners.</p><p id="8c6854fbbe43">There are a few things we'd like to have (which we deem as "good software practice") but it's nothing unheard of:</p><ol><li>Everything that goes into `main` must pass all tests.</li><li>Trivial mistakes (formatting, unused deps, lint issues) should be fixed automatically, not cause failures.</li><li>The artifacts we test with in CI should be the exact ones we release.</li><li>CI should complete quickly (to keep developers happy).</li></ol><p id="834216755732">GitHub Actions technically allows all of this—but setting it up is a frustrating mess, full of hidden gotchas, inconsistent behavior, and a debugging experience that makes me question my choices.</p><h3 id="56a4dbb8bf83">Strange Way to Enforce Status Checks with Merge Queue</h3><p id="fd16fccbbdb2">The key to enforcing a clean <code>main</code> branch is GitHub’s <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue">merge queue</a>, which rebases a PR onto <code>main</code> before running CI. Sounds great. But here’s the fun part:</p><ul><li>We need CI to run <em>before</em> entering the queue to auto-fix trivial issues.</li><li>We need CI to run <em>again</em> inside the queue to verify the final merge.</li><li>GitHub Actions makes it weirdly hard to require both runs to pass.</li></ul><p id="8e1619327bba">The solution? <strong>Name the jobs identically</strong> in both phases. That’s it. GitHub treats them as the same check, so they both need to succeed. Solved by reading this answer in a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76655935/when-does-a-github-workflow-trigger-for-merge-group-and-is-it-restricted-by-bran/78030618#78030618">Stack Overflow post</a> after a few hours of debugging. Any other way you try to do this leads to either status checks being awaited before you put something in the queue (so it never starts the job) or worse, things just get merged even if the job you'd like to pass in the merge queue fails.</p><h3 id="d7687fc57c00">A security nightmare?</h3><p id="e118b355141b">A few days ago, someone <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43368870">compromised a popular GitHub Action</a>. The response? "Just pin your dependencies to a hash." Except as comments also pointed out, almost no one does.</p><p id="be904b86b98a">Even setting aside supply chain attacks, GitHub’s security model is a confusing maze to me: My point of view is that if I can't understand a security model easily it's probably doomed to fail or break at some point. Disclaimer: I'm writing this as a github actions user with only a vague understanding of it so I'd be delighted to hear that it is not just "things piled on top of things until it's safe", which is my current impression. I do understand very well that the problem of having secure CI for distributed source control is complicated.</p><p id="57fa6b17ef27">In github, there is a "default" token called <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code>. The way it works is that it gets initialized with some default permissions. You can set that default in the settings of your repository (under Actions -&gt; General -&gt; Workflow Permissions). Here is what the github documentation says about it:</p><blockquote><p>If the default permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN are restrictive, you may have to elevate the permissions to allow some actions and commands to run successfully. If the default permissions are permissive, you can edit the workflow file to remove some permissions from the GITHUB_TOKEN.</p><span>- Github Documenation</span></blockquote><p id="34005ba8540c">Removing permission that aren't necessary sounds nice (though I do think a better "default" would be to start with <strong>no privileges</strong> and require the user to add whatever is needed). Unfortunately, there are <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions">many of them</a> and it's hardly clear for all of them what they are protecting if you're not a github expert.</p><p id="39fa8482d7a0">Your workflow permissions also don’t really depend on the action itself. Here is an example of such an instance, I'm using <code>softprops/action-gh-release</code> to automatically create a new release on github</p><div><pre><code><span>-</span><span> </span><span>name:</span><span> </span><span>Release</span><span> </span><span>on</span><span> </span><span>GitHub</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>if:</span><span> </span><span>env.version_exists</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>'false'</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>uses:</span><span> </span><span>softprops/action-gh-release@v2</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>with:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>tag_name:</span><span> </span><span>v${{</span><span> </span><span>env.CURRENT_VERSION</span><span> </span><span>}}</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>generate_release_notes:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>make_latest:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>token:</span><span> </span><span>${{</span><span> </span><span>secrets.CI_RELEASE</span><span> </span><span>}}</span></code></pre></div><p id="1acd29788f81">Why do I need a custom token? Because without it, the release completes, but doesn’t trigger our post-release workflow. The sad part is that you don't get any indication about it until you eventually <a href="https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release/issues/59">find an issue</a> where someone had the same problem and that leads you in the right direction.</p><p id="cfe2d1a4c40f">You can also elevate permissions in your workflow yaml file. That seems like a strange thing to do inside the code you're trying to protect. At least there are some limitations according to the github docs:</p><p id="daddc3d76619">You can use the <code>permissions</code> key to add and remove read permissions for forked repositories, but typically you can't grant write access. The exception to this behavior is where an admin user has selected the <strong>Send write tokens to workflows from pull requests</strong> option in the GitHub Actions settings. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#enabling-workflows-for-private-repository-forks">Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository</a>.</p><p id="678e558d777b">This is just one of many instances which I believe is the root of what makes the github actions security model so obscure: there are too many pitfalls accompanied by exceptions that you have to account for. Clearly the system is very powerful and allows you to do many things but it also expands the attack surface for breaking things.</p><p id="e00abccbfba2">As far as I can tell I'm not alone in this. Another instance of the same problem I ran into is when I read <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners">this paragraph</a> where they recommend that you don't use self-hosted runners in public repositories:</p><blockquote><p>We recommend that you only use self-hosted runners with private repositories. This is because forks of your public repository can potentially run dangerous code on your self-hosted runner machine by creating a pull request that executes the code in a workflow.</p><span>- Github Documentation</span></blockquote><p id="20e7090b06ce">However, github also has a setting for self-hosted runners where pull-requests from external collaborators need to be approved before running. A practical question that comes up for me is "are self-hosted runners in combination with this setting safe"? I do believe so, but github documentation doesn't say and there is no consensus in the rest of the internet about it. It's hard to be 100% confident given how much complexity there is. Even github documentation writers don't seem to understand their security model anymore.</p><h3 id="33b01436e240">Docker and Github Actions, an Unholy Combination</h3><p id="4ea29a97fd50">If you thought GitHub Actions was bad, try mixing in Docker.</p><p id="3cc29b3a3a20">GitHub lets you <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-where-your-workflow-runs/running-jobs-in-a-container">run jobs inside a container</a>. This is great in theory—you can prepackage dependencies into a dev container instead of installing them every run. In practice:</p><ol><li>File permissions break constantly. A container builds files as one user, but GitHub runners may use another (different uid and gid) to run it. So it may be unable to either access the files in the container or in the github workspace and temporary host directories that get mounted.</li><li>The <code>$HOME</code> directory moves. Your dev container may install tools into <code>/home/ubuntu</code>, but inside GitHub Actions, it’s suddenly <code>/github/home</code>. Tools that rely on files in <code>$HOME</code> may no longer find them.</li><li>Any action that interacts with the host system might break now. For example, I use <a href="https://docs.blacksmith.sh/github-actions-runners/sticky-disks">blacksmith’s sticky disk action</a> to mount an NVMe drive for caching (since GitHub caches are limited to 10GB). It didn’t work inside a container until <a href="https://docs.blacksmith.sh/github-actions-runners/sticky-disks#using-sticky-disks-inside-a-container">they made a fix for me</a> (thanks to Aditya Jayaprakash from blacksmith.sh for the one day turn-around time on this!).</li></ol><p id="37c2cef1c9a2">Meanwhile, the <code>container</code> field itself has weird limitations. Want to override the entrypoint? Nope. Want to run <em>some</em> steps inside a container and others outside? Nope.</p><h3 id="15cb942fcdc2">Developing Workflows with YAML</h3><p id="8e060b2d72ac">All of this logic you end up writing in YAML can unfortunately get complicated pretty quickly and you're bound to make mistakes. I was using RustRover as my IDE when writing the YAML which had some linter checks for github YAML built-in and it helped a lot. I still found myself wishing for much better static checking for all of this. It doesn't help that you can't really try any of this locally (I know of <a href="https://github.com/nektos/act">act</a> but it only supports a small subset of the things you're trying to do in CI). I found that the best way to debug CI is to create an identical repo to the one you're trying to make changes for and do <code>git commit -a -m "wip" &amp;&amp; git push test-ci branch</code> until CI works as expected.</p><p id="d0bc10f501f0">Since I didn't want to run the whole CI pipeline every time I made a change, I tried to keep individual workflows small and have them push artifacts at the end of their steps, then subsequent workflows could download the artifacts and re-use them instead of rebuilding everything from scratch. This lets you test workflows in isolation because you can just download artifacts from a previous run until it works (of course when downloading from a previous run one needs to provide a token to the download-artifact action, but this can just be the default token. Why does it still need to be provided then is yet another unsolved mystery...).</p><p id="215acba7bd25">The main workflow file then becomes a chain of invoking other YAML files:</p><div><pre><code><span>jobs:</span><span>  
</span>  invoke-build-rust:  
<span></span><span>    name:</span><span> Build Rust  
</span><span></span><span>    uses:</span><span> ./.github</span><span>/workflows/</span><span>build-rust.yml  
</span>  
<!-- -->  invoke-build-java:  
<span></span><span>    name:</span><span> Build Java

</span><span></span><span>    secrets:</span><span> inherit  
</span>

</span><span></span><span>    uses:</span><span> ./.github</span><span>/workflows/</span><span>build-docker.yml  
</span>  
<!-- -->  invoke-tests-integration:  
<span></span><span>    name:</span><span> Integration Tests

</span><span></span><span>    uses:</span><span> ./.github</span><span>/workflows/</span><span>test-java.yml</span></code></pre></div><p id="4af0c99d7aac">Notice the <code>secrets: inherit</code> added to some jobs. Another gotcha that took me too long to figure out. Every time when I ran the entire CI pipeline things wouldn't work but when I ran the steps individually they would work just fine (that's because when you call a workflow from another workflow secrets aren't shared by default).</p><p id="a9a473aa7f3d">There are many more gotchas I wanted to write about, but the post is already quite long. Overall, I'm still happy with <a href="https://github.com/feldera/feldera/tree/main/.github/workflows">our new CI scripts</a> because it reduced the time to merge significantly for us. I just wish the process to get there would be less time-consuming and that it would be easier to debug when things go wrong. I guess, I'm hoping for some innovation here.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                        To do so, we first generate the scene appearance and geometry using a multi-view diffusion
                        model.
                        Then, Splatter Images are regressed using a Gaussian Head.
                        3D Gaussians from multiple Splatter Images are combined to form the 3D scene.

                        Compare the renders of our method Bolt3D (right) with feed-forward and optimization-based
                        methods (left).
                        Our method gives feed-forward 3D reconstruction models generative capabilities,
                        and significantly reduces inference cost compared to optimization-based methods.
                        Try selecting different methods and scenes!

answer</p></li><li><p>FINISHES: The task is complete!</p></li></ul></li></ol><p>This is exactly what our code will do - just expressed in programming language.</p><p>Let's build each of these stations one by one and then connect them together!</p><p><span>The </span><strong>DecideAction</strong><span> node is like the "brain" of our agent. Its job is simple:</span></p><ol><li><p>Look at the question and any information we've gathered so far</p></li><li><p>Decide whether we need to search for more information or if we can answer now</p></li></ol><p>Let's build it step by step:</p><pre><code><code>class DecideAction(Node):
    def prep(self, shared):
        # Think of "shared" as a big notebook that everyone can read and write in
        # It's where we store everything our agent knows

        # Look for any previous research we've done (if we haven't searched yet, just note that)
        context = shared.get("context", "No previous search")

        # Get the question we're trying to answer
        question = shared["question"]

        # Return both pieces of information for the next step
        return question, context</code></code></pre><p><span>First, we created a </span><code>prep</code><span> method that gathers information. Think of </span><code>prep</code><span> like a chef gathering ingredients before cooking. All it does is look at what we already know (our "context") and what question we're trying to answer.</span></p><p>Now, let's build the "thinking" part:</p><pre><code><code>    def exec(self, inputs):
        # This is where the magic happens - the LLM "thinks" about what to do
        question, context = inputs

        # We ask the LLM to decide what to do next with this prompt:
        prompt = f"""
### CONTEXT
You are a research assistant that can search the web.
Question: {question}
Previous Research: {context}

### ACTION SPACE
[1] search
  Description: Look up more information on the web
  Parameters:
    - query (str): What to search for

[2] answer
  Description: Answer the question with current knowledge
  Parameters:
    - answer (str): Final answer to the question

## NEXT ACTION
Decide the next action based on the context and available actions.
Return your response in this format:

```yaml
thinking: |
    &lt;your step-by-step reasoning process&gt;
action: search OR answer
reason: &lt;why you chose this action&gt;
search_query: &lt;specific search query if action is search&gt;
```"""

        # Call the LLM to make a decision
        response = call_llm(prompt)

        # Pull out just the organized information part from the LLM's answer
        # (This is like finding just the recipe part of a cooking video)
        yaml_str = response.split("```yaml")[1].split("```")[0].strip()
        decision = yaml.safe_load(yaml_str)  # Convert the text into a format our program can use

        return decision</code></code></pre><p><span>The </span><code>exec</code><span> method is where the actual "thinking" happens. Think of it like the chef cooking the ingredients. Here, we:</span></p><ol><li><p>Create a prompt that explains the current situation to the LLM</p></li><li><p>Ask the LLM to decide whether to search or answer</p></li><li><p>Parse the response to get a clear decision</p></li></ol><p>Finally, let's save the decision and tell the flow what to do next:</p><pre><code><code>    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
        # If the LLM decided to search, save the search query
        if exec_res["action"] == "search":
            shared["search_query"] = exec_res["search_query"]

        # Return which action to take - this tells our flow where to go next!
        return exec_res["action"]  # Will be either "search" or "answer"</code></code></pre><p><span>The </span><code>post</code><span> method is where we save results and decide what happens next. Think of it like the chef serving the food and deciding what dish to prepare next. We save the search query if needed, and then return either "search" or "answer" to tell our flow which node to visit next.</span></p><p><span>The </span><strong>SearchWeb</strong><span> node is our "researcher." Its only job is to:</span></p><ol><li><p>Take a search query</p></li><li><p>Look it up (in this simple example, we'll fake the results)</p></li><li><p>Save what it finds</p></li><li><p>Tell the agent to decide what to do with this new information</p></li></ol><p>Let's build it:</p><pre><code><code>class SearchWeb(Node):
    def prep(self, shared):
        # Simply get the search query we saved earlier
        return shared["search_query"]</code></code></pre><p><span>The </span><code>prep</code><span> method here just grabs the search query that was saved by the DecideAction node.</span></p><pre><code><code>    def exec(self, search_query):
        # This is where we'd connect to Google to search the internet
        # Set up our connection to Google
        search_client = GoogleSearchAPI(api_key="GOOGLE_API_KEY")

        # Set search parameters
        search_params = {
            "query": search_query,
            "num_results": 3,
            "language": "en"
        }

        # Make the API request to Google
        results = search_client.search(search_params)

        # Format the results into readable text
        formatted_results = f"Results for: {search_query}\n"

        # Process each search result
        for result in results:
            # Extract the title and snippet from each result
            formatted_results += f"- {result.title}: {result.snippet}\n"

        return formatted_results</code></code></pre><p><span>The </span><code>exec</code><span> method connects to a search API, sends the query, and formats the results. In a real implementation, you would need to sign up for a search API service like Google Custom Search API and get your own API key.</span></p><pre><code><code>    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
        # Store the search results in our shared whiteboard
        previous = shared.get("context", "")
        shared["context"] = previous + "\n\nSEARCH: " + shared["search_query"] + "\nRESULTS: " + exec_res

        # Always go back to the decision node after searching
        return "decide"</code></code></pre><p><span>The </span><code>post</code><span> method saves our search results by adding them to our shared context. Then it returns "decide" to tell our flow to go back to the DecideAction node so it can think about what to do with this new information.</span></p><p><span>The </span><strong>AnswerQuestion</strong><span> node is our "responder." Its job is simply to:</span></p><ol><li><p>Take all the information we've gathered</p></li><li><p>Create a friendly, helpful answer</p></li><li><p>Save that answer for the user</p></li></ol><p>Let's build it:</p><pre><code><code>class AnswerQuestion(Node):
    def prep(self, shared):
        # Get both the original question and all the research we've done
        return shared["question"], shared.get("context", "")</code></code></pre><p><span>The </span><code>prep</code><span> method gathers both the original question and all the research we've collected.</span></p><pre><code><code>    def exec(self, inputs):
        question, context = inputs
        # Ask the LLM to create a helpful answer based on our research
        prompt = f"""
### CONTEXT
Based on the following information, answer the question.
Question: {question}
Research: {context}

## YOUR ANSWER:
Provide a comprehensive answer using the research results.
"""
        return call_llm(prompt)</code></code></pre><p><span>The </span><code>exec</code><span> method asks the LLM to create a helpful answer based on our research.</span></p><pre><code><code>    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
        # Save the answer in our shared whiteboard
        shared["answer"] = exec_res

        # We're done! No need to continue the flow.
        return "done"</code></code></pre><p><span>The </span><code>post</code><span> method saves the final answer and returns "done" to indicate that our flow is complete.</span></p><p>Now for the fun part - we need to connect all our nodes together to create a working agent!</p><pre><code><code># First, create instances of each node
decide = DecideAction()
search = SearchWeb()
answer = AnswerQuestion()

# Now connect them together - this is where the magic happens!
# Each connection defines where to go based on the action returned by post()

# If DecideAction returns "search", go to SearchWeb
decide - "search" &gt;&gt; search

# If DecideAction returns "answer", go to AnswerQuestion
decide - "answer" &gt;&gt; answer

# After SearchWeb completes, go back to DecideAction
search - "decide" &gt;&gt; decide

# Create our flow, starting with the DecideAction node
flow = Flow(start=decide)</code></code></pre><p>That's it! We've connected our nodes into a complete flow that can:</p><ol><li><p>Start by deciding what to do</p></li><li><p>Search for information if needed</p></li><li><p>Loop back to decide if we need more information</p></li><li><p>Answer the question when we're ready</p></li></ol><p>Think of it like a flowchart where each box is a node, and the arrows show where to go next based on decisions made along the way.</p><p>Now let's see our agent in action:</p><pre><code><code># Create a shared whiteboard with just a question
shared = {"question": "What is the capital of France?"}

# Run our flow!
flow.run(shared)

# Print the final answer
print(shared["answer"])</code></code></pre><p>Here's what happens when our agent runs:</p><p>First, our agent thinks about the question:</p><pre><code><code>thinking: |
  The question is asking about the capital of France. I don't have any prior search results to work with.
  To answer this question accurately, I should search for information about France's capital.
action: search
reason: I need to look up information about the capital of France
search_query: capital of France</code></code></pre><p>Our agent decides it doesn't know enough yet, so it needs to search for information.</p><p>The SearchWeb node now searches for "capital of France" and gets these results:</p><pre><code><code>Results for: capital of France
- The capital of France is Paris
- Paris is known as the City of Light</code></code></pre><p>It saves these results to our shared context.</p><p>Our agent looks at the question again, but now it has some search results:</p><pre><code><code>thinking: |
  Now I have search results that clearly state "The capital of France is Paris".
  This directly answers the question, so I can provide a final answer.
action: answer
reason: I now have the information needed to answer the question</code></code></pre><p>This time, our agent decides it has enough information to answer!</p><p>Finally, the AnswerQuestion node generates a helpful response:</p><pre><code><code>The capital of France is Paris, which is also known as the City of Light.</code></code></pre><p>And we're done! Our agent has successfully:</p><ol><li><p>Realized it needed to search for information</p></li><li><p>Performed a search</p></li><li><p>Decided it had enough information</p></li><li><p>Generated a helpful answer</p></li></ol><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg" width="800" height="552" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:552,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;The Whole Process Visualized&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="The Whole Process Visualized" title="The Whole Process Visualized" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>If you’re technically inclined and want to read or experiment with the complete code for this tutorial, you can find it </span><a href="https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow/tree/main/cookbook/pocketflow-agent" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">here</a><span>!</span></p><p>You can also see how this same loop-and-branch pattern appears in larger frameworks by checking out these snippets:</p><ul><li><p><strong>OpenAI Agents</strong><span>: </span><a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/48ff99bb736249e99251eb2c7ecf00237488c17a/src/agents/run.py#L119" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">run.py#L119</a><span> for a workflow in graph.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Pydantic Agents</strong><span>: </span><a href="https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/4c0f384a0626299382c22a8e3372638885e18286/pydantic_ai_slim/pydantic_ai/_agent_graph.py#L779" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">_agent_graph.py#L779</a><span> organizes steps in a graph.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Langchain</strong><span>: </span><a href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/4d1d726e61ed58b39278903262d19bbe9f010772/libs/langchain/langchain/agents/agent_iterator.py#L174" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">agent_iterator.py#L174</a><span> demonstrates the loop structure.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>LangGraph</strong><span>: </span><a href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/24f7d7c4399e2c19b634ed7af0d551ad327e25d7/libs/cli/examples/graphs/agent.py#L56" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">agent.py#L56</a><span> for a graph-based approach.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Now you know the secret -

<p>In a first for space cuisine, ESA project astronaut <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Astronauts/Slawosz_Uznanski-Wisniewski" target="_blank">Sławosz&nbsp;Uznański-Wiśniewski</a> will bring pierogi, the traditional Polish dumplings, to the International Space Station during the upcoming Axiom Mission 4.</p>

<p>Sławosz is bringing a taste of home to space with a special menu created together with a celebrity chef and a family-owned company in Poland. The food selection includes pierogi stuffed with cabbage and mushrooms, tomato soup with noodles, Polish “leczo” stew with buckwheat, and apple crumble for dessert.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we have some significant announcements about the future of the Fauna service as well as our core technology.</p><p>Fauna’s mission has been to make working with operational data productive, scalable and secure for every software development team. Over the years Fauna built a revolutionary new document-relational database that has delighted thousands of development teams across the globe and powered the businesses of hundreds of paying customers.
However, after careful consideration, we have made the hard decision to sunset the Fauna service over the next several months.</p><p>Driving broad based adoption of a new operational database that runs as a service globally is very capital intensive. In the current market environment, our board and investors have determined that it is not possible to raise the capital needed to achieve that goal independently.
While we will no longer be accepting new customers, existing Fauna customers will experience no immediate change. We will gradually transition customers off Fauna and are committed to ensuring a smooth process over the next several months.  For more specifics see the FAQ below.</p><h2><span id="a-commitment-to-open-sourcing-the-fauna-technology"></span>A commitment to open sourcing the Fauna technology</h2><p>With this change we are also committing to releasing an open source version of Fauna’s core database technology alongside our existing open source drivers and CLI tooling. This ensures that Fauna's unique capabilities—our transactional features, document-relational data model, and our database language (FQL)—will be available to the community. We hope this will serve as both a valuable reference for database practitioners and will provide ongoing value to the wider developer community.</p><p>We are profoundly grateful to our customers, partners, and investors who have been integral to the Fauna journey.  We would not have accomplished what we did without your support.  We understand that this is going to be a disruptive change to many and are fully committed to working with our existing customers to help them migrate off the service over the next several months.  While this marks the end of the paid Fauna service the team looks forward to sharing the Fauna technology with the broader community.</p><p>To read more about the migration support and timelines for existing customers please follow the link below.</p><ul><li><a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/eol-faq">FAQs for Fauna customers</a><a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/eol-faq"><span><i></i></span></a></li><li><a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/migrate">Migration guide</a><a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/migrate"><span><i></i></span></a></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

      <article>
        

        





<p>Here in the northern hemisphere the vernal equinox just passed and the days are
quickly getting longer.  One of my colleagues lives in Stavanger, Norway.  Our
team’s semi-weekly standup is at 6:30pm his time, so I’ve been accustomed to
seeing the window in his background be pitch black for the past six months.
But from one meeting to the next, his window went from pitch black to bright.
This led me to think about a basic astronomy question I had never given much
thought to before — just how fast do the days get longer?  When Spring comes
and the days are getting longer, how many extra minutes of sunlight do we get
from one day to the next?  So I built a little interactive graph that shows how
the length of the day changes as a function of latitude, along with how it
changes from one day to the next:</p>





<p>The vertical dashed lines represent the various solstices and equinoxes.  As
expected, for northern latitudes the longest day is on the summer solstice and
the shortest on the winter solstice.  On the equinoxes the day is exactly 12
hours no matter what latitude you are at, and this is also when the length of
the day is changing the fastest — unless you are very close to the Arctic
circle (latitude 66.55°).</p>

<p>One of the more interesting features I hadn’t appreciated before is that when
you get close to the Arctic circle, the length of the days is essentially a
zigzag, straight up from the winter solstice all the way to the summer solstice
and back down again.</p>

<h2 id="the-math-behind-it">The math behind it</h2>

<p>So what calculations are going into producing these curves?</p>

<h3 id="how-long-is-the-sun-up-for">How long is the Sun up for?</h3>

<p>The first thing we need to know is how long the Sun is up for on a particular
day of the year.  Spherical astronomy has a useful quantity that lets us
determine this, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour_angle">hour angle</a>.  The hour angle of an object is the
angle it makes with the meridian (the line across the sky going from north to
south).  Converting the hour angle into a unit of time (like hours) tells us
how long it will be before the object crosses the meridian (“transits” in the
astronomical parlance).  Since we want the time from rising to setting, the
length of daylight will be twice the amount of time it takes between rising and
transit:</p>

\[t_{\textrm{daylight}} = 2H \left( \frac{24 \, \textrm{hr}}{360^{\circ}} \right)
= \frac{2H}{15^{\circ}} \, \textrm{hr}.\]

<p>If we can figure out what the Sun’s hour angle is when it rises, we’ll have the
amount of daylight in a day.  To get this, we need to know two things: the
observer’s latitude, which we’ll call \(\lambda\); and the declination of the
Sun, \(\delta\), which is the angle of the Sun above the celestial equator.</p>

<p>A diagram (from <a href="http://star-www.st-and.ac.uk/~fv/webnotes/chapter7.htm">Prof. Fiona Vincent</a>) helps to illustrate the setup:</p>

<p><img src="https://joe-antognini.github.io/assets/posts/daylight/celestial-sphere.gif"></p>

<p>The position of the object we’re interested in is labeled with \(X\) in this
diagram, and it shows the general case where the object is at some arbitrary
altitude \(a\) above the horizon.  (Note that the latitude is labeled \(\phi\)
in this diagram.)</p>

<p>We know the lengths of all three sides of the triangle and want to find the
angle \(H\).  To do this we can turn to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_law_of_cosines">spherical law of cosines</a>:</p>

\[\cos (90^{\circ} - a) = \cos (90^{\circ} - \lambda) \cos (90^{\circ} - \delta)
+ \sin(90^{\circ} - \lambda) \sin (90^{\circ} - \delta) \cos H.\]

<p>Since we want to know the hour angle of the Sun when it’s rising, we can set
the altitude, \(a\), to 0.  Solving for \(H\), this becomes</p>

\[H = \arccos (-\tan \lambda \tan \delta).\]

<p>This is the so-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_equation">sunrise equation</a>.”</p>

<p>In order to make use of this equation we now need to find the declination of
the Sun.  The Sun just moves along a great circle on the sky called the
“ecliptic,” and to first order this motion is approximately constant.  So we
can model the Sun’s declination over the course of the year with a simple
sinusoid:</p>

\[\delta \simeq \epsilon \sin \left( \frac{T}{365 \, \textrm{d}} \right),\]

<p>where \(\epsilon\) is the tilt of the Earth’s rotation axis (the “obliquity of
the ecliptic” in the astronomical jargon), about \(23.45^{\circ}\), and \(T\)
is just the number of days since the vernal equinox.</p>

<p>Putting this all together, if you have a latitude and day of the year you can
calculate the length of daylight by using this formula:</p>

\[t_{\textrm{daylight}} \approx \frac{2}{15^{\circ}} \arccos \left(-\tan \lambda
\tan \left(23.45^{\circ} \times \sin \frac{2 \pi T}{365 \, \textrm{d}} \right)
\right) \, \textrm{hr}.\]

<h3 id="daylight-across-the-globe">Daylight across the globe</h3>

<p>There are a few interesting cases to consider in this equation.  First, let’s
suppose we are on the equator.  In that case, our latitude is zero, and the
equation just reduces to \(t_{\textrm{daylight}} = 2/15^{\circ} \arccos (0) \,
\textrm{hr} = 12 \, \textrm{hr}\).  <em>On the equator, every day of the year is
exactly 12 hours long.</em></p>

<p>Another case to consider is what happens on the vernal equinox.  Now we set
\(T\) to zero and once again the argument to the arccosine disappears, and we
get 12 hours.  (And because \(\cos (x + \pi) = \cos x\), this also happens on
the autumnal equinox.)  <em>On an equinox, the day is exactly 12 hours long,
independent of latitude.</em></p>

<p>The last thing to consider is that the arccosine function is only defined if
the argument is between \(-1\) and \(1\).  But the argument to the function is
the product of two tangents, and the tangent function is unbounded.  Let’s see
what happens on the summer solstice.  Here the \(\sin T\) term is exactly 1.
If the product \(\tan \lambda \tan 23.45^{\circ}\) exceeds 1, then the
arccosine function will be undefined.  This will happen when the latitude is
above \(90^{\circ} - 23.45^{\circ} = 66.55^{\circ}\).  This latitude defines
the Arctic circle, and at this latitude and above the length of daylight on the
summer solstice is undefined.  This is because at these latitudes the Sun
<em>doesn’t</em> set at this time of the year!  In the extreme limit of the north
pole, \(\tan 90^{\circ} = \infty\) and the length of day is undefined all year
long.  At the north pole, the Sun rises just once per year, on the vernal
equinox, and stays up until the autumnal equinox.</p>

<h2 id="the-derivative-of-daylight">The derivative of daylight</h2>

<p>Now that we have an equation for the length of daylight, seeing how much it
changes from day to day is fairly straightforward.  All we have to do is take
the derivative.  Converting to the more useful units of minutes / day, this
ends up being:</p>

\[\frac{dt_{\textrm{daylight}}}{dT} = \frac{576 \epsilon \cos 2\pi \widetilde{T}
\tan \lambda \sec^2 (\epsilon \sin 2\pi \widetilde{T})}{73\sqrt{1 - \tan^2
\lambda \tan^2 (\epsilon \sin 2\pi \widetilde{T})}} \,
\frac{\textrm{min}}{\textrm{day}},\]

<p>where to make the equation a little cleaner, I’ve used \(\widetilde{T}\) to
represent the fraction of the year since the vernal equinox.</p>

<h2 id="complications">Complications</h2>

<p>To get a relatively simple functional form, I made a few approximations in the
plots and equations above.  What would we have to change if we wanted a more
accurate calculation?</p>

<h3 id="atmospheric-refraction-and-the-solar-limb">Atmospheric refraction and the solar limb</h3>

<p>When calculating the length of day I assumed that the day began when the Sun is
right on the horizon.  But this isn’t quite when sunrise is in reality.  First,
the Sun has a finite width, about half a degree, so when its center is right on
the horizon, half of the disk is above the horizon, and we would still consider
it daytime.  So really we want to know when the <em>top</em> of the Sun reaches the
horizon.</p>

<p>The second complication is that at the moment we observe the Sun to rise, its
true position is still, in fact, beneath the horizon.  But due to the
refraction light by the atmosphere, the light from the Sun curves upward to
make the Sun appear higher on the sky than it really is.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://joe-antognini.github.io/assets/posts/daylight/atmospheric_refraction.png">

  </figure>

<p>To take into account atmospheric refraction, we would not want to calculate the
hour angle of the Sun when its altitude is zero, but when it is <em>slightly less</em>
than zero.  On the horizon, this effect turns out to be about twice as large as
the width of the Sun.</p>

<p>Taking into account both the width of the solar disk (the “solar limb” in the
jargon) and atmospheric refraction, the altitude of the Sun at sunrise or
sunset is on average about \(-50^{\prime}\). (Though the atmospheric refraction
varies quite a bit due to weather conditions very close to the horizon.)
Unfortunately this complicates the sunrise equation quite a bit since the
altitude term no longer drops out of the spherical law of cosines equation and
we get</p>

\[H = \arccos \left(-\tan \lambda \tan \delta - \frac{\sin a}{\cos \lambda \cos
\delta} \right).\]

<p>You can see how much extra daylight this effect gives you at different
latitudes with this plot:</p>





<p>A difference in altitude of \(50^{\prime}\) doesn’t sound like too much, but it
adds a non-negligible amount of daylight to the day.  At the latitude of Los
Angeles (\(34^{\circ}\)) it adds around eight extra minutes of daylight to the
day.  So strictly speaking the “equinox” is a bit of a misnomer — thanks to
the atmosphere the length of the day isn’t quite equal to the length of the
night.  Even at the equator where the effect is weakest there is 6 minutes and
40 seconds of extra daylight on the equinox, so the day is more than 13 minutes
longer than the night!  And at higher latitudes the impact of atmospheric
refraction becomes even more pronounced.  At those latitudes the ecliptic runs
almost parallel to the horizon, so the Sun has to move quite a ways
horizontally to make much progress in the vertical direction.  For my friend in
Stavanger this effect adds nearly 20 minutes to his day during the solstices.
But at least until you get very close to the Arctic circle, the change in the
amount of daylight from one day to the next due to this effect is relatively
small.</p>

<h3 id="eccentricity-and-the-obliquity-of-the-ecliptic">Eccentricity and the obliquity of the ecliptic</h3>

<p>There is a second problem with the equation I used for the length of the day.
When I calculated the declination of the Sun I just modeled it as a simple
sinusoid:</p>

\[\delta \simeq \epsilon \sin \left( \frac{T}{365 \, \textrm{d}} \right).\]

<p>This is a reasonably good approximation, but it has two problems.  The first is
that it doesn’t properly take into account the spherical geometry.  You can
imagine that in the limit that the ecliptic were tilted at \(90^{\circ}\), the
Sun’s declination would simply increase linearly from \(0^{\circ}\) to
\(90^{\circ}\) and then back down again.  Really the correct equation is</p>

\[\delta = \arcsin \left(-\sin \epsilon \sin \left( \frac{T}{365 \, \textrm{d}}
\right) \right).\]

<p>We were effectively using the small angle approximation of \(\sin x \simeq x\),
along with its inverse, \(\arcsin x \simeq x\).  Since \(\epsilon\), the
obliquity of the ecliptic, is (sort of) small, the approximation
is only off from the true value by at most \(1.5^{\circ}\), and this ends up
having a fairly small impact on the change in the amount of daylight from one
day to the next.</p>

<p>The other way that the simple model for the Sun’s declination is wrong is that
it assumes that the Sun moves at a constant angular speed over the course of
the year.  But because the Earth’s orbit is elliptical, when the Earth is at
perihelion (which occurs in early January), the Sun will appear to move
somewhat faster than average and when the Earth is at aphelion (in early July),
the Sun will move slower than average.</p>

<p>To account for the eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit you’d have to turn to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_equation">Kepler equation</a>:</p>

\[2 \pi \widetilde{T} = E - e \sin E,\]

<p>where \(E\) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentric_anomaly">eccentric anomaly</a> and \(e\) is the eccentricity of the
Earth’s orbit.  After solving this transcendental equation you’d then have to
convert the eccentric anomaly into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_anomaly">true anomaly</a>:</p>

\[\nu = \arccos \left( \frac{\cos E - e}{1 - e \cos E} \right).\]

<p>This would then give you the ecliptic longitude of the true Sun rather than
the ecliptic longitude of the <em>mean</em> Sun.</p>

<p>The overall impact of the eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit on the length of
the day is pretty minimal, however.  Over the course of the year the Sun drifts
from west to east with respect to the background stars.  Because of this drift,
the length of the <em>solar</em> day is about four minutes longer than the length of
the <em>sidereal</em> day (a complete \(360^{\circ}\) rotation of the Earth).  This
means that near perihelion, when the Sun is moving faster than average, the day
will be slightly longer than it would otherwise be.  And around aphelion the
day will be slightly shorter.  But even at these times when the effect is
maximal, the change in the length of the day is only on the order of 10
seconds (unless, as always, you’re in the Arctic circle or very close to it).</p>

<p>So those are few ways to find out how long the day is, some simpler and some
more accurate.  If you would like to see the code I used to generate the
figures you can find it at <a href="https://github.com/joe-antognini/joe-antognini.github.io/blob/master/assets/posts/daylight/Sunrise.ipynb">this Jupyter notebook</a>.</p>

  Published: March 19, 2025

<p><a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/fontations/tree/main/skrifa">Skrifa</a>
is written in
Rust,
and created as a replacement for FreeType to make font processing in Chrome
secure for all our users.
Skifra takes advantage of Rust's memory safety,
and lets us iterate faster on font technology improvements in Chrome.
Moving from FreeType to Skrifa allows us to be both agile and fearless when
making changes to our font code. We now spend far less time fixing security bugs,
resulting in faster updates, and better code quality.</p>

<p>This post shares why Chrome has moved away from FreeType,
and some interesting technical details of the improvements this move has enabled.</p>

<h2 id="why_replace_freetype" data-text="Why replace FreeType?" tabindex="-1">Why replace FreeType?</h2>

<p>The web is unique in that it allows users to fetch untrusted resources from a
wide variety of untrusted sources with the expectation that things will just
work, and that they are safe in doing so. This assumption is generally correct,
but keeping that promise to users comes at a cost. For example, to use a web
font safely (a font delivered over the network) Chrome employs several security
mitigations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Font processing is
<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/design/sandbox.md">sandboxed</a>
per the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/rule-of-2.md">rule of
two</a>:
they are untrustworthy and the consuming code is unsafe.</li>
<li>Fonts are passed through the <a href="https://github.com/khaledhosny/ots">OpenType
Sanitizer</a> prior to processing.</li>
<li>All the libraries involved in decompressing and processing fonts are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">fuzz
tested</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chrome ships with FreeType and makes use of it as the primary font processing
library on Android, ChromeOS, and Linux. That means a <strong>lot</strong> of users are
exposed if there is a vulnerability in FreeType.</p>

<p>The FreeType library is used by Chrome to compute metrics and load hinted
outlines from fonts. Overall, use of FreeType has been a huge win for Google. It
does a complex job, and does it well, we rely on it extensively and contribute
back to it. However, it is written in unsafe code and has its origins in a time
when malicious inputs were less likely. Merely keeping up with the stream of
issues found by fuzzing costs Google at least 0.25 full time software
engineers. Worse, we observably don't find everything or find things only after
the code has shipped to users.</p>

<p>This pattern of problems is not unique to FreeType, we observe that other unsafe
libraries admit issues even when we use the best software engineers we can find,
code review every change, and require tests.</p>

<h3 id="why_issues_keep_sneaking_in" data-text="Why issues keep sneaking in" tabindex="-1">Why issues keep sneaking in</h3>

<p>When we evaluated FreeType's security, we observed three main classes of issue
to occur (non-exhaustive):</p>

<h4 id="dependency_issues" data-text="Dependency issues" tabindex="-1">Dependency issues</h4>

<p>Fuzzing has repeatedly identified issues in libraries FreeType depends on, such
as bzip2, libpng, and zlib. As an example, compare <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40055682">freetype_bdf_fuzzer:
Use-of-uninitialized-value in
inflate</a>.</p>

<h4 id="fuzzing_isnt_enough" data-text="Fuzzing isn't enough" tabindex="-1">Fuzzing isn't enough</h4>

<p>Fuzzing–automated testing with a wide range of inputs, including randomized
invalid ones–is meant to find many of the types of issues that get into the
stable release of Chrome. We fuzz FreeType as part of Google's
<a href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz">oss-fuzz</a> project. It does find issues, but
fonts have proven somewhat resistant to fuzzing, for the following reasons.</p>

<p>Font files are complex, comparable to video files as they contain multiple
different types of information. Font files are a container format for multiple
tables, where each table serves a different purpose in processing text and fonts
together to produce a correctly positioned glyph on the screen. In a font file
you will find:</p>

<ul>
<li>Static metadata such as font names and parameters for variable fonts.</li>
<li>Mappings from Unicode characters to glyphs.</li>
<li>A complex ruleset and grammar for screen layout of glyphs.</li>
<li>Visual information: Glyph shapes and image information describing what the
glyphs placed on the screen look like.
<ul>
<li>The visual tables can in turn include TrueType hinting programs, which
are mini programs executed to change the glyph shape.</li>
<li>Char strings in the CFF or CFF2 tables which are imperative curve
drawing and hinting instructions executed in the CFF rendering engine.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>There is complexity in font files equivalent to having its own programming
language and state machine processing, requiring specific virtual machines to
execute them.</p>

<p>Because of the complexity of the format, fuzzing has shortcomings in finding
issues in font files.</p>

<p>Good code coverage or fuzzer progress is difficult to achieve for the following
reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fuzzing TrueType hinting programs, CFF char strings and OpenType layout
using simple bit-flipping/shift/insertion/deletion-style mutators struggles
to reach all combinations of states.</li>
<li>Fuzzing needs to at least produce partially valid structures. Random
mutation rarely does so, making good coverage hard to achieve, particularly
for deeper levels of code.</li>
<li>The current fuzzing efforts in ClusterFuzz and oss-fuzz are not yet using
structure-aware mutation. Use of grammar- or structure-aware mutators might
help avoid production of variants that are rejected early, at the cost of
taking more time to develop, and introducing chances which miss parts of the
search space.</li>
</ul>

<p>Data in multiple tables needs to be in sync for fuzzing to make progress:</p>

<ul>
<li>The usual mutation patterns of fuzzers don't produce partially valid data
so many iterations get rejected and progress becomes slow.</li>
<li>The glyph mapping, the OpenType layout tables and glyph drawing are
connected and depend on each other, forming a combinatorial space whose
corners are hard to reach with fuzzing.</li>
<li>For example, the high-severity <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/40055587">tt_face_get_paint
COLRv1</a> vulnerability took more than
10 months to find.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite our best efforts, font security issues have repeatedly reached end
users. Replacing FreeType with a Rust alternative will prevent multiple entire
classes of vulnerability.</p>

<h2 id="skrifa_in_chrome" data-text="Skrifa in Chrome" tabindex="-1">Skrifa in Chrome</h2>

<p><a href="https://skia.org/">Skia</a> is the graphics library used by Chrome. Skia relies on
FreeType to load metadata and letterforms from fonts.
<a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/fontations/tree/main/skrifa">Skrifa</a> is a Rust
library, part of the <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/fontations">Fontations</a>
family of libraries, that provides a safe replacement for the parts of FreeType
used by Skia.</p>

<p>To transition FreeType to Skia the Chrome team developed a new Skia font backend
based on <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/fontations/tree/main/skrifa">Skrifa</a>
and gradually rolled out the change to users:</p>

<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/6df58d58e667f19490acc1c51095aaf08842bea7">Chrome 128 (August 2024) we enabled
Fontations</a>
for use in less commonly used font formats, such as for color fonts and
CFF2, as a safe trial run.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://chromestatus.com/feature/5717358869217280">Chrome 133 (February 2025) we enabled
Fontations</a> for all web
fonts usage on Linux, Android and ChromeOS, and for web fonts usage as
fallback on Windows and Mac—in cases where the system does not support a
font format but Chrome needs to display it.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the integration into Chrome, we rely on the smooth integration of Rust into
the codebase introduced by the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/01/supporting-use-of-rust-in-chromium.html">Chrome security
team</a>.</p>

<p>In the future we'll switch to Fontations for operating system fonts as well,
starting with Linux and ChromeOS, then on Android.</p>

<h3 id="safety_first_and_foremost" data-text="Safety, first and foremost" tabindex="-1">Safety, first and foremost</h3>

<p>Our primary goal is to reduce (or ideally, eliminate!) security vulnerabilities
that are caused by out of bounds access to memory. Rust provides this out of the
box as long as you avoid any <em>unsafe</em> code blocks.</p>

<p>Our performance goals require us to perform one operation that is currently
unsafe: reinterpretation of arbitrary bytes as a strongly typed data structure.
This allows us to read the data from a font file without performing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-copy">unnecessary
copies</a> and is essential for producing
a fast font parser.</p>

<p>To avoid our own unsafe code, we've chosen to outsource this responsibility to
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/bytemuck">bytemuck</a> which is a Rust library designed
specifically for this purpose and is widely tested and used across the
ecosystem. Concentrating raw data reinterpretation in bytemuck ensures we have
this functionality in one place and audited, and avoid repeating unsafe code for
the purpose. The <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2835-project-safe-transmute.html">safe transmute
project</a> aims
to incorporate this functionality directly into the Rust compiler and we will
make the switch as soon as it is available.</p>

<h3 id="correctness_matters" data-text="Correctness matters" tabindex="-1">Correctness matters</h3>

<p>Skrifa is built out of independent components where most data structures are
designed to be immutable. This improves readability, maintainability and
multithreading. It also makes the code more amenable to unit testing. We've
taken advantage of this opportunity and have produced a suite of roughly 700
unit tests that cover our full stack from low level parsing routines to high
level hinting virtual machines.</p>

<p>Correctness also implies fidelity and FreeType is highly regarded for its
generation of high quality outlines. We must match this quality to be a suitable
replacement. To that end, we have built a bespoke tool called
<a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/fontations/tree/main/fauntlet">fauntlet</a> that
compares the output of Skrifa and FreeType for batches of font files across a
wide range of configurations. This affords us some assurance that we can avoid
regressions in quality.</p>

<p>In addition, before the integration into Chromium, we ran a <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/skia/gm/fontations_ft_compare.cpp">wide set of pixel
comparisons</a>
in Skia, comparing FreeType rendering to Skrifa and Skia rendering to ensure the
pixel differences are absolutely minimal, in all required rendering modes
(across different antialiasing and hinting modes).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">Fuzz testing</a> is an important tool for
determining how a piece of software will react to malformed and malicious
inputs. We've been continuously fuzzing our new code since June of 2024. This
covers the Rust libraries itself and the integration code. While the fuzzer has
found (as of this writing) 39 bugs, it's worth noting that <strong>none of these have
been security critical</strong>. They may cause undesired visual results or even
controlled crashes, but won't lead to exploitable vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2 id="onward" data-text="Onward!" tabindex="-1">Onward!</h2>

<p>We are very pleased with the results of our efforts to use Rust for text.
Delivering safer code to users <em>and</em> gaining developer productivity is a huge
win for us. We plan to continue to seek opportunities to use Rust in our text
stacks. If you'd like to know more,
<a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/oxidize">Oxidize</a> outlines some of Google Fonts
future plans.</p>

The standard view of housing markets holds that the flexibility of local housing supply–shaped by factors like geography and regulation–strongly affects the response of house prices, house quantities and population to rising housing demand. However, from 2000 to 2020, we find that higher income growth predicts the same growth in house prices, housing quantity, and population regardless of a city's estimated housing supply elasticity. We find the same pattern when we expand the sample to 1980 to 2020, use different elasticity measures, and when we instrument for local housing demand. Using a general demand-and-supply framework, we show that our findings imply that constrained housing supply is relatively unimportant in explaining differences in rising house prices among U.S. cities. These results challenge the prevailing view of local housing and labor markets and suggest that easing housing supply constraints may not yield the anticipated improvements in housing affordability.

<p><strong>Pork accounts for more than a third</strong> of the world’s meat, making pigs among the planet’s most widely consumed animals. They are also widely reviled: For about two billion people, eating pork is explicitly prohibited. The Hebrew Bible and the Islamic Koran both forbid adherents from eating pig flesh, and this ban is one of humanity’s most deeply entrenched dietary restrictions. For centuries, scholars have struggled to find a satisfying explanation for this widespread taboo. “There are an amazing number of misconceptions people continue to have about pigs,” says archaeologist Max Price of Durham University, who is among a small group of scholars scouring both modern excavation reports and ancient tablets for clues about the rise and fall of pork consumption in the ancient Near East. “That makes this research both frustrating and fascinating.”</p>



<p>Among the most surprising finds is that the inhabitants of the earliest cities of the Bronze Age (3500–1200 <span>b.c.</span>) were enthusiastic pig eaters, and that even later Iron Age (1200–586 <span>b.c.</span>) residents of Jerusalem enjoyed the occasional pork feast. Yet despite a wealth of data and new techniques including ancient DNA analysis, archaeologists still wrestle with many porcine mysteries, including why the once plentiful animal gradually became scarce long before religious taboos were enacted. Ultimately, the tale of the pig in the ancient Near East reveals how humans thrived in the first cities, the ways in which economic inequality shaped early urban societies, and the important role that diet played in defining ethnic groups and distinguishing friend from foe.</p>

<p><strong>Pigs are prolific</strong>. A single sow can mother up to 100 piglets, far more than sheep, goats, or cows, and their offspring can reach maturity in about six months. They require less than half the amount of water needed by a cow or a horse, making them more drought tolerant. In many parts of the globe, past and present, pigs root through trash, converting noxious garbage into nutritious food. Today, one billion pigs are slaughtered annually to produce a wide array of food products, including pork chops, ham hocks, bacon, and lard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The domestic pig’s story begins with the wild boar, <em>Sus scrofa</em>, which roamed Southeast Asia more than five million years ago and slowly spread across Asia into Europe. Early humans hunted this intelligent, fierce animal across both continents. Some 10,000 years ago in the Near East, and a few millennia later in China, <em>S. scrofa</em> began to transform into <em>S. scrofa domesticus</em>. Precisely how this took place is only now coming into focus.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, at the site of Hallan Çemi in southeastern Anatolia, archaeologists unearthed 51,000 animal bones dating to about 10,000 <span>b.c.</span> Of these, boar bones made up nearly one in five of the recovered remains, suggesting that the animal was an important source of meat. Researchers also found that nearly half the boars were less than a year old when killed, and that most of the rest were under three.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Archaeologist Melinda Zeder of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History argues that settlements such as Hallan Çemi mark the start of the long process of pig domestication, which began around the same time humans started to live in permanent settlements and to transform wild grasses into cultivated grain. “Boars were drawn to places humans inhabited, with their accumulation of trash, as well as to their fields,” Zeder says. The animals’ proximity allowed hunters to pick and choose their prey. “People had a culling strategy that encouraged the growth of herds,” she adds, noting that hunters targeted young male boars and allowed sows to live in order to breed. Pigs’ significance to the people of these early settlements is reflected in the numerous representations of wild boars that have been discovered at the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (ca. 10,000–8200 <span>b.c.</span>) site of Göbeklitepe, also in southeastern Anatolia.</p>



<p>At another site in the region, called Çayönü Tepesi, which began to be settled around 8600 <span>b.c.</span>, archaeologists excavating from the 1960s to the 1990s unearthed a number of boar molars and skulls that came from younger animals and were smaller than those dating to the beginning of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic. Zeder believes that these morphological changes show that the people living at Çayönü Tepesi—and, almost certainly, at other settlements in the area—were beginning to put the wild animal on the path to domestication.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The first site in the Near East</strong> where archaeologists have found unmistakable evidence of pig domestication is Tel Motza, a large Neolithic settlement established around 8600 <span>b.c.</span> in what is now Jerusalem. In 2012, archaeologists uncovered large numbers of bones there dating to just after 7000 <span>b.c.</span> that show clear signs of traits associated with the fully domesticated pig, which is smaller, shorter-faced, and more docile than its wild cousin. Further excavations across the region have shown that <em>S. scrofa domesticus</em> appeared not long after at other Neolithic sites.</p>

<p>The spread of domesticated pigs was slower and more uneven than it was for sheep and goats, which were domesticated at roughly the same time. Pigs appear to have thrived in areas with access to water and forests where they could forage for nuts. These omnivorous animals not only provided copious meat, but also cleaned up food scraps and human waste that might attract pests or spread disease. Caches of deliberately buried bones at Neolithic sites provide evidence that people slaughtered pigs for barbecues that may have encouraged social cohesion as well as serving as a nutritious meal. At the site of Ayn Ghazal in Amman, Jordan, a Neolithic settlement inhabited by some 3,000 people that flourished from around 7200 to 5000 <span>b.c.</span>, archaeologists in the 1980s found pig skulls buried with those belonging to humans, indicating that people perceived the animal as important in ways beyond its utility as a food source.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>With the growth of the world’s</strong> first urban areas, starting in southern Mesopotamia around 3500 <span>b.c.</span>, pigs found their niche. Yet their central role in the development of the earliest cities in what is now southern Iraq has been overlooked and underestimated. “We often imagine Mesopotamian foodways in the Bronze Age as having no pigs, but most meat eaten in the largest cities was pork,” Price says. “Big cities are fantastic places to raise pigs. They have shade, stagnant water, and are protected from predators.” And they have lots of trash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although archaeologists have found large numbers of pig bones at early cities such as Uruk, ruminants—animals including cows with four-chambered stomachs that can digest grass—dominate the written record that evolved in tandem with urban life. Herds of sheep, goats, and cattle were relatively easy for government officials to oversee, says Price. Not so pigs, which can live, breed, and be slaughtered quickly in a backyard lot. The swine didn’t need grazing land, just the day’s leftovers. “Large-scale management of pigs really wasn’t possible,” says Zeder. “The small-scale nature of pig raising became a beacon for the urban poor. It existed as a sub-rosa element of the economy.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thousands of clay tablets uncovered across Mesopotamia show that scribes gave short shrift to an animal that was difficult to tax. And excavations reveal that those living in wealthy households, palaces, and temples came to prefer mutton and beef, likely reflecting pork’s lowly reputation. Ruminants also provided lucrative secondary products including milk and wool, which became economic mainstays for better-off residents of these first cities.</p>



<p>The Hittites, who ruled over Anatolia from around 1600 to 1200 <span>b.c.</span>, are known to have commonly sacrificed pigs in ritual acts. As the Bronze Age progressed, however, swine were gradually excluded from rituals across the region, and pork consumption dropped. By 1600 <span>b.c.</span>, less than one in 20 bones found at sites in the Levant typically come from pigs, and most of those appear to be wild boars that were hunted. At the dawn of the Iron Age, some 500 years later, pig-rearing had virtually ceased. “There’s no sign of a sudden taboo, disease, or environmental change,” says Price. “What is clear is that sheep, goats, and cattle took over.” Price suspects that a host of factors contributed to this gradual decline, including more frequent droughts, loss of nut-bearing forests, and the rise of the wool and milk-product trade. “Pigs lost their status,” Price says, as they were increasingly seen as scavengers with an insatiable appetite for food and sex. The stage was set for a more widespread and all-encompassing taboo.</p>

<p><strong>Most scholars believe that</strong> the Hebrew Bible was written down in Jerusalem between around 600 and 300 <span>b.c.</span> The Book of Leviticus contains a warning that the pig “is impure to you; from their flesh, you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch.” Many historians assume that this prohibition reflects an ancient tradition that stretched back to the Israelites, who, by 1200 <span>b.c.</span>, lived in the highlands of the southern Levant with flocks of sheep and goats and herds of cattle. The absence of swine in the archaeological record of such settlements in this rugged region is no surprise. “In the majority of cases,” Price says, “a mobile, pastoral way of life, especially in the Near East, generally does not include raising pigs.”</p>



<p>Yet to the west, along the Mediterranean coast, archaeologists have found abundant evidence of pork consumption in contemporaneous cities associated with the Philistines, who are thought to have arrived with the Sea Peoples from the Aegean around 1200 <span>b.c.</span> The Philistines built cities in what are now Israel and Gaza, creating a loose confederacy. (See “<a href="https://archaeology.org/issues/july-august-2022/features/levant-philistine-origins/">The Philistine Age</a>.”) They also brought their own pigs. Tel Aviv University archaeologist Meirav Meiri has extracted DNA from ancient pig remains in Greece and Israel and found that varieties of European pigs had swamped the local gene pool by around 900 <span>b.c.</span> and became dominant.</p>



<p>In the Hebrew Bible, the Philistines are the Israelites’ chief nemesis. For archaeologists who consider the contrast in pig consumption between the two groups to be a reliable marker of ethnic identity, the story went that if you dug a site in the region without pig bones, you had found an Israelite settlement. “Or so it was thought,” says archaeologist Lidar Sapir-Hen of Tel Aviv University. Additional finds, along with more accurate dating techniques, now show that the Philistines weren’t voracious pork eaters after all. Pig bones in large Philistine cities rarely account for more than a fifth of the meat that people consumed. In nearby smaller towns and villages, that figure drops to just 1 percent. “After the tenth century <span>b.c.</span>,” Price says, “the Philistines have largely given up pork in urban as well as rural areas.” These settlers came to imitate their neighbors, including the Israelites, and sheep, goats, and cattle became the favored meats on the menu.</p>

<p><strong>At the start of the Iron Age</strong>, the story of the pig in the Near East takes a surprising turn. Archaeologists have detected an uptick in pork consumption in the region around 1000 <span>b.c.</span> This was about the time that the Israelites conquered Jerusalem by defeating a local Canaanite tribe and made it the capital of what became known as Judea. “There’s a creeping increase in pigs at this time, primarily in the northern kingdom of Israel,” says Price. At the urban sites of Megiddo and Tel Hazor, for example, excavators have unearthed butchered pig bones dating to the period between 1000 and 586 <span>b.c.</span>, while at the site of Beth Shean, they have discovered that one in 12 bones belonged to swine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even Judeans, who scholars had assumed avoided pork, weren’t, it seems, immune to the lure of a pig roast. Sapir-Hen was part of an Israel Antiquities Authority team in 2021 that examined a complete pig skeleton dating to about 700 <span>b.c.</span> that had been unearthed in the heart of Jerusalem. The seven-month-old animal died when a building associated with a wealthy family collapsed. Had the young animal survived, it likely would have ended its days at the slaughterhouse—other pig bones that were found nearby have butchery marks. Whether this pig was destined for the plates of lowly servants or those of the well-to-do family isn’t clear. Although only about one in 50 animal bones found from this era in Jerusalem are from pigs, these discoveries show that eating pork wasn’t unheard of among some city dwellers, even those living in prosperous homes in the middle of town. “Every excavation in Jerusalem and Judah from the same period has found some pig bones,” says Sapir-Hen.</p>



<p>Why the prohibition on pork was codified in the Hebrew Bible has long been disputed. Some scholars argue that the taboo was a way to discourage rearing an animal unfit for the harsh terrain and dry climate of the Levantine highlands. Others insist the taboo was a health measure intended to prevent the spread of trichinosis, a parasite that can lurk in undercooked meat and inflicts sufferers with diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. One scholar posits that the domesticated chicken’s arrival from Iran provided an alternative to raising pigs.</p>

<p>Price points out, however, that none of these theories fully accounts for the taboo. Pig-rearing, after all, had existed for thousands of years in the region, even in times of drought, and many types of meat can harbor the larvae that cause trichinosis. Moreover, chickens didn’t become common in Near Eastern farmyards until centuries after the Hebrew Bible was written. For Price, the key piece of evidence is the sole reason given for the taboo in the biblical text—the fact that the pig “has hooves and does not chew its cud.” In other words, it’s unlike ruminants. He argues that this harks back to an era when the Israelites were simple pastoralists. As their descendants settled down in towns and cities, raising pigs became a more viable option. “This detracted from the fantasy of living like their ancestors,” says Price, prompting Judean priests to ban eating pork.</p>



<p>At the time, according to Jordan Rosenblum, a scholar of classical Judaism at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, pigs were just one of many prohibited foods. “The Hebrew Bible equally bans eating the pig, the camel, the hare, and other animals,” he says. Fish without scales, rock badgers, and certain birds were also off-limits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rosenblum argues that the pig taboo only gained special status with the invasion of the Levant by the forces of the Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great in 332 <span>b.c.</span> These European conquerors enjoyed their pork, and pig consumption in the Levant soared. So did tensions between Judeans and their Hellenistic rulers, including the Ptolemaic kings of Egypt and the leaders of the Seleucid Empire based in today’s Iraq.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Archaeologist Yonatan Adler of Ariel University argues that Judaism didn’t emerge as a fully codified religion until at least the second century <span>b.c.</span>, partly in reaction to Hellenistic domination. Rosenblum cites a story from the Second Book of Maccabees, which dates to the second century <span>b.c.</span> in which a group of Judeans forced by Hellenistic officials to eat pork chose martyrdom instead. He says that such tales underscore how the prohibition against eating pork emerged as a symbol of political and religious identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Hellenistic kingdoms collapsed</strong> in the first century <span>b.c.</span>, only to be replaced by the Romans, whose enjoyment of pork repasts was even greater than the Greeks’. Rome’s legendary founders, Romulus and Remus, were sometimes depicted as suckling on a wild sow. Pigs were often ritually sacrificed, and two Roman legions chose a boar as their emblem. When Rome annexed Judea in 63 <span>b.c.</span>, soldiers brought herds of large, fast-growing pig varieties, and the animal once again became a common fixture of the Near Eastern diet—except among Judeans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First-century <span>a.d.</span> Roman writers including Apion and Seneca puzzled over the Jewish prohibition on eating pigs, along with the practice of circumcision and observance of the Sabbath. Their confusion could shade into mockery. “One of the most significant developments in the classical period was the weaponization of pork against the Jews,” says Price. Rosenblum adds that among the emerging class of Jewish teachers known as rabbis, pigs became a symbol of corruption, greed, oppression, and violence, all of which they associated with Rome. Stories about Jews killed by Romans when they refused to eat pork proliferated. “Rome becomes the pig,” says Price.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, archaeological evidence shows that people continued to eat more and more swine in the southern Levant in the first few centuries <span>a.d.</span>, returning to levels not seen since the early Bronze Age. By this time, followers of the nascent Christian religion had rejected Jewish dietary restrictions, in part to attract non-Jewish followers. Pigs remained a staple in the Levant through the first centuries of the Byzantine period. That began to change with the arrival of Islam in the region in the <span>a.d.</span> 630s. Muslims took a middle ground, rejecting most Jewish dietary restrictions but accepting the prohibition on pork. The Koran says the pig is unclean and therefore forbidden, along with blood, dead animals, and animals not dedicated to Allah. This taboo likely did not force a significant change on the faith’s followers: Pre-Islamic sites excavated on the Arabian Peninsula contain few pig bones. This is unsurprising, given the hot and very dry climate and the primarily pastoralist lifestyle on the peninsula.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although pork consumption declined with the rise of Islam, it never stopped completely. Despite climate change, shifting food fashions, and outright religious bans, people in the Middle East have been raising pigs for at least 10,000 years. In today’s Israel, Palestinian Christians continue to enjoy pork barbecues. There is even a Jewish kibbutz where pigs are raised for medical research, and the surplus meat is sold. The animal that Price calls “intelligent, curious, and social” seems destined to remain an inextricable part of the region’s foodways.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="auto">First, to get an overview of all available command line options, you can either run
<a href="#command-line-options"><code>fd -h</code></a> for a concise help message or <code>fd --help</code> for a more detailed

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Simple search</h3><a id="user-content-simple-search" aria-label="Permalink: Simple search" href="#simple-search"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>fd</em> is designed to find entries in your filesystem. The most basic search you can perform is to
run <em>fd</em> with a single argument: the search pattern. For example, assume that you want to find an
old script of yours (the name included <code>netflix</code>):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="> fd netfl
Software/python/imdb-ratings/netflix-details.py"><pre><span>&gt;</span> fd netfl
Software/python/imdb-ratings/netflix-details.py</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If called with just a single argument like this, <em>fd</em> searches the current directory recursively
for any entries that <em>contain</em> the pattern <code>netfl</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Regular expression search</h3><a id="user-content-regular-expression-search" aria-label="Permalink: Regular expression search" href="#regular-expression-search"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The search pattern is treated as a regular expression. Here, we search for entries that start
with <code>x</code> and end with <code>rc</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="> cd /etc
> fd '^x.*rc$'
X11/xinit/xinitrc
X11/xinit/xserverrc"><pre><span>&gt;</span> <span>cd</span> /etc
<span>&gt;</span> fd <span><span>'</span>^x.*rc$<span>'</span></span>
X11/xinit/xinitrc
X11/xinit/xserverrc</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The regular expression syntax used by <code>fd</code> is <a href="https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax" rel="nofollow">documented here</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">If we want to search a specific directory, it can be given as a second argument to <em>fd</em>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="> fd passwd /etc
/etc/default/passwd
/etc/pam.d/passwd
/etc/passwd"><pre><span>&gt;</span> fd passwd /etc

<p dir="auto"><em>fd</em> can be called with no arguments. This is very useful to get a quick overview of all entries
in the current directory, recursively (similar to <code>ls -R</code>):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="> cd fd/tests

testenv
testenv/mod.rs
tests.rs"><pre><span>&gt;</span> <span>cd</span> fd/tests
<span>&gt;</span> fd
testenv
testenv/mod.rs
tests.rs</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you want to use this functionality to list all files in a given directory, you have to use
a catch-all pattern such as <code>.</code> or <code>^</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="> fd . fd/tests/
testenv
testenv/mod.rs
tests.rs"><pre><span>&gt;</span> fd <span>.</span> fd/tests/

<p dir="auto">By default, <em>fd</em> does not search hidden directories and does not show hidden files in the
search results. To disable this behavior, we can use the <code>-H</code> (or <code>--hidden</code>) option:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="> fd pre-commit
> fd -H pre-commit
.git/hooks/pre-commit.sample"><pre><span>&gt;</span> fd pre-commit
<span>&gt;</span> fd -H pre-commit
.git/hooks/pre-commit.sample</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If we work in a directory that is a Git repository (or includes Git repositories), <em>fd</em> does not
search folders (and does not show files) that match one of the <code>.gitignore</code> patterns. To disable
this behavior, we can use the <code>-I</code> (or <code>--no-ignore</code>) option:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="> fd num_cpu
> fd -I num_cpu
target/debug/deps/libnum_cpus-f5ce7ef99006aa05.rlib"><pre><span>&gt;</span> fd num_cpu
<span>&gt;</span> fd -I num_cpu
target/debug/deps/libnum_cpus-f5ce7ef99006aa05.rlib</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To really search <em>all</em> files and directories, simply combine the hidden and ignore features to show
everything (<code>-HI</code>) or use <code>-u</code>/<code>--unrestricted</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Matching the full path</h3><a id="user-content-matching-the-full-path" aria-label="Permalink: Matching the full path" href="#matching-the-full-path"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">By default, <em>fd</em> only matches the filename of each file. However, using the <code>--full-path</code> or <code>-p</code> option,
you can match against the full path.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="> fd -p -g '**/.git/config'

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Command execution</h3><a id="user-content-command-execution" aria-label="Permalink: Command execution" href="#command-execution"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Instead of just showing the search results, you often want to <em>do something</em> with them. <code>fd</code>
provides two ways to execute external commands for each of your search results:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The <code>-x</code>/<code>--exec</code> option runs an external command <em>for each of the search results</em> (in parallel).</li>
<li>The <code>-X</code>/<code>--exec-batch</code> option launches the external command once, with <em>all search results as arguments</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Examples</h4><a id="user-content-examples" aria-label="Permalink: Examples" href="#examples"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Recursively find all zip archives and unpack them:</p>

<p dir="auto">If there are two such files, <code>file1.zip</code> and <code>backup/file2.zip</code>, this would execute
<code>unzip file1.zip</code> and <code>unzip backup/file2.zip</code>. The two <code>unzip</code> processes run in parallel
(if the files are found fast enough).</p>
<p dir="auto">Find all <code>*.h</code> and <code>*.cpp</code> files and auto-format them inplace with <code>clang-format -i</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="fd -e h -e cpp -x clang-format -i"><pre>fd -e h -e cpp -x clang-format -i</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note how the <code>-i</code> option to <code>clang-format</code> can be passed as a separate argument. This is why
we put the <code>-x</code> option last.</p>
<p dir="auto">Find all <code>test_*.py</code> files and open them in your favorite editor:</p>

<p dir="auto">Note that we use capital <code>-X</code> here to open a single <code>vim</code> instance. If there are two such files,
<code>test_basic.py</code> and <code>lib/test_advanced.py</code>, this will run <code>vim test_basic.py lib/test_advanced.py</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To see details like file permissions, owners, file sizes etc., you can tell <code>fd</code> to show them
by running <code>ls</code> for each result:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="fd … -X ls -lhd --color=always"><pre>fd … -X ls -lhd --color=always</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This pattern is so useful that <code>fd</code> provides a shortcut. You can use the <code>-l</code>/<code>--list-details</code>
option to execute <code>ls</code> in this way: <code>fd … -l</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>-X</code> option is also useful when combining <code>fd</code> with <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/">ripgrep</a> (<code>rg</code>) in order to search within a certain class of files, like all C++ source files:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="fd -e cpp -e cxx -e h -e hpp -X rg 'std::cout'"><pre>fd -e cpp -e cxx -e h -e hpp -X rg <span><span>'</span>std::cout<span>'</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Convert all <code>*.jpg</code> files to <code>*.png</code> files:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="fd -e jpg -x convert {} {.}.png"><pre>fd -e jpg -x convert {} {.}.png</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Here, <code>{}</code> is a placeholder for the search result. <code>{.}</code> is the same, without the file extension.
See below for more details on the placeholder syntax.</p>
<p dir="auto">The terminal output of commands run from parallel threads using <code>-x</code> will not be interlaced or garbled,
so <code>fd -x</code> can be used to rudimentarily parallelize a task run over many files.
An example of this is calculating the checksum of each individual file within a directory.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="fd -tf -x md5sum > file_checksums.txt"><pre><code>fd -tf -x md5sum &gt; file_checksums.txt
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Placeholder syntax</h4><a id="user-content-placeholder-syntax" aria-label="Permalink: Placeholder syntax" href="#placeholder-syntax"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>-x</code> and <code>-X</code> options take a <em>command template</em> as a series of arguments (instead of a single string).
If you want to add additional options to <code>fd</code> after the command template, you can terminate it with a <code>\;</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The syntax for generating commands is similar to that of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/" rel="nofollow">GNU Parallel</a>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>{}</code>: A placeholder token that will be replaced with the path of the search result
(<code>documents/images/party.jpg</code>).</li>
<li><code>{.}</code>: Like <code>{}</code>, but without the file extension (<code>documents/images/party</code>).</li>
<li><code>{/}</code>: A placeholder that will be replaced by the basename of the search result (<code>party.jpg</code>).</li>
<li><code>{//}</code>: The parent of the discovered path (<code>documents/images</code>).</li>
<li><code>{/.}</code>: The basename, with the extension removed (<code>party</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If you do not include a placeholder, <em>fd</em> automatically adds a <code>{}</code> at the end.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Parallel vs. serial execution</h4><a id="user-content-parallel-vs-serial-execution" aria-label="Permalink: Parallel vs. serial execution" href="#parallel-vs-serial-execution"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For <code>-x</code>/<code>--exec</code>, you can control the number of parallel jobs by using the <code>-j</code>/<code>--threads</code> option.
Use <code>--threads=1</code> for serial execution.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Excluding specific files or directories</h3><a id="user-content-excluding-specific-files-or-directories" aria-label="Permalink: Excluding specific files or directories" href="#excluding-specific-files-or-directories"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Sometimes we want to ignore search results from a specific subdirectory. For example, we might
want to search all hidden files and directories (<code>-H</code>) but exclude all matches from <code>.git</code>
directories. We can use the <code>-E</code> (or <code>--exclude</code>) option for this. It takes an arbitrary glob
pattern as an argument:</p>

<p dir="auto">We can also use this to skip mounted directories:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="> fd -E /mnt/external-drive …"><pre><span>&gt;</span> fd -E /mnt/external-drive …</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">.. or to skip certain file types:</p>

<p dir="auto">To make exclude-patterns like these permanent, you can create a <code>.fdignore</code> file. They work like
<code>.gitignore</code> files, but are specific to <code>fd</code>. For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="> cat ~/.fdignore
/mnt/external-drive
*.bak"><pre><span>&gt;</span> cat <span>~</span>/.fdignore
/mnt/external-drive
<span>*</span>.bak</pre></div>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto"><code>fd</code> also supports <code>.ignore</code> files that are used by other programs such as <code>rg</code> or <code>ag</code>.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto">If you want <code>fd</code> to ignore these patterns globally, you can put them in <code>fd</code>'s global ignore file.
This is usually located in <code>~/.config/fd/ignore</code> in macOS or Linux, and <code>%APPDATA%\fd\ignore</code> in
Windows.</p>
<p dir="auto">You may wish to include <code>.git/</code> in your <code>fd/ignore</code> file so that <code>.git</code> directories, and their contents
are not included in output if you use the <code>--hidden</code> option.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Deleting files</h3><a id="user-content-deleting-files" aria-label="Permalink: Deleting files" href="#deleting-files"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can use <code>fd</code> to remove all files and directories that are matched by your search pattern.
If you only want to remove files, you can use the <code>--exec-batch</code>/<code>-X</code> option to call <code>rm</code>. For
example, to recursively remove all <code>.DS_Store</code> files, run:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="> fd -H '^\.DS_Store$' -tf -X rm"><pre><span>&gt;</span> fd -H <span><span>'</span>^\.DS_Store$<span>'</span></span> -tf -X rm</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you are unsure, always call <code>fd</code> without <code>-X rm</code> first. Alternatively, use <code>rm</code>s "interactive"
option:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="> fd -H '^\.DS_Store$' -tf -X rm -i"><pre><span>&gt;</span> fd -H <span><span>'</span>^\.DS_Store$<span>'</span></span> -tf -X rm -i</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you also want to remove a certain class of directories, you can use the same technique. You will
have to use <code>rm</code>s <code>--recursive</code>/<code>-r</code> flag to remove directories.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">There are scenarios where using <code>fd … -X rm -r</code> can cause race conditions: if you have a
path like <code>…/foo/bar/foo/…</code> and want to remove all directories named <code>foo</code>, you can end up in a
situation where the outer <code>foo</code> directory is removed first, leading to (harmless) <em>"'foo/bar/foo':
No such file or directory"</em> errors in the <code>rm</code> call.</p>

<p dir="auto">Let's search my home folder for files that end in <code>[0-9].jpg</code>. It contains ~750.000
subdirectories and about a 4 million files. For averaging and statistical analysis, I'm using
<a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine">hyperfine</a>. The following benchmarks are performed
with a "warm"/pre-filled disk-cache (results for a "cold" disk-cache show the same trends).</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's start with <code>find</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Benchmark 1: find ~ -iregex '.*[0-9]\.jpg$'
  Time (mean ± σ):     19.922 s ±  0.109 s

  Range (min … max):   19.765 s … 20.065 s
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><code>find</code> is much faster if it does not need to perform a regular-expression search:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Benchmark 2: find ~ -iname '*[0-9].jpg'
  Time (mean ± σ):     11.226 s ±  0.104 s
  Range (min … max):   11.119 s … 11.466 s"><pre><code>Benchmark 2: find ~ -iname '*[0-9].jpg'
  Time (mean ± σ):     11.226 s ±  0.104 s
  Range (min … max):   11.119 s … 11.466 s
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Now let's try the same for <code>fd</code>. Note that <code>fd</code> performs a regular expression
search by default. The options <code>-u</code>/<code>--unrestricted</code> option is needed here for
a fair comparison. Otherwise <code>fd</code> does not have to traverse hidden folders and
ignored paths (see below):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Benchmark 3: fd -u '[0-9]\.jpg$' ~
  Time (mean ± σ):     854.8 ms ±  10.0 ms

  Time (mean ± σ):     854.8 ms ±  10.0 ms
  Range (min … max):   839.2 ms … 868.9 ms
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">For this particular example, <code>fd</code> is approximately <strong>23 times faster</strong> than <code>find -iregex</code>
and about <strong>13 times faster</strong> than <code>find -iname</code>. By the way, both tools found the exact
same 546 files 😄.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: This is <em>one particular</em> benchmark on <em>one particular</em> machine. While we have
performed a lot of different tests (and found consistent results), things might
be different for you! We encourage everyone to try it out on their own. See
<a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd-benchmarks">this repository</a> for all necessary scripts.</p>
<p dir="auto">Concerning <em>fd</em>'s speed, a lot of credit goes to the <code>regex</code> and <code>ignore</code> crates that are
also used in <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> (check it out!).</p>

<p dir="auto">Remember that <code>fd</code> ignores hidden directories and files by default. It also ignores patterns
from <code>.gitignore</code> files. If you want to make sure to find absolutely every possible file, always
use the options <code>-u</code>/<code>--unrestricted</code> option (or <code>-HI</code> to enable hidden and ignored files):</p>

<p dir="auto">Also remember that by default, <code>fd</code> only searches based on the filename and
doesn't compare the pattern to the full path. If you want to search based on the
full path (similar to the <code>-path</code> option of <code>find</code>) you need to use the <code>--full-path</code>
(or <code>-p</code>) option.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Colorized output</h3><a id="user-content-colorized-output" aria-label="Permalink: Colorized output" href="#colorized-output"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>fd</code> can colorize files by extension, just like <code>ls</code>. In order for this to work, the environment
variable <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/5/dir_colors" rel="nofollow"><code>LS_COLORS</code></a> has to be set. Typically, the value
of this variable is set by the <code>dircolors</code> command which provides a convenient configuration format
to define colors for different file formats.
On most distributions, <code>LS_COLORS</code> should be set already. If you are on Windows or if you are looking
for alternative, more complete (or more colorful) variants, see <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/vivid">here</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized">here</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/trapd00r/LS_COLORS">here</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">A lot of special regex characters (like <code>[]</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>$</code>, ..) are also special characters in your

<p dir="auto">If your pattern starts with a dash, you have to add <code>--</code> to signal the end of command line
options. Otherwise, the pattern will be interpreted as a command-line option. Alternatively,
use a character class with a single hyphen character:</p>

<p dir="auto">You can use <em>fd</em> to generate input for the command-line fuzzy finder <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd --type file'
export FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND=&quot;$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND&quot;"><pre><span>export</span> FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND=<span><span>'</span>fd --type file<span>'</span></span>
<span>export</span> FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND=<span><span>"</span><span>$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND</span><span>"</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then, you can type <code>vim &lt;Ctrl-T&gt;</code> on your terminal to open fzf and search through the fd-results.</p>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, you might like to follow symbolic links and include hidden files (but exclude <code>.git</code> folders):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd --type file --follow --hidden --exclude .git'"><pre><span>export</span> FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND=<span><span>'</span>fd --type file --follow --hidden --exclude .git<span>'</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can even use fd's colored output inside fzf by setting:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND=&quot;fd --type file --color=always&quot;
export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS=&quot;--ansi&quot;"><pre><span>export</span> FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND=<span><span>"</span>fd --type file --color=always<span>"</span></span>
<span>export</span> FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS=<span><span>"</span>--ansi<span>"</span></span></pre></div>

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/davatorium/rofi"><em>rofi</em></a> is a graphical launch menu application that is able to create menus by reading from <em>stdin</em>. Piping <code>fd</code> output into <code>rofi</code>s <code>-dmenu</code> mode creates fuzzy-searchable lists of files and directories.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example</h4><a id="user-content-example" aria-label="Permalink: Example" href="#example"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Create a case-insensitive searchable multi-select list of <em>PDF</em> files under your <code>$HOME</code> directory and open the selection with your configured PDF viewer. To list all file types, drop the <code>-e pdf</code> argument.</p>

<p dir="auto">The emacs package <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/find-file-in-project">find-file-in-project</a> can
use <em>fd</em> to find files.</p>
<p dir="auto">After installing <code>find-file-in-project</code>, add the line <code>(setq ffip-use-rust-fd t)</code> to your
<code>~/.emacs</code> or <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> file.</p>
<p dir="auto">In emacs, run <code>M-x find-file-in-project-by-selected</code> to find matching files. Alternatively, run
<code>M-x find-file-in-project</code> to list all available files in the project.</p>

<p dir="auto">To format the output of <code>fd</code> as a file-tree you can use the <code>tree</code> command with
<code>--fromfile</code>:</p>

<p dir="auto">This can be more useful than running <code>tree</code> by itself because <code>tree</code> does not
ignore any files by default, nor does it support as rich a set of options as
<code>fd</code> does to control what to print:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="❯ fd --extension rs | tree --fromfile
.
├── build.rs
└── src
    ├── app.rs
    └── error.rs"><pre>❯ fd --extension rs <span>|</span> tree --fromfile
<span>.</span>
├── build.rs
└── src
    ├── app.rs
    └── error.rs</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">On bash and similar you can simply create an alias:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="❯ alias as-tree='tree --fromfile'"><pre>❯ <span>alias</span> as-tree=<span><span>'</span>tree --fromfile<span>'</span></span></pre></div>

<p dir="auto">Note that <code>fd</code> has a builtin feature for <a href="#command-execution">command execution</a> with
its <code>-x</code>/<code>--exec</code> and <code>-X</code>/<code>--exec-batch</code> options. If you prefer, you can still use
it in combination with <code>xargs</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="> fd -0 -e rs | xargs -0 wc -l"><pre><span>&gt;</span> fd -0 -e rs <span>|</span> xargs -0 wc -l</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Here, the <code>-0</code> option tells <em>fd</em> to separate search results by the NULL character (instead of
newlines). In the same way, the <code>-0</code> option of <code>xargs</code> tells it to read the input in this way.</p>

<p>Tesla is having a tough year.</p>



<p>Once a world leader in the electric-vehicle market, the company’s sales across the U.S., China, and several European countries fell year on year in February, and its stock price dropped almost 50% from a mid-December peak.</p>


<figure><blockquote><p><span>Tesla needs India more than India needs Tesla.</span></p></blockquote></figure>


<p>The politics of Tesla leader Elon Musk and surging Chinese rivals are both contributing to the sales slump. In Germany, where <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uk-new-car-sales-drop-1-february-industry-data-shows-2025-03-05/">Musk supported</a> the right-wing populist party, Tesla’s sales collapsed 76% last month. In the U.S., following Musk’s support for President Donald Trump, the company saw a 6% decline. In China, where Shenzhen-based <span><mark><a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/byd" aria-label="Click to learn more about BYD.">BYD<span>i</span></a></mark><span><span><a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/byd">BYD</a><svg aria-label="Close" role="button"><use xlink:href="#X"></use></svg></span>BYD Auto is a Chinese carmaker that became the world’s leading EV manufacturer in 2023, competing with Tesla for market share and global attention.<span><a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/byd"><span>READ MORE</span><svg><use xlink:href="#chevron"></use></svg></a></span></span></span> is the biggest-selling EV brand, Tesla’s sales fell 49%.</p>



<p>Tesla, meanwhile, is ramping up its presence in the emerging economies. It is opening its <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/finance/personal-finance/tesla-set-for-india-debut-rents-space-in-mumbai-s-bkc-for-rs-35-lakh-month-125030600127_1.html">maiden stores in India</a> and Saudi Arabia, and setting up an office in South Africa. Entering new markets, however, may not solve Tesla’s woes as it is likely to face tough competition from Chinese carmakers and several <a href="https://energyforgrowth.org/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-african-ev-manufacturing/">homegrown companies</a>, which have dug their heels deep in their countries. Tesla’s steep pricing and limited product options are unlikely to woo buyers in these new markets, according to EV industry experts.</p>



<p>“Tesla needs India more than India needs Tesla,” Ravi Gadepalli, founder of mobility advisory firm Transit Intelligence, told <em>Rest of World. </em>There are several reasons why the world’s third-largest market will be an uphill battle for the company.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Local automobile giant Tata Motors has grabbed over 60% of the Indian market with its popular and economically priced electric cars. China’s BYD and MG Motor also rank among the top five EV sellers in the country. The automakers have rapidly grown in India by <a href="https://restofworld.org/2024/blusmart-india-ev-cab-shortage/">partnering with ride-hailing companies</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Indian automakers, especially Tata, already have a strong foothold in the EV market,” Jayapradeep Vasudevan, chief business officer of Indian electric-motorcycle maker Raptee.HV, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “Moreover, Tata’s diverse EV lineup and future expansion plans across different vehicle segments position them well to handle the competitive pressure from Tesla’s entry.”</p>



<p>While Tesla would have to build its presence from the ground up, Tata already has an established distribution network and customer service capabilities across urban and rural India, which give the company a significant advantage, Vasudevan said.</p>



<p>Musk has been hinting at an India entry <a href="https://qz.com/india/652561/indias-entrepreneurs-are-already-pre-ordering-teslas-model-3-even-though-they-have-no-idea-how-much-itll-cost">since 2016</a>, but that hasn’t materialized as Tesla failed to <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/elon-musks-tesla-hunts-for-land-in-india-manufacturing-plant-maharashtra-leads-report-2682119-2025-02-19">negotiate lower import taxes</a> with the government. This might change soon. Last month, Musk met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington, where they discussed space technology, mobility, and innovation. On March 11, India’s largest telecom companies, Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, <a href="https://restofworld.org/2025/airtel-starlink-india-deal-modi-musk/">announced partnerships</a> with Musk’s satellite company Starlink, which has so far struggled to get a license to operate in the country. Tesla did not reply to a request for comment for this story.</p>


<figure><blockquote><p><span>By comparison, Tesla products look rather staid and stale to Chinese and Asian consumers, who have a penchant for new things.</span></p></blockquote></figure>


<p>Chinese makers have been quick to innovate, with BYD this week unveiling a lineup of vehicles it says can charge&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-byd-unveils-faster-charging-ev-platform-aims-build-over-4000-charging-2025-03-17/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost as fast</a>&nbsp;as it takes to refuel a regular car. Chinese brands’ success in emerging markets is largely due to their pricing strategy and the variety of models they offer. Tesla is yet to match up to that, John Jörn Stech, an international automotive expert and principal consultant at New York-based Shiftgate Consulting, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>“Chinese rivals are rolling out new models continuously and making updates to their products,” Stech said. “By comparison, Tesla products look rather staid and stale to Chinese and Asian consumers, who have a penchant for new things.”</p>



<p>Tesla is available in several Southeast Asian markets but lags behind Chinese players in most. For instance, in Thailand, the region’s largest EV market, the <a href="https://carnewschina.com/2025/01/23/byd-crowned-thailands-2024-ev-sales-and-surpassed-toyota-in-singapore/">top five EV brands in 2024</a> were all Chinese, with BYD leading the pack by a wide margin. Tesla came in sixth with just 4,121 cars sold in 2024, compared to more than 27,000 from BYD.</p>

It can’t do that unless it has another Tesla Model 3 moment where a single model takes over the world, which is harder now as the Chinese have elevated themselves.” — <strong>Lei Xing, <em>independent auto analyst.</em></strong></dd></p></div><div><p><dt><h3><dfn>Southeast Asia </dfn></h3></dt><dd>“Chinese brands have expanded their production to the region. Tesla has come a long way in going downmarket, but cutting EV costs is challenging. Only BYD has figured out how to make affordable EVs that appeal to global customers.” <strong>— Martin Schröder, <em>associate professor, College of Policy Science, Ritsumeikan University.</em></strong></dd></p></div><div><p><dt><h3><dfn>India</dfn></h3></dt><dd>“Local manufacturers like Tata Motors have invested in infrastructure and gained valuable consumer insights, giving them an advantage. As Tesla establishes itself, its future moves — like starting local production or launching a budget-friendly model — will determine how deeply it can penetrate.” <strong>— Vivek Kumar, <em>project manager, automotive, at U.K.-based data analysis firm GlobalData.</em></strong></dd></p></div><div><p><dt><h3><dfn>China</dfn></h3></dt><dd>“Five years ago, Tesla was the ‘catfish in the pool of sardines.’ Now it has become one of the sardines as the Huaweis and Xiaomis have become the catfishes. What can it do to become a catfish again? Not much given the much more competitive landscape.” <strong>— Lei Xing, <em>independent auto analyst.</em></strong></dd></p></div></div></dl>



<p>There is limited EV sales data available in other Southeast Asian countries, but Tesla ranks second in Malaysia and Singapore in terms of EV sales, and third in Cambodia, according to Martin Schröder, associate professor at the College of Policy Science at Ritsumeikan University.</p>



<p>“Tesla has been under pressure in Asia as competition from Chinese rivals has picked up dramatically over the past two years,” Stech said. “Given the nearly 50% drop in deliveries in China, plummeting sales in Europe, and a likely drop in sales in the U.S., it is unlikely Tesla will look for expansion markets. They have to fix the markets where they already made significant investments.”</p>



<p>In Saudi Arabia, Tesla is <a href="https://www.agbi.com/transport/2025/01/exclusive-tesla-to-enter-saudi-arabia-within-months/">planning to open</a> its first “pop-up stores” and at least one showroom soon. Reports in <a href="https://www.sagoodnews.co.za/here-comes-tesla-south-africa/">South African media</a> in January said Tesla is close to setting up an office in the country.</p>



<p>But this might be too little, too late. Saudi Arabia, for instance, is backing other EV companies, which might give them an edge.</p>



<p>Until 2019, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, held <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/saudi-arabia-fund-dumped-nearly-all-of-its-tesla-shares-in-the-fourth-quarter-filing-shows.html#:~:text=Watchlist-,Saudi%20Arabia%20fund%20dumped%20nearly%20all%20of%20its%20Tesla%20shares,fourth%20quarter%20before%20the%20rally&amp;text=The%20Saudi%20Arabia%20Public%20Investment,selling%2099.5%25%20of%20its%20holding.">more than 8.2 million shares</a> in Tesla. It sold most of the shares in 2019, and has since <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/lucid-signs-deal-raise-1-bln-saudis-pif-affiliate-2024-03-25/">backed American EV maker Lucid Motors</a> as well as Ceer, an automobile manufacturer formed under a joint venture between the sovereign fund and China’s Foxconn. Last year, <a href="https://www.pif.gov.sa/en/news-and-insights/newswire/2023/lucid-group-makes-history-in-saudi-arabia-as-it-opens-country-first-ever-car-manufacturing-facility/">Lucid officially opened</a> the first car-manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>One market where Tesla has found success is the United Arab Emirates, where the company <a href="https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/findus/list/superchargers/United+Arab+Emirates">has set up</a> supercharger networks across major cities. The country has embraced the luxury positioning of Tesla’s cars, and the company, along with other EV players, has benefited from <a href="https://www.rta.ae/wps/portal/rta/ae/home/news-and-media/all-news/NewsDetails/dubai-licensed-electric-vehicles-get-exemption-from-parking-fees">government incentives</a> like free public charging, preferential parking, and exemptions on registration fees.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>T</span>here was no explanation, no warning. One minute, I was in an immigration office talking to an officer about my work visa, which had been approved months before and allowed me, a Canadian, to work in the US. The next, I was told to put my hands against the wall, and patted down like a criminal before being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/18/canadian-actor-jasmine-mooney-detained-mexico-border" data-link-name="in body link">sent to an Ice detention center</a> without the chance to talk to a lawyer.</p><p>I grew up in Whitehorse, Yukon, a small town in the northernmost part of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Canada</a>. I always knew I wanted to do something bigger with my life. I left home early and moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where I built a career spanning multiple industries – acting in film and television, owning bars and restaurants, flipping condos and managing Airbnbs.</p><p>In my 30s, I found my true passion working in the health and wellness industry. I was given the opportunity to help launch an American brand of health tonics called Holy! Water – a job that would involve moving to the US.</p><p>I was granted my trade Nafta work visa, which allows Canadian and Mexican citizens to work in the US in specific professional occupations, on my second attempt. It goes without saying, then, that I have no criminal record. I also love the US and consider myself to be a kind, hard-working person.</p><p>I started working in California and travelled back and forth between Canada and the US multiple times without any complications – until one day, upon returning to the US, a border officer questioned me about my initial visa denial and subsequent visa approval. He asked why I had gone to the San Diego border the second time to apply. I explained that that was where my lawyer’s offices were, and that he had wanted to accompany me to ensure there were no issues.</p><p>After a long interrogation, the officer told me it seemed “shady” and that my visa hadn’t been properly processed. He claimed I also couldn’t work for a company in the US that made use of hemp – one of the beverage ingredients. He revoked my visa, and told me I could still work for the company from Canada, but if I wanted to return to the US, I would need to reapply.</p><p>I was devastated; I had just started building a life in California. I stayed in Canada for the next few months, and was eventually offered a similar position with a different health and wellness brand.</p><p>I restarted the visa process and returned to the same immigration office at the San Diego border, since they had processed my visa before and I was familiar with it. Hours passed, with many confused opinions about my case. The officer I spoke to was kind but told me that, due to my previous issues, I needed to apply for my visa through the consulate. I told her I hadn’t been aware I needed to apply that way, but had no problem doing it.</p><p>Then she said something strange: “You didn’t do anything wrong. You are not in trouble, you are not a criminal.”</p><p>I remember thinking: <em>Why would she say that? Of course I’m not a criminal!</em></p><p>She then told me they had to send me back to Canada. That didn’t concern me; I assumed I would simply book a flight home. But as I sat searching for flights, a man approached me.</p><p>“Come with me,” he said.</p><p>There was no explanation, no warning. He led me to a room, took my belongings from my hands and ordered me to put my hands against the wall. A woman immediately began patting me down. The commands came rapid-fire, one after another, too fast to process.</p><p>They took my shoes and pulled out my shoelaces.</p><p>“What are you doing? What is happening?” I asked.</p><p>“You are being detained.”</p><p>“I don’t understand. What does that mean? For how long?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>That would be the response to nearly every question I would ask over the next two weeks: “I don’t know.”</p><p>They brought me downstairs for a series of interviews and medical questions, searched my bags and told me I had to get rid of half my belongings because I couldn’t take everything with me.</p><p>“Take everything with me where?” I asked.</p><p>A woman asked me for the name of someone they could contact on my behalf. In moments like this, you realize you don’t actually know anyone’s phone number anymore. By some miracle, I had recently memorized my best friend Britt’s number because I had been putting my grocery points on her account.</p><p>I gave them her phone number.</p><hr><p>They handed me a mat and a folded-up sheet of aluminum foil.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>“Your blanket.”</p><p>“I don’t understand.”</p><p>I was taken to a tiny, freezing cement cell with bright fluorescent lights and a toilet. There were five other women lying on their mats with the aluminum sheets wrapped over them, looking like dead bodies. The guard locked the door behind me.</p><figure id="ae72262c-0271-4803-9d59-3a0507b39d41" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Man on one side of cyclone gate watches people sleeping on cement floor under bright lights." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="266.9768951194185" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A border patrol agent watches as girls from Central America sleep under thermal blankets at a detention facility in McAllen, Texas, on 8 September 2014.</span> Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>For two days, we remained in that cell, only leaving briefly for food.

I begged for information.</p><p>“How long will I be here?”</p><p>“I don’t know your case,” the man said. “Could be days. Could be weeks. But I’m telling you right now – you need to mentally prepare yourself for months.”</p><p>Months.</p><p>I felt like I was going to throw up.</p><p>I was taken to the nurse’s office for a medical check. She asked what had happened to me. She had never seen a Canadian there before.

Through this, I think you are going to find a way to help others.”</p><p>At the time, I didn’t know what that meant. She asked if she could pray for me.

I was put in a tiny cell alone with a bunk bed and a toilet.</p><p>The best part: there were blankets. After three days without one, I wrapped myself in mine and finally felt some comfort.</p><p>For the first day, I didn’t leave my cell. I continued fasting, terrified that the food might make me sick.

No matter how hard this was, I had to be grateful. Because every woman I met was in an even more difficult position than mine.</p><p>There were around 140 of us in our unit. Many women had lived and worked in the US legally for years but had overstayed their visas – often after reapplying and being denied. They had all been detained without warning.</p><p>If someone is a criminal, I agree they should be taken off the streets. But not one of these women had a criminal record. These women acknowledged that they shouldn’t have overstayed and took responsibility for their actions. But their frustration wasn’t about being held accountable; it was about the endless, bureaucratic limbo they had been trapped in.</p><p>The real issue was how long it took to get out of the system, with no clear answers, no timeline and no way to move forward. Once deported, many have no choice but to abandon everything they own because the cost of shipping their belongings back is too high.</p><p>I met a woman who had been on a road trip with her husband. She said they had 10-year work visas. While driving near the San Diego border, they mistakenly got into a lane leading to Mexico. They stopped and told the agent they didn’t have their passports on them, expecting to be redirected. Instead, they were detained. They are both pastors.</p><p>I met a family of three who had been living in the US for 11 years with work authorizations. They paid taxes and were waiting for their green cards. Every year, the mother had to undergo a background check, but this time, she was told to bring her whole family. When they arrived, they were taken into custody and told their status would now be processed from within the detention center.</p><p>Another woman from Canada had been living in the US with her husband who was detained after a traffic stop. She admitted she had overstayed her visa and accepted that she would be deported. But she had been stuck in the system for almost six weeks because she hadn’t had her passport. Who runs casual errands with their passport?</p><p>One woman had a 10-year visa. When it expired, she moved back to her home country, Venezuela. She admitted she had overstayed by one month before leaving. Later, she returned for a vacation and entered the US without issue. But when she took a domestic flight from Miami to Los Angeles, she was picked up by Ice and detained. She couldn’t be deported because Venezuela wasn’t accepting deportees. She didn’t know when she was getting out.</p><p>There was a girl from India who had overstayed her student visa for three days before heading back home. She then came back to the US on a new, valid visa to finish her master’s degree and was handed over to Ice due to the three days she had overstayed on her previous visa.</p><p>There were women who had been picked up off the street, from outside their workplaces, from their homes. All of these women told me that they had been detained for time spans ranging from a few weeks to 10 months. One woman’s daughter was outside the detention center protesting for her release.</p><p>That night, the pastor invited me to a service she was holding. A girl who spoke English translated for me as the women took turns sharing their prayers – prayers for their sick parents, for the children they hadn’t seen in weeks, for the loved ones they had been torn away from.</p><p>Then, unexpectedly, they asked if they could pray for me. I was new here, and they wanted to welcome me. They formed a circle around me, took my hands and prayed. I had never felt so much love, energy and compassion from a group of strangers in my life. Everyone was crying.</p><hr><p>At 3am the next day, I was woken up in my cell.</p><p>“Pack your bag. You’re leaving.”</p><p>I jolted upright. “I get to go home?”</p><p>The officer shrugged. “I don’t know where you’re going.”</p><p>Of course. No one ever knew anything.</p><p>I grabbed my things and went downstairs, where 10 other women stood in silence, tears streaming down their faces. But these weren’t happy tears. That was the moment I learned the term “transferred”.</p><p>For many of these women, detention centers had become a twisted version of home. They had formed bonds, established routines and found slivers of comfort in the friendships they had built. Now, without warning, they were being torn apart and sent somewhere new. Watching them say goodbye, clinging to each other, was gut-wrenching.</p><p>I had no idea what was waiting for me next. In hindsight, that was probably for the best.</p><p>Our next stop was Arizona, the San Luis Regional Detention Center. The transfer process lasted 24 hours, a sleepless, grueling ordeal. This time, men were transported with us. Roughly 50 of us were crammed into a prison bus for the next five hours, packed together – women in the front, men in the back. We were bound in chains that wrapped tightly around our waists, with our cuffed hands secured to our bodies and shackles restraining our feet, forcing every movement into a slow, clinking struggle.</p><p>When we arrived at our next destination, we were forced to go through the entire intake process all over again, with medical exams, fingerprinting – and pregnancy tests; they lined us up in a filthy cell, squatting over a communal toilet, holding Dixie cups of urine while the nurse dropped pregnancy tests in each of our cups. It was disgusting.</p><p>We sat in freezing-cold jail cells for hours, waiting for everyone to be processed. Across the room, one of the women suddenly spotted her husband. They had both been detained and were now seeing each other for the first time in weeks.</p><p>The look on her face – pure love, relief and longing – was something I’ll never forget.</p><p>We were beyond exhausted. I felt like I was hallucinating.</p><p>The guard tossed us each a blanket: “Find a bed.”</p><p>There were no pillows. The room was ice cold, and one blanket wasn’t enough. Around me, women lay curled into themselves, heads covered, looking like a room full of corpses. This place made the last jail feel like the Four Seasons.</p><p>I kept telling myself: <em>Do not let this break you.</em></p><p>Thirty of us shared one room. We were given one Styrofoam cup for water and one plastic spoon that we had to reuse for every meal. I eventually had to start trying to eat and, sure enough, I got sick. None of the uniforms fit, and everyone had men’s shoes on. The towels they gave us to shower were hand towels. They wouldn’t give us more blankets. The fluorescent lights shined on us 24/7.</p><p>Everything felt like it was meant to break you. Nothing was explained to us. I wasn’t given a phone call. We were locked in a room, no daylight, with no idea when we would get out.</p><p>I tried to stay calm as every fiber of my being raged towards panic mode. I didn’t know how I would tell Britt where I was. Then, as if sent from God, one of the women showed me a tablet attached to the wall where I could send emails. I only remembered my CEO’s email from memory. I typed out a message, praying he would see it.</p><p>He responded.</p><p>Through him, I was able to connect with Britt. She told me that they were working around the clock trying to get me out. But no one had any answers; the system made it next to impossible. I told her about the conditions in this new place, and that was when we decided to go to the media.</p><p>She started working with a reporter and asked whether I would be able to call her so she could loop him in. The international phone account that Britt had previously tried to set up for me wasn’t working, so one of the other women offered to let me use her phone account to make the call.</p><p>We were all in this together.</p><hr><p>With nothing to do in my cell but talk, I made new friends – women who had risked everything for the chance at a better life for themselves and their families.</p><p>Through them, I learned the harsh reality of seeking asylum. Showing me their physical scars, they explained how they had paid smugglers anywhere from $20,000 to $60,000 to reach the US border, enduring brutal jungles and horrendous conditions.</p><p>One woman had been offered asylum in Mexico within two weeks but had been encouraged to keep going to the US. Now, she was stuck, living in a nightmare, separated from her young children for months. She sobbed, telling me how she felt like the worst mother in the world.</p><p>Many of these women were highly educated and spoke multiple languages. Yet, they had been advised to pretend they didn’t speak English because it would supposedly increase their chances of asylum.</p><p>Some believed they were being used as examples, as warnings to others not to try to come.</p><p>Women were starting to panic in this new facility, and knowing I was most likely the first person to get out, they wrote letters and messages for me to send to their families.</p><figure id="9e05df49-17ae-4d11-9ff1-be9db93309b1" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id=""><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Two handwritten sheets of lined paper" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="332.66990291262135" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Some of the letters given to Jasmine Mooney from the women she met during her time in Ice detention facilities.</span> Photograph: Jasmine Mooney</figcaption></figure><p>It felt like we had all been kidnapped, thrown into some sort of sick psychological experiment meant to strip us of every ounce of strength and dignity.</p><p>We were from different countries, spoke different languages and practiced different religions. Yet, in this place, none of that mattered. Everyone took care of each other. Everyone shared food. Everyone held each other when someone broke down. Everyone fought to keep each other’s hope alive.</p><p>I got a message from Britt. My story had started to blow up in the media.</p><p>Almost immediately after, I was told I was being released.</p><p>My Ice agent, who had never spoken to me, told my lawyer I could have left sooner if I had signed a withdrawal form, and that they hadn’t known I would pay for my own flight home.</p><p>From the moment I arrived, I begged every officer I saw to let me pay for my own ticket home. Not a single one of them ever spoke to me about my case.</p><p>To put things into perspective: I had a Canadian passport, lawyers, resources, media attention, friends, family and even politicians advocating for me. Yet, I was still detained for nearly two weeks.</p><p>Imagine what this system is like for every other person in there.</p><p>A small group of us were transferred back to San Diego at 2am – one last road trip, once again shackled in chains. I was then taken to the airport, where two officers were waiting for me. The media was there, so the officers snuck me in through a side door, trying to avoid anyone seeing me in restraints. I was beyond grateful that, at the very least, I didn’t have to walk through the airport in chains.</p><p>To my surprise, the officers escorting me were incredibly kind, and even funny. It was the first time I had laughed in weeks.</p><p>I asked if I could put my shoelaces back on.</p><p>“Yes,” one of them said with a grin. “But you better not run.”</p><p>“Yeah,” the other added. “Or we’ll have to tackle you in the airport. That’ll really make the headlines.”</p><p>I laughed, then told them I had spent a lot of time observing the guards during my detention and I couldn’t believe how often I saw humans treating other humans with such disregard. “But don’t worry,” I joked. “You two get five stars.”</p><p>When I finally landed in Canada, my mom and two best friends were waiting for me. So was the media. I spoke to them briefly, numb and delusional from exhaustion.</p><p>It was surreal listening to my friends recount everything they had done to get me out: working with lawyers, reaching out to the media, making endless calls to detention centers, desperately trying to get through to Ice or anyone who could help. They said the entire system felt rigged, designed to make it nearly impossible for anyone to get out.</p><p>The reality became clear: Ice detention isn’t just a bureaucratic nightmare. It’s a business. These facilities are privately owned and run for profit.</p><p>Companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group receive <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/06/private-prison-industry-shifts-focus-to-immigrant-detention-centers-funding-immigration-hawks/" data-link-name="in body link">government funding</a> based on the number of people they detain, which is why they <a href="https://theappeal.org/geo-group-earnings-mass-deportations/" data-link-name="in body link">lobby</a> for stricter immigration policies.

Faith that no matter how flawed the system, how cruel the circumstances, humanity will always shine through.</p><p>Even in the darkest places, within the most broken systems, humanity persists. Sometimes, it reveals itself in the smallest, most unexpected acts of kindness: a shared meal, a whispered prayer, a hand reaching out in the dark. We are defined by the love we extend, the courage we summon and the truths we are willing to tell.</p></div></div>]]></description>
