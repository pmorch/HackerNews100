<dt><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/business/media/amazon-melania-trump-film-critics.html?unlocked_article_code=1.IFA.R85v.5ZtNe8FttfaD">Amazon’s Spending on ‘Melania’ Is a Barely Concealed Bribe</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Nicole Sperling and Brooks Barnes, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon paid Ms. Trump’s production company $40 million for the
rights to “Melania,” about $26 million more than the next closest
bidder, Disney. The fee includes a related docuseries that is
scheduled to air later this year. The budget for “Melania” is
unknown, but documentaries that follow a subject for a limited
amount of time usually cost less than $5 million to produce. The
$35 million for marketing is 10 times what some other high-profile
documentaries have received.</p>

<p>All of which has a lot of Hollywood questioning whether Amazon’s
push is anything more than the company’s attempt to ingratiate
itself with President Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a good story, with multiple industry sources with experience making political documentaries, but the Times’s own subhead downplays Amazon’s spending on the film: “The tech giant is spending $35 million to promote its film about the first lady, far more than is typical for documentaries.” They’re spending $35 million now, to promote it, but they already paid $40 million for the rights to the film, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/melania-trump-documentary-speculation_n_6978f160e4b051911224d57f">$28 million of which is believed to have gone to Melania Trump herself</a>. A $35 million total spend would be a lot compared to other high-profile documentaries, but it’s a $75 million total spend. This is not just a little fishy — it’s a veritable open air seafood market.</p>

<p>Back to the Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To grasp just how uncustomary Amazon’s marketing push for
“Melania” is, consider how Magnolia Pictures handled “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/movies/rbg-review-documentary.html">RBG</a>,”
a portrait of Ruth Bader Ginsburg during her 25th year as a
Supreme Court justice, in 2018.</p>

<p>CNN Films produced “RBG” for around $1 million. The promotional
budget, including an awards campaign that helped it land two Oscar
nominations, totaled about $3 million. The film debuted in 34
theaters and expanded into 432 locations over several weeks. It
ultimately collected $14 million, enough to rank as the year’s No.
1 political documentary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Friday, “Melania” will also be released in 1,600 theaters
overseas, where FilmNation, a New York company, is handling
distribution in more than 20 countries. International ticket sales
are expected to be weak, according to box office analysts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shocker.</p>

<p><em><em>This article is co-reported with </em><a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/" target="_blank"><em>THE CITY</em></a><em>, a non-profit newsroom that serves the people of New York. Sign up for its newsletter, </em><a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/the-scoop/" target="_blank"><em>The Scoop</em></a><em>.</em></em></p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2026/01/28/mamdani-billion-budget-gap-eric-adams/" target="_blank">a press conference this week</a> on New York City’s $12 billion budget gap, Mayor Zohran Mamdani zeroed in on the previous administration’s artificial intelligence chatbot as one of “a number of different things we’re going to pursue for savings.”</p>



<p>The chatbot, which was released by the Eric Adams administration in fall of 2023, was meant to provide business owners with an accessible way to check city rules and regulations. But as first documented by The Markup and THE CITY, the bot provided answers that, if followed, would lead to illegal behavior by businesses, like taking a cut of employees’ tips.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for the mayor, Dora Pekec, confirmed in a text message that the new administration plans to take down the chatbot. She said a member of the Mamdani transition team had seen reporting on the bot from <a href="https://themarkup.org/news/2024/03/29/nycs-ai-chatbot-tells-businesses-to-break-the-law">The Markup</a> and <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/04/02/malfunctioning-nyc-ai-chatbot-still-active-false-information/" target="_blank">THE CITY</a> and presented it to the mayor as a possible place to save funds.&nbsp;</p>





<p>At the press conference, <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2026/01/28/mamdani-billion-budget-gap-eric-adams/" target="_blank">Mamdani blamed Adams</a> for the budget shortfall, saying he had been handed “a poisoned chalice.” To close the deficit, he said he would raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations and look “under the hood” of the city’s budget for potential savings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When pressed by reporters on what he might cut, he singled out the chatbot.</p>



<p>“The previous administration had an AI chatbot that was functionally unusable,” Mamdani said. “It was costing the administration around half a million dollars. That, in and of itself, is not something that can bridge this kind of a gap, but it’s an indication of the ways in which money has been spent while refusing to account for the actual costs of what these programs are.”</p>



<p>The bot, built using Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, was part of an ambitious overhaul of digital services in New York called MyCity. The project was meant to streamline access to government but was criticized for relying <a href="https://www.gothamgazette.com/city/11961-mayor-adams-mycity-contracts-services" target="_blank">on outside contractors</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It wasn’t clear how much it cost to maintain the chatbot. Just building the bot’s foundations <a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/ai-artificial-intelligence-eric-adams-nyc/13922640/" target="_blank">reportedly cost nearly $600,000</a>, close to the figure Mamdani provided. Pekec said they didn’t yet have a date for taking down the bot.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Testing by The Markup and THE CITY in 2024 showed that, despite promises from the Adams administration, the chatbot would confidently provide incorrect and potentially harmful information to visitors, even on high-stakes topics.</p>



<p>When asked about housing policy, for example, the bot suggested landlords could discriminate against tenants with Section 8 vouchers. Despite being an intended resource for business owners, the bot didn’t know the minimum wage, and told users it was fine to refuse to accept cash for payment despite a city law to the contrary, enacted in 2020.</p>



<p>After The Markup and THE CITY’s initial report was published, readers continued peppering the bot with sometimes farcical questions, which it continued failing to answer properly. The Adams administration <a href="https://themarkup.org/news/2024/04/02/malfunctioning-nyc-ai-chatbot-still-active-despite-widespread-evidence-its-encouraging-illegal-behavior">defended the bot</a>, saying it would improve over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re identifying what the problems are, we’re gonna fix them, and we’re going to have the best chatbot system on the globe,” Adams said at a press conference. “People are going to come and watch what we’re doing in New York City.”</p>



<p>City administrators soon added disclaimers to the bot advising users to “not use its responses as legal or professional advice.” They also improved some of the bot’s answers, but also appeared to limit the kinds of questions the tool was willing to answer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, the bot advises visitors to “ask an NYC government question only” and cautions that “responses may occasionally produce inaccurate or incomplete content.” Visitors must agree to accept the bot’s limitations before using it.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            </p>

            <p>Look, we all knew it was coming, but now it's official. Microsoft just handed middle managers the ultimate weapon. Their new update for Microsoft 365 allows companies to track exactly where you are, and the days of pretending to be at your desk are over.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>The Death of the "Tech Bro" Excuse</h2>
            <p>Remember when you could text Dave from the office to turn your PC on because you were stuck in traffic? Yeah, those days are dead. Dead and buried.</p>
            
            <p>Microsoft confirmed that starting <strong>March 2026</strong> (delayed from January), managers will be able to see your real-time location. And no, disconnecting from the office Wi-Fi won't save you.</p>

            <p>This "feature" is hitting everything:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Teams on Windows</li>
                <li>Teams on Mac</li>
                <li>And obviously, the mobile app (your pocket spy).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Here is the scary part</h2>
            <p>It’s not just about being <em>at</em> the office. It’s about <em>where</em> you are when you aren't. </p>
            
            <p>If you connect to a Wi-Fi network that isn't your company's, Teams will simply display the name of that network. So if you decide to take a "working lunch" and connect to <strong>"Starbucks_Guest_WiFi"</strong>, your boss sees it instantly. You can’t hide behind a generic "Remote" status anymore.</p>

            <p><strong>Microsoft's Defense:</strong> They claim they added "safety barriers." They say the feature is optional and tracking stops after working hours. History deletes itself. Sure. But let's be real—if your boss makes it a mandatory policy, what choice do you actually have?
            </p>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>They call it "coordination." I call it creepy. It feels a lot like a digital ankle monitor. For hybrid workers or anyone who values a shred of privacy, Microsoft 365 just became a lot more invasive.</p>

We then took a creative turn, developing a softer, low-contrast design with a distinctly hand-crafted feel. </p><p>Each letterform was carefully shaped to feel expressive yet balanced, with serifs that resemble loaves of bread – a nod to Aardman’s tactile, playful world.</p></div></div><div data-layout="halves" id="outcomes"><p><h2>Outcomes</h2></p><div><p>The finished typeface – <em>Buttered Crumpet</em> – gives Aardman a timeless, familiar tone of voice with bundles of charm.

<p dir="auto">Tool-calling is expensive. Every MCP call is a round trip through the model:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="LLM → tool → LLM → tool → LLM → tool → ..."><pre><code>LLM → tool → LLM → tool → LLM → tool → ...

<p dir="auto">Ten tool calls = ten LLM invocations. Code mode collapses this:</p>

<p dir="auto">But you can't just eval whatever the model spits out. So people either pay the token tax or run unsafe code. This gives you both: code-mode efficiency with actual isolation.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Recently <a href="https://x.com/Merocle/status/2015496917472489751">this post from @Merocle</a> caught my eye:</p><blockquote><p>I'm fixing my iFixit soldering station. I haven't used it for a long time and the battery has gone overdischarge. I hope it will come back to life. Unfortunately, there are no replacements available for sale at the moment.</p></blockquote><figure><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/ode-to-the-aa-battery/ifixit-soldering-usb-battery-merocle-torn-down.jpg" alt="iFixit soldering hub torn down - used with permission" width="500" height="auto"></figure><p>Devices with built-in rechargeable batteries have been bugging me a lot lately. It's convenient to have a device you can take with you and use anywhere. And with modern Li-ion cells, battery life is remarkable.</p><p>But for years, I've noticed the same thing happening to many devices as Merocle mentions above:</p><ol><li>I purchase the device, charge it to 100%, use it a bit.</li><li>Knowing Li-ion cells are better off in the 40-80% range, I store the device with the battery at that charge level.</li><li>The next time I go to use the device (a few months later), it won't power on.</li><li>I plug the device in to charge, and 1 in 4 times the device won't start charging!</li></ol><p>One problem is many devices don't have a proper BMS integrated into the charging circuit, that will cut power <em>before</em> the battery is below a critical threshold. Li-ion cells start to have problems below 3V, and often suffer permanent damage below 2.5V.</p><p>Devices from even the most stalwart right-to-repair companies suffer from undervoltage issues.</p><p>You <a href="https://www.eevblog.com/forum/beginners/reviving-a-0v-lithium-ion-battery/">can sometimes revive 'dead' Li-ion batteries</a>, but I don't recommend it unless you know what you're doing.</p><p>Assuming most people <em>don't</em> know what they're doing, when they pull out a piece of gear that won't turn on and has no obvious way of being repaired (especially with odd pouch-cell batteries, much less 18650 cells), these devices will <a href="https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/frequent-questions-regarding-epas-facts-and#CellPhones">most often end up in the trash</a>. Or if you're <em>lucky</em>, some people will try recycling them.</p><h2 id="enter-the-aa">Enter the AA</h2><p>Because of this trend, if I need portability, I look for devices that use AA and AAA batteries.</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/ode-to-the-aa-battery/eneloop-aa-batteries.jpeg" alt="eneloop AA batteries" width="700" height="auto"></figure><p>Each year for the past 14 years, I buy sets of <a href="https://amzn.to/49Gatuz">Panasonic eneloop batteries</a> to replace disposable AA batteries as they die. Eneloops have around 2000 mAh of capacity (versus 2100+ mAh for good alkaline batteries<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>), and run at a nominal 1.2V instead of the 1.5V of alkaline batteries.</p><p>But they can be recharged. Over and over. They can be pulled out of a device, with new batteries swapped in quickly. For long term storage, I can pop the batteries out and use them in <em>other</em> devices.</p><p>So far, across 128 batteries, I have not had a single incident of leakage, fire, etc., and even the cells I reserve for outdoor use (in devices that go from -12°F in the winter to 105°F+ in the summer) are still holding a charge, over a decade later.</p><p>Only <em>one</em> cell has had to be retired, out of all the eneloops I've purchased.</p><p>What prompted me to write this post is the soldering project I worked on during this weekend's snowstorm.</p><h2 id="universal-standards">Universal Standards</h2><p>I was putting together <a href="https://amzn.to/4qD2LHz">this clock</a> at my workbench, and at one point I needed to determine which resistor was 100KΩ and which was 1MΩ. I pulled out my Fluke multimeter, inserted two AAA batteries I had sitting on my bench (I keep 8 AA and 8 AAA batteries charged and ready at my workbench, and don't store them in my tools), and measured the resistors.</p><p>Upon doing so, I realized the clamp meter I was using (<a href="https://amzn.to/4bgJSFH">Fluke 323 True RMS Clamp Meter</a>) only measures between 400-4000Ω, so I switched to my old Craftsman meter that worked a treat—and uses a replaceable 9V battery!</p><p>It would be faster to leave the batteries in my tools, but over 40 years of sacrificing devices to alkaline cell leakage, it's my habit not to. So far I've never had leakage problems with the eneloops, but old habits die hard.</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/ode-to-the-aa-battery/sony-walkman-wm-fx281.jpg" alt="Sony Walkman WM-FX281 FM radio in use" width="700" height="auto"></figure><p>When I put away the meter, I noticed my wife's and old Sony Walkman sitting nearby. Just for fun, I popped in two AA batteries.</p><p>My wife had both a <a href="https://walkman.land/sony/wm-ex150">WM-EX150</a> (made in 1995) and a <a href="https://retrospekt.com/products/sony-walkman-wm-fx281-am-fm-portable-cassette-player">WM-FX281</a>. These are 31 and 25 years old, respectively—and outside the rubber belts being shot, the devices both work. The radio works good as new, and it would play cassettes again after a little maintenance.</p><p>The AAs might not last 32 hours, and the Walkman doesn't fit in tight jeans pockets, but they can still be as useful today as they were decades ago.</p><p>Looking at my stack of old tech, <em>every</em> device uses one of the standard AA, AAA, or C-sized batteries. And thinking of all the new devices I've purchased, the ones that worry me the least (regarding fire safety, and whether they're work the next time I pull them out)... are the ones with easily-replaceable batteries.</p><h2 id="no-batteries-at-all">No Batteries at All</h2><p>If I don't need portability, I prefer USB-C powered tools (with no battery).

<p><em>This story was produced and </em><a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/?p=1313453"><em>originally published by Wisconsin Watch</em></a><em>, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom. It was made possible by </em><a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/donate/"><em>donors like you</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>How did a $1 billion, 520-acre data center proposed by one of the world’s richest companies go unnoticed in tiny Beaver Dam, Wisconsin?</p>

<p>A key reason: In a city that lists “communication matters” atop its core values, officials took steps to keep the project hidden for more than a year.</p>
<div data-form-theme="gravity-theme" data-form-index="0" id="gform_wrapper_2">
                            <h2>News with a little more humanity</h2>

                        </div>

<p>Now Meta, the trillion-dollar company that owns Facebook and Instagram, is building a complex as big as 12 football fields in a city with a population of 16,000, enough to fill only a fifth of Lambeau Field.</p>

<p>It’s one of seven major data center projects pending in Wisconsin that combined are worth more than $57 billion.</p>



<p>In four of them, including Beaver Dam, local government officials kept the massive projects under wraps through confidential nondisclosure agreements, a Wisconsin Watch investigation has found.</p>

<p>Secrecy also occurred in the three communities without NDAs.</p>

<p>In one, the Madison suburb of DeForest, officials worked behind the scenes for months before publicly announcing a proposed $12 billion data center, which residents are fighting.</p>

<p>The lack of public disclosure, while relatively common for typical development proposals in the planning stages, raises questions about how much time the public should have to digest projects that dramatically affect the economy, land use, energy, taxes, the environment and more.</p>

<p>“As soon as community leadership is contemplating, even entertaining it, I think they need to make the public aware,” said retired tech executive Prescott Balch, who is advising residents around Wisconsin where data centers are proposed. “Even if it makes it harder, that’s the right way to do it. And nobody is doing it that way.”</p>

<p>Blowback from residents who have been kept in the dark has spurred a new legislative proposal that would ban data center NDAs statewide.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-beaver-dam-did-it">How Beaver Dam did it</h2>

<p>Wisconsin has some 40 data centers, stretching from Kenosha to Eau Claire. But most are tiny compared with the big seven: three under construction in Beaver Dam, Mount Pleasant and Port Washington; and four proposed in DeForest, Janesville, Kenosha and Menomonie.</p>

<p>Besides storing and processing data, data centers are vital to advancing the use of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>A case study in how projects each worth $1 billion or more are kept quiet is Beaver Dam, the Dodge County burg an hour northeast of Madison, where Meta’s data center is expected to open in 2027.</p>

<p>The Beaver Dam Area Development Corp., a quasi-government nonprofit that functions as the city’s economic development arm, signed <a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:va6c2:50756a5e-e5ec-4bd5-8610-b41a738634b2?viewer%21megaVerb=group-discover">an NDA</a> on Dec. 1, 2023, not with Meta, but with a shell company no one had ever heard of, Balloonist LLC.</p>

<p>The agreement referred only to a “project,” making no mention of a data center or Meta.</p>

<p>The NDA was signed “very early, almost in the introductory period of that project,” the development corporation’s leader, Trent Campbell, told Wisconsin Watch. All major development projects have “different levels of confidentiality for different purposes. And this entity believed it to be necessary at the onset of the conversations.”</p>

<p>The NDA meant that the Beaver Dam Area Development Corp. could not reveal its discussions with Balloonist, or even disclose “the existence of the project.”</p>

<p>The NDA also put the wheels in motion.</p>

<p>For more than a year, the city quietly took official actions to make the data center a reality, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>July 2024: The city council voted 12-0 to approve a predevelopment agreement with another shell company, Degas LLC, that only later was identified with the data center. The agenda and the minutes of the meeting don’t mention a data center.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>November 2024: The city council created a tax incremental finance, or TIF, district for the data center to help fund development. The agenda and the minutes for that meeting do not mention a data center, though the agreement itself does.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not until February 2025 — 14 months after the NDA was signed — did the Beaver Dam Area Development Corp. announce that it and the city were working with a company — then still unidentified — on a “potential data center project.”</p>

<p>Campbell noted to Wisconsin Watch that Gov. Tony Evers and other officials had identified the site for a major development as far back as 2019. For months after the NDA was signed, it wasn’t known whether the data center would come to fruition, he added.</p>

<p>“I know the opponents currently disagree, but I think the city acted in as transparent a way as they could,” Campbell said.</p>

<p>Eventually, a <a href="https://www.wpr.org/news/bloomberg-meta-developer-beaver-dam-data-center?utm_source=chatgpt.com">news report</a> in April 2025 identified Meta, which declined comment for this story, as the company likely behind the data center.</p>

<p>Meta confirmed its involvement eight months later, saying on Facebook: “We’re proud to call Beaver Dam home. We are honored to have joined such an incredible community in 2025.”</p>

<p>The first reply to that post was from a Beaver Dam resident, who wrote: “We would have been honored to have the opportunity to decline this.”</p>

<h2 id="h-secrecy-without-an-nda">Secrecy without an NDA</h2>

<p>NDAs also helped keep the public in the dark about data centers under consideration in the three other cities that used them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Menomonie signed <a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:va6c2:831b84d9-1fa7-4189-b926-fd2991b346e3?viewer%21megaVerb=group-discover">its NDA</a> with Balloonist LLC in February 2024 — more than a year before the city in northwest Wisconsin announced a $1.6 billion data center proposal in July 2025. Two months after the NDA, the city council unanimously helped pave the way for a data center by changing a land use ordinance. The change gave, for the first time, a definition of the ordinance’s reference to “warehousing,” saying warehousing includes data centers. The city’s mayor put the proposed data center on hold in September 2025. In January 2026, the city council adopted a zoning ordinance for data centers that reversed the warehousing definition. “Based upon feedback from the community and elected officials, it is clear that additional discussion should occur regarding the appropriate level of regulation of data centers,” the city’s public works director told the council and the mayor.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Kenosha signed <a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:va6c2:2a412b0d-f8e5-49df-849c-9eeed53bf645?viewer%21megaVerb=group-discover">its NDA</a>, with Microsoft, in May 2024, six months before news reports surfaced saying the NDA kept the proposed data center operator’s name confidential. It was later announced that Microsoft had purchased 240 acres in the neighboring town of Paris, which the city annexed in December 2024. No dollar amount for the proposal has been announced.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Janesville announced in July 2025 it was approached by developers about a data center and put out a request for proposal. The city signed <a href="https://cityofjanesville.nextrequest.com/documents/56325277?token=066aa628b4a5da64f68345a4f44b0993">its NDA</a> two months later and is now in negotiations with Viridian Acquisitions, a Colorado developer, for an $8 billion data center.</li>
</ul>

<p>Port Washington in Ozaukee County and Mount Pleasant in Racine County responded to records requests from Wisconsin Watch saying they had not signed NDAs for their data centers.</p>

<p>In Port Washington, where three people were arrested during a city council meeting on the data center in December, residents are trying to recall Mayor Ted Neitzke, saying he has been secretive about the $15 billion data center from OpenAI, Oracle and Vantage Data Centers.</p>

<p>In Mount Pleasant, Microsoft this month announced plans to add 15 data centers, worth $13 billion, to the $7 billion complex under construction there.</p>

<p>NDAs are described by economic development officials as necessary and criticized by data center opponents as against the public interest.</p>

<p>NDAs and other steps to protect confidentiality are crucial at the early stages of a development proposal, said Tricia Braun, executive director of the Wisconsin Data Center Coalition.</p>

<p>“If I’m a company considering making strategic investments, regardless of industry, I don’t want my competition to know where I’m going, what I’m doing, what pace I’m doing it at,” said Braun, a former executive at the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. “You want to make sure everything is buttoned up and bow tied before that type of information is put into the public realm.”</p>

<p>Questions have swirled around transparency even in communities where local government officials did not sign NDAs.</p>

<p>That includes DeForest, which lists “communicate clearly” among its core values.</p>

<p>The DeForest data center, proposed by Virginia-based QTS Data Centers, is controversial, in part, because the village board would have to annex 1,600 acres in the neighboring town of Vienna.</p>

<p>At one DeForest Village Board meeting about the project, Village President Jane Cahill Wolfgram said that based on emails she had been receiving from residents, there was “just one thing I think we need to clear up.”</p>

<p>“And you can ask any one of these board members. They will tell you, they just learned about this project in the last couple of weeks.”</p>

<p>That was Nov. 18, 2025.</p>

<p>But Village Board trustees had been offered one-on-one meetings with the developer some 10 weeks earlier, trustee Jan Steffenhagen-Hahn said in an email to Vienna resident Shawn Haney.</p>

<p>“Because of the scale of this project,” that’s when residents should have been notified, said Haney, a leader of a group that opposes the data center.</p>

<p>Other <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UouElwIyBrKAqNnfeQrYrEnif9lPJjlR_Vx4mMtTE8U/edit?usp=sharing">emails</a> obtained by the group show that DeForest staff were strategizing with QTS representatives and Alliant Energy as early as March 2025 — seven months before announcing the proposal last October.</p>

<p>In one email, the village planner discussed with QTS representatives when to seek various village approvals, including annexation, while acknowledging that doing so without disclosing “any details of the project or operations will be difficult.”</p>

<p>Cahill Wolfgram told Wisconsin Watch she in fact had met with QTS on Oct. 1, three weeks before the public announcement. She expressed frustration that many residents are urging trustees to stop the data center.</p>

<p>“They’ve been brought in from the very early moments of this discussion and they have continued to be front and center of everything we’ve done,” Cahill Wolfgram said. “As village president, I know of nothing that has been done behind the scenes.”</p>

<p>A public hearing on the annexation is scheduled for Feb. 9.</p>

<p>The state Department of Administration, which reviews annexation proposals and issues advisory opinions, concluded the DeForest annexation is not in the public interest because of concerns over how the village would provide water and sewer services for the annexed area.</p>

<p>The Clean Economy Coalition of Wisconsin has called for state leaders to pause consideration of any data centers until a comprehensive strategy on them is adopted. In part, the coalition said comprehensive planning is needed to avoid more “stranded assets.”</p>

<p>Wisconsin Watch <a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/2025/12/wisconsin-stranded-assets-power-plants-energy-data-centers-ratepayers-utility-cost/">reported</a> in December that Wisconsin utility ratepayers owe nearly $1 billion for stranded assets — coal power plants that have been or soon will be shut down. A push to provide new energy capacity for data centers poses the risk of creating more stranded assets.</p>

<h2 id="h-some-states-targeting-ndas">Some states targeting NDAs</h2>

<p>Microsoft on Jan. 13 announced new standards aimed at being a “good neighbor in the communities where we build, own and operate our data centers.” It mentioned transparency five times.</p>

<p>But University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee researchers called Microsoft’s initial Mount Pleasant data center a “microcosm of a larger problem with secrecy and lack of transparency about water and electricity demands” of data centers throughout the country. That, they wrote, “harms the public’s ability to determine whether hosting a data center is in their best interest.”</p>

<p>Mount Pleasant has wanted a major development where the data center is now under construction because a massive development signed with Foxconn in 2017 largely fell through.</p>

<p>Local government use of NDAs and other methods to keep data center development secret is widespread <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251210002845/https:/www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/data-center-ai-google-amazon-nda-non-disclosure-agreement-colossus-rcna236423">across</a> the U.S.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251124232515/https:/minnesotareformer.com/2025/10/29/want-an-ai-data-center-in-your-city-sure-but-first-sign-this-non-disclosure-agreement/">Minnesota</a>, local elected officials were aware of data center proposals for months or even years before disclosing them. In <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/04/30/data-centers-non-disclosure-agreements-and-democracy/">Virginia</a>, 25 out of 31 data center projects had NDAs. In one <a href="https://archive.is/pi9uG">New Mexico</a> county, county staff negotiated for a $165 billion data center with an NDA that kept elected officials in the dark.</p>

<p>Several states are targeting NDAs.</p>

<p>At least three — <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2026/484">Florida</a>, <a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/Bills/Bill?ObjectName=2025-HB-5399">Michigan</a> and <a href="https://legiscan.com/NJ/bill/S5003/2024">New Jersey</a> — are considering legislation to prohibit governments from signing data center NDAs. A <a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/72340">Georgia</a> bill would prohibit NDAs that hide information about data center electricity or water usage. <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S373">New York</a> is considering a bill to limit NDAs for economic development proposals generally.</p>

<p>Now, similar legislation is pending in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Last week, state Rep. Clint Moses, R-Menomonie, citing questions about transparency over the Menomonie proposal, introduced <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eQHv35HE1GxorIxlm1YSqkagngepVJGZ_aLDDpnyf_s/edit?usp=sharing">a bill</a> to prohibit NDAs for data center proposals in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen such overwhelming opposition from all sides of the aisle,” he told Wisconsin Watch, describing constituents’ feelings about data centers and secrecy surrounding them.</p>

<p>Moses said he understands the need for confidentiality in economic development generally, but that because data centers have such widespread impact, public notice is paramount.</p>

<p>“The earlier the better,” he said.</p>

<p>Braun, the data centers coalition leader, said the public should be notified when a data center proposal is ready to be considered for approvals by elected officials — after municipal staff do due diligence to determine whether things such as zoning, utility capacity, water and sewer would make a proposal potentially viable.</p>

<p>Balch, who helped defeat a proposed data center in the Racine County village of Caledonia, where he lives, said the public should be alerted well before local elected officials consider such votes.</p>

<p>“You have to use your judgment,” he said. “But at some point, you need to realize this is not a normal thing and we need to look out for the residents.”</p>

		<p>TLDR; <em>Software development, as it has been done for decades, is over. LLM coding tools have changed it fundamentally for the better or worse.</em></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>“Talk is cheap. Show me the code.” — Linus Torvalds, August 2000</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, made this quip in response to a claim about a complex piece of programming in the Linux kernel, <sup><a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/25/132" rel="noopener">[1]</a></sup>
 I was an oblivious, gangly, fledgling teenage n00b coder learning by copy-pasting open source Perl and VB snippets over dialup internet.</p>
<p>The quip has since become an adage in the software world. The gist of it back then was that, it was easy to talk about all the software stuff one would like to do, or could be hypothetically done, but unless one actually put in the effort and proved it, talk wasn’t of much value. Writing and proving good software was a high-effort, high-cost, high-skill endeavour.</p>
<p>Even when armed with a crystal clear software development plan and the exact know-how to implement it, any sufficiently complex piece of programming is high-effort, tedious, and time consuming to actually write and get to a form where it is functional, reliable, and at least reasonably future-ready. In the process of developing software, any number of unforeseen complexities and gotchas can arise with many unresolvable trade-offs,<sup><a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/26/52" rel="noopener">[2]</a></sup>
 both technical and external. It is not uncommon for software architectures to change mid-way multiple times. The cost of <em>just</em> trying things out is so exponentially high that the significant majority of ideas are simply never tried out.</p>
<p>After all, the real bottleneck is good old physical and biological human constraints—cognitive bandwidth, personal time and resources, and most importantly, the biological cost and constraints of having to sit for indefinite periods, writing code with one’s own hands line by line even if it is all in one’s head, while juggling and context-switching through the mental map of large systems. And if it is more than one individual, a whole host of interpersonal coordination and communication dynamics come into play. It is thus very difficult to prototype and try out not just grand ideas, but even reasonably simple ones. As many of us have done, most ideas are generally appended to a bottomless wishlist where they very likely stay forever. That’s how I have programmed and written software on a regular basis and enjoyed it—from hobby stuff to critical systems that millions of people depend on—for about 25 years.</p>
<p>All that has now been thrown out of the window, of course, for better or worse.</p>
<p>Coming back to Linus, fast-forward 25 years, when he merges a chunk of AI-generated code into his toy project and comments <em>“Is this much better than I could do by hand? Sure is.”</em>, <sup><a href="https://github.com/torvalds/AudioNoise/commit/93a72563cba609a414297b558cb46ddd3ce9d6b5" rel="noopener">[3]</a></sup>
 I, no longer the fledgling n00b, but someone with decades of software development scars and calluses (both physical and metaphorical), am able to grasp its implications. Not only that, now with a sizeable amount of first-hand experience with LLM-assisted coding, I am compelled to say, software development, as it has been done for decades, is over. Along with that, many other things are too.</p>
<p>I say that with the full awareness that it smacks of Fukuyama’s <em>The End of History</em>, <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man" rel="noopener">[4]</a></sup>
 but I will reiterate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Software development, as it has been done for decades, is over.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="i">I</h2>
<p>I was lucky to be in the transitionary Goldilocks era to witness and to partake in the breakneck evolution of the internet and software landscape—dialup to DSL to gigabit; Basic, Visual Basic 4/5/6 and Delphi; rise and fall of cgi-bin; Altavista to Google; XMLHttpRequest kicking off Web 2.0; rise and fall of Flash; death of IE and the rise of Chrome; WAP to Symbian to Android and smartphone apps; the demise of SourceForge and the massive proliferation and success of FOSS (Free and Open-source Software); git and GitHub; rise of SaaS; ExpertsExchange to StackOverflow; the growth of the Linux world; sysadmin to devops to whateverOps; the ominous birthing of Node.js and MongoDB in the same year; microservices; the explosion of VC-funded software “unicorns”; crypto and web3 shams; the rapid darkening of patterns; widespread enshittification and monetisation of privacy, attention, and dignity; and the monumental bloating of software that has since become the norm.</p>
<p>All throughout this, I have been writing, maintaining, and deploying software both as a professional developer and as a FOSS hobbyist dabbling in a gazillion languages, frameworks, tools, and methodologies. From thinking that “indenting code is lame” (cringe) as a teen, from copy-pasting to CVS to svn to git, fighting space vs. tab battles, to maturing to “whatever floats your boat” and still regularly compressing PNGs to shave off a few KBs, I have been a dabbler, dilettante, and an addict, someone who has unconditionally enjoyed writing code and developing software.</p>
<p>But now? How I develop software now is not how I have done it all these years, all the right, wrong, good, bad, easy and hard bits combined. With the advent of code-assisting LLMs, it has been completely flipped on its head, and I don’t think there is any going back.</p>
<p>Now, that is some “Tears in rain”-esque <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_in_rain_monologue" rel="noopener">[5]</a></sup>
 monologue right there.</p>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Barring a bunch of obvious objective 101s, there is no universal measure of what makes a codebase good or great. Styles, idioms, patterns, architectures all vary greatly. Even objectively provable technical choices are subject to trade-offs that defy consensus. For a software developer like me, historically, there have been a few rule-of-thumb indicators for quick evaluation of software. When I evaluate a FOSS project, I look at a bunch of factors, all a mix of objective and subjective, weighted differently under different contexts—the project’s age; is the commit activity overly sparse or frantic; frameworks and dependencies; is code consistently organised and commented without being over-abstracted; is there a community around it; are maintainers responsive; can I actually get it up and running quickly from a clear README; the quality and depth of its documentation …</p>
<p>Many of these rule-of-thumb signals give a reasonable glimpse of the mental model and the style of working of the maintainers and the likely future trajectory of the project. For example, concise comments, README, and documentation indicate thoughtfulness, extra effort, and empathy for other developers (and self). Mainly because, for mortal developers like me, documentation and tests are a necessity, but unpleasant, boring, and tedious things to write and maintain.</p>
<p>Well, those notions have now been abruptly and violently defenestrated by LLMs. They can now one-shot generate stunning looking documentation pages, dense (ironically, pedantically detailed) READMEs, build great looking user interfaces, neatly organise code with proper idioms, patterns, and comments. One can no longer know whether such a repository was “vibe” coded by a non-technical person who has never written a single line of code, or an experienced developer, who may or may not have used LLM assistance. These no longer indicate the quality of a codebase. On the contrary, the more stunning or perfect looking something is, the more suspicious it is now—was it low-effort, one-shot vibe coded?</p>
<p>With the tell-tale, rule-of-thumb measures of code and software quality being outright dead, without a much closer inspection and a bit of expert forensic analysis, it is now difficult to tell the wheat from the “slop”. One is now slowly being compelled to also look much more closely at the provenance of software—the who, why, their track record, and plans of governance.</p>
<h2 id="effort">Effort</h2>
<p>Historically, it would take a reasonably long period of consistent effort and many iterations of refinement for a good developer to produce 10,000 lines of quality code that not only delivered meaningful results, but was easily readable and maintainable. While the number of lines of code is not a measure of code quality—it is often the inverse—a codebase with good quality 10,000 lines of code indicated significant time, effort, focus, patience, expertise, and often, skills like project management that went into it. Human traits.</p>
<p>Now, LLMs can not only one-shot generate that in seconds, they can handle many technical aspects of the software development workflow, from testing to sysadmin to publishing. Unlike the unpredictable outcomes of frenzied vibe coding, when steered with human expertise, the output can be high quality and highly effective.<sup><a href="https://github.com/antirez/flux2.c" rel="noopener">[6]</a></sup>
 This has been my personal experience as well. On a regular basis, I have been compressing work that would have taken me weeks and months to mere days and even hours. That too, without vibe coding, an AGENT.md file, or any fancy multi-agent workflows or orchestration. Just an LLM agent CLI at arm’s length.</p>
<p>As a developer with a bottomless wishlist of things I wish I could have done or tried out, I have been able to use LLM tools to not just rapidly prototype and validate complex ideas, but actually write good quality production-grade software (my own subjective metric, of course) with better code than I could have written manually—things where I knew exactly what I had to do, but was constrained by physical limits, and also things that were unclear to me and needed novel ideas, approaches, and leaps. All the while, learning and bettering my own understanding of things.</p>
<p>The physiological, cognitive, and emotional cost I generally incur to achieve the software outcomes I want or am capable of engineering, has undoubtedly reduced by several orders of magnitude. The time and bandwidth this has freed up, I now spend on engineering, architecting, debating, tinkering, trying to expand my imagination, and writing much more concise and meaningful code that I actually want to write.</p>
<p>Remember the old adage, “programming is 90% thinking and 10% typing”? It is now, for real.</p>
<h2 id="slop">Slop</h2>
<p>Given all that, what is the <em>value</em> of code as an artefact, when it can be generated at an industrial scale within seconds by someone who has never written any code? Barring obviously bad LLM-generated code, when code is neatly structured and functional (yes, LLMs can write good code when steered competently), what makes it valuable or not? We wouldn’t want LLM-generated code in systems out there in the real world, but would instead prefer pure unadulterated human code, yes? Well, that would be a wonderful joke.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages" rel="noopener">[7]</a></sup>

<p>The reality is that the significant majority of the code written by humans globally on a daily basis, is likely borderline junk.<sup><a href="https://www.it-cisq.org/the-cost-of-poor-quality-software-in-the-us-a-2022-report/" rel="noopener">[12]</a></sup>
 Software development is <a href="https://nadh.in/blog/on-software-as-an-indiscipline/">not even a discipline</a> that has reached any objective level of maturity. Medical doctors and civil engineers go through rigorous training to be issued licenses that are contingent on real world ramifications of their work. How about software developers and engineers? The world runs on shoddily engineered, poorly cobbled together, bloated systems with garbage code that humans have written, mostly directed by people in positions of power with perverse incentives who have absolutely no technical know-how or have any grounding in the humanities—the tyranny of non-tech “tech leaders”.<sup><a href="https://zerodha.tech/blog/being-future-ready-with-common-sense/#8-the-tyranny-of-non-technical-tech-leaders" rel="noopener">[13]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>One could, to trigger emotions, argue that AI slop is at least neatly formatted, well documented, and more syntactically consistent than the vast majority of human-written code. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</p>
<p>Kidding aside, I am no fan of AI slop. Reading those obvious soulless LLM-generated messages and articles on the (dead) internet<sup><a href="https://nadh.in/blog/decentralised-open-indexes/#quality" rel="noopener">[14]</a></sup>
 is a waste of neuronal activation in the amygdala, if there is any activation at all. That so many people across the world LLM-speak and emote in the exact same manner on the internet, is creepy self-<em>Pluribus</em>-ification.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluribus_%28TV_series%29" rel="noopener">[15]</a></sup>
 Without human creation, perfection and flaws, language, literature, art, music etc. are unenjoyable (to most). Infinite, instantly-generatable stuff without human constraints and limits, is actually very difficult to value.</p>
<p>As is code, then? Well, code is a bit different from art, literature, or any form of direct communication and evocation. Code was always a means to an end. Unlike poetry or prose, end users don’t read or care about code. They don’t care what language or framework or the architecture the hundred systems running behind a portal are made of. Code is hidden. They interact with the effect and outcomes of code through various forms of UX. I say that, slightly begrudgingly, as someone who enjoys writing, organising, and even nurturing code. For those who are immersed in it, there is an element of creativity and art in it, and many like me, are borderline curmudgeons on all things software.<sup><a href="https://zerodha.tech/authors/knadh/" rel="noopener">[16]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Ignoring outright bad code, in a world where functional code is so abundant that “good” and “bad” are indistinguishable, ultimately, what makes functional AI code slop or non-slop? I am strongly inclined to think that it is the framework of accountability, and ironically, the element of humanness. That is, all things (code) being equal, the ability to hold someone accountable at least emotionally and morally (and sometimes legally), for an artefact, instills value.</p>
<p>When one gets that big pull request (PR) on an open source repository, irrespective of its quality, if it is handwritten by a human, there is an intrinsic value and empathy for the human time and effort that is likely ascribed to it. It is known that there is a physical and cognitive cost that has been paid writing a lot of code before raising a PR. That is what makes that code “expensive” and not cheap.</p>
<p>When a PR is obviously LLM-generated, irrespective of how good it is, the first reaction is likely to be “slop!”, because it is no longer possible to instantly ascertain the human effort behind it. On the other hand, the effort required to read and validate it is disproportionately and exponentially high—setting aside people who have also offloaded reading of code to LLMs. It may very well be the best possible functional code, but it is one out of an infinite possible variation that could have been generated with no human cost or effort. Emotionally, it feels wrong and unfair to be burdened by such code dumps.</p>
<p>And, at that point, our reality has become a version of Borges’ Library of Babel.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel" rel="noopener">[17]</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="foss">FOSS</h2>
<p>Speaking of libraries, FOSS is perhaps the greatest public commons that humanity has created. The genesis of FOSS and its predecessors, various schemes for sharing code, can be traced to the fundamental premise that software was prohibitively expensive and required immense specialist skills to create. Only a tiny handful of people in the world had the ability to do that, and everyone else was naturally forced to use the creations of the few (proprietary or not). While the global developer ecosystem has exploded since then, the ratio of makers to users has largely remained the same. Largescale FOSS collaboration and community dynamics all stem from that—codebases as valuable shared artefacts.</p>
<p>What happens in a world where code is cheap and small to medium-sized software libraries and modules can be quickly created by an expert, perfectly customised and attuned to their needs, no matter how niche? Forget expertise, a world where anyone reasonably savvy can vibe code the small things they need for their private use, however they please. I see this happening everywhere. What is happening to StackOverflow<sup><a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-has-basically-killed-stack-overflow" rel="noopener">[18]</a></sup>
 is also happening to software, although not as dramatically. This seems to strike at the very heart of the human dynamics, societal conditions, and incentives that drive FOSS collaboration and sharing. Add to that, if one considers the impending Cambrian explosion of FOSS projects manufactured at an unprecedented scale, the high-quality FOSS projects that remain and thrive, expert governance, curation, and trust are likely to become more valuable than the code itself.</p>
<h2 id="missing-the-forest-for-the-trees">Missing the forest for the trees</h2>
<p>Humans have produced amazing software when there was no syntax highlighting, IDEs, or any kind of tooling. And humans also produce trash despite all the tooling and resources in the world. A good competent developer with good articulation skills and care for quality will use LLMs, or any other tools, in their own ways to produce quality outcomes. An incompetent developer with poor articulation skills or one with a lack of care for quality, will produce bad stuff, LLMs or not.</p>
<p>Thus, the extreme proponents of manic “agentic” vibe coding,<sup><a href="https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown" rel="noopener">[19]</a></sup>
 and the outright denouncers of LLMs, are both missing the forest for the trees. That there is a pragmatic middle path, where people who have the experience, expertise, competence, and the ability to articulate can use these tools to get the outcomes they desire with the right sets of trade-offs.</p>
<p>Vibe coding has its place, especially for non-technical people, who, for the first time, can tinker, explore, have fun, and empower themselves with software. I see this happening all around me. However, the fanatical acolytes of vibe coding are missing a very important thing that makes humans take artefacts seriously—finitude. They’re generating a vast Borgesian library where they themselves are likely to be lost in an ocean of slop generated by sycophantic agents. Slop, not because the code is of poor quality, but because anything that can be generated infinitely without effort and has no meaningful provenance, is very hard to value or take seriously. Humans fundamentally do not deal well with an infinite supply of anything, especially choices. Completely unsurprising because we are heavily constrained biological beings that have evolved on a finite planet with finite resources to live out finite lifetimes.</p>
<p>And then, the denouncers, they can’t seem to get past the argument from incredulity.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_incredulity" rel="noopener">[20]</a></sup>
 They denounce LLMs because they don’t personally like them for whatever reason, or have been unable to get desirable outcomes, or had the wrong expectations about them, or have simply gotten sick of them. But that is immaterial because there is a sizeable population who are using the exact same tools fruitfully and have the opposite experience. I am one of them.</p>
<p>All that said, the widespread braindead and outright stupid and harmful implementations of these technologies fuelled by hype, frenzy, and greed are an unfortunate reality and a massive cause of concern. The AI-business bubble is perhaps one of the biggest in history. The rise of FOSS AI technologies makes one hopeful. However, to incorrectly conflate bad actors, bad actions, bean-counting, and nonsensical implementations with fundamental, physical capabilities of these technologies—not theoretical, but the regular, proven, and practical—is irrational. It is missing the forest for the trees.</p>
<h2 id="the-human-cost">The human cost</h2>
<p>All of this has been from the perspective of an experienced developer and engineer. For someone who has been weathered and bruised enough, these AI technologies provide extremely effective and powerful assistance.</p>
<p>But what about the young folks who are just starting out? If one does not have their fundamentals in place, if one has not developed an innate and nuanced understanding of systems and the process of software development, then these technologies are unreliable, dangerous genies. One asks for code, it gives code. One asks for changes, it gives changes. Soon, one is stuck with a codebase whose workings one doesn’t understand, and one is forced to go back to the genie and depend on it helplessly. And because one is hooked on and dependent on the genie, the natural circumstances that otherwise would allow for foundational and fundamental skills and understanding to develop, never arise, to the point of cognitive decline.<sup><a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/" rel="noopener">[21]</a></sup>
 What then happens to an entire generation of juniors, who never get an opportunity to become seniors meaningfully?</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t care about the extreme vibe coders or denouncers or even slop. We are all going to drown in a deluge of slop, from which, many islands of sanity, recovery, and a new order of software will emerge. The real concern is for generations of learners who are being robbed of the opportunity to acquire the expertise to objectively discern what is slop and what is not. Even worse, the possibility that experienced folks who use these tools effectively, will feel disincentivised from mentoring and training junior folks in foundational ways, something that was a natural part of societal evolution. And not just with software development, but the wholesale offloading of agency and decision-making to black boxes.</p>
<h2 id="talk">Talk</h2>
<p>At this point, for a hands-on developer, reading and critically evaluating code have become more important than learning syntax and typing it out line by line. Of course, that is still an important skill, because the ability to read code effectively comes from that in the first place. But, the daily software development workflows have flipped over completely.</p>
<p>An experienced developer who can <em>talk</em> well, that is, imagine, articulate, define problem statements, architect and engineer, has a massive advantage over someone who cannot, more disproportionately than ever. Knowledge of specific language, syntax, and frameworks—code—is no longer a bottleneck. The physiological constraints of yore are no longer impediments. The machinery for instantly creating code at scale is now a commodity and available to everyone, just a <a href="https://nadh.in/blog/on-powered-by-ai-marketing/#no-you-are-not-missing-out"><code>pip install</code> equivalent</a> away. It requires no special training, no new language or framework to learn, and has practically no entry barriers—<em>just</em> good old critical thinking and foundational human skills, and competence to run the machinery.</p>
<p>Conventional software development methodologies and roles—Waterfall<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model" rel="noopener">[22]</a></sup>
 to Agile,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" rel="noopener">[23]</a></sup>
 developer to tester, senior to junior—have fundamentally changed with traditional boundaries consolidating into unimaginably fast, compressed, blurry, iterative “agentic” loops. The dynamics of people, organisations, and public communities in software development, the very human incentives for sharing and collaboration,<sup><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/curl_ends_bug_bounty/" rel="noopener">[24]</a></sup>

 are all changing.</p>
<p>For the first time ever, good talk is exponentially more valuable than good code. The ramifications of this are significant and disruptive. This time, it is <a href="https://nadh.in/blog/this-time-it-feels-different/">different</a>.</p>

<p>Tesla’s nascent robotaxi program is off to a rough start. New NHTSA crash data, combined with Tesla’s new disclosure of robotaxi mileage, reveals Tesla’s autonomous vehicles are crashing at a rate much higher tha human drivers, and that’s with a safety monitor in every car.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-data">The data</h2>



<p>According to NHTSA’s Standing General Order crash reports, Tesla has reported 9 crashes involving its robotaxi fleet in Austin, Texas between July and November 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>November 2025:</strong> Right turn collision</li>



<li><strong>October 2025:</strong> Incident at 18 mph </li>



<li><strong>September 2025:</strong> Hit an animal at 27 mph</li>



<li><strong>September 2025:</strong> Collision with cyclist</li>



<li><strong>September 2025:</strong> Rear collision while backing (6 mph)</li>



<li><strong>September 2025:</strong> Hit a fixed object in parking lot</li>



<li><strong>July 2025:</strong> Collision with SUV in construction zone</li>



<li><strong>July 2025:</strong> Hit fixed object, causing minor injury (8 mph)</li>



<li><strong>July 2025:</strong> Right turn collision with SUV</li>
</ul>



<p>According to a chart in Tesla’s Q4 2025 earnings report showing cumulative robotaxi miles, the fleet has traveled approximately 500,000 miles as of November 2025. That works out to roughly one crash every 55,000 miles.</p>



<p>For comparison, human drivers in the United States average approximately one police-reported crash every 500,000 miles, according to NHTSA data.</p>	
	



<p>That means Tesla’s robotaxis are crashing at a rate <strong>9 times higher than the average human driver</strong>.</p>



<p>However, that figure doesn’t include non-police-reported incidents. When adding those, or rather an estimate of those, humans are closer to 200,000 miles between crashes, which is still a lot better than Tesla’s robotaxi in Austin.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-safety-monitor-problem">The safety monitor problem</h2>



<p>Here’s what makes this data particularly damning: every Tesla robotaxi in the reported mileage had a safety monitor in the vehicle who can intervene at any moment.</p>



<p>These aren’t fully autonomous vehicles operating without backup. There’s a human sitting in the car whose entire job is to prevent crashes. And yet Tesla’s crash rate is still nearly an order of magnitude worse than regular human drivers operating alone.</p>



<p>Waymo, by comparison, operates a fully driverless fleet, no safety monitor, no human backup, and reports significantly better safety numbers. Waymo has logged over 25 million autonomous miles and maintains a crash rate well below human averages.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-transparency-gap">The transparency gap</h2>



<p>Perhaps more troubling than the crash rate is Tesla’s complete lack of transparency about what happened.</p>



<p>Every single Tesla crash narrative in the NHTSA database is redacted with the same phrase: <strong>“[REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]”</strong></p>



<p>We know a Tesla robotaxi hit a cyclist. We don’t know what happened.<br>We know one caused a minor injury. We don’t know what happened.<br>We know one hit an animal at 27 mph. We don’t know what happened.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Waymo, Zoox, and other AV operators provide full narrative descriptions of every incident. Here’s a typical Waymo report from the same dataset:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The Waymo AV was traveling northbound on N. 16th Street in the left lane when it slowed to a stop to yield to a pedestrian that had begun crossing the roadway. While the pedestrian continued to cross and the Waymo AV remained stopped, a passenger car approaching from behind made contact with the rear of the stationary Waymo AV.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s accountability. That’s transparency. Tesla provides none of it.</p>



<p>It’s clear that Tesla is not responsible for some of these crashes, but the fact that we don’t know is entirely due to Tesla’s own secrecy.</p>



<p>A great example is an incident that happened last week in Santa Monica, California, where a Waymo hit a child in a school zone. That sounds awful, doesn’t it? Potentially a company-ending incident, but Waymo released all the details, which confirmed that the child ran into the street while hidden behind an SUV. The Waymo vehicle immediately detected the child and while it didn’t have to time to prevent the impact, it was able to apply the brakes and reduce the speed from 17 mph to under 6 mph before contact was made.</p>



<p>As a result, the child was OK. Waymo even claims that its models show that a human driver would have likely reacted more slowly and hit the kid at twice the speed.</p>



<p>It’s better to know about these incidents than to keep everything secret to avoid publicizing those you are responsible for.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>There’s good and there’s bad in this. With only a crash in October and one in November, there appears to be improvements.</p>



<p>But the overall data is sobering.</p>




	<p>A crash every 55,000 miles, with a safety monitor in the car, is not robotaxi-ready. It’s not even close. And the complete lack of transparency about what’s causing these crashes makes it impossible to have confidence that Tesla is learning from them.</p>



<p>Waymo operates fully driverless vehicles in multiple cities and publishes detailed information about every incident. Tesla operates supervised vehicles in one geofenced area and redacts everything.</p>



<p>If Tesla wants to be taken seriously as a robotaxi operator, it needs to do two things: dramatically improve its safety record, and start being honest about what’s happening on the roads of Austin.</p>



<p>Right now, it’s failing at both.</p>

After working for an indie game studio and acting as the family's go-to technician for all computer issues, he found his passion for writing and decided to use his skill set to write about all things tech.</p><p>

Since beginning his writing career, he has written for many different publications such as <a href="https://href.li/?https://web.archive.org/web/20161111224321/http://www.worldstart.com/author/sebatt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WorldStart</a>, <a href="https://listverse.com/lvauthor/S.E.%20Batt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Listverse</a>, and <a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/author/sebatt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MakeTechEasier</a>. However, after finding his home at <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/author/simon/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MakeUseOf</a> in February 2019, he would eventually move on to its sister site, XDA, to bring the latest and greatest in Windows, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity topics. </p></div>

<p>If you've never heard of GOG before, it stands for 'Good Old Games,' and its name gives away what kind of titles it sells. It's not all classic games, though; sometimes the company will publish newer titles with a retro feel to them that feel at home on the platform. Recently, the original co-founder of GOG bought the store back from its previous owner, CD Projekt Red, and declared they would survive under Steam's shadow by vetting games published on the platform.</p>    <p>Now, it seems they're making efforts to bring GOG over to Linux. As spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/gog-adds-linux-focus-to-gog-galaxy-engineering-role-linux-is-next-major-frontier" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">VideoCardz</a>, a recent job advertisement on the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/work/senior-software-engineer-c-gog-galaxy" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GOG website</a> revealed that the company is hiring a senior engineer to help with its optional library app, GOG Galaxy:</p>    <blockquote>
                        <p><strong>GOG GALAXY is our desktop client and ecosystem hub</strong> - the place where players manage their libraries, connect with the community, and access features that go far beyond a store. Today, it delivers experience on Windows and macOS, but Linux is the next major frontier.</p>    
                    <p>We’re looking for a Senior Engineer who will help shape GOG GALAXY’s architecture, tooling, and development standards with Linux in mind from day one. At the same time, GOG GALAXY is a long-lived product with a large and complex C++ codebase. </p>    
            </blockquote><p>While you don't need GOG Galaxy to play your purchased games, it's still nice to see the company working on making an app that runs on Linux natively. Here's hoping it's the first of many tweaks GOG is making to help Linux users relive the classics without any of the headaches.</p>    </div>

            <span>Abstract:</span>AI assistance produces significant productivity gains across professional domains, particularly for novice workers. Yet how this assistance affects the development of skills required to effectively supervise AI remains unclear. Novice workers who rely heavily on AI to complete unfamiliar tasks may compromise their own skill acquisition in the process. We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI. We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance. Our findings suggest that AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence and AI assistance should be carefully adopted into workflows to preserve skill formation -- particularly in safety-critical domains.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/AI-assistance-coding-skills">https://www.anthropic.com/research/AI-assistance-coding-skills</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46820924">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div data-theme="ivory"><p>Research shows AI helps people do <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4945566">parts</a> of their job faster. In an observational <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/estimating-productivity-gains">study</a> of <a href="http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.0495e873-eeb3-4ee5-aef9-0f7c2045739a">Claude.ai</a> data, we found AI can speed up some tasks by 80%. But does this increased productivity come with trade-offs? Other research shows that when people use AI assistance, they become <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-98385-2">less engaged with their work</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lee_2025_ai_critical_thinking_survey.pdf">reduce</a> the effort they put into doing it—in other words, they offload their thinking to AI.</p><p>It’s unclear whether this cognitive offloading can prevent people from growing their skills on the job, or—in the case of coding—understanding the systems they’re building. Our latest study, a randomized controlled trial with software developers as participants, investigates this potential downside of using AI at work.</p><p>This question has broad implications—for how to design AI products that facilitate learning, for how workplaces should approach AI policies, and for broader societal resilience, among others. We focused on coding, a field where AI tools have rapidly become standard. Here, AI creates a potential tension: as coding grows more automated and speeds up work, humans will still need the skills to catch errors, guide output, and ultimately provide oversight for AI deployed in high-stakes environments. Does AI provide a shortcut to <em>both </em>skill development and increased efficiency? Or do productivity increases from AI assistance undermine skill development?</p><p>In a randomized controlled trial, we examined 1) how quickly software developers picked up a new skill (in this case, a Python library) with and without AI assistance; and 2) whether using AI made them less likely to understand the code they’d just written.</p><p>We found that using AI assistance led to a statistically significant decrease in mastery. On a quiz that covered concepts they’d used just a few minutes before, participants in the AI group scored 17% lower than those who coded by hand, or the equivalent of nearly two letter grades. Using AI sped up the task slightly, but this didn’t reach the threshold of statistical significance.</p><p>Importantly, using AI assistance didn’t guarantee a lower score. <em>How</em> someone used AI influenced how much information they retained. The participants who showed stronger mastery used AI assistance not just to produce code but to build comprehension while doing so—whether by asking follow-up questions, requesting explanations, or posing conceptual questions while coding independently.</p><h2 id="study-design">Study design</h2><p>We recruited 52 (mostly junior) software engineers, each of whom had been using Python at least once a week for over a year. We also made sure they were at least somewhat familiar with AI coding assistance, and were unfamiliar with Trio, the Python library on which our tasks were based.</p><p>We split the study into three parts: a warm-up; the main task consisting of coding two different features using Trio (which requires understanding concepts related to asynchronous programming, a skill often learned in a professional setting); and a quiz. We told participants that a quiz would follow the task, but encouraged them to work as quickly as possible.</p><p>We designed the coding task to mimic how someone might learn a new tool through a self-guided tutorial. Each participant was given a problem description, starter code, and a brief explanation of the Trio concepts needed to solve it. We used an online coding platform with an AI assistant in the sidebar which had access to participants’ code and could at any time produce the correct code if asked.<sup>1</sup></p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="4584" height="2580" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fb009bf674206d736940ade254b112d1cf9fd380e-4584x2580.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fb009bf674206d736940ade254b112d1cf9fd380e-4584x2580.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure></div><h3 id="evaluation-design">Evaluation design</h3><p>In our evaluation design, we drew on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9962584">research in computer science education</a> to identify four types of questions commonly used to assess mastery of coding skills:</p><ul><li><strong>Debugging</strong>: The ability to identify and diagnose errors in code. This skill is crucial for detecting when AI-generated code is incorrect and understanding why it fails.</li><li><strong>Code reading</strong>: The ability to read and comprehend what code does. This skill enables humans to understand and verify AI-written code before deployment.</li><li><strong>Code writing:</strong> The ability to write or select the correct approach to writing code. Low-level code writing, like remembering the syntax of functions, will be less important with the further integration of AI coding tools than high-level system design.</li><li><strong>Conceptual</strong>: The ability to understand the core principles behind tools and libraries. Conceptual understanding is critical for assessing whether AI-generated code uses appropriate software design patterns that adhere to how the library is intended to be used.</li></ul><p>Our assessment focused most heavily on debugging, code reading, and conceptual problems, as we considered these the most important for providing oversight of what is increasingly likely to be AI-generated code.</p><h2 id="results">Results</h2><p>On average, participants in the AI group finished about two minutes faster, although the difference was not statistically significant. There was, however, a significant difference in test scores: the AI group averaged 50% on the quiz, compared to 67% in the hand-coding group—or the equivalent of nearly two letter grades (Cohen's <em>d</em>=0.738, <em>p</em>=0.01). The largest gap in scores between the two groups was on debugging questions, suggesting that the ability to understand when code is incorrect and why it fails may be a particular area of concern if AI impedes coding development.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="4584" height="2580" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fab5167a53ff0de956bd500b01b30d8aba028d843-4584x2580.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fab5167a53ff0de956bd500b01b30d8aba028d843-4584x2580.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure></div><h3 id="qualitative-analysis-ai-interaction-modes">Qualitative analysis: AI interaction modes</h3><p>We were particularly interested in understanding <em>how </em>participants went about completing the tasks we designed. In our qualitative analysis, we manually annotated screen recordings to identify how much time participants spent composing queries, what types of questions they asked, the types of errors they made, and how much time they spent actively coding.</p><p>One surprising result was how much time participants spent interacting with the AI assistant. Several took up to 11 minutes (30% of the total time allotted) composing up to 15 queries. This helped to explain why, on average, participants using AI finished faster although the productivity improvement was not statistically significant. We expect AI would be more likely to significantly increase productivity when used on repetitive or familiar tasks.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, participants in the No AI group encountered more errors. These included errors in syntax and in Trio concepts, the latter of which mapped directly to topics tested on the evaluation. Our hypothesis is that the participants who encountered more Trio errors (namely, the control group) likely improved their debugging skills through resolving these errors independently.</p><p>We then grouped participants by how they interacted with AI, identifying distinct patterns that led to different outcomes in completion time and learning.</p><p><strong>Low-scoring interaction patterns</strong>: The low-scoring patterns generally involved a heavy reliance on AI, either through code generation or debugging. The average quiz scores in this group were less than 40%. They showed less independent thinking and more cognitive offloading. We further separated them into:</p><ul><li><strong>AI delegation</strong> (<em>n</em>=4): Participants in this group wholly relied on AI to write code and complete the task. They completed the task the fastest and encountered few or no errors in the process.</li><li><strong>Progressive AI reliance</strong> (<em>n</em>=4): Participants in this group started by asking one or two questions but eventually delegated all code writing to the AI assistant. They scored poorly on the quiz largely due to not mastering any of the concepts on the second task.</li><li><strong>Iterative AI debugging</strong> (<em>n</em>=4): Participants in this group relied on AI to debug or verify their code. They asked more questions, but relied on the assistant to solve problems, rather than to clarify their own understanding. They scored poorly as a result, and were also slower at completing the two tasks.</li></ul><p><strong>High-scoring interaction patterns:</strong> We considered high-scoring quiz patterns to be behaviors where the average quiz score was 65% or higher. Participants in these clusters used AI both for code generation and conceptual queries.</p><ul><li><strong>Generation-then-comprehension</strong> (<em>n</em>=2): Participants in this group first generated code and then manually copied or pasted the code into their work. After their code was generated, they asked the AI assistant follow-up questions to improve understanding. These participants were not particularly fast when using AI, but showed a higher level of understanding on the quiz. Interestingly, this approach looked nearly the same as that of the AI delegation group, except for the fact that they used AI to check their own understanding.</li><li><strong>Hybrid code-explanation</strong> (<em>n</em>=3): Participants in this group composed hybrid queries in which they asked for code generation along with explanations of the generated code. Reading and understanding the explanations they asked for took more time, but helped in their comprehension.</li><li><strong>Conceptual inquiry</strong> (<em>n</em>=7): Participants in this group only asked conceptual questions and relied on their improved understanding to complete the task. Although this group encountered many errors, they also independently resolved them. On average, this mode was the fastest among high-scoring patterns and second fastest overall, after AI delegation.</li></ul><p>Our qualitative analysis does not draw a causal link between interaction patterns and learning outcomes, but it does point to behaviors associated with different learning outcomes.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Our results suggest that incorporating AI aggressively into the workplace, particularly with respect to software engineering, comes with trade-offs. The findings highlight that not all AI-reliance is the same: the way we interact with AI while trying to be efficient affects how much we learn. Given time constraints and organizational pressures, junior developers or other professionals may rely on AI to complete tasks as fast as possible at the cost of skill development—and notably the ability to debug issues when something goes wrong.</p><p>Though preliminary, these results suggest important considerations as companies transition to a greater ratio of AI-written to human-written code. Productivity benefits may come at the cost of skills necessary to validate AI-written code if junior engineers’ skill development has been stunted by using AI in the first place. Managers should think intentionally about how to deploy AI tools at scale, and consider systems or intentional design choices that ensure engineers continue to learn as they work—and are thus able to exercise meaningful oversight over the systems they build.</p><p>For novice workers in software engineering or any other industry, our study can be viewed as a small piece of evidence toward the value of intentional skill development with AI tools. Cognitive effort—and even getting painfully stuck—is likely important for fostering mastery. This is also a lesson that applies to how individuals choose to work with AI, and which tools they use. Major LLM services also provide learning modes (e.g., <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/output-styles">Claude Code Learning and Explanatory</a> mode or <a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-study-mode/">ChatGPT Study Mode</a>) designed to foster understanding. Knowing how people learn when using AI can also help guide how we design it; AI assistance should enable humans to work more efficiently <em>and</em> develop new skills at the same time.</p><p>Prior studies have found mixed results on whether AI <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06590">helps</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09089">hinders</a> coding productivity. Our own <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/estimating-productivity-gains">research</a> found that AI can reduce the time it takes to complete some work tasks by 80%—a result that may seem in tension with the findings presented here. But the two studies ask different questions and use different methods: our earlier observational work measured productivity on tasks where participants already had the relevant skills, while this study examines what happens when people are learning something new. It is possible that AI both accelerates productivity on well-developed skills and hinders the acquisition of new ones, though more research is needed to understand this relationship.</p><p>This study is only a first step towards uncovering how human-AI collaboration affects the experience of workers. Our sample was relatively small, and our assessment measured comprehension shortly after the coding task. Whether immediate quiz performance predicts longer-term skill development is an important question this study does not resolve. There remain many unanswered questions we hope future studies will investigate, for example: the effects of AI on tasks beyond coding, whether this effect dissipates longitudinally as engineers develop greater fluency, and whether AI assistance differs from human assistance while learning.</p><p>Ultimately, to accommodate skill development in the presence of AI, we need a more expansive view of the impacts of AI on workers. In an AI-augmented workplace, productivity gains matter, but so does the long-term development of the expertise those gains depend on.</p><p>Read the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20245">full paper </a>for details.</p><h3 id="acknowledgments"><br>Acknowledgments</h3><p>This project was led by Judy Hanwen Shen and Alex Tamkin.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://openclaw.ai/blog/introducing-openclaw">https://openclaw.ai/blog/introducing-openclaw</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46820783">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-7jjqptxk=""> <p>Two months ago, I hacked together a weekend project. What started as “WhatsApp Relay” now has over 100,000 GitHub stars and drew 2 million visitors in a single week.</p>
<p>Today, I’m excited to announce our new name: <strong>OpenClaw</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-naming-journey">The Naming Journey</h2>
<p>We’ve been through some names.</p>
<p><strong>Clawd</strong> was born in November 2025—a playful pun on “Claude” with a claw. It felt perfect until Anthropic’s legal team politely asked us to reconsider. Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>Moltbot</strong> came next, chosen in a chaotic 5am Discord brainstorm with the community. Molting represents growth - lobsters shed their shells to become something bigger. It was meaningful, but <a href="https://x.com/NetworkChuck/status/2016254397496414317" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it never quite rolled off the tongue</a>.</p>
<p><strong>OpenClaw</strong> is where we land. And this time, we did our homework: trademark searches came back clear, domains have been purchased, migration code has been written. The name captures what this project has become:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open</strong>: Open source, open to everyone, community-driven</li>
<li><strong>Claw</strong>: Our lobster heritage, a nod to where we came from</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-openclaw-is">What OpenClaw Is</h2>
<p>OpenClaw is an open agent platform that runs on your machine and works from the chat apps you already use. WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Teams—wherever you are, your AI assistant follows.</p>
<p><strong>Your assistant. Your machine. Your rules.</strong></p>
<p>Unlike SaaS assistants where your data lives on someone else’s servers, OpenClaw runs where you choose—laptop, homelab, or VPS. Your infrastructure. Your keys. Your data.</p>
<h2 id="whats-new-in-this-release">What’s New in This Release</h2>
<p>Along with the rebrand, we’re shipping:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Channels</strong>: Twitch and Google Chat plugins</li>
<li><strong>Models</strong>: Support for KIMI K2.5 &amp; Xiaomi MiMo-V2-Flash</li>
<li><strong>Web Chat</strong>: Send images just like you can in messaging apps</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: 34 security-related commits to harden the codebase</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d like to thank all security folks for their hard work in helping us harden the project. We’ve released <a href="https://github.com/vignesh07/clawdbot-formal-models" target="_blank" rel="noopener">machine-checkable security models</a> this week and are continuing to work on additional security improvements. Remember that prompt injection is still an industry-wide unsolved problem, so it’s important to use strong models and to study our <a href="https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security best practices</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-ahead">The Road Ahead</h2>
<p>What’s next? Security remains our top priority. We’re also focused on gateway reliability and adding polish plus support for more models and providers.</p>
<p>This project has grown far beyond what I could maintain alone. Over the last few days I’ve worked on adding maintainers and we’re slowly setting up processes so we can deal with the insane influx of PRs and Issues. I’m also figuring out how to pay maintainers properly—full-time if possible. If you wanna help, consider <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributing</a> or <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/openclaw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sponsoring the org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you">Thank You</h2>
<p>To the Claw Crew—every clawtributor who’s shipped code, filed issues, joined our Discord, or just tried the project: thank you. You are what makes OpenClaw special.</p>
<p>The lobster has molted into its final form. Welcome to OpenClaw.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div _ngcontent-sc327=""><p>Stargaze already has a proven track record in its utility for space safety. In late 2025, a Starlink satellite encountered a conjunction with a third-party satellite that was performing maneuvers, but whose operator was not sharing ephemeris. Until five hours before the conjunction, the close approach was anticipated to be ~9,000 meters—considered a safe miss-distance with zero probability of collision. With just five hours to go, the third-party satellite performed a maneuver which changed its trajectory and collapsed the anticipated miss distance to just ~60 meters. Stargaze quickly detected this maneuver and published an updated trajectory to the screening platform, generating new CDMs which were immediately distributed to relevant satellites. Ultimately, the Starlink satellite was able to react within an hour of the maneuver being detected, planning an avoidance maneuver to reduce collision risk back down to zero.</p><p>With so little time to react, this would not have been possible by relying on legacy radar systems or high-latency conjunction screening processes. If observations of the third-party satellite were less frequent, conjunction screening took longer, or the reaction required human approval, such an event might not have been successfully mitigated.</p><p>While Stargaze embodies a major improvement to the ability of any operator to fly safely, it is imperative for operators to frequently share ephemeris of their own fleets. This is particularly true for operators with maneuvering vehicles. While Stargaze can detect maneuvers more quickly than any other system in use today, the most definitive source of satellite trajectories should be provided by operators themselves, allowing deconfliction and minimizing collision avoidance maneuvers. Starlink ephemeris is updated and shared <a href="https://starlink.com/public-files/ephemerides/README.md">publicly every hour</a>, and all other operators should do the same. An appropriate analogy is commercial aviation: there are hundreds of thousands of flights of aircraft daily, but they are able to avoid collisions because they broadcast their location and flight plan to other aircraft. Similarly, spacecraft operators should follow this minimal standard of sharing their predicted trajectory.</p><p><b>By providing this ephemeris sharing and conjunction screening service free of charge, we hope to motivate operators to take similar steps towards ephemeris sharing and safe flight.</b></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The fact that oats have a beneficial effect on the metabolism is nothing new. German medic Carl von Noorden treated patients with diabetes with the cereal at the beginning of the 20th century – with remarkable success. “Today, effective medications are available to treat patients with diabetes,” explains Marie-Christine Simon, junior professor at the Institute of Nutritional and Food Science at the University of Bonn. “As a result, this method has been almost completely overlooked in recent decades.”</p>
<p>Although the test subjects in the current trial were not diabetic, they suffered from a metabolic syndrome associated with an increased risk of diabetes. The characteristics include excess body weight, high blood pressure, an elevated blood sugar level, and lipid metabolism disorders. “We wanted to know how a special oat-based diet affects patients,” explains Simon, who is also a member of the Transdisciplinary Research Areas “Life &amp; Health” and „Sustainable Futures“ at the University of Bonn.</p>
<p><strong>300 grams of oatmeal per day</strong></p>
<p>The participants were asked to exclusively eat oatmeal, which they had previously boiled in water, three times a day. They were only allowed to add some fruit or vegetables to their meals. A total of 32 women and men completed this oat-based diet. They ate 300 grams of oatmeal on each of the two days and only consumed around half of their normal calories. A control group was also put on a calorie-reduced diet, although this did not consist of oats.</p>
<p>Both groups benefited from the change in diet. However, the effect was much more pronounced for the participants who followed the oat-based diet. “The level of particularly harmful LDL cholesterol fell by 10 percent for them – that is a substantial reduction, although not entirely comparable to the effect of modern medications,” stresses Simon. “They also lost two kilos in weight on average and their blood pressure fell slightly.”</p>
<p>The effect on LDL cholesterol, in particular, is likely to be relevant to health. If the blood contains too much of this, it is deposited in the vessel walls. These deposits, known as plaques, narrow the blood vessels. In addition, the deposits can rupture, for instance due to an increase in blood pressure following physical exertion, anger, or stress. As a result, a blood clot can form at the affected site, completely blocking the blood vessel. Alternatively, parts of the plaque can be washed away by the blood and cause a heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p><strong>Oats promote the growth of “healthy” intestinal bacteria</strong></p>
<p>But how does oatmeal exert its beneficial effect? “We were able to identify that the consumption of oatmeal increased the number of certain bacteria in the gut,” explains Simon’s colleague Linda Klümpen, the lead author of the trial. The microbiome has increasingly been the focus of research in recent decades. After all, it is now known that intestinal bacteria play a decisive role in metabolizing food. They also release the metabolic by-products that they create into their environment. They supply, among other things, the cells of the gut with energy, enabling them to better perform their tasks.</p>
<p>In addition, the microbes send some of their products around the body in the blood stream, where they can have various effects. “For instance, we were able to show that intestinal bacteria produce phenolic compounds by breaking down the oats,” says Klümpen. “It has already been shown in animal studies that one of them, ferulic acid, has a positive effect on the cholesterol metabolism. This also appears to be the case for some of the other bacterial metabolic products.” At the same time, other microorganisms “dispose of” the amino acid histidine. The body otherwise turns this into a molecule that is suspected of promoting insulin resistance. This insensitivity to insulin is a key feature of diabetes mellitus.</p>
<p><strong>A large amount of oats for two days better than a small amount for six weeks</strong></p>
<p>The positive effects of the oat-based diet tended to still be evident six weeks later. “A short-term oat-based diet at regular intervals could be a well-tolerated way to keep the cholesterol level within the normal range and prevent diabetes,” says Junior Professor Simon. However, in the current study, the cereal above all exerted its effect at a high concentration and in conjunction with a calorie reduction: A six-week diet, in which the participants consumed 80 grams of oats per day, without any other restrictions, achieved small effects. “As a next step, it can now be clarified whether an intensive oat-based diet repeated every six weeks actually has a permanently preventative effect,” continues Simon.</p>
<p><strong>Test method:</strong></p>
<p>A total of 68 participants took part in the trial. For the two-day short-term oat-based diet, all 17 participants on the oat-based diet and 15 participants on the control diet successfully completed the study phase. Two participants in the control group withdrew for personal reasons. For the six-week long-term oat-based intervention, 17 participants in the study group and the same number in the control group took part until the end. The sample size of 17 participants per group was calculated by the researchers on the basis of data from an earlier interventional trial.</p>
<p>Both the two-day intensive diet and the six-week trial with a moderate dose of oats were randomized controlled trials. In these “RCTs,” the test subjects are divided into two groups at random (i.e. randomized). One of them receives the potential active ingredient – in this case the oats –, but the other (the control group) does not. Ideally, the test subjects are “blind”: They do not know to which group they belong. This rules out any placebo effects.</p>
<p>In nutritional experiments, blinding is often not possible – those involved ultimately generally know what they are eating. This was also the case in these studies. However, the evaluation of the blood and stool samples was indeed “blind”: The researchers in charge of this were not informed whether the material had been taken from members of the test group or the control group. The same also applied to the blood pressure and weight measurements. This ruled out the possibility of the scientists’ expectations falsifying the results.</p>
<p>Blood and stool samples were taken before the participants made any changes to their diet. Their blood pressure, weight, height, waist size, and body fat were also measured. A second examination took place immediately after the two-day oat-based diet, followed by three others after two, four, and six weeks. The same analysis were conducted on these four visits as during the initial examination and further blood and stool samples were collected. The researchers took the same approach during the second nutritional study, in which the subjects consumed 80 grams of oatmeal a day for six weeks.</p>
<p>The blood samples were examined in the lab for their LDL cholesterol content, among other things. The researchers also measured the concentration of a key molecule, dihydroferulic acid. This phenolic compound is presumably formed by certain intestinal bacteria, which are known to have a health-promoting effect.</p>
<p>By examining the stool samples, the researchers were able to confirm this hypothesis. They isolated what is known as 16S RNA from the samples. This is a molecule that exclusively occurs in bacteria, but differs somewhat between different species. A 16S RNA molecule can thus be used to identify the bacterium from which it originates, just like a fingerprint. The researchers also analyzed which metabolic products were present in the stool.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>What if your car worked like so many apps? You’re driving somewhere important…maybe running a little bit late. A few minutes into the drive, your car pulls over to the side of the road and asks:</p>



<p><em>“How are you enjoying your drive so far?”</em></p>



<p>Annoyed by the interruption, and even more behind schedule, you dismiss the prompt and merge back into traffic.</p>



<p>A minute later it does it again.</p>



<p><em>“Did you know I have a new feature? Tap here to learn more.”</em></p>



<p>It blocks your speedometer with an overlay tutorial about the turn signal. It highlights the wiper controls and refuses to go away until you demonstrate mastery.</p>



<p>Ridiculous, of course.</p>



<p>And yet, this is how a lot of modern software behaves. Not because it’s broken, but because we’ve normalized an interruption model that would be unacceptable almost anywhere else.</p>



<p>I’ve started to think of this as <strong>backseat software</strong>: the slow shift from software as a tool you operate to software as a channel that operates on you. Once a product learns it can talk back, it’s remarkably hard to keep it quiet.</p>



<p>This post is about how we got here. Not overnight, but slowly. One reasonable step at a time.</p>



<h2>Software Came on Disks</h2>



<p>There was a time when software shipped on physical media: floppy disks, CD-ROMs, sometimes even with a spiral-bound manual.</p>



<p>Software felt like a product back then. You bought it, installed it, and used it. If you upgraded, it was because you chose to. The software didn’t constantly change underneath you, and it didn’t have the opportunity to ask for your attention beyond whatever UI the developers shipped on day one.</p>



<p>That era had real downsides. If you shipped a serious bug, you lived with it until the next release, which could be weeks or months away. If security issues were discovered, your options ranged from “mail a patch” to “good luck.” In hindsight, it’s amazing we survived!</p>



<p>But something else was true too. When you were using the software, you were alone with it.</p>



<p>As a software developer, if something was wrong, you found out because users told you. Sometimes loudly. Sometimes angrily. Often on message forums or during support calls.</p>



<p>Feedback was slower and scarcer, but it was real. It was also “expensive” in the way that matters. You had to earn it, listen to it, and interpret it.</p>



<h2>Always Online</h2>



<p>Then the internet arrived, and for a while it was almost entirely upside.</p>



<p>Software could finally be updated after it shipped. Bugs could be fixed. Security holes could be closed. Documentation got easier. Support got easier. The idea of “ship it and hope for the best” started to fade.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Update">Microsoft’s update infrastructure</a> is a good example of the era. Updates moved from “go download this” toward automation over time, and by the early 2000s the industry was normalizing the idea that your machine could check for and apply updates regularly.</p>



<p>This was a genuine leap forward in quality and safety. If you’ve ever been on the receiving end of a serious bug report, you know how valuable it is to fix something <em>now</em> rather than in the next boxed release.</p>



<p>So far, so good.</p>



<h2>The Back Channel</h2>



<p>Once software could reliably connect to the internet, it no longer just received instructions. It could talk back to the company that made it.</p>



<p>At first, this too was mostly good. Crash reports made it easier to fix real problems, update checks were convenient, and license activation reduced some kinds of piracy. Teams could finally see patterns in failure modes instead of guessing.</p>



<p>Developers like me love this kind of feedback loop, and for good reason. A tool that improves over time is better than one that doesn’t.</p>



<p>But that back channel didn’t stay limited to “this crashed” and “there’s an update.” It expanded, quietly, because once you can send <em>some</em> data home, the next question arrives right on schedule:</p>



<p><em>“Since we’re already connected…what else can we learn?”</em></p>



<h2>Everything Gets Measured</h2>



<p>Once software could send data home, the next natural thought was:</p>



<p><em>“Can we understand how people actually use this?”</em></p>



<p>Again, that’s not an evil thought. In fact, it’s useful! Before analytics, if you wanted to understand user behavior, you had to ask people, watch them, or infer patterns from support tickets. That requires time, empathy, and effort.</p>



<p>Suddenly, you didn’t have to guess anymore.</p>



<p>Web analytics going mainstream is one of those quiet accelerants. <a href="https://urchin.biz/urchin-software-corp-89a1f5292999">Google’s acquisition of Urchin in 2005</a>, and the rise of Google Analytics shortly after, helped normalize the idea that instrumentation and dashboards were simply part of building software.</p>



<p>Instead of arguing in a meeting about which features mattered most, you could look at usage data. Instead of guessing where people struggled, you could see drop-offs. Instead of relying on the loudest customer, you could get a broader view.</p>



<p><strong>But somewhere along the way, the center of gravity shifted.</strong></p>



<p>Usage data stopped being a tool for improving software and became a tool for optimizing behavior. The question quietly changed from:</p>



<p><em>“Is this good software?”</em></p>



<p>to:</p>



<p><em>“Does this increase engagement?”</em></p>



<p>And that’s when the vocabulary starts to creep in. DAU. MAU. Retention. Funnels. Stickiness. Cohorts. Conversion. Gamification. Oh my!</p>



<p>If you’ve worked inside a modern product organization, you’ve heard these words so often they start to feel unavoidable.</p>



<h2>Metrics Can Be Correct and Still Be Wrong</h2>



<p>One of the most dangerous things about analytics is that they feel objective. A chart is a chart. A number is a number. They have the aesthetic of truth.</p>



<p>I’ve always liked this quote by William Bruce Cameron (<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/26/everything-counts-einstein/">often misattributed to Albert Einstein</a>)<em>:</em><em></em></p>



<p><em>“Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.”</em></p>



<p>Metrics don’t measure reality. They measure what your product currently makes easy.</p>



<p>There’s a well-known warning about this, often summarized as: <em>when a measure becomes a target, it stops being a good measure</em>. It’s commonly referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s Law</a>, and the broader point shows up in multiple fields, because it keeps happening to humans in systems with incentives.</p>



<p>When I was at Microsoft, a team wanted to remove a feature because “the analytics show that nobody uses it.” If you looked at the UI, though, that feature had been moved deeper and deeper over time:</p>



<ul>
<li>it used to be easy to find</li>



<li>then it moved into a menu</li>



<li>then into a submenu</li>



<li>then into a settings panel</li>



<li>then behind an “advanced” section</li>



<li>then it was basically invisible</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course nobody used it!</p>



<p>The analytics didn’t prove the feature was unwanted. The analytics proved that we buried it.</p>



<p>Even worse, once a metric becomes a target, people get promoted for moving it. That doesn’t require anyone to be malicious. It just requires incentives and a dashboard.</p>



<h2>Experimenting in Production</h2>



<p>Measuring behavior changes what feels possible:</p>



<p><em>“What if we try two versions to see which one performs better?”</em></p>



<p>This is where A/B testing enters the story.</p>



<p>On paper, it’s an engineering triumph! Instead of arguing about opinions, you can test ideas. Instead of debating copy or layout in a meeting, you can ship both and let real-world behavior decide.</p>



<p>But A/B testing quietly changes the role of the product team. You’re no longer just building a tool and observing how it’s used. You’re now running experiments on people…adjusting wording, placement, timing, friction, and flow to see what moves the metric.</p>



<p>At that point, the product stops being a finished artifact and starts behaving like a laboratory. Every screen becomes provisional, and every interaction becomes a hypothesis. Once that mindset takes hold, it’s very hard not to optimize for what moves fastest, even if it moves the wrong thing.</p>



<p>There’s a quieter consequence here that doesn’t get talked about much. When experimentation becomes the primary decision-making tool, a strong product vision becomes optional.</p>



<p>Not because anyone argues against <em>vision</em>, but because you don’t strictly need it anymore, and because backing a chart is safer than backing an opinion. Metrics have numbers and experiments have winners. If a decision goes wrong, you can always point to the data and say, “we followed the evidence.”</p>



<p>Over time, this can change the role of a product team where judgment slowly gives way to iteration, and taste gives way to performance. The product still evolves, but it does so without a clear sense of direction…only a sense of momentum.</p>



<h2>Guidance Everywhere</h2>



<p>Once experimentation becomes the default way decisions get made, changing behavior stops being theoretical and starts being procedural.</p>



<p>At that point, nudges aren’t a new idea. They’re the obvious next move. It usually starts reasonably:</p>



<p><em>“We shipped a feature. Users might not notice it.”</em></p>



<p>Fair.</p>



<p>So you add a little callout. Then a tooltip. Then an onboarding tour. Then a “What’s New” screen. Then a little survey. Then another survey, because you didn’t get enough responses the first time. By the time you’re done dismissing everything, the tool has already taken more time than the task itself.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever read about <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300262285/nudge/">“choice architecture” and nudging</a>, this will feel familiar. The modern language for it was popularized in the late 2000s, and the core idea is simple: how choices are presented changes what people do, even if nothing is technically forced.</p>



<p>Then product teams go one step further. Instead of just shaping choices, you can shape <em>timing</em>. Prompts start showing up in the middle of workflows because that’s when the user is “most engaged.”</p>



<p>The industry also has a whole discipline around persuasive design and how to move someone from intention to action with prompts, friction removal, and well-timed triggers. <a href="https://www.demenzemedicinagenerale.net/images/mens-sana/Captology_Fogg_Behavior_Model.pdf">B.J. Fogg’s behavior model</a> is one of the more cited frameworks in this space.</p>



<p>Some nudges are genuinely helpful. But the same machinery that helps you discover a feature can also be used to push you into something you didn’t come here to do. And once the machinery exists, it gets reused.</p>



<p>It’s also why coming back to an app after you’ve been away for as little as a week can feel like a game of Whac-A-Mole. Not because you forgot how to use the tool, but because the tool has been busy while you were gone. There’s new tips, new tours, new “what’s new” overlays, new announcements, new prompts that all want a click before you’re allowed to do the thing you actually opened it for.</p>



<h2>Push Notifications</h2>



<p>Then the smartphone era arrived and made interruption cheaper. Once you can send push notifications, you no longer have to wait for the user to open the tool. You can tap them on the shoulder whenever you want.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Push_Notification_service">Apple’s push notification service</a> arrived with iOS 3.0 in 2009, and it’s hard to overstate what a shift this was for the “who initiates the interaction?” question.</p>



<p>Some of this is legitimate and genuinely helpful:</p>



<ul>
<li>messages you asked for</li>



<li>alerts you configured</li>



<li>reminders you chose</li>
</ul>



<p>But we all know where it went:</p>



<ul>
<li>“We miss you.”</li>



<li>“You haven’t finished setup.”</li>



<li>“You haven’t tried this feature.”</li>



<li>“Come back and see what’s new.”</li>
</ul>



<p>All framed as helpful. All measured in engagement. And just like that, the tool starts acting less like a tool and more like a stalker.</p>



<h2>In Defense</h2>



<p>To be fair, not every prompt is evil, and not every notification is marketing.</p>



<p>Some software is genuinely complicated, and a little guidance prevents real mistakes. Some categories are basically <em>made of</em> alerts: messaging, security, banking, calendars, delivery tracking, anything where timing actually matters.</p>



<p>Telemetry exists because some problems can’t be found any other way. It’s often the only method that enables teams to find the weird crashes that happen on one driver version, one device model, or one edge case you’ll never reproduce in-house.</p>



<p>Even the “feature tour” has a defensible origin story. Users ask for improvements, teams ship them, and then users complain they didn’t know the improvements existed. In other words, the same people who hate popups also punish you when you make changes silently. If you’ve ever shipped a big UI redesign, you already know this.</p>



<p>So the problem isn’t that software <em>ever</em> teaches, asks, or informs. The problem is that once a company builds the machinery to do it, that machinery becomes cheap to reuse, and the incentives gradually pull it away from “help the user succeed” toward “move the metric.”</p>



<p>What starts as an occasional heads-up becomes a permanent layer of UI exhaust. What starts as support becomes a funnel. What starts as a reminder becomes a habit-forming system.</p>



<p>That’s the drift I’m talking about. Not guidance existing at all, but guidance becoming the default posture of the tool…always talking, always nudging, always taking the first turn in the conversation.</p>



<p>And once the tool decides it should initiate the interaction, the rest of the story is mostly mechanics.</p>



<h2>Even the Builders Hate It</h2>



<p>One of the most bizarre contradictions in modern software is that the people building these engagement systems don’t like them either!</p>



<p>Ask anyone who works on onboarding popups, feature tours, lifecycle messaging, or in-app announcements how they feel when an app interrupts them mid-flow to announce something they didn’t ask for. The answer is almost always the same.</p>



<p>They hate it! Or at least they’re annoyed.</p>



<p>Find me the telemarketer who likes being called during their own dinner. The job exists because it works <em>enough</em> in aggregate, not because anyone enjoys being on either end of it.</p>



<p>So why does it keep happening? Because inside companies, the incentives are clear and the measurements are easy. You can measure clicks and track whether they led to a “completion.” You can measure whether a nudge led to the next step in the funnel.</p>



<p>You cannot easily measure the resentment. Or the rage clicks when they smash a button to dismiss another “did you know” pop-up. You cannot easily chart the moment a user thinks, “I used to like this product, and now it feels needy.” You cannot easily quantify the slow erosion of trust.</p>



<p>There’s an older framing for this that I like: <em>in an information-rich world, attention becomes the scarce resource</em>. <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/design/1971-simon.pdf">Herbert Simon wrote about this dynamic in 1971</a>, long before push notifications, app stores, or social media feeds.</p>



<p>If your business runs on attention, and attention is scarce, then the pressure to “capture” it becomes constant.</p>



<h2>Tools Are Supposed to Get Out of the Way</h2>



<p>As the marketing adage goes:</p>



<p><em>People don’t want a drill. They want a hole in the wall.</em></p>



<p>The drill is just the tool. The outcome is the job. Nobody wakes up and says, “I’d like to buy a new drill today!” Well, except drill enthusiasts, I suppose. Likewise, nobody wakes up and says, “I’d like to buy a new app today!” In fact, your app is in the way of their objective.</p>



<p>I could argue that nobody wants the hole either.</p>



<p>What they really want is what comes <em>after</em> the hole. They want to hang photos of family and friends, souvenirs from trips, and artwork that makes a room feel like home. The drill and the hole are both just steps along the way.</p>



<p>That distance matters. The further a tool is from the real human outcome, the more invisible it should be. The drill doesn’t ask how you’re enjoying your experience drilling. It doesn’t upsell you on premium hole-making. It exists to disappear the moment it’s done its job.</p>



<p>This is a useful way to think about software. Most users don’t want “software.” They want the outcome:</p>



<ul>
<li>write the document</li>



<li>edit the photo</li>



<li>pay the invoice</li>



<li>file the taxes</li>



<li>ship the code</li>



<li>communicate with the team</li>
</ul>



<p>Great tools get out of the way so the user can accomplish their goal.</p>



<p>Your favorite products feel like they’re not there. You open them, do the thing you came to do, and close them again without ever feeling managed, marketed to, or delayed.</p>



<p>Your least favorite products tend to do the opposite. You use them because you have to, not because you want to.</p>



<h2>Everything Gets “Smart”</h2>



<p>This pattern is spreading because “smart” is spreading. Smart TVs. Smart speakers. Smart thermostats. Smart appliances. Anything that joins your Wi-Fi can:</p>



<ul>
<li>update itself (often good)</li>



<li>send diagnostics (often good)</li>



<li>collect usage data (sometimes defensible)</li>



<li>interrupt you (almost always annoying)</li>



<li>market to you (almost never what you bought it for)</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s the same story as software, just with plastic and a power cord.</p>



<p>One more backchannel: some “smart” TVs use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_content_recognition">Automatic Content Recognition</a> (ACR) to identify what’s on the screen and turn that into data. It’s basically a pixel-sampled fingerprint of anything that shows up on your screen whether streamed, broadcast, or just played back locally.</p>



<p>If you want a more academic version of how “data collection leads to prediction which leads to intervention” becomes a business model, this is adjacent to what <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/03/harvard-professor-says-surveillance-capitalism-is-undermining-democracy/">Shoshana Zuboff describes as surveillance capitalism</a>. It’s not just observing behavior, but intervening to shape it.</p>



<h2>How We Got Here</h2>



<p>None of these events ruined software by themselves. They just made the next step easier.</p>



<ul>
<li>1990s: consumer internet connectivity becomes mainstream, and “online” stops being a special mode.</li>



<li>1996–1997: PointCast popularizes <a href="https://www.wired.com/1997/03/ff-push/">“push” to the desktop</a> (including ads): software starts initiating the interaction.</li>



<li>1997: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2014/08/15/the-man-who-invented-pop-up-ads-says-im-sorry/">pop-up ads</a> arrive and interruption becomes a business model.</li>



<li>1997: <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/1996/11/19/microsoft-office-97-released-to-manufacturing/">Office 97 ships</a> with “Clippy” the Office Assistant, the friendly ancestor of in-app nudges.</li>



<li>2000: “automatic updates” becomes a normal expectation for consumer operating systems.</li>



<li>2005: <a href="https://googlepress.blogspot.com/2005/03/google-agrees-to-acquire-urchin_28.html">Urchin</a> → Google Analytics: instrumentation and dashboards go mainstream.</li>



<li>July 10, 2008: <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2008/07/10iPhone-3G-on-Sale-Tomorrow/">the App Store launches</a> and app distribution becomes frictionless.</li>



<li>June 17, 2009: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Push_Notification_service">push notifications</a> arrive at scale on iOS (even if they weren’t first): the app no longer has to wait for you to open it.</li>



<li>Nov 4, 2009: Apple announces <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2009/11/04Apple-Announces-Over-100-000-Apps-Now-Available-on-the-App-Store/">2 billion push notifications</a> already delivered, early proof that “tap on the shoulder” scales.</li>



<li>2010s: “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523007965">growth hacking</a>” becomes a discipline; nudges, tours, overlays, and lifecycle messaging become standard product surface area.</li>



<li>By 2011, Apple’s review rules explicitly forbade using push for “advertising, promotions, or direct marketing.”</li>



<li>Mar 4, 2020: Apple changes course and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21165087/ios-apple-push-notification-advertising-marketing-now-allowed-app-store">allows marketing push</a>, but only with explicit opt-in.</li>



<li>2020s: “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/">enshittification</a>” becomes a word people recognize because enough people feel the pattern.</li>
</ul>



<p>People use “enshittification” to describe platform decay. What I’m describing here is one of the mechanisms that makes that decay feel personal. It’s the constant conversion of your attention into a <a href="https://www.kpi.org/kpi-basics/">KPI</a>.</p>



<h2>Designing for Quiet</h2>



<p>I don’t want to go back to floppy disks. I like fast updates. I like security patches. I like sync. I like crash reports when they help fix real issues.</p>



<p>What I want is for “phone home” to be treated like a privileged capability, not an assumed right. In other domains, we treat privileged capabilities with care. We put them behind intentional choices. We build guardrails. And we treat abuse as a bug, not a growth opportunity.</p>



<p>Here are a few practical ways out. And yes, we’ve heard many of these before.</p>



<h3>1) Make interruptions opt-in, and make opt-out permanent</h3>



<p>If you want to announce a feature, fine. Put it somewhere predictable.</p>



<p>If you want to educate, fine. Let me ask for help.</p>



<p>If you want to survey me, fine. Ask at a sensible moment and accept “no” as a real answer.</p>



<p>Most importantly, if I turn something off, it should stay off! A tool should not require me to keep saying “not now.” Or conveniently “forget” my choices in its next update.</p>



<h3>2) Separate product health telemetry from growth telemetry</h3>



<p>Crash reports, performance metrics, and error logs are about stability.</p>



<p>Engagement nudges are about behavior.</p>



<p>When those get mixed together, the growth incentives win, because they produce the cleanest charts and the easiest wins. If you can’t draw a clear line between “this helps us fix bugs” and “this helps us juice numbers,” the product will drift toward the numbers.</p>



<h3>3) Use analytics as a flashlight, not a steering wheel</h3>



<p>Analytics are useful for asking better questions. They are not answers by themselves. Before removing a feature because “nobody uses it,” ask:</p>



<ul>
<li>Is it discoverable?</li>



<li>Did we move it?</li>



<li>Did we rename it?</li>



<li>Is it used rarely because it solves rare but important problems?</li>



<li>Is it used by a small set of power users who keep the whole system running?</li>

<p>Then talk to humans. Analytics can reduce guessing, but it can also create false certainty.</p>



<h3>4) Optimize for trust, not just return visits</h3>



<p>Short-term engagement can be increased by annoyance. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311975.2024.2361321">Long-term loyalty is harder and more valuable</a>.</p>



<p>The best products I use don’t constantly remind me to use them. They quietly do their job so well that I come back when I need them. That’s what tools are supposed to do.</p>



<h3>5) Ship a real “quiet mode”</h3>



<p>Not “quiet except for what we care about.”</p>



<p><em>Quiet</em>.</p>



<p>No popups. No tours. No surveys. No “news.” No nudges.</p>



<p>If the product is genuinely valuable, quiet mode should improve retention, because it respects the user’s attention and intent.</p>



<p>Also, it’s a nice forcing function. If your product can’t stand on its own without constantly poking the user, that’s a signal. Maybe not the signal you want, but definitely a signal.</p>



<p>Software didn’t break all at once. It eroded slowly, one reasonable justification at a time.</p>



<p>Each step made sense in isolation, and each step could be defended. Together, they reshaped the priorities of an entire industry. Once software became measurable in this way, it became optimizable in this way. And optimization has a way of eating everything else.</p>



<p>Instead, let’s make software that respects your attention, does its job well, and lets you get on with your life. That’s what good software used to feel like and what it could feel like again. Good software is a tool that you operate, not a channel that operates on you.</p>
