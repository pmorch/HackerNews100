        <p>The year is 2025. The internet in the shape that we‚Äôve known it in the early 2000s is no longer there. Or, not quite in the shape that we‚Äôve seen it before. This is not just plain nostalgia talking - the vibrant ecosystem of blogs, feeds, personal sites, and forums has been usurped by a few mega-concentrated players.</p>
<p>Want to find a vibrant community around a very niche subject? It‚Äôs <em>probably</em> on Reddit. Or you know what - it could be Discord. Or both. Some still operate the occasional VBulletin on phpBB board, but that‚Äôs the minority. Want to buy or sell something? Your best bet is checking Facebook‚Äôs Marketplace (and of course, coordinate the purchase through Facebook‚Äôs Messenger, not email or any other means). Want to watch videos from some of your favorite makers? YouTube or bust. Anything outside of the ecosystem of these conglomerates is bound to naturally gain less visibility and it will be <em>insanely</em> less discoverable to large swaths of the population.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve reached a point where, for quite a few folks, ‚Äúthe internet‚Äù is synonymous with ‚ÄúFacebook, Instagram, and Discord,‚Äù and if it‚Äôs not there, it might as well not exist. This shift introduces a range of problems, that we‚Äôll talk about a bit more in this post.</p>
<p>I should also caveat the post with this disclaimer - the target audience here is people <strong>proficient with technology</strong>. For the <em>vast majority of the population</em> the <a href="#what-can-we-do">suggestions</a> I am going to be discussing are untenable in the current technological landscape, and that‚Äôs OK. My job is not to get <em>every single person to build their content outside the popular networks</em> but rather encourage those that were on the fence and able to make the jump into <strong>owning their own internet property</strong> rather than <strong>rent the space from someone who is not invested in their success</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="here-we-are">Here we are <span><a href="#here-we-are" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2>
<p>Now, this blog post‚Äôs intent is not to get you to stop using all ‚ÄúBigCo‚Äù services or convince you that the products made by these companies are <em>universally</em> evil or bad. They‚Äôre not. Being able to <em>reliably</em> watch videos on any platform or browser is great. I use YouTube and I publish quite a few videos there. I also use Reddit to connect with folks that enjoy Halo because there is <em>no other place</em> where that community hangs out. There are things that are simply done better when there is proper funding and a full-time staff working every day to maintain the infrastructure at scale, especially when talking about non-niche domains. That means that <em>by default</em> most people will not try to do this themselves. And they shouldn‚Äôt.</p>
<p>Running infrastructure for yourself is hard. Running infrastructure for <em>others</em> is <strong>exponentially</strong> harder. As any forum moderator or administrator can attest, the sheer volume of spam, abuse, and just generally trash behavior can wear down even the most seasoned veterans of the <code>.com</code> era. And that‚Äôs if we‚Äôre talking about communities that host <em>tens of thousands</em> of users. Scale that to a few million and there won‚Äôt be enough hours in the day to either keep the servers running (stuff is <em>costly</em> too) or to monitor the content for anything potentially harmful or inappropriate.</p>
<p>For anyone that wants to start a community, it‚Äôs a no-brainer that they should probably start somewhere where they can ‚Äúoutsource‚Äù the hard things, like moderation and infrastructure, to someone who is an expert and has built-in mechanisms to handle everything in-house. Especially when the funds for this are at or around zero dollars. That‚Äôs a totally reasonable stance to take, and I absolutely get the rationale there.</p>
<p>Not only that, but a lot of the existing ecosystems rest on the shoulders of network effects. Once everyone you care about is on Reddit, are you really going to be the only one <em>not</em> on Reddit and try to bootstrap your own little corner for a specific community? Probably not, and attracting people there would be much harder. Reddit is the one-stop-shop - I can go there for woodworking advice, but I can also chat in local communities, or communities around collecting stamps, with the same account and within the same interface. Are you really going to post photos of your fridge that you want to sell on your blog and hope that in a year someone discovers it through a Google search? Of course not - you will go to Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist and get it sold within a few days.</p>
<p>You, the user, are going to go where most people are, because you‚Äôre <strong>optimizing for solving your problems</strong>, such as finding like-minded individuals or selling the fridge quickly and getting it out of your garage to make room for a table saw. Most people are this way - they don‚Äôt care who or how maintains or runs a community or network as long as that place solves the problems they set out to solve. When that goal overlaps with the company‚Äôs desire to make money, you end up in somewhat of a <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/what-is-the-habitable-zone-or-goldilocks-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">goldilocks zone</a>, but that‚Äôs <em>typically</em> a short-lived experience with modern services. More on that shortly.</p>
<p>Knowing all this doesn‚Äôt mean that we should automatically absolve these companies from one very insidious thing that creeps up on us over time - <strong>being locked into walled gardens</strong>. If the last decade has shown us anything, it‚Äôs that a lot of these ecosystems are poorly suited to keep the <em>interest of the user</em> in mind for the long run. It all boils down to the fact that major platforms over time are usually interested in:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Constant growth (both monetary and engagement), at all costs</strong>. Ads are, quite literally, everywhere. YouTube is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1gct9ar/youtube_now_blocks_ublock_origin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fighting tooth and nail</a> (the irony of linking to Reddit is not lost on me) to prevent you, the user, from being able to block ads. AI-generated slop is going to make its way into <a href="https://www.404media.co/youtube-enhances-comment-section-with-ai-generated-nonsense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comments</a> and descriptions - arguably, things that nobody really asked for, but you‚Äôre going to get them anyway. Facebook and Instagram will soon have ‚Äú<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/meta-ai-users-facebook-instagram-1235221430/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI users</a>‚Äù (whatever shape that‚Äôs going to take) to help ‚Äúboost engagement.‚Äù The platforms are not interested in helping you, the customer, in easier and more robust communication with your family and friends. They want you to ‚Äúengage‚Äù and drive the ad dollar revenue up.</li>
<li><strong>Keeping you within their walls and give you few chances to leave</strong>. Twitter doesn‚Äôt care about the fact that you poured your heart and soul in that one blog post and wanted to share it with your community. You post a link - <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/10/03/musk-x-links-long-form" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you get downranked</a>. Because that will cause people to <em>actually leave Twitter</em> to read your thinking, and that means they won‚Äôt be able to scroll through an ad-ridden feed. You ever wonder why Instagram doesn‚Äôt really let you post links? Yeah.</li>
<li><strong>Maximizing your attention and time <em>within</em> the ecosystem</strong>. <a href="https://newslit.org/tips-tools/news-lit-tip-engagement-bait/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Engagement bait</a> is everywhere, and the more engagement - the better! Why bubble up someone‚Äôs <em>real</em> thoughts and work when instead you can <a href="https://www.404media.co/where-facebooks-ai-slop-comes-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">push up more AI slop</a> that will get people angry, upset, and more likely to <em>engage</em> on your platform (the AI slop problem will get worse, but don‚Äôt worry, it will be ‚Äú<a href="https://www.404media.co/zuckerberg-the-ai-slop-will-continue-until-morale-improves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a whole new category of content</a>‚Äù)?</li>
<li><strong>Hoovering up data about you</strong>. You can‚Äôt even browse a community without an account. Want to see someone‚Äôs photo feed on Instagram? Better be ready to sign up, or only see the latest few photos, with a persistent nag screen telling you to log in. Want to browse Facebook Marketplace for that homelab gear you‚Äôve been looking for? Tough luck, you need a Facebook account to see listings, even if you‚Äôre not going to buy anything (contrast that to Craigslist). Want to see what a particular hobby community is chatting about? Discord doesn‚Äôt allow anonymous browsing, so once again - you need to create an account. Once you log in, there is now clear attribution of everything you do to an account. uBlock Origin and <a href="https://den.dev/blog/pihole/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pi-hole</a> can do a good job at blocking quite a few privacy-invading things, but they do nothing to prevent server-side telemetry collection that tracks your behavior on every page within the platform. Facebook knows exactly how long you spent browsing Marketplace before making a purchase, and in which area you live based on your history. Reddit can tell what you‚Äôre interested in based on the communities you browse and tailor ads based on that. Your profile is being built, and then sold (or ‚Äúshared‚Äù) to a myriad of unscrupulous data brokers.</li>
<li><strong>Exploiting user-generated content</strong>. For example, when you upload an image to Instagram, you‚Äôre not transferring ownership rights to your creation to Meta, but you do give them <a href="https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a license to use the content</a> - a ‚Äú<em>non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content.</em>‚Äù Neat! Your art might end up in an ad you did not consent to, but you still retain the copyright. Or they might train their AI on it, who knows.</li>
</ol>
<p>The more walled gardens grow, the more the interest of the user fades, replaced by a strong drive for monetization and growth. So, why are these companies not keeping the interest of the user in mind, though, if the users are the ones <em>actually</em> building the communities? If it wouldn‚Äôt be for the users on those platforms wouldn‚Äôt those platforms disappear overnight, a fate that MySpace and Digg know a bit to well? Well, in the words of the modern philosopher <a href="https://youtu.be/zR7LOtMix9w?t=159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dave Chappelle</a>:</p>

<p>Almost with no exceptions, you, the user, are unfortunately the product for social networks of any kind. And that‚Äôs not necessarily malice, but just a core design principle of walled gardens, applied generously as they grow. Walled gardens often start with good intentions, but once a critical mass of users settles, there is a strong desire to ensure that those users stick around <em>and</em> can produce a return on investment - those hosting bills aren‚Äôt going to pay themselves. That means that a lot of anti-user patterns will slowly start to emerge (not all at once, though), limiting the control over the experience, and by proxy, the benefits to its inhabitants. Say, at first posts with links will be deprioritized. Then, instead of showing your content in a chronological feed for your followers, your content will be shown at the mercy of a black box algorithm. Then, ‚Äúpremium‚Äù users will get boosted while non-paying users will be left to linger somewhere at the bottom of the discoverability stack. Before you know it, the oh-so-kind ecosystem that gave you an audience starts being hostile to you unless you pony up or play to the algorithm‚Äôs fiddle ("<em>Hey, how about making your thumbnails a bit more clickbait-y to drive some engagement?</em>").</p>
<p>At that point, the meta-goal is to <em>serve the company</em>, not <em>you</em>. You‚Äôre already hooked, and can‚Äôt move away without losing access to the network you built over the years. That‚Äôs a losing proposition for most people. Even looking at recent examples such as the massive exodus to Bluesky from Twitter required some <em>extremely strong</em> headwinds to emerge for that to happen, and it‚Äôs still unclear how permanent this change will be.</p>
<p>Jeff Atwood had a <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/avoiding-walled-gardens-on-the-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">good post</a> about this phenomenon all the way back in 2007. Who knew that little would change for close to two decades. And as the situation required, <a href="https://pluralistic.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cory Doctorow</a> has astutely coined the term that captures what is happening - ‚Äú<em>enshittification</em>.‚Äù A product whose success is predicated on its ability to <em>constantly</em> grow may start with somewhat altruistic aspirations, but it inevitably will reach a point where the owners will need to make money off of its users, and that‚Äôs when the service will start turning the screws for the worse, with no way to escape without adverse effects. We‚Äôre at that point with basically every ecosystem I mentioned above.</p>
<p>We are tenants with landlords who want to make sure that we can‚Äôt leave the building or go hang out with friends elsewhere, all while showing us how happy we should be with the limitations imposed on us.</p>
<h2 id="advice-that-is-not-helpful">Advice that is not helpful <span><a href="#advice-that-is-not-helpful" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2>
<p>A <em>huge</em> part of the problem here is that, even in my framing, <strong>I am thinking like a person that works in tech</strong> and enjoys dabbling with technology. I host my blog. I self-host my data. I use a static site generator instead of a vanilla Wix or WordPress instance. I know my way around the terminal and can do a <code>npm run</code> to see what my site looks like before I push it to production. But I am not like most people. Not because I am special, but because most people <em>literally couldn‚Äôt care less</em> about the infrastructure, tools, privacy implications, or the fact that their content is not visible without an account.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why I find advice like this useless:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Well of course it‚Äôs better to host your own blog! Also, while you‚Äôre at it, put your Mastodon server in a DigitalOcean droplet, throw some Cloudflare CDN in front of it, run your own Raspberry Pi to monitor uptime, and you‚Äôre golden! Oh, and don‚Äôt forget to also make sure to log into the droplet every once in a while to update the container, do an occasional database migration, and ensure that you check the logs for intrusions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is about as helpful as someone recommending switching to Linux to someone who wants to improve their privacy posture (skip <code>/r/privacy</code> for your own sanity, by the way). Ask me why I used this analogy. You missed the forest for the trees.</p>
<p>No person that doesn‚Äôt work in tech (and <em>many</em> people that do) wants to deal with any of this. For most of us, we have a million other things we‚Äôd rather do in our life than stand up our own infrastructure to host a blog that gets 50 visits a month from our friends or family, or maintain a Mastodon server that you get charged for monthly to post random thoughts to a few hundred followers. It‚Äôs easier to just publish that as a long-form LinkedIn post. It‚Äôs easier to share the video on YouTube and not host it yourself on some web page and pay for the bandwidth of a multi-gigabyte MP4 file.</p>
<p>Most people are <strong>perfectly content</strong> with everything living inside their Facebook account because it‚Äôs <em>convenient</em> and <em>their family and friends are already there</em>. Telling everyone to learn how <code>git</code> and GitHub Pages work to host their blog is not an effective way to drive change. But that‚Äôs also not the point. As I mentioned earlier, the goal is to start with a small niche community of people who <em>are</em> comfortable with building their own digital corners.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-we-do">What can we do <span><a href="#what-can-we-do" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2>
<p>The point I am trying to drive home is that we shouldn‚Äôt <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2021/11/01/dont-build-your-castle-in-other-peoples-kingdoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">build our castle in someone else‚Äôs kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>Do not give full control of <em>your</em> content to the platforms that see you as a resource to be used to grow their own metrics. Here are a few rules that I set for myself, that I hope you also find helpful in making sure that you are a <strong>property owner</strong> on the internet rather than a mere renter in someone‚Äôs building. This is heavily inspired by the ‚Äú<a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2021/11/01/dont-build-your-castle-in-other-peoples-kingdoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don‚Äôt build your castle in other people‚Äôs kingdoms</a>‚Äù blog post by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriszukowski/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Zukowski</a>, with a few extensions that I
amended from my own experience.</p>
<p>The items below also assume that you‚Äôre OK spending a bit of money and time on establishing your <em>more durable</em> presence online. There are, of course, free options, but anything free usually comes with quite a few strings attached that can put you in the same position I argued against above.</p>
<h3 id="1-have-your-own-property-on-the-web">1. Have your own property on the web <span><a href="#1-have-your-own-property-on-the-web" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3>
<p>Buy a domain and host your own website. It really doesn‚Äôt matter what you use for either the domain purchase or the hosting, as long as it‚Äôs <em>your property</em>. You can start with any of the site builders, host your own blog engine, or even use a static site generator like me. But as long as you have your own stake in the ground, you‚Äôre off to a good start. You don‚Äôt even need to be super technically proficient for this - platforms like Squarespace simplify this process quite a bit. And this is just one of them.</p>
<p>The domain registrar and the website host are <em>entirely</em> transparent to your friends and customers. If at some point your host decides to do something silly, you can take your website and move it elsewhere. Domains can be moved to other registrars too. You get quite a bit of flexibility there. Compare it to having all your eggs in the Twitter basket - if a new owner decides to take it in a direction you don‚Äôt agree with, and everyone leaves for Bluesky, you can‚Äôt take your Twitter followers and move them over. You‚Äôll be forced to start from scratch.</p>
<p>In contrast, if at some point you want to change who hosts your site or which mail provider you use for your newsletter (thankfully emails are independent entities that can work on any platform), as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriszukowski/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris</a> put it in the <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2021/11/01/dont-build-your-castle-in-other-peoples-kingdoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aforementioned blog post</a>, your customers ‚Äú<em>[‚Ä¶] will still go to the same URL to get to your site, they will still receive your newsletter from your email address.</em>‚Äù</p>
<div>
  <p><img src="https://assets.den.dev/images/shared/stop.gif" alt="Mole out of the ground, thinking.">
  </p>
  <p>I am sure there are places where I should <strong>not</strong> host my content, no? What am I optimizing for here, exactly?</p>
</div>
<p>I would recommend avoiding any places where there is <em>content lock-in</em>. You want to optimize for <strong>future portability</strong>. That is, if you can‚Äôt easily export your full content history (e.g., blog posts) and move them somewhere else, don‚Äôt use that service. If your content is locked into a service, and at some point that service decides that you are no longer a wanted customer, all that effort you put into making it available to your customers can vanish on a moment‚Äôs notice. Prefer sites that allow you to publish in open formats, such as <a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost</a>.</p>
<p>If you are going to use a service where the content is stored in a proprietary format that you can‚Äôt easily access wholesale, always maintain your own copy and export the hosted content regularly. You should be able to recover it on a new site shall anything happen to your current site.</p>
<div>
  <p><img src="https://assets.den.dev/images/shared/thinking.gif" alt="Mole out of the ground, thinking.">
  </p>
  <p>What about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain">top-level domain (TLD)</a>? Are there any particular things I need to consider before registering my own domain? Should I seek out a <code>.com</code> or is <code>.xyz</code> OK to use as well?</p>
</div>
<p>Great reminder! Yes, pick a TLD with a <em>generally</em> positive reputation and future durability! You want to make sure that both your <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name-registrar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>registrar</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>registry</em></a> are entities that can be more-or-less trusted to not disappear overnight. Any of the traditional <code>.com</code>, <code>.net</code>, or <code>.org</code> are great. <code>.dev</code>, like this blog is using, is good too. Certain country-specific TLDs (called ccTLDs, for ‚Äúcountry code top-level domains‚Äù) are great as well, such as <code>.ca</code> for Canada (you need to be a Canadian permanent resident or citizen to register, though) or <code>.eu</code> for the European Union. TLDs such as <code>.xyz</code>, <code>.io</code>, or <code>.zip</code> (yes, it‚Äôs real, and it‚Äôs not spectacular) can be a bit more dicey due to things like association with spam content, dependence on <a href="https://thenewstack.io/what-is-the-future-of-the-io-domain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new political developments</a>, and just general mistrust. That‚Äôs not to say that you should <em>never</em> use them, but do prefer more established TLDs when possible.</p>
<p>As a best-practice, I would also <em>highly</em> recommend the separation of concerns in terms of <em>where you have your domain</em> and <em>where you host your content</em>. If you host your content with Cloudflare, don‚Äôt register the domain there - keep it on a registrar like <a href="https://porkbun.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Porkbun</a> or <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Namecheap</a>. That way if your account is terminated by the host for whatever reason, you‚Äôre not left holding the bag because you can‚Äôt even access your domain to point to another host.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and while I am at it - if you‚Äôre curious to see other places on the web where people established their homes, check out <a href="https://blogscroll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlogScroll</a>.</p>
<h3 id="2-never-concentrate-all-your-work-around-one-network">2. Never concentrate all your work around one network <span><a href="#2-never-concentrate-all-your-work-around-one-network" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3>
<p>If you want to get your work seen in the modern era, it‚Äôs very likely that you <strong>have to</strong> use one of existing social networks with a significant user mass.</p>
<p>Speaking from my own experience, YouTube is doing a moderately good job at making sure that folks discover my video content where I interview guests for <a href="https://theworkitem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my podcast</a>. But at the same time, I still host the podcast on my own site. The audio and video for the podcast is available for download to anyone, even if they are not on YouTube, and folks can find it on other aggregators as well. When I talk about the podcast, I don‚Äôt just bank on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNHIUc6KE64sUe5G0eP70aQ?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a> to bring eyes to my content - I talk about in on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/den.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dendeli/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a>, and even <a href="https://mastodon.social/@localden" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mastodon</a>. And within the recorded episodes, I refer people to <a href="https://theworkitem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>theworkitem.com</code></a> as the destination they should check out for more content, not any of the networks. They can find pointers to those <em>from the website</em>.</p>
<p>This coming year, I will be integrating newsletters on both my blog and podcast because I‚Äôd like to build a way to connect <em>directly</em> to my audience without any middlemen. The mail provider is irrelevant because emails are universal and can be easily transferred between vendors on an as-needed basis.</p>
<p>Build that graph of diversified sources that have your personal site as the final destination for those that want to follow your adventures. Your site can feed those with new audience members, and vice-versa.</p>

<p>You also want to ensure that your site can contribute to audience growth on channels where folks are concentrated - if someone stumbles across your blog post on Hacker News, make it easy for them to find out that you are also on Mastodon or other networks where that visitor might already hang out. Decoupling from the influence of a single network ensures that you build a bit of resilience into your audience and content visibility.</p>
<p>The gist of this is simple - make sure that you‚Äôre not overly-focused on building an audience on just one channel, as any single point of failure can be catastrophic. As with everything in life (including finances and interpersonal relationships), diversification is key. Use Facebook, but also make sure that folks can find you on Bluesky. Sharing photo highlights on Instagram? Great, share them in a photo album on your blog as well and add a story behind it with a few links about the place you took the photo from.</p>
<p>This is also why I <em>love</em> that podcasts survived to this day in their proper RSS feed glory - no network can claim that they own the concept of a podcast. I can listen to my favorite podcasts on <em>any</em> of the available podcast apps because they‚Äôre just audio files linked in a XML file. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs as open as it gets. Anyone can host the files anywhere, and the feed itself can be created by anyone. And while I am certain that services like Spotify will continue to try to build a walled garden around the podcast ecosystem by having folks publish Spotify-exclusive shows or integrate Spotify-specific features that are not available across other podcast apps, I am happy to see that so far these efforts failed to gain any traction outside a few shows. The <em>vast</em> majority of podcasts live on an open network, and I can listen to them without a Spotify account.</p>
<p>And by the way, when I talk about using the existing social channels as a top of the audience funnel, feel zero shame about this tactic - remember when Facebook themselves <a href="https://locusmag.com/2023/01/commentary-cory-doctorow-social-quitting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">built a ‚Äúbridge bot‚Äù</a> to funnel the MySpace network into their ecosystem?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook addressed this problem by giving MySpace users who switched to Facebook a bridge between the two services. Simply give this tool your MySpace login and password, and it would use a bot to login to your MySpace account, scrape all the waiting messages in your queues and inbox, and push them into your Facebook feed. You could reply to these, and the bot would log back into MySpace and post those replies as you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be as self-interested in growing <em>your space</em> as major networks are in growing theirs. Thankfully, despite the centralization, we also have a huge diversity of tools that enable you to do all sorts of nice things around <em>your</em> property, like mailing lists (<a href="https://buttondown.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buttondown</a>, <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mailchimp</a>, and <a href="https://kit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kit</a> come to mind) and monetization systems (such as <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patreon</a>, or <a href="https://gumroad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gumroad</a>).</p>

<p>Everything I am saying here can be interpreted as ‚Äú<em>post your content on your site, treat social networks like link farms to drive traffic to your site</em>‚Äù and that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth.</p>
<p>Social media accounts that just post out-of-context links are of no interest to me and vast majority of people you probably care about. If I see an account do just that, it‚Äôs an instant unfollow. If I wanted <em>just links</em> I‚Äôd subscribe to a RSS feed. Funnily enough, this kind of behavior has been the downfall of a lot of ‚Äúwalled-off‚Äù communities that I‚Äôve been a part of on Slack and Discord - people would use them to self-promote their blogs and other content, and it all became useless because on every visit, I‚Äôd see one hundred links with exactly zero conversation around it. That‚Äôs not the way to go.</p>
<p>Use other channels to <em>meaningfully engage</em> with the community. Answer their questions. Ask for feedback. Build rapport. You are <em>building a community</em>, not flooding the zone with self-promoting content. This will allow you to steer them to places that are more favorable to nurturing and growing your audience long-term.</p>
<h3 id="4-if-possible-build-the-core-of-your-value-in-your-own-yard-rather-than-someone-elses">4. If possible, build the core of your value in your own yard rather than someone else‚Äôs <span><a href="#4-if-possible-build-the-core-of-your-value-in-your-own-yard-rather-than-someone-elses" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3>
<p>I‚Äôve seen this tactic applied by a few folks on YouTube and I think it‚Äôs brilliant. Say, you‚Äôre someone known for teaching people how to use CSS, JavaScript, or anything else. You post <em>some</em> content on YouTube, but make sure to promote the heck out of the courses that you manage on your own site (including monetization). This way, you skip the need to depend on a large network for your income <em>entirely</em> - you still maintain it as a top-of-funnel channel, but the <em>core</em> is on your own turf. You own the <em>distribution</em> while the ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù channels are nothing other than ‚Äúplug-ins‚Äù in your system. You still want them to be reliable, but you‚Äôre not worried about one of them going offline.</p>

<p>This article is sprinkled with this idea, but to make it clear again - <strong>email is a universal protocol</strong> that you can take with you no matter where you go. If you have a mailing list of 1,000 community members that are interested in what you have to say, you can keep that forever (or, until they unsubscribe). A social media account can go ‚Äúpoof‚Äù in a week because the CEO decided that you‚Äôre not worth promoting anymore. Substack not to your liking? No problem - you take the emails and move them to Buttondown. Can‚Äôt quite do the same with an audience on <em>any</em> social network.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, people that entrusted you with their email address are also significantly more invested in reading/watching/listening to your content than an amalgam of followers across the social network landscape, but that could be recency bias.</p>
<p>Always lean towards open and portable standards.</p>

<p>Wrote a blog post? Don‚Äôt just copy and paste the entirety of the content as a LinkedIn post. Post an extract, and then a link to your site. Sharing a new podcast episode? Instead of linking to the YouTube video in your LinkedIn post promoting it, link to the episode page on your website, where people can see how to subscribe on their favorite podcast app, read through the episode transcript, or even check out the resources a guest might‚Äôve shared. The ecosystems I talked about in this post should be your top-of-funnel for your audience.</p>
<p>Yes, some of your posts might be downranked, but that‚Äôs OK, because some of them won‚Äôt. I‚Äôve seen people share my content on Bluesky and LinkedIn as a link, and it drove quite a few folks into my email inbox with suggestions, feedback, and ideas. Have links to your websites in your bio or anywhere where the networks allow you to customize things.</p>

<p>If your building is overgrown with weeds, the sidewalk is cracked (congratulations, you have a tripping hazard), and the insides are covered in dust, the likelihood of quality visitors will decrease. The same applies to your internet property.</p>
<p>If you want to build an audience that keeps consistently coming back, make sure that your website, blog, portfolio, or photo gallery is in good shape. It doesn‚Äôt need to be pixel-perfect, but it needs to show that the author is still there, and there is a reason to stop by. If you post everything to YouTube, link to your site, and the site‚Äôs last content update was in 2004, that doesn‚Äôt inspire confidence that whoever found you on YouTube should also check out your blog - they‚Äôll just see you on YouTube.</p>

<p>As much as I yearn for the era of proper forums to come back, it <em>might be</em> a lost war at scale. But I don‚Äôt need to win the war - I want to engage with a niche audience of folks that care about what I build. For that, as much as possible, leverage tools that foster open engagement that can be discoverable and indexable. <a href="https://www.discourse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discourse</a> is a fantastic option. If you‚Äôre on a budget, integrate comments as GitHub issues on your blog with the help of <a href="https://utteranc.es/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Utterances</a>, like you see here, on <a href="https://den.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>den.dev</code></a>.</p>
<p>The latter has been particularly great for my blog. On one occasion I had a <a href="https://github.com/dend/blog-comments/issues/5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very long chat</a> with a community member about Halo film format reverse engineering - all easily available to anyone in the future.</p>
<p>Avoid locking in your community into a Discord, Slack, or any other proprietary and hidden service that keeps your content locked in.</p>

<p>Having your own corner of the internet is not some kind of ‚Äúpurity test‚Äù where you need to set up an Apache server from scratch, host your mail server, or maintain your own homegrown static site generator running on seventeen generations of Gentoo Linux.</p>
<p>At some point, you will have to depend on other systems and let go of full control. You might use Azure for hosting, Porkbun for domains, a Cloudflare CDN for your images, GitHub for your content backups, AWS S3 for larger files, and so on. I am by no means trying to push you to build your garage server and deal with all the things that come with that decision.</p>

<p>The goal is to give you an opportunity to build something that <em>you have full control of</em> with a <em>good degree of flexibility</em>, all while using <em>off-the-shelf tools and services</em>. None of the services or tools are guaranteed future-proof. Just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extreme circumstances</a> can result in you losing your <em>purchased house</em> (the analogy falls apart in that the government would <em>pay</em> for the property in Eminent Domain cases, but you get the idea), the same can happen with online properties. But it still offers much greater flexibility than depending on some third-party platform to keep your interest at the forefront of their plans.</p>

<p>Your site is not going to be perfect from day one. You are going to run into hiccups with discoverability. You‚Äôll find out that nobody can find it on Google for the first month. That‚Äôs OK. You can pull through this. Keep writing and posting about things you learned, things you saw, or things you‚Äôve otherwise experienced.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-permalink-context="/2025/Jan/2/they-spy-on-you-but-not-like-that/">

<p>2nd January 2025</p>



<p>One of my weirder hobbies is trying to convince people that the idea that companies are listening to you through your phone‚Äôs microphone and serving you targeted ads is a conspiracy theory that isn‚Äôt true. I wrote about this previously: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/14/ai-trust-crisis/#facebook-dont-spy-microphone">Facebook don‚Äôt spy on you through your microphone</a>.</p>
<p>(Convincing people of this is basically impossible. It doesn‚Äôt matter how good your argument is, if someone has ever seen an ad that relates to their previous voice conversation they are likely convinced and there‚Äôs nothing you can do to talk them out of it. Gimlet media did <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/amp/shows/reply-all/z3hlwr">a great podcast episode</a> about how impossible this is back in 2017.)</p>
<p>This is about to get even harder thanks to this proposed settlement: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/apple-agrees-to-pay-95m-delete-private-conversations-siri-recorded/">Siri ‚Äúunintentionally‚Äù recorded private convos; Apple agrees to pay $95M</a> (Ars Technica).</p>
<p>Apple are settling for $95m (nine hours of profit), agreeing to settle while ‚Äúdenying wrongdoing‚Äù.</p>
<p>What actually happened is it turns out Apple were capturing snippets of audio surrounding the ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù wake word, sending those back to their servers and occasionally using them for QA, without informing users that they were doing this. This is bad.</p>
<p>The Reuters 2021 story <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-must-face-siri-voice-assistant-privacy-lawsuit-us-judge-2021-09-02/">Apple must face Siri voice assistant privacy lawsuit -U.S. judge</a> reported that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One Siri user said his private discussions with his doctor about a ‚Äúbrand name surgical treatment‚Äù caused him to receive targeted ads for that treatment, while two others said their discussions about Air Jordan sneakers, Pit Viper sunglasses and ‚ÄúOlive Garden‚Äù caused them to receive ads for those products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The claim from that story was then repeated in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/apple-pay-95-million-settle-siri-privacy-lawsuit-2025-01-02/">the 2025 Reuters story</a> about the settlement.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/apple-agrees-to-pay-95m-delete-private-conversations-siri-recorded/">Ars Technica story</a> reframes that like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only clue that users seemingly had of Siri‚Äôs alleged spying was eerily accurate targeted ads that appeared after they had just been talking about specific items like Air Jordans or brands like Olive Garden, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/apple-pay-95-million-settle-siri-privacy-lawsuit-2025-01-02/">noted</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crucially, this was never <em>proven in court</em>. And if Apple settle the case it never will be.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs think this through. For the accusation to be true, Apple would need to be recording those wake word audio snippets and transmitting them back to their servers for additional processing (likely true), but then they would need to be feeding those snippets <em>in almost real time</em> into a system which forwards them onto advertising partners who then feed that information into targeting networks such that next time you view an ad on your phone the information is available to help select the relevant ad.</p>
<p>That is <em>so far fetched</em>. Why would Apple do that? Especially given both their brand and reputation as a privacy-first company combined with the large amounts of product design and engineering work they‚Äôve put into preventing apps from doing exactly this kind of thing by enforcing permission-based capabilities <em>and</em> ensuring a ‚Äúmicrophone active‚Äù icon is available at all times when an app is listening in.</p>
<p>I really don‚Äôt think this is happening‚Äîin particular for Siri wake words!</p>

<p id="argued-these-points">I‚Äôve <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/14/ai-trust-crisis/#facebook-dont-spy-microphone">argued these points before</a>, but I‚Äôll do it again here for good measure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You don‚Äôt notice the hundreds of times a day you say something and <em>don‚Äôt</em> see a relevant advert a short time later. You see thousands of ads a day, can you remember what <em>any</em> of them are?</li>
<li>The tiny fraction of times where you see an ad that‚Äôs relevant to something you‚Äôve just said (hence breaking through your filter that prevents you from seeing most ads at all) stick in your head.</li>
<li>Human beings are pattern matching machines with a huge bias towards personal anecdotes. If we‚Äôve seen direct evidence of something ourselves, good luck talking us out of it!</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the truth of the matter here is much more pedestrian: the quality of ad targeting that‚Äôs possible just through apps sharing data on your regular actions within those apps is shockingly high... combined with the fact that it turns out just knowing ‚Äúmale, 40s, NYC‚Äù is often more than enough‚Äîwe‚Äôre all pretty basic!</p>
<p>I fully expect that this Apple story will be used as ‚Äúproof‚Äù by conspiracy theorists effectively forever.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I was immediately <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd sniped</a> because I am into low-level performance analysis, and I happen to own an Alder Lake laptop.</p>
<p>A bit of background: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alder_Lake"><em>Alder Lake</em></a> is the 12th generation of Intel Core processors.
It's the first generation with a "hybrid architecture," containing both performance (P) and efficiency (E) cores.
<a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/sarx:shlx:shrx"><code>SHLX</code></a> is a left-shift instruction introduced in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_Bit_manipulation_instruction_set#BMI2_(Bit_Manipulation_Instruction_Set_2)">BMI2</a> instruction set.
The main difference with <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/sal:sar:shl:shr"><code>SHL</code></a> is that <code>SHLX</code> doesn't affect the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register">FLAGS</a> register.
It's also a 3-operand instruction:</p>
<pre><code>        SHL  RAX, CL       ; RAX = RAX &lt;&lt; CL
                           ; (only CL allowed as shift count)

        SHLX RAX, RBX, RDX ; RAX = RBX &lt;&lt; RDX
                           ; (any register allowed as shift count)
</code></pre>
<p>Left-shift is one of the simplest things to implement in hardware, so it's quite surprising that it should take 3 whole CPU cycles.
It's been 1 cycle on every other CPU I'm aware of.
It's even 1 cycle on Alder Lake's <em>efficiency cores</em>!
Only the performance cores have this particular performance problem.</p>
<p>The 3-cycle figure Harold cited comes from <a href="https://uops.info/html-instr/SHLX_R64_R64_R64.html#ADL-P">uops.info</a>.
They even document the exact <a href="https://uops.info/html-lat/ADL-P/SHLX_R64_R64_R64-Measurements.html#lat2-%3E1">instruction sequence</a> used in their benchmark that measured the 3-cycle latency, with a sample <a href="https://github.com/andreas-abel/nanoBench">nanoBench</a> command to reproduce it.
Running that command on my laptop indeed measures 3 cycles of latency.</p>
<p>On the other hand, other sources (like <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/671488/intel-64-and-ia-32-architectures-optimization-reference-manual-volume-1.html">Intel</a> and <a href="http://users.atw.hu/instlatx64/GenuineIntel/GenuineIntel00906A4_AlderLakeP_00_BC_InstLatX64.txt">InstLatX64</a>) claim the latency is 1 cycle.
What gives?
I decided to write my own benchmark to try to understand the discrepancy.</p>
<pre><code>.intel_syntax noprefix
.globl main
main:
        MOV RDX, 10000     ; RDX = 10000
        XOR RAX, RAX       ; RAX = 0
.LOOP:
        MOV RCX, 1         ; RCX = 1
.rept 10000
        SHLX RAX, RAX, RCX ; RAX = RAX &lt;&lt; RCX
                           ; (repeated 10,000 times)
.endr
        DEC RDX
        JNZ .LOOP          ; (loop 10,000 times)
        XOR EAX, EAX
        RET                ; return 0
</code></pre>
<p>This code contains an outer loop with 10,000 iterations.
Inside the loop, we initialize <code>RCX</code> to 1, then run <code>SHLX RAX, RAX, RCX</code> 10,000 times.
In total, we run <code>SHLX</code> 10,000,000 times, so all the other instructions (including the ones before <code>main()</code> runs) are negligible.
I used <code>taskset -c 0</code> to pin it to a P core, and <code>perf</code> for measurement:</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc shlx.s -o shlx
$ taskset -c 0 perf stat --cputype=core -e 'cycles,instructions' ./shlx

 Performance counter stats for './shlx':

       301,614,809      cpu_core/cycles:u/
       100,155,910      cpu_core/instructions:u/         #    0.33  insn per cycle
</code></pre>
<p>Here we see 0.33 instructions per cycle, a.k.a. 3-cycle latency.</p>
<p>Let's try initializing <code>RCX</code> differently:</p>
<pre><code> .LOOP:
-        MOV RCX, 1
+        MOV ECX, 1
</code></pre>
<p><code>ECX</code> is the 32-bit low half of the 64-bit <code>RCX</code> register.
On x86-64, writing a 32-bit register implicitly sets the upper half of the corresponding 64-bit register to zero.
So these two instructions should behave identically.
And yet:</p>
<pre><code> Performance counter stats for './shlx':

       100,321,870      cpu_core/cycles:u/
       100,155,867      cpu_core/instructions:u/         #    1.00  insn per cycle
</code></pre>
<p>It seems like <code>SHLX</code> performs differently depending on how the shift count register is initialized.
If you use a 64-bit instruction with an immediate, performance is slow.
This is also true for instructions like <code>INC</code> (which is similar to <code>ADD</code> with a 1 immediate).</p>
<pre><code> .LOOP:
-        MOV RCX, 1
+        XOR RCX, RCX
+        INC RCX
</code></pre>
<pre><code> Performance counter stats for './shlx':

       300,138,108      cpu_core/cycles:u/
       100,165,881      cpu_core/instructions:u/         #    0.33  insn per cycle
</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, 32-bit instructions, and 64-bit instructions without immediates (even no-op ones), make it fast.
All of these ways to initialize RCX lead to 1-cycle latency:</p>
<pre><code>.LOOP:
        MOV ECX, 1
</code></pre>
<pre><code>.LOOP:
        XOR RCX, RCX
</code></pre>
<pre><code>.LOOP:
        MOV RCX, 1
        MOV RCX, RCX
</code></pre>
<pre><code>        MOV RCX, 1
.LOOP:
        PUSH RCX
        POP RCX
</code></pre>
<p>It is very strange to me that the <em>instruction used to set the shift count register</em> can make the <code>SHLX</code> instruction 3√ó slower.
The 32-bit vs. 64-bit operand size distinction is especially surprising to me as <code>SHLX</code> only looks at the bottom 6 bits of the shift count.</p>
<p>I do not have a good explanation for this yet, but I will update this page if I ever figure it out.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article data-astro-cid-p5zaeqd4=""><p>Life has been a haze this last year. After selling my company, I find myself in the totally un-relatable position of never having to work again. Everything feels like a side quest, but not in an inspiring way. I don‚Äôt have the same base desires driving me to make money or gain status. I have infinite freedom, yet I don‚Äôt know what to do with it, and, honestly, I‚Äôm not the most optimistic about life.</p>
<p>I know. This is a completely zeroth-world position to be in. The point of this post isn‚Äôt to brag or gain sympathy. To be honest, I don‚Äôt exactly know what the point of this post is. I tried to manufacture one, but I just felt like a phony. Then I recognized the irony of creating purpose out of a blog post when I don‚Äôt currently have much conviction or purpose in life.</p>
<p>So I‚Äôll just go ahead and explain my current situation for my own selfish purposes. To push myself to be completely (and awkwardly) vulnerable to a blob of nameless strangers over the internet. No expectations of what comes out of it.</p>
<h2 id="going-to-the-redwoods-and-giving-up-60m">Going to the redwoods and giving up $60m</h2>
<p>Last March I had no idea what to do with my life. I knew that staying at the acquiring company was not it for me for the big company reasons you might suspect (lots of politics, things moved slowly, NPC coworkers, etc.), but I found it very hard to give up a $60m pay package. I had already made more money than I knew what to do with, but your mind does funny things when you start to consider numbers like this.</p>
<p>So I decided to go to the redwoods and figure it out.</p>
<p>Within 5 minutes of my first hike, the trees smiled at me and whispered their simple wisdom.</p>
<p>What is the point of money if it not for freedom?</p>
<p>What is your most scarce resource if not time?</p>
<p>I would leave to do something. Anything. To be alive again. I had no idea. But I was hell bent on making sure everyone knew I had it all figured out. Out of ego. Out of fear of wading into the unknown. When you work on something that consumes your life for a decade, it‚Äôs hard to let go of the certainty and purpose you‚Äôve grown accustomed to.</p>
<h2 id="robotics-or-my-cringe-trying-to-be-elon-phase">Robotics, or my cringe ‚Äútrying to be Elon‚Äù phase</h2>
<p>The immediate 2 weeks after leaving an intense 10-year journey, I did what any healthy person does and met with over 70 investors and founders in robotics. I had been learning about robotics for quite some time and was positive I wanted to throw myself into giving computers arms and legs. I had come up with all the tag lines to delude myself into thinking this was my ‚Äúlife‚Äôs calling‚Äù. Everything had been ‚Äúleading to this exact point‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe world is going through a major labor shortage!‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe must stay competitive against China!‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe market for highly repetitive labor is multiple trillions of dollars.‚Äù</p>
<p>At the end of the 2 weeks, I left feeling deflated and foolish. I didn‚Äôt want to start a robotics company. The only thing that seemed interesting to me was humanoids. It started to dawn on me that what I actually wanted was to look like Elon, and that is incredibly cringe. It hurts to even type this out.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-up-with-my-girlfriend-and-realizing-im-very-insecure">Breaking up with my girlfriend and realizing I‚Äôm very insecure</h2>
<p>After deciding to not start a robotics company, I found myself rudderless. No sense of direction. I traveled to many beautiful places with my loving and supportive (ex) girlfriend. This 6 month stretch could be several essays on its own, but the outcome of this period is that nothing seemed right.</p>
<p>We started getting into regular arguments, and I knew it wasn‚Äôt on her. It was me. I was starting to come to terms with all the mounting insecurities I had stuffed down over the past several years. I didn‚Äôt feel like I could work on them with her. So I broke things off after almost 2 years of unconditional love. It was extremely painful, but it was the right call. I needed to fully face myself.</p>
<p>I have only started to realize that, when Loom was in its early innings, I felt very secure with my position in life, and lots of this stemmed from an extreme gratitude for the journey I was on. I was happy with everything as it was. The growth trajectory of the company was more than I could ever dream for. I was happy. I felt secure. It could all turn to shit the next day, and that would be ok.</p>
<p>Then, as the company continued to skyrocket to new heights, I started to have growing expectations for myself, and others started to have growing expectations of me. When we went through our first round of layoffs, this company my ego was hitched to had suffered a massive blow, so I lost myself. This whole chapter of Loom has created a complex web of internalized insecurities I must now work hard to disentangle and free myself from.</p>
<p>(If my ex is reading this. Thank you for everything. I am sorry I couldn‚Äôt be what you needed me to be.)</p>
<h2 id="climbing-mountains-in-the-himalayas-remembering-to-do-hard-things">Climbing mountains in the Himalayas, remembering to do hard things</h2>
<p>After breaking up with my girlfriend, I did what any healthy person would do and decided to externalize my emotions by climbing a 6800m peak in the Himalayas with absolutely no mountaineering experience or training. In the earliest stages of trekking into the valley, before the altitude sickness, cold, and chronic bronchitis started to settle in, this seemed like the best idea in the world. It wasn‚Äôt until every person I met along the way asked how long I had been training for, that it started to settle in how insane what I was doing was.</p>
<p>Needless to say, there were some rough patches. I got very hypoxic on one of my summits and had to repel down cliff faces while tripping out of my mind. In the end, I pushed through, completed both my planned summits, and got reacquainted with how important doing hard things is to me. It is the heart beat of my life, and I don‚Äôt 100% understand why, but it probably has something to do with me having not the best childhood.</p>
<p>When I got back home and regaled my friends with my mountain stories, one of my friends joked that I should work for Elon and Vivek at DOGE and help America get off its current crash to defaulting on its own debt. So I reached out to some people and got in. After 8 calls with people who all talked fast and sounded very <del>autistic</del> smart, I was added to a number of Signal groups and immediately put to work.</p>
<h2 id="working-for-doge-for-4-weeks-remembering-the-power-of-urgency">Working for DOGE for 4 weeks, remembering the power of urgency</h2>
<p>Within 2 minutes of talking to the final interviewer for DOGE, he asked me if I wanted to join. I said ‚Äúyes‚Äù. Then he said ‚Äúcool‚Äù and I was in multiple Signal groups. I was immediately acquainted with the software, HR, and legal teams and went from 0 to 100 taking meetings and getting shit done. This was the day before Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>The next 4 weeks of my life consisted of 100s of calls recruiting the smartest people I‚Äôve ever talked to, working on various projects I‚Äôm definitely not able to talk about, and learning how completely dysfunctional the government was. It was a blast.</p>
<p>I learned about the power of urgency and having an undeniable mission. Not by reading it somewhere. By experiencing it. I came to realize how laughable my robotics stint had been in comparison. And I started to realize that, although the mission of DOGE is extremely important, it wasn‚Äôt the most important thing I needed to focus on with urgency for myself. I needed to get back to ambiguity, focus on my insecurities, and be ok with that for a while. DOGE wasn‚Äôt going to fix that.</p>
<p>So, after 4 intense and intoxicating weeks, I called off my plans to move to DC and embark on a journey to save our government with some of the smartest people I‚Äôve ever met. And I booked a 1-way ticket to Hawaii.</p>
<h2 id="studying-physics-in-the-jungle-focusing-on-my-insecurities">Studying physics in the jungle, focusing on my insecurities</h2>
<p>So now I‚Äôm in Hawaii. I‚Äôm learning physics. Why? The reason I tell myself is to build up my first principles foundation so I can start a company that manufactures real world things. It seems plausible, but I‚Äôm learning to just accept that I am happy learning physics. That‚Äôs the goal in and of itself. If it leads to nothing, that‚Äôs ok. If this means I‚Äôll never do something as spectacular as Loom, so be it. It‚Äôs been too long since I‚Äôve been completely raw and real with myself, so I‚Äôm applying a healthy dose of humility to everything I say and do. It‚Äôs the only thing that feels authentic.</p>
<p>However, there are some questions left unanswered.</p>
<p>Why did I need to do the absolute most to reach this point?</p>
<p>Why couldn‚Äôt I just leave Loom and say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I want to do next‚Äù?</p>
<p>Why do I feel the need to only be on a journey if it‚Äôs grand?</p>
<p>What is wrong with being insignificant?</p>
<p>Why is letting people down so hard?</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know. But I‚Äôm going to find out.</p></article></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Language models (LMs) are powerful tools for natural language processing, but they often struggle to produce coherent and fluent text when they are small. Models with around 125M parameters such as GPT-Neo (small) or GPT-2 (small) can rarely generate coherent and consistent English text beyond a few words even after extensive training. This raises the question of whether the emergence of the ability to produce coherent English text only occurs at larger scales (with hundreds of millions of parameters or more) and complex architectures (with many layers of global attention).
<br>In this work, we introduce TinyStories, a synthetic dataset of short stories that only contain words that a typical 3 to 4-year-olds usually understand, generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. We show that TinyStories can be used to train and evaluate LMs that are much smaller than the state-of-the-art models (below 10 million total parameters), or have much simpler architectures (with only one transformer block), yet still produce fluent and consistent stories with several paragraphs that are diverse and have almost perfect grammar, and demonstrate reasoning capabilities.
<br>We also introduce a new paradigm for the evaluation of language models: We suggest a framework which uses GPT-4 to grade the content generated by these models as if those were stories written by students and graded by a (human) teacher. This new paradigm overcomes the flaws of standard benchmarks which often requires the model's output to be very structures, and moreover provides a multidimensional score for the model, providing scores for different capabilities such as grammar, creativity and consistency.
<br>We hope that TinyStories can facilitate the development, analysis and research of LMs, especially for low-resource or specialized domains, and shed light on the emergence of language capabilities in LMs.

As a Sr. Software Engineer &amp; Web-developer primarily working with Python frameworks. I am comfortable wearing many hats, and have worked through small to large sized projects for different sized clients (small to enterprise), building tech both on the Back &amp; Front-end as well as Infra.</p><p>I am currently looking for an AI or LLM company to work with. I have worked with clients in AI since 2022 - and am currently spending several hours per day experimenting with AI &amp; LLMs. From getting my hands dirty with the latest models and papers, to working on small applications that use AI. Especially when it comes to agentive apps (read: function calling or code writing-and-executing models), real world simulations (simulating 1000s of interactions with LLMs) or forecasting with LLMs. I have a few exploratory side-projects to show. And a huge amount of passion for the subject matter (productizing AI &amp; LLMS) to bring to the table. AI-Stack keywords: LangChain, LLamaIndex, AutoML, MLFlow, AG2 (formerly Autogen).</p></div></td></tr>

Hi, I'm Harry Altman!  I was the maintainer of Truffle Debugger (<a href="https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/packages/debugger">https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/package...</a>), a Solidity smart contract debugger, for 5 years.  I eventually ended up writing my own decoding and encoding libraries to support it, as well as a bunch of other things.</p><p>I'm good at this sort of nitpicky work, spotting and thinking about edge cases.  I like getting things <i>exactly</i> right, even though that obviously isn't always possible due to various constraints.  I've been kind of wondering if I should get into embedded development; I find it appealing when things are low-level or similarly constrained.  I've beaten Microcorruption. :)  (The original levels, I haven't played the new ones.)</p><p>I'm also quite interested in unusual or obscure data formats, and working on Truffle Debugger and its associated libraries certainly involved a bunch of having to figure undocumented formats and interfaces. :)  I put down above what languages I've worked substantially in but I'd say I'm a generalist and will figure out whatever you give me (I knew approximately no Javascript, Typescript, or Solidity when I started working at Consensys).</p><p>I'm a mathematician by background and in my spare time, so after the Truffle Debugger project was shut down I took some time off to focus on my mathematical projects.  But now I'm looking for work again!  If you need someone like me, I'm available for hire!</p></div></td></tr>

Previously, I launched a React Native mobile app that offered pet parents 0% bridge financing loans for vet care in just four months, offering folks the ability to afford necessary vet care for the first time.</p><p>I've worked on static, server-rendered, and SPA websites, built React Native mobile apps, deployed APIs using Elixir, Python, and Typescript (Node.js + Deno), and recently I've been tinkering with desktop applications using Tauri + Rust.</p><p>To see my open-source projects, see my GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/phildenhoff">https://github.com/phildenhoff</a></p></div></td></tr>

I've been programming for nearly two decades and have a lot of experience in various technologies. Lately I've been doing some fun stuff with Elixir and Zig related to graphics programming. I love working on weird, unknown projects. My wide range of experience (both with and without computers) helps me figure out tasks that don't have much prior art. I'm also equally thrilled by getting into the nitty gritty of deeply technical things like writing parsers for obscure binary formats. If you have some weird ideas that you don't have someone on your team to figure out, let me know!</p></div></td></tr>

I've had the opportunity to work as a founding engineer at multiple companies, where I've been involved in building and scaling platforms from scratch. 
At PreFix Inc., I led the backend development of our home maintenance platform, working as the sole backend engineer early on. I played a key role in scaling the customer base, integrating critical systems like Zendesk, Stripe, and HubSpot, and developing our business intelligence platform to enable data-driven decision-making. I also helped expand the engineering team and contributed to major partnerships, including a successful pilot program with a large insurance company, and the many security, privacy and data handling challenges that entails.</p><p>Before that, at Ruckit, I was part of the founding team where we developed a collaborative logistics platform that scaled the company to over $2M in monthly revenue. I managed a distributed team of engineers, drove third-party integrations, and helped position the company for acquisition by Command Alkon.</p><p>Now it's time for something new.  You can checkout my CV/resume linked above for lots more details, and please reach out with any interesting opportunities.</p></div></td></tr>

While working for Pivot Interactives, I was a full-stack web developer implementing features from the design phase to deployment. I created easy-to-use and accessible tools for teachers and students to supplement high-school-level science labs. This included integrations with learning platforms, custom WYSIWYG editor components, auto-grading assignments, and student testing systems.</p><p>Before Pivot Interactives, I was a senior software development engineer at Corning Inc, creating hardware/software that quality controls consumer display glass in factories worldwide. I also wrote tools for scientists to interface with custom-made hardware and commercially available equipment.

I'm a seasoned data + AI leader with 10+ years experience building high-performance teams focused on automation, analytics, and data-driven results. I'm the type of person who looks at complex data challenges and sees opportunities for radical transformation. Whether it's automating workflows, experimenting with AI, or creating novel ML models that drive efficiency, I'm all about pushing boundaries and turning data into a growth accelerator.</p><p>I was previously co-founder of a B2B data operations tool, Shipyard. Before that, I was the Head of Data at PMG Digital Agency where I built the team from the ground up. It's most important for me to work for a mission-driven company that wants to scale with bold and innovative approaches. I want to sink my teeth into tough problems and learn new things.</p><p>I'll do my best work focused on a mix of data, AI, and product. I can seamlessly adapt between IC or management roles and I prefer to have a decent amount of time hands on. Smaller organizations with the ability to build something from the ground up is a big plus. Despite my background, I'd like to avoid working in the advertising space.</p></div></td></tr>

Hi, I'm Winston! I'm a backend software engineer and Certified Public Accountant (CPA) with a background in fintech, and I specialize in bridging the gap between financial systems and code.</p><p>Before transitioning into software engineering, I started my career in big 4 public accounting at EY, auditing major financial services firms and consulting on IT systems to ensure SOX compliance for IPO readiness[0]. These experiences taught me how companies waste millions fixing mistakes in their financial systems that could have been avoided with a software engineer who deeply understands accounting.</p><p>In my most recent role, I was the lead developer for the fintech team at a logistics company, where I built a scalable invoicing service that processed thousands of parcels per day. Within six months, I was promoted to lead engineer, managing two junior developers and designing the architecture for the next-generation service.</p><p>My unique blend of technical and accounting expertise enables me to translate complex US GAAP requirements into scalable, compliant software systems, helping growing companies avoid costly errors and stay ahead of their competitors.</p><p>I race cars for fun and have survived multiple accounting busy seasons, so I thrive under pressure. I hold a master's degree and passed all four sections of the CPA exam on my first attempt (8% pass rate), so I also know how to tackle tough challenges.</p><p>No one has ever been fired for hiring a CPA to work on accounting-related problems. Accounting is complicated, and you don't have the time to teach another software engineer 10+ years of formal study and experience. Don't overthink it! Let's talk about how I can improve your company's financial systems and make your life easier to focus on earning more money.</p><p>[0]: <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/consulting/why-sox-preparation-can-be-the-key-to-ipo-success" rel="nofollow">https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/consulting/why-sox-prepara...</a></p></div></td></tr>

I'm a senior full-stack engineer with a good amount of applied AI experience. Eight years ago, I co-founded an AI Math Tutoring company (amy.app). My role was CTO, and we scaled the company to about 25 employees. It was a fully remote company, and we were distributed across all parts of the world.</p><p>Before that, I completed my PhD in HRI (Human-Robot Interaction) at the University of Oxford, in conjunction with the University of Canterbury, where I focused on the persuasive power of voice agents. My favorite working environments are early-stage startups with high growth potential.</p><p>Recently, with the release of the OpenAI real-time API, my interest in VUI (Voice User Interface) was reignited. I really love the VUI paradigm and strongly believe it will be the next big change in the way we communicate with computers.</p><p>Here is a project I built during the winter holiday: <a href="https://www.callgeist.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.callgeist.com</a>. I used almost exclusively Cursor for the UI. The backend uses Twilio + OpenAI real-time.</p><p>Here are a couple of other things I did last year:</p><pre><code>    - https://www.line-items.com is a simple receipt-to-JSON parser. This was written in just one day, but it landed on the front page of HN.
    - https://distill.fyi is LinkedIn on steroids, auto-generating user profiles given a LinkedIn URL. My task was to build a QA system that detects if generated profiles would regress because of prompt changes. I used my know-how from amy.app, where we had a similar problem of undetected "approved" content regression due to prompt changes. 
    - https://www.spaarkd.com is a company that allows you to prompt a garment, which is then produced and delivered to your doorstep. My job was to set up the entire infrastructure, orchestration (payment, shipping, production line), and team.</code></pre></div></td></tr>

Included in this is a massive geospatial data problem, involving data models of variable human movement patterns, constantly evolving physical environment data, and data models tailored for multi-objective optimization.</p><p>Currently employed, with intense side projects, mostly happy with my current job, but always willing to entertain different employers.

I work daily in Python, FastAPI, Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Linux, MacOS, Docker, AWS (EC2, RDS, Elastic Beanstalk, IAM), Git. I'm familiar (Use most months) with ElasticSearch, CloudSearch, Tailwind, Vue. As Hobbies, or smaller projects (used on at least one completed project over the past five years): Go, Zig, C, C++, Rust, Phoenix, NoSQL, MongoDB, (probably more, but these were the ones that came to mind.)</p><p>My day job has me performing two main functions:</p><p>- Building full stack web development systems. I generally lean more towards writing backend code, and documenting our infrastructure. UI is my weakest area. This role has me working in datasets with ~1 billion row tables, and search indexes with ~100 million documents. Since we're a small company (~8 developers), I have been a major part of the architecture of our systems over the past 8 years. We've got five separate core businesses that our dev team supports, and I've been a part of architecting and implementing all of them. I would prefer to focus more on backend development in a future role.</p><p>- Creating one-off scripts or processes to assist in business functions. These tend to involve quickly reverse engineering undocumented web APIs we have permission to use, and querying them for our customers. At their simplest, these are a mix of writing some SQL and a few HTTP requests. At their most complicated, they have involved designing and implementing a tree structure to accurately model the business domain, and then pulling data about these structures from relevant public APIs.</p><p>- Miscellaneous tasks as they come up, recently, I reduced the cost of a company's AWS CloudSearch spend by 80% (over 10k/month) by reviewing their codebase, doing some research, and improving what they were storing and how they were doing so. This required a one-line code change on the existing codebase, and writing a new, short (~500 line) indexer. Doing a deep dive into the single highest AWS line item was the impetus for the project, and frankly, it turned out far better than expected.
Outside of work, I ran <a href="https://www.thiswebsitewillselfdestruct.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.thiswebsitewillselfdestruct.com</a>, a website I built and maintain. It really will self-destruct, and it reaches ~100k users and handles ~13M requests each month. Building tools and infrastructure to manage its moderation and keep it a positive community has been a huge learning experience.</p><p>Email: Femme@Femmeandroid.com</p><p>Good luck with whatever you're working on!</p></div></td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><article><header></header><p>Most software tutorials are tragically flawed.</p><p>Tutorials often forget to mention some key detail, preventing readers from replicating the author‚Äôs process. Other times, the author brings in hidden assumptions that don‚Äôt match their readers‚Äô expectations.</p><p>The good news is that it‚Äôs easier than you think to write an exceptional software tutorial. You can stand out in a sea of mediocre guides by following a few simple rules.</p><h2 id="rules">Rules<a href="#rules">üîó</a></h2><ol><li><a href="#write-for-beginners">Write for beginners</a></li><li><a href="#promise-a-clear-outcome-in-the-title">Promise a clear outcome in the title</a></li><li><a href="#explain-the-goal-in-the-introduction">Explain the goal in the introduction</a></li><li><a href="#show-the-end-result">Show the end result</a></li><li><a href="#make-code-snippets-copypasteable">Make code snippets copy/pasteable</a></li><li><a href="#use-long-versions-of-command-line-flags">Use long versions of command-line flags</a></li><li><a href="#separate-user-defined-values-from-reusable-logic">Separate user-defined values from reusable logic</a></li><li><a href="#spare-the-reader-from-mindless-tasks">Spare the reader from mindless tasks</a></li><li><a href="#let-computers-evaluate-conditional-logic">Let computers evaluate conditional logic</a></li><li><a href="#keep-your-code-in-a-working-state">Keep your code in a working state</a></li><li><a href="#teach-one-thing">Teach one thing</a></li><li><a href="#dont-try-to-look-pretty">Don‚Äôt try to look pretty</a></li><li><a href="#minimize-dependencies">Minimize dependencies</a></li><li><a href="#specify-filenames-clearly">Specify filenames clearly</a></li><li><a href="#use-consistent-descriptive-headings">Use consistent, descriptive headings</a></li><li><a href="#demonstrate-that-your-solution-works">Demonstrate that your solution works</a></li><li><a href="#link-to-a-complete-example">Link to a complete example</a></li></ol><h2 id="write-for-beginners">Write for beginners<a href="#write-for-beginners">üîó</a></h2><p>The most common mistake tutorials make is explaining beginner-level concepts using expert-level terminology.</p><p>Most people who seek out tutorials are beginners. They may not be beginners to programming, but they‚Äôre beginners to the domain they‚Äôre trying to learn about.</p><div><p>In this tutorial, I‚Äôll show you how to create your first ‚ÄúHello world‚Äù SPA using React.</p><p>Open the included <code>hello.jsx</code> file and change the greeting from <code>"Hello world"</code> to <code>"Hello universe"</code>.</p><p>The browser should hot reload with the new text. Because of React‚Äôs efficient JSX transpilation, the change feels instant.</p><p>The browser doesn‚Äôt even have to soft reload the page because React‚Äôs reconciliation engine compares the virtual DOM to the rendered DOM and updates only the DOM elements that require changes.</p></div><p>The above example would confuse and alienate beginners.</p><p>A developer who‚Äôs new to the React web framework won‚Äôt understand terms like ‚ÄúJSX transpilation‚Äù or ‚Äúreconciliation engine.‚Äù They probably also won‚Äôt understand ‚ÄúSPA,‚Äù ‚Äúsoft reload,‚Äù or ‚Äúvirtual DOM‚Äù unless they‚Äôve worked with other JavaScript frameworks.</p><p>When you‚Äôre writing a tutorial, remember that you‚Äôre explaining things to a non-expert. Avoid jargon, abbreviations, or terms that would be meaningless to a newcomer.</p><p>Here‚Äôs an introduction to a React tutorial that uses language most readers will understand, even if they have no background in programming:</p><div><p>In this tutorial, I‚Äôll show you how to create a simple webpage using modern web development tools.</p><p>To generate the website, I‚Äôm using React, a free and popular tool for building websites.</p><p>React is a great tool for creating your first website, but it‚Äôs also full-featured and powerful enough to build sophisticated apps that serve millions of users.</p></div><p>Writing for beginners doesn‚Äôt mean alienating everyone with more experience. A knowledgeable reader can scan your tutorial and skip the information they already know, but a beginner can‚Äôt read a guide for experts.</p><h2 id="promise-a-clear-outcome-in-the-title">Promise a clear outcome in the title<a href="#promise-a-clear-outcome-in-the-title">üîó</a></h2><p>If a prospective reader is Googling a problem, would the title of your article lead them to the solution? If they see your tutorial on social media or in a newsletter, will your title convince them it‚Äôs worth clicking?</p><p>Consider the following weak titles:</p><div><ul><li>A Complete Guide to Becoming a Python CSV Ninja</li><li>How to Build Your Own Twitter</li><li>Key Mime Pi: A Cool Gadget You Can Make</li><li>How to Combine Django with Front-End JavaScript</li></ul></div><p>The above examples are poor titles because they‚Äôre vague. From the title alone, you‚Äôd be hard-pressed to say what the tutorial will teach you.</p><p>A tutorial‚Äôs title should explain succinctly what the reader can expect to achieve by following your guide.</p><p>Here are clearer rewrites of the previous titles:</p><div><ul><li>How to Read a CSV File in Python</li><li>Build a Real-Time Twitter Clone in 15 Minutes with Phoenix LiveView</li><li>Key Mime Pi: Turn Your Raspberry Pi into a Remote Keyboard</li><li>Organizing Your Front-End Codebase in a Django Project</li></ul></div><p>These titles give you a clear sense of what you‚Äôd learn by reading the tutorial. The titles are clear and specific in what the tutorial delivers.</p><h2 id="explain-the-goal-in-the-introduction">Explain the goal in the introduction<a href="#explain-the-goal-in-the-introduction">üîó</a></h2><p>If the reader clicks your tutorial, you‚Äôre off to a great start. Someone is interested in what you have to say. But you still have to convince them to continue reading.</p><p>As the reader begins a tutorial, they‚Äôre trying to answer two critical questions as quickly as possible:</p><ol><li>Should I care about this technology?</li><li>If I care, is this the right tutorial for me?</li></ol><p>The first few sentences of your article should answer those questions.</p><p>For example, if you were writing a tutorial about how to use Docker containers, this would be a terrible introduction:</p><div><h3 id="an-introduction-to-docker-containers">An Introduction to Docker Containers<a href="#an-introduction-to-docker-containers">üîó</a></h3><p>Docker is an extremely powerful and versatile technology. It allows you to run your app in a container, which means that it‚Äôs separate from everything else on the system.</p><p>In this tutorial, I‚Äôll show you how to use Docker to run containers on your internal infrastructure as well as in the cloud.</p></div><p>Based on the above introduction, what problem does Docker solve? Who should use it?</p><p>The introduction fails to answer those questions and instead hand-waves with vague terms that ignore anything the reader cares about.</p><p>Here‚Äôs a rewrite that explains how Docker solves pain points the reader might have:</p><div><h3 id="how-to-use-docker-for-reliable-app-deployments">How to Use Docker for Reliable App Deployments<a href="#how-to-use-docker-for-reliable-app-deployments">üîó</a></h3><p>Do you have a production server that you‚Äôre terrified to touch because nobody knows how to rebuild it if it goes offline? Have you ever torn your hair out trying to figure out why your staging environment behaves differently than your production environment?</p><p>Docker is a tool for packaging your app so that it has a consistent, reproducible environment wherever it runs. What‚Äôs more, it allows you to define your app‚Äôs environment and dependencies in source code, so you know exactly what‚Äôs there, even if your app has survived years of tweaks by different teams.</p><p>In this tutorial, I‚Äôll show you how to use Docker to package a simple web app and help you avoid common Docker gotchas.</p></div><p>The above introduction explains the problems Docker solves and what the tutorial will deliver.</p><p>The introduction doesn‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúThis tutorial is for people who are brand new to Docker,‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt need to.

Now, anyone interested in full-text search has to untangle the search concepts from everything else.</p><p>People come to a tutorial because they want to learn one new thing. Let them learn that one thing in isolation.</p><div><p>In this tutorial, I‚Äôll show you how to add client-side search to your Hugo blog so that readers can do instant, full-text search of all your blog posts, even on spotty mobile connections.</p><p>That‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôll demonstrate in this tutorial.</p></div><h3 id="if-you-have-to-stack-technologies-wait-until-the-end">If you have to stack technologies, wait until the end<a href="#if-you-have-to-stack-technologies-wait-until-the-end">üîó</a></h3><p>Sometimes, a tutorial has to combine technologies.</p><p>For example, the PHP web programming language doesn‚Äôt have a production-grade web server built-in.

If you‚Äôre teaching PHP, take the tutorial as far as you can go using PHP‚Äôs development server. If you show how to deploy the PHP app in production using nginx, push those steps to the end so everyone who prefers a different web server can follow everything in your tutorial until the web server portion.</p><h2 id="dont-try-to-look-pretty">Don‚Äôt try to look pretty<a href="#dont-try-to-look-pretty">üîó</a></h2><p>Here‚Äôs an excerpt from an article I read recently.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you guessed that I was reading a tutorial about a CSS framework, you‚Äôd be wrong.</p><p>The above snippet was from a tutorial about using the <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> element in the Vue web framework. So, why was half the code just CSS classes? The author added them to make their example look pretty.</p><p>Here‚Äôs the same snippet as above, reduced to the code necessary to convey the concept:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span>&lt;div class=<span>"card"</span>&gt;

They want a tutorial that makes new concepts obvious.</p><h2 id="minimize-dependencies">Minimize dependencies<a href="#minimize-dependencies">üîó</a></h2><p>Every tutorial has dependencies. At the very least, the reader needs an operating system, but they likely also need a particular compiler, library, or framework to follow your examples.</p><p>Every dependency pushes work onto the reader. They need to figure out how to install and configure it on their system, which reduces their chances of completing your tutorial.</p><p>Make your tutorial easy on the reader by minimizing the number of dependencies it requires.</p><div><p>We‚Äôre at step 12 of this tutorial, so it‚Äôs time to install a bunch of annoying packages I didn‚Äôt mention earlier:</p><ul><li>ffmpeg, compiled with the libpita extension (precompiled binaries are not available)</li><li>A special fork of Node.js that my friend Slippery Pete published in 2010 (you‚Äôll need Ubuntu 6.06 to compile it)</li><li>Perl 4</li></ul></div><p>The most common and frivolous dependencies I see are date parsing libraries. Have you seen instructions like this?</p><div><p>The CSV file contains dates in <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> format. To parse it, install this 400 MB library designed to parse any date string in any format, language, and locale.</p></div><p>You never need a whole third-party library to parse a simple date string in example code. At worst, you can parse it yourself with five lines of code.</p><p>Beyond making your guide harder to follow, each dependency also decreases your tutorial‚Äôs lifespan. In a month, the external library might push an update that breaks your code. Or the publisher could unpublish the library, and now your tutorial is useless.</p><p>You can‚Äôt always eliminate dependencies, so use them strategically. If your tutorial resizes an image, go ahead and use a third-party image library instead of reimplementing JPEG decoding from scratch. But if you can save yourself a dependency with less than 20 lines of code, it‚Äôs almost always better to keep your tutorial lean.</p><h3 id="pin-your-dependencies-to-specific-versions">Pin your dependencies to specific versions<a href="#pin-your-dependencies-to-specific-versions">üîó</a></h3><p>Be explicit about which versions of tools and libraries you use in your tutorial.

miniKanren is a family of Domain Specific Languages for logic programming.</p><p>

The name <i>kanren</i> comes from a Japanese word (Èñ¢ÈÄ£) meaning "relation".</p><p>

The core miniKanren language is very simple, with only three logical operators and one interface operator.<br>
The core language, using Scheme as the host language, is described in this <a href="http://io.livecode.ch/learn/webyrd/webmk">short, interactive tutorial</a>.</p><p>

miniKanren has been implemented in a growing number of <a href="#implementations">host languages</a>, including Scheme, Racket, Clojure,<br> Haskell, Python, JavaScript, Scala, Ruby, OCaml, and PHP, among many other languages.</p><p>

miniKanren is designed to be easily modified and extended; extensions include Constraint Logic Programming,<br>
probabilistic logic programming, nominal logic programming, and tabling.</p><p>

A detailed discussion of the differences between miniKanren and Prolog <a href="http://minikanren.org/minikanren-and-prolog.html">can be found here</a>.</p><h2> miniKanren Workshops and other Meetings </h2>

Not necessarily SaaS click-and-drool tools for corporate drones, but unique and opinionated products that have some significant engineering innovation inside. Those companies have essentially no ability to attract talent organically, anyone interested in FANG would turn up their noses, and their number one problem is quality people. In many cases the CEO/CTO leadership is incredibly strong and smart; the colleagues are happy, motivated, intelligent, and disciplined; and the work/life balance is good for the middle aged. They're vital to their customers but under continuous competitive pressure so it is far from a snoozy place to serve out time - it's a mission and a struggle every day, things change often, the pace is fast. It can be very rewarding and compensation is decent. The tradeoff is the big exit is vanishingly unlikely.</p><p>Second idea is go into consulting/professional services. Not Accenture or anything horrible like that, but dozens of boutique/smaller firms with decently inspiring leadership and a very high standard of colleague. Work is variable in interest and environment, pressures are somewhat unfairly around whether you are billable or not which is not really in your control as an engineer.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>My longest employment stint was at such a company and it was a very good experience for me. That said, even though I worked at such a company for a while, I don't have a very good idea how I would go about identifying other such companies with open roles. Any suggestions on how to do that?</p>

I'm now working at a small- to mid-sized (~80 people) local B2B company. Pay is fine, they offer 100% WFH if you want, but they also have nice offices, they make good and stable revenue with reasonable growth targets, the actual work is somewhere between interesting and mind-numbingly stupid (e.g. integrating with poorly documented enterprise software - can be fun, but can also be aggravating), people are mostly happy.</p><p>There is a focus on delivering for clients rather than following processes.</p><p>I have about an hour of required meetings a week, 15-30 minutes technical meetings where people bring up any tech roadblocks or things where they need help, and a 20-45 minute sprint planning meeting. There's one monthly "show cool stuff" meeting for the whole company where everybody can voluntarily show something interesting they made. The rest of the time, I'm writing code, documentation, helping coworkers, talking to clients, stuff like that.</p><p>There is very high trust, e.g. people make honest effort estimates and there's no punishment or bad feedback if they're missed. There's a wide variety of skills because it's hard to attract top performers. This makes it easy to get hired (they immediately invited me for an interview after I sent them my CV, and made an offer after talking to me for 30 minutes), and it also means there's a culture of helping people and being patient and understanding when people are making an honest effort, but don't quite get things on the first try.</p><p>I'm working eight hours a day, five days a week, and when I'm done with work for the day, I don't think about it until the next day. It's nice.</p></div></td></tr>

Since turning 40 I tried: moving into management at a ~100 dev company; IC at a big tech firm (first time I‚Äôd worked somewhere really big as a dev); and now I‚Äôm back to running tech side of things at a startup.</p><p>I don‚Äôt think I could have known in advance which of those was going to work for me.

                  <p>For me it was management.  I was an SDE who started caring more about the users of my code than about the code itself and that led me to a team lead position and that led to management at a small company and that led to management at a big company. I found I really like mentoring junior engineers and I'm a good sounding board for senior engineers.  I got to spend a lot of time saying variations on "Hey, let's not do that thing that won't work, let's do something easier that will work."  I also focused a lot more on my career and making money rather than most of my life which I spent focused on cool tech and that got me to a place where I could retire easily when the time was right.  Now I code for fun and I still chat with former colleagues from time to time and get to say things like "Yeah, but you know option B is the right choice so go do that."  None of it was clearly planned, all of it was stressful but in the end it sort of worked out.</p>

I have been basically doing 8:15am to 3pm for my hours (no discussion with management about it - it's just what I do), essentially logging off at 3pm to go collect my kids and not logging back on after that (although I keep a rough eye on chat and email and jump back on if something urgent/critical comes up) and no one has batted an eye lid at all - so long as the work gets done, people are happy and are not closely monitoring where you are or how you are working. Some of the work is interesting and engaging, other part are more "meh" but I think that is true of many jobs really.</p><p>Yes I might be able to get slightly more money elsewhere (especially fintech) and might get to work on more sphincter-clenchingly-exciting work elsewhere (especially startups) but the quality of life from what is quite an easy ride of things is very valuable to me. Google is quite grown up in many ways and the culture is calm and predictable (on the whole - the recent (year or two ago) redundancies were <i>not</i> predicted!)</p><p>I'd recommend it.</p></div></td></tr>

<p dir="auto">To create a specification by inspecting HTTP traffic you will need to:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Capture the traffic by using the mitmproxy tool. I personally recommend using mitmweb, which is a web interface built-in to mitmproxy.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ mitmweb

<p dir="auto"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">To configure your client to use the proxy exposed by mitm proxy, please consult the <a href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/" rel="nofollow">mitmproxy documentation</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Save the traffic to a flow file.</p>
<p dir="auto">In mitmweb you can do this by using the "File" menu and selecting "Save":</p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Run the first pass of mitmproxy2swagger:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ mitmproxy2swagger -i <path_to_mitmptoxy_flow> -o <path_to_output_schema> -p <api_prefix>
# ... or ...
$ docker run -it -v $PWD:/app mitmproxy2swagger mitmproxy2swagger -i <path_to_mitmptoxy_flow> -o <path_to_output_schema> -p <api_prefix>"><pre>$ mitmproxy2swagger -i <span>&lt;</span>path_to_mitmptoxy_flow<span>&gt;</span> -o <span>&lt;</span>path_to_output_schema<span>&gt;</span> -p <span>&lt;</span>api_prefix<span>&gt;</span>
<span><span>#</span> ... or ...</span>
$ docker run -it -v <span>$PWD</span>:/app mitmproxy2swagger mitmproxy2swagger -i <span>&lt;</span>path_to_mitmptoxy_flow<span>&gt;</span> -o <span>&lt;</span>path_to_output_schema<span>&gt;</span> -p <span>&lt;</span>api_prefix<span>&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Please note that you can use an existing schema, in which case the existing schema will be extended with the new data. You can also run it a few times with different flow captures, the captured data will be safely merged.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>&lt;api_prefix&gt;</code> is the base url of the API you wish to reverse-engineer. You will need to obtain it by observing the requests being made in mitmproxy.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example if an app has made requests like these:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="https://api.example.com/v1/login
https://api.example.com/v1/users/2
https://api.example.com/v1/users/2/profile"><pre><span>https://api.example.com/v1/login</span>
<span>https://api.example.com/v1/users/2</span>
<span>https://api.example.com/v1/users/2/profile</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The likely prefix is <code>https://api.example.com/v1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Running the first pass should have created a section in the schema file like this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="x-path-templates:
  # Remove the ignore: prefix to generate an endpoint with its URL
  # Lines that are closer to the top take precedence, the matching is greedy
  - ignore:/addresses
  - ignore:/basket
  - ignore:/basket/add
  - ignore:/basket/checkouts
  - ignore:/basket/coupons/attach/{id}
  - ignore:/basket/coupons/attach/104754"><pre><span>x-path-templates</span>:
  <span><span>#</span> Remove the ignore: prefix to generate an endpoint with its URL</span>
  <span><span>#</span> Lines that are closer to the top take precedence, the matching is greedy</span>
  - <span>ignore:/addresses</span>
  - <span>ignore:/basket</span>
  - <span>ignore:/basket/add</span>
  - <span>ignore:/basket/checkouts</span>
  - <span>ignore:/basket/coupons/attach/{id}</span>
  - <span>ignore:/basket/coupons/attach/104754</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You should edit the schema file with a text editor and remove the <code>ignore:</code> prefix from the paths you wish to be generated. You can also adjust the parameters appearing in the paths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Run the second pass of mitmproxy2swagger:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ mitmproxy2swagger -i <path_to_mitmptoxy_flow> -o <path_to_output_schema> -p <api_prefix> [--examples]
# ... or ...
$ docker run -it -v $PWD:/app mitmproxy2swagger mitmproxy2swagger -i <path_to_mitmptoxy_flow> -o <path_to_output_schema> -p <api_prefix> [--examples]"><pre>$ mitmproxy2swagger -i <span>&lt;</span>path_to_mitmptoxy_flow<span>&gt;</span> -o <span>&lt;</span>path_to_output_schema<span>&gt;</span> -p <span>&lt;</span>api_prefix<span>&gt;</span> [--examples]
<span><span>#</span> ... or ...</span>
$ docker run -it -v <span>$PWD</span>:/app mitmproxy2swagger mitmproxy2swagger -i <span>&lt;</span>path_to_mitmptoxy_flow<span>&gt;</span> -o <span>&lt;</span>path_to_output_schema<span>&gt;</span> -p <span>&lt;</span>api_prefix<span>&gt;</span> [--examples]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Run the command a second time (with the same schema file). It will pick up the edited lines and generate endpoint descriptions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please note that mitmproxy2swagger will not overwrite existing endpoint descriptions, if you want to overwrite them, you can delete them before running the second pass.</p>
<p dir="auto">Passing <code>--examples</code> will add example data to requests and responses. Take caution when using this option, as it may add sensitive data (tokens, passwords, personal information etc.) to the schema.
Passing <code>--headers</code> will add headers data to requests and responses. Take caution when using this option, as it may add sensitive data (tokens, passwords, personal information etc.) to the schema.</p>

Generating Pixels with Multiple Samples
----------------------------------------
For a single pixel composed of multiple samples, we'll select samples from the area surrounding the
pixel and average the resulting light (color) values together.

First we'll update the `write_color()` function to account for the number of samples we use: we need
to find the average across all of the samples that we take. To do this, we'll add the full color
from each iteration, and then finish with a single division (by the number of samples) at the end,
before writing out the color. To ensure that the color components of the final result remain within
the proper $[0,1]$ bounds, we'll add and use a small helper function: `interval::clamp(x)`.

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    class interval {
      public:
        ...

        bool surrounds(double x) const {

Diffuse Materials
====================================================================================================
Now that we have objects and multiple rays per pixel, we can make some realistic looking materials.
We‚Äôll start with diffuse materials (also called _matte_). One question is whether we mix and match
geometry and materials (so that we can assign a material to multiple spheres, or vice versa) or if
geometry and materials are tightly bound (which could be useful for procedural objects where the
geometry and material are linked). We‚Äôll go with separate -- which is usual in most renderers -- but
do be aware that there are alternative approaches.

A Simple Diffuse Material
--------------------------
Diffuse objects that don‚Äôt emit their own light merely take on the color of their surroundings, but
they do modulate that with their own intrinsic color. Light that reflects off a diffuse surface has
its direction randomized, so, if we send three rays into a crack between two diffuse surfaces they
will each have different random behavior:

  ![Figure [light-bounce]: Light ray bounces](../images/fig-1.09-light-bounce.jpg)

They might also be absorbed rather than reflected. The darker the surface, the more likely the ray
is absorbed (that‚Äôs why it's dark!). Really any algorithm that randomizes direction will produce
surfaces that look matte. Let's start with the most intuitive: a surface that randomly bounces a ray
equally in all directions. For this material, a ray that hits the surface has an equal probability
of bouncing in any direction away from the surface.

  ![Figure [random-vec-hor]: Equal reflection above the horizon
  ](../images/fig-1.10-random-vec-horizon.jpg)

This very intuitive material is the simplest kind of diffuse and -- indeed -- many of the first
raytracing papers used this diffuse method (before adopting a more accurate method that we'll be
implementing a little bit later). We don't currently have a way to randomly reflect a ray, so we'll
need to add a few functions to our vector utility header. The first thing we need is the ability to
generate arbitrary random vectors:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    class vec3 {
      public:
        ...

        double length_squared() const {
            return e[0]*e[0] + e[1]*e[1] + e[2]*e[2];
        }


    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++ highlight
        static vec3 random() {
            return vec3(random_double(), random_double(), random_double());
        }

        static vec3 random(double min, double max) {
            return vec3(random_double(min,max), random_double(min,max), random_double(min,max));
        }
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    };
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    [Listing [vec-rand-util]: <kbd>[vec3.h]</kbd> vec3 random utility functions]

Then we need to figure out how to manipulate a random vector so that we only get results that are on
the surface of a hemisphere. There are analytical methods of doing this, but they are actually
surprisingly complicated to understand, and quite a bit complicated to implement. Instead, we'll use
what is typically the easiest algorithm: A rejection method. A rejection method works by repeatedly
generating random samples until we produce a sample that meets the desired criteria. In other words,
keep rejecting bad samples until you find a good one.

There are many equally valid ways of generating a random vector on a hemisphere using the rejection
method, but for our purposes we will go with the simplest, which is:

1. Generate a random vector inside the unit sphere
2. Normalize this vector to extend it to the sphere surface
3. Invert the normalized vector if it falls onto the wrong hemisphere

<p>
First, we will use a rejection method to generate the random vector inside the unit sphere (that is,
a sphere of radius 1). Pick a random point inside the cube enclosing the unit sphere (that is, where
$x$, $y$, and $z$ are all in the range $[-1,+1]$). If this point lies outside the unit
sphere, then generate a new one until we find one that lies inside or on the unit sphere.

  ![Figure [sphere-vec]: Two vectors were rejected before finding a good one (pre-normalization)

  ![Figure [sphere-vec]: The accepted random vector is normalized to produce a unit vector
  ](../images/fig-1.12-sphere-unit-vec.jpg)

Here's our first draft of the function:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    ...

    inline vec3 unit_vector(const vec3&amp; v) {
        return v / v.length();
    }


    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++ highlight
    inline vec3 random_unit_vector() {
        while (true) {
            auto p = vec3::random(-1,1);
            auto lensq = p.length_squared();
            if (lensq &lt;= 1)
                return p / sqrt(lensq);
        }
    }
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    [Listing [random-in-unit-sphere]: <kbd>[vec3.h]</kbd> The random_unit_vector() function, version one]

</p>

Sadly, we have a small floating-point abstraction leak to deal with. Since floating-point numbers
have finite precision, a very small value can underflow to zero when squared. So if all three
coordinates are small enough (that is, very near the center of the sphere), the norm of the vector
will be zero, and thus normalizing will yield the bogus vector $[\pm\infty, \pm\infty, \pm\infty]$.
To fix this, we'll also reject points that lie inside this "black hole" around the center. With
double precision (64-bit floats), we can safely support values greater than $10^{-160}$.

Here's our more robust function:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    inline vec3 random_unit_vector() {
        while (true) {
            auto p = vec3::random(-1,1);
            auto lensq = p.length_squared();

    }

    [Listing [random-in-unit-sphere]: <kbd>[vec3.h]</kbd> The random_unit_vector() function, version one]

<p>
Now that we have a random vector on the surface of the unit sphere, we can determine if it is on the
correct hemisphere by comparing against the surface normal:

  ![Figure [normal-hor]: The normal vector tells us which hemisphere we need
  ](../images/fig-1.13-surface-normal.jpg)

</p>

<p>
We can take the dot product of the surface normal and our random vector to determine if it's in the
correct hemisphere. If the dot product is positive, then the vector is in the correct hemisphere. If
the dot product is negative, then we need to invert the vector.

If a ray bounces off of a material and keeps 100% of its color, then we say that the material is
_white_. If a ray bounces off of a material and keeps 0% of its color, then we say that the material
is black. As a first demonstration of our new diffuse material we'll set the `ray_color` function to
return 50% of the color from a bounce. We should expect to get a nice gray color.

There's one potential problem lurking here. Notice that the `ray_color` function is recursive. When

Fixing Shadow Acne
-------------------
There‚Äôs also a subtle bug that we need to address. A ray will attempt to accurately calculate the
intersection point when it intersects with a surface. Unfortunately for us, this calculation is
susceptible to floating point rounding errors which can cause the intersection point to be ever so
slightly off. This means that the origin of the next ray, the ray that is randomly scattered off of
the surface, is unlikely to be perfectly flush with the surface. It might be just above the surface.
It might be just below the surface. If the ray's origin is just below the surface then it could
intersect with that surface again. Which means that it will find the nearest surface at
$t=0.00000001$ or whatever floating point approximation the hit function gives us. The simplest hack
to address this is just to ignore hits that are very close to the calculated intersection point:

True Lambertian Reflection
---------------------------
Scattering reflected rays evenly about the hemisphere produces a nice soft diffuse model, but we can
definitely do better. A more accurate representation of real diffuse objects is the _Lambertian_
distribution. This distribution scatters reflected rays in a manner that is proportional to $\cos
(\phi)$, where $\phi$ is the angle between the reflected ray and the surface normal. This means that
a reflected ray is most likely to scatter in a direction near the surface normal, and less likely to
scatter in directions away from the normal. This non-uniform Lambertian distribution does a better
job of modeling material reflection in the real world than our previous uniform scattering.

We can create this distribution by adding a random unit vector to the normal vector. At the point of
intersection on a surface there is the hit point, $\mathbf{p}$, and there is the normal of the
surface, $\mathbf{n}$. At the point of intersection, this surface has exactly two sides, so there
can only be two unique unit spheres tangent to any intersection point (one unique sphere for each
side of the surface). These two unit spheres will be displaced from the surface by the length of
their radius, which is exactly one for a unit sphere.

One sphere will be displaced in the direction of the surface's normal ($\mathbf{n}$) and one sphere
will be displaced in the opposite direction ($\mathbf{-n}$). This leaves us with two spheres of unit
size that will only be _just_ touching the surface at the intersection point. From this, one of the
spheres will have its center at $(\mathbf{P} + \mathbf{n})$ and the other sphere will have its
center at $(\mathbf{P} - \mathbf{n})$. The sphere with a center at $(\mathbf{P} - \mathbf{n})$ is
considered _inside_ the surface, whereas the sphere with center $(\mathbf{P} + \mathbf{n})$ is
considered _outside_ the surface.

We want to select the tangent unit sphere that is on the same side of the surface as the ray origin.
Pick a random point $\mathbf{S}$ on this unit radius sphere and send a ray from the hit point
$\mathbf{P}$ to the random point $\mathbf{S}$ (this is the vector $(\mathbf{S}-\mathbf{P})$):

</p>

It's hard to tell the difference between these two diffuse methods, given that our scene of two
spheres is so simple, but you should be able to notice two important visual differences:

  1. The shadows are more pronounced after the change
  2. Both spheres are tinted blue from the sky after the change

Both of these changes are due to the less uniform scattering of the light rays--more rays are
scattering toward the normal. This means that for diffuse objects, they will appear _darker_ because
less light bounces toward the camera. For the shadows, more light bounces straight-up, so the area
underneath the sphere is darker.

Not a lot of common, everyday objects are perfectly diffuse, so our visual intuition of how these
objects behave under light can be poorly formed. As scenes become more complicated over the course
of the book, you are encouraged to switch between the different diffuse renderers presented here.
Most scenes of interest will contain a large amount of diffuse materials. You can gain valuable
insight by understanding the effect of different diffuse methods on the lighting of a scene.


Using Gamma Correction for Accurate Color Intensity
----------------------------------------------------
Note the shadowing under the sphere. The picture is very dark, but our spheres only absorb half the
energy of each bounce, so they are 50% reflectors. The spheres should look pretty bright (in real
life, a light grey) but they appear to be rather dark. We can see this more clearly if we walk
through the full brightness gamut for our diffuse material. We start by setting the reflectance of
the `ray_color` function from `0.5` (50%) to `0.1` (10%):

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    class camera {
        ...

            return (1.0-a)*color(1.0, 1.0, 1.0) + a*color(0.5, 0.7, 1.0);
        }

    [Listing [ray-color-gamut]: <kbd>[camera.h]</kbd> ray_color() with 10% reflectance]

We render out at this new 10% reflectance. We then set reflectance to 30% and render again. We
repeat for 50%, 70%, and finally 90%. You can overlay these images from left to right in the photo
editor of your choice and you should get a very nice visual representation of the increasing
brightness of your chosen gamut. This is the one that we've been working with so far: 

![<span>Image 11:</span> The gamut of our renderer so far
](../images/img-1.11-linear-gamut.png class='pixel')

If you look closely, or if you use a color picker, you should notice that the 50% reflectance render
(the one in the middle) is far too dark to be half-way between white and black (middle-gray).
Indeed, the 70% reflector is closer to middle-gray. The reason for this is that almost all computer
programs assume that an image is ‚Äúgamma corrected‚Äù before being written into an image file. This
means that the 0 to 1 values have some transform applied before being stored as a byte. Images with
data that are written without being transformed are said to be in _linear space_, whereas images
that are transformed are said to be in _gamma space_. It is likely that the image viewer you are
using is expecting an image in gamma space, but we are giving it an image in linear space. This is
the reason why our image appears inaccurately dark.

There are many good reasons for why images should be stored in gamma space, but for our purposes we
just need to be aware of it. We are going to transform our data into gamma space so that our image
viewer can more accurately display our image. As a simple approximation, we can use ‚Äúgamma 2‚Äù as our
transform, which is the power that you use when going from gamma space to linear space. We need to
go from linear space to gamma space, which means taking the inverse of "gamma 2", which means an
exponent of $1/\mathit{gamma}$, which is just the square-root. We'll also want to ensure that we
robustly handle negative inputs.

Metal
====================================================================================================

An Abstract Class for Materials
--------------------------------
If we want different objects to have different materials, we have a design decision. We could have a
universal material type with lots of parameters so any individual material type could just ignore
the parameters that don't affect it. This is not a bad approach. Or we could have an abstract
material class that encapsulates unique behavior. I am a fan of the latter approach. For our program
the material needs to do two things:

  1. Produce a scattered ray (or say it absorbed the incident ray).
  2. If scattered, say how much the ray should be attenuated.

<p>
This suggests the abstract class:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    #ifndef MATERIAL_H
    #define MATERIAL_H

    #include "hittable.h"

    class material {
      public:

        virtual bool scatter(
            const ray&amp; r_in, const hit_record&amp; rec, color&amp; attenuation, ray&amp; scattered
        ) const {
            return false;
        }
    };

A Data Structure to Describe Ray-Object Intersections
------------------------------------------------------
The `hit_record` is to avoid a bunch of arguments so we can stuff whatever info we want in there.
You can use arguments instead of an encapsulated type, it‚Äôs just a matter of taste. Hittables and
materials need to be able to reference the other's type in code so there is some circularity of the
references. In C++ we add the line `class material;` to tell the compiler that `material` is a class
that will be defined later. Since we're just specifying a pointer to the class, the compiler doesn't
need to know the details of the class, solving the circular reference issue.

    };

    [Listing [hit-with-material]: <kbd>[hittable.h]</kbd> Hit record with added material pointer]

`hit_record` is just a way to stuff a bunch of arguments into a class so we can send them as a
group. When a ray hits a surface (a particular sphere for example), the material pointer in the
`hit_record` will be set to point at the material pointer the sphere was given when it was set up in
`main()` when we start. When the `ray_color()` routine gets the `hit_record` it can call member
functions of the material pointer to find out what ray, if any, is scattered.

Modeling Light Scatter and Reflectance
---------------------------------------
Here and throughout these books we will use the term _albedo_ (Latin for "whiteness"). Albedo is a
precise technical term in some disciplines, but in all cases it is used to define some form of
_fractional reflectance_. Albedo will vary with material color and (as we will later implement for
glass materials) can also vary with incident viewing direction (the direction of the incoming ray).

Lambertian (diffuse) reflectance can either always scatter and attenuate light according to its
reflectance $R$, or it can sometimes scatter (with probability $1-R$) with no attenuation (where a
ray that isn't scattered is just absorbed into the material). It could also be a mixture of both
those strategies. We will choose to always scatter, so implementing Lambertian materials becomes a
simple task:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    class material {
        ...
    };


    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++ highlight
    class lambertian : public material {
      public:
        lambertian(const color&amp; albedo) : albedo(albedo) {}

        bool scatter(const ray&amp; r_in, const hit_record&amp; rec, color&amp; attenuation, ray&amp; scattered)
        const override {
            auto scatter_direction = rec.normal + random_unit_vector();
            scattered = ray(rec.p, scatter_direction);
            attenuation = albedo;
            return true;
        }

      private:
        color albedo;
    };
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    [Listing [lambertian-initial]: <kbd>[material.h]</kbd> The new lambertian material class]

Note the third option: we could scatter with some fixed probability $p$ and have attenuation be
$\mathit{albedo}/p$. Your choice.

If you read the code above carefully, you'll notice a small chance of mischief. If the random unit
vector we generate is exactly opposite the normal vector, the two will sum to zero, which will
result in a zero scatter direction vector. This leads to bad scenarios later on (infinities and
NaNs), so we need to intercept the condition before we pass it on.

In service of this, we'll create a new vector method -- `vec3::near_zero()` -- that returns true if
the vector is very close to zero in all dimensions.

The following changes will use the C++ standard library function `std::fabs`, which returns the
absolute value of its input.

Mirrored Light Reflection
--------------------------
For polished metals the ray won‚Äôt be randomly scattered. The key question is: How does a ray get
reflected from a metal mirror? Vector math is our friend here:

  ![Figure [reflection]: Ray reflection](../images/fig-1.15-reflection.jpg)

The reflected ray direction in red is just $\mathbf{v} + 2\mathbf{b}$. In our design, $\mathbf{n}$
is a unit vector (length one), but $\mathbf{v}$ may not be. To get the vector $\mathbf{b}$, we scale
the normal vector by the length of the projection of $\mathbf{v}$ onto $\mathbf{n}$, which is given
by the dot product $\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n}$. (If $\mathbf{n}$ were not a unit vector, we would
also need to divide this dot product by the length of $\mathbf{n}$.) Finally, because $\mathbf{v}$
points _into_ the surface, and we want $\mathbf{b}$ to point _out_ of the surface, we need to negate
this projection length.

Putting everything together, we get the following computation of the reflected vector:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++

        ...

Fuzzy Reflection
-----------------
We can also randomize the reflected direction by using a small sphere and choosing a new endpoint
for the ray. We'll use a random point from the surface of a sphere centered on the original
endpoint, scaled by the fuzz factor.

  ![Figure [reflect-fuzzy]: Generating fuzzed reflection rays](../images/fig-1.16-reflect-fuzzy.jpg)

The bigger the fuzz sphere, the fuzzier the reflections will be. This suggests adding a fuzziness
parameter that is just the radius of the sphere (so zero is no perturbation). The catch is that for
big spheres or grazing rays, we may scatter below the surface. We can just have the surface absorb
those.

Also note that in order for the fuzz sphere to make sense, it needs to be consistently scaled
compared to the reflection vector, which can vary in length arbitrarily. To address this, we need to
normalize the reflected ray.

Dielectrics
====================================================================================================
Clear materials such as water, glass, and diamond are dielectrics. When a light ray hits them, it
splits into a reflected ray and a refracted (transmitted) ray. We‚Äôll handle that by randomly
choosing between reflection and refraction, only generating one scattered ray per interaction.

As a quick review of terms, a _reflected_ ray hits a surface and then "bounces" off in a new
direction.

A _refracted_ ray bends as it transitions from a material's surroundings into the material itself
(as with glass or water). This is why a pencil looks bent when partially inserted in water.

The amount that a refracted ray bends is determined by the material's _refractive index_. Generally,
this is a single value that describes how much light bends when entering a material from a vacuum.
Glass has a refractive index of something like 1.5‚Äì1.7, diamond is around 2.4, and air has a
small refractive index of 1.000293.

When a transparent material is embedded in a different transparent material, you can describe the
refraction with a relative refraction index: the refractive index of the object's material divided
by the refractive index of the surrounding material. For example, if you want to render a glass ball
under water, then the glass ball would have an effective refractive index of 1.125. This is given by
the refractive index of glass (1.5) divided by the refractive index of water (1.333).

You can find the refractive index of most common materials with a quick internet search.


Refraction
-----------
The hardest part to debug is the refracted ray. I usually first just have all the light refract if
there is a refraction ray at all. For this project, I tried to put two glass balls in our scene, and
I got this (I have not told you how to do this right or wrong yet, but soon!):

  ![<span>Image 15:</span> Glass first
  ](../images/img-1.15-glass-first.png class='pixel')

Is that right? Glass balls look odd in real life. But no, it isn‚Äôt right. The world should be
flipped upside down and no weird black stuff. I just printed out the ray straight through the middle
of the image and it was clearly wrong. That often does the job.


Snell's Law
------------
The refraction is described by Snell‚Äôs law:

  $$ \eta \cdot \sin\theta = \eta' \cdot \sin\theta' $$

Where $\theta$ and $\theta'$ are the angles from the normal, and $\eta$ and $\eta'$ (pronounced
"eta" and "eta prime") are the refractive indices. The geometry is:

  ![Figure [refraction]: Ray refraction](../images/fig-1.17-refraction.jpg)

In order to determine the direction of the refracted ray, we have to solve for $\sin\theta'$:

  $$ \sin\theta' = \frac{\eta}{\eta'} \cdot \sin\theta $$

On the refracted side of the surface there is a refracted ray $\mathbf{R'}$ and a normal
$\mathbf{n'}$, and there exists an angle, $\theta'$, between them. We can split $\mathbf{R'}$ into
the parts of the ray that are perpendicular to $\mathbf{n'}$ and parallel to $\mathbf{n'}$:

  $$ \mathbf{R'} = \mathbf{R'}_{\bot} + \mathbf{R'}_{\parallel} $$

If we solve for $\mathbf{R'}_{\bot}$ and $\mathbf{R'}_{\parallel}$ we get:

  $$ \mathbf{R'}_{\bot} = \frac{\eta}{\eta'} (\mathbf{R} + \cos\theta \mathbf{n}) $$
  $$ \mathbf{R'}_{\parallel} = -\sqrt{1 - |\mathbf{R'}_{\bot}|^2} \mathbf{n} $$

You can go ahead and prove this for yourself if you want, but we will treat it as fact and move on.
The rest of the book will not require you to understand the proof.

We know the value of every term on the right-hand side except for $\cos\theta$. It is well known
that the dot product of two vectors can be explained in terms of the cosine of the angle between
them:

  $$ \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = |\mathbf{a}| |\mathbf{b}| \cos\theta $$

If we restrict $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ to be unit vectors:

  $$ \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \cos\theta $$

We can now rewrite $\mathbf{R'}_{\bot}$ in terms of known quantities:

  $$ \mathbf{R'}_{\bot} =
     \frac{\eta}{\eta'} (\mathbf{R} + (\mathbf{-R} \cdot \mathbf{n}) \mathbf{n}) $$

<p>
When we combine them back together, we can write a function to calculate $\mathbf{R'}$:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    ...

    inline vec3 reflect(const vec3&amp; v, const vec3&amp; n) {
        return v - 2*dot(v,n)*n;

        vec3 r_out_perp =  etai_over_etat * (uv + cos_theta*n);
        vec3 r_out_parallel = -std::sqrt(std::fabs(1.0 - r_out_perp.length_squared())) * n;
        return r_out_perp + r_out_parallel;

Total Internal Reflection
--------------------------
One troublesome practical issue with refraction is that there are ray angles for which no solution
is possible using Snell's law. When a ray enters a medium of lower index of refraction at a
sufficiently glancing angle, it can refract with an angle greater than 90¬∞. If we refer back to
Snell's law and the derivation of $\sin\theta'$:

  $$ \sin\theta' = \frac{\eta}{\eta'} \cdot \sin\theta $$

If the ray is inside glass and outside is air ($\eta = 1.5$ and $\eta' = 1.0$):

  $$ \sin\theta' = \frac{1.5}{1.0} \cdot \sin\theta $$

<p>
The value of $\sin\theta'$ cannot be greater than 1. So, if,

  $$ \frac{1.5}{1.0} \cdot \sin\theta &gt; 1.0 $$

the equality between the two sides of the equation is broken, and a solution cannot exist. If a
solution does not exist, the glass cannot refract, and therefore must reflect the ray:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
    if (ri * sin_theta &gt; 1.0) {
        // Must Reflect
        ...
    } else {
        // Can Refract
        ...
    }
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    [Listing [dielectric-can-refract-1]: <kbd>[material.h]</kbd> Determining if the ray can refract]

</p>

Here all the light is reflected, and because in practice that is usually inside solid objects, it is
called _total internal reflection_. This is why sometimes the water-to-air boundary acts as a
perfect mirror when you are submerged -- if you're under water looking up, you can see things above
the water, but when you are close to the surface and looking sideways, the water surface looks like
a mirror.

We can solve for `sin_theta` using the trigonometric qualities:

  $$ \sin\theta  = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2\theta} $$

and

  $$ \cos\theta = \mathbf{R} \cdot \mathbf{n} $$

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++

Attenuation is always 1 -- the glass surface absorbs nothing.

If we render the prior scene with the new `dielectric::scatter()` function, we see ‚Ä¶ no change. Huh?

Well, it turns out that given a sphere of material with an index of refraction greater than air,
there's no incident angle that will yield total internal reflection -- neither at the ray-sphere
entrance point nor at the ray exit. This is due to the geometry of spheres, as a grazing incoming
ray will always be bent to a smaller angle, and then bent back to the original angle on exit.

So how can we illustrate total internal reflection? Well, if the sphere has an index of refraction
_less_ than the medium it's in, then we can hit it with shallow grazing angles, getting total
_external_ reflection. That should be good enough to observe the effect.

We'll model a world filled with water (index of refraction approximately 1.33), and change the
sphere material to air (index of refraction 1.00) -- an air bubble! To do this, change the left
sphere material's index of refraction to

  $$\frac{\text{index of refraction of air}}{\text{index of refraction of water}}$$

Modeling a Hollow Glass Sphere
-------------------------------
Let's model a hollow glass sphere. This is a sphere of some thickness with another sphere of air
inside it. If you think about the path of a ray going through such an object, it will hit the outer
sphere, refract, hit the inner sphere (assuming we do hit it), refract a second time, and travel
through the air inside. Then it will continue on, hit the inside surface of the inner sphere,
refract back, then hit the inside surface of the outer sphere, and finally refract and exit back
into the scene atmosphere.

The outer sphere is just modeled with a standard glass sphere, with a refractive index of around
1.50 (modeling a refraction from the outside air into glass). The inner sphere is a bit different
because _its_ refractive index should be relative to the material of the surrounding outer sphere,
thus modeling a transition from glass into the inner air.

This is actually simple to specify, as the `refraction_index` parameter to the dielectric material
can be interpreted as the _ratio_ of the refractive index of the object divided by the refractive
index of the enclosing medium. In this case, the inner sphere would have an refractive index of air
(the inner sphere material) over the index of refraction of glass (the enclosing medium), or
$1.00/1.50 = 0.67$.

Here's the code:

Positionable Camera
====================================================================================================
Cameras, like dielectrics, are a pain to debug, so I always develop mine incrementally. First, let‚Äôs
allow for an adjustable field of view (_fov_). This is the visual angle from edge to edge of the
rendered image. Since our image is not square, the fov is different horizontally and vertically. I
always use vertical fov. I also usually specify it in degrees and change to radians inside a
constructor -- a matter of personal taste.


Camera Viewing Geometry
------------------------
First, we'll keep the rays coming from the origin and heading to the $z = -1$ plane. We could make
it the $z = -2$ plane, or whatever, as long as we made $h$ a ratio to that distance. Here is our
setup:

Positioning and Orienting the Camera
-------------------------------------
To get an arbitrary viewpoint, let‚Äôs first name the points we care about. We‚Äôll call the position
where we place the camera _lookfrom_, and the point we look at _lookat_. (Later, if you want, you
could define a direction to look in instead of a point to look at.)

We also need a way to specify the roll, or sideways tilt, of the camera: the rotation around the
lookat-lookfrom axis. Another way to think about it is that even if you keep `lookfrom` and `lookat`
constant, you can still rotate your head around your nose. What we need is a way to specify an ‚Äúup‚Äù
vector for the camera.

  ![Figure [cam-view-dir]: Camera view direction](../images/fig-1.19-cam-view-dir.jpg)

We can specify any up vector we want, as long as it's not parallel to the view direction. Project
this up vector onto the plane orthogonal to the view direction to get a camera-relative up vector. I
use the common convention of naming this the ‚Äúview up‚Äù (_vup_) vector. After a few cross products
and vector normalizations, we now have a complete orthonormal basis $(u,v,w)$ to describe our
camera‚Äôs orientation. $u$ will be the unit vector pointing to camera right, $v$ is the unit vector
pointing to camera up, $w$ is the unit vector pointing opposite the view direction (since we use
right-hand coordinates), and the camera center is at the origin.

  ![Figure [cam-view-up]: Camera view up direction](../images/fig-1.20-cam-view-up.jpg)

Like before, when our fixed camera faced $-Z$, our arbitrary view camera faces $-w$. Keep in mind
that we can -- but we don‚Äôt have to -- use world up $(0,1,0)$ to specify vup. This is convenient and
will naturally keep your camera horizontally level until you decide to experiment with crazy camera
angles.

Defocus Blur
====================================================================================================
Now our final feature: _defocus blur_. Note, photographers call this _depth of field_, so be sure to
only use the term _defocus blur_ among your raytracing friends.

The reason we have defocus blur in real cameras is because they need a big hole (rather than just a
pinhole) through which to gather light. A large hole would defocus everything, but if we stick a
lens in front of the film/sensor, there will be a certain distance at which everything is in focus.
Objects placed at that distance will appear in focus and will linearly appear blurrier the further
they are from that distance. You can think of a lens this way: all light rays coming _from_ a
specific point at the focus distance -- and that hit the lens -- will be bent back _to_ a single
point on the image sensor.

We call the distance between the camera center and the plane where everything is in perfect focus
the _focus distance_. Be aware that the focus distance is not usually the same as the focal length
-- the _focal length_ is the distance between the camera center and the image plane. For our model,
however, these two will have the same value, as we will put our pixel grid right on the focus plane,
which is _focus distance_ away from the camera center.

In a physical camera, the focus distance is controlled by the distance between the lens and the
film/sensor. That is why you see the lens move relative to the camera when you change what is in
focus (that may happen in your phone camera too, but the sensor moves). The ‚Äúaperture‚Äù is a hole to
control how big the lens is effectively. For a real camera, if you need more light you make the
aperture bigger, and will get more blur for objects away from the focus distance. For our virtual
camera, we can have a perfect sensor and never need more light, so we only use an aperture when we
want defocus blur.


A Thin Lens Approximation
--------------------------
A real camera has a complicated compound lens. For our code, we could simulate the order: sensor,
then lens, then aperture. Then we could figure out where to send the rays, and flip the image after
it's computed (the image is projected upside down on the film). Graphics people, however, usually
use a thin lens approximation:

  ![Figure [cam-lens]: Camera lens model](../images/fig-1.21-cam-lens.jpg)

We don‚Äôt need to simulate any of the inside of the camera -- for the purposes of rendering an image
outside the camera, that would be unnecessary complexity. Instead, I usually start rays from an
infinitely thin circular "lens", and send them toward the pixel of interest on the focus plane
(`focal_length` away from the lens), where everything on that plane in the 3D world is in perfect
focus.

In practice, we accomplish this by placing the viewport in this plane. Putting everything together:

  1. The focus plane is orthogonal to the camera view direction.
  2. The focus distance is the distance between the camera center and the focus plane.
  3. The viewport lies on the focus plane, centered on the camera view direction vector.
  4. The grid of pixel locations lies inside the viewport (located in the 3D world).
  5. Random image sample locations are chosen from the region around the current pixel location.
  6. The camera fires rays from random points on the lens through the current image sample location.

  ![Figure [cam-film-plane]: Camera focus plane](../images/fig-1.22-cam-film-plane.jpg)


Generating Sample Rays
-----------------------
Without defocus blur, all scene rays originate from the camera center (or `lookfrom`). In order to
accomplish defocus blur, we construct a disk centered at the camera center. The larger the radius,
the greater the defocus blur. You can think of our original camera as having a defocus disk of
radius zero (no blur at all), so all rays originated at the disk center (`lookfrom`).

So, how large should the defocus disk be? Since the size of this disk controls how much defocus blur
we get, that should be a parameter of the camera class. We could just take the radius of the disk as
a camera parameter, but the blur would vary depending on the projection distance. A slightly easier
parameter is to specify the angle of the cone with apex at viewport center and base (defocus disk)
at the camera center. This should give you more consistent results as you vary the focus distance
for a given shot.

Since we'll be choosing random points from the defocus disk, we'll need a function to do that:
`random_in_unit_disk()`. This function works using the same kind of method we use in
`random_in_unit_sphere()`, just for two dimensions.

(Note that the code above differs slightly from the project sample code: the `samples_per_pixel` is
set to 500 above for a high-quality image that will take quite a while to render. The project source
code uses a value of 10 in the interest of reasonable run times while developing and validating.)

This gives:

</p>

An interesting thing you might note is the glass balls don‚Äôt really have shadows which makes them
look like they are floating. This is not a bug -- you don‚Äôt see glass balls much in real life, where
they also look a bit strange, and indeed seem to float on cloudy days. A point on the big sphere
under a glass ball still has lots of light hitting it because the sky is re-ordered rather than
blocked.


Next Steps
-----------
You now have a cool ray tracer! What next?


### Book 2: _Ray Tracing: The Next Week_
The second book in this series builds on the ray tracer you've developed here. This includes new
features such as:

  - Motion blur -- Realistically render moving objects.
  - Bounding volume hierarchies -- speeding up the rendering of complex scenes.
  - Texture maps -- placing images on objects.
  - Perlin noise -- a random noise generator very useful for many techniques.
  - Quadrilaterals -- something to render besides spheres! Also, the foundation to implement disks,
    triangles, rings or just about any other 2D primitive.
  - Lights -- add sources of light to your scene.
  - Transforms -- useful for placing and rotating objects.
  - Volumetric rendering -- render smoke, clouds and other gaseous volumes.


### Book 3: _Ray Tracing: The Rest of Your Life_
This book expands again on the content from the second book. A lot of this book is about improving
both the rendered image quality and the renderer performance, and focuses on generating the _right_
rays and accumulating them appropriately.

This book is for the reader seriously interested in writing professional-level ray tracers, and/or
interested in the foundation to implement advanced effects like subsurface scattering or nested
dielectrics.


### Other Directions
There are so many additional directions you can take from here, including techniques we haven't
(yet?) covered in this series. These include:

**Triangles** -- Most cool models are in triangle form. The model I/O is the worst and almost
everybody tries to get somebody else‚Äôs code to do this. This also includes efficiently handling
large _meshes_ of triangles, which present their own challenges.

**Parallelism** -- Run $N$ copies of your code on $N$ cores with different random seeds. Average the
$N$ runs. This averaging can also be done hierarchically where $N/2$ pairs can be averaged to get
$N/4$ images, and pairs of those can be averaged. That method of parallelism should extend well into
the thousands of cores with very little coding.

**Shadow Rays** -- When firing rays at light sources, you can determine exactly how a particular
point is shadowed. With this, you can render crisp or soft shadows, adding another degreee of
realism to your scenes.

Have fun, and please send me your cool images!

		<p>Happy Public Domain Day!</p>
		<p>Around the world, people celebrate Public Domain Day on January 1, the day in which copyright expires on some older works and they enter the public domain in many different countries.</p>
		<p>In the U.S. Constitution, copyright terms were meant to be very limited in order to ‚Äúpromote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.‚Äù The first copyright act, written in 1790 by the founding fathers themselves, set the term to be up to twenty-eight years.</p>
		<p>But since then, powerful corporations have repeatedly extended the length of copyright to promote not the progress of society, but their profit. The result is that today in the U.S., work only enters the public domain ninety-five years after publication‚Äîlocking our culture away for <em>nearly a century</em>.</p>
		<p>2019 was the year in which new works were finally scheduled to enter the public domain, ending this long, corporate-dictated cultural winter. And as that year drew closer, it became clear that these corporations <em>wouldn‚Äôt</em> try to extend copyright yet again‚Äîmaking it the first year in almost a century in which a significant amount of art and literature once again entered the U.S. public domain, free for anyone in the U.S. to read, use, share, remix, build upon, and enjoy.</p>
		<p>Ever since then, we‚Äôve been celebrating Public Domain Day by preparing some of the year‚Äôs biggest literary hits for you to read on January 1.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><strong>On January 1, 2025, books published in 1929 enter the U.S. public domain.</strong></p>
		<p>And 1929 was a literary doozy!</p>
		<p>Books by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-faulkner">William Faulkner</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ernest-hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>, <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mahatma-gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>, and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-steinbeck">John Steinbeck</a> enter the U.S. public domain. Joining these esteemed names is the English translation of <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/erich-maria-remarque/all-quiet-on-the-western-front/a-w-wheen">All Quiet on the Western Front</a></i>, the war novel so grisly that it was banned in parts of Europe; <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/dashiell-hammett/red-harvest">Red Harvest</a></i>, the first novel starring the <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/continental-op">Continental Op</a>, the hard-boiled noir detective who formed the archetype for every hard-drinking, fedora-wearing private eye to grace page and screen since; and much more.</p>
		<p>Our friends at the Public Domain Review have written about some <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/blog/2025/01/public-domain-day-2025/">other things that enter the public domain this year, too</a>.</p>
		<p>These past few months at Standard Ebooks, our volunteers have been working hard to prepare a selection of the books published in 1929 in advance of Public Domain Day. We‚Äôre excited to finally be able to share these <strong>20 new free ebooks</strong> with you!</p>

							</h2>
							
							<p>Faulkner‚Äôs widely-acclaimed masterpiece is well-known in America, as it‚Äôs taught in high schools across the country. In it we follow the Compson family, an aristocratic family in Mississippi, and their slow decline into poverty and ruin. What makes the novel so special‚Äîand what lends it its reputation as a challenging read‚Äîis its stream-of-consciousness style, in which Faulkner attempts to narrate the characters‚Äô thoughts directly to the reader.</p><p><i>The Sound and the Fury</i> was an essential step in developing that modernist prose style, and is still considered to be one of the greatest works of American literature.</p>

							</h2>
							<p>by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ernest-hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a></p>
							<p>Called ‚Äúthe premier American war novel from World War I,‚Äù Hemingway‚Äôs semi-autobiographical story of an American ambulance driver serving in the Italian front, and a bright and cynical British nurse, cemented his reputation as one of the generation‚Äôs foremost literary figures. Unlike Remarque, whose <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i> paints the war‚Äôs destruction in full color, Hemingway‚Äôs story is one of the mundanity of war‚Äîof the quotidian smallness that underpins even the most horrific of events.</p>

							</h2>
							<p>by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mahatma-gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a></p>
							<p>Mahatma Gandhi, father of the nation to post-colonial India, writes the story of his early life through 1921. He covers his childhood and his parents, his travels and his experiences with prejudice, how his interest in political activity and nonviolence developed throughout the years, and more. Despite this detailed treatment of his life, Gandhi asserts in the introduction that his purpose was not to write a ‚Äúreal autobiography,‚Äù but rather to ‚Äútell the story of my experiments with truth, and as my life consist of nothing but experiments.‚Äù</p>

							</h2>
							<p>by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-steinbeck">John Steinbeck</a></p>
							<p><i>Cup of Gold</i> is John Steinbeck‚Äôs first novel, the swashbuckling story of the real-life Captain Morgan, legendary pirate. Little of Morgan‚Äôs actual life is known, but Steinbeck fills in the blanks of this rich historical fiction with rich portraits of Caribbean ports and flourishes of magical realism.</p><p>While one might expect a rollicking tale of adventure, the novel is actually a deep meditation on the pursuit of‚Äîand inability to find‚Äîtrue happiness, and its skillful craft deftly foreshadows Steinbeck‚Äôs later ascension to literary titanhood.</p>

							<p>Samuel Dodsworth is a successful automobile executive who decides to retire early. His younger wife Fran wants to tour Europe, so the two embark on a trip. But soon after they arrive, Fran becomes enchanted by the whirlwind of culture and old-world society, while Samuel, a mild-mannered, down-to-earth Midwesterner, yearns to escape the pretentiousness and return to the quiet stability of home. The novel explores the slow breakdown of their marriage while deftly satirizing American middle-class mores and the wide gulf between them and European culture.</p>

							</h2>
							<p>by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-buchan">John Buchan</a></p>
							<p><i>The Courts of the Morning</i> opens with <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/richard-hannay">Major-General Richard Hannay</a> being approached by American diplomats regarding the disappearance of a wealthy industrialist. He in turn seeks the help of his friend Sandy Arbuthnot‚Äîbut Arbuthnot himself quickly goes missing. We soon head to the South American country of Olifa, where a powerful head of a mining company is gradually enslaving the populace. It seems that only guerrilla warfare will save the country from rule under a ruthless tyrant.</p>

							</h2>
							<p>by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a></p>
							<p>While investigating the deepest part of the Atlantic Ocean, a team led by Dr. Maracot is cut off from their ship and hurled to the bottom of the ocean. There, they find themselves in the remnants of the ancient civilization of Atlantis.</p><p>Though Doyle is most famous for his <a href="https://standardebooks.org/collections/sherlock-holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> stories, in which a brilliant logician uses reason and deduction to solve crime, in later years he became deeply spiritual. This novel, written just a year before his death, combines his interest in science and reason with his new spiritual outlook.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/">https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42572515">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="doc-container">
<h2>What‚Äôs a Career Framework?</h2>
<p>The Engineering Career Framework is your source for how to achieve impact for your role and team and how to grow in your engineering career. For managers, it can help you set expectations with your teams and hold them accountable for their work.</p>
<h2>What the Career Framework is not</h2>
<p>This framework is not a promotion checklist for your role; rather, it‚Äôs designed to help you figure out what your impact could look like at the next level.</p>
<p>This framework is not an exhaustive list of examples and behaviors; each responsibility includes three to four key behaviors that serve as guide for how to think about your work. Consequently, you‚Äôll need to meet with your manager to define your impact goals and align on the expectations for your role.</p>
<h2>What‚Äôs in a Career Framework?</h2>
<p>This framework is broken down into two components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level Expectations</strong> define the scope, collaborative reach, and levers for impact at every level; these expectations are the <em>what</em> that determines the difference between an IC3 and IC4, for example</li>
<li><strong>Core and Craft Responsibilities</strong> define the key behaviors specific to your role and team; these behaviors help you identify <em>how</em> you work to deliver impact based on your level expectations</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to navigate this framework</h2>
<p>Dropbox measures the success of its engineers largely on business impact. Anchor your work first and foremost on creating long-term impact. Since impact can be a bit vague, read <a href="https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/what_is_impact.html">What is Impact?</a></p>
<p>Next, ground yourself in the expectations for your level and team. For each level, you‚Äôll find a one-line summary description and the role‚Äôs scope, collaborative reach, and levers for impact.</p>
<p>Review the expected behaviors for that level across the Results, Direction, Talent, Culture pillars from the Core Responsibilities. Read your Craft expectations, which are the per discipline technical capabilities you need to master at that level. Finally, meet with your manager to set your goals for the quarter.</p>
