<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was having the Claude CLI clean up my packages in an old repo, and it nuked my whole Mac! What the hell? Has anyone ever had this happen? I’m trying to figure out if this is even reversible. So much work lost..</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/egjqmw80bv5g1.png?width=464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbec70edc4fcff42bebcf3c9cc04ec755fb4b10b">https://preview.redd.it/egjqmw80bv5g1.png?width=464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbec70edc4fcff42bebcf3c9cc04ec755fb4b10b</a></p>

<p>CLAUDE response - I found the problem and it's really bad. Looking at your log, here's the catastrophic command that was run:</p>

<p>bash</p>

<pre><code>rm -rf tests/ patches/ plan/ ~/
</code></pre>

<p>See that ~/ at the end? That's your entire home directory. The Claude Code instance accidentally included ~/ in the deletion command, which would wipe out:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your entire Desktop (~/Desktop)</li>
<li>Documents, Downloads, everything</li>
<li>Your Keychain (~/Library/Keychains)</li>
<li>Claude credentials (~/.claude)</li>
<li>Application support data</li>
<li>Basically everything in /Users/...</li>
</ul>

<p>This explains why:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your desktop is gone</li>
<li>Your keychain was deleted</li>
<li>Your Claude credentials disappeared</li>
<li>The error at the end says "current working directory was deleted"</li>
</ol>

    <p>Following in Amazon's footsteps, two student projects independently use 'collaborative filtering' to bring recommendations and social networking to online music; soon they will join forces.</p>
    <p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cybercultural.com/img/s7y_ZacaIh-1262.webp 1262w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1280px"><img loading="eager" decoding="async" src="https://cybercultural.com/img/s7y_ZacaIh-1262.jpeg" alt="Last.fm, 2003" width="1262" height="822"></picture>
<em>Last.fm circa 2003; via <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lastfm/2214547016/in/album-72157603783043503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last.fm Flickr account</a>.</em></p>
<p>What we now know as the “social web” — or <a href="https://cybercultural.com/web20/">Web 2.0</a> — didn’t arrive until <a href="https://cybercultural.com/p/003-the-first-web-20-conference-2004/">around 2004</a>. But the first inklings of it were emerging a couple of years before. As usual, music was the harbinger.</p>
<p>Last.fm was founded in 2002 by a group of four Austrian and German students from Ravensbourne College of Design and Communication in London. It was fashioned as an internet radio station that allowed a user to build a listening profile and share it with others. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030202060344/http://www.iamnotalone.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">year of its launch</a>, Last.fm won a young talent award <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021203235223/http://www.toptalents.at/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the Europrix</a>, a multimedia awards show based in Vienna. This was how the product was described in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030208055311/http://www.toptalents.at/top_talents/team01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a showcase video</a> (embedded below) leading up to the awards ceremony:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“After repeated use, the system builds a listening profile that increasingly reflects the user's preferences. The sum of all profiles is visualized in the ‘Map of Music,’ a presentation of musical connections and genres determined only by the collaborative effort of Last.fm users.”</p>
</blockquote>
  
<p>When the students went up to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPR_5nu0Wg0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receive their award</a>, one of them, Thomas Willomitzer, noted the importance of “collaborative filtering” to the Last.fm system. The idea was that the Last.fm algorithm would recommend music you might like, based on your listening history combined with the listening history of other, similar, users. Willomitzer added that this type of algorithm would be familiar to people who used Amazon.com.</p>
<p>Here's a video of the Last.fm founders presenting at Europrix 2002, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiJ0Z3k6Z0k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Thomas Willomitzer</a>:</p>
  
<p><a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/xerox/parc/techReports/CSL-92-10_Using_Collaborative_Filtering_to_Weave_an_Information_Tapestry.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collaborative filtering</a> was a common technique in recommender systems, and its history dated back to before the web — for instance, it was the basis for a 1992 Xerox PARC email system called ‘Tapestry.’ But collaborative filtering really came into its own during the web era, and in particular it was popularised by Amazon. By 2002, Amazon users were familiar with the following message: “Customers who bought items in your Shopping Cart also bought…” There was also a “Your Recommendations” list on the Amazon.com homepage. Both of these features were created using an algorithm that Amazon called “item-to-item collaborative filtering.” As explained in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1167344" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a research paper</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Rather than matching the user to similar customers, item-to-item collaborative filtering matches each of the user’s purchased and rated items to similar items, then combines those similar items into a recommendation list.”</p>
</blockquote>

<em>Amazon collaborative filtering examples; via research paper by Greg Linden, Brent Smith and Jeremy York, published by the IEEE Computer Society in January-February 2003 edition.</em></p>
<p>The key here is that <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/Amazon-Recommendations.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon’s collaborative filtering</a> was done based on the items people bought or rated, not the profiles of its users. This approach was also crucial to how new social web services like Last.fm would develop. The “map of music” that Last.fm created was all about mapping which songs (or genres) were interconnected — so a certain Bob Dylan song might have a strong connection to a certain Joni Mitchell song, based on listener data, and thus the Mitchell song might come up as a recommendation for people who listened to the Dylan song (and vice versa).</p>
<h2>Audioscrobbler</h2>
<p>By coincidence, another student in the UK was also working on a recommendation system for music in 2002. Audioscrobbler was started as a computer science project by Richard Jones at the University of Southampton. Jones coined the term “audioscrobbling" (later shortened to “scrobbling”) to describe the process of tracking songs that you listen to in order to make a listening profile, which is then used for recommendations.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cybercultural.com/img/P-viF2T9BI-690.webp 690w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1280px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cybercultural.com/img/P-viF2T9BI-690.jpeg" alt="Richard Jones Audioscrobbler" width="690" height="460"></picture>
<em>Richard Jones profile on University of Southampton website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040110153325/http://www.externalrelations.soton.ac.uk/media/0348.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 March 2003</a>.</em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031015001641/http://www.dolphin.soton.ac.uk/April2003/audioscrobbler.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an April 2003 interview</a> with his University’s paper, twenty-year old Jones explained how Audioscrobbler worked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Users of the system need to download software on to their computer that monitors what artists they listen to. The data is then collated and a pattern emerges by way of a technique known as ‘collaborative filtering.’ The results are then recorded against a username and can be compared with the listening tastes of other members.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, Jones would team up with the Ravensbourne College students and fold his project into Last.fm, but even in 2002 — when they were independent products — it is striking how similar the two systems were. Both used collaborative filtering to create song recommendations, and both aimed to create a kind of social network based around what users listened to.</p>

<h2>Escaping the Broadcast Model</h2>
<p>The key to the emerging social web would be that you discover new content and communities by <em>following other people</em>. For music, the idea was to help you break away from the established broadcast model. At the Europrix event, Last.fm’s Martin Stiksel brought out a 1980s-style transistor radio to illustrate the point. If you want to listen to music on such a device, Stiksel explained, you have to tune the frequency band to find your station. If you don’t like the music playing on that station, you tune the dial to another radio station and try your luck again.</p>
<p>“The inherent problem with broadcast media is that basically, at the end of the day, it's always somebody else selecting the music for you,” said Stiksel. “So there's always a bunch of editors or programmers that picked the music and put them into into a program for you.”</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cybercultural.com/img/jziW31p_lP-600.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1280px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cybercultural.com/img/jziW31p_lP-600.jpeg" alt="Last.fm and radio, 2002" width="600" height="460"></picture>
<em>Three Last.fm founders in 2002 with a transister radio, "from the 80s, I believe."</em></p>
<p>With Last.fm, the stream of music you heard was a mix of manual choice and algorithmic selection. You might start with a song already in your online “record collection” (the term Stiksel kept using), or start from another user’s profile. From then on, songs would be chosen for you based on collaborative filtering. If you played a song through, the Last.fm software automatically added it to your own collection. You could also press a “love” button to add it. But if you didn’t like a certain track, you could press a “hate” button (so it wouldn’t get played again), or click the “skip” button to move to the next song. There was also a “change” button to go to a different user profile.</p>
<p>The early Last.fm user interface was, in truth, a bit cluttered with all these different buttons and various search boxes — but over time it would get more streamlined.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cybercultural.com/img/Xiq6KcW_jY-1263.webp 1263w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1280px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cybercultural.com/img/Xiq6KcW_jY-1263.jpeg" alt="Last.fm circa November 2003" width="1263" height="819"></picture>
<em>Last.fm circa November 2003; <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lastfm/2214547020/in/album-72157603783043503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Flickr</a>.</em></p>
<p>Stiksel explained that the idea for Last.fm came about when the students asked themselves, “how do you look for something that you don't know?” So in the case of music, how to discover new music when you don’t necessarily know what type of music you’re looking for? The answer, he said, was the social component.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Then we figured out that it's the social aspect of music — the best music you always find when you go to your friend's house and he plays you records. And we’re taking this concept into an online environment here.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Value of User Data</h2>
<p>What both Last.fm and Audioscrobbler stumbled onto in 2002 was the collective value of user data in discovering new content — something that Amazon was also taking advantage of at this time. The problem with music, though, was that licensing from record companies was still highly restrictive. The Last.fm founders somewhat glossed over it during their Europrix presentation, but they did admit that “due to legal issues, we're only allowed to play 30 second samples.” Unless you already owned a piece of music, 30 seconds was all you got.</p>
<p>By the following year, however, Last.fm had begun turning itself into an "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031002073141/http://last.fm/labels.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online radio</a>" service, by paying licensing fees to the UK collecting societies PRS (Performing Right Society) and MCPS (Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society).</p>
<p>So pre-Web 2.0, the streaming revolution was only just getting started. But with Last.fm and Audioscrobbler, we at least glimpsed the future of the social web.</p>

The (superficially) controversial PR seemingly vindicated TypeScript skeptics/luddites (which at the time included figures like <a href="https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/#:~:text=TypeScript%2E%20I%20understand%20the%20concept%20of%20types%20and%20can%20read%20annotations%20but%20I%E2%80%99ve%20never%20written%20it%2E%20The%20few%20times%20I%20tried%2C%20I%20ran%20into%20difficulties">Dan Abramov</a> of the React team). The <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-web-frameworks-and-technologies">premier</a> darling of web frameworks ostensibly rejecting the benefits of static typing was a big deal.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> So Rich Harris felt compelled to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35892250">hop onto HN</a> and explain how this was "not a vindication of anti-Typescript positions".</p>
<p>Harris offered a considered take on why moving type declarations from .ts files to JSDoc comments in .js files was not an anti-TypeScript take. In fact, Harris asserted that Svelte's "commitment to TypeScript [was] stronger than ever."</p>
<p>This event heralded (and served as a citation for) a flood of "TypeScript VS JSDoc" blog posts and forum threads that offered the somewhat novel defense of JSDoc as "all the benefits of TypeScript without the build step" (albeit with a sometimes clunkier syntax).</p>
<p>But this is not the blog post lineage I hope to draw on with this post. Instead, I'd like to focus on a larger and more often misunderstood point. I take issue with the "vs" framing and offer a subtle but crucial substitution: JSDoc <em>is</em> TypeScript.</p>
<p>Some background:</p>
<h2 id="typescript-is-c">TypeScript is C#?</h2><p>(No, but it explains much of TS's early development)</p>
<p>Back in the late aughts/early 10s, JavaScript was still mostly seen as an unserious language. The tooling for JavaScript development lacked autocomplete, rename symbol, type safety, etc. Microsoft developers were so allergic to it that they would write C# code and use a tool called <a href="https://github.com/nikhilk/scriptsharp">ScriptSharp</a> to generate slightly-more-typesafe JavaScript code.</p>
<p>These are the origins of TypeScript.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> It is, fundamentally, a build tool to make writing JS less crappy. In fact:</p>
<h2 id="typescript-is-intellisense">TypeScript is IntelliSense!</h2><p>Even if you don't write your code in .ts files, you're probably using TypeScript. That's because TypeScript is the IntelliSense engine. Even if you're not using VSCode, if your editor gives you code completion, parameter info, quick info, member lists, etc. while writing JS code, you are almost certainly running the TypeScript language service.</p>
<h2 id="typescript-is-jsdoc">TypeScript is JSDoc :)</h2><p>It is also the TypeScript language service that is used to interpret JSDoc comments. That is why the TypeScript CHANGELOG often includes <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-5-5.html#the-jsdoc-import-tag">notes about JSDoc features</a>.<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> It also the reason your JSDoc-related IntelliSense can be governed by a <code>tsconfig.json</code> file and you can run <code>tsc</code> on a project typed with JSDoc comments.</p>
<p>You are already using TypeScript.</p>
<h2 id="my-own-experience">My Own Experience</h2><p>I recently rewrote the front-end for an old project of mine completely typed with JSDoc comments and I wanted to share some of my takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Besides runtime features like enums, basically everything you can express in TypeScript you can express in JSDoc. Certain features like generics are much clunkier, forcing you to type the return in order to infer generic slots. But sometimes the clunkier syntax can actually encourage better TypeScript practices by pushing devs to rely more on type inference.</li>
<li>For packages typed with JSDoc, CTRL/CMD clicking on a function will take you to actual code rather than a type declarations file. I <em>much</em> prefer this experience as a dev.</li>
<li>TypeScript tooling is surprisingly reusable for JSDoc projects. This includes type generation libraries that take schemas (e.g. OpenApi or GraphQL) defined in your backend and generate corresponding types in your front-end. I found that most of these can be set up to generate types in JSDoc comments instead of TypeScript code.</li>
</ol>
<p>Take it from a massive TypeScript nerd: JSDoc is not an anti-TypeScript position to take. It is the same powerful static analysis without the build step.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><div><p>By <!-- -->John James</p><p>Published on <!-- -->December 14, 2025</p><p>Read time ~3 min</p></div></header><p>I’ve used GraphQL, specifically Apollo Client and Server, for a couple of years in a real enterprise-grade application.</p><p>Not a toy app. Not a greenfield startup. A proper production setup with multiple teams, BFFs, downstream services, observability requirements, and real users.</p><p>And after all that time, I’ve come to a pretty boring conclusion:</p><p>GraphQL solves a real problem, but that problem is far more niche than people admit. In most enterprise setups, it’s already solved elsewhere, and when you add up the tradeoffs, GraphQL often ends up being a net negative.</p><p>This isn’t a “GraphQL bad” post. It’s a “GraphQL after the honeymoon” post.</p><h3>what GraphQL is supposed to solve</h3><p>The main problem GraphQL tries to solve is overfetching.<br>The idea is simple and appealing:</p><ul><li>the client asks for exactly the fields it needs</li><li>no more, no less</li><li>no wasted bytes</li><li>no backend changes for every new UI requirement</li></ul><p>On paper, that’s great. In practice, things are messier.</p><h3>overfetching is already solved by BFFs</h3><p>Most enterprise frontend architectures already have a BFF (Backend for Frontend).</p><p>That BFF exists specifically to:</p><ul><li>shape data for the UI</li><li>aggregate multiple downstream calls</li><li>hide backend complexity</li><li>return exactly what the UI needs</li></ul><p>If you’re using REST behind a BFF, overfetching is already solvable. The BFF can scope down responses and return only what the UI cares about.</p><p>Yes, GraphQL can also do this. But here’s the part people gloss over.<br>Most downstream services are still REST.</p><p>So now your GraphQL layer still has to overfetch from downstream REST APIs, then reshape the response. You didn’t eliminate overfetching. You just moved it down a layer.<br>That alone significantly diminishes GraphQL’s main selling point.</p><p>There is a case where GraphQL wins here. If multiple pages hit the same endpoint but need slightly different fields, GraphQL lets you scope those differences per query.<br>But let’s be honest about the trade.</p><p>You’re usually talking about saving a handful of fields per request, in exchange for:</p><ul><li>more setup</li><li>more abstraction</li><li>more indirection</li><li>more code to maintain</li></ul><p>That’s a very expensive trade for a few extra kilobytes.</p><h3>implementation time is much higher than REST</h3><p>GraphQL takes significantly longer to implement than a REST BFF.</p><p>With REST, you typically:</p><ul><li>call downstream services</li><li>adapt the response</li><li>return what the UI needs</li></ul><p>With GraphQL, you now have to:</p><ul><li>define a schema</li><li>define types</li><li>define resolvers</li><li>define data sources</li><li>write adapter functions anyway</li><li>keep schema, resolvers, and clients in sync</li></ul><p>GraphQL optimizes consumption at the cost of production speed.<br>In an enterprise environment, production speed matters more than theoretical elegance.</p><h3>observability is worse by default</h3><p>This one doesn’t get talked about enough.<br>GraphQL has this weird status code convention:</p><ul><li>400 if the query can’t be parsed</li><li>200 with an <code>errors</code> array if something failed during execution</li><li>200 if it succeeded or partially succeeded</li><li>500 if the server is unreachable</li></ul><p>From an observability standpoint, this is painful.</p><p>With REST:</p><ul><li>2XX means success</li><li>4XX means client error</li><li>5XX means server error</li></ul><p>If you filter dashboards by 2XX, you know those requests succeeded.<br>With GraphQL, a 200 can still mean partial or full failure.</p><p>Yes, Apollo lets you customize this behavior. But that’s kind of the point. You’re constantly paying a tax in extra configuration, extra conventions, and extra mental overhead just to get back to something REST gives you out of the box.</p><p>This matters when you’re on call, not when you’re reading blog posts.</p><h3>caching sounds amazing until you live with it</h3><p>Apollo’s normalized caching is genuinely impressive.</p><p>In theory. In practice, it’s fragile.</p><p>If you have two queries where only one field differs, Apollo treats them as separate queries. You then have to manually wire things so:</p><ul><li>existing fields come from cache</li><li>only the differing field is fetched</li></ul><p>At that point:</p><ul><li>you still have a roundtrip</li><li>you’ve added more code</li><li>debugging cache issues becomes its own problem</li></ul><p>Meanwhile, REST happily overfetches a few extra fields, caches the whole response, and moves on. Extra kilobytes are cheap. Complexity isn’t.</p><h3>the ID requirement is a leaky abstraction</h3><p>Apollo expects every object to have an <code>id</code> or <code>_id</code> field by default, or you need to configure a custom identifier.</p><p>That assumption does not hold in many enterprise APIs.</p><p>Plenty of APIs:</p><ul><li>don’t return IDs</li><li>don’t have natural unique keys</li><li>aren’t modeled as globally identifiable entities</li></ul><p>So now the BFF has to generate IDs locally just to satisfy the GraphQL client.</p><p>That means:</p><ul><li>more logic</li><li>more fields</li><li>you’re always fetching one extra field anyway</li></ul><p>Which is ironic, considering the original goal was to reduce overfetching.</p><p>REST clients don’t impose this kind of constraint.</p><h3>file uploads and downloads are awkward</h3><p>GraphQL is simply not a good fit for binary data.</p><p>In practice, you end up:</p><ul><li>returning a download URL</li><li>then using REST to fetch the file anyway</li></ul><p>Embedding large payloads like PDFs directly in GraphQL responses leads to bloated responses and worse performance.</p><p>This alone breaks the “single API” story.</p><h3>onboarding is slower</h3><p>Most frontend and full-stack developers are far more experienced with REST than GraphQL.</p><p>Introducing GraphQL means:</p><ul><li>teaching schemas</li><li>teaching resolvers</li><li>teaching query composition</li><li>teaching caching rules</li><li>teaching error semantics</li></ul><p>That learning curve creates friction, especially when teams need to move fast.</p><p>REST is boring, but boring scales extremely well.</p><h3>error handling is harder than it needs to be</h3><p>GraphQL error responses are… weird.</p><p>You have:</p><ul><li>nullable vs non-nullable fields</li><li>partial data</li><li>errors arrays</li><li>extensions with custom status codes</li><li>the need to trace which resolver failed and why</li></ul><p>All of this adds indirection.</p><p>Compare that to a simple REST setup where:</p><ul><li>input validation fails, return a 400</li><li>backend fails, return a 500</li><li>zod error, done</li></ul><p>Simple errors are easier to reason about than elegant ones.</p><h3>the net result</h3><p>GraphQL absolutely has valid use cases.</p><p>But in most enterprise environments:</p><ul><li>you already have BFFs</li><li>downstream services are REST</li><li>overfetching is not your biggest problem</li><li>observability, reliability, and speed matter more</li></ul><p>When you add everything up, GraphQL often ends up solving a narrow problem while introducing a broader set of new ones.<br>That’s why, after using it in production for years, I’d say this:</p><p>GraphQL isn’t bad. It’s just niche. And you probably don’t need it.</p><p>Especially if your architecture already solved the problem it was designed for.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><a href="https://github.com/eudoxia0/hashcards">hashcards</a> is a local-first <a href="https://borretti.me/article/effective-spaced-repetition">spaced repetition</a> app, along the lines of
<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> or <a href="https://mochi.cards/">Mochi</a>. Like Anki, it uses <a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-fsrs-in-100-lines">FSRS</a>, the most advanced scheduling
algorithm yet, to schedule reviews.</p>

<p>The thing that makes hashcards unique: it doesn’t use a database. Rather, your
flashcard collection is just a directory of Markdown files, like so:</p>

<div><pre><code>Cards/
  Math.md
  Chemistry.md
  Astronomy.md
  ...
</code></pre></div>

<p>And each file, or “deck”, looks like this:</p>

<div><pre><code>Q: What is the role of synaptic vesicles?
A: They store neurotransmitters for release at the synaptic terminal.

Q: What is a neurite?
A: A projection from a neuron: either an axon or a dendrite.

C: Speech is [produced] in [Broca's] area.

C: Speech is [understood] in [Wernicke's] area.
</code></pre></div>

<p>You write flashcards more or less like you’d write ordinary notes, with
lightweight markup to denote basic (question/answer) flashcards and <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#cloze-deletion">cloze
deletion</a> flashcards. Then, to study, you run:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ hashcards drill &lt;path to the cards directory&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>This opens a web interface on <code>localhost:8000</code>, where you can review the
flashcards. Your performance and review history is stored in an <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>
database in the same directory as the cards. Cards are content-addressed, that
is, identified by the hash of their text.</p>

<p>This central design decision yields many benefits: you can edit your flashcards
with your editor of choice, store your flashcard collection in a <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> repo,
track its changes, share it on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> with others (<a href="https://github.com/eudoxia0/flashcards">as I have</a>). You can
use scripts to generate flashcards from some source of structured data (e.g. a
CSV of English/French vocabulary pairs). You can query and manipulate your
collection using standard Unix tools, or programmatically, without having to dig
into the internals of some app’s database.</p>

<p>Why build a new spaced repetition app? Mostly because I was dissatisfied with
both Anki and Mochi. But also, additionally, because my flashcards collection is
very important to me, and having it exist either in some remote database, or as
an opaque unusable data blob on my computer, doesn’t feel good. “Markdown files
in a Git repo” gives me a level of ownership that other approaches lack.</p>

<p>The rest of this post explains my frustrations with Anki and Mochi, and how I
landed on the design decisions for hashcards.</p>

<h2 id="anki">Anki</h2>

<p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> was the first SR system I used. It’s open source, so it will be around
forever; it has a million plugins; it was the first SR system to use <a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-fsrs-in-100-lines">FSRS</a> for
scheduling. It has really rich stats, which I think are mostly useless but are
fun to look at. And the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#note-types">note types</a> feature is really good: it lets you
generate a large number of flashcards automatically from structured data.</p>

<p>The central problem with Anki is that the interface is really bad. This
manifests in various ways.</p>

<p>First, it is ugly to look at, particularly the review screen. And this
diminishes your enjoyment of what is already an often boring and frustrating
process.</p>

<p>Second, doing simple things is hard. A nice feature of Mochi is that when you
start the app you go right into review mode. You’re drilling flashcards before
you even realize it. Anki doesn’t have a “study all cards due today”, rather,
you have to manually go into a deck and click the “Study Now” button. So what I
would do is put all my decks under a “Root” deck, and study that. But this is a
hack.</p>

<p>And, third: card input uses WYSIWYG editing. So, you’re either jumping from the
keyboard to the mouse (which increases latency, and makes flashcard creation
more frustrating) or you have to remember all these keybindings to do basic
things like “make this text a cloze deletion” or “make this <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/math.html">TeX math</a>”.</p>

<p>Finally, plugins are a double-edged sword. Because having the <em>option</em> to use
them is nice, but the experience of <em>actually</em> using most plugins is bad. The
whole setup feels janky, like a house of cards. Most of the time, if a feature
is not built into the app itself, I would rather live without it than use a plugin.</p>

<h2 id="mochi">Mochi</h2>

<p><a href="https://mochi.cards/">Mochi</a> feels like it was built to address the main complaint about Anki: the
interface. It is intuitive, good looking, shortcut-rich. No jank. Instead of
WYSIWYG, card text is Markdown: this is delightful.</p>

<p>There’s a few problems. While Markdown is a very low-friction way to write
flashcards, cloze deletions in Mochi are very verbose. In hashcards, you can
write this:</p>

<div><pre><code>Speech is [produced] in [Broca's] area.
</code></pre></div>

<p>The equivalent in Mochi is this:</p>

<div><pre><code>Speech is {{1::produced}} in {{2::Broca's}} area.
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is a lot of typing. And you might object that it’s only a few characters
longer. But when you’re studying from a textbook, or when you’re copying words
from a vocabulary table, these small frictions add up. If writing flashcards is
frustrating, you’ll write fewer of them: and that means less knowledge
gained. Dually, a system that makes flashcard creation as frictionless as
possible means more flashcards, and more knowledge.</p>

<p>Another problem is that Mochi doesn’t have an equivalent of Anki’s <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#note-types">note
types</a>. For example: you can make a note type for chemical elements, with
fields like atomic number, symbol, name, etc., and write templates to generate
flashcards asking questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the atomic number of [name]?</li>
  <li>What element has atomic number [number]?</li>
  <li>What is the symbol for [name]?</li>
  <li>What element has symbol [symbol]?</li>
</ul>

<p>And so on for other properties. This is good. Automation is good. Less work,
more flashcards. Mochi doesn’t have this feature. It has <a href="https://mochi.cards/docs/#templates">templates</a>, but
these are not as powerful.</p>

<p>But the biggest problem with Mochi, I think, is the algorithm. Until <a href="https://x.com/MochiCardsApp/status/1924692507570667630">very
recently</a>, when they added beta support for FSRS, the algorithm used by
Mochi was even simpler than <a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-sm2-in-rust">SM-2</a>. It was based on <a href="https://mochi.cards/docs/faq/#which-spaced-repetition-algorithm-does-mochi-use">multipliers</a>:
remembering a card multiplies its interval by a number &gt;1, forgetting a card
multiplies its interval by a number between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>The supposed rationale for this is simplicity: the user can reason about the
algorithm more easily. But I think this is pointless. The whole point of an SR
app is the software manages the schedule for you, and the user is completely
unaware of how the scheduler works. The optimality is to have the most advanced
possible scheduling algorithm (meaning the one that yields the most recall for
the least review time) under the most intuitive interface possible, and the user
just reaps the benefits.</p>

<p>Obviously without an RCT we can’t compare Mochi/<a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-sm2-in-rust">SM-2</a>/FSRS, but my subjective
experience of it is that the algorithm works well for the short-term, and
falters on the long-term. It’s very bad when you forget a mature card: if a card
has an interval of sixty days, and you click forget, you don’t reset the
interval to one day (which is good, because it helps you reconsolidate the lost
knowledge). Rather, the interval is multiplied by the forget multiplier (by
default: 0.5) down to <em>thirty days</em>. What’s the use? If I forgot something after
sixty days, I surely won’t have better recall in thirty.</p>

<p>You can fix this by setting the forget multiplier to zero. But you have to know
this is how it works, and, crucially: I don’t want to configure things! I don’t
want “scheduler parameter finetuning” to be yet another skill I have to acquire:
I want the scheduler to <em>just work</em>.</p>

<p>In general, I think spaced repetition algorithms are too optimistic. I’d rather
see cards slightly more often, and spend more time reviewing things, than get
stuck in “forgetting hell”. But developers have to worry that making the system
too burdensome will hurt retention.</p>

<p>In Anki, it’s the interface that’s frustrating, but the algorithm works
marvelously. In Mochi, the interface is delightful, but it’s the algorithm
that’s frustrating. Because you can spend months and months drilling flashcards,
building up your collection, but when the cards cross some invisible age
threshold, you start to forget them, and the algorithm does not help you relearn
things you have forgotten. Eventually I burned out on it and stopped doing my
reviews, because I expected to forget everything eventually anyhow. And now they
added support for FSRS, but by now I have 1700 cards overdue.</p>

<p>Additionally: Mochi has only two buttons, “Forgot” and “Remembered”. This is
simpler for the user, yes, but most SR scheduling algorithms have more options
for a reason: different degrees of recall adjust the card parameters by
different magnitudes.</p>

<h2 id="hashcards">Hashcards</h2>

<p>What do I want from a spaced repetition system?</p>

<p>The first thing is: card creation must be frictionless. I have learned that the
biggest bottleneck in spaced repetition, for me, is not doing the reviews (I am
very disciplined about this and have done SR reviews daily for months on end),
it’s not even converting conceptual knowledge into flashcards, the biggest
bottleneck is just entering cards into the system.</p>

<p>The surest way to shore up your knowledge of some concept or topic is to write
more flashcards about it: asking the same question in different ways, in
different directions, from different angles. More volume means you see the same
information more often, asking in different ways prevents “memorizing the shape
of the card”, and it acts as a kind of redundancy: there are multiple edges
connecting that bit of knowledge to the rest of your mind.</p>

<p>And there have been many times where I have thought: I would make this more
solid by writing another flashcard. But I opted not to because the marginal
flashcard is too effortful.</p>

<p>If getting cards into the system involves a lot of friction, you write fewer
cards. And there’s an opportunity cost: the card you don’t write is a concept
you don’t learn. Integrated across time, it’s entire oceans of knowledge which
are lost.</p>

<p>So: the system should make card entry effortless. This was the guiding principle
behind the design of the hashcards text format. For example, cloze deletions use
square brackets because in a US keyboard, square brackets can be typed without
pressing shift (compare Mochi’s curly brace). And it’s one bracket, not
two. Originally, the format was one line per card, with blank lines separating
flashcards, and question-answer cards used slashes to separate the sides, like
so:</p>

<div><pre><code>What is the atomic number of carbon? / 6

The atomic number of [carbon] is [6].
</code></pre></div>

<p>And this is strictly less friction. But it creates a problem for multi-line
flashcards, which are common enough that they should not be a second-class
citizen. Eventually, I settled on the current format:</p>

<div><pre><code>Q: What is the atomic number of carbon?
A: 6

C: The atomic number of [carbon] is [6].
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which is only slightly more typing, and has the benefit that you can easily
visually identify where a card begins and ends, and what kind of card it is. I
spent a lot of time arguing back and forth with <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a> about what the optimal
format should be.</p>

<p>Another source of friction is not creating the cards but <em>editing</em> them. The
central problem is that your knowledge changes and improves over time. Often
textbooks take this approach where Chapter 1 introduces one kind of ontology,
and by Chapter 3 they tell you, “actually that was a lie, here’s the real
ontology of this subject”, and then you have to go back and edit the old
flashcards to match. Because otherwise you have one card asking, e.g., for the
undergraduate definition of some concept, while another asks you for the
graduate-level definition, creating ambiguity.</p>

<p>For this reason, when studying from a textbook, I create a deck for the
textbook, with sub-decks for each chapter. That makes it easy to match the
flashcards to their source material (to ensure they are aligned) and each
chapter deck only has a few tens of cards usually, keeping them navigable.</p>

<p>Sometimes you wrote multiple cards for the same concept, so you have to update
them all at once. Finding the related ones can be hard if the deck is large. In
hashcards, a deck is just a Markdown file. The cards immediately above and below
a card are usually semantically related. You just scroll up and down and make
the edits in place.</p>

<p>But why plain-text files in a Git repo? Why not use the above format, but in a
“normal” app with a database?</p>

<p>The vague idea of a spaced repetition system where flashcards are stored as
plain-text files in a Git repo had been kicking around my cranium for a long
time. I remember asking an Ankihead on IRC circa 2011 if such a thing
existed. At some point I read <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/My_implementation_of_a_personal_mnemonic_medium">Andy Matuschak’s note</a> on his
implementation of an SR system. In his system, the flashcards are colocated with
prose notes. The notation is similar to mine: <code>Q</code> and <code>A</code> tags for
question-answer cards, and <code>{curly braces}</code> for cloze deletions. And the cards
are content-addressed: identified by their hash. Which is an obviously good
idea. But his code is private and, besides, I feel that prose notes and
flashcards are very different beasts, and I don’t need or want them to mix.</p>

<p>But I think the idea of plain-text spaced repetition got bumped up the priority
queue because I spontaneously started using a workflow that was similar to my
current hashcards workflow.</p>

<p>When studying from a textbook or a website, I’d write flashcards in a Markdown
file. Usually, I used a shorthand like <code>[foo]</code> for cloze deletions. Then I’d use
a Python script to transform the shorthand into the <code>{{1::foo}}</code> notation used by Mochi. And I’d edit the flashcards in the file, as
my knowledge built up and my sense of what was relevant and important to
remember improved. And then, when I was done with the chapter or document or
whatever, only then, I would manually import the flashcards into Mochi.</p>

<p>And it struck me that the last step was kind of unnecessary. I was already
writing my flashcards as lightly-annotated Markdown in plain-text files. I had
<a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-fsrs-in-100-lines">already implemented FSRS</a> out of curiosity. I was looking for a
personal project to build during funemployment. So hashcards was by then a very
neatly-shaped hole that I just needed to paint inside.</p>

<p>It turns out that using plain-text storage has many synergies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can edit the cards using whatever editor you use, build up a library of
card-creating macros, and navigate the collection using the editor’s file
browser.</li>
  <li>You can query and update the collection using standard Unix tools, or a
programming language, e.g. using <code>wc</code> to get the total number of words in the
collection, or using <code>awk</code> to make a bulk-update to a set of cards.</li>
  <li>You can use Git for version control. Git is infinitely more featureful than
the change-tracking of any SR app: you can edit multiple cards in one commit,
branch, merge, use pull requests, etc.</li>
  <li>You can make your flashcards public on GitHub. I often wish people put more of
themselves out there: their blog posts, their dotfiles, their study notes. And
why not their flashcards? Even if they are not useful to someone else, there
is something enjoyable about reading what someone else finds interesting, or
enjoyable, or worth learning.</li>
  <li>You can generate flashcards using scripts (e.g., turn a CSV of foreign
language vocabulary into a deck of flashcards), and write a Makefile to tie
the script, data source, and target together. I <a href="https://github.com/eudoxia0/flashcards/blob/87b082e4723e5b1b286e3bb5378316f464cfc28f/Makefile">do this</a> in my
personal deck. Anki’s <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#note-types">note types</a> don’t have to be built into hashcards,
rather, you can DIY it using some Python and make.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result is a system where creating and editing flashcards is nearly
frictionless, that uses an advanced spaced repetition scheduler, and which
provides an elegant UI for drilling flashcards. I hope others will find it
useful.</p>

There are, of course, a ton of problems to solve. Chief among them is the obvious caveat that C is not a monoculture like Rust. There will be zero upstream libraries that use this tool natively. But I don't think it matters. I think I can build something which is as much better to the existing tools as, say, UV was to existing Python tools, even with that disadvantage.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46268226"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46268226" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46268226&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46264491"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I'm working on porting KiCad to the browser. It's a lot of sweat and tears, multithreading issues and some more sweat. I've updated a port of WxWidgets and now I support all the features KiCad needs with ~200 tests.</p><p>Right now I have a build that loads in the browser, but I really want to have "multithreading" which means workers in the web. One can use asyncify with emscripten to translate blocking C++ to WASM, but that transition is not perfect, right now I'm debugging a bug where there's a race condition that halts all execution and the main thread runs in an infinite loop waiting for the workers to stand up. I guess I'll have a few of those ahead.</p><p>The main goal is to 1. just have fun 2. use yjs as a collab backend so multiple people can edit the same PCB. This will probably work with pcbnew, KiCad's layout editor, since it has a plugin system and AFAIK I can do the sync layer there. For the rest ( schematic, component editor etc. ) I'll have to figure out something..
KiCad does not sync automatically if you modify a file, I'll have to do some lifting there.</p><p>Anyway, it's a lot of fun, I really want this thing to exist, I'm hoping that I won't run into a "wellll, this is just not going to work" kind of issue in the end.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46267589"><td></td></tr><tr id="46267634"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46267634" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46267634&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46264491"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I'm currently working on something that lets you describe a hardware product in plain English and get actual manufacturable files out — PCB, enclosure, firmware, the lot.</p><p>Very early days still. Whilst I created a fork of toon for Kicad (called TOKN), with the intention of using a reduced token format to generate schematics using LLM's, I could get the models to follow the syntax correctly, but they didn't have the knowledge. So I was then going to create a whole RAG system, but got distracted by this current project.</p><p>There are people out there doing AI schematic generation, like flux.ai (which is incredible (and incredibly well funded), but 90% of products, especially at proof of concept stage, are basically a microcontroller, some power, probably usb, and some IO, bluetooth/wifi if you're lucky. So we can use a library of pre-validated subcircuits and slots them together on a grid. Routing's deterministic, so if it compiles, it works. (sorry, deeppcb &amp; Quilter!)</p><p>The enclosure side is more fun: once the PCB's done you've got real dimensions to work with (board size, mounting holes, where the connectors poke out), so I use an image model to generate some concept art, then feed that to an openscad generating model as visual inspiration alongside the hard constraints.</p><p>Basically trying to get a full hardware product pipeline done automatically.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46268177"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46268177" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46268177&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46264491"></a></center></td><td><br>

The AI edits the real draw.io XML, it’s not just generating a picture, so you and the model are basically sharing the same canvas.</p><p>It can also try to rebuild a diagram from a screenshot/PDF and then you keep iterating together in chat + manual edits.</p><p>Recently I added “bring your own API key” for a bunch of providers and support for uploading PDFs/text to turn existing docs into diagrams.</p><p>Repo (just crossed ~10.2k): <a href="https://github.com/DayuanJiang/next-ai-draw-io" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/DayuanJiang/next-ai-draw-io</a>

<div><p>Published my first AUR package this week. It's called bleep, a simple interval timer that beeps.</p><p>The idea came from cooking bolognese. I needed something to remind me when to stir.

Verbose mode with a live countdown, pause/resume with signals, and a JSON output mode that works with Waybar. That last one is actually my favorite part. I get a little timer in my status bar that changes color when it's counting, paused, or beeping. Click to pause. Works great for pomodoro or just keeping track of things while working.</p><p>I switched from Mac to Arch and wanted to try the whole AUR thing. Used GoReleaser to automate the build and publish.

<div><p>I'm building a utility to help DJs find "play-out" versions of tracks they already like[1]. You can play with it here[2]. Streaming services are optimized for Radio Edits.

But I think it might be still interesting project because it is entirely vibe-coded - I don't even know Typescript (I know some Javascript from before React - but none of the new stuff). I did not look into the Typescript code at all - only at what the LLM presented to me when editing it and the docs.

<div><p>Open source Nerf blaster simulator, for both spring and pneumatic blasters.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/btrettel/blastersim" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/btrettel/blastersim</a></p><p>The core simulator part works, but I don't yet have a user interface or documentation. Probably just going to be text input files to start, maybe a GUI later. Recently, I'm mostly working on testing.</p><p>The simulator is object-oriented and basically allows one to build up a blaster from separate control volumes and connections between control volumes. This is useful as it allows the same core simulator framework to handle different blaster configurations and even variants of them. For example, someone asked me to make the spring piston able to pull a vacuum on its back side due to not having sufficient flow. That's easy here as I just need to add another control volume and the appropriate connection onto the basic springer configuration.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46267343"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46267343" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46267343&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46264491"></a></center></td><td><br>

Right now I'm working on better .po/gettext support, based on feedback from an early customer. With gettext you usually keeps source strings in the actual source code.

<div><p>I'm working on a hardware/software utility to play Switch/Switch 2 games remotely with my brothers. I found a way to emulate a Switch Pro Controller using a Raspberry Pi Pico based on several different sources (look in the README for more info). I used that to write a firmware for the Pico (with the help of GPT Codex 5.1).</p><p>Then I wrote a Python program that connects whatever controller my brothers want to use (as long as it's supported by SDL2.0) and forwards that data from their computer, through Parsec, through a USB-UART adapter, to the Pico, then to the Switch. I then have a low latency capture card (Magewell Pro Dual HDMI I got off of ebay for $100) forwarding the video and audio from the Switch to my PC which I share to my brothers via Parsec. The audio was a bit tricky to get right, and ended up having to use a Virtual audio cable and Voicemeeter potato (a software audio mixer) so that both myself and my brothers could hear the audio.</p><p>It works surprisingly well and the latency is pretty low. I even got rumble working! (but not motion controls. If anyone wants to attempt it, I will accept PRs). I haven't done any formal benchmarking for performance, but my brothers and I were able to play Smash Ultimate without too much bother about latency.</p><p>You could also use the accessory Python library I made to automate switch controller presses (look in the examples directory). Might be useful for TAS speedruns?</p><p>The project is here for anyone interested. It's a bit rough and needs some cleanup and maybe a video tutorial on remote setup. But here is the WIP:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/jyapayne/switch-pico" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/jyapayne/switch-pico</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46267958"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46267958" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46267958&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46264491"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I am working (mostly vibecoded) a Git history explorer in Go+modernc.org/Tk9.0: <a href="https://github.com/thiagokokada/gitk-go" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/thiagokokada/gitk-go</a>. It is heavily inspired in gitk, this is why the name and usage of Tk for the interface.</p><p>The reason for it was because after testing multiple Git history explorers, I still think nothing beats the gitk. Sublime Merge is probably the only alternative that I would seriously consider but I don't really like the UI and the fact that it is proprietary (I am not against proprietary software but I prefer an opensource solution when available). Other alternatives have some bugs or the interface few too slow. gitk itself is mostly fine, but sadly it tries to load the whole repository in memory and this is causing issues every time I try to navigate through nixpkgs (I can see the memory consumption going through the roof while the UI slow down to a crawl).</p><p>gitk-go loads a batch of commits (1000 by default) and once you get at the end of the list it loads more. I also add a few features that I miss from gitk, for example if you do any change in the repository (change branches, add files to stash, etc) it will automatically reflect in the UI.</p><p>Again, the code is mostly vibecoded since this is the first time I decided to try this from scratch. The code works well for my use cases and it is enough to replace gitk for me, but I can't guarantee there is no bugs and the amount of tests are small. But still, it was fun to see something that I wanted to create for a while (I had this idea for a long time since the issues with gitk that I was having) finally taking form. Probably the program is not useful for anyone but me, but if anything this is a feature, not a bug.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46267540"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46267540" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46267540&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46264491"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I've really enjoyed writing blog posts recently. Not only is it a great way to flex your writing muscles, but writing about a topic, unsurprisingly, helps you  <i>understand</i> that topic better too. I've had great conversations with friends about the posts I've written as well.</p><p>And sort of in that same vein, I've been developing my own static site generator that I eventually want to move my blog to.

<div><p>I'm still tweaking my tool for creating accessible Tailwind-style color palettes for web/UI design that pass WCAG 2 contrast requirements:</p><p><a href="https://www.inclusivecolors.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.inclusivecolors.com/</a></p><p>There's 100s of color palette generation tools, where most only let you customize a single color then try to autogenerate tints/shades without much thought about accessibility or tints/shades customization. The main features of this tool are:</p><p>- Emphasis on accessibility. A live UI mockup using your palette warns you if your tints/shades are lacking contrast when used in practice for headings, paragraphs, borders, and buttons, and teaches you the WCAG rules. Fixing contrast issues and exploring accessible color options is also made much easier using an HSLuv color picker, where only the lightness slider alters the contrast checks, and not the hue/saturation sliders (most tools use HSL, where hue/saturation changes counterintuitively alter contrast checks which makes accessibility really tough!).</p><p>- You can tweak the hue/saturation/lightness of every tint/shade. This is useful because autogenerated colors are never quite right, and customization is really important for branding work when you have to include specific tints/shades.  The curve-based hue/saturation/lightness editing UI also makes this a really quick process.</p><p>- Instead of just a handful of colors, this tool lets you create a full palette. For example, if your primary color is blue, you always end up needing other colors like green for success, red for danger, and gray for text, then 11 tints/shades for all of these, so you want a tool that lets you tweak, check, compare and manage them all at once.</p><p>It's mostly a demo on mobile so check it on desktop. I'm still working on making it easier to use as it probably requires some design background to understand, but really open to feedback!</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46266728"><td></td></tr><tr id="46265187"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46265187" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46265187&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46264491"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I’ve been building a crypto market visualization and simulation tool because I kept running into the same problem:
TradingView is great for charts, but it’s hard to answer simple “what-if” questions like would rotating into another coin actually have helped or did trimming and buying back improve outcomes, or just feel good in hindsight.
So I started building tools that simulate these scenarios directly on historical data. For example:
- flipping from coin A into coin B and back again over a chosen period
- selling part of a position and buying back later after a drawdown</p><p>I’m still early and adding ideas as I go, but it’s already helped me questions I had.</p><p>Examples:

It translates the mission object tree from the Torque .mis files into a Three.js scene graph. Eventually though, I noticed that some mission definitions were more dynamic – Torque .mis files are really just TorqueScript .cs files with a different extension and some pragma/magic comments. So, to actually handle every map would require not just a mission file parser, but a whole TorqueScript runtime. Implementing THAT part seemed really tedious and, frankly, uninteresting to me. So I had Claude Code get a whole TorqueScript transpiler and runtime working. Now, when you load a mission, it actually runs all the same scripts that Tribes 2 runs to load the mission, all the way from server.cs and its `CreateServer()` function.</p><p>Currently, I'm continuing to get its rendering matching Tribes 2 as closely as possible, and setting things up so that live editing of missions will work.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://github.com/exogen/t2-mapper" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/exogen/t2-mapper</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46266534"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46266534" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46266534&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46264491"></a></center></td><td><br>

The output is static HTML dashboards, PDFs, and CSVs that track month-over-month shifts. I'm adding to it weekly.</p><p>Mostly I’m trying to answer questions like:</p><p>* Which companies are structurally positioned for outsized upside in The Last Economy?</p><p>* How should I deliver the research so that it would have been actionable to someone like me 30 years ago?</p><p>* What signals would help folks identify “the next NVIDIA” 5 years earlier?</p><p>The inference costs real $$$ so I've set up a Patreon that, hopefully, will allow me to scale coverage and extend the modelling and methodology. There is a free tier and some recent, complete example output on the web site. I'm also happy to gift a free month for folks willing to provide constructive feedback: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/NextArcResearch/redeem/CC2A2" rel="nofollow">https://www.patreon.com/NextArcResearch/redeem/CC2A2</a> - in particular I'm looking for feedback on how to make the research more actionable without drifting into "financial advice".</p><p>I don't collect any data but Patreon does for authentication and Cloudflare does to deliver Pages.

<div><p>I'm building a yet another AI chat app.</p><p>My initial goal is to make a functional SillyTavern (AI roleplaying) replacement. SillyTavern builds prompts from a few rigid buckets (character, scenario, lore, system prompt, author's note...), which makes complex setups hard to manage. Content gets duplicated, settings have to be toggled in multiple places, and it’s easy to accidentally carry or modify state across conversations. Over time, it becomes difficult to tell what context is actually in effect.</p><p>I’m building an alternative that treats context as small, reusable pieces that can be composed and organized flexibly, rather than locked into fixed categories. Characters, settings, and behaviors can be mixed, reused, or temporarily enabled without duplication or manual cleanup, and edits preserve clear history instead of rewriting the past. The goal is to make managing complex context deliberate and controlled instead of fragile.</p><p>Although I’m trying to get the functionality required for roleplaying done first, the app is generic enough for other AI workflows where fine-grained, explicit context control is an improvement over existing chat interfaces. Think: start a new conversation with an assistant and start checking off rules, documents, and instructions to apply to the chat. Regenerate responses with clarifications or additional one-time context layers.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46267127"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46267127" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46267127&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46264491"></a></center></td><td><br>

    <h2 id="ai-and-the-ironies-of-automation---part-2">AI and the ironies of automation - Part 2</h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/ironies_of_ai_1/">previous post</a>, we discussed several observations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironies_of_Automation">Lisanne Bainbridge</a> made in her much-noticed paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0005109883900468">“The ironies of automation”</a>, she published in 1983 and what they mean for the current “white-collar” work automation attempts leveraging LLMs and AI agents based on LLMs, still requiring humans in the loop. We stopped at the end of the first chapter, “Introduction”, of the paper.</p>
<p>In this post, we will continue with the second chapter, “Approaches to solutions”, and see what we can learn there.</p>
<h2 id="comparing-apples-and-oranges">Comparing apples and oranges?</h2>
<p>However, before we start: Some of the observations and recommendations made in the paper must be taken with a grain of salt when applying them to the AI-based automation attempts of today. When monitoring an industrial production plant, it is often a matter of seconds until a human operator must act if something goes wrong to avoid severe or even catastrophic accidents.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is of the highest importance to design industrial control stations in a way that a human operator can recognize deviations and malfunctions as easily as possible and immediately trigger countermeasures. A lot of work is put into the design of all the displays and controls, like, e.g., the well-known emergency stop switch in a screaming red color that is big enough to be punched with a flat hand, fist or alike within a fraction of a second if needed.</p>
<p>When it comes to AI-based solutions automating white-collar work, we usually do not face such critical conditions. However, this is not a reason to dismiss the observations and recommendations in the paper easily because, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most companies are efficiency-obsessed. Hence, they also expect AI solutions to increase “productivity”, i.e., efficiency, to a superhuman level. If a human is meant to monitor the output of the AI and intervene if needed, this requires that the human needs to comprehend what the AI solution produced at superhuman speed – otherwise we are down to human speed. This presents a quandary that can only be solved if we enable the human to comprehend the AI output at superhuman speed (compared to producing the same output by traditional means).</li>
<li>Most companies have a tradition of nurturing a culture of urgency and scarcity, resulting in a lot of pressure towards and stress for the employees. Stress is known to trigger the fight-or-flight mode (an ancient survival mechanism built into us to cope with dangerous situations) which massively reduces the normal cognitive capacity of a human. While this mechanism supports humans in making very quick decisions and taking quick actions (essential in dangerous situations), it deprives them of the ability to conduct any deeper analysis (not being essential in dangerous situations). If deeper analysis is required to make a decision, this may take a lot longer than without stress – if possible at all. This means we need to enable humans to conduct deeper analysis under stress as well or to provide the information in a way that eliminates the need for deeper analysis (which is not always possible).</li>
</ul>
<p>If we let this sink in (plus a few other aspects, I did not write down here but you most likely will add in your mind), we quickly come to the conclusion that also in our AI-related automation context humans are often expected to make quick decisions and act based on them, often under conditions that make it hard (if not impossible) to conduct any in-depth analysis.</p>
<p>If we then also take into account, that depending on the situation a wrong result produced by an AI solution which eluded the human operator may have severe consequences in the worst case (e.g., assume a major security incident due to a missed wrongdoing of the AI solution), the situation is not that far away anymore from the situation in an industrial plant’s control station.</p>
<p>Summarizing, we surely need to add the necessary grain of salt, i.e., ask ourselves how strict the timing constraints in our specific setting are to avoid comparing apples and oranges in the worst case. However, in general we need to consider the whole range of possible settings which will – probably more often than we think – include that humans need to make decisions in a very short time under stressful conditions (which makes things more precarious).</p>
<h2 id="the-worst-ui-possible">The worst UI possible</h2>
<p>This brings us immediately to Lisanne Bainbridge’s first recommendation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In any situation where a low probability event must be noticed quickly then the operator must be given artificial assistance, if necessary even alarms on alarms.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the system must support the human operator as well as possible in detecting a problem, especially if it tends to occur rarely. It is a consequence of the <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/ironies_of_ai_1/#monitoring-fatigue">“monitoring fatigue” problem we discussed in the previous post</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the learnings people have made, a lot of effort has been put into the design of the displays, the controls and also the alerting mechanisms of industrial production control stations, making sure the human operators can make their jobs as good, as stress-free and as reliable as possible.</p>
<p>Enter AI agents.</p>
<p>The usual idea is that a single human controls a fleet of AI agents that are designed to do some kind of job, e.g., writing code. Sometimes, most agents are generic “workers”, orchestrated by some kind of supervisor that delegates parts of the work to the worker agents. Sometimes, the different agents are “specialists”, each for a certain aspect of the job to be done, that collaborate using some kind of choreography (or are also orchestrated by a supervisor). While the generic workers are easier to set up, the specialized workers usually produce more accurate results.</p>
<p>Because these AI-based agents sometimes produce errors, a human – in our example a software developer – needs to supervise the AI agent fleet and ideally intervenes <em>before</em> the AI agents do something they should not do. Therefore, the AI agents typically create a plan of what they intend to do first (which as a side effect also increases the likelihood that they do not drift off). Then, the human verifies the plan and approves it if it is correct, and the AI agents execute the plan. If the plan is not correct, the human rejects it and sends the agents back to replanning, providing information about what needs to be altered.</p>
<p>Let us take Lisanne Bainbridge’s recommendation and compare it to this approach that is currently “best practice” to control an AI agent fleet.</p>
<p>Unless we tell them to act differently, LLMs and also AI agents based on them are quite chatty. Additionally, they tend to communicate with an air of utter conviction. Thus, they present to you this highly detailed, multi-step plan of what they intend to do, including lots of explanations, in this perfectly convinced tone. Often, these plans are more than 50 or 100 lines of text, sometimes even several hundred lines.</p>
<p>Most of the time, the plans are fine. However, sometimes the AI agents mess things up. They make wrong conclusions, or they forget what they are told to do and drift off – not very often, but it happens. Sometimes the problem is obvious at first sight. But more often, it is neatly hidden somewhere behind line 123: “… and because 2 is bigger than 3, it is clear, we need to &lt; do something critical &gt;”. But because it is so much text the agents flood you with all the time and because the error is hidden so well behind this wall of conviction, we miss it – and the AI agent does something critical wrong.</p>
<p>We cannot blame the person for missing the error in the plan. The problem is that this is probably the worst UI and UX possible for anyone who is responsible for avoiding errors in a system that rarely produces errors.</p>
<p>But LLM-based agents make errors all the time, you may say. Well, not all the time. Sometimes they do. And the better the instructions and the setup of the interacting agents, the fewer errors they produce. Additionally, we can expect more specialized and refined agents in the future that become increasingly better in their respective areas of expertise. Still, most likely they will never become completely error-free because of the underlying technology that cannot guarantee consistent correctness.</p>
<p>This is the setting we need to ponder if we talk about the user interface for a human observer: a setting where the agent fleet only rarely makes errors but we still need a human monitoring and intervening if things should go wrong. It is not yet clear how such an interface should look like, but most definitely not as it looks now. Probably we could harvest some good insights from our UX/UI design colleagues for industrial production plant control stations. We would need only to ask them …</p>
<h2 id="the-training-paradox">The training paradox</h2>
<p>Lisanne Bainbridge then makes several recommendations regarding the required training of the human operator. This again is a rich section, and I can only recommend reading it on your own because it contains several subtle yet important hints that are hard to bring across without citing the whole chapter. Here, I will highlight only a few aspects. She starts with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Some points made in the previous section] make it clear that it can be important to maintain manual skills.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then she talks about letting the human operator take over control regularly, i.e., do the job instead of the machine as a very effective training option. Actually, without doing hands-on work regularly, the skills of a human expert deteriorate surprisingly fast.</p>
<p>But if taking over the work regularly is not an option, e.g., because we want continuous superhuman productivity leveraging AI agents (no matter if it makes sense or not), we still need to make sure that the human operator can take over if needed. In such a setting, training must take place in some other way, usually using some kind of simulator.</p>
<p>However, there is a problem with simulators, especially if human intervention is only needed (and wanted) if things do not work as expected:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are problems with the use of any simulator to train for extreme situations. Unknown faults cannot be simulated, and system behaviour may not be known for faults which can be predicted but have not been experienced.</p></blockquote>
<p>The consequence of this issue is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This means that training must be concerned with general strategies rather than specific responses […]</p></blockquote>
<p>However:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is inadequate to expect the operator to react to unfamiliar events solely by consulting operating procedures. These cannot cover all the possibilities, so the operator is expected to monitor them and fill in the gaps.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which leaves us with the irony:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, it is ironic to train operators in following instructions and then put them in the system to provide intelligence.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a problem we will need to face with AI agents and their supervising humans in the future, too. The supervising experts are meant to intervene whenever things become messy, whenever the AI agents get stuck, often in unforeseen ways. These are not regular tasks. Often, these are also not the issues we expect an AI agent to run into and thus can provide training for. These are extraordinary situations, the ones we do not expect – and the more refined and specialized the AI agents will become in the future, the more often the issues that require human intervention will be of this kind.</p>
<p>The question is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>How can we train human operators at all to be able to intervene skillfully in exceptional, usually hard to solve situations?</li>
<li>How can we train a human operator so that their skills remain sharp over time and they remain able to address an exceptional situation quickly and resourcefully?</li>
</ol>
<p>The questions seem to hint at a sort of paradox, and an answer to both questions is all but obvious. At the moment, we still have enough experienced subject matter experts that the questions may feel of lower importance. But if we only start to address the questions when they become pressing, they will be even harder – if not impossible – to solve.</p>
<p>To end this consideration with the words of Lisanne Bainbridge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the final irony is that it is the most successful automated systems, with rare need for manual intervention, which may need the greatest investment in human operator training.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, we cannot simply take a few available human experts and make them supervise agents that took over their work without any further investments in the humans. Instead, we need to train them continuously, and the better the agents become, the more expensive the training of the supervisors will become. I highly doubt that decision makers who primarily think about saving money when it comes to AI agents are aware of this irony.</p>
<h2 id="interlude">Interlude</h2>
<p>As I wrote in the beginning of <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/ironies_of_ai_1/">first part of this blog series</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0005109883900468">“The ironies of automation”</a> is a very rich and dense paper. We are still only at the end of the second chapter “Approaches to solutions” which is two and a half pages into the paper and there is still a whole third chapter called “Human-computer collaboration” which takes up another page until we get to the conclusion.</p>
<p>While this third chapter also contains a lot of valuable advice that goes well beyond our focus here, I will leave it to you to read it on your own. As I indicated at the beginning, this paper is more than worth the time spent on it.</p>
<h2 id="the-leadership-dilemma">The leadership dilemma</h2>
<p>However, before finishing this little blog series, I would like to mention a new kind of dilemma that Lisanne Bainbridge did not discuss in her paper because the situation was a bit different with industrial production plant automation than with AI-agent-based automation. But as this topic fits nicely into the just-finished training paradox section, I decided to add it here.</p>
<p>The issue is that just monitoring an AI agent fleet doing its work and intervening if things go wrong usually is not sufficient, at least not yet. All the things discussed before apply, but there is more to interacting with AI agents because we cannot simply be reactive with AI agents. We cannot simply watch them doing their work and only intervene if things go wrong. Instead, we additionally need to be proactive with them: We need to <em>direct</em> them.</p>
<p>We need to tell the AI agents what to do, what not to do, which chunks to pick and so on. This is basically a <em>leadership role</em>. While you do not lead humans, the kind of work is quite similar: You are responsible for the result; you are allowed to set directions and constraints, but you do not immediately control the work. You only control it through communicating with the agents and trying to direct them in the right direction with orders, with feedback, with changed orders, with setting different constraints, etcetera.</p>
<p>This is a skill set most people do not have naturally. Usually, they need to develop it over time. Typically, before people are put in a leadership role directing humans, they will get a lot of leadership training teaching them the skills and tools needed to lead successfully. For most people, this is essential because if they come from the receiving end of orders (in the most general sense of “orders”), typically they are not used to setting direction and constraints. This tends to be a completely new skill they need to learn.</p>
<p>This does not apply only to leading humans but also to leading AI agents. While AI agents are not humans, and thus leadership will be different in detail, the basic skills and tools needed are the same. This is, BTW, one of the reasons why the people who praise agentic AI on LinkedIn and the like are very often managers who lead (human) teams. For them, leading an AI agent fleet feels very natural because it is very close to the work they do every day. However, for the people currently doing the work, leading an AI agent fleet usually does not feel natural at all.</p>
<p>However, I have not yet seen anyone receiving any kind of leadership training before being left alone with a fleet of AI agents, and I still see little discussion about the issue. “If it does not work properly, you need better prompts” is the usual response if someone struggles with directing agents successfully.</p>
<p>Sorry, but it is not that easy. The issue is much bigger than just optimizing a few prompts. The issue is that people have to change their approach completely to get any piece of work done. Instead of doing it directly, they need to learn how to get it done indirectly. They need to learn how to direct a group of AI agents effectively, how to <em>lead</em> them.</p>
<p>This also adds to the training irony of the previous topic. Maybe the AI agent fleets will become good enough in the future that we can omit the proactive part of the work and only need to focus on the reactive part of the work, the monitor-and-intervene part. But until then, we need to teach human supervisors of AI agent fleets how to lead them effectively.</p>
<h2 id="moving-on">Moving on</h2>
<p>We discussed several ironies and paradoxes from Lisanne Bainbridge’s “The ironies of automation” and how they also apply to agentic AI. We looked at the unlearning and recall dilemma and what it means for the next generation of human supervisors. We discussed monitoring fatigue and the status issue. We looked at the UX and UI deficiencies of current AI agents and the training paradox. And we finally looked at the leadership dilemma, which Lisanne Bainbridge did not discuss in her paper but which complements the training paradox.</p>
<p>I would like to conclude with the conclusion of Lisanne Bainbridge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] humans working without time-pressure can be impressive problem solvers. The difficulty remains that they are less effective when under time pressure. I hope this paper has made clear both the irony that one is not by automating necessarily removing the difficulties, and also the possibility that resolving them will require even greater technological ingenuity than does classic automation.</p></blockquote>
<p>I could not agree more.</p>
<p>I think over time we will become clear on how much “The ironies of automation” also applies to automation done with AI agents and that we cannot ignore the insights known for more than 40 years meanwhile. I am also really curious how the solutions to the ironies and paradoxes will look like.</p>
<p>Until then, I hope I gave you a bit of food for thought to ponder. If you should have some good ideas regarding the ironies and how to address them, please do not hesitate to share them with the community. We learn best by sharing and discussing, and maybe your contribution will be a step towards solving the issues discussed …</p>

<p>In 1950, while discussing the recent wave of flying saucer reports over lunch with colleagues at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, physicist Enrico Fermi asked a simple question.</p>



<p>There are hundreds of billions of stars in our Milky Way galaxy, and – presumed at the time – a significant percentage have Earth-like habitable planets orbiting them. The galaxy is billions of years old, and the odds are high that there should be other technological civilisations out there. But we see no convincing sign of them.</p>



<p>So, where is everybody?</p>



<p>This question is now know as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi Paradox</a>.</p>



<p>In the last couple of years, I’ve been seeing another paradox. Many people claim that working software can now be produced for pennies on the pound, in a fraction of the time that it takes humans. Some go so far as to claim that we’re in the age of commoditised software, throwaway software, and hail the end of the software industry as we know it.</p>



<p>Why buy a CRM solution or a ERM system when “AI” can generate one for you in hours or even minutes? Why sign up for a SaaS platform when Cursor can spit one out just as good in the blink of an eye?</p>



<p>But when we look beyond the noise – beyond these sensational flying saucer reports – we see nothing of the sort. No AI-generated Spotify or Salesforce or SAP. No LLM-generated games bothering the charts. No <a href="https://mikelovesrobots.substack.com/p/wheres-the-shovelware-why-ai-coding">noticeable uptick in new products</a> being added to the app stores.</p>



<p>So, <em>where is everybody</em>?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><p>On November 25th, 2025, we were on a routine Slack huddle debugging a production issue when we noticed something strange: a PR in one of our internal repos was suddenly closed, showed zero changes, and had a single commit from... Linus Torvalds?</p>
<p>The commit message was just "init."</p>
<p>Within seconds, our #git Slack channel exploded with notifications. Dozens of force-pushes. PRs closing across multiple repositories. All attributed to one of our engineers.</p>
<img src="https://trigger.dev/blog/shai-hulud-postmortem/screenshots/nicks-alert.png" alt="Nick's initial alert">
<p>We had been compromised by <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/shai-hulud-strikes-again-v2">Shai-Hulud 2.0</a>, a sophisticated npm supply chain worm that compromised over 500 packages, affected 25,000+ repositories, and spread across the JavaScript ecosystem. We weren't alone: <a href="https://posthog.com/blog/nov-24-shai-hulud-attack-post-mortem">PostHog</a>, Zapier, AsyncAPI, Postman, and ENS were among those hit.</p>
<p>This is the complete story of what happened, how we responded, and what we've changed to prevent this from happening again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No Trigger.dev packages were ever compromised. The <code>@trigger.dev/*</code> packages and <code>trigger.dev</code> CLI were never infected with Shai-Hulud malware. This incident involved one of our engineers installing a compromised package on their development machine, which led to credential theft and unauthorized access to our GitHub organization. Our published packages remained safe throughout.</p>

<h2 id="the-compromise">The compromise</h2>
<p>On the evening of November 24th, around 20:27 UTC (9:27 PM local time in Germany), one of our engineers was experimenting with a new project. They ran a command that triggered <code>pnpm install</code>. At that moment, somewhere in the dependency tree, a malicious package executed.</p>
<p>We don't know exactly which package delivered the payload. The engineer was experimenting at the time and may have deleted the project directory as part of cleanup. By the time we investigated, we couldn't trace back to the specific package. The engineer checked their shell history and they'd only run install commands in our main trigger repo, cloud repo, and one experimental project.</p>
<p>This is one of the frustrating realities of these attacks: once the malware runs, identifying the source becomes extremely difficult. The package doesn't announce itself. The <code>pnpm install</code> completes successfully. Everything looks normal.</p>
<p>What we do know is that the Shai-Hulud malware ran a <code>preinstall</code> script that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Downloaded and executed <a href="https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog">TruffleHog</a>, a legitimate security tool repurposed for credential theft</li>
<li>Scanned the engineer's machine for secrets: GitHub tokens, AWS credentials, npm tokens, environment variables</li>
<li>Exfiltrated everything it found</li>
</ol>
<p>When the engineer later recovered files from their compromised laptop (booted in recovery mode), they found the telltale signs:</p>
<img src="https://trigger.dev/blog/shai-hulud-postmortem/screenshots/trufflehog.jpg" alt="TruffleHog artifacts found on compromised machine">
<p>The <code>.trufflehog-cache</code> directory and <code>trufflehog_3.91.1_darwin_amd64.tar.gz</code> file found on the compromised machine. The <code>extract</code> directory was empty, likely cleaned up by the malware to cover its tracks.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="17-hours-of-reconnaissance">17 hours of reconnaissance</h2>
<p>The attacker had access to our engineer's GitHub account for 17 hours before doing anything visible. According to our GitHub audit logs, they operated methodically.</p>
<p>Just over two hours after the initial compromise, the attacker validated their stolen credentials and began mass cloning:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Time (UTC)</th><th>Location</th><th>Activity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>22:36:50</td><td>US</td><td>First attacker access, mass cloning begins</td></tr><tr><td>22:36-22:39</td><td>US</td><td>73 repositories cloned</td></tr><tr><td>22:48-22:50</td><td>US</td><td>~70 more repositories cloned (second wave)</td></tr><tr><td>22:55-22:56</td><td>US</td><td>~90 repositories cloned (third wave)</td></tr><tr><td>22:59-23:04</td><td>US</td><td>~70 repositories cloned (fourth wave)</td></tr><tr><td>23:32:59</td><td>India</td><td>Attacker switches to India-based infrastructure</td></tr><tr><td>23:32-23:37</td><td>India</td><td>73 repositories cloned</td></tr><tr><td>23:34-23:35</td><td>US + India</td><td>Simultaneous cloning from both locations</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>The simultaneous activity from US and India confirmed we were dealing with a single attacker using multiple VPNs or servers, not separate actors.</p>
<p>While our engineer slept in Germany, the attacker continued their reconnaissance. More cloning at 02:56-02:59 UTC (middle of the night in Germany), sporadic activity until 05:32 UTC. Total repos cloned: 669 (527 from US infrastructure, 142 from India).</p>
<p>Here's where it gets unsettling. Our engineer woke up and started their normal workday:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Time (UTC)</th><th>Actor</th><th>Activity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>09:08:27</td><td>Engineer</td><td>Triggers workflow on cloud repo (from Germany)</td></tr><tr><td>09:10-09:17</td><td>Attacker</td><td>Git fetches from US, watching the engineer</td></tr><tr><td>09:08-15:08</td><td>Engineer</td><td>Normal PR reviews, CI workflows (from Germany)</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>The attacker was monitoring our engineer's activity while they worked, unaware they were compromised.</p>
<p>During this period, the attacker created repositories with random string names to store stolen credentials, a known Shai-Hulud pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>github.com/[username]/xfjqb74uysxcni5ztn</code></li>
<li><code>github.com/[username]/ls4uzkvwnt0qckjq27</code></li>
<li><code>github.com/[username]/uxa7vo9og0rzts362c</code></li>
</ul>
<p>They also created three repos marked with "Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming" as a calling card. These repositories were empty by the time we examined them, but based on the documented Shai-Hulud behavior, they likely contained triple base64-encoded credentials.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="10-minutes-of-destruction">10 minutes of destruction</h2>
<p>At 15:27 UTC on November 25th, the attacker switched from reconnaissance to destruction.</p>
<p>The attack began on our <code>cloud</code> repo from India-based infrastructure:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Time (UTC)</th><th>Event</th><th>Repo</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>15:27:35</td><td>First force-push</td><td>triggerdotdev/cloud</td><td>Attack begins</td></tr><tr><td>15:27:37</td><td>PR closed</td><td>triggerdotdev/cloud</td><td>PR #300 closed</td></tr><tr><td>15:27:44</td><td>BLOCKED</td><td>triggerdotdev/cloud</td><td>Branch protection rejected force-push</td></tr><tr><td>15:27:50</td><td>PR closed</td><td>triggerdotdev/trigger.dev</td><td>PR #2707 closed</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>The attack continued on our main repository:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Time (UTC)</th><th>Event</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>15:28:13</td><td>PR closed</td><td>triggerdotdev/trigger.dev PR #2706 (release PR)</td></tr><tr><td>15:30:51</td><td>PR closed</td><td>triggerdotdev/trigger.dev PR #2451</td></tr><tr><td>15:31:10</td><td>PR closed</td><td>triggerdotdev/trigger.dev PR #2382</td></tr><tr><td>15:31:16</td><td>BLOCKED</td><td>Branch protection rejected force-push to trigger.dev</td></tr><tr><td>15:31:31</td><td>PR closed</td><td>triggerdotdev/trigger.dev PR #2482</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

<h2 id="detection-and-response">Detection and response</h2>
<p>We got a lucky break. One of our team members was monitoring Slack when the flood of notifications started:</p>
<img src="https://trigger.dev/blog/shai-hulud-postmortem/screenshots/slack-notifications.png" alt="Slack notifications showing the attack">
<p>Our #git Slack channel during the attack. A wall of force-pushes, all with commit message "init."</p>
<p>Every malicious commit was authored as:</p>

<img src="https://trigger.dev/blog/shai-hulud-postmortem/screenshots/attacked-branch.png" alt="What an attacked branch looked like">
<p>An attacked branch: a single "init" commit attributed to Linus Torvalds, thousands of commits behind main.</p>
<p>We haven't found reports of other Shai-Hulud victims seeing this same "Linus Torvalds" vandalism pattern. The worm's documented behavior focuses on credential exfiltration and npm package propagation, not repository destruction. This destructive phase may have been unique to our attacker, or perhaps a manual follow-up action after the automated worm had done its credential harvesting.</p>
<p>Within 4 minutes of detection we identified the compromised account, removed them from the GitHub organization, and the attack stopped immediately.</p>
<p>Our internal Slack during those first minutes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Urmmm guys? what's going on?"</p>
<p>"add me to the call @here"</p>
<p>"Nick could you double check Infisical for any machine identities"</p>
<p>"can someone also check whether there are any reports of compromised packages in our CLI deps?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within the hour:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Time (UTC)</th><th>Action</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>~15:36</td><td>Removed from GitHub organization</td></tr><tr><td>~15:40</td><td>Removed from Infisical (secrets manager)</td></tr><tr><td>~15:45</td><td>Removed from AWS IAM Identity Center</td></tr><tr><td>~16:00</td><td>Removed from Vercel and Cloudflare</td></tr><tr><td>16:35</td><td>AWS SSO sessions blocked via deny policy (sessions can't be revoked)</td></tr><tr><td>16:45</td><td>IAM user console login deleted</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

<h2 id="the-damage">The damage</h2>
<p>Repository clone actions: 669 (public and private), including infrastructure code, internal documentation, and engineering plans.</p>
<p>Branches force-pushed: 199 across 16 repositories</p>
<p>Pull requests closed: 42</p>
<p>Protected branch rejections: 4. Some of our repositories have main branch protection enabled, but we had not enabled it for all repositories at the time of the incident.</p>
<p>npm packages were <strong>not</strong> compromised. This is the difference between "our repos got vandalized" and "our packages got compromised."</p>
<p>Our engineer didn't have an npm publishing token on their machine, and even if they did we had already required 2FA for publishing to npm. Without that, Shai-Hulud would have published malicious versions of <code>@trigger.dev/sdk</code>, <code>@trigger.dev/core</code>, and others, potentially affecting thousands of downstream users.</p>
<p>Production databases or any AWS resources were <strong>not</strong> accessed. Our AWS CloudTrail audit showed only read operations from the compromised account:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Event Type</th><th>Count</th><th>Service</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ListManagedNotificationEvents</td><td>~40</td><td>notifications</td></tr><tr><td>DescribeClusters</td><td>8</td><td>ECS</td></tr><tr><td>DescribeTasks</td><td>4</td><td>ECS</td></tr><tr><td>DescribeMetricFilters</td><td>6</td><td>CloudWatch</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>These were confirmed to be legitimate operations by our engineer.</p>
<p>One nice surprise: AWS actually sent us a proactive alert about Shai-Hulud. They detected the malware's characteristic behavior (ListSecrets, GetSecretValue, BatchGetSecretValue API calls) on an old test account that hadn't been used in months, so we just deleted it. But kudos to AWS for the proactive detection and notification.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-recovery">The recovery</h2>
<p>GitHub doesn't have server-side reflog. When someone force-pushes, that history is gone from GitHub's servers.</p>
<p>But we found ways to recover.</p>
<p>Push events are retained for 90 days via the GitHub Events API. We wrote a script that fetched pre-attack commit SHAs:</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span># Find pre-attack commit SHA from events</span></p></div><div><p><span>gh api repos/$REPO/events --paginate | \</span></p></div><div><p><span>  jq -r '.[] | select(.type=="PushEvent") |</span></p></div><div><p><span>  select(.payload.ref=="refs/heads/'$BRANCH'") |</span></p></div><div><p><span>  .payload.before' | head -1</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Public repository forks still contained original commits. We used these to verify and restore branches.</p>
<p>Developers who hadn't run <code>git fetch --prune</code> (all of us?) still had old SHAs in their local reflog.</p>
<p>Within 7 hours, all 199 branches were restored.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="github-app-private-key-exposure">GitHub app private key exposure</h2>
<p>During the investigation, our engineer was going through files recovered from the compromised laptop and discovered something concerning: the private key for our GitHub App was in the trash folder.</p>
<p>When you create a private key in the GitHub App settings, GitHub automatically downloads it. The engineer had created a key at some point, and while the active file had been deleted, it was still in the trash, potentially accessible to TruffleHog.</p>
<p>Our GitHub App has the following permissions on customer repositories:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Permission</th><th>Access Level</th><th>Risk</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>contents</td><td>read/write</td><td>Could read/write repository contents</td></tr><tr><td>pull_requests</td><td>read/write</td><td>Could read/create/modify PRs</td></tr><tr><td>deployments</td><td>read/write</td><td>Could create/trigger deployments</td></tr><tr><td>checks</td><td>read/write</td><td>Could create/modify check runs</td></tr><tr><td>commit_statuses</td><td>read/write</td><td>Could mark commits as passing/failing</td></tr><tr><td>metadata</td><td>read</td><td>Could read repository metadata</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>To generate valid access tokens, an attacker would need both the private key (potentially compromised) and the installation ID for a specific customer (stored in our database which was not compromised, not on the compromised machine).</p>
<p>We immediately rotated the key:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Time (UTC)</th><th>Action</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Nov 26, 18:51</td><td>Private key discovered in trash folder</td></tr><tr><td>Nov 26, 19:54</td><td>New key deployed to test environment</td></tr><tr><td>Nov 26, 20:16</td><td>New key deployed to production</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>We found no evidence of unauthorized access to any customer repositories. The attacker would have needed installation IDs from our database to generate tokens, and our database was not compromised as previously mentioned.</p>
<p>However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility. An attacker with the private key could theoretically have called the GitHub API to enumerate all installations. We've contacted GitHub Support to request additional access logs. We've also analyzed the webhook payloads to our GitHub app, looking for suspicious push or PR activity from connected installations &amp; repositories. We haven't found any evidence of unauthorized activity in these webhook payloads.</p>
<p>We've sent out an email to potentially effected customers to notify them of the incident with detailed instructions on how to check if they were affected. Please check your email for more details if you've used our GitHub app.</p>

<h2 id="technical-deep-dive-how-shai-hulud-works">Technical deep-dive: how Shai-Hulud works</h2>
<p>For those interested in the technical details, here's what we learned about the malware from <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/shai-hulud-strikes-again-v2">Socket's analysis</a> and our own investigation.</p>
<p>When npm runs the <code>preinstall</code> script, it executes <code>setup_bun.js</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Detects OS/architecture</li>
<li>Downloads or locates the <a href="https://bun.sh/">Bun</a> runtime</li>
<li>Caches Bun in <code>~/.cache</code></li>
<li>Spawns a detached Bun process running <code>bun_environment.js</code> with output suppressed</li>
<li>Returns immediately so <code>npm install</code> completes successfully with no warnings</li>
</ol>
<p>The malware runs in the background while you think everything is fine.</p>
<p>The payload uses TruffleHog to scan <code>$HOME</code> for GitHub tokens (from env vars, gh CLI config, git credential helpers), AWS/GCP/Azure credentials, npm tokens from <code>.npmrc</code>, environment variables containing anything that looks like a secret, and GitHub Actions secrets (if running in CI).</p>
<p>Stolen credentials are uploaded to a newly-created GitHub repo with a random name. The data is triple base64-encoded to evade GitHub's secret scanning.</p>
<p>Files created:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>contents.json</code> (system info and GitHub credentials)</li>
<li><code>environment.json</code> (all environment variables)</li>
<li><code>cloud.json</code> (cloud provider credentials)</li>
<li><code>truffleSecrets.json</code> (filesystem secrets from TruffleHog)</li>
<li><code>actionsSecrets.json</code> (GitHub Actions secrets if any)</li>
</ul>
<p>If an npm publishing token is found, the malware validates the token against the npm registry, fetches packages maintained by that account, downloads each package, patches it with the malware, bumps the version, and re-publishes, infecting more packages.</p>
<p>This is how the worm spread through the npm ecosystem, starting from <a href="https://posthog.com/blog/nov-24-shai-hulud-attack-post-mortem">PostHog's compromised CI</a> on November 24th at 4:11 AM UTC. Our engineer was infected roughly 16 hours after the malicious packages went live.</p>
<p>If no credentials are found to exfiltrate or propagate, the malware attempts to delete the victim's entire home directory. Scorched earth.</p>
<p>File artifacts to look for: <code>setup_bun.js</code>, <code>bun_environment.js</code>, <code>cloud.json</code>, <code>contents.json</code>, <code>environment.json</code>, <code>truffleSecrets.json</code>, <code>actionsSecrets.json</code>, <code>.trufflehog-cache/</code> directory.</p>
<p>Malware file hashes (SHA1):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bun_environment.js</code>: <code>d60ec97eea19fffb4809bc35b91033b52490ca11</code></li>
<li><code>bun_environment.js</code>: <code>3d7570d14d34b0ba137d502f042b27b0f37a59fa</code></li>
<li><code>setup_bun.js</code>: <code>d1829b4708126dcc7bea7437c04d1f10eacd4a16</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We've published a <a href="https://gist.github.com/ericallam/e2ae497d99a21d500fd9fbb01e1bfa02">detection script</a> that checks for Shai-Hulud indicators.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-weve-changed">What we've changed</h2>
<p>We disabled npm scripts globally:</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>npm config set ignore-scripts true --location=global</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>This prevents <code>preinstall</code>, <code>postinstall</code>, and other lifecycle scripts from running. It's aggressive and some packages will break, but it's the only reliable protection against this class of attack.</p>
<p>We upgraded to pnpm 10. This was significant effort (had to migrate through pnpm 9 first), but pnpm 10 brings critical security improvements. Scripts are ignored by default. You can explicitly whitelist packages that need to run scripts via <code>pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies</code>. And the <code>minimumReleaseAge</code> setting prevents installing packages published recently.</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span># pnpm-workspace.yaml</span></p></div><div><p><span>minimumReleaseAge: 4320 # 3 days in minutes</span></p></div><div><p><span>preferOffline: true</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>To whitelist packages that legitimately need build scripts:</p>

<p>This prompts you to select which packages to allow (like <code>esbuild</code>, <code>prisma</code>, <code>sharp</code>).</p>
<p>For your global pnpm config:</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>pnpm config set minimumReleaseAge 4320</span></p></div><div><p><span>pnpm config set --json minimumReleaseAgeExclude '["@trigger.dev/*", "trigger.dev"]'</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>We switched npm publishing to OIDC. No more long-lived npm tokens anywhere. Publishing now uses <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers">npm's trusted publishers</a> with GitHub Actions OIDC. Even if an attacker compromises a developer machine, they can't publish packages because there are no credentials to steal. Publishing only happens through CI with short-lived, scoped tokens.</p>
<p>We enabled branch protection on all repositories. Not just critical repos or just OSS repos. Every repository with meaningful code now has branch protection enabled.</p>
<p>We've adopted <a href="https://docs.commonfate.io/granted/introduction">Granted</a> for AWS SSO. Granted encrypts SSO session tokens on the client side, unlike the AWS CLI which stores them in plaintext.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://posthog.com/blog/nov-24-shai-hulud-attack-post-mortem">PostHog's analysis</a> of how they were initially compromised (via <code>pull_request_target</code>), we've reviewed our GitHub Actions workflows. We now require approval for external contributor workflow runs on all our repositories (previous policy was only for public repositories).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="lessons-for-other-teams">Lessons for other teams</h2>
<p>The ability for packages to run arbitrary code during installation is the attack surface. Until npm fundamentally changes, add this to your <code>~/.npmrc</code>:</p>

<p>Yes, some things will break. Whitelist them explicitly. The inconvenience is worth it.</p>
<p>pnpm 10 ignores scripts by default and lets you set a minimum age for packages:</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>pnpm config set minimumReleaseAge 4320  # 3 days</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Newly published packages can't be installed for 3 days, giving time for malicious packages to be detected.</p>
<p>Branch protection takes 30 seconds to enable. It prevents attackers from pushing to a main branch, potentially executing malicious GitHub action workflows.</p>
<p>Long-lived npm tokens on developer machines are a liability. Use <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers">trusted publishers</a> with OIDC instead.</p>
<p>If you don't need a credential on your local machine, don't have it there. Publishing should happen through CI only.</p>
<p>Our #git Slack channel is noisy. That noise saved us.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-note-on-the-human-side">A note on the human side</h2>
<p>One of the hardest parts of this incident was that it happened to a person.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sorry for all the trouble guys, terrible experience"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our compromised engineer felt terrible, even though they did absolutely nothing wrong. It could have happened to any team member.</p>
<p>Running <code>npm install</code> is not negligence. Installing dependencies is not a security failure. The security failure is in an ecosystem that allows packages to run arbitrary code silently.</p>
<p>They also discovered that the attacker had made their GitHub account star hundreds of random repositories during the compromise. Someone even emailed us: "hey you starred my repo but I think it was because you were hacked, maybe remove the star?"</p>

I already have a flight to see her in four days and I’m not sure it’s worth moving. This isn’t the first time she’s been in the ICU; for years she’s been in and out of hospitals and stuff that used to make us panic now makes us go ‘oh darn, again?’</p><p>I ask, How serious is it? The answers are fuzzy, and I am frustrated. I ask my dad to ask the doctor if she thinks family should come. I get the message: “Doc says yes come immediately.”</p><p>Five hours later, my sister and I are landing in Boise. We stop by my parents’ house to grab my mom’s car; I collect photos, a blanket I made her, a little stuffed otter. My mom loves otters. I haven’t thought too hard about her dying, I don’t know if she’s going to die, but everything we’re doing feels important in a way I haven’t felt before. We’re shaky.</p><p>We park in the freezing Idaho hospital parking lot at 1 am; my sister says it feels like we’re walking through a fiery gate into doom. She’s right, we’re bracing. The edges of reality begin to pulse.</p><p>The front desk gives us wristbands, and we begin the long winding walk to the ICU. At the end of the big hall stands my dad and an old family friend I haven’t seen in years. She hugs us and says “I’m gonna warn you, it’s shocking.” She says, “I’m so sorry, girls.”</p><p>We get into the ICU, they make us wash our hands. A nurse preps us, says our mom can hear us but will be unresponsive. Our mom might move, but this is instinctual and not conscious.</p><p>We go in. My mom is barely recognizeable, shriveled down like her soul is half gone and her flesh is deflating around the space it’s leaving behind. She’s got a tube in her throat and out her arms and neck, wires all over her head. She’s handcuffed to the bed so she doesn’t tear out the ventilator.</p><p>My sister and I hold her hands and cry. We speak to her, but there’s no movement, not even twitching. We sob ‘i love you’ over and over. </p><p>My dad’s been sleeping in the hospital. We tell him he should go home, he’s barely slept in days, we’ll keep watch over her. He leaves, but we can’t sleep; we sit by her side for hours, staring at her, talking to her. I read her sweet messages sent by people who love her. </p><p>I put the blanket I made on her. I’d given it to her last time I visited, two weeks ago. She squealed like a delighted child, but her brain wasn’t working, and she quickly forgot. Any time she seemed distressed, I’d just give her the blanket again - “Look mom, I crocheted this for you” - and she’d drop everything and squeal again, and clutch it to her chest. I got to give it to her probably five times. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png" width="346" height="368.5861111111111" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:767,&quot;width&quot;:720,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:346,&quot;bytes&quot;:1038465,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://aella.substack.com/i/179892510?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>We sleep in the room with her, a few hours here and there. I keep waking up with adrenaline every time her monitor beeps, but no changes. Doctors come in and brush her teeth and rotate her body a little. </p><p><span>I remember hearing other people say the phrase “Nobody knew what to do” during crises, but I’d always assumed it was a paralysis around what to do with important decisions like ‘do we keep them alive’ or ‘what do we do with the body’. But here, in the middle of it, I realize it applies to </span><em>everything</em><span>. I can’t think at all. The part of our brain that does evaluation, desire, and choice has been completely overrun; when someone asks “I’m gonna grab sushi, do you want any” we stare at them in confusion. I keep saying ‘sure, I guess’ at food offers, and the little room accumulates </span><em>way</em><span> too much food that slowly goes bad over days. It’s hard to know when to sleep, or when to trade shifts - we should probably take shifts, right? Nobody has a sleep schedule, we’re running on a few hours each night. All I can remember is that when I got there, I thought at least one of us should be well rested at any given time. It’s hard to track that now. We’re disorganized, our half-unpacked suitcases spill everywhere. The air is different. We keep the blinds to the window closed because my dad has autism, and so we can’t see the sun passing; the only sense of time passing is the pulses of nurse activity outside the door and their shift changes. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg" width="516" height="305.187648456057" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:747,&quot;width&quot;:1263,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:516,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>We’ve fallen into a crack in reality, a place where the veil is thin and the water is still, while the world continues to eddy around us through the hallways outside.</p><p><span>The doctors come in and give us updates, frustratingly vague.

I grow impatient. I am afraid that if my sister takes too long to get here, my mom might start improving, and ‘taking her off life support’ would no longer be an option. Her surviving is a horrifying option; her life has already been constant suffering before this, and the damage to her body now would mean if she did survive, her quality of life would somehow be even </span><em>lower</em><span>. She’s only 66, but she’s been saying she’s ready to die for a long time. </span></p><p>But despite knowing she would not want to survive this, I watch myself pore over her medical records, trying to figure out if there’s anything we can do to keep her alive. I don’t know why I’m doing this. I am looking for an escape from her incoming death, even though I know I couldn’t take it if I found it. It keeps distracting me, I keep impulsively lurching towards it and having to stop myself.</p><p>I find I am possessed by gentleness, my movements are heavy with care. I touch her hands delicately, I brush her hair, I kiss her forehead, I tuck the blankets around her just right. I am shocked at how powerful this urge is, it doesn’t feel like a choice. I’ve been hollowed out by love. My care for her seems like clearly the realest thing. All other things in my life I thought I cared about turn into faint shadows in the face of this. It feels like I’m made out of a billion tiny particles that are all pointing in the same direction. It’s here that I am full. Despite my lack of sleep and my grief, I am a white hot light.

We stand around her unresponsive body and tell stories about her life. One time there was a hornet’s nest in the back yard, and she went out with a fire extinguisher, determined to kill them all. She held up the nozzle, aimed carefully, and sprayed - but the nozzle was turned backwards, and it went all into her face. We howl as my sister describes her coming back in the house, her hair frizzed out with the white powder. </p><p>I’d gotten an airbnb near the hospital, but I end up napping there only twice - once in the middle of the day, when the room was full of people, and again, the night before we kill her. My other sister had finally gotten in from overseas and we let her sleep in the room the final night.</p><p>As the scheduled time draws near, everything starts to feel different. Each passing minute is a greater percentage of the final minutes we have with her, getting compressed down, heating under the pressure. By the final morning, the contractions have started. We gather in the room for the last time. </p><p>We all leave the room to allow each one of us to say our goodbyes in privacy. When it’s my turn I go in and it’s her and I, alone. I’d already talked to her in the past blurry days, in the middle of the night when everyone was gone or sleeping in corners I sat by her bedside, holding her precious hand and whispering to her. But this is the last time. I tell her she was a wonderful mom. The walls are twisting in, squeezing the words out of me. I tell her I’m sad we ended up such different people, in a tragic, inevitable way that put distance between us. I tell her I’ll miss her. I tell her many other tender things that were for her ears alone. Each second is so loud; there’s so few of them left, and they are screaming. </p><p>Finally we’ve all said our words, and crowd back in. We hold her, we tell the doctors we’re ready. We are shaking. I don’t know what to do. We can’t do anything. They tell us they’re going to remove the ventilator, that we can step out if we want. We all say no. Leaving would be profane. I need to be with her through every second of this. I watch them gently unstrap things around her face, press buttons. They say after they take it out, she will probably die quickly. The ground is rumbling beneath us, the air is bearing down; I think my sister is going to pass out and I manage to pull her into a chair. They lay out a napkin below my mom’s chin. “One, two, three,” says a nurse, and they pull it out, the long tube that comes out with a wet noise. An immense, familiar agony is tearing through my body, starting in my lower gut and pulsing out through my arms and pouring out from my hands and the top of my head and the water from my eyes. The final descent shudders with holiness. The air itself is crying out with a chorus of our primal cries, we have no control over our bodies. She’s on her own now, and she is dying. My sister is sobbing “Momma, I love you”. We feel for her pulse, can’t tell if the beat we feel is our own hearts in our hands or if it’s hers. I put my fingers under her nose, feel the faintest air for a moment, and then I can’t feel any more. A moment later the doctors come in - they’d been watching her heart from the outside - and tell us she’s gone.</p><p><span>Almost immediately, a calmness washes over the Crack in Reality, and we sit back, and reality releases its contraction. I’m surprised by how fast the change is; I thought maybe </span><em>now</em><span> is when it would be the worst, but these seconds are so soft. We cry softly, and hold her body softly, and watch the blood start to pool on the underside of her arms and the bottom of her tongue. She looks like the renassaince paintings of dead bodies, and I wonder how many loved ones those old painters had watched die. My sister crawls into bed with her and wraps her arms around our mom’s body. I am hyper aware of the blood moving in my body, the pink under my own skin. </span></p><p>This is so weird. I talk to her, but it feels different now. We are in the aftershocks. Her body is a symbol; like her rings we saved, the little locks of her hair we cut, the photos we took of her; her body is like that, now, just heavier. </p><p>We spend three more hours in the room before we’re ready to leave the Crack in Reality. We collect our things, and the blanket, and the otter. Leaving her alone seems wrong; I put the stuffed animal in the crook of her arm, wrapping her arms around it, I say she can’t be alone, the otter needs to stay with her so that she’s not alone. This makes no sense; it doesn’t matter, I am sobbing, my love has nowhere to go and so it is leaking out, forcing any action it can through the cracks.</p><p><span>But then I leave, we all leave, dazed and raw, and time goes on. It just keeps going. It goes through her letters, old photos, the funeral, the gathering afterwards. It goes through moments of grief and moments of strange disassociative normality. It goes through dark jokes, and old bitter stories, and sentimental talismans. It goes back out of Idaho, maybe for the last time. It goes through memories slamming into me when I’m trying to sleep, and then through nights of good sleep, and new moments of forgetting. And now that crack in reality lies as a faint shadow over my shoulder. But I can </span><em>see</em><span> it still, like it’s a room in my house. Maybe one day I’ll end up back there.</span></p><p>My mom was the opposite of me in almost every way two humans can be opposite. She was traditional and uncomplicated; she once complained to me she didn’t like these new shows that portrayed the bad guy as sympathetic, that was a level of moral nuance she did not appreciate. She was so devoutly religious, most of you probably cannot actually imagine how much; she loved worshipping Jesus and putting crosses on everything she could. Years ago I asked “when you were little, what did you want to be when you grew up?” and she said “a mom.” She, as far as I know, had one sexual partner her entire life. </p><p>I think it’s then particularly remarkable that she still loved me - a famous atheist prostitute. Our relationship was hard because she didn’t want to hear about my life, and all my projects were in some way sex related - but that was the most it ever got in the way. She never tried to make me feel bad or pressure me. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png" width="316" height="182" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:182,&quot;width&quot;:316,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:9696,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://aella.substack.com/i/179892510?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>She was far from perfect, but for all her flaws she managed to channel an unconditional love made all the more beautiful by how hard it would be for most people like her to love most daughters like me. In my years I’ve met many a sex worker who talked about being disowned by her Christian mom, but my mom wasn’t that kind of Christian. She was a good one.</p><p>A mother’s love is crazy. She poured it all out into my earliest years, when I was still forming in the world. I will forever be shaped by it. It’s hard to look at the intensity of that love directly. It’s blinding. It sort of doesn’t matter who I grew into being, or ways we missed seeing each other each other - she and I are linked at the souls. It’s a heavy thing to be loved so fiercely.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>“Compiler Engineering in Practice” is a blog series intended to pass on wisdom that seemingly every seasoned compiler developer knows, but is not systematically written down in any textbook or online resource. Some (but not much) prior experience with compilers is needed.</p>



<p>The first and most important question is “what is a compiler?”. In short, a compiler is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a <em>translator</em> that translates between two different languages, where those languages represent a description of a computation, and</li>
  <li>the behavior of the computation in the output language must “match” the behavior of the computation in the input language (more on this below).</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, an input language can be C, and the output can be x86 assembly. By this definition, an assembler is also a compiler (albeit a simple one), in that it reads x86 textual assembly and outputs x86 binary machine code, which are two different languages. The <code>python</code> program that executes Python code contains a compiler – one that reads Python source code and outputs Python interpreter bytecode.</p>

<p>This brings me to my first important point about practical compiler engineering – it’s not some mystical art. Compilers, operating systems, and databases are usually considered some kind of special corner of computer science / software engineering for being complex, and indeed, there are some corners of compilers that are a black art. But taking a step back, a compiler is simply a program that reads a  file and writes a file. From a development perspective, it’s not that different from <code>cat</code> or <code>grep</code>.</p>

<p>Why does this matter? Because it means that compilers are <em>easy to debug if you build them right</em>. There are no time-dependent interrupts like an operating system, async external events like a web browser, or large enough scale that hardware has to be considered unreliable like a database. It’s just a command line program (or can be reduced to one if engineered right), such that nearly all bugs are reproducible and debuggable in isolation <em>from the comfort of your workstation</em>. No connecting to a flaky dev board, no extensive mocking of various interfaces.</p>

<p>You might say – wait a minute – if I’m running on my company’s AI hardware, I may need to connect to a dev board. Yes, but if you do things right, you will rarely need to do that when debugging the compiler proper. Which brings me to…</p>

<h2 id="reliability">Reliability</h2>

<p>Compilers <em>are</em> like operating systems and databases in that the bar for reliability is extremely high. One cannot build a practical compiler haphazardly. Why? Because of miscompiles.</p>

<p>Miscompiles are when the compiler produces an output file in the output language that does not “match” the specification of its computation in the input language. To avoid a miscompile, the output program must behave identically to the input program, as far as can be observed by the outside world, such as network requests, values printed to the console, values written to files, etc.</p>

<p>For integer programs, bit-exact results are required, though there are some nuances regarding undefined behavior, as described in John Regehr’s <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/the-undef-story/45417/42">“laws of physics of compilers”</a>. For floating point programs, the expectation of bit-exact results is usually too strict. Transformations on large floating point computations (like AI programs) need some flexibility to produce slightly different outputs in order to allow efficient execution. There is no widely-agreed-upon formal definition of this, though there are reasonable ways to check for it in practice (<a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.isclose.html">“atol/rtol”</a> go a long way).</p>

<h3 id="how-bad-is-a-miscompile">How bad is a miscompile?</h3>

<p>Miscompiles can have massive consequences for customers. A miscompile of a database can cause data loss. A miscompile of an operating system can cause a security vulnerability. A miscompile of an AI program can cause bad medical advice. The stakes are extremely high, and debugging a miscompile when it happens “in the wild” can easily take 3+ months (and it can take months for a customer to even realize that their issue is caused by a miscompile).</p>

<p>If that weren’t enough, there’s a self-serving reason to avoid miscompiles – if you have too many of them, your development velocity on your compiler will grind to a halt. Miscompiles can easily take 100x or 1000x of the time to debug vs a bug that makes itself known during the actual execution of the compiler (rather than the execution of the program that was output by the compiler). That’s why most aspects of practical compiler development revolve around ensuring that if something goes wrong, that it <em>halts the compiler before a faulty output program is produced</em>.</p>

<p>A miscompile is a fundamental failure of the compiler’s contract with its user. Every miscompile should be accompanied by a deep look in the mirror and self-reflection about what went wrong to allow it to sneak through, and what preventative measures can (and should immediately) be taken to ensure that this particular failure mode never happens again.</p>

<p>Especially in the AI space, there are lots of compilers that play fast and loose with this, and as a result get burned. The best compiler engineers tend to be highly pedantic and somewhat paranoid about what can go wrong.</p>

<h2 id="why-compilers-are-hard--the-ir-data-structure">Why compilers are hard – the IR data structure</h2>

<p>Compilers do have an essential complexity that makes them “hard”, and this again comes from the whole business of making sure that the input program and the output of the compiler have the same behavior. To understand this, we have to discuss how a compiler represents the <em>meaning</em> of the input program and how it preserves that meaning when producing the output program. This notion of “meaning” is sometimes called the <em>program semantics</em>.</p>

<p>The primary data structure in a compiler is usually some form of graph data structure that represents the compiler’s understanding of “what computation this program is supposed to do”. Hence, it represents the computation that the compiler needs to preserve all the way to the output program. This data structure is usually called an IR (intermediate representation). The primary way that compilers work is by taking an IR that represents the input program, and applying a series of small transformations all of which have been individually verified to not change the meaning of the program (i.e. not miscompile). In doing so, we decompose one large translation problem into many smaller ones, making it manageable.</p>

<p>I think it’s fair to say that compiler IR’s are the single most complex monolithic data structure in all of software engineering, in the sense that interpreting what can and cannot be validly done with the data structure is complex. To be clear, compiler IR’s are not usually very complex in the implementation sense like a “lock-free list” that uses subtle atomic operations to present a simple insert/delete/etc. interface.</p>

<p>Unlike a lock-free list, compiler IR’s usually have a very complex interface, even if they have a very simple internal implementation. Even specifying declaratively or in natural language what are the allowed transformations on the data structure is usually extremely difficult (you’ll see things like “memory models” or “abstract machines” that people spend <em>years or decades</em> trying to define properly).</p>

<h3 id="a-very-complex-schema">A very complex schema</h3>

<p>Firstly, the nodes in the graph usually have a complex schema. For example, a simple “integer multiply operation” (a node in the graph) is only allowed to have certain integer types as operands (incoming edges). And there may easily be thousands of kinds of operations at varying abstraction levels in any practical compiler, each with their own unique requirements. For example, a simple C <code>*</code> (multiplication) operator will go through the following evolution in Clang:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It first becomes Clang’s <code>BinaryOperator</code> node, which takes two “expressions” as operands (which may be mutable uint32_t values, for example).</li>
  <li>It will then be converted to an LLVM IR <code>mul</code> operation, which takes as operands an <code>llvm::Value</code>, which represents an immutable value of the <code>i32</code> type, say.</li>
  <li>It will then be converted to a GlobalISel <code>G_MUL</code> operation, whose operands represent not only an 32-bit integer, but also begin to capture notions like which “register bank” the value should eventually live in.</li>
  <li>It will then be turned into a target-specific MIR node like <code>IMUL32rri</code> or <code>IMUL32rr</code> selecting among a variety of physical x86 instructions which can implement a multiplication. At this level, operands may represent physical, mutable hardware registers.</li>
</ul>

<p>From a compiler developer’s perspective, all these “multiply operations” are deeply different from each other because of the different information captured at each abstraction level (again, compiler developers are usually very pedantic). Failing to adequately differentiate between abstraction levels is a common disease among poorly written compilers.</p>

<p>At every level, precise attention to detail is needed – for example, if the multiplication is expected to overflow mod 2^32 in the source program, and we accidentally convert it to overflow mod 2^64 (such as by using a 64-bit register), then we have introduced a miscompile. Each operation has its own unique set of constraints and properties like these which apply when transforming the program.</p>

<h3 id="complex-interactions-between-operations">Complex interactions between operations</h3>

<p>Additionally, how these operations in the IR graph relate to each other can be very complex, especially when mutable variables and control flow are involved. For example, you may realize that an operation always executes, but we may be able to move it around to hide it under an <code>if</code> condition to optimize the program. Consider the program:</p>

<pre><code>x = y + z;
...
if (condition) {
    print(x); // The only time that `x` is referenced.
}
</code></pre>
<p>Is it safe to convert this to</p>
<pre><code>...
if (condition) {
    print(y + z);
}
</code></pre>
<p>? Well, it depends on what’s hidden in that <code>...</code>. For example, if the program is:</p>
<pre><code>x = y + z;
...
y += 5;
...
if (condition) {
    print(x);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then it’s not legal, since by the time we get to the <code>if</code>, the value of <code>y</code> will have changed and we’ll print the wrong value. One of the primary considerations when designing compiler IR’s is how to make the transformations as simple and obviously correct as possible (more on that in another blog post).</p>

<p>Usually production compilers will deal with IR graphs from thousands to millions of nodes. Understandably then, the compounding effect of the IR complexity is front and center in all compiler design discussions. A single invalid transformation can result in a miscompile.</p>

<h2 id="compilers-are-just-software">Compilers are just software</h2>

<p>Practical compilers are often live for years or decades and span millions of lines of code, so the entire suite of software engineering wisdom applies to them – good API design, testing, reusability, etc. though usually with additional compiler-specific twists.</p>

<p>For example, while API design is very important for most programs’ code (as it is for compilers’), compilers also have an additional dimension of “IR design”. As described above, the IR can be very complex to understand and transform, and designing it right can greatly mitigate this. (more on this in a future blog post)</p>

<p>Similarly, since compilers are usually decomposed into the successive application of multiple “passes” (self-contained IR transformations), there are a variety of testing and debugging strategies specific to compilers. (more on this in a future blog post).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're just going to call it: up until recently, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cursor.com/" target="_blank">cursor.com</a> was powered by Sanity as its CMS.</p><p>Then Lee Robinson sat down and spent 344 agent requests and around $260 to migrate the content and setup to <!--$?--><template id="B:0"></template>markdown<!--/$--> files, GitHub, Vercel, and a vibe-coded media management interface.</p><p>He did <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://leerob.com/agents" target="_blank">a great write-up of the process on his blog</a>. He was classy and didn't name us.</p><p>Of course, when a high-profile customer moves off your product and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://x.com/leerob/status/1867513884382597485" target="_blank">the story resonates with builders you respect</a>, you pay attention.</p><p>The weird twist here is that we sort of agree with Lee’s take. He has a lot of great points. The conversation around complexity and abstractions that a <span>headless CMS</span> brings reflects real frustration. The way things have been done for the past decade deserved criticism.</p><p>But Lee's post doesn't tell the full story. We see what people are trying to solve when it comes to content every day. We live and breathe this CMS stuff. So let us add some context.</p><p>The headless CMS industry built complexity that didn't deliver proportional value for many. This is true.</p><p>Preview workflows are clunky. Draft modes, toolbar toggles, account requirements just to see what your content looks like before it goes live. Having to add data attributes everywhere to connect front ends with backend fields feels unnecessary.  Real friction for something that feels it should be simple.</p><p>Auth fragmentation is annoying. CMS login. GitHub login. Hosting provider login. Three systems to get a preview working.</p><p>Their CDN costs was largely caused by hosting a video from our file storage. It’s not an ideal way to host videos in front of Cursor’s massive audience. We should have made it more obvious that there are better and cheaper ways, like using the Mux plugin.</p><p>332K lines of code was removed in exchange for 43K new ones. That sounds a great win. We love getting rid of code too. </p><p>And here's the one that actually matters: AI agents couldn't easily reach content behind authenticated APIs. When your coding agent can grep your codebase but can't query your CMS, that's a real problem. Lee felt this friction and responded to it. (We did too, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mcp.sanity.io/" target="_blank">the new very capable MCP server is out</a>).</p><p>These complaints are valid. We're not going to pretend otherwise. </p><p>Here's the thing though. Read his post carefully and look at what he ended up with:</p><ul><li>An asset management GUI (built with "3-4 prompts," which, to be fair, is impressive)</li><li>User management via GitHub permissions</li><li><!--$?--><template id="B:1"></template>Version control<!--/$--> via git</li><li>Localization tooling</li><li>A <!--$?--><template id="B:2"></template>content model<!--/$--> (markdown frontmatter with specific fields)</li></ul><p>These are CMS features. Distributed across npm scripts, GitHub's permission system, and Vercel's infrastructure.</p><p>The features exist because the problems are real. You can delete the CMS, but you can't delete the need to manage assets, control who can publish what, track changes, and structure your content for reusability and distribution at scale.</p><p>Give it six months. The bespoke tooling will grow. The edge cases will multiply. Someone will need to schedule a post. Someone will need to preview on mobile. Someone will want to revert a change from three weeks ago and git reflog won't cut it. The "simple" system will accrete complexity because content management <em>is</em> complex.</p><p>Even with agents. Who were mostly trained within the constraints of these patterns.</p><p>Lee's model is clean: one markdown file equals one page. Simple. Grep-able.</p><p>This works until it doesn't.</p><h3 id="5xtauv"><a title="Copy link to heading" href="https://www.sanity.io/blog/you-should-never-build-a-cms#5xtauv">The content === page trap</a></h3><p>What happens when your pricing lives in three places? The pricing page, the comparison table, the footer CTA. In markdown-land, you update three files. Or you build a templating system that pulls from a canonical source. At which point you've invented content references. At which point you're building a CMS.</p><p>What happens when legal needs to update the compliance language that appears on 47 pages? You grep for the old string and replace it. Except the string has slight variations. Except someone reworded it slightly on the enterprise page. Except now you need to verify each change because regex can't understand intent. Now you are building a CMS.</p><p>What happens when you want to know "where is this product mentioned?" You can grep for the product name. You can't grep for "content that references this product entity" because markdown doesn't have entities. It has strings. </p><p>Suddenly you’re parsing thousands of files on every build to check for broken links (that you can’t query). And yes, you are building a CMS.</p><p>Structured content breaks the content = page assumption on purpose. A product is a document. A landing page document references that product and both are rendered together on the website. And in an app. And the support article for that product. When the product information changes, that changes is reflected in all these places. When you need to find every mention, you query the references, not the strings.</p><p>Engineers understand this. It's normalization. It's the same reason you don't store <code>customer_name</code> as a string in every order row. You store a <code>customer_id</code> and join.</p><p><strong>Markdown files are the content equivalent of denormalized strings everywhere. It works for small datasets. It becomes a maintenance nightmare at scale.</strong></p><h3 id="5xtavo"><a title="Copy link to heading" href="https://www.sanity.io/blog/you-should-never-build-a-cms#5xtavo">Git is not a content collaboration tool</a></h3><p>Git is a version control system built for code. Code has specific properties that make git work well:</p><ul><li>Merge conflicts are mechanical. Two people edited the same function. The resolution is structural.</li><li>Line-based diffing makes sense. Code is organized in lines that map to logical units.</li><li>Branching maps to features. You branch to build something, then merge when it's done.</li><li>Async is fine. You don't need to see someone else's changes until they push.</li></ul><p>Content has different properties:</p><ul><li>Merge conflicts are semantic. Two people edited the same paragraph with different intentions. The "correct" merge requires understanding what both people <em>meant</em>.</li><li>Line-based diffing is arbitrary. A paragraph rewrite shows as one changed line that actually changes everything. If you have block content (like Notion) this breaks apart even more.</li><li>Branching doesn't map to content workflows. "I'm working on the Q3 campaign" isn't a branch. It's 30 pieces of content across 12 pages with 4 people contributing.</li><li>Real-time matters. When your content team is distributed, "I'm editing this doc" needs to be visible <em>now</em>, not after a commit and push. Even more so with AI automation and agents in the mix.</li></ul><p>None of this is git's fault. Git solved the problem it was built for brilliantly. Content collaboration isn't that problem.</p><p>We know this because every team that scales content on git builds the same workarounds:</p><ul><li>Lock files or Slack conversations to prevent simultaneous editing</li><li>"I'm working on X, don't touch it" announcements</li><li>Elaborate PR review processes that become bottlenecks</li><li>Content freezes before launches because merge complexity is too high</li></ul><p>Sound familiar? These are the problems CMSes were built to solve. Real-time collaboration. Conflict-free editing. Workflow states that aren't git branches.</p><p>Lee's core argument: AI agents can now grep the codebase, so content should live in the codebase.</p><p>This sounds reasonable until you think about what grep actually does. It's string matching. Pattern finding. It's great for "find all files containing X."</p><p>It's not great for:</p><ul><li>"All blog posts mentioning feature Y published after September"</li><li>"Products with price &gt; $100 that are in stock"</li><li>"Content tagged 'enterprise' that hasn't been translated to German yet"</li><li>"The three most recent case studies in the finance category"</li></ul><p>Here's what that last one looks like in GROQ:</p><p>Try writing that as a grep command against markdown files. You can't. You'd need to parse frontmatter, understand your date format, resolve the category references, handle the sorting, limit the results. At which point you've built a query engine.</p><p>Structured content with a real <!--$?--><template id="B:4"></template>query language<!--/$--> is what agents actually need to reason about content. Markdown files are <em>less</em> queryable than a proper content API, not more.</p><p>The irony here is thick. Lee's argument for moving to code is that agents can work with code. But agents are better at working with structured data and APIs than they are at parsing arbitrary file formats and grepping for strings. That's not a limitation of current AI. That's just how information retrieval works.</p><p>Here's what we think Lee got backwards: the solution to "my agent can't access my CMS" isn't "delete the CMS." It's "give your agent access to the CMS."</p><p>It was also bad timing. Our MCP server wasn't good enough when Lee tried it.</p><p>But we fixed it. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mcp.sanity.io/" target="_blank">Our new MCP server is out now</a>.</p><p>Your coding agent can now create new content projects, query your content, create documents, update schemas, and manage releases. All through the same interface you're already using to build everything else. You never have to see any CMS UI unless you want to.</p><p>Schema, queryable content. From prompts. In about 10 minutes from start to deployed. You can ask it to generate images of those cars too.</p><figure data-type="muxVideo2"><p><img sizes="100vw" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://image.mux.com/fOG02RAwwy00Z4eqtBlOYIQGSvZ4GWUEKC/thumbnail.webp?time=0" srcset="https://image.mux.com/fOG02RAwwy00Z4eqtBlOYIQGSvZ4GWUEKC/thumbnail.webp?time=0&amp;width=200 200w, https://image.mux.com/fOG02RAwwy00Z4eqtBlOYIQGSvZ4GWUEKC/thumbnail.webp?time=0&amp;width=400 400w, https://image.mux.com/fOG02RAwwy00Z4eqtBlOYIQGSvZ4GWUEKC/thumbnail.webp?time=0&amp;width=600 600w, https://image.mux.com/fOG02RAwwy00Z4eqtBlOYIQGSvZ4GWUEKC/thumbnail.webp?time=0&amp;width=800 800w, https://image.mux.com/fOG02RAwwy00Z4eqtBlOYIQGSvZ4GWUEKC/thumbnail.webp?time=0&amp;width=1200 1200w, https://image.mux.com/fOG02RAwwy00Z4eqtBlOYIQGSvZ4GWUEKC/thumbnail.webp?time=0&amp;width=1600 1600w"></p></figure><p>You can also use it for content inquires like this:</p><p>The agent queries your actual schema and returns actionable results. Not string matches. Actual documents with their field states.</p><p>The agent checks your existing schema, generates compatible additions, and can deploy them. No tab-switching to documentation. No copy-pasting boilerplate.</p><p>This is what "agents working with content" actually looks like. Not grep. A query language. Not editing markdown. Operating on structured data through proper APIs. Not string matching. Semantic understanding of your content model.</p><p>Here’s something we should acknowledge: LLMs are good at markdown. They were trained on massive amounts of it. The format is token-efficient compared to JSON and XML. When you ask an agent to write or edit prose, markdown is a reasonable output format. </p><p>This is real. It’s part of why Lee’s migration worked.</p><p>But there is a difference between “good format for LLM I/O” and “good format for content infrastructure.”</p><p>LLMs are also good at SQL (they even now GROQ fairly well when you remind them). That doesn’t mean you should store your database as .sql files in git and have agents grep them. The query language and the storage layer are different concerns.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/02/thoughts-on-markdown/" target="_blank">I wrote about this three years ago in Smashing Magazine</a>, before LLMs changed everything. The arguments still hold: you can’t query markdown, structured content is more tinker-able, and hosting content in a database doesn’t mean you own it less. </p><p>What’s changed is that we now have agents that can work with both formats. The question is which architecture sets them up to do more.</p><p>Let's be fair about scope. Cursor’s setup works for cursor.com right now because:</p><ul><li>Their entire team writes code. "Designers are developers" at Cursor.</li><li>Content has one destination: the website.</li><li>They ship infrequently enough that git workflows are fine.</li><li>They don't need approval chains, compliance audits, or role-based permissions beyond what GitHub provides.</li><li>Localization is "AI at build time."</li></ul><p>If your company looks like this, maybe markdown in git is fine. Genuinely.</p><p>But most companies don't look like this.</p><p>This is what we are seeing every day:</p><ul><li>Content needs to flow to apps, email systems, AI agents, personalization engines. Not just one website.</li><li>You need structured data, not just prose. Product specs. Pricing tables. Configuration. Things that need to be queryable and validated.</li><li>You have governance requirements. "Who changed this and when" needs actual audit trails, not git blame.</li><li>You need real-time collaboration. Multiple people and agents working on the same content simultaneously. Git merge conflicts on prose are miserable for humans and wasteful for agents.</li><li><!--$?--><template id="B:7"></template>Content operations<!--/$--> need to scale independently of engineering. Not because your team can’t learn git, but because content velocity shouldn’t be bottlenecked by PR review cycles.</li></ul><p>Cursor is ~50 developers shipping one product website. That context matters.</p><p>The debate shouldn't be "CMS vs. no CMS."</p><p>There are definitely parts of the traditional CMS we should nuke into the sun with fire:</p><ul><li>WYSIWYG editors that produce garbage HTML soup</li><li>Page builders that store content as layout blobs (you can't query "all hero sections" if hero sections are just JSON fragments in a page blob)</li><li><!--$?--><template id="B:8"></template>Webhook<!--/$--> hell for basic content updates</li><li>"Content modeling" that's really just "pick from these 15 field types and good luck"</li><li>Revision history that tells you something changed but not what or why</li></ul><p>We can leave these things behind without resorting to git and markdown.</p><p>Rather, the question should be: <strong>is your content infrastructure built for AI to be both author and consumer?</strong></p><p>That means:</p><ul><li><strong>Structured, not flat files.</strong> AI that can reason about typed fields and relationships, not arbitrary strings.</li><li><strong>Queryable, not grep-able.</strong> Real query languages that understand your schema, not regex pattern matching.</li><li><strong>Real-time, not batch.</strong> Content changes shouldn't require a <!--$?--><template id="B:9"></template>deployment<!--/$--> to be visible.</li><li><strong>Presentation-agnostic.</strong> No hex colors in your content model. No assumptions about where content renders. Separation of concerns.</li></ul><p>Lee's frustration was valid: "I don't want to click through UIs just to update content."</p><p>The answer is content infrastructure that works the way modern development does. Agents that understand your schema. Queries that express intent. APIs that don't require you to build a query engine out of grep and find.</p><p>Lee's post went viral because it resonated. Developers have real frustrations with content management tools that were built for a different era.</p><p>We know. We literally built Sanity because we were angry at the CMS industry (a.k.a “spite-driven development”)</p><p>The answer isn't to retreat to 2002 and plain text files for agents to parse. It's to build what actually solves the problem: content infrastructure that AI can read, write, and reason about.</p><p>You shouldn't build a CMS from scratch with grep and markdown files. You probably shouldn't have to click through forms to update content either. Both of these can be true.</p><p>The tools exist to have it both ways. Structured content that agents can actually query. Editorial interfaces that don't require git. Real-time collaboration that doesn't involve merge conflicts on prose.</p><p>That's what we're building. Lee's post is a good reminder of what happens when we don't get it right.</p></div></div>]]></description>

</p><h2><strong>Buffalo Hide Academy</strong></h2>

<p>The school year was almost past, and a hot May afternoon lorded over Browning, Montana, capital of the Blackfeet Nation. Grinning rez dogs with patchy coats rested in the sidewalk shade outside an alternative public high school called Buffalo Hide Academy, where lunch was ending. Students ambled into a warehouse-sized classroom with a podium and some tables at the far end, and musical instruments in a corner by the teacher’s office. Student artwork and a Blackfeet Nation flag bedecked the walls alongside a mural of a buffalo skull and the school’s name in dripping red letters. The kids didn’t sit in rows or take out homework; nobody checked whether they were on time. They shuffled around in grubby Converse, joking with each other at full volume. Some picked up instruments and started jamming with their teacher, Robert Hall (Piikunii), who was already messing around on the drum kit. It got loud, fast.



</p><p>“I would describe Browning as metal,” Hall told me, seated at the drums in a luau shirt and bushy black ponytail, his ferocious brown eyes the size of jawbreakers. “We don’t turn away from the darkness,” he said. “We don’t hide our own ugliness, the way that people in big cities could hide.” The town is rough, even by rez standards. “There’s buildings that have been standing just in a void. No humans, no life running through these buildings for years,” Hall explained. “But there’s immense beauty here, too — extreme beauty. Our murals, our family networks, our ancient history, our language, the things that are binding us together for thousands of generations.”

</p>



<p>Another teacher, Charlie Speicher, warmed up the mic. “Who likes chaotic mathcore?” he tried, referring to a rhythmically unpredictable subgenre of hardcore punk that he describes as “bonkers” and “all over the place.” Two hands went up. One was mine. “That makes three of us,” said Speicher as he pulled up a YouTube video.


</p>
<p>The students were finishing the inaugural year of Buffalo Hide Academy’s semester-long, two-hour heavy music symposium dedicated to the study of metal and hardcore. Speicher, who’s non-Native, is a clinical counselor and also Buffalo Hide Academy’s director. The symposium was his brainchild. He and other teachers hand-picked students who looked like they might be isolated, or might be into darker, more aggressive art and music — kids who might be potential metalheads. More than fifty students initially enrolled. By the end of the first semester, kids were sneaking out of other classes to join.



</p><p>Speicher teaches in his “battle vest,” a staple of metal fashion that’s usually denim hand-studded with metal pyramids or spikes, and stitched with patches showing band logos in barbed, rootlike scripts impossible for the uninitiated to decipher. In addition to providing a feeling of physical protection, battle vests are threshold guardians that intimidate normies while signalling to dedicated fans who recognize the glyphs. If you know, you know — and you’re family. If not, fuck off. But Speicher is here to welcome kids into the fold, where a community of music fans understands their suffering. Or, as he put it later, “to create more safety and protection specifically from suicidal distress,” which he said has impacted every family in Browning.



</p><p>Some in Browning think he’s doing the devil’s work, but Speicher is as warm and approachable as a cool youth pastor, speaking gently and smiling easily through a handsome swath of stubble. His vest is emblazoned with the gaunt face from Converge’s 2001 album <em>Jane Doe.</em> He showed the kids the music video to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY-JkeXK4dU">Farewell, Mona Lisa</a>” by mathcore band The Dillinger Escape Plan. It sometimes sounds like Dick Van Dyke’s fancy footwork flawlessly executing a trip and stumble. “Goes hard, huh? What’d you see? What’d you hear?”



</p><p>It’s precise and complicated, students said. The guitars and drums are in conversation, mirroring each other. The drumming starts like black metal blast beats but switches into a groove. Rough vocals alternate with intelligible singing. Guitars are in standard tuning, not drop-tuning like most metal. The fashion is different from metal too – less theatrical. One student noted the singer’s contorted body language: “He’s feeling his emotions while he’s letting the art out of him.”



</p><p>“Mmm, beautiful,” Speicher said. Later, students looked at landscape photos and guessed which heavy genre or subgenre they represented: a frozen forest for black metal; a crumbling alley for doom; an urban protest for hardcore; an alligator swamp for death metal. They discussed “geographic determinism,” the theory that music is shaped partly by its place of origin.



</p><blockquote>
<p>“But there’s immense beauty here, too — extreme beauty. Our murals, our family networks, our ancient history, our language, the things that are binding us together for thousands of generations.”


</p></blockquote>

<p>But Speicher wasn’t just there to nerd out. He shifted seamlessly into an overview of heavy music’s therapeutic benefits: catharsis, community and coping skills. “Heavy music teaches us things such as we’re not alone; when life is dark, we do something about it. We’re not just a prisoner to that darkness. But also that our risk fluctuates, that our misery isn’t gonna last forever. There are ways through it.” Students doodled in notebooks, idly plucked at an unplugged bass guitar, or held hands under the table.&nbsp;



</p><p>A history lesson from another teacher on the ’80s and ’90s Scandinavian origins of black metal — including its problematic elements, like murder and Nazism among some bands — served as a caution to consume media critically. While hardcore is overtly political and tends hard left, the morality of metal is murkier, oriented primarily around pushing extremes and attacking social norms. Results can be chaotic. This segued into a high-level, student-led conversation about whether and when to separate art from artist. In another lesson, Speicher said, they’d studied the Vietnam War through the lens of Black Sabbath, whose 1970 staple “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ssFjyDIyQ0">War Pigs</a>” critiqued American involvement.

</p>



<p>“Your homework tonight, and I’ll remind you of this later, go listen to the song ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiKjcrniJKY">43% Burnt</a>.’” Speicher told students to pay special attention to an influential breakdown at the end. They broke off to paint each other’s faces in “corpse paint,” and take album cover-style photos with animal skulls and hides. Emily Edwards (Piikunii), an almost-15-year-old, schooled me on Swedish rock. “You don’t know Ghost?” she said. Inspired by the class, Edwards and some friends had started their own band, Crimson Harmony. Edwards was one of many students who signed up for a paid internship at an upcoming metal festival called Fire in the Mountains coming to Blackfeet Nation later that summer. Festival internships were part of why teachers started the symposium.&nbsp;



</p><p>Nicholas Rink (Piikunii), who teaches Blackfeet studies and language, pulled me aside, brimming with excitement. He was painting the skull of a buffalo the students helped process. Across its brow he’d painted overlapping bear paws, mother and cub, in flame colors. He dotted them with pinprick white stars — Ursa Major and Minor, which he said both Piikunii and European traditions recognize as bears. The skull was a gift for Norwegian festival headliners Wardruna, whose latest album, <em>Birna</em>, was named in honor of the bear. Rink had aligned the painted stars to match the position the real stars would take when Wardruna performed beneath them in Blackfeet Nation.

<h2><strong>The Firekeepers</strong></h2>

<p><strong>AS COVID ARRIVED IN 2020, </strong>a string of suicides ripped through the Blackfeet Nation, claiming multiple kids per year, some as young as 11. Speicher said it hit the entire community “like a sledgehammer.” He called up a fourth grade teacher in Rathdrum, Idaho, named Steve Von Till, whom metalheads might recognize as a doomy poet-troubadour and the former Neurosis guitarist. Speicher, Hall, Rink, Von Till and a few others banded together to help their students stay alive, as if building a protective fire to shelter them in the darkness. They called themselves the <a href="http://firekeeperalliance.org/">Firekeeper Alliance</a>.



</p><p>A few years earlier, the crunchy-pagan festival Fire in the Mountains was priced out of gentrifying Jackson, Wyoming. Speicher spoke to its owners about bringing the festival to the rez. He planned to build internships into his class to connect kids with career pathways in an industry of like-minded people. It sounded perfect. But first they needed buy-in from tribal council.



</p><p>The Blackfeet Tribal Business Council has long supported youth through athletics, especially running and basketball. Dipping into the arts, specifically music — to say nothing of metal — would be new territory. But Councilman Everett Armstrong told me that because it was for the kids, they considered it. “Let’s try to go a different route to give our youth something that they can open our minds to, open our hearts to, find themselves,” he said.



</p><p>It could help the nation economically, too, Armstrong said. The reservation lies along the imaginary line splitting Piikunii homelands into the colonial annex called Glacier National Park. The park is an <a href="https://www.nps.gov/glac/learn/news/tourism-to-glacier-national-park-contributes-548m-to-local-economy.htm">over-half-billion-dollar industry</a>. But many Piikunii people, Armstrong said, live in poverty. It’s one of the factors contributing to the widespread suicidal distress that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/data.html">disproportionately harms Native communities</a>. When I told folks I was going to Blackfeet Nation, most didn’t know where that was, until I mentioned Glacier. The monied Glacier Park Lodge had a gift shop peddling Glacier mementos — but, despite being on the reservation, offered nothing I could take home that says “Blackfeet Nation.” “We need to try to tap into that and try to get some revenue back into the Blackfeet Reservation,” Armstrong said.&nbsp;



</p><p>For the festival to work, they needed bands big enough to draw fans to the rez. So in August 2024, the Firekeepers flew to Boulder, Colorado, to court pagan folk band Wardruna, whose world tour was starting at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Speicher and the gang wanted to meet in person and convince them to play Blackfeet Nation. It’s for the children, they would say. Norwegian and Piikunii cultures share traditions of animism. The Firekeepers brought sweet pine ties, used for smudging, as gifts, and met Wardruna at the C.U. Boulder library. They didn’t know the band was already sold on the idea. Singer Einar Selvik had spoken to Speicher on the phone, and they were ready to say yes.



</p><p>“A chance to stand with (the) Indigenous in a constructive, powerful way, and a chance to visit a beautiful place and to do something that is more than just a festival, more than just a concert,” Selvik told me, “all the pieces just fit so well together.” It was a major get for the festival. Rink said they stayed up all night talking about it. Their vision and the Nordic stars had aligned.&nbsp;

<h2><strong>Dance Intertribal</strong></h2>

<p><strong>LATE JULY: AMTRAK UNLOADED A GAGGLE OF BLACK DENIM</strong> and bandanna-clad metalheads onto the small, sunny platform at East Glacier Park, Montana, a tiny seasonal town 15 minutes outside Browning. Two days earlier, Ozzy Osbourne, the grandfather of metal and lead singer of Black Sabbath, had died.

</p>



<p>Because it was the festival’s first time on a reservation, nobody knew what to expect. Festivals, after all, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/feb/27/fyre-festival-2-mexico">can go very badly</a>, and no one wanted to remember this as “Fyre” in the Mountains. But good omens greeted us. Our Lord and Savior Ozzy must have parted the week’s rainy spell for a few days of perfect festival weather: high 70s, partly cloudy, cool after sunset.&nbsp;



</p><p>The Firekeeper Alliance distributed tickets to the local community, and invited Blackfoot attendees from Canada. Others road tripped in, or flew into Kalispell, around 2,400 fans — a third of them Natives, Speicher and Rink estimated — converging from across the continent for three days and 23 bands.



</p><p>On the festival grounds, the party opened not with a land acknowledgement but a welcome from the land’s actual Indigenous people. In proper Native fashion, they held a grand entry, and true to form, it started late. “We’re runnin’ on Indian time!”&nbsp; shouted Hall through a megaphone, war-whooping and half-dangling from the back of a motorcycle that Speicher peeled across the rugged ground.



</p><p>As the crew finished setting up a stage in the distance, hundreds of metalheads sat watching in a circle while Piikunii locals in regalia danced fancy, traditional, chicken, jingle and grass. Young Grey Horse hammered the drum and Hall let his rowdy demeanor emcee, throwing out Charlie Hill jokes to keep the mood light. For many, it was a transformative moment. Some fans had never been to a powwow and were encountering Indigenous culture for the first time.



</p><p>Finally, Hall called for an intertribal — an all-inclusive dance. The metalheads hesitated, but after a few courageous outliers broke onto the grass, others followed, bouncing a circle in their battle vests and black jeans, like a respectful, slow-motion mosh pit, as they awkwardly tried to two-step like the pros. A showboating school-aged fancy dancer twirled past them in her shawl, rapid-fire footwork leaving them in the dust. But the dance was a welcome, not a competition. Hearts were opening. People cheered, Natives and non-Natives together.



</p><p>For Selvik, the powwow was a powerful way “to set the tone, to open the circle.” This festival required some vulnerability of attendees, some deference. We were guests on Piikunii lands. There would be no alcohol — a marked adjustment for metal culture. It would be, as Hall declared, “a cultural exchange between the Piikunii and metalheads.”



</p><h2><strong>Fringe Culture</strong></h2>

<p><strong>“ON MY RESERVATION, PEOPLE ONLY LISTEN TO TWO THINGS:</strong> rap or hip-hop,” joked Logan Mason (Colville), who traveled from Spokane and volunteered with the camping crew in exchange for festival admission. Mason lost his brother and nephew to suicide, and metal helped him work through depression in his late teens and early 20s. “Growing up, I did not know anybody else that listened to black metal or death metal.”&nbsp;



</p><p>On other reservations, it’s different. The Navajo Nation, for example, has a genre-defining “<a href="https://www.hcn.org/articles/photos-heavy-metal-music-in-the-navajo-nation-award/">rez metal</a>” scene. Some folks joke that you’re either a hip-hop Native or a metal Native. If anything, Natives seem over-represented in the metal community. “A lot of it is land-based,” said Meg Skyum (Oji-Cree), who’d come to the festival from Ontario to see the Native black metal outfit Blackbraid and get a sneak preview of their third album. Atmospheric black metal in particular is “about the fucking trees and shit,” which Natives appreciate. Plus, Natives and metalheads, Skyum added, both live in the margins of ordinary society. “We’re fringe, they’re fringe.”



</p><blockquote>
<p>“A chance to stand with (the) Indigenous in a constructive, powerful way, and a chance to visit a beautiful place and to do something that is more than just a festival, more than just a concert.”


</p></blockquote>

<p>“The metal tribe itself seems to attract a lot of people that go through different types of struggle,” said Tomas Falomir (Ojibwe, Hopi and Zuni Pueblo descent) from Parker, Colorado, noting that the music is healing, the community welcoming. “Any type of person could be included.”



</p><p>There’s also something about the sound, Falomir added. “It almost goes with the loudness, and even down to the beat of it.” Other fans agreed. The thundering drums and powerful vocals resemble a modernized version of Native music, one said. Pomona-based Indigenous death/doom project Tzompantli would later exemplify this, shaking the festival grounds with stomping downtempos from a battalion of traditional and contemporary drums. And European bands like Wardruna, fans noted, are really, <em>really</em> into their cultures, especially pre-Christian traditions, just like Natives.



</p><p>“A lot of people are into metal because of how much trauma that we go through in our daily lives. And not only in our own daily lives, but our historical trauma,” said Damien Jones Jr. (Diné), who traveled with family from Lukachukai in Navajo Nation, and brought one of the festival’s most-photographed battle vests, decked out with turquoise geometrics and a “Frybread Power” backpatch<em>.</em> Jones plays saxophone — classical and jazz. “That’s what I do as well, throw all my feelings and emotions into music.”

<h2><strong>Dark Horse, Ride</strong></h2>

<p><strong>“WELCOME TO THE BACKBONE OF THE WORLD,” </strong>read the sign at Red Eagle Campground, where the Rockies arched like the knobby vertebrae of a sleeping Elder God half-buried in sediment. Across glassy Two Medicine Lake an amphitheater of pines presided like a chorus between the water line and a low timberline. On the near bank, a footpath wound along the edge of the lake, opening to beach access here and there with pop-up canopies and scatterings of hay-bale seats for workshops and panels on Indigenous sovereignty, ethnobotany, the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous people, and the therapeutic effects of heavy music.



</p><p>A cluster of interconnected meadows transformed into parking lots, a village of glamping yurts, a small bazaar of vendor tents, and the “stage bowl”: a shallow glen with two stages set up between tipis serving as green rooms. Curtains of savory smoke stoked saliva as Montana “off-grid catering” team <a href="https://www.regionsauvage.com/">Region Sauvage</a> barbecued ducks and student-processed buffalo. High school interns decorated the stages with skulls, antlers, driftwood, witchy-Indigenous pieces of the forest. Edwards worked the merch tent, hawking Firekeeper Alliance shirts that showed a malevolent spirit of suicide haunting a tipi where Native kids sheltered around a fire. Proceeds supported suicide prevention. Shirts sold out the first day. Parking attendants and security all seemed suspiciously chill. It was intentional, they explained. Natives are used to being followed and scrutinized. Nobody wanted that atmosphere here.



</p><p>First on stage was Sage Bond (Diné and Nde), an up-and-coming acoustic metal singer-songwriter from Tonalea in Navajo Nation, who’d previously toured in support of suicide prevention efforts on her reservation. Bond matched the mountain sunshine with a low snarl a la Eddie Vedder, before breaking into a roar the size of 10 mountain lions — what she called “the Cookie Monster vocals.” Bond expected a sparse crowd drifting in and out, but her performance captivated hundreds. It was a big moment — her first time playing a festival that size, which she jokingly called a “black metal Coachella” (though the only feather headdresses were on tribal council members). “How the heck did they even find me?”



</p><p>Turns out Bond was recommended by Chicago black metal artists Pan-Amerikan Native Front. During their set, they invited students onstage to headbang alongside the singer, Kurator of War, in black-and-white face paint and crossed bullet sashes. Other students held up a Blackfeet Nation flag&nbsp; and tossed their long hair next to barrel-chested guitarist Necroboar (Purépecha), who looked mean as hell in spiked leather cuffs, but later, backstage, was beaming. “A lot of people are thanking us for being here with the kids,” Necroboar said, “but it’s like you don’t understand what this means to us to be here and to see them.” He told me he and his bandmates saw themselves in the teenagers. Misty-eyed fans agreed, knowing they would remember this moment forever. The band had rehearsed their set that morning at Buffalo Hide Academy with the kids. They’d always wanted to play a rez. Being here was a dream come true. “I’m still shaking from it,” Necroboar said.

<p>Musicians didn’t quarantine themselves. Many hung out with fans — riding horses, paddleboarding, doing yoga by the lake, attending workshops and panel discussions, or headbanging in the crowds. By the food stands selling frybread with huckleberry butter, metalheads set up a little table as an altar to Ozzy. It gathered river rocks, feathers, cigarettes, and trinkets. “Long Live the Prince of Darkness,” read a sign at the feet of a grinning Ozzy bobblehead and some candles.



</p><p>Twenty-four weeks pregnant, Heather Jordan (Diné) delivered a scorching set in the sunshine with her masked drummer pummeling the kit behind her. Jordan is the singer and guitarist for Navajo Nation blackened doomgaze duo Liłith. She’d wanted to play Fire in the Mountains because favorites like Wolves in the Throne Room preceded her. And it helped that this year’s festival focused on “the Native side of things.” Jordan works a day job at a restaurant serving tourists on her own rez, which is also dry. “It’s like the hardest thing for them to understand,” she said. When Fire in the Mountains invited Liłith, their answer was “Hell, yes.”



</p><p>The festival’s spirituality attracted Jon Krieger of Blackbraid, a solo recording project that blew up overnight when his first single, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buh0h-8zrP4">Barefoot Ghost Dance on Blood Soaked Soil</a>,” got traction on YouTube in 2022. “All the black metal that’s the best in the world in my opinion comes from the heart,” Krieger said. Blackbraid was one of around five Native bands playing the festival, though Krieger, who was adopted, doesn’t know his tribal affiliation. Black metal is a spiritual genre, he said, and while it’s dominated by “Scandinavian dudes talking about old Norse religion and culture,” the values align. “Anti-Christianity is something that we share with them.”



</p><blockquote>
<p>“A lot of people are into metal because of how much trauma that we go through in our daily lives. And not only in our own daily lives, but our historical trauma.”


</p></blockquote>

<p>On stage later, beneath an array of a dozen stag skulls, Krieger was slinking around like a ghostly Indigenous Jim Morrison, windmilling his waist-length hair, blasting life force through a cedar flute and leaning over the crowd to shriek upward-arcing shards — whose strength never flagged during his entire blistering set — as his guitarist crowned his howls with constellations of tremolo picking. In the mosh pit, one fan hoisted a buffalo rib the size of a baseball bat, presumably from the barbecue, like some feral invocation. Blackbraid’s performance may have converted Daniels, the photographer, to solid metal fandom. But after Converge, he stood by me and said, “Now I get it.”



</p><p>Converge was another get, one of Speicher’s favorites. Bassist Nate Newton had Zoomed into Speicher’s classroom to chat music with students. So had Ivar Bjørnson from Enslaved — A-listers, donating their time to Browning rez kids.



</p><p>Before Converge played, Speicher and the other Firekeepers presented them with a buffalo skull painted with the iconic <em>Jane Doe</em> face. And they gifted the buffalo’s tongue, the most prized part of the animal, to tribal council.



</p><p>A mosh pit opened in the center of the crowd as soon as Converge blasted forth, the biggest and most fearsome pit yet. The chaos of bodies in conflict summoned a dust devil from the Earth into the sky. It might not look like it, but there’s a shared ethic at work, what Hall called “consensual fucking violence, man.” If you get a bloody nose, you can be proud. If you fall, fans pick you back up. We aren’t fighting. By bracing and colliding, we’re helping each other. The rush is purifying. The release, stabilizing. Jumping in, you might want to die, but when the pit spits you out, you’ll be beaming like Necroboar — happy to have survived the maelstrom.



</p><div><p>Partway through Converge’s set, skinny, sleeve-tatted frontman Jacob Bannon passed the mic to a Piikunii youth, who seamlessly took over the chorus of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV4x5DsES9w">Dark Horse</a>.”</p><p><em>We’ll show the demons<br>For what they are<br>Dark!<br>Horse!<br>Ride!<br>Towards the light!</em></p></div><figure><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2000" height="1335" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=2000%2C1335&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 2500w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=2000%2C1335&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=1536%2C1025&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=2048%2C1367&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=780%2C521&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=400%2C267&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?w=370&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"><figcaption>The mosh pit during Converge’s performance. <span><span>Credit:</span> <a href="https://www.russeldaniels.com/">Russel Albert Daniels / High Country News</a></span></figcaption></figure>

<p>He knew every shout and scream by heart, absolutely commanding the stage. The crowd was living for it.



</p><p>Musicians understood the assignment and turned it up to 11, new blood and seasoned pros alike. As dusk settled, staff closed the lakeside trails, mindful of everyone’s safety, while Finnish folk metal band Hexvessel sang about people disappearing into the forests. After dark, fans gathered around a bonfire to ward off the chill. Wardruna took the stage and spread their haunting ambience to the woods’ inky edges. Someone dressed like a wizard slipped through the crowds as a human figure with antlers danced silhouetted before a glowing tipi. High above a membrane of diffuse gray, the bear stars slowly turned.



</p><p><strong>A Strange Road to Joy</strong>



</p><p><strong>A FULL MAP OF METAL’S SPRAWLING SUBGENRES</strong> is hard to pin down. But for what it’s worth, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Musical_subgenres_by_genre">Wikipedia lists 34 subgenres and 16 sub-subgenres</a> of metal, rivalled primarily by much broader genres like pop, rock, and opera, the latter which has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_opera_genres">120</a> subgenres. <em>Encyclopaedia Metallum</em> lists <a href="https://www.metal-archives.com/browse/genre">16 main subgenres</a>, but sub-subgenres and combinations seem unlimited.



</p><p>Like opera, much of metal prioritizes the voice — though as an aesthetic inversion. Similar to Inuit throat singing, vocalizations are guttural and challenging to master. Like wine, metal adheres to a pedigree whose sense experience reflects a place of origin: Cascadian black metal, for instance, is hazy as the misty forests of the Pacific Northwest. And like European classical music, or jazz, metal ranges in style from ambient drone to bombastic spectacle to precise and unpredictable arrangements astonishing to perform.



</p><blockquote>
<p>“We’ve all&nbsp;had periods&nbsp;of hurt. And this music was the medicine we didn’t know we needed until we’re in it.”


</p></blockquote>

<p>But something deeper draws metalheads together, perhaps a willingness to inquire on levels the establishment forbids. What most clearly sets it apart from other genres is that it’s so rooted in anger and sadness — or their common ancestors: terror, lack, isolation and despair. Metal, one fan told me, is “a strange road to joy.”



</p><p>“We’ve all had periods of hurt,” Kurator of War said, seated on a folding chair next to Von Till with singer-songwriter Chelsea Wolfe, Newton and Bjørnson. No makeup, no bullets. Behind them, morning clouds rippled like flags on the glacier-crisp pebble beds of Two Medicine Lake. “And this music was the medicine we didn’t know we needed until we’re in it.” A crowd of metalheads sat cross-legged on the grass, or perched on hay bales in the partial pine shade, listening to the panel. “I think we’re all curious. I think we’re all empathetic. I think we want to get to that other side of connection and knowledge.”

<p>Speicher lobbed questions that prompted an intimate conversation about the healing power of heavy music, which at times drew tears — from fans and musicians. Von Till said heavy music is a way of “getting rid of the sickness,” which helps him become more sensitive and vulnerable. He also noted the importance of catharsis. “How many times has that moment of release prevented that one moment in a kid that can’t be retaken?”



</p><p>Early in Bjørnson’s life, he realized people had to be athletic or good looking for acceptance in some groups. “With the metal gang, the qualification was being into metal,” he said.



</p><p>“It’s not like this kind of stuff attracts normal people. Like we all — you’re weird. You’re all weird,” Newton said to ripples of laughter and cheers. “And it’s beautiful. We could be completely different but we have this one thing that we both understand: why we’re into it.”



</p><p>“It’s them that are weird,” Von Till parried. “We’re the normal ones, right? Fuck that.” More cheers.



</p><p><strong>Oh, Lord, Yeah</strong>



</p><p><strong>ON THE THIRD DAY, THE SKY RENT IN TWO.</strong> Just as the evening drained of color, the power went out — halfway through a set by Virginia headbangers Inter Arma. They didn’t stop. Only the drum kit was audible without amps and mics, but the drummer kept spirits rolling as the minutes wore on, stage hands scrambling to patch the glitch.

<p>Sparse raindrops descended upon the crowd, but nobody seemed to care. Then the familiar tick of a tempo rose from the drummer’s high hat cymbals. The crowd started laughing, cheering, singing. It was “War Pigs” — Sabbath. Colorful stage lights fired back up. When the metalheads sang “Oh, Lord, yeah!” the sneer of Ozzy’s voice carried like mist across the many, a phantom formed by hundreds of mouths in unison. Re-amped guitars picked up the lick to complete the collective homage. Piikunii highschoolers sieged the stage again, drumming powwow style alongside the band.



</p><p>Nigh had the crowd caught its breath when lightning flashed like a Catholic schoolteacher flicking the lights. Thunder murmured from the belly of the Rockies beyond a ridgeline that blurred into rolling gray. Another flash. Closer, noted Daniels, the photographer; maybe two second’s delay. Sparse droplets swelled to a downpour. The lightless heavens opened, the Prince of Darkness summoned.



</p><p>“This is metal,” a festival staff member in a Day-Glo vest shouted to fans gathered under the merch tent. He wasn’t speaking metaphorically. The tent’s frame could draw lightning. “Shelter in your cars or tents!” he ordered. “Go, now! <em>Now!”</em> Metalheads scrambled for cover, evacuating in slick mud.



</p><p>Daniels and I found ourselves with some new friends, ducking into the yurt of one of the musicians, Rebecca Vernon, founder of Salt Lake City doom-sludge band SubRosa, who now performs a solo piano project called The Keening. She invited us in, offered us snacks, made sure we were all safe and hydrated. We laughed together, Natives and non-Natives, prisoners of the darkness, speculating about whether Inter Arma had summoned the spirit of Grandfather Ozzy and he was messing with us from — wherever he was. We worried the next set might be canceled. It was one of the headliners, Old Man’s Child, a fan favorite that helped define the Norwegian black metal sound in the early days. In over 30 years, Old Man’s Child had never played in the United States. But they’d agreed to play Blackfeet Nation.



</p><p>“Debuting in a setting like this adds depth to the moment,” singer Galder <a href="https://knotfest.com/blogs/from-the-artist/galder-discusses-old-man-s-child-s-homecoming-and-american-debut-at-fire-in-the-mountains">told the website <em>Knotfest</em></a> before the festival. “There’s something about the rawness and unpredictability of the natural world that mirrors what I try to capture in Old Man’s Child. The beauty in the darkness, the stillness before the storm, the feeling of something ancient just beneath the surface.” That ancient unpredictability may have just gotten the better of his grand North American debut.

<p>A scream rang through the night. Or a shout? It was hard to understand, like metal vocals. I unzipped the door flap. The rain had stopped. The shouts rang clearer a second time: “Show’s back on!” We jammed our feet back into soggy shoes and boots.



</p><p>It was fully nighttime when the storm’s misery passed. A string of fans with phone flashlights and headlamps meandered back down the muddy path and over a little footbridge, across a babbling brook to the clearing where the bonfire flared bright and warm between the stages, belching embers upward like some inverted underworld rain. From a distance, the returning metalheads looked like a serpent of stars.



</p><p>By firelight we danced with a Piikunii grandmother in a silk bandanna to Dio’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrBUjXaRSUQ">Rainbow in the Dark</a>,” euphoria setting in from the topsy-turvy snafu and the might of nature, which had banished all traces of late-festival fatigue. Then finally, riding in on the heels of the thunderstorm, Old Man’s Child took the stage. Galder, in corpse paint, dispatched legions of fog wraiths, strobe spectres galloping across a sea of electrified faces. A beautiful hell broke loose, exorcising our collective and personal demons. The festival — the ceremony — was complete.



</p><p><strong>‘Our ancestors held ceremony together’</strong>



</p><p><strong>ON SOCIAL MEDIA, FANS WERE STUPID WITH ENTHUSIASM </strong>about the weekend: <em>“Pure magic,”</em> <em>“transformational,”</em> <em>“profound,</em>”<em> “life changing.” </em>They posted reports of unexpected tears and healing. One Instagram comment called it the “the most incredible metal festival I’ve been to, and it was my 3rd one this summer.” Others called it the best music festival they’d been to of any genre. Daniels, newly baptized, joined the chorus: “<em>I have joined the cvlt.”</em>



</p><p>And it wasn’t just the music. The consensus seemed to be that the lack of alcohol actually enhanced the experience. Frank Godla, co-founder of digital publication <em>Metal Injection</em>, said he learned <a href="https://metalinjection.net/show-recap/fire-in-the-mountains-2025-rewrote-the-script-of-what-a-heavy-metal-fest-could-should-be">more about Native people at this festival</a> than he ever had from books or documentaries. Wardruna echoed the many in posting humble thanks to the Blackfeet Nation: “There are so many people out there in the world who deeply sympathize and stand with you and your ancestors in all your struggles. I am one of those people,” Salnik captioned a picture of himself on stage, proudly holding aloft the hand-painted buffalo skull. “It was like our ancestors held ceremony together and their meeting is rippling as we speak.”



</p><p>And the learning was two-way: Tribal Chairman Rodney “Minnow” Gervais took the stage to remark on how kind and diverse the metalheads were, how clean they kept the grounds. “Be proud of yourselves,” he said. “What you see here is proof that music transcends religion, color, whatever you want. It brings us all together.”



</p><p>“They look scary,” Councilman Armstrong told me about the metalheads, “but they’re some of the nicest people. They’re so welcoming.” People I spoke to in East Glacier agreed. Armstrong said tribal council is now considering branching into music events of other genres, too.



</p><p>“It’s heartwarming to have a full circle moment for me,” Mason, the fan from Spokane, said, seeing Native culture come together with the music he loves, in support of a cause close to his heart. “I was like damn, was this festival calling me?” After interning at the merch tent, Edwards said she might pick a different long-term job, but does see herself working in the music industry. And she wants to keep playing in a band when she is older, Crimson Harmony or otherwise.



</p><p>As stray metalheads sat around the grand foyer of Glacier Park Lodge, leaning on their backpacks or napping on the sofas, waiting for the evening train, a classical guitarist plucked out a polished-up version of the Led Zeppelin classic “Stairway to Heaven.” On the train back to the West Coast, the metalheads hung out as new friends. In the observation car, they shared weekend highlights, Natives and non-Natives together.



</p><p>A week later, I saw Von Till and Vernon again, this time in Portland, the last stop on Von Till’s summer tour before the new school year. We were still thinking about the festival. We tried to pin down what it was about Fire in the Mountains that still had us sobbing intermittently a week out. Von Till nailed it: “It made me dare to hope.”

<p><strong>Can You Imagine</strong>



</p><p><em>“If there’s a world where we don’t have to worry about suicide, that’s a world where we don’t have to worry about bullying, that’s a world where we don’t have to worry about violence, about war.”</em>



</p><p><em>“I feel like that world wouldn’t work.”</em>



</p><p><em>“You could try to picture it, but it never really fully comes into view.”</em>


</p>
<p><em>“I feel like it needs to be talked about.”</em>



</p><p><em>“I like to daydream about that a lot.”&nbsp;</em>



</p><p><em>“These are things I think about too much and I don’t have too many spaces to set them out of my mind.”</em>



</p><p><em>“There’d probably be a lot more people at the reservations, and more family and connection.”</em>



</p><p><em>“Those little subtle moments that we all share, of sitting next to the fireplace, or sharing a new book, making a new friend, all of that would still keep expanding in mysterious ways of goodness.”</em>



</p><p><em>“Everyone just being creative.”</em>



</p><p><em>“It looks probably a little bit like heaven.”</em> &nbsp;
