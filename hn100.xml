<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-content">
                            <p>One of Karl Marx’s most penetrating insights was that a network of mechanisms embedded in the logic of capitalism not only fuel the system’s transformative dynamism but also undermine its cohesion. These internal contradictions operate across every dimension of the socioeconomic landscape, including its ideological characteristics and political institutions. In their relentless pursuit of profits, capitalist enterprises constantly strive to reduce their labor costs through wage suppression and mechanization. But reductions in the buying power of workers erode the primary source of demand for the products those enterprises must sell in order to realize profits.</p>
<p>Capitalism gave rise to a value system that teaches us to find meaning in our work; yet millions are employed in low-paying, soul-crushing jobs. And while modern capitalism promises — and is indeed fully capable of providing — broad-based prosperity, the system, via the state, routinely promotes and enforces austerity policies aimed at compelling people to work harder for lower pay and less job security. Output per worker increases year by year because of improvements in technology, but the austerity evangelists insist that if we want capitalism to continue to bestow its blessings on humanity, workers must accept lower living standards and the social safety net needs to be dismantled.</p>
<p>In <em><a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo181707138.html">The Capital Order</a></em>, Clara Mattei brings to light the fascinating story of how austerity became a crucial weapon of class warfare. In this major contribution to the political and intellectual history of modern capitalism, Mattei traces the roots of neoliberalism to the political reaction against the militant working-class movements that emerged in Europe after World War I.</p>
<p>Modern warfare requires the mobilization of labor and capital on an enormous scale. During the Great War, national governments took control of their economies to ensure that the material requirements of the war would be met. Wages, work hours, and prices were regulated; production targets were imposed on manufacturers; strikes were criminalized, and shirking was penalized by conscription and deployment to the front; private property was requisitioned; key industries were nationalized. The aim of these policies was to ensure maximum production for the war effort without triggering a disruptive backlash from either the working class or the owners of capital.</p>
<p>But these massive wartime interventions exposed an inconvenient fact. Economic forces never operate independently of society’s political dynamics. If the state could mold the economy to serve the needs of war, in peacetime it could mold it to promote the well-being of those whose sweat, muscles, and brains are the basis of national prosperity. The war had demonstrated “the profoundly political nature of the capitalist economy.” When the war ended, workers, who had toiled and bled for their country, wanted a fairer share of the income their labor was generating; they wanted the right to unionize; and they wanted better working conditions, decent housing, and an effective social safety net.</p>
<p>In Britain and Italy, workers were organized, had suffrage rights, and, by 1919, were making demands on employers and the state for a revision of the social contract. This threat to the prerogatives of capital, Mattei argues, provoked a reaction in the form of a comprehensive set of state-imposed austerity policies aimed at pounding the working class into a state of docility. In addition to repelling the existential menace of working-class militancy, these policies would establish lasting mechanisms for channeling income and wealth upward from workers to capitalists.</p>
<p>Mattei describes these developments splendidly in the early chapters of her book. She has done an impressive amount of archival research and has skillfully mined the published literature of the interwar period. The fruit of these labors is a rich and insightful account of a pivotal moment in capitalism’s history.</p>
<p>She calls our attention to a pair of international conferences that were convened shortly after the end of the Great War to discuss the financial and economic challenges that confronted the combatant European nations. The League of Nations sponsored a conference in Brussels in 1920; another conference took place in Genoa in 1922 under the auspices of the Supreme Council of the Allies. Historians have generally regarded these conferences as failures because the participating delegates were unable to arrive at a concrete agreement for managing the problems posed by war debt and globally disordered balance of payments accounts. Mattei argues instead that the two conferences established the framework of the austerity agenda adopted throughout the capitalist world in subsequent decades: “The two conferences reunited the European establishment under the flag of technocracy to construct and implement austerity. Technocrats were rising as the new protectors of capitalism — and their sermon was heard loud and clear across the continent.”</p>
<p>The austerity gospel held that economic growth was driven not by the productive activity and spending of workers but by the virtuous abstinence of capitalists, whose savings were transformed into capital accumulation by the invisible hand of the market. National prosperity therefore required the redistribution of income away from workers and toward capitalists. Workers’ demands for higher wages and fewer hours had to be resisted. Public spending on health care, education, and social services had to be sharply curtailed because it drew financial resources away from capital accumulation. Government budgets needed to be balanced, and monetary policy needed to be tightened. The rhetoric adopted to support this agenda was at times alarmist; one of the documents issued by the Brussels conference contains this dire warning: “Any country which does not contrive as soon as possible to attain the execution of these principles is doomed beyond hope of recovery.”</p>
<p>Mattei identifies three kinds of austerity policies: fiscal austerity, monetary austerity, and industrial austerity — the “austerity trinity.” Fiscal austerity involves reducing government spending, particularly on programs aimed at providing social services and income support to working-class people; regressive taxation, aimed at buttressing the after-tax incomes of the propertied classes, is also part of the fiscal austerity mix. Monetary austerity entails restricting access to liquidity and credit when labor markets get tight and wages start to rise. Instead of letting the market adjust the price of labor in response to worker-friendly market conditions, the austerity credo requires that workers get knocked back into line by a state-generated recession.</p>
<p>Fiscal discipline and monetary restraint are what normally come to mind when we think of austerity. But Mattei reminds us that industrial austerity is an important part of the arsenal of the capitalist state. Industrial austerity is the weakening or abolition of laws and institutions that protect the interests of workers: right-to-work laws, lax enforcement of fair hiring rules, legislative impediments to the formation of labor unions, tolerance of noncompete clauses in labor contracts, and so forth. Cuts to unemployment benefits weaken the bargaining position of unemployed people relative to employers by reducing the amount of time an unemployed person can take to find a good job; such cuts would fall under the headings of both fiscal and industrial austerity. In the jargon of modern economics, industrial austerity is often characterized as enhancing “labor market flexibility.” A major aim of all austerity regimes is to break the back of organized labor, to neuter it and render it incapable of protecting workers.</p>
<p>A substantial portion of the book is devoted to detailed examinations of how austerity was implemented in Britain and Italy. Mattei shows that in both countries the enforcement of austerity was achieved by removing economic policymaking from democratic control. But the precise method by which democracy was sabotaged differed. In Britain, responsibility for economic decision-making was transferred to the Treasury and the Bank of England, institutions that were insulated from electoral accountability. The two institutions coordinated their activity closely to advance the austerity agenda.</p>
<p>In Italy, the Fascist government that came to power in 1922 imposed austerity largely by decree, and eliminated resistance through electoral fraud, disenfranchisement of the electorate, the imprisonment of political opponents, the suppression of press freedoms, and physical brutality — including political assassinations. Mattei’s point is that, notwithstanding their radical differences in approach, both countries relied upon antidemocratic strategies to execute their austerity agendas in the interwar period. She paints a vivid picture of the policies that were implemented and of the human wreckage they caused.</p>
<p>Mattei has unearthed a great deal of disturbing evidence regarding the state of mind of the advocates of austerity during the interwar period. One of the key players, the Italian economist Maffeo Pantaleoni, denounced workers as “violent, dishonest, and blackmailers of government” (in Mattei’s words) for threatening to strike; he contended that “wages were much higher than [workers’] marginal productivity”; and he endorsed the violent suppression of dissent, including the execution of communist leaders. The casualness with which British monetary economist Ralph G. Hawtrey and Treasury officials Basil Blackett and Otto Niemeyer — the three main architects of Britain’s austerity regime — discussed the suffering that austerity would inflict on working people is shocking in its callousness.</p>
<p>The Italian liberal economist and statesman Luigi Einaudi was never a Fascist and never held any position in a Fascist government; he was opposed to the political authoritarianism of Mussolini’s regime. But he was supportive of the austerity policies that the regime imposed, and he was willing to make his peace with authoritarianism for the sake of what he believed to be sound economic policy. British commentators expressed perfunctory disapproval of Mussolini’s brutality, but for the most part they were prepared to tolerate it as long as he put Italy’s economic affairs in order.</p>
<p>Austerity removes economic policymaking from democratic control and places it in the hands of technocrats or experts. A recurring theme in <em>The Capital Order</em> is the pernicious role of technocrats in the austerity project. “Austerity,” Mattei writes, “found its primary ally in technocracy — a belief in the power of economists as guardians of an indisputable science.” (She is, for example, highly critical of central bank independence, a principle that originated in Britain’s austerity initiative of the 1920s.) Her wariness appears to owe something to the liberatory philosophy of Antonio Gramsci, whose <em>Ordine Nuovo</em> movement</p>
<blockquote><p>stood fast on the idea that any approach to knowledge was inherently, deeply political, since the lens through which one looks at the world may foreclose or open spaces for imagination and thus establish if and what alternatives . . . are viable. While the predominant lens to interpret the world foreclosed imagination and nurtured acceptance of the capitalist order, the emancipatory lens opened up possibilities to envisage a different society.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mattei’s discussion of Gramsci and his circle is one of the highlights of the book. From a Gramscian perspective, technocrats and experts enforce a top-down conception of knowledge that, Mattei contends, inevitably serves the interests of the prevailing power structure.</p>
<p>There is no doubt a good deal of truth in this. Expertise is, in a certain sense, a bourgeois concept, a by-product of the ideological imperative to organize our lives and activities in a rational way. But it is difficult to see how any complex industrial society, including a socialist society, could do without technocrats. Think of the multitude of issues that the modern state must address: housing policy, trash removal, public health and sanitation, education, policing, the administration of justice, national defense, public transportation, airline safety, disaster relief. The list is endless. None of these issues can be managed effectively without experts who have reasonable latitude to exercise their judgment in the service of the common good. Admittedly, the common good is a slippery concept, but well-functioning polities manage to settle on some version of it that most of their inhabitants find acceptable. A well-functioning polity can also design institutions that ensure the democratic accountability of its technocrats.</p>
<p>In one respect, Mattei’s account could have done with a bit more nuance. Mainstream economics is not intrinsically reactionary. Some of the economists and officials discussed in her book merit scorn. Pantaleoni in particular comes across as an ideologue — and a nasty piece of work to boot. The Treasury officials Blackett and Niemeyer were middling economic thinkers at best, and they embraced their roles as “hired prizefighters of the bourgeoisie,” as Marx would put it. Others like Hawtrey, Einaudi, A. C. Pigou, and Gustav Cassel, whatever their ideological commitments (Pigou was a Fabian socialist), were trying to cope with an unprecedentedly difficult set of policy problems.</p>
<p>The Great War left the economies of Europe damaged and heavily indebted. The global financial system was one national default away from Armageddon. Austerity wasn’t the answer, but the economists can be forgiven for thinking the cataclysmic dissolution of capitalism would be disastrous for everyone. Cassel recognized the need for debt forgiveness in some cases, a view hardly consistent with a rigid commitment to austerity. Hawtrey urged the Federal Reserve to intervene aggressively to counteract the deflation that accompanied the Great Depression; a technocrat he may have been, but he was not an austerity ideologue.</p>
<p>John Maynard Keynes takes some lumps from Mattei because he paid little analytical attention to the exploitative nature of the wage relation — and perhaps also because his vision of the good society assigned a central role to technocrats. But he was no champion of austerity. Aside from mentioning it briefly in a footnote, Mattei doesn’t say anything about the famous Macmillan Committee, whose 1931 report, largely written by Keynes, was in effect an argument against full-on austerity.</p>
<p>There is more work to be done on the origins of modern austerity policy. But that work will certainly have to take as its starting point Clara Mattei’s illuminating and provocative book.</p>

<p>Does DNA have anything like IF-statements, GOTO-jumps, or WHILE loops?</p>

<p>In software development, these constructs have the following functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>IF-statements:</strong> An IF statement executes the code in a subsequent code block if some specific condition is met.</li>
<li><strong>WHILE-loops:</strong> The code in a subsequent code block is executes as many times as specified, or as long as a specific condition is met.</li>
<li><strong>Function calls:</strong> The code temporarily bypasses the subsequent code block, executing instead some other code block. After execution of the other code block the code returns (sometimes with some value) and continues the execution of the subsequent block.</li>
<li><strong>GOTO-statements:</strong> The code bypasses the subsequent code block, jumping instead directly to some other block.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are constructs similar to these present in DNA? If yes, how are they implemented and what are they called?</p>

<p>Biological examples similar to programming statements:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>IF</code> : Transcriptional activator; when present a gene will be transcribed. In general there is no termination of events unless the signal is gone; the program ends only with the death of the cell. So the <code>IF</code> statement is always a part of a loop.</li>
<li><code>WHILE</code> : Transcriptional repressor; gene will be transcribed until repressor is not present.</li>
<li>There are no equivalents of <code>function</code> calls. All events happen is the
same space and there is always a likelihood of interference. One can
argue that organelles can act as a compartment that may have a
<code>function</code> like properties but they are highly complex and are
not just some kind of input-output devices.</li>
<li><code>GOTO</code> is always dependent on a condition. This can happen in case of certain network connections such as feedforward loops and branched pathways. For example if there is a signalling pathway like this: <br> <strong>A → B → C</strong> and there is another connection <strong>D → C</strong> then if somehow <strong>D</strong> is activated it will directly affect <strong>C</strong>, making <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> dispensable. </li>
</ul>

<p>Logic gates have been constructed using synthetic biological circuits. See <a href="http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v16/n3/abs/nrg3885.html" rel="noreferrer">this</a> review for more information. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Note</h2>

<p>Molecular biological processes cannot be directly compared to a computer code. It is the underlying logic that is important and not the statement construct itself and these examples should not be taken as absolute analogies. It is also to be noted that DNA is just a set of instructions and not really a fully functional entity (it is functional to some extent). However, even being just a code it is comparable to a HLL code that has to be compiled to execute its functions. See <a href="https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/29663/can-dna-rna-be-considered-as-natures-programming-language">this</a> post too.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that the cell, like many other physical systems, is analog in nature. Therefore, in most situations there is no 0/1 (binary) value of variables. Consider gene expression. If a transcriptional activator is present, the gene will be transcribed. However, if you keep increasing the concentration of the activator, the expression of that gene will increase until it reaches a saturation point. So there is no digital logic here. Having said that, I would add that switching behaviour is possible in biological systems (including gene expression) and is also used in many cases. Certain kinds of regulatory network structures can give rise to such dynamics. Co-operativity with or without positive feedback is one of the mechanisms that can implement switching behaviour.

<p>DNA is not analogous to computer code which renders your search for similar constructs in it meaningless. To give a couple of simple examples why this is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Computer code has a sequential order of execution; DNA acts in
parallel and out of sequence, it is not "executed".</p></li>
<li><p>Computer code has a strict and consistent meaning so the line <code>if x==4 : x=7</code> always does the same thing; coding DNA
translates to amino acids and it's the complex chemical interactions
between these acids which give proteins their function thus no piece
of coding DNA can be understood outside of its protein.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Biological systems do have some pathways that operate in a similar way to computers, but you should be looking for these at the protein level not the DNA level and, even then, you need to be extremely careful that your analogy does not impair your understanding of what is really happening.</p>

<p>There are certainly some comparisons that could be made between the way genes are expressed from DNA and logic functions, but they aren't great.</p>

<p>But synthetic Biology is really a blossoming new field that is attempting to integrate logic functions into biology, see e.g. <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n5/abs/nbt.2510.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Siuti et al. 2013. Synthetic circuits integrating logic and memory in living cells. Nature Biotechnology 31, 448–452. doi:10.1038/nbt.2510">Siuti et al (2013)</a>.</p>

<p>The above paper is a brilliant example of a group using bacteria to store information and assembling into biological circuits that can then be used to process logic functions. So its being done but not exactly in the way that you propose.</p>

<p>Just to add to previous answers, but <strong>transcriptional interference</strong> (see e.g. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2941638/">Shearwin et al., 2005</a>) can be seen as a form of IF-statement (or WHILE) in the sense that:</p>

<pre><code>if(x transcribed){not y transcribed}
</code></pre>

<p>The interference does not have to be binary though, and more common are graded responses. Transcriptional interference can also take place at the RNA stage (see e.g. <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v514/n7524/full/nature13671.html">Xue et al, 2014</a>), using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisense_RNA"><em>antisense RNA</em></a> and often providing a negative feedback loop, but the interference is then removed from the DNA, and does not represent a direct IF-statement analog at the DNA stage.</p>

<p>To me, GOTO mainly makes sense for sequential code execution, and this is not the case for DNA (lots of transcription is happening all the time in parallel). More generally, the parallel "execution" of DNA along with the continuous interactions and feedback loops between DNA, transcripts and proteins (among other things) also means that cellular processes are far less clear-cut and traceable than computer code, which means that computer code is a very poor metaphor for cellular processes and the functioning of DNA.</p>

<p>As WYSIWYG said there is no equivalent for function calls, as there will always be some interference. However one could argue that some modular pathways (eg. apoptosis signalling) can be seen as a "code block" where a certain input will (almost) certainly lead to a certain effect. The analogy with function calls is that, in describing many different mechanisms, it makes for shorter and more efficient "code" to consider everything between eg. caspase activation and cytochrome leakage as one block. Also, marking a protein with ubiquitin can maybe be seen as a function call for degradation.</p>

<p>Regarding function calls:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are no equivalents of function calls. All events happen is the same space and there is always a likelihood of interference. One can argue that organelles can act as a compartment that may have a function like properties but they are highly complex and are not just some kind of input-output devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As WYSIWYG said there is no equivalent for function calls, as there will always be some interference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that nuclear receptors are great examples of function calls. They hang out in the cytosol allowing normal programming to function in a normative fashion. Upon activation with their ligand, they translocate to the nucleus to activate subroutines of gene repression/activation and subsequent downstream processes. </p>

<p>In this fashion one could even argue that most initial ligand interactions that kick off cellular signaling are function calls. </p>

<p>In addition to the excellent WYSIWYG answer, there are some programming-like constructs at the lower level:</p>

<ul>
<li>FUNCTION CALL - replacing a single sub-unit inside a complex protein, assembled from multiple sub-units, each encoded by separate genes. This can also be seen as COMPOSITION, another programming concept.</li>

<p>The <b>British Post Office scandal</b> is a widespread and long-lasting series of individual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriages_of_justice" title="Miscarriages of justice">miscarriages of justice</a> which, between 1999 and 2015, involved over 700 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Ltd#Services" title="Post Office Ltd">subpostmasters</a> being wrongly convicted of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accounting" title="False accounting">false accounting</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud" title="Fraud">fraud</a> when shortfalls at their branches were in fact due to errors of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Limited" title="Post Office Limited">Post Office</a>'s Horizon accounting software. In 2019, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice" title="High Court of Justice">High Court</a> ruled that the Horizon system was faulty and in 2020 the government established a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_inquiry" title="Public inquiry">public inquiry</a>. Courts began to quash convictions from 2010. As of January 2024, some victims are still fighting to have their convictions overturned and receive compensation, the public inquiry is ongoing, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police" title="Metropolitan Police">Metropolitan Police</a> is investigating the Post Office for potential fraud offences.
</p><p>The Horizon accounting system was developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Computers_Limited" title="International Computers Limited">ICL Pathway</a>, owned by the Japanese company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujitsu" title="Fujitsu">Fujitsu</a>. In 1999, the Post Office started to roll out the new software to its branch and sub-offices, the latter managed by subpostmasters on a self-employed basis under contracts with the Post Office. Almost immediately, some subpostmasters noticed the new system reporting false shortfalls, sometimes for thousands of pounds. The Post Office insisted that the system was robust and, when shortfalls occurred, prosecuted the subpostmasters or forced them to make up the amount. The impact of court cases, criminal convictions, imprisonment, loss of livelihood and homes, debt and bankruptcy took a heavy toll on victims and their families, leading to stress, illness, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce" title="Divorce">divorce</a> and, in at least four cases, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a>. In May 2009, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Weekly" title="Computer Weekly">Computer Weekly</a> broke the story about problems with Horizon software and in September 2009 subpostmaster Alan Bates set up the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance (JFSA). In 2012, as a result of pressure from campaigners and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament_(United_Kingdom)" title="Members of Parliament (United Kingdom)">Members of Parliament</a>, the Post Office appointed forensic accountants Second Sight to conduct an investigation into Horizon. The investigators concluded that Horizon contained faults that could result in accounting discrepancies, but the Post Office insisted that there were no system-wide problems with the software.
</p><p>In 2019 a group of 555 subpostmasters led by Bates won a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action#England_and_the_United_Kingdom" title="Class action">group action</a> brought in court against the Post Office, with the judge ruling that Horizon contained bugs, errors and defects. The Post Office agreed to settle out of court for £58 million. The subpostmasters' legal costs amounted to £47 million, leaving them with only about £20,000 each. The government later agreed to supplement the settlement, as they were excluded from the compensation scheme set up by the Post Office for other victims of the scandal. The first convictions to be quashed were those of six subpostmasters who had been convicted in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrates%27_court_(England_and_Wales)" title="Magistrates' court (England and Wales)">magistrates' courts</a> and whose appeals were heard at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwark_Crown_Court" title="Southwark Crown Court">Southwark Crown Court</a> in December 2020. In allowing the appeal by 39 subpostmasters in April 2021, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Appeal_(England_and_Wales)" title="Court of Appeal (England and Wales)">Court of Appeal</a> judges ruled that in cases that relied on Horizon data a fair trial was not possible. Further appeal cases followed.
</p><p>In September 2020, the government established the <i>Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry</i>, chaired by retired judge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyn_Williams" title="Wyn Williams">Sir Wyn Williams</a>, to look into the implementation and failings of the Horizon system that led to the prosecution of subpostmasters and termination of their contracts. Evidence was due to be heard from subpostmasters, the Post Office, UK Government Investment, the Department for Business and Trade, and others.
</p><p>A four-part television drama, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Bates_vs_The_Post_Office" title="Mr Bates vs The Post Office">Mr Bates vs the Post Office</a></i>, was broadcast on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)" title="ITV (TV network)">ITV</a> in January 2024, after which the scandal became a major news story and political issue.

</p><p>The contract to create the system for Post Office Counters Limited and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefits_Agency" title="Benefits Agency">Benefits Agency</a> was awarded in May 1996 to ICL Pathway Limited,<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> a subsidiary created for the purpose in 1995 by British computer company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Computers_Limited" title="International Computers Limited">ICL</a>, which was itself majority-owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujitsu" title="Fujitsu">Fujitsu</a> of Japan.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>By 1998, the Pathway project was two years behind schedule, costs had increased, and there were concerns that magnetic swipe cards were becoming obsolete. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Blair_ministry" title="First Blair ministry">Labour</a> had come into power in 1997 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Byers" title="Stephen Byers">Stephen Byers</a>, one of the responsible government ministers, later called the working relationships between the contracted parties "dysfunctional".<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> The government considered cancellation, but Fujitsu pressured the UK government to sign off on the IT system<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> and after lengthy negotiation it was agreed in May 1999 that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Security_(United_Kingdom)" title="Department of Social Security (United Kingdom)">Department of Social Security</a> would withdraw and the benefit payment card would be abandoned.<sup id="cite_ref-Beer-11Oct22_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-Beer-11Oct22-1">[1]</a></sup> The project would continue with a reduced scope under the Horizon name at a cost of up to £900M, in order to replace the paper-based system used in post offices.<sup id="cite_ref-CW-Nov00_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-CW-Nov00-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1999, the Post Office commenced the roll-out of Horizon.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> The roll-out reached 10,000 branches by August 2000,<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> and deployment to over 13,000 offices took place in 2000 and 2001.<sup id="cite_ref-CW-Nov00_7-1"><a href="#cite_note-CW-Nov00-7">[7]</a></sup> A precursor of the Horizon system had been rolled out to 300 post offices in 1995.

</p><p>On 8 April 2021, after the problems had caused scandal, Post Office chief executive Nick Read announced that the Horizon system would be replaced by a new IT system that would be "more user-friendly, easier to adapt for new products and services, and cloud-based to ensure easy maintenance and ready interoperability with other systems". He said: "This will not be easy – it will after all be among the biggest, if not the biggest, IT roll-out in the country when the time comes.

The action taken against the Post Office took the form first of the group litigation in the name of <i>Bates and others</i>, a civil action in the High Court by some 600 people, and the linked appeal cases, first of <i>R v Christoper Trousdale &amp; Others</i> in the Crown Court, and then of <i>Hamilton and Others</i> in the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). In the <i>Trousdale</i> and <i>Hamilton</i> appeals, the findings in the civil case (<i>Bates</i>) were used to support the appeals against convictions. In <i>Bates</i>, six 'lead claimants' and 23 'Common Issues' were identified and agreed to enable the court to examine the 600 cases. The court of appeal judgment,<sup id="cite_ref-EWCA_Crim_577_63-2"><a href="#cite_note-EWCA_Crim_577-63">[63]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 72, 127 &amp;137">: 72, 127 &amp;137 </span></sup> that all of the successful appeals had suffered a prosecution that was "an affront to the conscience of the court", has important implications for any future civil cases against the Post Office.<sup id="cite_ref-fiona1_76-0"><a href="#cite_note-fiona1-76">[76]</a></sup>

<blockquote><p>The recusal application was issued the day after Mr Godeseth's cross-examination had made it clear, not only that this remote access existed, but after he was taken in careful cross-examination through specific examples of Fujitsu personnel manipulating branch accounts, and leading to discrepancies in branch accounts. I am aware that criticism of the Post Office and Fujitsu in this respect may prove to be controversial, as earlier criticism of certain aspects of the Post Office's case in Judgment (No. 3) was not well received by it. However, if criticism is justified, I consider it would be detrimental to proper resolution of the group litigation if that criticism were to be withheld simply because it might lead to a further negative reaction by the Post Office. It is also an inherent part of the judicial function in any litigation to make findings, which may include criticisms where justified, that may be contrary to a litigant's own view of the merits of their case. Some litigants are so convinced of the righteousness of their own position that they consistently refuse to accept any possible view of the litigation other than their own. Such a blinkered view is rarely helpful, and would be particularly unhelpful from a publicly owned institution.</p></blockquote>

Grabiner is widely described as a 'legal heavyweight'.<sup id="cite_ref-111"><a href="#cite_note-111">[111]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ironman_110-1"><a href="#cite_note-ironman-110">[110]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-112"><a href="#cite_note-112">[112]</a></sup> Statements supporting the recusal application alleged that paragraphs 22 to 25 of Judgment No 3 were findings, or observations that fell outside the scope of the Common Issues trial. Paragraph 24 of that judgment gave the clear impression that the judge has already formed a firm view on these matters that will prevent him from taking an impartial view when they are revisited at subsequent trials.<sup id="cite_ref-J4_113-0"><a href="#cite_note-J4-113">[113]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 17, 18">: 17, 18 </span></sup> The statement further alleged that the judgment contained critical invective directed at the Post Office and that parts harshly criticised the Post Office's witnesses on irrelevant matters. The subpostmasters argued that the Post Office was insufficiently specific and the judge required the Post Office to identify the relevant paragraphs of Judgment No 3. In response, the Post Office cited 110 paragraphs.<sup id="cite_ref-J4_113-1"><a href="#cite_note-J4-113">[113]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 116">: 116 </span></sup>

He replied "It was made at board level within the client and it also involved the need for me to be got up to speed from a standing start. And I am not the only judicial figure or barrister that has looked at this with a view to reaching that conclusion. It has also been looked at by another very senior person before the decision was taken to make this application. The delay, such as it is, is very, very tiny".<sup id="cite_ref-J4_113-2"><a href="#cite_note-J4-113">[113]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 279">: 279 </span></sup> This submission was rejected.<sup id="cite_ref-J4_113-3"><a href="#cite_note-J4-113">[113]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 280">: 280 </span></sup> The judge decided the issue of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiver" title="Waiver">waiver</a> as a result of the delay in making the application for recusal.
</p>
<blockquote><p>Even if I had found that there were grounds of apparent bias on the face of Judgment No. 3, I would not have recused myself. This is because of the fact that the Post Office waited until almost two weeks after it had received Judgment No. 3 before it did anything in respect of making an application to recuse.<sup id="cite_ref-J4_113-4"><a href="#cite_note-J4-113">[113]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 274">: 274 </span></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>The issuing by the Post Office of the recusal application on 21 March 2019 caused significant disruption to the Horizon Issues trial which had started on 11 March 2019, and to the Group Litigation as a whole. The subpostmasters applied for the costs of that application; the Post Office sought that the judge reserve costs, in the following terms:<sup id="cite_ref-J5_106-1"><a href="#cite_note-J5-106">[106]</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote><p>the court can't be sure that things will happen in the future that will affect and alter its view about incidence of costs. It simply cannot do so. If it does so now, in my submission as a matter of principle, that would evidence a predetermination or would go towards suggesting the court has reached a view about matters as to how things are going to pan out in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>The judge was troubled by this submission. Inherent was a veiled or implied threat that the Post Office will say that the overall outcome of the litigation, or other future issues, has been decided. The Post Office was attempting to put the court <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_terrorem" title="In terrorem">in terrorem</a></i> again. After asserting no predecision he said, "I do nonetheless consider that it is appropriate that I consider whether to make a costs order now ..." After considering cases cited, the application by the Post Office to reserve costs was dismissed. "The claimants would not be on an equal footing with the Post Office, a publicly funded body, if I reserved the costs of the Common Issues trial until the very end of the litigation ... I do not however consider that the presence of litigation funding should sway this decision one way or the other. I agree with Mr Cavender that the presence of such funding should not put a claimant in a better position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the correct stage in litigation at which costs should be addressed, compared to a non-funded party. However, regardless of who is funding litigation, a funder or an individual litigant, cash flow is a relevant consideration for most litigants. It is a consideration that might weigh less heavily upon publicly funded bodies such as the Post Office, but even such entities are likely to be concerned to some extent with cash flow."<sup id="cite_ref-J5_106-2"><a href="#cite_note-J5-106">[106]</a></sup> Of the subpostmasters' submissions that their award of costs should not be reduced, the court rejected them.<sup id="cite_ref-J4_113-7"><a href="#cite_note-J4-113">[113]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-J5_106-3"><a href="#cite_note-J5-106">[106]</a></sup>

<p>This judgment concerns the operation and functionality of the Horizon system itself. The hearings took place in March, April, June and July 2019. The hearings were interrupted by the Post Office's application for the judge to recuse, to appeal his refusal to recuse (<a href="#Permission_to_appeal_Judgment_No_4_–_May_2019">judgment 4</a>), and his <a href="#Permission_to_appeal_Judgment_No_3_–_November_2019">judgment 3</a>. The judgment was published in December 2019. Twenty-nine bugs, errors and defects were identified<sup id="cite_ref-bugs_115-0"><a href="#cite_note-bugs-115">[115]</a></sup> and analysed. Witnesses for the subpostmasters and for the Post Office submitted statements and gave oral evidence. Documents that had been submitted, and further documents, the submission of which had been resisted were, after argument and rulings, submitted. These included the 'Known Error Logs' and the 'PEAKs', a browser-based software incident and problem management system used by Fujitsu for the Post Office account.

</p><p>The important judgment was about whether the Horizon computer system worked and was "robust", which the Post Office said it was.  Again, the judge found overwhelmingly in favour of the subpostmasters and that the original version of Horizon was "not robust" and, as to the later version, "its robustness was questionable, and did not justify the confidence placed in it by the Post Office in terms of its accuracy."<sup id="cite_ref-116"><a href="#cite_note-116">[116]</a></sup>
</p><p>During this trial, the Post Office issued an application that the judge recuse himself. That led first to Fraser J's Judgment No. 4, and then to an application for permission to appeal <a href="#Permission_to_appeal_Judgment_No_3_–_November_2019">that judgment</a>.

<p>Lord Justice Coulson refused permission to appeal judgment No 3 and handed down his written reasons on 22 November.<sup id="cite_ref-coulson2_117-0"><a href="#cite_note-coulson2-117">[117]</a></sup> Before dealing with the 26 grounds that formed the basis of the application the judge set out a number of reasons that he felt militated against granting the Post Office permission to appeal. In short, the judge said:
</p>
<ul><li>The trial was long and complex – 6 weeks – 60 lever arch files – 20 witnesses of fact. The judgment is 320 pages and 1,122 paragraphs long. No judge will ever know more about this case generally, and the Common Issues specifically, than Fraser J.</li>
<li>The oral hearing of the permission-to-appeal application had demonstrated the danger that consideration of one issue opened up another, and another until the trial is re-fought. That is manifestly not in the interests of justice.</li>
<li>Many of the Post Office's challenges are challenges to the findings of fact made by Fraser J. Challenges to such findings of fact are not open to an appellant in the position of the Post Office.<sup id="cite_ref-Fage_118-0"><a href="#cite_note-Fage-118">[118]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-119"><a href="#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup> Fraser J's conclusions of law were so entangled with his findings of fact that Coulson LJ considered it neither just, nor practicable to endeavour to separate them out.</li>
<li>The Post Office made sweeping statements of the judgment which were demonstrably wrong. The Post Office takes findings "either wholly out of context, misstated, or otherwise not correctly summarised".</li>
<li>Fraser J dealt comprehensively with why he refused permission to appeal in his separate judgment of 17 June 2019 which itself runs to 91 paragraphs, and Coulson LJ said that he agreed with Fraser J's detailed reasons for refusing the application to appeal.</li>
<li>The Post Office's approach in this application was, as Fraser J correctly labelled it "attritional". The most obvious example is the Post Office's anxiety to state what they do not like about a particular proposal from the subpostmasters or the consequential finding by Fraser J, without providing any practical alternative. None of this engenders any confidence in the underlying merits or prospects of success of the Post Office's application for permission to appeal.</li>
<li>There is no greater or wider right to permission to appeal just because this is group litigation; indeed, from the point of view of practical justice the opposite may well be the case. In any event, the subpostmasters' contract was no longer in use.</li>
<li>This application is founded on the premise that the nation's most trusted brand was not obliged to treat their subpostmasters with good faith, and instead entitled to treat them in capricious or arbitrary ways which would not be unfamiliar to a mid-Victorian factory-owner (the Post Office's right to terminate contracts arbitrarily and the subpostmasters alleged strict liability to the Post Office for errors made by the Post Office's own computer system, being just two of many examples). Given the unique relationship that the Post Office has with its subpostmasters, that position was a startling starting point for any consideration of these grounds of appeal.<sup id="cite_ref-coulson2_117-1"><a href="#cite_note-coulson2-117">[117]</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>The application was refused.

They are not a tactic to be strategically deployed by a losing party." She quotes Coulson as saying "Without making any finding, he stated that he at least understood the claimants' submission that the recusal application and the permission to appeal application were made in an attempt to de-rail the litigation as a whole."<sup id="cite_ref-RecusalLN_114-2"><a href="#cite_note-RecusalLN-114">[114]</a></sup>

</p><p>At the commencement of the case, three of the applicant subpostmasters were represented by Paul Marshall and Flora Page, his junior. In December 2020, Marshall and Page resigned from the case under threat from the court of contempt proceedings.

</p><p>Forty-two historical convictions of dishonesty were referred by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Cases_Review_Commission" title="Criminal Cases Review Commission">Criminal Cases Review Commission</a> (CCRC) to the Court of Appeal. "The CCRC referred the cases because it considered that two cogent lines of argument in relation to abuse of process were available to each appellant: first, that the reliability of Horizon data was essential to the prosecution and conviction, and it was not possible for the trial process to be fair; and secondly, that it was an affront to the public conscience for the appellant to face criminal proceedings."<sup id="cite_ref-EWCA_Crim_577_63-4"><a href="#cite_note-EWCA_Crim_577-63">[63]</a></sup> Each of the forty-two cases was considered individually. Of the forty-two, just two had previously appealed, unsuccessfully.
</p><p>The Post Office accepted Fraser's findings of the unreliability of the Horizon systems and, in some cases, of inadequate investigation, and/or of insufficient disclosure. In these cases, the Post Office did not resist the appeal on Ground 1 but it would oppose Ground 2. The Post Office divided the appellants into three groups; A, 4 cases where it asserted that both categories 1 and 2 abuse of process applied, group B, 35 cases where category 1 applied, but not category 2, and group C, where neither category applied. The Post Office would not seek a retrial of any appellant whose appeal is allowed.

That hearing led to further hearings in November, December, and January. The court addressed three issues:
</p>
<ul><li>information from Brian Altman QC, counsel for Post Office, alleging potential contempt of court by Ms Page, junior counsel for three appellants (all in group B), by improper disclosure of the 'Clarke advice';</li>
<li>"the issue of whether an appellant whose appeal was not resisted by POL on Ground 1 was entitled to argue Ground 2;"<sup id="cite_ref-EWCA_Crim_577_63-6"><a href="#cite_note-EWCA_Crim_577-63">[63]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 79">: 79 </span></sup></li>
<li>an application by journalist Nick Wallis for the release of the 'Clarke advice'. Mr Wallis' application failed.</li></ul>
<p>Mr Altman's information to the court on 19 November led to hearings on 3 December 10 December and 15 January before the present court, and to Marshall and Page resigning from the case. On 3 December, Altman said, "I am confident that the court understands why we brought these matters to the court's attention. ... For the avoidance of any doubt, I should like to make clear that the Post Office has not made application for anyone's committal for contempt. ... We have sought to assist the court as we were invited to do," referring to signed undertakings, "... the court suggested that all legal representatives sign an express undertaking not to use disclosed material other than for the proper conduct of these proceedings." Lord Justice Holroyde interjected, "I thought you suggested that," and Altman replied, "Ultimately, my Lord, I think it was at the suggestion of the court but that is what has happened and that is what has been done."<sup id="cite_ref-auto_128-0"><a href="#cite_note-auto-128">[128]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 137–141">: 137–141 </span></sup>

By 4 December, barristers Paul Marshall and Fiona Page had resigned from the Hamilton case. Mr Marshall had written two letters to the court. Of the second, Nick Wallis said, "It makes for troubling reading."<sup id="cite_ref-x258_126-1"><a href="#cite_note-x258-126">[126]</a></sup> In April 2021, the matter came before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Fulford" title="Adrian Fulford">Lord Justice Fulford</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_High_Court_judges_of_England_and_Wales" title="List of High Court judges of England and Wales">Mrs Justice Cutts</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_High_Court_judges_of_England_and_Wales" title="List of High Court judges of England and Wales">Mr Justice Saini</a> when it was declared no further action to be taken.

The minister replied that the settlement agreed in December was full and final and therefore excluded from the scope of the inquiry ... the Post Office is not conducting any private prosecutions and has no plans to do so ... only the courts can decide on criminal matters, such as whether to overturn the postmasters' convictions, so it would not be appropriate for the inquiry to look at these questions, especially when the court process is still ongoing.<sup id="cite_ref-145"><a href="#cite_note-145">[145]</a></sup>

In the same article, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Moorhead" title="Richard Moorhead">Richard Moorhead</a>, professor of law and professional ethics at Exeter Law School, said "the SRA and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Standards_Board" title="Bar Standards Board">BSB</a> should investigate whether anyone should be held to account amid professional concerns about who was responsible for disclosure issues."<sup id="cite_ref-lg26Apr_71-1"><a href="#cite_note-lg26Apr-71">[71]</a></sup> Solicitors for subpostmasters wrote to the government (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Business,_Energy_%26_Industrial_Strategy" title="Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy">DBEIS</a>) asking it to re-establish the inquiry on a statutory footing and to consult again on the terms of reference.

</p><p>On 28 July, the government (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Business,_Energy_%26_Industrial_Strategy" title="Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy">DBEIS</a>) issued its fourth statement of approach, which included the inquiry terms of reference. After setting out preliminary and organisational matters – the appointment of solicitors and counsel to the inquiry – establishment of a website and of premises, etc., the statement set out terms of reference, in essence:
</p>
<dl><dd>A: Understand and acknowledge what went wrong and key lessons that must be learned.</dd>
<dd>B: Obtain all available relevant evidence from the Post Office, Fujitsu, BEIS and UKGI to establish the failings of Horizon and the Post Office's use of information from Horizon.</dd>
<dd>C: Assess whether the Post Office has learned and has delivered or made good progress on the changes necessary.</dd>
<dd>D: Assess whether the commitments made by Post Office Ltd have been properly delivered.</dd>
<dd>E: Assess whether processes and information provided by the Post Office to postmasters are sufficient.</dd>
<dd>F: Examine the historical and current governance and whistleblowing controls are now sufficient to ensure that these failures do not happen again.</dd></dl>
<blockquote><p>"The Inquiry will consider only those matters set out in the preceding sections A-F. The Inquiry will not consider any issue which is outside the scope of the powers conferred upon the Inquiry by the Inquiries Act 2005. The Horizon group damages settlement (albeit the Inquiry may examine the events leading to the settlement), and/or the engagement or findings of any other supervisory or complaints mechanisms, including in the public sector, are outside the Inquiry's scope."<sup id="cite_ref-152"><a href="#cite_note-152">[152]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>During the non-statutory inquiry, two public hearings were held in early 2021. A preliminary hearing on the provisional List of Issues was held on 8 November 2021. The Human Impact Hearings opened on 14 February 2022, at Juxon House, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London" title="City of London">City of London</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-153"><a href="#cite_note-153">[153]</a></sup> The Phase Two hearings, covering the Horizon IT System procurement, design, pilot, roll out and modifications, started in October 2022.<sup id="cite_ref-154"><a href="#cite_note-154">[154]</a></sup> They were streamed online, as are the later phases of the inquiry.<sup id="cite_ref-155"><a href="#cite_note-155">[155]</a></sup>
</p><p>
Richard Moorhead, professor of law and professional ethics, University of Exeter, made written and oral submissions to the Williams inquiry. Moorhead, in an oral submission to the Williams inquiry, said:<sup id="cite_ref-Moohead_oral_156-0"><a href="#cite_note-Moohead_oral-156">[156]</a></sup></p><blockquote><p>If I can end by putting the case metaphorically for a moment. Considering the Horizon saga without considering the lawyering, and without lifting professional privilege, would be a bit like considering Watergate without considering the White House Tapes. Essential, telling, [and] perhaps vital information will be missing. The abuse of power, the injustice, who did it and why, will not be properly understood. Sir, you must, to discharge the Inquiry's remit, you must do the equivalent of listening to the tapes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Immediately after the November hearing, Williams said he would ask Post Office Limited, IT supplier Fujitsu, the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy and the UK government to waive privilege in respect of material relevant to the inquiry's terms of reference, and he set a deadline for response.<sup id="cite_ref-157"><a href="#cite_note-157">[157]</a></sup> On 16 November, Wyn Williams reported that all four parties had responded within the timescale specified and added "The response of POL, on any view, goes a very long way towards meeting the request I made of them. It is clear to me that in respect of many of the most crucial lines of investigation for the Inquiry POL has waived legal professional privilege."<sup id="cite_ref-158"><a href="#cite_note-158">[158]</a></sup> The Post Office published its response to the request on 15 November 2021.<sup id="cite_ref-159"><a href="#cite_note-159">[159]</a></sup> Government (BEIS) said that it was its "firm position that the inquiry should not be obstructed by the assertion of legal privilege", but the government-owned Post Office was more cautious. It agreed to a limited waiver over relevant material but would maintain privilege over documents relevant to ongoing litigation/remediation activities. The Post Office maintained privilege over documents relevant to the ongoing group litigation claim in the Employment Tribunal. It maintained privilege over legal advice related to the Historical Shortfall Scheme and to current and anticipated claims from individuals whose criminal convictions have been or will be quashed. This could have wide-reaching ramifications for the inquiry; if advice is withheld on the basis that it is relevant to current and anticipated claims from those who have had their convictions quashed, this may lead to gaps in the inquiry.<sup id="cite_ref-160"><a href="#cite_note-160">[160]</a></sup>
</p><p>On 13 February 2022, in a report prior to the start of the Wyn Williams hearings, the BBC quoted a prosecuted, jailed and subsequently cleared subpostmaster: "I want someone else to be charged and jailed like I was."

</p><p>The inquiry issued an interim report on 17 July 2023. The recommendations were as follows:<sup id="cite_ref-164"><a href="#cite_note-164">[164]</a></sup>
</p>
<ul><li>The Horizon Compensation Advisory Board (HCAB) should not be prevented from monitoring individual cases</li>
<li>HCAB shall produce written reports in respect of each of their meetings</li>
<li>Membership of HCAB should be increased to ensure that it has sufficient capacity</li>
<li>The Government should within 28 days seek directions under section 306 of the Insolvency Act 1986 to ensure that compensation payable to bankrupt claimants is not diverted to insolvency practitioners</li>
<li>The government should publish proposals for ensuring that applicants to all schemes are treated equally and fairly</li>
<li>The government should ensure that legislation is enacted to allow compensation under group litigation orders to be made to applicants after midnight on 7 August 2024</li>
<li>No applications for compensation to the Horizon Shortfall Scheme should be entertained after such date as agreed by the minister</li></ul>
<p>The government accepted the recommendations in full or in part on 26 October 2023.<sup id="cite_ref-165"><a href="#cite_note-165">[165]</a></sup>

Large systems are complex and lay people cannot discern whether these systems are reliable or be confident that they can spot errors as they happen. It is difficult even for experts to judge the reliability of systems or detect any but the simplest errors.<sup id="cite_ref-DEESLR-PMarshall01_176-0"><a href="#cite_note-DEESLR-PMarshall01-176">[176]</a></sup>
</p><p>If the legal system and wider society are to have any confidence in computer evidence the providers of such evidence must be able to demonstrate that they are managing their systems responsibly.<sup id="cite_ref-DEESLR-TMcCormack01_177-0"><a href="#cite_note-DEESLR-TMcCormack01-177">[177]</a></sup> This was not the case at the Post Office and Fujitsu. Horizon was not subjected to a full, rigorous system audit.<sup id="cite_ref-DEESLR-JDChristie02_72-1"><a href="#cite_note-DEESLR-JDChristie02-72">[72]</a></sup> In 2010, senior Post Office management took a decision that Horizon would not be subjected to an independent review because:
</p>
<blockquote><p>If one were commissioned – any investigation would need to be disclosed in court. Although we would be doing the review to comfort others, any perception that POL doubts its own systems would mean that all criminal prosecutions would have to be stayed. It would also beg a question for the Court of Appeal over past prosecutions and imprisonments.<sup id="cite_ref-Ismay_Report_178-0"><a href="#cite_note-Ismay_Report-178">[178]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>No independent review was conducted until Second Sight was commissioned in 2012, and the contract was terminated abruptly. The Post Office have not offered any evidence that their own internal auditors conducted an appropriate system audit.<sup id="cite_ref-DEESLR-JDChristie02_72-2"><a href="#cite_note-DEESLR-JDChristie02-72">[72]</a></sup>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>It is now widely accepted that an </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/the-teen-mental-illness-epidemic" rel="">epidemic of mental illness began among American teens in the early 2010s</a><span>. What caused it? Many commentators point to events in the USA around that time, such as a particularly horrific school shooting in 2012. But if the epidemic started in many nations at the same time, then such country-specific theories would not work. We’d need to find a global event or trend, and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis doesn’t match the timing at all, as </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140197121000853" rel="">Jean Twenge and I</a><span> have </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/social-media-mental-illness-epidemic" rel="">shown</a><span>.</span></em></p><p><em><span>In our 2018 book </span><a href="https://www.thecoddling.com/" rel="">The Coddling of the American Mind</a><span>, Greg Lukianoff and I presented evidence that the same trends were happening in Canada and the United Kingdom—not just the rise in depression and anxiety, but also the overprotection of children, the rise of “safetyism,” and the shouting down of speakers on university campuses when students deemed the speaker to be “harmful.”&nbsp; It seemed that all the Anglo nations were setting up their children for failure in the same ways at the same time.&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><em><span>In 2019 I went on a speaking tour of Australia and New Zealand (thanks to </span><a href="https://thinkinc.org.au/" rel="">Think Inc</a><span>) and discovered that the same trends were coming, more slowly, to the Southern hemisphere Anglo nations too.&nbsp; I then created two new collaborative review documents, one for </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19maacSq_DYIaQ-IccCS3psBAvCy24GNt709Tl_L5AhM/edit" rel="">Australia</a><span>, and one for </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vq10ex65igy5PP2IQYjnjvbGaGUFBBo8VLQRtaS2KGI/edit" rel="">New Zealand</a><span>, to gather all the empirical studies and journalistic accounts I could find.&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><em><span>In early 2020, just as COVID swept in, I hired </span><a href="https://zach-rausch.com/" rel="">Zach Rausch</a><span> as a research assistant to help me handle these collaborative review docs. I connected with Zach, who was finishing his master’s degree in Psychological Science at SUNY New Paltz, after reading his </span><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/darwins-subterranean-world/202002/gendered-values-in-higher-education" rel="">blog post</a><span> about his research related to The Coddling. Zach and I created many more collaborative review docs for many more countries and topics, which you can find (and add to) </span><a href="http://jonathanhaidt.com/reviews" rel="">on this page</a><span>.</span></em><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><em><span>In 2021, as I was beginning to work on the </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/welcome-to-the-after-babel-substack" rel="">Babel project</a><span>, I told Zach that it was urgent that we figure out just how international the mental illness epidemic was. Is it just happening in the five countries of what is sometimes called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglosphere" rel="">The Anglosphere</a><span>? Is it all Western countries? Is it happening everywhere? Go figure it out and report back to me.&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><em>The rest of this post is Part 1 of Zach’s report, in his voice. I think his findings are momentous and should cause an immediate global rethinking of what children need to have a healthy childhood, and what obstacles to development arrived around the globe around 2012. </em><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>— Jon Haidt</strong></p><p><em><span>(Addendum April 19th: Zach published his second post on international mental health trends. The post explores trends in the five Nordic Nations: You can read the report </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/international-mental-illness-part-two" rel="">here</a><span>).</span></em><span> </span></p><p>When Jon first asked me to figure out whether teen mental health had collapsed around the globe after 2012, I thought he was nuts. The task felt impossible and beyond what I thought I could accomplish. But it was precisely this kind of work that I aspired to do. I set aside my doubt, put my head down, and gathered every relevant study I could find on teen mental health trends across the globe. In a series of posts, I will share with you what I have found so far. I address the Anglosphere today. In future posts, I’ll show what I have learned about Scandinavia and other developed nations and what I have learned from five international surveys, each with data from dozens of nations. There is much more to be done, especially beyond Western countries.</p><p><span>The short answer to Jon’s question is: </span><em>Teen mental health plummeted across the Western world in the early 2010s, particularly for girls and particularly in the most individualistic nations.</em><span> The longer answer begins below and will continue in parts 2 and 3.</span></p><p><span>As Jon mentioned in the introduction to this post, he and Greg Lukianoff had already found evidence that the mental illness epidemic was occurring in Canada, the UK, and the USA. But it has been more than four years since the publication of </span><em>The Coddling of the American Mind, </em><span>and we now have access to a lot more data, so let me run through the five countries.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/the-teen-mental-illness-epidemic" rel="">two</a><span> </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/mental-health-liberal-girls" rel="">previous</a><span> posts of the </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/" rel="">After Babel Substack</a><span>, Jon has shown the astounding rise of mental illness among American adolescents since 2010. Therefore, I won’t cover the United States in much detail. However, I will include a few figures to provide a baseline for the countries we explore in the rest of this post. For each country, I try to show at least one graph or study on mood disorders (anxiety and/or depression), which is usually self-reported, and one on something related to self-harm or psychiatric hospitalization, which is usually not based on self-reports from teens. (Note that I defer the discussion of suicide rates to a future post. You can find data and graphs about suicide rates in each of the Collaborative Review Docs that I link to.)&nbsp;</span></p><p>Figure 1 shows the percentage of US teens since 2004 who reported having a major depressive episode in the last year.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png" width="1092" height="690" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:690,&quot;width&quot;:1092,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Percent of teens with Major Depression in the last year&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Percent of teens with Major Depression in the last year" title="Percent of teens with Major Depression in the last year" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7469572-87dd-49d8-be9f-aca6d6290a29_1092x690.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em><strong>Figure 1.</strong><span> Percent of teens with Major Depression in the last year.

National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH).</span></em></p><p>To summarize, four trends emerged in the data from the USA, which we will call the “basic pattern.” They include:</p><blockquote><p>A) A substantial increase in adolescent anxiety and depression rates begins in the early 2010s.</p><p>B) A substantial increase in adolescent self-harm rates or psychiatric hospitalizations begins in the early 2010s.</p><p>C) The increases are larger for girls than for boys (in absolute terms).</p><p>D) The increases are larger for Gen Z than for older generations (in absolute terms).&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><span>Note that there are two ways to calculate increases. We can measure an increase in </span><em>absolute</em><span> terms, e.g., a rise from 5% to 15% of teens with a diagnosis is a ten percentage-point increase, or we can report it in </span><em>relative</em><span> terms, e.g., a rise from 5% to 15% is a 300% increase, relative to the anchor point. Both are important. From a utilitarian or public health point of view, we care more about the absolute increase, for it tells us the number of people affected. From a psychological research point of view, we also care about the relative increase since a large relative increase may alert us that something is changing for that group, even if its illness rate only moves from 2.1% to 4.3%. We decided to report the relative changes on our graphs since that is hard to calculate by eye. For example, as shown in Figure 1, the </span><em>absolut</em><span>e increase from 2010 to 2021 was much larger for girls (17.3%) than for boys (7.1%), and that jumps out at you as soon as you look at the graph. However, the </span><em>relative</em><span> increase was slightly larger for boys (161%) than for girls (145%), which tells us that whatever is happening, it’s also affecting boys quite a lot.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>With this basic pattern in mind, let’s move north to see how Canadian teens are doing.

Since 2010, there has been a 138% increase in self-harm hospitalization for 13-17-year-old girls (from a low of 294.0 per 100,000 teens in 2010 to a high of 701.6 per 100,000 in 2017). The boys show an increase too, but from a much lower baseline, and there is no spike around 2012. Again, the pattern and timing are very similar to the USA: no sign of a problem before 2010, and then something terrible happens to Canadian teens in the early 2010s, especially to the girls.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, Canada also shares the basic pattern. Although we do not have specific changes in rates of anxiety and depression, we see a significant decline in mental well-being among young Canadians. The changes in well-being and self-harm are larger for girls than for boys, in both absolute and relative terms. And the changes in well-being were much larger for the youngest cohort than for the older ones.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Because Jon and Greg had been studying the UK along with the US, all of the studies on teenage mental health trends in the UK were included in the original collaborative review doc, “</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1diMvsMeRphUH7E6D1d_J7R6WbDdgnzFHDHPx9HXzR5o/edit#" rel="">Adolescent Mood Disorders Since 2010: A Collaborative Review</a><span>.”</span></p><p><span>An essential UK data source, the </span><a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-of-children-and-young-people-in-england/2017/2017" rel="">United Kingdom National Health Survey</a><span>, examined trends among 11- to 15-year-old English boys and girls for anxiety and depressive disorders at 3 points (1999, 2004, 2017).

This graph confirms something we see in the American data repeatedly: something big seems to have happened to girls around 2012.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png" width="1428" height="798" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:798,&quot;width&quot;:1428,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b9ca542-ccc9-4f3c-b630-c2f46e52d281_1428x798.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Figure 9.</strong><em><span> UK Teens, Self-harm rates per 100,000</span><strong>. </strong><span>Aurum and GOLD datasets of the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD).

We do not believe that the underlying rates of anxiety disorders increased as quickly as the lines in Figure 11 suggest. Nonetheless, given what we are seeing in all of the Anglosphere countries, and given the self-harm data below, we believe that much or most of the rise is real.

The timing of that event is exactly the </span><em>opposite</em><span> of what you’d expect, namely: the epidemic should have started in 2009 and then gotten progressively </span><em>better</em><span> after 2012 as the economy improved in the USA and other countries. In an </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/academic-pressure-social-media" rel="">earlier post, Jean Twenge showed</a><span> that it can’t be caused by rising academic pressure either. And it certainly can’t be caused by the most popular theory we hear in the USA: school shootings and other stress-inducing events. Why would school shootings or active shooter drills implemented only in the USA lead to an immediate epidemic across the entire English-speaking world?</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-111288830" href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/international-mental-illness-part-one#footnote-4-111288830" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span></p><p>At this point, there is only one theory we know of that can explain why the same thing happened to girls in so many countries at the same time: the rapid global movement from flip phones (where you can’t do social media) to smartphones and the phone-based childhood. The first smartphone with a front-facing camera (the iPhone 4) came out in 2010, just as teens were trading in their flip phones for smartphones in large numbers. (Few teens owned an iPhone in its first few years). Facebook bought Instagram in 2012, which gave the platform a huge boost in publicity and users. So 2012 was the first year that very large numbers of girls in the developed world were spending hours each day posting photos of themselves and scrolling through hundreds of carefully edited photos of other girls.&nbsp;</p><p><span>If you suddenly transform the social lives of girls, putting them onto platforms that prioritize social comparison and performance, platforms where we know that </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(18)30060-9/fulltext" rel="">heavy users are three times more likely to be depressed</a><span> than light users, might that have some impact on the mental health of girls around the world? We think so, but if anyone can offer another explanation that fits the graphs we’ve shown in this post, we’d love to hear it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This concludes the first part of my report. In Part 2, I’ll examine the Scandinavian countries. In Part 3, I’ll examine studies that collected evidence from multiple countries, mostly in Europe. In later posts, I’ll examine the limited data we have from non-Western nations. To give you a sneak preview, there </span><em>are</em><span> cultural variations within the West, and the Anglosphere was hit a bit harder than other regions. Whatever it was that changed about childhood in the early 2010s, it took the greatest toll on teens in the most individualistic nations.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Please tune in next week, and subscribe to the After Babel Substack if you have not already done so.&nbsp;(It’s free.)</p><p>Here is the list of open-source collaborative review documents that Jon and I curate to track the mental illness epidemic around the globe.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="quartz-body"><article><p><em>Atuin supercharges your productivity by enabling you to rapidly retrieve any command you’ve ran, at any time, from anywhere. It stores your shell history in a database, recording additional command context and syncing it (e2e encrypted) across devices.</em></p>
<p>The 22nd of December was my last day leading the infrastructure team at <a href="https://posthog.com/">PostHog</a>. Going forwards, I’m starting a company and working full time on <a href="https://atuin.sh/">Atuin</a>.</p>
<blockquote data-callout="info">

<p>Atuin will continue to be open source and available for free in its current form as a self-hosted tool. By going full-time I hope I can focus on adding new premium hosted features for advanced users, and begin to support business usage.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="how-did-i-get-here">How did I get here?</h3>
<p>I started Atuin a few years ago now, to scratch an itch I had. I always felt that the shell should be easier to use, and that the state of shell history was the #1 problem there. I’d be googling commands that I knew I’d ran several times at some point in the past, or booting up my other laptop just to retrieve an incantation from earlier that week.</p>
<p>It turns out, a whole bunch of people felt the same.</p>
<p><a href="https://star-history.com/#atuinsh/atuin&amp;Date"><img src="https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=atuinsh/atuin&amp;type=Date" alt="Star History Chart"></a>
Some people even contributed - thank you so much to the more-than-150 people who’ve taken the time to make a PR, no matter how large or small. An extra special thank you to those of you who’ve stuck around a bit longer ❤️</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2023, I spoke at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyRmV19qJ2o">FOSDEM</a>. I had a <em>tonne</em> of fantastic feedback about the tool, both in person and online. This was great for my motivation - after a couple of years, I was starting to feel tired as an OSS maintainer.</p>
<p>I started putting more time and energy into the project, which paid off very well. Our usage grew massively - more contributors, more signups, more active community members, more features in blogs/podcasts/etc. We also moved the GitHub repo from <code>ellie/atuin</code>, to <code>atuinsh/atuin</code>.</p>
<p>I also had to make some improvements to the infrastructure, mostly because we store a lot of data (encrypted blobs don’t compress well…). While it is possible to self host Atuin, many people use the hosted sync server. Some metrics:</p>
<h4 id="user-growth">User growth</h4>
<p><img src="https://img.ellie.wtf/i/2b7564cc93397c096dcf0ce9f903c5ac06c337f16336b54ddffc4c82e58dd896.jpg" alt="User growth chart"></p>
<h4 id="history-growth">History growth</h4>
<p><img src="https://img.ellie.wtf/i/84fb1e13d7fa2e667822803b36fa5d6ab71c0f7ead9e66237ac116a278778371.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We started 2023 with users uploading (in total) around 10,000 lines of history a day. We ended it with users uploading almost 200,000 lines a day.</p>
<h3 id="a-balancing-act">A balancing act</h3>
<p>It turns out, the more you put in, the more you get out. While it was great to see growth in the project, it started to get away from me towards the end of the year. I’d work on Atuin before work, but more often than not I wouldn’t even get through the open PRs + issues. Let alone work on new features/fixes that were needed. Earlier in the year, my friend <a href="https://github.com/conradludgate">Conrad</a> had also stepped back from helping out maintaining, which was totally understandable.</p>
<p>I felt like I was letting the project down, neglecting my social life, and was trying very hard not to be distracted at work.</p>
<p>In order to grow the project how I’d like to, I needed to be able to dedicate more time to it than is fair while having a full time job.</p>
<p>So, I’m starting a company and working on Atuin full-time.</p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to run my own company, for pretty much my entire life. But I didn’t want to start something just for the sake of it. I want to build something people love, and find useful.</p>
<h3 id="money">Money</h3>
<p>I’d been paying out of pocket to run the Atuin servers the whole time. While not a huge amount, it also wasn’t tiny - 10s of millions of lines of encrypted shell history add up to a reasonably large amount of storage. Especially when you account for backups and moderate redundancy.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 2022, a friend suggested I setup GitHub sponsors. I didn’t think anything would come of it, but it did! After a few months I received enough sponsorship to cover the server bills, and to offset some of what I’d paid so far.</p>
<p>I really appreciate all of my sponsors for liking my work enough to contribute financially, when there’s no paywall or requirement whatsoever.</p>
<p>One thing I did notice though - I only really gained sponsors when I regularly mentioned that my sponsors account existed. Otherwise, I lost more to attrition than I gained. This sat weirdly with me, as it felt like begging.</p>
<p>Speaking privately with some other maintainers, this is not an uncommon experience. I definitely won’t be paying my rent with sponsors any time soon.</p>
<p>I read an <a href="https://codecodeship.com/blog/2023-04-14-mike-perham">interview with Mike Perham</a>, the creator of Sidekiq, that sat with me. I encourage you to check it out, but these two quotes stuck in my mind</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“in the end, OSS burnout will kill any free project which gets traction”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d certainly felt this. I don’t want the project to die, and I know just how great it can be with proper care and attention. But without change, I’d probably give up to spend more time on other projects or pursuits.</p>
<p>The second quote is one that I’d spend a good while thinking about</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you build something valuable, charge money for it”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="looking-forwards">Looking forwards</h3>
<p>My hope is that I can build valuable features that people wish to pay for, on top of what we already have. Partly advanced/power users, but especially for business use cases.</p>
<p>I’d love to grow Atuin to the point where I can pass it on, and sponsor the people and projects that we depend on.</p>
<p>I’m going to wrap up there, but if you have any thoughts please do get in touch! I’d love to hear your thoughts on where Atuin should go next.</p>

<p>If you or your company would like to provide support, please check out the <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/atuinsh">Atuin GitHub sponsors</a>!</p>
<p>Depending on the tier, I’ll mail out stickers and t-shirts to supporters - there’s also some tiers for companies that wish to show their support publicly, and receive a link back to their site.</p>

In fact, authentication, easy opt-out, and spam monitoring have been high on the list of <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/blog/email/understanding-email-deliverability/" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">email deliverability best practices</a> for quite some time now.</p><p>And while it’s no surprise it has caused some concern among senders, at Sinch Mailgun we suspect requirements like these will soon spread across the industry.</p><p>The most straight forward answer to this question is that, if you haven’t already, you’ll need to get serious about certain email deliverability best practices.</p><p>Both Gmail and Yahoo have highlighted three key changes that senders will need to prioritize if they want to be seen as legitimate senders come 2024:</p><ol><li><p><b>Authenticate their email: </b>Senders will be required to verify their sender identities with standard protocols like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.</p></li><li><p><b>Enable easy unsubscription: </b>Senders will need to implement a single-click unsubscribe link within emails if they haven’t already, to allow recipients to easily opt out.</p></li><li><p><b>Only send emails users want: </b>Gmail and Yahoo are getting serious about spam monitoring and senders will need to ensure they’re keeping below a set spam rate threshold.</p></li></ol><p>These mandates will only affect bulk senders, defined by Google as senders with volumes of 5000 or more messages to Gmail addresses in one day. The announcements don’t specify that a sender must send 5000 messages <i>each</i> day, or within a certain time frame, though.

</tbody></table><pre>tl;dr

In 2024 the OpenWrt project turns 20 years! Let's celebrate this 
anniversary by launching our own first and fully upstream supported 
hardware design.

If the community likes the idea outlined below in greater details, we 
would like to start a vote.

---

The idea

It is not new. We first spoke about this during the OpenWrt Summits in 
2017 and also 2018. It became clear start of December 2023 while 
tinkering with Banana Pi style devices that they are already pretty 
close to what we wanted to achieve in ’17/‘18. Banana PIs have grown in 
popularity within the community. They boot using a self compiled Trusted 
Firmware-A (TF-A)and upstream U-Boot (thx MTK/Daniel) and some of the 
boards are already fully supported by the upstream Linux kernel. The 
only nonopen sourcecomponents are the 2.5 GbE PHYandWi-Fi firmware 
blobsrunning on separate cores that areindependent of the main SoC 
running Linuxand the DRAM calibration routines which are executed early 
during boot.

I contacted three project members (pepe2k, dangole, nbd) on December 6th 
to outline the overall idea. We went over several design proposals, At 
the beginning we focused on the most powerful (and expensive) 
configurations possible but finally ended up with something rather 
simple and above all,feasible. We would like to propose the following as 
our "first" community driven HW platform called "OpenWrt One/AP-24.XY".

Together with pepe2k (thx a lot) I discussed this for many hours and we 
worked out the following project proposal. Instead of going insane with 
specifications, we decided to include some nice features we believe all 
OpenWrt supported platforms should have (e.g. being almost 
unbrickablewith multiple recovery options, hassle-free system console 
access, on-board RTC with battery backup etc.).

This is our first design, so let's KiSS!


Hardwarespecifications:

* SOC: MediaTek MT7981B
* Wi-Fi: MediaTek MT7976C (2x2 2.4 GHz + 3x3/2x2 + zero-wait DFS 5Ghz)
* DRAM: 1 GiB DDR4
* Flash: 128 MiB SPI NAND+ 4 MiB SPI NOR
* Ethernet: 2x RJ45 (2.5 GbE + 1 GbE)
* USB (host): USB 2.0 (Type-A port)
* USB (device, console): Holtek HT42B534-2 UART to USB (USB-C port)
* Storage: M.2 2042 for NVMe SSD (PCIe gen 2 x1)
* Buttons: 2x (reset + user)
* Mechanical switch: 1x for boot selection (recovery, regular)
* LEDs: 2x (PWM driven), 2x ETH Led (GPIO driven)
* External hardware watchdog: EM Microelectronic EM6324 (GPIO driven)
* RTC: NXP PCF8563TS (I2C) with battery backup holder(CR1220)
* Power: USB-PD-12V on USB-C port (optional802.3at/afPoE via RT5040 module)
* Expansion slots: mikroBUS
* Certification: FCC/EC/RoHS compliance
* Case: PCB size is compatible to BPi-R4 and the case design can be re-used
* JTAG for main SOC: 10-pin 1.27 mm pitch (ARM JTAG/SWD)
* Antenna connectors: 3x MMCX for easy usage, assembly and durability
* Schematics: these will be publicly available (license TBD)
* GPL compliance: 3b. "Accompany it with a written offer ... to give any 
third party ... a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding 
source code"
* Price: aiming for below 100$


How will the device be distributed?

OpenWrt itself cannot handle this for a ton of reasons. This is why we 
spoke with the SFC early. The idea is that BPi will distribute the 
device using the already established channels and for every device sold 
a donation will be made to ourSFC earmarked fund for OpenWrt. This money 
can then be used to cover hosting expenses or maybe an OpenWrt summit.

SFC is committed to working with us in various ways on this project — 
including making sure OpenWrt'strademark is properly respected, that 
this router isabeautiful example of excellent GPL/LGPL compliance, 
andthatthis becomes a great promotional opportunity for our project and 
FOSS generally!


FAQ

* Why are there are 2 different flash chips?
- the idea is to make the device (almost!) unbrickable and very easy to 
recover
- NAND will hold the main loader (U-Boot) and the Linux image and will 
be the default boot device
- NOR will be write-protected by default (with WP jumper available on 
the board) and will hold a recovery bootloader (and other essential 
data, like Wi-Fi calibration)
- a dedicated boot select switch will allow changing between NOR and NAND

* What will the M.2 slot be used for?
- we will use M.2 with M-key for NVMe storage. There is a 
work-in-progress patch to make PCIe work inside the U-Boot bootloader. 
This will allow booting other Linux distributions such as Debian and 
Alpine directly from NVMe

* Why is there no USB 3.x host port on the device?
- the USB 3.x and PCIe buses are shared in the selected SoC silicon, 
hence only a single High-Speed USB port is available

* What is the purpose of the console USB-C port?
- Holtek UART to USB bridge with CDC-ACM support on USB-C makes the 
device ultra easy to communicate with. No extra hardware or drivers will 
be required. Android for example has CDC-ACM support enabled by default

* What MAC OUI will the device have?
- we plan to register an OUI block for OpenWrt which can also be used 
for other vendor extensions such as Wi-Fi beacon IEs

* What is the purpose of the mikroBUS connector?
- mikroBUS was chosen as we wanted to make the hardware extendable. 
There are dedicated pins for UART, SPI, I2C buses and RST/INT signals. 
The standard uses regular 2.54 mm pitch connectors (you can use 
available mikroBUS modules or just connect to it something else, with 
2.54 mm jumper cables)

 &nbsp;* Why have the RTC on board instead of a mikroBUS module?
 &nbsp;- we believe there are many things a Wi-Fi (or networking in general) 
device should have on-board by default. Always having a correct time on 
the device is crucial in many applications, like VPN, DNSSEC, …


Timeline of events leading up to this e-mail

Forgive us for the lack of public communication during the initial 
phase(which as you can see was short and quick). We wanted to ensure 
that this project is feasible before disclosing it to the community. It 
would be a real shame if we announced something that we later found out 
to not be feasible thus failing expectations raised within the community.

03.12 - initial idea
06.12 - ping pepe2k, dangole, nbd
07.12 - ping MediaTek and ask if this sounds doable
08.12 - ping jow, Hauke
08.12 - request for call with SFC, we want them involved as soon as possible
09.12 - MediaTek replies and says they can help
09.12 - ping apacar, ynezz, dwmm2, lynxis, rsalvaterra
12.12 - MediaTek spoke with Banana Pi, they also like the idea
18.12 - call with SFC (Hauke joined, we found no prior slot to talk)
20.12 - started writing the U-Boot PCIe driver, made recovery from USB 
and android fastboot recovery work.
... and then the end of year celebrations started and not much happened 
for 2 weeks.

<p><strong>But</strong> if you use Firebase’s registration feature to create a new user (you cannot register on their site), you get full privileges (read/write) to the Firebase DB.

<p><img alt="LINUX NETWORKING" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/linuxnetworking.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
Beyond the usual new wired/wireless network hardware support and the other routine churn in the big Linux networking subsystem, the Linux 6.8 kernel is bringing some key improvements to the core networking code that can yield up to a ~40% improvement for TCP performance when encountering many concurrent network connections.
</p><p>
First up, there's been an analysis and reorganization of core networking structures. This effort has been around optimizing cacheline consumption and adding safeguards to ensure future changes don't regress. In turn this optimizing of core networking structures is causing TCP performance with many concurrent connections to increase by as much as 40% or more!
</p><p>
Coco Li of Google <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20231129072756.3684495-1-lixiaoyan@google.com/">explained</a> of their cachline optimization effort to the networking code:
</p><blockquote>"Currently, variable-heavy structs in the networking stack is organized chronologically, logically and sometimes by cache line access.
<p>
This patch series attempts to reorganize the core networking stack variables to minimize cacheline consumption during the phase of data transfer. Specifically, we looked at the TCP/IP stack and the fast path definition in TCP."</p></blockquote>
<p>Their results are mighty impressive for being done to the core networking code:
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2024&amp;image=linux_68_network" alt="Networking performance optimization"></p>
<p>A hell of an improvement especially for the AMD EPYC servers. Kudos to those at Google continuing to push these very enticing low-level kernel optimizations.
</p><p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=2024&amp;image=epyc_network_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2024&amp;image=epyc_network_med" alt="AMD EPYC CPU with network switches"></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile new Ethernet driver hardware support in Linux 6.8 includes the Octeon CN10K devices, Broadcom 5760X P7, Qualcomm SM8550 SoC, and Texas Instrument DP83TG720S PHY. On the Bluetooth side is new driver support for the IMC Networks Bluetooth radio.

As we've seen recently with efforts to <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.7-Staging">drop old/obsolete network drivers</a>, several outdated WiFi drivers were removed for Linux 6.8. Newly-dropped Wifi support include Libertas 16-bit PCMCIA support, Atmel at76c50x drivers, HostAP ISA/PCMCIA style 802.11b driver, zd1201 802.11b USB dongles, Orinoco ISA/PCMCIA 802.11b driver, Aviator/Raytheon driver, Planet WL3501 driver, and the RNDIS USB 802.11b driver.
</p><p>
When it comes to network driver improvements in Linux 6.8, the Intel high-speed NIC driver has added support for temperature and clock information reporting, among other random improvements throughout the many network drivers. NVIDIA Mellanox Ethernet data center switches can also now enjoy firmware updates without a reboot. On the WiFi side there remains ongoing WiFi 7 work and Extremely High Throughput (EHT) improvements.
</p><p>
The full list of new networking patches for the Linux 6.8 kernel merge window can be found via today's <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240109162323.427562-1-pabeni@redhat.com/">pull request</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="ember611083">    <h2>The Contract</h2>
<p>On March 13, 2023, I did something crazy:</p>
<p>I opened <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stickk.com/">StickK.com</a>, a site for making commitment contracts, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stickk.com/commitment/details/1009092?pid=0">placed a bet</a> that I would write a novel in 9 months and submit it to my literary agent by the end of the year. I told all of my friends about this contract and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ChanningAllen/status/1643958786057461763">discussed it publicly</a> many times, including to 100,000+ podcast listeners.</p>
<p>The stakes of the bet? If I failed, I would send $9,999, the maximum amount allowed by StickK, to a so-called "anti-charity" whose cause I didn't support.</p>
<p>Spoiler: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.loom.com/share/a6fe4ceb382f48c19e316cdbbb8dbcbc">I succeeded</a> with about an hour left in the year and zero gas left in the tank. I'd even found a free day to whip together <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ChanningAllen/status/1727415542456193087">an AI-based book trailer</a> after finishing the first draft.</p>
<p>But here's what you need to know: even though I was confident I would pull through on the contract, there was simply <em>no clear path to victory</em> at the time that I signed it:</p>
<ul>
<li>I hadn't written a word of fiction in almost 10 years.</li>
<li>I'm a <em>good</em> writer, but I've historically been a <em>slow</em> writer.</li>
<li>I run a business which requires a <em>lot</em> of my time, energy, and attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>How, then, was I so confident I would succeed?</p>
<h2>Plan, Do, Learn</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times." —Bruce Lee</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was confident because I've spent years mastering a simple iteration process — the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/plan-do-learn-my-somewhat-hardcore-work-routine-1fb500959f">plan, do, learn loop</a> — which helps me innovate and course-correct toward just about any goal, provided I'm given a reasonable time frame.</p>
<p>I encourage you to go read that old post if you haven't, but tl;dr:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I make a plan, then do the plan, then learn from my efforts by reviewing my progress. I do this every day of the year, going on half a decade now.</p>
<p>These plan, do, learn loops ("PDL loops" for short) exist at six nested levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quarters</strong></li>
<li><strong>Months</strong></li>
<li><strong>Weeks</strong></li>
<li><strong>Days</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sessions:</strong> multiple per day, lasting ~3 hours each and broken up by 60-minute breaks</li>
<li><strong>Actions:</strong> multiple per session, lasting anywhere from 5–60 minutes each</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If it sounds simple, it is. And it isn't. Throw a kick 10,000 times and you'll find lots of nuance.</p>
<p>My original post hinted at my iteration <em>speed</em> but said little about my iteration <em>strategy</em>. That is, I didn't explain <em>how</em> I plan, <em>how</em> I do, or <em>how</em> I learn.</p>
<p>Better late than never. In this post, I'll talk about 20% of the factors that lead to 80% of my outcomes. They're captured in the following acronyms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AIM</strong>: Plan</li>
<li><strong>FIRE</strong>: Do</li>
<li><strong>SCAN</strong>: Learn</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the concepts deserves its own standalone post, so I'm going to try to keep things short and sweet from here.</p>
<h2>AIM: The 80/20 of Good Planning</h2>
<p>AIM stands for ABZs, Interrogate, and Mandatory.</p>
<h3>1. <strong>ABZs</strong>:</h3>
<p>This gem is from <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ShaanVP">Shaan Puri</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Too many people get caught up in the HOW. "How do I go from A to B to C to D to E etc."</p>
<p>All you need is the ABZ:</p>
<p>A = where are you now<br>
B = next small step<br>
Z = end vision</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. <strong>Interrogate</strong>:</h3>
<p>Suppose you've already made an iteration through the loop and now you're reviewing your original plan. Rather than thoughtlessly continuing down that original path, interrogate the plan and confirm that it still makes sense.</p>
<p>At one point while writing my novel, I reflexively started working on a new chapter because I'd included it in the original outlining process. But interrogation helped me realize that it was no longer needed, which literally saved me weeks of wasted effort.</p>
<p>Heed Peter Drucker:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After completing the original top-priority task, the executive resets priorities rather than moving on to number two from the original list. He asks, “What must be done now?” This generally results in new and different priorities.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>3. <strong>Mandatory</strong>:</h3>
<p>Identify a mandatory, must-ship objective for the work iteration, and commit to shipping it regardless of the obstacles you encounter. If you can't think of a concrete objective, make it a time commitment like "contribute 5 on-task hours to my novel this week."</p>
<p>I've personally found it really effective to give myself a "day must-ship objective" and a "week must-ship objective." A few months into my StickK contract I even started taking out $50 "mini-contracts" to hold myself accountable to my week must-ship objectives.</p>
<h2>FIRE: The 80/20 of Good Doing</h2>
<p>FIRE stands for Frontload, Improvise, Resourcefulness, and Exhaust.</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Frontload</strong>:</h3>
<p>Mark Twain said it best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And If it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To repeat what I've <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ChanningAllen/status/1658145647223091205">written elsewhere</a>, long-term optimism for difficult projects is made out of short-term pessimism.</p>
<p>Wake up assuming everything will go wrong today. This week. This month. And execute accordingly.</p>
<p>If things do go wrong, you'll still be on track. If they don't, you'll be way ahead.</p>
<h3>2. <strong>Improvise</strong>:</h3>
<p>Speaking of things going wrong: they will. And when they do, you'll be happy you followed the ABZ framework and didn't overplan.</p>
<p>I use all sorts of techniques for improvising and getting unstuck. Here are just a few of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/the-bus-method-for-getting-unstuck-9c9f614b3d">The BUS method</a>: freewrite ideas, then organize them</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling">interstitial journaling</a>: journal as you work through tasks</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubberducking</a>: explain the problem you're trying to solve to an inanimate object</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: there's a huge difference between improvising on the iteration path and improvising on the iteration itself. Using the ABZ framework, a legitimate improvisation might be rethinking <em>how</em> to achieve B, but it will almost never be rethinking B itself. As a rule with few exceptions, you want to move forward through iteration loops, not backward. (Too often, moving backward is a sign of problems with doing, not problems with planning.)</p>
<h3>3. <strong>Resourcefulness</strong>:</h3>
<p>Human brains suck at most things. Instead of relying only on mental resources like willpower and memory, use <em>extra-mental</em> resources for added leverage.</p>
<p>This is a book-length topic and perhaps the main secret of my success, so forgive me the vagueness of simply bucketing extra-mental resources into two categories and leaving it at that for now: 1) The Three Me's and 2) The Two We's:</p>
<p>The Three Me's:</p>
<ol>
<li>Techniques, e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/the-bus-method-for-getting-unstuck-9c9f614b3d">the BUS method</a></li>
<li>Tools, e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/procedures-in-the-world-95d9c93a6f">standard operating procedures</a>, ChatGPT</li>
<li>Territories, i.e. environmental constraints on your behavior, e.g. putting your phone on DND mode</li>
</ol>
<p>The Two We's:</p>
<ol>
<li>Teachers, e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/i-read-60-books-every-year-ama-30d949cce4">books</a>, mentors, content creators</li>
<li>Teams, e.g. personal assistants</li>
</ol>
<h3>4. <strong>Exhaust</strong>:</h3>
<p>Don't take the "exhaust" term too literally here. Burnout is real, and I'm not suggesting you should do that. Instead I mean that if you decide to do an hour of work, try to work a <em>60-minute</em> hour rather than, say, a 30-minute hour filled with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_partial_attention">continuous partial attention</a>.</p>
<p>Easy to do when <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/are-your-projects-110s-80-20s-or-50-50s-7093388c0a">you're passionate</a> or things are going well. Less easy when you're stuck or bored, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/the-power-technique-a-strategic-approach-to-self-discipline-11bc6724d6">discipline is required</a>.</p>
<p>Enforced time constraints work wonders here. My own convention is to do intensive work sessions for set blocks of time then self-impose 30- to 60-minute cooldown periods where I relax and recharge. I use a website blocker called <a target="_blank" href="https://freedom.to/">Freedom</a> for this. I did a deep-dive on this process <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/artificial-scarcity-artificial-fatigue-4e6bd31061">here.</a></p>

<h2><strong>SCAN: The 80/20 of Good Learning</strong></h2>
<p>SCAN stands for Score, Critique, Adjust, and Notes.</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Score</strong>:</h3>
<p>Scoring helps you measure your performance objectively. If you don't do it, you end up lying to yourself without knowing you're lying to yourself.</p>
<p>Again, heed Drucker:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One company chairman was absolutely certain that he divided his time roughly into three parts. One third he thought he was spending with his senior men. One third he thought he spent with his important customers. And one third he thought was devoted to community activities.</p>
<p>The actual record of his activities over six weeks brought out clearly that he spent almost no time in any of these areas. These were the tasks on which he knew he should spend time — and therefore memory, obliging as usual, told him that these were the tasks on which he actually had spent his time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like to score (or at least track) two things: inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>By <em>inputs,</em> I really just mean time: "How many hours did I put in versus the amount of hours I was supposed to put in?" <em>Outputs</em> is more self-explanatory: "Did I ship my must-ship objective?"</p>
<p>Both can be scored with a simple 0 or 1. (My personal scoring systems have become a lot more sophisticated after years of iteration, but I started with something like this.)</p>
<h3>2. <strong>Critique</strong>:</h3>
<p>If you take the time to look, you will always, always, always identify at least one flaw in your performance that can improve upon. But if you don't look, that flaw will often go unnoticed for many iterations, or even forever.</p>
<p>What I do is identify at least one of these flaws at the end of each iteration cycle.</p>
<h3>3. <strong>Adjust</strong>:</h3>
<p>It's not enough to notice a flaw. You also want to take action. And in my experience, simply saying, "Okay, next time I won't do [flaw]" is bullshit 90% of the time.</p>
<p>One of my bad habits early on in the process of working on the novel was putting other work in front of it: answering work emails, chatting with my team, doing morning routine tasks, etc. By the time I got around to writing — which requires an enormous amount of mental energy — I was often drained.</p>
<p>So I made an adjustment: within 30 minutes of waking up, I needed to get started on the manuscript and knock out at least 2 hours of work before opening the pandora's box of digital distractions.</p>
<h3>4. <strong>Notes</strong>:</h3>
<p>Write down how things went during this iteration, and why. Benjamin Franklin began each day by asking himself in his journal: “What good shall I do this day?” Then, at the end of the day, he'd ask “What good have I done today?”</p>
<p>If it's good enough for Big Ben, it's good enough for you. The first reason why documenting your progress is good is because it leaves a record for you to investigate later. You'll be less likely to make the same mistakes over again without being able to lie to yourself about it.</p>
<p>The second reason why this is good is because writing is thinking. Often, the act of writing your learnings from the iteration will lead to far greater clarity about your performance than you could gain otherwise. It's similar to the process of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubberducking</a>.</p>

                      <h3>Researchers at Ocean Conservancy and University of Toronto estimate that American adults could be consuming up to 3.8 million microplastics per year from protein alone</h3>
          
          
        </div><div>
          
<p>Portland, Ore. – A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749123022352?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new study</a> led by researchers at Ocean Conservancy and the University of Toronto and published today in the journal <em>Environmental Pollution</em> found microplastic particles in 88% of protein food samples tested. The samples were drawn from 16 different protein types* destined for U.S. consumers, including seafood, pork, beef, chicken, tofu, and three different plant-based meat alternatives.</p>



<p>While scientists have long documented the presence of microplastics in the digestive tracts of commercial fish and shellfish like salmon, halibut and oysters, there has been little research into whether these microplastics are entering the filets of the fish – the parts that are actually eaten by people; and little research into terrestrial protein sources like beef and chicken that make up a large part of the American diet. In this study, microplastics were found in all 16 protein types tested, suggesting that humans are likely eating microplastics no matter the source of protein they choose. Furthermore, there were no statistical differences in microplastic concentrations between land- and ocean-sourced proteins.</p>



<p>“This is a startling reminder of just how prolific plastic pollution has become – humans live on land and yet seafood samples are just as likely to be contaminated with plastics as are terrestrial derived proteins,” said study co-author Dr. Britta Baechler, a marine biologist and Associate Director of Plastics Science at Ocean Conservancy. “And there’s no escaping them no matter what you eat, it seems. The plastic pollution crisis is impacting all of us, and we need to take action to address its many forms.”</p>



<p>The study found evidence that food processing is a likely source of microplastic contamination, as highly processed protein products (like fish sticks, chicken nuggets, tofu, and plant-based burgers, among others) contained significantly more microplastics per gram than minimally processed products (items like packaged wild Alaska pollock, raw chicken breast, and others). However, no statistical difference was found between high-processed products and fresh-caught products, suggesting that food processing is not the only source of microplastic contamination and opening avenues for further research.</p>



<p>“It’s tempting to want to draw conclusions like ‘eat less of this and more of that’ to avoid microplastics in your diet; but right now we still know very little about the microplastic burdens in commonly consumed foods. Our study adds to this knowledge but also demonstrates the need for further research to better understand the bigger picture, including where these microplastics are coming from and the potential human health risks<a>,</a>” said primary co-author Madeleine Milne, who conducted the research while at the Rochman Lab at the University of Toronto in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, across all samples, nearly half (44%) of the identified microplastics were fibers, which is consistent with other studies suggesting that fibers are the most prevalent form of microplastic in the environment. About a third of the microplastics (30%) were plastic fragments.</p>



<p>Using survey data from <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2023.1323477/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a separate study</a> by Ocean Conservancy and the University of Toronto (to be published in <em>Frontiers in Marine Science)</em> the authors estimate an American adult will consume, on average, 11,500 microplastics per year. Annual exposure could be as high as 3.8 million microplastics per year if calculated using the highest levels of microplastics found in each individual protein type and the average reported protein consumption rates.</p>



<p>“As ocean scientists, my co-authors and I are deeply concerned about the growing plastics crisis in the world’s ocean,” said Dr. George Leonard, Ocean Conservancy’s Chief Scientist and a co-author of the study. “But our study shows that plastics in our food goes well beyond fish and shellfish to a wide variety of other protein sources, as well.&nbsp; Our work is a call to action to reduce plastic pollution in its many forms to ensure a safe and healthy food supply for all consumers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>###</p>



<p>*Protein types included store-purchased breaded shrimp, minced pollock, fish sticks, white Gulf shrimp (headless/shell-on), Key West pink shrimp (headless/shell-on), Alaska Pollock fillets (skinless), chicken nuggets, top sirloin steaks, pork loin chops, chicken breasts, plant-based nuggets, plant-based fish sticks, plant-based ground beef, and tofu blocks.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1576">
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		




<div><p>This post is not going to be about what’s wrong with individual databases. There are so many databases and so many individual API issues, operational problems, and arbitrary limitations that it would be take forever to cover all of them. This post is about what’s wrong with databases as a collection. It’s about what’s wrong with databases as they exist today conceptually and have existed for decades.</p>
<p>Of course, something can only be wrong if there’s a different, better way to do things. There is, and we’ll get to that too.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="Global_mutable_state_is_harmful">Global mutable state is harmful</h2>



<div><p>Every programmer learns early on to minimize the use of state in global variables. They do have the occasional legitimate use, but as a general rule they lead to tangled code that’s difficult to reason about.</p>
<p>Databases are global mutable state too. They’re actually even worse than global variables since interactions are frequently spread across multiple systems, making it even harder to reason about. Also, they’re durable. So if a mistake is made that corrupts the database, that corruption doesn’t get fixed by just fixing the bug. You have to manually figure out what got corrupted and fix it. In a lot of cases it’s impossible to figure out exactly what got corrupted, and you may not have enough information to correct the corruption perfectly. Your best option in these cases is to either revert to a backup or merge in partial data from a backup, neither of which are optimal.</p>
<p>Most programmers simultaneously believe global mutable state in variables is harmful while also believing global mutable state in a database is fine, even though they share most of the same issues.</p>
<p>The better approach, as we’ll get to later in this post, is <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">event sourcing</a> plus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view">materialized views</a>. There are many ways to go about applying that pattern, and it’s important to do so in a way that doesn’t create other complexities or performance regressions.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="Data_models_are_restrictive">Data models are restrictive</h2>



<div><p>Databases revolve around a “data model”, like “key/value”, “document”, “relational”, “column-oriented”, or “graph”. A database’s data model is how it indexes data, and a database exposes an API oriented around the kinds of queries that data model can efficiently support.</p>
<p>No single data model can support all use cases. This is a major reason why so many different databases exist with differing data models. So it’s common for companies to use multiple databases in order to handle their varying use cases.</p>
<p>There’a a better abstraction for specifying indexes, and it’s one that every programmer is already familiar with: data structures. Every data model is actually just a particular combination of data structures. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key/value</strong>: map</li>
<li><strong>Document</strong>: map of maps</li>
<li><strong>Relational</strong>: map of maps, with secondary indexes being additional maps</li>
<li><strong>Column-oriented</strong>: Map of sorted maps</li>
</ul>
<p>Data structures can be of huge size by being durable on disk, just like data models. This includes nested data structures. Read and write operations on durable data structures can be just as efficient as the corresponding operations on data models. If you can specify your indexes in terms of the simpler primitive of data structures, then your datastore can express any data model. Additionally, it can express <strong>infinite</strong> more by composing data structures in different ways.</p>
<p>Because only a tiny percentage of the possible data models are available in databases (since each database implements just one particular data model) it’s incredibly common for a database to not match an application’s needs perfectly. It’s extremely expensive to build a new database from scratch, so programmers frequently twist their domain model to fit the available databases. This creates complexity at the very base of an application. If you could instead mold your datastore to fit your domain model, by specifying the “shape” (data structures) precisely, this complexity goes away.</p>
<p>Specifying indexes in terms of data structures rather than data models is a big part of the approach to backend development we’ll look at later in this post.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="Normalization_versus_denormalization_problem">Normalization versus denormalization problem</h2>



<div><p>Every programmer using relational databases eventually runs into the normalization versus denormalization problem. It’s desirable to store data as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Normal_forms">normalized</a> as possible to have a clear source of truth and eliminate any possibility of inconsistency. However, storing data normalized can increase the work to perform queries by requiring more joins. Oftentimes, that extra work is so much you’re forced to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormalization">denormalize</a> the database to improve performance.</p>
<p>Storing the same information multiple times creates the possibility of inconsistency if there’s a bug of any sort in processing. However, to meet performance constraints you’re forced to store the same information in multiple ways, whether in the same database or across multiple databases. And it’s not just RDBMS’s that have this problem. So the burden is on you, the engineer, to ensure complete fault-tolerance in achieving consistency for all code that updates those databases. Code like that is frequently spread across many services.</p>
<p>There’s a fundamental tension between being a source of truth versus being an indexed store that answers queries quickly. The traditional RDBMS architecture conflates these two concepts into the same datastore.</p>
<p>The solution is to treat these two concepts separately. One subsystem should be used for representing the source of truth, and another should be used for materializing any number of indexed stores off of that source of truth. If that second system is capable of recomputing indexes off of that source of truth, any bugs that introduce inconsistency can be corrected.</p>
<p>Once again, this is event sourcing plus materialized views. If those two systems are integrated, you don’t need to take any performance hit. More on this soon.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="Restrictive_schemas">Restrictive schemas</h2>



<div><p>Databases vary a ton regarding what kinds of values can be stored in them. Some only allow “blobs” (byte arrays), putting the burden of serializing and deserializing domain types on clients. Others allow a variety of types like integers, floating point numbers, strings, dates, and others.</p>
<p>It’s rare that you can store your domain representations in a first-class way in a database such that queries can reach inside your domain objects to fetch or aggregate information nested inside. Partially this is due to database implementation languages being distinct from application languages so they can’t interoperate in these ways. Sometimes you can extend a database to handle a language-neutral representation, like <a href="https://github.com/mpartel/postgres-protobuf">this extension</a> for Postgres, but it’s cumbersome and has limitations.</p>
<p>It’s common to instead use adapter libraries that map a domain representation to a database representation, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping">ORMs</a>. However, such an abstraction frequently leaks and causes issues. This has been discussed extensively already, like <a href="https://medium.com/building-the-system/dont-be-a-sucker-and-stop-using-orms-190add65add4">here</a> and <a href="https://dev.to/harshhhdev/why-orms-arent-always-a-great-idea-41kg">here</a>, so I don’t need to go into all the issues with ORMs again.</p>
<p>Being forced to index data in a way that’s different from your ideal domain representation is pure complexity. At the very least, you have to write adapter code to translate between the representations. Frequently, the limitations restrict what kinds of queries can be performed efficiently. The restrictiveness of database schemas forces you to twist your application to fit the database in undesirable ways.</p>
<p>This issue has been so universal for so long, it can be hard to recognize that this complexity is unnecessary. When you can mold your datastore to fit your application, including your desired domain representations, this complexity goes away.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="Complex deployments">Complex deployments</h2>



<div><p>Databases do not exist in isolation. A complete backend requires using many tools: databases, processing systems, monitoring tools, schedulers, and so on. Large-scale backends oftentimes require dozens of different tools.</p>
<p>Updating an application can be a complex orchestration process of migrations, code updates, and infrastructure changes. It’s not uncommon for companies to have entire teams dedicated to deployment engineering.</p>
<p>On top of all this, to be production-ready you have to ensure everything has sufficient telemetry so you’re able to detect and diagnose any issues that may arise, whether performance or otherwise. Every tool has its own bespoke mechanisms for collecting telemetry, so getting everything gathered together into one monitoring dashboard is another non-trivial engineering task.</p>
<p>The complexity and cost of deployment is an artifact of the development model which currently dominates software engineering, what I call the “a la carte model”. On the surface, the a la carte model is attractive: pick the most optimal tool for each part of your architecture and make them work together.</p>
<p>The reality of the a la carte model doesn’t meet that ideal. As the tools are designed independently from one another, “making them work together” is oftentimes a ton of work, including the pain of building deployments. And as already discussed, the tools are usually far from optimal. Things like fixed data models and restrictive schemas mean you’re frequently twisting your application to fit your tools rather than molding your tools to fit your application.</p>
<p>If you take a step back and think about what we do as software engineers, the high cost of building applications doesn’t really make sense. We work in a field of engineering based on abstraction, automation, and reuse. Yet it takes hundreds or thousands of person-years to build applications that you can describe in total detail within hours –&nbsp;look at the sizes of the engineering teams behind pretty much every large-scale application. Even many small-scale applications require engineering effort that seems severely disproportionate to their functionality. What happened to abstraction, automation, and reuse? Why isn’t the engineering involved in building an application just what’s unique about that application?</p>
<p>The a la carte model exists because the software industry has operated without a cohesive model for constructing end-to-end application backends. When you use tooling that is built under a truly cohesive model, the complexities of the a la carte model melt away, the opportunity for abstraction, automation, and reuse skyrockets, and the cost of software development drastically decreases.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="A_cohesive_model_for_building_application_backends">A cohesive model for building application backends</h2>



<div><p>To go beyond databases to find a better approach to software development, you have to start from first principles. That’s the only way to break free from the shackles of decades of inertia of software architectures. So let’s clearly and rigorously define what a backend is, and then reason from there as to how backends should be structured.</p>
<p>The primary functions of a backend are receiving new data and answering questions on that data. Answering a question may involve fetching one piece of data that had been previously recorded (e.g. “What is Alice’s current location?”), and other questions may involve aggregations of lots of data (e.g. “What is the average bank account balance of people in Freedonia over the last three months?”). The most general way to answer a question is to literally run a function on all the data the backend has ever received:</p>
</div>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br></p></td><td><p>query = function(all data)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<div><p>Forget for a moment the practicalities of this, that your dataset may be 10 petabytes in size and your queries need to be answered within milliseconds. What matters is this is a starting point from which to think about backend design. Unlike the data models of databases, this clearly encapsulates all possible backends. The closer your backend design is to this ideal while meeting the necessary practical constraints (e.g. latency, scalability, consistency, fault-tolerance), the more powerful it will be. How close can you get to this ideal? In other words, what is the smallest set of tradeoffs necessary to arrive at a practical system?</p>
<p>It turns out all you have to do is add the concept of an index, a precomputed view of your data that enables certain queries to be resolved quickly. And so the above model becomes:</p>
</div>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br></p></td><td><p>indexes = function(data)<br>
query = function(indexes)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>Every backend that’s ever been built has been an instance of this model, though not formulated explicitly like this. Usually different tools are used for the different components of this model: data,

<code>function(data)</code>

, indexes, and

<code>function(indexes)</code>

. In a typical RDBMS backend, an RDBMS is used for both data and indexes, with possibly other databases like ElasticSearch used for more indexing. Computation (both

<code>function(data)</code>

and

<code>function(indexes)</code>

) is usually done either as part of an API server’s handlers or in background jobs managed with queues and workers.</p>
<p>Larger scale backends may use NoSQL databases like Cassandra, MongoDB, or Neo4j for indexing, Kafka for incoming data, and computation systems like Hadoop, Storm, or Kafka Streams for

<code>function(data)</code>

.</p>
<p>In all these cases backends are constructed with a hodgepodge of narrow tooling. None of these are general purpose tools for any of the components of backends (data,

<code>function(data)</code>

, indexes,

<code>function(indexes)</code>

), able to satisfy the needs of that component for all backends at all scales for all performance requirements.</p>



<div><p>What this model does is provide a framework for a next-generation tool that takes all the needs of a backend into account. If a tool could implement all these components in an integrated and general purpose way –&nbsp;at any scale, fault-tolerant, and with optimal performance –&nbsp;the complexities described earlier in this post could be avoided.</p>
<p>That brings us to <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/index.html">Rama</a>, a backend development platform designed with these first principles at its foundation.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="Rama">Rama</h2>



<div><p>We announced Rama on August 15th with the tagline “the 100x development platform”. Since that sounds so impossible on the face of it, we paired our announcement with a <a href="https://blog.redplanetlabs.com/2023/08/15/how-we-reduced-the-cost-of-building-twitter-at-twitter-scale-by-100x/">direct demonstration</a> of that cost reduction. We re-implemented <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> (basically the same as the Twitter consumer product) in its entirety from scratch to be able to run at Twitter-scale. To demonstrate its scale, we operated the instance with 100M bots posting 3,500 times per second at 403 average fanout. Twitter wrote 1M lines of code and spent ~200 person-years building the equivalent (just the consumer product), and we did it with Rama with 10k lines of code and nine person-months. Our implementation is <a href="https://github.com/redplanetlabs/twitter-scale-mastodon">open-source</a>, complete, high-performance, and production-ready.</p>
<p>Twitter’s implementation was so much more expensive because of the complexities described earlier. For instance, to reach scale they had to build multiple specialized databases from scratch (e.g. social graph database, in-memory timeline database) because there were no databases that had the right data models. They have an extremely complex deployment consisting of a large number of different tools, with <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2017/the-infrastructure-behind-twitter-scale">over 1M lines</a> of just Puppet configuration.</p>
<p>These complexities and many others are completely avoided by our Rama-based implementation. Our solutions to the performance and scalability challenges of Twitter are similar (e.g. keep timelines in memory and reconstruct on read if lost, how we balance processing of an unbalanced social graph), but we were able to do it by simply composing the primitives of Rama together in different ways rather than build specialized infrastructure from scratch for each subproblem. Our <a href="https://blog.redplanetlabs.com/2023/08/15/how-we-reduced-the-cost-of-building-twitter-at-twitter-scale-by-100x/#Performance_and_scalability">performance numbers</a> for our Mastodon implementation are as good or better than Twitter’s numbers.</p>
<p>This is the programming model of Rama:</p>

<p>These concepts correspond directly to the first principles described. What makes Rama so powerful is how it implements each piece so generally. Depots correspond to “data” and are distributed logs containing arbitrary data. “PStates” (short for “partitioned state”) correspond to indexes. You can make as many PStates as you need with each specified as an arbitrary combination of durable data structures. ETLs and queries are

<code>function(data)</code>

and

<code>function(indexes)</code>

respectively, and they’re expressed using a Turing-complete dataflow API that seamlessly distributes computation. Being Turing-complete is critical to be able to support arbitrary ETL and query logic.</p>



<div><p>How to use Rama is documented extensively <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/index.html">on our website</a>. That documentation contains a six-part tutorial that does a much better job introducing the API than I could possibly squeeze into this post. That tutorial explores Rama through the Java API, but Rama also has <a href="https://blog.redplanetlabs.com/2023/10/11/introducing-ramas-clojure-api/">a Clojure API</a>.</p>
<p>So let’s instead look at how Rama avoids the complexities that have plagued databases for so long. While Rama does everything a database does, like durably indexing data and <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/replication.html">replicating changes incrementally</a>, it also does so much more. Rama handling both computation and storage is a big part of how it’s able to avoid these complexities.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the first complexity we looked at, databases being global mutable state suffering from the same issues as global mutable state in regular programs. Rama’s PStates serve the same role that a database does, but they are only writable from the ETL topology that owns them. Since every write to a PState is in the same ETL code, it’s much easier to reason about their state.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, PStates are materialized views over an event sourced log. So it doesn’t make sense for anything but the owning ETL topology to write to them. The combination of event sourcing and materialized views also addresses the other issue discussed earlier, that a bug deployed to production can corrupt a database in a way that’s difficult or impossible to fully correct. In Rama, a PState can always be recomputed from the depot data, which is the source of truth. This can completely correct any sort of human error.</p>
<p>The next complexity of databases was the restrictiveness of data models. We discussed how data structures are a much better way to specify indexes, and that each data model is just a particular combination of data structures. Being able to specify indexes in terms of data structures allows not just every existing data model to be supported, but also infinite more.</p>
<p>Rama’s PStates are specified as data structures. When developing Rama applications it’s common to materialize many PStates to handle all the different use cases of an application. For example, our Mastodon implementation has 33 PStates with a wide variety of data structures just for profiles, statuses, and timelines. Sometimes one PState handles 10 different use cases, and other times a PState exists just to support one use case.</p>
<p>PStates are durable, partitioned, and incrementally replicated. Incremental replication means there’s always another partition ready to take over if the leader partition fails, and it guarantees anything visible on a current leader will still be visible on subsequent leaders. These properties make PStates suitable for any use case handled by databases, including large scale ones.</p>
<p>The next complexity we covered was the normalization versus denormalization problem. Through being based on first principles, Rama inherently solves that by explicitly distinguishing between data (depots) and views (PStates).</p>
<p>The next complexity was the restrictive schemas of databases. One of the joys of developing with Rama is using your domain representations in every context, whether appending to a depot, reading/writing to PStates, or doing distributed processing in ETLs or queries. Any data representation is allowed, whether plain data structures like hash maps or lists, <a href="https://protobuf.dev/">Protocol Buffers</a>, or nested object definitions. There’s no difference between using any of them. If you want to use a type Rama doesn’t already know about, you just have to register a <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/serialization.html">custom serializer</a>.</p>
<p>The last complexity we discussed was complex deployments, and Rama addresses that too. Rama is an integrated platform capable of building an entire backend end-to-end. Rama applications are called “modules”, and a module contains any number of depots, ETLs, PStates, and query topologies. Rama provides built-in mechanisms to deploy, update, and scale modules. Each of these is <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/operating-rama.html#_launching_modules">just a one-liner</a> at the terminal. All that complexity of deployment engineering when dealing with traditional architectures comprising dozens of pieces of infrastructure completely evaporates from Rama being an integrated system.</p>
<p>Some people get the wrong impression that Rama is an “all or nothing” tool, but in reality Rama is <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/integrating.html">very easy to integrate</a> with any other system. This allows Rama to be incrementally introduced into existing architectures.</p>
<p>Another great consequence of Rama being such a cohesive and integrated platform is the monitoring Rama provides out of the box. Since Rama is so general purpose, it’s capable of monitoring itself: collecting monitoring data, processing it, indexing it, and visualizing it. Rama provides <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/operating-rama.html#_cluster_ui">deep and detailed telemetry</a> on all aspects of a module. This telemetry is invaluable for understanding the performance of a module in production, detecting and diagnosing issues, and knowing when to scale.</p>
<p>That covers all the complexities about databases discussed earlier, and we’re just barely scratching the surface on Rama. The best ways to learn more about Rama are to go through <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/index.html">the documentation</a>, play with the <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/downloads-maven-local-dev.html">publicly available build of Rama</a>, study the short, self-contained, thoroughly commented examples in <a href="https://github.com/redplanetlabs/rama-demo-gallery">rama-demo-gallery</a>, or study our <a href="https://github.com/redplanetlabs/twitter-scale-mastodon">Twitter-scale Mastodon implementation</a>.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<div><p>The software industry has been stuck near a local maximum for a long time with the a la carte model. The current state of databases is a consequence of backend development not being approached in a holistic manner.</p>
<p>Rama is a paradigm shift that breaks free of this local maximum. The complexities of databases that every programmer has gotten so used to are no longer necessary. The benefits of breaking out of that local maximum are very consequential, with a dramatically lower cost of development and maintenance. The 100x cost reduction we demonstrated with our Mastodon example translates to any other large-scale application. Small to medium scale applications won’t have as extreme a cost reduction, but the reduction in complexity is significant for smaller scale applications as well.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’d like to use Rama in production to build new features, scale your existing systems, or simplify your infrastructure, you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfrhmBwI0YAeaL8u4XmgfscW4UIUUDp2ZHSs4KmPH_TaDt1QQ/viewform">apply to our private beta</a>. We’re working closely with each private beta user to not only help them learn Rama, but also actively helping code, optimize, and test.</p>

        <p>It is one of the most bizarre looking aircraft ever to reach production. Its conception occurred in Australia, its gestation in New Zealand, and its growth and maturation back in Australia. This geography, and unfettered thinking about the TransAvia AirTruk’s mission, drove the airplane’s unusual appearance.</p>

<p>In the mid-1950s, the largely agricultural country of New Zealand found itself in need of new aircraft for “topdressing”—spreading soil enhancers and fertilizers by air—what we on this side of the world call “cropdusting.” The old airplanes they had inherited from the British Commonwealth, mostly converted de Havilland Tiger Moths and Piper Cub-like Austers, were wearing out. A few new American designs were imported, but currency restrictions of the day made them very expensive. New Zealanders needed a locally built airplane specifically designed for the job and sold for an affordable price.</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Jack Worthington and Snow Bennett, operators of New Zealand’s Northern Air Services, found a good starting place in the PL-7, built by Kingsford Smith Aviation Service near Sydney, Australia. The PL-7 was the brainchild of Italian aircraft designer Luigi Pellarini. Pellarini was not a man constrained by convention: His previous design, a flying car, was marketed in post-World War II Italy during a time when most Italians couldn’t afford so much as a motor scooter. It failed. (Not entirely his fault. Sixty-five years later, nobody has successfully marketed a flying car.) He sought greener pastures in Australia, where he was engaged to design an agricultural airplane. His solutions made practical sense, even if they didn’t look like anything that had flown before.</p>

<p>Pellarini reasoned that a topdressing aircraft—a cropduster—should carry as much payload as possible and still operate out of any patch of ground close to the worksite. He started with a large, steel, barrel-shaped tank and began adding. Attach points for a set of biplane wings and a tricycle landing gear were welded on. He figured that the rear fuselage—often corroded by chemicals in cropdusters—was there only to provide an attachment for the tail, so he dispensed with it altogether and hung two sets of tail surfaces on narrow booms projecting aft from the wings. This had the added benefit of allowing space for a loading truck to be backed between the tails where it could fill the hopper while the engine was running, keeping turnaround time to a minimum (agricultural airplanes don’t make money when they are on the ground). The pilot was perched on top of the aft end of the tank, giving him a clear view of the ground behind the lower wing. Racks beneath the lower wings could be used for additional payload, fuel, or to airdrop supplies without landing—a useful feature in a rough country where just delivering a bundle of fence posts could take a mounted man with a pack animal a full day.</p>

<p>The PL-7 was not a small airplane. The top wing spanned 41 feet and it weighed 5,000 pounds loaded, so it required a significant amount of power to do its job. The expedient solution for that challenge was the Armstrong Siddeley Cheetah, a British seven-cylinder, 400-horsepower radial engine. The Cheetah powered the Avro Anson, the most common multi-engine trainer in the British empire. Thousands of twin-engine Ansons were built, so Cheetahs were cheap and widely available.</p>

<p>The resulting prototype was hard on the eyes but performed well. Northern Air Services could not find the financing they needed to fully develop the airplane and advertised to sell the project, complete with the flying prototype and 200 Cheetah engines. Before they could find a buyer, however, the prototype was lost in a hangar fire in 1958.</p>

<p>Worthington and Bennett enticed Pellarini to New Zealand to design a new airplane based on the same ideas that had worked on the PL-7. To keep costs down, he used as many parts as he could from another military trainer, the North American Harvard (known to Americans as the T-6 or SNJ). The New Zealand air force was putting its fleet of Harvards up for bid, and Bennett Aircraft, based in Te Kuiti, New Zealand, bought 40 of them. A crew stripped off engines, wheels and brakes, control rods, and canopy components, all of which were to be incorporated into Pellarini’s PL-11, dubbed the Airtruck. Like the PL-7, the PL-11 was essentially a flying fertilizer tank, but this one was a monoplane. The cockpit was moved from the rear of the tank to high atop the front of it, almost above the 600-hp Pratt &amp; Whitney radial engine. The signature twin tail booms remained. The PL-11 was New Zealand’s first natively designed and built commercial airplane, but it proved difficult to get government officials to approve it for production. Although the first Airtruck flew in 1960, three years elapsed before it was issued an airworthiness certificate.</p>

<p>The delay effectively killed the project. After two years of struggling with an intransigent bureaucracy, Pellarini left in disgust and returned to Australia. Bennett succeeded in building a second example in 1968, but by then the PL-11’s time had passed.</p>

<p>Pellarini’s next airplane was the Australian-built PL-12. It was similar to the PL-11, but this time there was no call to use parts from old military airplanes. Splitting the difference between the biplane PL-7 and the monoplane PL-11, the PL-12 was a sesquiplane, with a small lower wing mounting the main landing gear. An American flat-six Continental engine of 285-horsepower was fitted, lowering the thrust line to the point that the pilot, perched at the crest of the stubby fuselage, looked through the very top of the prop arc. Down in the depths of the fuselage, behind the hopper, a tiny cabin could be outfitted with a pair of seats so the airplane could ferry a complete working crew—pilot, loader driver, and helper—to remote strips. (It would have been a nasty trip. Australian Sam Richards remembers a short trip in the lower “cabin” as being very noisy and cramped. “As a bonus,” he says, “when the flaps come down for landing the only exit is blocked. You can’t see a thing so you’re left hoping the pilot gets it right and you’re not trapped in the wreckage.”)</p>

<p>The result was a sturdy workhorse that could lift its own empty weight over again, even with the small, economical engine. In 1965, the TransAvia Corporation formed to develop and produce the PL-12 “AirTruk” (spelling changed to avoid a conflict with the Bennett airplane). TransAvia tried to get Australian government support while they developed an aircraft construction industry that could compete in world markets. Demonstrator AirTruks flew to Southeast Asia, India, and Europe; and one was shipped to the United States.</p>

<p>Pilot reaction was positive, despite the decidedly weird appearance. Stephen Death’s first agricultural flying job was piloting an AirTruk for his father’s air spraying service in Albury, New South Wales. “My father Keith adopted AirTruks when they first appeared in 1967 and I started flying them in 1983, fresh from my agricultural rating,” Death remembers. “I quickly learnt that it was not a fast aircraft, especially with spray booms and a wind-driven pump attached. The dual outlet doors on the bottom gave a very good pattern when spreading superphosphate. They were slow in the climb and sluggish when they were heavy, but still gave great feedback to the pilot.</p>

<p>“I am sure that the forgiving nature of the AirTruk saved me during my early [agricultural] flying career. Our company still operates a pair of AirTruks, using them as backup aircraft for busy periods. Even after 4,000 hours in type, I still enjoy flying them, either for work or just for fun.”</p>

<p>But the airplane never became popular—although it became briefly famous when a heavily made-up example starred in 1985’s <em>Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</em>. In the end, neither government funding nor significant foreign sales developed. Proposals for air ambulance and armed, forward-air-control versions also came to naught. With increasing competition from American designs, AirTruk production ceased in 1988 after a 120-strong production run. Agricultural airplanes are flown hard and thus tend to have short lives, and today the AirTruk has almost vanished.</p>

<p>Almost. Besides the pair Death operates, rancher and vineyard owner Ian Bell owns another that he flies just for the pleasure of flying it.</p>

<p>“The AirTruk first attracted my attention when I was a young boy,” Bell says. “Our family farm had an airstrip we used for weed spraying and fertilizer applications. Among the many types of aircraft being used was the AirTruk. [It] took my eye because it was so different. Ten years ago I had the chance to buy a well-maintained example, and I have enjoyed flying and showing it ever since.”</p>

<p>The AirTruk has a few strange features, Bell explains, but flying it is not so different from conventional designs. “One of the biggest differences is the unique view from the cockpit. There is literally nothing in front of you. The pilot is above both the engine and the load, and is surrounded by a steel tube truss for maximum safety. In the air, control response, despite the unusual configuration, is entirely orthodox. Landings, with that rugged landing gear and unlimited visibility, are easy.”</p>

<p>Death’s airplanes are the last AirTruks spraying fertilizer, but the ugly duckling has found a new role: airshow performer. Along with fellow pilot Nick Wills, Death teams with Bell to perform as a three-ship airshow act. Bell has another AirTruk in Death’s shop undergoing restoration, so they hope to soon show off a four-ship diamond formation.</p>

<p>Today at age 50-plus, the AirTruk lives the life a lot of us could envy: a little work, a little play, and a lot of pleasure for those who use it for either purpose.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is, so far, the only article of mine that's been completely deleted from Wikipedia. I've salvaged a copy of it from <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/away?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.search.com%2Freference%2FNon-PC_compatible_x86_computers" rel="nofollow">Search.com</a>, since it's gone from the site's history now, and am putting it here until I decide what else to do with it.</p><p><a name="cutid1"></a><br><b><u>Non-PC compatible x86 computers</u></b></p><p>For much of the time that Microsoft operating systems have dominated business computing, it has been a given that all computers based on Intel x86 family CPUs were IBM PC Compatibles. This is not the case and never has been.</p><p><b>MS-DOS systems</b></p><p>From the earliest days of the PC market, there have been other MS-DOS systems which were not IBM PC-compatible, such as the Sirius Victor computers and some early models of Apricot Computers. These had 8088 or 8086 processors and ran their own versions of MS-DOS, but the memory layout, display controllers and other hardware were not identical to IBM's components and were located in different areas of memory. The companies had anticipated that by producing technically-superior designs which could run the popular MS-DOS operating system, they would be able to take advantage of the large library of MS-DOS applications software.</p><p>Aside from its low hardware specification, perhaps the biggest perceived "design flaw" of the IBM PC was the what is nowadays called Upper Memory Area - the location of the I/O area at the top of the memory map (from 640 KiB up to 1 MiB). Locating the I/O area at the bottom of the memory map instead made it possible and indeed simple to expand these machines' memories. More RAM just appeared at the top of the memory map, up to the 1 MiB addressable limit of the 8086 processor. Thus. machines such as the Victor could routinely take 800-900 KiB of RAM, considerably more than the PC's 640 KiB limit. Other improvements over the IBM PC design were high-density 1.2 MiB floppy drives as standard, integrated sound cards and monochrome graphics (comparable to the IBM PC's Hercules Graphics Card).</p><p>However, although this was, in theory, enough to guarantee commercial success, that is not in reality a commercial success because in its early versions, MS-DOS was very basic and provided only meager functionality to applications developers. So rather than using DOS' APIs to control the hardware, most software authors "hit the metal" and controlled the PC hardware by writing directly to peripherals' control registers and so on. This meant that most PC applications could not run on other, non-PC-compatible x86 machines.</p><p>This would have become irrelevant with the advent of Windows and especially Windows NT, as it provided extensive APIs to Windows applications and discouraged developers from accessing the hardware registers. However, the first version of Windows to be successful was Windows 3.0 in 1990, too late for the proprietary DOS machines, although some of the last non-PC-compatible Apricot systems did support their own special version of Windows 2.0 and therefore probably ran many of the Windows 2.0 applications.</p><p><b>Multiuser and network machines</b></p><p>There were even less PC-like 8086 systems, such as the Jarogate Sprite, a multiuser Concurrent CP/M machine which resembled a minicomputer, supporting only dumb terminals - it had no display controller or keyboard interface on the system unit. Another was the 3Com 3Server and later 3Server386, which were dedicated PC LAN servers, with support for neither displays and keyboards of their own nor even terminals - control, setup and administration was done remotely, over the network. These ran 3Com's DOS-based NOS, 3+Share, which contained its own internal multitasking system. Although the 3Server achieved some commercial success, it had a less successful companion product, a diskless dedicated LAN workstation: the 3Station.</p><p>The rise of the PC compatible and its huge software library, including a range of alternative operating systems, killed off these early systems, but later ones were to appear.</p><p><b>UNIX workstations</b></p><p>Intel's 80386 processor was the first to include memory management hardware and thus be capable of running a full UNIX operating system. Sun Microsystems exploited this with the release of the Sun386i, a 386-based UNIX workstation. Though based on a processor mainly used in PCs and featuring ISA expansion slots, this was nonetheless a workstation, not a PC. Storage was on SCSI devices, it accepted a Sun Type 4 keyboard and optical mouse and booted via Sun firmware into SunOS 4. The development codename of these machines was Roadrunner.</p><p>Even though is was natively running UNIX, Sun developed this machine with the possibility to break into the PC market in mind. The Sun386i generally included a PC emulator (emulating an 8086) that could run MS-DOS and so normal DOS applications. As it was just a UNIX task more than one instance of the emulator could be used, essentially resulting in a multi-tasking DOS system. performance was pretty good, but the 386i didn't achieve a big market success. Old UNIX customers preferred the Sun-3 line, because most commercial UNIX applications were not available on the Sun386i. New customers mainly interested in MS-DOS had no really use for UNIX and preferred a real PC which ran MS-DOS natively faster and cheaper. Sun dropped the 386i line quickly when their SPARC systems reached the market. A successor workstation based on the 80486 processor (codename Apache) made it to prototype stage and would have been named the Sun486i; under 200 were made.</p><p><b>Windows NT workstations</b></p><p>Microsoft's Windows NT operating system was originally intended to be a cross-platform offering and up to NT 4 it ran on systems powered by MIPS, DEC Alpha and later PowerPC processors from a variety of manufacturers. This was a spin-off of the unsuccessful Advanced Computing Environment initiative and its Advanced RISC Computing specification (ARCS).</p><p>Reportedly, a development version also ran on SPARC but this was never commercially released.</p><p>However, the continuing rise in power of x86 led to support for all non-Intel CPUs being dropped with the advent of Windows 2000, although for some time, Microsoft allegedly maintained the Alpha port internally to ensure that the code remained portable.</p><p>Another short-lived generation of dedicated NT workstations arrived in the mid-1990s in the form of the SGI Visual Workstations. Again, these run workstation firmware - in this case, ARCS - and have a totally un-PC-like arrangement of bus, display and so on, although it used an x86 processor. This is the first time the HAL in Windows NT helped to increase the success of the workstations, since most x86 applications can run on it, thanks to the HAL.</p><p><b>Apple Macintosh</b></p><p>On the 6th June 2005, at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference, Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced that future Macintosh computers would be based upon Intel processors instead of the company's previous line of PowerPC-based machines. The first to ship was the iMac, on January 10th, 2006. The transition is expected to be complete by the end of 2006.</p><p>The first development systems shipped to developers consist of a relatively standard Pentium 4 motherboard in a PowerMac G5 case -- complete with a normal PC BIOS ROM.</p><p>This had led many observers to conclude that this means that future Intel-based Macintosh systems will be generic PC compatibles, but this is not the case -- final shipping products replaced the traditional BIOS with the newer EFI standard. Apple's new computers are merely the latest in a long line of Intel-based computers which are not PCs.</p><p>See the Apple Intel transition article for more information.</p><p><b>Summary</b></p><p>A number of factors determine if a machine is a PC compatible or not. These include, but are not restricted to, an IBM-PC-compatible BIOS, a compatible set of I/O ports, an Upper Memory Area containing video ROM and RAM and so on; in general terms, the detailed arrangement of the memory map of the system, including its firmware, its interrupts, its I/O ports and other factors, plus an x86 microprocessor.</p><p>These factors do not include its expansion bus. Some machines may have no such bus and some may have completely incompatible ones - such as the IBM Personal System/2 machines. On the other hand, the existence of PC standard slots does not mean that a machine is PC-compatible. Many non-PC architectures feature or have used ISA slots, including the Commodore Amiga, the Sinclair QL-compatible Q40 and Q60 machines and the Peters Plus Sprinter; PCI has been used in PowerPC Apple Macintosh machines and Sun workstations and AGP in more recent Macs.</p><p>Although many of these machines have been relatively obscure or unsuccessful, the presence of an x86 processor and a PC-like expansion bus, and even the ability to run Microsoft operating systems, does not mean that a computer is a PC.</p><p><b>External links</b></p><p>    * <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/away?to=http%3A%2F%2Fsites.inka.de%2Fpcde%2Fcollection%2Fsun386i_250.html" rel="nofollow">Sun 386i/250 pictures and description</a><br>    * <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/away?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.machine-room.org%2Fcomputers%2F7297%2F" rel="nofollow">Sun 386i/150 technical information</a><br>    * <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/away?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.machine-room.org%2Fcomputers%2F7298%2F" rel="nofollow">Sun 386i/260 technical information</a><br>    * <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/away?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.computer-archiv.de%2Fcomp0775.htm" rel="nofollow">Some (inaccurate) information on the Jarogate Sprite</a> - in German</p></div></div>]]></description>

It auto-updates with pictures from a shared iCloud photo album:</span></p></article></div></article></div><p>It's a re-worked version of a gift that I gave to my girlfriend in October, except that one was in a smaller frame that fell apart pretty quickly:</p><p><img src="https://ben.page/posts/eink/IMG_9398%20Large.jpeg" alt="" title=""></p><p>I rebuilt hers to be more solid, and built one for my parents at the same time. Here's how I did it:</p><h2>The e-reader</h2><p>For this project I went with a Nook Simple Touch Reader. You can find them on eBay or Facebook Marketplace for $10-$30 used.</p><p><img src="https://ben.page/posts/eink/image.png" alt="" title=""></p><p>The reason to go with a Nook instead of a Kindle or another e-reader is that Nooks run Android under the hood. That means they're far easier to root and to run Android apps on.</p><p>For that part, I followed <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/02/turn-an-old-ereader-into-an-information-screen-nook-str/">this wonderful post by Terence Eden</a>. The process was quite straightforward; the only thing to note is that you'll need a microSD card.</p><p>After you get it running Android, as the post describes, you can run an ancient Android app called Electric Sign. This app allows you to put any website on the Nook's screen and have it refresh at a given interval, with a catch: the Nook doesn't support SSL. Therefore I had to set up a website that uses <code>http://</code> instead of <code>https://</code>, which is remarkably difficult in this day and age. (I had to set up a custom Nginx server, because you can't use something like Vercel.)</p><p>But once that part was done, I just had to put the website URL into the Electric Sign app on the Nook and I was all set!</p><h2>The frame</h2><p>I bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZQ9GQ95">this pack of 8x10 frames off Amazon</a>, but in general what I was looking for was a frame that was large but could hold a 5x7 picture with a matte. That's because the Nook's display was more or less 5x7, but I needed a big frame (8x10) to hold the sides and charging cable coming out the bottom.</p><p>I simply jammed the Nook into the frame and forced the latches on the back shut, with the cable sticking out the bottom. It surprisingly fits the Nook, albeit with some bulging in the back.</p><p>If you look closely, the black bezels at the top and bottom of the Nook would show through the 5x7 hole, so I added some white card stock to have them blend in a bit better.</p><h2>iCloud photo album</h2><p>I wanted to source the images from a shared iCloud photo album. That way, I could share the album with my parents, and they could add new photos that would show up on the frame right from their Photos app.</p><p>iCloud photo albums have no API. However, if you share an iCloud photo album to a public link, you can use the Developer Tools to inspect the API requests Apple is making to get the photos. If you replicate those requests, you too can load the photos from the shared iCloud album (as long as the album stays publicly shared).</p><p>Here's my <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> code that I used, for reference:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>$webstream </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Http</span><span>::</span><span>post</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>https://p01-sharedstreams.icloud.com/12345678/sharedstreams/webstream</span><span>'</span><span>, [</span></span>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I find most descriptions of WebAssembly to be uninspiring: if you
start with a phrase like “assembly-like language” or a “virtual machine”,
we have already lost the plot.  That’s not to say that these
descriptions are incorrect, but it’s like explaining what a dog is by
starting with its circulatory system.  You’re not wrong, but you should probably lead with the bark.</p><p>I have a different preferred starting point which is less descriptive
but more operational: <i>WebAssembly is a new fundamental abstraction
boundary</i>.  WebAssembly is a new way of dividing computing systems into
pieces and of composing systems from parts.</p><p>This all may sound high-falutin´, but it’s for real: this is the
actually interesting thing about Wasm.</p><h3>fundamental &amp; abstract</h3><p>It’s probably easiest to explain what I mean by example.  Consider the
Linux ABI: Linux doesn’t care what code it’s running; Linux just handles
system calls and schedules process time.  Programs that run against the
x86-64 Linux ABI don’t care whether they are in a container or a virtual
machine or “bare metal” or whether the processor is AMD or Intel or even a Mac M3 with Docker and Rosetta 2.  The Linux ABI interface is <i>fundamental</i> in the sense that
either side can implement any logic, subject to the restrictions of the
interface, and <i>abstract</i> in the sense that the universe of possible
behaviors has been simplified to a limited language, in this case that
of system calls.</p><p>Or take HTTP: when you visit <a href="https://wingolog.org/"><tt>wingolog.org</tt></a>,
you don’t have to know (but surely would be delighted to learn) that
it’s Scheme code that handles the request.  I don’t have to care if the
other side of the line is curl or Firefox or <a href="https://www.wolvic.com/en/">Wolvic</a>.  HTTP is such a
successful fundamental abstraction boundary that at this point it is the
default for network endpoints; whether you are a database or a golang
microservice, if you don’t know that you need a custom protocol, you use
HTTP.</p><p>Or, to rotate our metaphorical compound microscope to high-power
magnification, consider the SYS-V amd64 C ABI: almost every programming
language supports some form of <tt>extern C {}</tt> to <i>access</i> external
libraries, and the best language implementations can produce artifacts
that <i>implement</i> the C ABI as well.  The standard C ABI splits programs
into parts, and allows works from separate teams to be composed into a
whole.  Indeed, one litmus test of a fundamental abstraction boundary
is, could I reasonably define an interface and have an implementation of
it be in Scheme or OCaml or what-not: if the answer is yes, we are in
business.</p><p>It is in this sense that WebAssembly is a new fundamental abstraction
boundary.</p><p>WebAssembly shares many of the concrete characteristics of other
abstractions.  Like the Linux syscall interface, WebAssembly defines an
interface language in which programs rely on host capabilities to access
system features.  Like the C ABI, calling into WebAssembly code has a
predictable low cost.  Like HTTP, you can arrange for WebAssembly code
to have no shared state with its host, by construction.</p><p>But WebAssembly is a new point in this space.  Unlike the Linux ABI,
there is no fixed set of syscalls: WebAssembly imports are named, typed,
and without pre-defined meaning, more like the C ABI.  Unlike the C ABI,
WebAssembly modules have only the shared state that they are given;
neither side has a license to access all of the memory in the “process”.
And unlike HTTP, WebAssembly modules are “in the room” with their hosts:
close enough that hosts can allow themselves the luxury of synchronous
function calls, and to allow WebAssembly modules to synchronously call
back into their hosts.</p><h3>applied teleology</h3><p>At this point, you are probably nodding along, but also asking yourself,
<i>what is it for</i>?  If you arrive at this question from the “WebAssembly
is a virtual machine” perspective, I don’t think you’re well-equipped to
answer.  But starting as we did by the interface, I think we are better
positioned to appreciate how WebAssembly fits into the computing
landscape: the narrative is generative, in that you can explore
potential niches by identifying existing abstraction boundaries.</p><p>Again, let’s take a few examples.  Say you ship some “smart cities” IoT
device, consisting of a microcontroller that runs some non-Linux
operating system.  The system doesn’t have an MMU, so you don’t have
hardware memory protections, but you would like to be able to enforce
some invariants on the software that this device runs; and you would
also like to be able to update that software over the air.  WebAssembly
is getting used in these environments; I wish I had a list of
deployments at hand, but perhaps we can at least take <a href="https://thenewstack.io/why-webassembly-is-perfect-for-tiny-iot-devices/">this article last
year from a WebAssembly IoT
vendor</a>
as proof of commercial interest.</p><p>Or, say you run a function-as-a-service cloud, meaning that you run
customer code in response to individual API requests.  You need to limit
the allowable set of behaviors from the guest code, so you choose some
abstraction boundary.  You could use virtual machines, but that would be
quite expensive in terms of memory.  You could use containers, but you
would like more control over the guest code.  You could have these
functions written in JavaScript, but that means that your abstraction is
no longer fundamental; you limit your applicability.  WebAssembly fills
an interesting niche here, and there are a number of products in this
space, for example <a href="https://docs.fastly.com/products/compute">Fastly
Compute</a> or <a href="https://www.fermyon.com/spin">Fermyon
Spin</a>.</p><p>Or to go smaller, consider extensible software, like the <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP image
editor</a> or <a href="https://vscodium.com/">VS Code</a>:  in
the past you would use loadable plug-in modules via the C ABI, which can
be quite gnarly, or you lean into a particular scripting language, which
can be slow, inexpressive, and limit the set of developers that can
write extensions.  It’s not a silver bullet, but WebAssembly can have a
role here.  For example, the
<a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz">Harfbuzz</a> text shaping library
supports <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/blob/main/docs/wasm-shaper.md">fonts with an embedded (em-behdad?) WebAssembly
extension</a>
to control how strings of characters are mapped to positioned glyphs.</p><h3>aside: what boundaries do</h3><p>They say that good fences make good neighbors, and though I am not quite
sure it is true—since my neighbor put up a fence a few months ago, our
kids don’t play together any more—boundaries certainly facilitate
separation of functionality.  <a href="https://www.wingolog.org/archives/2015/11/09/embracing-conways-law">Conway’s
law</a>
is sometimes applied as a descriptive observation—ha-ha, isn’t that
funny, they just shipped their org chart—but this again misses the
point, in that boundaries facilitate separation, but also composition:
if I know that I can fearlessly allow a font to run code because I have
an appropriate abstraction boundary between host application and
extension, I have gained in power.  I no longer need to be responsible
for every part of the product, and my software can scale up to solve
harder problems by composing work from multiple teams.</p><p>There is little point in using WebAssembly if you control both sides of
a boundary, just as (unless you have chickens) there is little point in
putting up a fence that runs through the middle of your garden.  But
where you <i>want</i> to compose work from separate teams, the boundaries
imposed by WebAssembly can be a useful tool.</p><h3>narrative generation</h3><p>WebAssembly is enjoying a tail-wind of hype, so I think it’s fair to say
that wherever you find a fundamental abstraction boundary, someone is
going to try to implement it with WebAssembly.</p><p>Again, some examples: back in 2022 I <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2022/09/01/new-month-new-brainworm">speculated that someone would
“compile” Docker containers to WebAssembly
modules</a>,
and now <a href="https://github.com/ktock/container2wasm">that is a thing</a>.</p><p>I think at some point someone will attempt to replace
<a href="https://ebpf.io/">eBPF</a> with Wasm in the Linux kernel; eBPF is just not
as good a language as Wasm, and the toolchains that produce it are
worse.  eBPF has clunky calling-conventions about what registers are
saved and spilled at call sites, a decision that can be made more
efficiently for the program and architecture at hand when
register-allocating WebAssembly locals.  (Sometimes people lean on the
provably-terminating aspect of eBPF as its virtue, but that could apply
just as well to Wasm if you prohibit the <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/exec/instructions.html#exec-loop"><tt>loop</tt>
opcode</a>
(and the tail-call instructions) at verification-time.)  And why don’t
people write whole device drivers in eBPF?  Or rather, targetting eBPF
from C or what-have-you.  It’s because eBPF is just not good enough.
WebAssembly is, though!  Anyway I think Linux people are too
chauvinistic to pick this idea up but I bet Microsoft could do it.</p><p>I was thinking today, you know, it actually makes sense to run a
WebAssembly operating system, one which runs WebAssembly binaries.  If
the operating system includes the Wasm run-time, it can interpose itself
at syscall boundaries, sometimes allowing it to avoid context switches.
You could start with something like the Linux ABI, perhaps via
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03858">WALI</a>, but for a subset of guest
processes that conform to particular conventions, you could build
purpose-built composition that can allocate multiple WebAssembly modules
to a single process, eliding inter-process context switches and data copies for
streaming computations.  Or, focussing on more restricted use-cases, you
could make a microkernel; googling around I found <a href="https://medium.com/@r1ru/wasmos-a-proof-of-concept-microkernel-that-runs-webassembly-natively-850043cad121">this article from a
couple days ago where someone is giving this a
go</a>.</p><h3>wwwhat about the wwweb</h3><p>But let’s go back to the web, where you are reading this.  In one sense, WebAssembly is a massive
web success, being deployed to literally billions of user agents.  In
another, it is marginal: people do not write web front-ends in
WebAssembly.  Partly this is because the kind of abstraction supported
by linear-memory WebAssembly 1.0 isn’t a good match for the
garbage-collected DOM API exposed by web browsers.  As a corrolary,
languages that are most happy targetting this linear-memory model (C,
Rust, and so on) aren’t good for writing DOM applications either.
WebAssembly is used in auxiliary modules where you want to run legacy
C++ code on user devices, or to speed up a hot leaf function, but isn’t
a huge success.</p><p>This will change with the recent addition of managed data types to
WebAssembly, but not necessarily in the way that you might think.  Like,
now that it will be cheaper and more natural to pass data back and forth
with JavaScript, are we likely to see Wasm/GC progressively occupying
more space in web applications?  For me, I doubt that <i>progressive</i> is
the word.  In the same way that you wouldn’t run a fence through the
middle of your front lawn, you wouldn’t want to divide your front-end
team into JavaScript and WebAssembly sub-teams.  Instead I think that we
will see more phase transitions, in which whole web applications switch
from JavaScript to Wasm/GC, compiled from Dart or Elm or what have you.  The natural fundamental abstraction boundary
in a web browser is between the user agent and the site’s code, not
within the site’s code itself.</p><h3>conclusion</h3><p>So, friends, if you are talking to a compiler engineer, by all means:
keep describing WebAssembly as an virtual machine.  It will keep them
interested.  But for everyone else, the value of WebAssembly is what it
does, which is to be a different way of breaking a system into pieces.
Armed with this observation, we can look at current WebAssembly uses to
understand the nature of those boundaries, and to look at new boundaries
to see if WebAssembly can have a niche there.  Happy hacking, and may
your components always compose!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>While <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a> is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/12/13/apple-alternative-app-stores-iphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making behind-the-scenes preparations</a> for allowing third-party app stores to comply with Europe’s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/antitrust/">antitrust</a> requirements, the company is continuing to make arguments about why it shouldn’t have to.</p>



<p>Latest among these is the suggestion that the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">App Store</a> shouldn’t be viewed as a ‘platform’ as the company actually operates five different app stores … </p>



<h2 id="h-a-quick-recap">A quick recap</h2>



<p>Antitrust regulators have long been eyeing Apple’s exclusive control over the sale of third-party iPhone apps. Whether you’re a consumer wanting to buy an iPhone app, or a developer wanting to sell one, there’s only one place you can do so: the App Store.</p>



<p>Apple has complete control over which apps it allows into the&nbsp;App Store, and the company sets its own terms – including its 15% or 30% commission – which developers and consumers alike have to accept. Many regulators, including the European Union, consider this a breach of competition law.</p>



<p>The Digital Markets Act (DMA) specifically states that the App Store is covered by the law. This means that&nbsp;<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/06/digital-markets-act-antitrust-law/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple must permit competition in the iPhone app market</a>, and it’s most likely that the only way the company can fully comply with this legislation is to allow competing app stores on the iPhone. The deadline for compliance is April of this year, and Apple has long been <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/12/13/apple-alternative-app-stores-iphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working on plans to meet this requirement</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-apple-says-it-has-five-different-app-stores">Apple says it has five different app stores</h2>



<p>The DMA applies to what are described as technology “platforms,” and the EU separately defines which company’s products and services fall within this term. Apple’s App Store is one of them.</p>



<p>Not so, said Apple, as the App Store isn’t a single entity. <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-disputes-eu-rules-labelling-its-5-app-stores-one-service-2024-01-08/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a></em> reports on the argument the iPhone maker yesterday made in a European court hearing.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The European Commission made “material factual errors, in concluding that the applicant’s five App Stores are a single core platform service,” Apple said in its plea to the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe’s second-highest.</p>



<p>The company in its argument to the EU competition enforcer said it operates five App Stores on iPhones, iPads, Mac computers, Apple TVs and Apple Watches, with each designed to distribute apps for a specific operating system and Apple device.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While iMessage has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/12/06/eus-imessage-antitrust-investigation-looks-set-to-rule-in-apples-favor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so far not been deemed a platform</a> – as <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/04/imessage-app-store-gatekeeper-not-big-enough/">it doesn’t have enough regular users</a> in Europe (WhatsApp is far more popular there, even among iPhone users) – Apple continues to make precautionary arguments against this changing in future.</p>



<p><em>Reuters’</em> summary makes it sound like Apple’s case here is rather sketchier!</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The company contends that iMessage [doesn’t fall within the scope of the DMA] as it is not a fee-based service and it does not monetise it via the sale of hardware devices nor via the processing of personal data.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-9to5mac-s-take">9to5Mac’s Take</h2>



<p>The plurality of app stores probably ultimately makes little difference, as the iPhone App Store would itself be large enough to quality as a platform. But Apple <em>may</em> succeed in arguing that its app stores for other devices should be excluded. (The Mac App Store should already be safe, as users are free to download and install apps direct from developers.)</p>



<p>The argument that Apple doesn’t monetize iMessage “via the sale of hardware devices” seems more of a stretch, since the company is <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/08/apple-imessage-android/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on record as knowing the power of iMessage to sell iPhones</a> and keep users locked into the Apple ecosystem.</p>



<p>The Cupertino company likely wants to throw as many arguments as possible onto the table, however, in case its usage numbers are questioned. Personally, I suspect <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/16/apple-rcs-coming-to-iphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its U-turn on RCS support</a> is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/17/apples-rcs-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">probably enough to protect it here</a>.</p>
