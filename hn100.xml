<p>We are in the third golden age of AI.</p>
<p>In the previous two golden ages (1950s-1960s and the 1980s),
our expectations outpaced the capabilities of the technology at the time, leading to disappointment.
In contrast, the AI technology of the current golden age, which began in the mid-2010s, has consistently exceeded our expectations.</p>
<p>Among AI technologies, the Transformer, introduced in 2017, stands as a groundbreaking breakthrough.
Initially developed as a machine translation model, its impact has extended to permeate nearly every field.
Today, the Transformer model is considered essential knowledge for modern engineers.</p>
<p>The first goal of this document is to provide the shortest path for engineers to understand the Transformer.</p>

The Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/12/openai-ai-safety-regulation-gpt4/?itid=lk_inline_manual_13" target="_blank">reported Friday</a> that OpenAI rushed out its latest AI model that fuels ChatGPT to meet a May release date set by company leaders, despite employee concerns that the company “failed” to live up to its own security testing protocol that it said would keep its AI safe from catastrophic harms, like teaching users to build bioweapons or helping hackers develop new kinds of cyberattacks. In a statement, OpenAI spokesperson Lindsey Held said the company “didn’t cut corners on our safety process, though we recognize the launch was stressful for our teams.”</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TH3SN445UVE7PC4L3TFGYHYC5U" data-el="text" dir="null">Tech companies’ strict confidentiality agreements have long vexed workers and regulators.

Regulators, meanwhile, have worried that the terms muzzle tech employees who could alert them to misconduct in the opaque<b> </b>tech sector, especially amid allegations that companies’ algorithms promote content that undermines elections, public health and children’s safety.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PBRT3ZCHC10B7ATVQ4TZ16V3MW" data-el="text" dir="null">The rapid advance of artificial intelligence sharpened<b> </b>policymakers’ concerns about the power of the tech industry, prompting a flood of calls for regulation. In the United States, AI companies are largely operating in a legal vacuum, and policymakers say they cannot effectively create new AI policies without the help of whistleblowers, who can help explain the potential threats posed by the fast-moving technology.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="1MJTVFK93N5C5ANZ20PUGG5TW8" data-el="text" dir="null">“OpenAI’s policies and practices appear to cast a chilling effect on whistleblowers’ right to speak up and receive due compensation for their protected disclosures,” said Sen.

Federal regulators should require OpenAI to notify all past and current employees of the violations the company committed as well as notify them that they have the right to confidentially and anonymously report any violations of law to the SEC. The SEC should issue fines to OpenAI for “each improper agreement” under SEC law and direct OpenAI to cure the “chilling effect” of its past practices, according to the whistleblowers letter.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T4GVHMFCIJBUZH4UKMEZ5GO34Y" data-el="text" dir="null">Multiple tech employees, including <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/26/frances-haugen-facebook-whistleblower-documents/?itid=lk_inline_manual_32" target="_blank">Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen</a>, have filed complaints with the SEC, which established a whistleblower program in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5GFZHILTJRHHNJUGOYTAWL5ZKE" data-el="text" dir="null">Fighting back against Silicon Valley’s use of NDAs to “monopolize information” has been a protracted battle, said Chris Baker, a San Francisco lawyer. He won a $27 million settlement for Google employees in December against claims that the tech giant used onerous confidentiality agreements to block whistleblowing and other protected activity. Now tech companies are increasingly fighting back with clever ways to deter speech, he said.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VQNXXU4DJ97DQ4N4YTY49QZ82C" data-el="text" dir="null">“Employers have learned that the cost of leaks is sometimes way greater than the cost of litigation, so they are willing to take the risk,” Baker said.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Peter Buxtun, the whistleblower who revealed that the US government allowed hundreds of Black men in rural <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alabama" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Alabama</a> to go untreated for syphilis in what became known as the Tuskegee study, has died. He was 86.</p><p>Buxtun died on 18 May of Alzheimer’s disease in Rocklin, California, according to his attorney, Minna Fernan.</p><p>Buxtun is revered as a hero to public health scholars and ethicists for his role in bringing to light the most notorious medical research scandal in US history. Documents that Buxtun provided to the Associated Press, and its subsequent investigation and reporting, led to a public outcry that ended the study in 1972.</p><p>Forty years earlier, in 1932, federal scientists began studying 400 Black men in Tuskegee, Alabama, who were infected with syphilis. When antibiotics became available in the 1940s that could treat the disease, federal health officials ordered that the drugs be withheld. The study became an observation of how the disease ravaged the body over time.</p><p>In the mid-1960s, Buxtun was a federal public health employee working in San Francisco when he overheard a co-worker talking about the study. The research was not exactly a secret – about a dozen medical journal articles about it had been published in the previous 20 years. But hardly anyone had raised any concerns about how the experiment was being conducted.</p><p>“This study was completely accepted by the American medical community,” said Ted Pestorius of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, speaking at a 2022 program marking the 50th anniversary of the end of the study.</p><p>Buxtun had a different reaction. After learning more about the study, he raised ethical concerns in a 1966 letter to officials at the CDC. In 1967, he was summoned to a meeting in Atlanta, where he was chewed out by agency officials for what they deemed to be impertinence. Repeatedly, agency leaders rejected his complaints and his call for the men in Tuskegee to be treated.</p><p>He left the US Public Health Service and attended law school, but the study ate at him. In 1972, he provided documents about the research to Edith Lederer, an AP reporter he had met in San Francisco. Lederer passed the documents to the AP investigative reporter Jean Heller, telling her colleague: “I think there might be something here.”</p><p>Heller’s story was published on 25 July 1972, leading to congressional hearings, a class-action lawsuit that resulted in a $10m settlement and the study’s termination about four months later. In 1997, President Bill Clinton formally apologized for the study, calling it “shameful”.</p><p>The leader of a group dedicated to the memory of the study participants said on Monday they were grateful to Buxtun for exposing the experiment.</p><p>“We are thankful for his honesty and his courage,” said Lille Tyson Head, whose father was in the study.</p><p>Buxtun was born in Prague in 1937. His father was Jewish, and his family immigrated to the US in 1939 from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, eventually settling in Irish Bend, Oregon, on the Columbia River.</p><p>In his complaints to federal health officials, he drew comparisons between the Tuskegee study and medical experiments Nazi doctors had conducted on Jews and other prisoners. Federal scientists did not believe they were guilty of the same kind of moral and ethical sins, but after the Tuskegee study was exposed, the government put in place new rules about how it conducts medical research. Today, the study is often blamed for the unwillingness of some African Americans to participate in medical research.</p><p>“Peter’s life experiences led him to immediately identify the study as morally indefensible and to seek justice in the form of treatment for the men. Ultimately, he could not relent,” said the CDC’s Pestorius.</p><p>Buxtun attended the University of Oregon, served in the US army as a combat medic and psychiatric social worker and joined the federal health service in 1965.</p><p>Buxtun went on to write, give presentations and win awards for his involvement in the Tuskegee study. A global traveler, he collected and sold antiques, especially military weapons and swords and gambling equipment from California’s gold rush era.</p><p>He also spent more than 20 years trying to recover his family’s properties confiscated by the Nazis and was partly successful.</p><p>“Peter was wise, witty, classy and unceasingly generous,” said David M Golden, a close friend of Buxtun’s for over 25 years. “He was a staunch advocate for personal freedoms and spoke often against prohibition, whether it be drugs, prostitution or firearms.”</p><p>Another longtime friend Angie Bailie said she attended many of Buxtun’s presentations about Tuskegee.</p><p>“Peter never ended a single talk without fighting back tears,” she said</p><p>Buxtun himself could be self-effacing about his actions, saying he did not anticipate the vitriolic reaction of some health officials when he started questioning the study’s ethics.</p><p>At a Johns Hopkins University forum in 2018, Buxtun was asked where he got the moral strength to blow the whistle.</p><p>“It wasn’t strength,” he said. “It was stupidity.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I bought a Surface Pro 4 at 2016. It has an Intel Core m3-6Y30 CPU and 4GB memory. The spec is not that impressive even compared to an average laptop released years earlier. On the other hand, the form factor is very attractive to me: at a very low price, you get a tablet with a beautiful HiDPI 2k screen, a pressure sensitive stylus and an useable keyboard. It is on the heavier side if used as a tablet, but compared to other laptops, it’s very light. It served me very well for my limited use cases. The blog <a href="https://www.binwang.me/2016-11-28-Config-Development-Environment-on-Windows.html">Build a Unix Like Environment on Windows</a> was written at that era. Some years later, I bought a more powerful laptop when I needed to work while traveling. So I gave the Surface away to a family member.</p>

<p>However, during the past years, I couldn’t stop thinking about having a Linux tablet. At first I checked <a href="https://pine64.org/devices/pinetab/">Pinetab</a>, then I realized I had a Surface which would be perfect if I could install Linux on it. I searched online and found some successful stories. So when I <a href="https://www.binwang.me/2024-03-19-Travel-Back-to-China.html">travelled back to my hometown</a> at the beginning of this year, I brought the Surface back with me and started to experiment with it.</p>

<h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>

<p>Before I go further, I need to mention my intended use cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Browse Internet. Mainly <a href="https://www.rssbrain.com/">RSS Brain</a>, the RSS reader I built by myself.</li>
  <li>Media consumption: watch videos from my Samba share and online websites like Youtube.</li>
  <li>PDF reading: reading only is enough for me but it’s better if I can take notes in the PDF.</li>
  <li>Sketches: I don’t have a habit to do handwriting notes even at students era. Nowadays it’s more efficient and readable/searchable to take text notes with Markdown. However, I do like drawing sketches on paper when brain storming or resolving some hard problem. Moving it to digital has a lot of benefits if it works.</li>
  <li>Drawing: this is a good to have feature. I don’t really have needs to draw things but it’s always fun. Especially with the development of AI, if I draw something and send it to a more powerful machine to generate images, it could open doors to many possibilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>The installation of Linux is actually very easy. I tried two distros and the installation process went very smooth for both of them. The distros I tried are <a href="https://endeavouros.com/">EndeavourOS</a> and Fedora workstation 40.</p>

<p>The installation steps are well documented in <a href="https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Installation-and-Setup#installation">linux-surface’s wiki</a>. <a href="https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface">linux-surface</a> is the Linux kernel and tools for Surface devices. The wiki page has its installation steps as well.</p>

<p>In general, if only used as a laptop, the experience is almost perfect even without the linux-surface kernel. But using it as a tablet is another story.</p>

<h2 id="what-works">What Works</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about what works first. Even without linux-surface kernel, almost everything works except touch screen and stylus. That includes things like wireless network, bluetooth, keyboard, power profile, UI scaling for Hi-DPI and so on. Multi touch and pressure sensitive stylus works as well (sort of, see sections below) after installed linux-surface kernel. Battery life is good enough: about 5-6 hours of light usage like web browsing, PDF reading, and about 3 hours of video watching. (Just some estimated time from my experience, no serious benchmarking was done).</p>

<p>On the software side, automatic screen rotation is enabled on both distros I tried. KDE with EndeavourOS is very fast and responsive. When the keyboard is detached, it enters tablet mode which makes some UI larger and more user friendly with touch gestures. For example, you can just touch on a folder to open it in Dolphin instead of double click it.</p>

<p>For Gnome, it’s less responsive than KDE but the UI is really beautiful when used as a tablet. I was never a fan after Gnome 3 but I guess the UI changes it made makes more sense on a tablet than on a laptop or a desktop. The overall layout really reminds you about the iPad or Android tablet (in a good way), but with the power of a real desktop OS at the same time. I would really like it if it uses less resource.</p>

<p>Even though the overall experience is positive and has the potential to meet all my use cases, one serious problem made it very unusable and made me gave up Linux on Surface at the end.</p>

<h2 id="the-problems-in-both-distros">The Problems in Both Distros</h2>

<p>The deal breaker problem is touch recognition. The problem is in the surface-linux tools so it affects all the distros. The biggest problem is ghost touch: touches are registered randomly even when I do nothing. I tried a lot of workarounds including the ones mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Surface-Pro-5">linux-surface’s wiki page</a>, but none of them actually resolved it completely. Sometimes it’s fixed after reboot but reappeared after next reboot. Sometimes it get fixed for a period of time but reappeared after a system upgrade. Sometimes the touch screen doesn’t work at all after resume from sleep. The randomness and the serious of the problem is really annoying so I gave up using it with Linux at last.</p>

<p>Other than the ghost touching, another big problem about touch recognition is palm rejection. It’s really annoying when draw things with the pen. In iptsd (surface-linux’s deamon for touch recognition), there is a configuration to disable touch screen when using a pen but it doesn’t work well. So it makes drawing very unusable.</p>

<p>Both KDE and Gnome has virtual keyboards when the physical keyboard is detached, and works most of the time despite the problems I’ll mention in the following sections. But if you have setup disk encryption with a password, there is no virtual keyboard when you input the disk password, so a physical keyboard is always needed during the boot. Which can be annoying but not really a deal breaker.</p>

<p>The last big problem is battery drain during sleep. It uses about 30% battery for one night even it has been put into sleep. I had similar issues for other laptops. I believe there maybe some configurations I can tune to fix that. But after I gave up Linux on it because of the ghost touch, I didn’t dig deeper into that.</p>

<p>Other than the problems shared by both distros, each distro/desktop environment also has their own problems.</p>

<h2 id="the-problems-in-kde-with-endeavouros">The Problems in KDE with EndeavourOS</h2>

<p>The biggest problem in KDE other than the ones I talked above, is the virtual keyboard. It’s buggy and not very stable. Sometimes it kept pop up and sometimes it doesn’t show up. It’s annoying especially at the login screen: if it’s not popped up you will still need a physical keyboard, which prevent it to be a real tablet. Sometimes when the keyboard is popped up, the panel at the bottom cannot be touched. The bugs happened randomly that makes it hard to be properly reported.</p>

<p>Another problem is the touch gesture for right click. Naturally, with a touch screen, long press should be treated like a right click. But that is not the case for KDE. So a lot of operations just cannot be done without a mouse when you need a right click.</p>

<p>Resize a window is also very tricky with touch only operation: you need to touch on the boarder precisely on the first try.</p>

<p>At last, the scroll behaviour is not very smooth. It makes me a little bit dizzy just by scrolling through web pages and PDFs.</p>

<p>So I thought give another distro and desktop environment a try, to see if they can resolve my problems.</p>

<h2 id="the-problems-in-gnome-with-fedora-workstation-40">The Problems in Gnome with Fedora Workstation 40</h2>

<p>I choose Fedora because it comes with Gnome, and I had good experience with it before. After the installation, the first impression is it’s much slower than KDE with EndeavourOS. I found it enables swap and ZRam by default so I disabled them. It’s better but still slower than KDE. It uses more memory at around 40-50% percentage while idel. And I got a lot of OOM kills which almost never happened with KDE on EndeavourOS.</p>

<p>Maybe because of the slowness, it’s also buggy for lots of operations. For example, when switch to the workspace view from PDF viewer with 4 fingers swipe up, the PDF keeps scrolling at the background. And when scroll in the file manager, the context menu keeps popping up.</p>

<p>Other than the slowness, there is a problem on the virtual keyboard as well: the backspace key doesn’t work properly. I found a workaround by install a third-party Gnome addon, but sometimes the old keyboard still popped up.</p>

<h2 id="go-back-to-windows-10">Go Back to Windows 10</h2>

<p>I’d say if the touch recognition works well enough, all the other problems are acceptable with KDE. But with those problems, I finally decided to fallback to Windows 10 again. It works well enough, just as I remembered from years ago. However I abandoned OneNotes and some other Microsoft products and use the following software instead:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Firefox as the browser.</li>
  <li>Nextcloud to sync the files.</li>
  <li>Samba for video sharing.</li>
  <li>Built in video player for local video playing.</li>
  <li>Krita for drawing and sketches.</li>
  <li>Drawboard PDF for PDF reading.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s pretty disappointing that this device cannot be used with Linux properly. But using Windows is still better to just let the device sitting there doing nothing. Maybe I will re-evaluate it after Windows 10 is end of life next year.</p>

										<p>A few weeks before the release of my first book, a memoir about my mother’s murder, I had to take a polygraph exam. The two things were not in fact related, but that was easy to forget once I found myself strapped in a chair in a windowless room on the fourth floor of a federal building in El Paso, with some polygrapher I’d just met sitting behind me, asking questions.</p><p><span>Article continues below</span></p>
<p>I’d met my examiner, whom I’ll call Kevin, that morning. The federal scheduler had insisted on a 9:00 am appointment even though I lived four hours away, which meant I’d spent the previous night alone in a Motel 6 by the highway in El Paso, eating Del Taco and reflecting on the decisions that had led me to spending the night alone in a Motel 6 by the highway in El Paso, eating Del Taco. Technically, I was there because I’d applied for a job with Customs and Border Protection. But the truth seemed much more complicated than that.</p>
<p>I didn’t get much sleep, and showed up at the federal building early, dressed in what I imagined the government meant by comfortable clothing: black dress pants, plain white oxford, no tie. I looked like a banquet waiter. One other guy was in the waiting room when I walked in. As we sat there past the scheduled time of our appointments, we struck up a desultory conversation. Like me, he’d been in the hiring process for years, had driven down from Albuquerque the night before, and seemed nervous. He asked if I’d done any research on the polygraph. I said no, and asked him the same question. He said no. We were getting our first lies out of the way.</p>
<p><span>The lie detector was like any true story in America: the facts didn’t matter as long as a lot of people believed it. </span></p><p>The government’s guidelines had repeatedly stressed that we should not do any research before our polygraph. Their insistence struck me as odd: if the machine detects lies, why would it matter? I’d spent much of the previous week Googling polygraphs. I was in the middle of denying it to my new friend when the door opened and Kevin appeared.</p>
<p>He was around sixty, short, portly, bald, with a silly goatee and wire-rimmed glasses, wearing a baggy gray suit and a shirt in one of those colors I never can keep straight, puce or mauve or periwinkle, a little too festive for the occasion. Kevin was squinty and smug, with an air of hollow authority that reminded me of my middle-school principal. He didn’t even step into the waiting room, just swung the door open and shouted my full name. I stood and shook the hand he extended. He squeezed too hard and said I could call him by his first name, as if he were doing me some great favor.</p>
<p>Kevin led me down a drab hallway to a door on the left that led to my first disappointment. I’d been expecting the sort of tableau you see in cop movies, some dank cellar with a dangling bulb and a two-way mirror on the wall for me to stare defiantly into. Instead we entered a bare, sterile room with office chairs on either side of a desk. Wires ran from the computer on the desk across the room to a hard-backed chair festooned with cuffs and straps and sensors.</p>
<p>We sat in the normal chairs. Kevin leaned back in his, twirled a pencil, and said, “Let’s get started.” I knew this bit, the casual tone and performative warmth. I was a college professor, sort of, and I did this same bit on the first day of classes, trying to make my students trust me. In that first fluorescent moment, staring into Kevin’s beady eyes, I had a premonition: I was going to fail my polygraph exam.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Joan Didion once wrote that it’s easy to see the beginnings of things, and harder to see the ends. That has not been my experience. Ends are obvious: divorce, death, getting fired. Beginnings, on the other hand, seem subjective. If ends are facts, beginnings are truth: relative, random, subject to belief.</p>
<p>The story of my exam, for example, could begin two years before I met Kevin, when President Obama signed an act requiring polygraph screening for applicants to certain federal agencies. Or two years before that, when I started writing a memoir and began to understand what it means to tell the truth. Or it could begin with the polygraph itself, the kind of story America likes best: a simple one that isn’t all that true. The polygraph’s most commonly credited inventor is John Larson, an employee of the Berkeley Police Department, who developed a new device for interrogations in 1921. Larson was twenty-nine at the time, and, like me, a strange candidate for law enforcement: he might have been America’s first cop with a PhD.</p>
<p>His degree was in physiology, the science of the body’s systems. The then-prevailing scientific belief saw crime as biological, either hereditary or the result of a physical defect. Larson explored both possibilities. His undergraduate work tried to find familial patterns in fingerprints that predicted criminality. In grad school, Larson shifted his focus to thyroid deficiencies. The results were disappointing, so he turned to machines. Larson read an article about using blood pressure to detect deception, and decided to improve on its author’s technique by designing a machine that could do so more objectively. The polygraph was born.</p>
<p>The truer story is, as usual, more complicated. Larson’s machine was not so much an invention as it was an amalgam of existing devices. He didn’t believe it detected lies and didn’t call it a polygraph: Larson referred to his machine as an “emotion recorder.” His protégé and rival, Leonarde Keeler, would later come up with the term polygraph to help commercialize the device.</p>
<p>Polygraph organizations like to say the word means “many writings,” which is halfway true. It’s a neologist portmanteau of the Greek terms meaning exactly that, and the machine does indeed create many writings. But to claim the word means only and exactly one thing is to make the same mistake with language polygraphers habitually make with facts: believing that they’re static and absolute. Language, like truth, is neither. Words evolve and change over time and mean different things in different contexts. Polygraph has six different definitions, according to the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>—three of which predate the machine—and they range from a letter grouping in cryptography to a person imitating another to a writer of various works. (Which I guess makes this an essay about a polygraph taking a polygraph.)</p>
<p>More to the point, polygraph does not mean “lie detector.” Larson himself repudiated that term for the rest of his life. But that fact didn’t get in the way of a good story. Once the polygraph was adopted by police across America and heralded in the popular media, it took on a mythical new name: the lie detector. And as soon as the lie detector became famous, a bunch of men fought with each other for decades—mostly in their memoirs—over who was its true inventor. In his book <em>The Truth Machine: A Social History of the Lie Detector</em>, Geoffrey C. Bunn devotes an entire chapter to the question of who invented the device and offers enough credible candidates to field a baseball team: everyone from Carl Jung, who helped pioneer the field of psychology, to Étienne-Jules Marey, who did the same for cinematography. As Bunn puts it, with magisterial restraint, it was a “curious and notable fact that the lie detector’s principal actors mistrusted each other intensely.” Maybe they should have taken a polygraph to resolve the question.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>My polygraph test was the final step in a process that had begun three years earlier, when I started applying for government jobs. At the time, I was living in San Francisco, teaching at Stanford, and was nearly finished with the book. While my job sounded impressive, it paid forty thousand dollars a year and was located in one of the most expensive areas of the country. I was in the second year of a two-year contract and had been trying unsuccessfully to get a real teaching job for years, something tenure-track, or at least a lecturer gig in a more affordable city, one with benefits and some semblance of job security.</p>
<p>When I was “on the market,” as they say, I applied to teaching jobs in Fairbanks, Alaska; Birmingham, Alabama; Spokane, Washington; Camden, New Jersey; Cullowhee, North Carolina; and on and on. I spent a lot of time back then browsing Wikipedia pages for cities I’d never been to, trying to convince myself I could live there. It was a moot point. Despite dozens of interviews, I couldn’t get a professor job. My memory has condensed the experience into one vivid example, when the writing faculty of a football powerhouse down South made me fly to Chicago, in January, on my own dime, so I could sit in their hotel suite sweating through my freshly pressed suit while they asked a series of oddly combative questions for an hour and a half, after which they never bothered to contact me again to tell me that I didn’t get the job I wouldn’t have taken if my life depended on it.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, I decided to give up on academia and find a less demoralizing line of work, something with better pay, more stability, maybe even a union. I applied to be a technical writer, an FBI agent, a cop. I didn’t have any luck with those, either. My brother suggested the Border Patrol. He was an agent, and so were a half-dozen of my childhood friends and my former baseball coach. They were always hiring. The starting pay was nearly double what I made at Stanford, with much better benefits, and I might be able to move back to Arizona.</p>
<p>Most of my old friends from home thought joining the Border Patrol was a good idea. I could be closer to family, make a living, maybe even buy a house. My social circle in San Francisco was another story. By then, I’d been in academia for more than a decade, surrounded by white liberals from wealthy backgrounds. When they heard I was trying to join the Border Patrol, my new friends all said the same thing: <em>why?</em></p>
<p>I didn’t understand the question, and soon determined it was a matter of perspective. For people who grew up wealthy, or even middle-class—whatever that means—the proper career path seems to be to find a job that’s rewarding, fulfilling, whatever. I’d done every job I’d ever had for one reason, the same reason I was trying to join the Border Patrol: money. Did I want to drive around the border in an SUV detaining people? Of course not. But I didn’t want to help tech billionaires write their memoirs, either. At least the Border Patrol paid a living wage.</p>
<p>But the Border Patrol is <em>racist</em>, my friends said. And that might be true. But cries of racism rang hollow coming from people who worked in academia, one of the whitest industries in America. The Border Patrol is a hell of a lot more diverse than the average writing faculty.</p>
<p>Their underlying point was right, though: if I joined the Border Patrol, I’d be complicit. But I was already complicit. The longer I spent in higher ed, the more it seemed like an engine driving American inequality. At least the Border Patrol gave working-class people a path to economic mobility without being saddled by a lifetime of student loan debt. My brother had begun his career at the same time I’d started grad school. Nine years later, he made twice as much as I did, owned a house and a new Acura, had health insurance and a retirement account and the whole American dream. Meanwhile, in the three years since I applied to the Border Patrol, I’d taken another teaching job in Albuquerque, making forty-five grand, with shitty benefits and no long-term security. Besides, I still hadn’t decided to actually join the Border Patrol. I hadn’t been offered the job.</p>
<p>By the time I went to El Paso, I’d passed a four-hour written exam, a physical, a fitness test, an oral interview, and a background check so intensive that they’d talked to my coworkers, every neighbor in my apartment building, and my high school teachers. Once I passed the background check, I waited more than a year for the call from the polygraph office.</p>
<p>That call would be the first sign that the government and I had different ideas about truth. First, I got an email from a scheduler saying he’d been trying to reach me. I hadn’t received any messages, so I knew that wasn’t true, but had no way to prove it. I called the office and spoke to another man, who said he was a quality control agent, and that he’d call me back soon with a date and time for my appointment. He never did. Then I received a letter saying I’d been removed from consideration for refusing to take the polygraph. I called Mr. Quality Control. He accused me of lying, but grudgingly scheduled my appointment. So there I was, in a building full of liars, about to have mine detected.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Kevin started off by reminding me of the rules. One of them was that I could not discuss my test with anyone afterward. I’m sure he would have told me that I couldn’t write about it either, although I made sure not to ask. Clearly the government believed, despite all historical evidence to the contrary, in its power to control information. I believed my right to free speech was inalienable. In that sense, I guess this essay is a lie detector, too: we’re going to find out who was right.</p>
<p>Kevin ran me through some questions that might be on the test. Some were pedestrian, my name and address and so on. Others were bizarre: questions about bestiality, child porn, terrorism.</p>
<p>When he got to a question about my past drug use, Kevin’s tone changed. His smile fell and he held eye contact. The interrogation had begun. I told him the same well-rehearsed thing I’d told my background investigator: <em>I experimented with drugs a few times in high school and college</em>. It was a lie. Kevin seemed to detect it.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by few?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Not many.”</p>
<p>“Could it mean five?”</p>
<p>“I guess it <em>could</em>.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be a smartass.”</p>
<p>I looked around the room. It couldn’t be just me and Kevin. Surely there was a witness somewhere, a hidden camera, a recorder, anything to prove we actually said what his report would say we had. Later I would learn that federal polygraph protocol requires examiners to make audio recordings of exams, and that many examiners have been accused of ignoring that requirement, as well as an array of other sordid and unprofessional practices. I don’t remember Kevin saying anything about a recording, or seeing a device. But there’s no way to say for sure.</p>
<p>Kevin sighed elaborately and asked the maximum number of times I could have used illegal drugs. “Was it six? Eight?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said. “It was a long time ago.”</p>
<p>“Could it be ten?” he asked, with a smug little grin, and finally I caught on.</p>
<p>“No. Definitely not ten.” If Kevin wanted a fixed and certain truth, I’d give him one.</p>
<p>He wrote “6–8 times” on his notepad.</p>
<p>“I said it could have been that many, not that it <em>was</em>.”</p>
<p>Kevin said to let him do his job, and a shroud of dread descended. The test hadn’t even begun, and I’d already found myself at epistemological loggerheads with the federal government. Kevin thought he’d convinced me to tell the truth, which was that I’d done drugs between six and eight times in my life. I thought there was no truth to tell. I didn’t remember how many times it was. A few minutes earlier, Kevin had said there was no maximum threshold for drug use that would disqualify me—a bald-faced lie I had not yet detected—but I wasn’t about to say that the real number was closer to a hundred. So the lie became the truth: I’d done drugs six to eight times.</p>
<p><span>The polygraph works a lot like a memoir. It doesn’t find the truth, it creates it.</span></p><p>Almost immediately, I began to believe it. As I sat there watching Kevin scribble notes, a handful of specific drug experiences returned to me. The first time I got high and drunk at the same time, in eighth grade, and spent the night in my friend David’s bathroom with my head on the toilet seat while he tried to convince his mom that I had food poisoning. When Charlie taught me the trick where you blow the smoke through a paper towel tube with a fabric softener sheet rubber-banded over the end. The first line of meth I ever snorted, off a Bone Thugs CD case in Jeremy’s bedroom. The cooks at my first restaurant job going around at closing time on busy nights, handing out key bumps. The eight ball I went in on with two ex-con dishwashers at my second restaurant job, who told me they’d pay me back double in a week, but then Mike got stabbed and I realized I wasn’t cut out for that life. I never saw that money or the drugs, so maybe that one didn’t count.</p>
<p>But that was all during one relatively short period of my life, when I was a shithead teenager. I’d come so far since then. I was a college professor; technically a visiting assistant professor, but still. My memoir was about to come out. The sitting president at the time had admitted to using marijuana and cocaine in <em>his</em> memoir. Why should I be banned from a job for being a small-time delinquent twenty years ago? Remove those few wayward years and it was true enough that I’d only done drugs a few times in high school and college. As we say in the memoir business, it was <em>my</em> truth.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>My new profession, memoirist, had a complicated relationship with truth, to put it mildly. Fake-memoir scandals have erupted more or less continuously as long as America has existed, from James Frey and his contemporaries, to the so-called autobiographies of Howard Hughes and Davy Crockett, to fantastical captivity narratives of the colonial era and dubious accounts of European explorers in the New World. Sometimes it seems like every notable American figure wrote a fictionalized memoir—even Wyatt Earp, the patron saint of my hometown. (<em>Frontier Marshal</em>. It’s a hoot.) I fudged plenty of facts myself, combining real people into composite characters, changing the order of events. Most memoirists do the same. The point of the genre isn’t accuracy or precision. The point is to tell a good story.</p>
<p>The same applies to the polygraph. There’s no real evidence for the machine’s accuracy. Its purpose is to monitor the body’s physical response to stimuli, but the body’s response to lying is indistinguishable from its response to any other stimulus. Even the telltale spike in the polygraph chart, itself largely a myth created by TV and movies, can indicate anything from a heart problem to sexual attraction. (Indeed, the machine’s inventors used it to detect both of those things. Larson married one of his first test subjects, and Keeler discovered a heart defect while testing the machine on himself.)</p>
<p>But from the early years of the machine to the present day, its proponents have told the same story of an infallible machine that detects lies. Polygraph organizations routinely estimate its accuracy at nearly 100 percent. Most of those estimates are invented out of thin air, and the few based on data suffer from an obvious sampling error. As early as 1939, Walter Summers—yet another purported inventor of a lie detector—pointed out the fundamental flaw on which all polygraph statistics are based: they “fail to relate the number of instances in which deception was actually practiced in a manner which eluded the examiner and the instrument.” You can’t detect the lies you can’t detect.</p>
<p>Independent studies suggest a polygraph exam is roughly as accurate as a coin flip, and that polygraph operators find as many as half of innocent subjects guilty. The scientific case against the polygraph is so compelling that the National Academy of Sciences, the American Psychological Association, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, and the United States Supreme Court have dismissed it as unreliable. A federal law forbids using the polygraph to screen applicants to private companies. For most jobs in America, an exam like mine would’ve been against the law.</p>
<p>In fact, the only people who seem to believe the polygraph is accurate are its operators. Every study I’ve found that supports the machine’s ability to detect deception was funded or performed by polygraphers. They’ve formed half a dozen different organizations dedicated to spreading the lie of the lie detector. Their websites are ironically similar to the polygraph itself: archaic, slipshod, rife with bias and bullshit. The International League of Polygraph Examiners calls the device’s invention “officially one of the greatest of all time,” and claims the accuracy of contemporary polygraphs is close to 100 percent. The American Polygraph Association, which claims to be the largest organization of polygraphers, has a section of its website devoted to Polygraph Validity Research.</p>
<p>It begins by stating the organization “<em>believes</em> that scientific evidence supports the validity of polygraph examinations.” The site includes a link to what seems to be the entire basis of that belief, the “Meta-Analytic Survey of Criterion Accuracy of Validated Polygraph Techniques.” The document was prepared by a team of polygraphers, and it reads about how you’d expect. I made it far enough to learn a few astounding facts, including that until 2012, the American Polygraph Association did not require members to use methods supported by published research. In other words, for the first ninety-one years of its existence, polygraphers literally had no scientific standards. Luckily for me, they came up with some just in time for my exam.</p>
<p>The lie detector was like any true story in America: the facts didn’t matter as long as a lot of people believed it. And we wanted to believe it: the notion of a lie detector existed long before the polygraph did. Tellingly, it first appeared in fiction. Bunn traces its first known usage to Charles Walk’s 1909 detective novel <em>The Yellow Circle</em>, in which a character fantasizes about having a machine he calls a lie detector: “With its aid one can plumb the bottomless pits of a chap’s subconscious mind, and fathom all the mysteries of his subliminal ego.” In 1914, seven years before anyone claimed to have invented a polygraph, G. K. Chesterton mocked the notion of a lie detector in his mystery story <em>The Mistake of the Machine</em>, comparing it to the Dark Ages belief that blood would flow from a victim’s body if their murderer touched it. Bunn lists many other instances of lie detectors appearing in fiction long before anyone claimed to have invented one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the popular American media seemed obsessed with the idea of machines that could see inside our heads, hearts, and souls. Fourteen years before Larson’s polygraph debuted, the <em>New York Times</em> ran an article rhapsodizing about Jung’s electric psychometer. That “mysterious little machine” purported to detect emotions, not lies; still, the article foretold a future when it would be used to detect guilt, making criminal courts superfluous. Four years later, the same paper ran a two-page profile of the “big-hearted” men, Edward Johnstone and Henry Goddard, who’d been doing the “self-sacrificing work” of testing the psychometer on developmentally disabled children at an institution in New Jersey. Under Johnstone’s supervision, Goddard hooked kids up to a machine like Jung’s. Their intent was to study and eradicate “feeble-mindedness”; Johnstone was a noted member of the American eugenics movement. But the article breathlessly predicted a future in which the lie detector would replace the “impedimenta” of American justice, like judges and juries.</p>
<p>When the story started circulating that a cop with a PhD had invented a lie-detecting machine, a myth became a widely reported fact almost overnight. Within a year, the<em> San Francisco Examiner</em> claimed, “everyone has heard of the ‘lie detector.’” By then, polygraph results had already been banned from American courts, by a judge who was less enthused about the prospect of a machine replacing juries. It would be the first of many official dismissals of the polygraph. But it didn’t dampen the media’s fascination with the so-called lie detector—and, by extension, the American public’s.</p>
<p>That fascination was furthered by the polygraph’s sister inventions, psychology and cinematography, which were created by some of the same men at around the same time. In addition to his psychometer, Jung also helped create the field of modern psychology. Marey developed a different forerunner of the polygraph, as well as chronophotography, an important step in the development of cinema. Marston pioneered the idea of detecting lies based on physical responses, and later became a Hollywood censor and wrote a guide for aspiring screenwriters. His academic mentor, Hugo Münsterberg, helped lay the theoretical groundwork for the polygraph, and also published one of the earliest works of film theory.</p>
<p>The rise of psychology helped drive a cultural fascination with discovering the inner workings of the mind—especially the criminal mind—a desire the lie detector satisfied. Meanwhile, cinematography, the notion that we could document and preserve reality itself, had embarked on its ongoing project of destroying our cultural distinctions between fiction and fact.</p>
<p>Throughout its history, the polygraph has moved freely between the two realms. As it spread to police departments across the country, who used it to investigate real crimes, the machine also began to appear in advertisements and movies. The machine may have made its screen debut in the 1926 silent-film serial <em>Officer 444</em>, alongside Vollmer, who played an idealized version of himself, a criminologist using science against evil. By the 1930s, Marston was using the polygraph to screen-test Hollywood films, including <em>Frankenstein</em>—ironic, considering that Larson once compared his invention to the Monster—and to sell razor blades, gasoline, and cigarettes. In 1941, Marston invented Wonder Woman, a female superhero whose primary power was a Lasso of Truth, similar to a lie detector. Marston called the comic “psychological propaganda,” and it was hugely effective: within a year, Wonder Woman had her own comic book with a circulation of half a million. In 1946, Keeler starred in a noir movie alongside his version of the machine. The first TV show called <em>Lie Detector</em> debuted in the fifties; there have since been a handful of others, both scripted and reality, not to mention a continuous stream of polygraph appearances in film and television. While writing this essay, I watched lie detectors play prominent roles in two different TV shows. In one, the polygraph is accurate; in the other, it isn’t.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Kevin slid a blank sheet of paper across the desk and told me to draw the number five inside a black circle. I did, and slid it back. Kevin drew other numbers in other circles and said now he was going to hook me up to the machine.</p>
<p>He told me to take off my shoes and empty my pockets, then directed me to the chair. I sat on one sensor and put my feet on two others. Kevin wrapped two cords around my chest, slid a sphygmomanometer over my left arm, and stuck metal clamps on my right index and ring fingers. As he pumped up the cuff, Kevin asked if I was comfortable. He didn’t seem to be joking.</p>
<p>He sat behind his desk and said he was going to point to all the numbers on the paper and ask if I’d written them. I should say no every time, even for the one I’d written. He did. I did. He unhooked me, led me to the desk, and pointed to the lie on the computer screen. It looked like a lot of squiggly lines to me.</p>
<p>“Now we can take a break,” Kevin said. I looked at the clock, which wasn’t visible from the polygraph chair; we’d only been in the room for half an hour. Kevin smiled inscrutably. “Bathroom and water only. Be back in ten minutes.”</p>
<p>I wandered into the hallway, drank from a fountain, leaned against another beige wall, and tried to calm down. I was not then in a great place, psychologically speaking. I stayed up until sunrise a few nights a week, spent days on end inside my apartment, often went blank with anxiety in front of my classes, and was preoccupied by a vivid and persistent vision of myself swan-diving off my balcony. I would later be diagnosed with various conditions and embark upon a reasonably successful therapeutic journey, but right then, in that hallway, I was freaking the fuck out. My shirt clung wetly to my chest, where I could see my heart beating as if it was trying to escape, like the alien in <em>Alien</em>. If I had a heart attack in the chair, what would that look like on the polygraph readout?</p>
<p>I’d tried to learn techniques for managing anxiety. Most of them didn’t work— picture a beach, my ass—but a shrink I’d briefly seen had suggested imagining the worst possible outcome, and that seemed helpful. The idea was that you embrace the notion of failure and realize it wouldn’t be so bad, thereby relieving the pressure not to fail.</p>
<p>I tried it. What if I failed the poly? I’d go back to Albuquerque, keep teaching, apply for more jobs. This was my backup plan, which made me luckier than pretty much everyone else applying. Then again, that was not the worst-case situation. One problem with that exercise is that I could always come up with something worse. What if I got in a car accident on my tired four-hour drive and spent the rest of my pain-filled life alone in my rented house in Albuquerque? What if I passed the poly, got the job, and actually took it—got sent to some borderland armpit like Ajo or Wellton where I’d have to herd other human beings into the back of trucks? Woke up two or ten or thirty years down the road and didn’t recognize myself?</p>
<p>By the time Kevin came to get me, a few minutes sooner than the ten I’d been promised, I’d almost accepted my imminent failure. If my anxiety didn’t make me fail the test, something else would. I remembered something from my sorta-research about Catholics failing the polygraph at higher rates. Technically I was Catholic, baptized and confirmed, now lapsed, but that only made things worse. Maybe I’d ask Kevin how to become a polygrapher. How much training did it require? Did he enjoy it? How much money did he make? Later, I’d search around online and find out that the average polygraph examiner makes even less than I did at the time. Then again, the training only takes ten weeks, and there are actually jobs in that field. I’d been training for years to be a nonfiction professor and still had no idea what truth actually meant; maybe I should’ve just taken a polygraph course and become an official federal arbiter of facts, an asshole demigod like Kevin.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t be so hard on Kevin. Judging by his clothes and demeanor, he probably came from a similar background to mine. Maybe polygraphing was his version of teaching, a thing he did to pay the bills because it was better than his other options. Maybe he had a whole life to maintain, a family, a little house in some cul-de-sac on the West Side, two Toyotas and a swing set.</p>
<p>While Kevin strapped me back into the chair, I wondered what he told himself at night, trying to sleep, after watching applicants lose their best hope for a career to his machine. Kevin seemed like a smart guy, way too smart to believe in the simpleminded fantasy of a machine that detects lies. But that wasn’t his decision. It was his employer’s. And why is our government the only major employer in the world that uses polygraphs to screen prospective hires?</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The answer to that question is based on a lie. Even the United States government isn’t dumb enough to believe the polygraph works. The machine’s real purpose is symbolic, as an icon of the power of the state. Law enforcement agencies don’t use the machine to detect lies. They use it to coerce confessions.</p>
<p>In its early days, the polygraph was considered a more humane version of the infamous “third degree,” the interrogation procedure it largely replaced, which involved beating the shit out of a suspect until they confessed. The third degree was itself a variation of another quintessentially American tactic, outright torture. The parallels between torture and the polygraph are obvious: the latter’s arcane parts and procedures, its use of restraints and stimuli, the gratuitous periods of waiting for what the subject knows is coming. The polygraph creates the very stress it’s designed to detect, then presents it as evidence of deception, which often leads its subject to confess. If the subject confesses, that confession effectively <em>becomes</em> the truth, whether it’s true or false or somewhere in between.</p>
<p>And the polygraph has a long history of coercing false confessions. It may begin with its maiden voyage in 1921, when Larson tested his new device on the residents of an all-female Berkeley dorm that had experienced a rash of petty thefts. Thanks in part to the polygraph, a suspect admitted to most of the thefts and withdrew from the university. But the crimes continued, and Larson himself doubted the veracity of her confession.</p>
<p>Not long after, Larson tested a man named Henry Wilkens who was accused of having his wife killed. The polygraph helped to exonerate Wilkens despite evidence of his guilt. After that, police began to doubt the polygraph’s utility, and some departments refused to use it. (The media had no such qualms: it continued to trumpet the infallibility of the “electric detective.”)</p>
<p>A year after the Wilkens case, a young Black man named James Frye retracted his confession to killing a Washington, DC, doctor, claiming it was coerced. Using his variation of the lie detector, Marston examined Frye and declared him innocent. But the judge prevented Marston from testifying as an expert at trial, and an appeals court upheld the ruling, instituting what became known as the Frye rule, which has largely prevented polygraph results from being admissible in American courts ever since.</p>
<p>But the machine remains useful for extracting confessions. And the conflation of confessions and truth is yet another lie, one that’s kept the polygraph alive for the last century as a peculiarly American delusion. Confessions are usually presumed to be true and treated as such in legal settings. But recent research suggests that false confessions are common, especially in the context of police interrogations.</p>
<p>Despite a growing body of evidence, including hundreds of exonerations based on DNA evidence, most people don’t believe in false confessions. A recent article in the <em>Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law</em> explains why:</p>
<p>Most lay people believe in what has been referred to as the myth of psychological interrogation: that an innocent person will not falsely confess to police unless he is physically tortured or mentally ill…the myth of psychological interrogation persists because most people do not know what occurs during police interrogations, and because they wrongly assume that individuals do not act against their self-interest or engage in self-destructive behavior, such as falsely confessing to a crime that they did not commit.</p>
<p>The likelihood of a false confession increases when interrogators use certain tactics, especially elements of the so-called Reid Technique, a procedure created in the 1950s by John E. Reid. I didn’t know it at the time, but Kevin used elements of the Reid Technique in my test. He conducted it in a small, barely furnished, cold room; seated me in a hard, armless, straight-backed chair; and repeatedly encroached on my personal space.</p>
<p>Reid first used his technique (along with a polygraph) in 1955, to extract a confession from a man named Darrel Parker who was suspected of killing his wife. Parker was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. He served fifteen years before being released on appeal because Parker’s confession was ruled to have been coerced. Eighteen years after Parker’s release, a man on death row for other crimes confessed to the murder; he did so by showing his lawyers a passage of his memoirs that described the murder in detail, a passage the legal system apparently assumed to be true.</p>
<p>Neither those nor the Reid Technique’s subsequent high-profile failures, including the $2m settlement of a 2012 civil case by a wrongly convicted man named Juan Rivera, have prevented it from being adopted by police departments across America. The company founded in Reid’s name, John E. Reid and Associates, claims its technique is “the most widely used approach to question subjects in the world,” and recently registered a trademark on the term.</p>
<p>The Reid Technique™ involves a number of tactics, from creating an anxiety-inducing environment to a list of specific steps. According to Saul Kassin, perhaps the foremost American expert on false confessions, the purpose of those tactics is to “get suspects to incriminate themselves by increasing the anxiety associated with denial, plunging the subject into a state of despair and then minimizing the perceived consequences of confession.”</p>
<p>Like the polygraph, the Reid Technique isn’t designed to find the truth. Its purpose is to coerce confessions. Research suggests the Reid Technique may actually make interrogators <em>worse</em> at detecting truth. In an independent study, interrogators trained in the Reid Technique were less accurate, although “they were more confident and cited more reasons for their judgments.”</p>
<p><span>Myths exist for a reason, to explain collective phenomena, to explain us to ourselves.</span></p><p>The polygraph itself is not required for the Reid Technique, but it helps. Together, they have a long and checkered history of producing false confessions. In 2013, the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> found a pattern of false confessions obtained via polygraph exams and the Reid Technique, by examiners who routinely ignored accepted standards, including failing or refusing to record interrogations.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Kevin said the first battery of questions would cover my character, and asked if I had any questions. I did, but too many, and where to start? So I said no, and Kevin started the exam.</p>
<p>He asked me a battery of eight questions four times in different orders. By the time I typed notes on my phone after the test, I’d already forgotten one of them. The other seven were:</p>
<p>1. Have you misrepresented your past drug use?<br>
2. Have you lied about participating in serious crimes?<br>
3. Have you falsified info on forms?<br>
4. Have you ever cheated to get ahead in your personal life?<br>
5. Have you ever made disparaging comments about your supervisor?<br>
6. Is the light on?<br>
7. Have you taken a drink of water today?</p>
<p>Except for the last two, all of them seemed open to interpretation. For instance, I absolutely had misrepresented my past drug use, but only the number of times, not the drugs or the fact of doing them. And could my estimate be a lie when there’s no way to know the exact answer? What crimes are considered serious? What counts as cheating? Who gets to say? Has any employed person in America not made a single disparaging comment about a supervisor?</p>
<p>The first time through the questions, I tried to follow Kevin’s direction to answer quickly, yes or no, and to abide by his somewhat contradictory instructions to breathe normally while staying absolutely still. The second time through, my voice began to crack, and I swallowed.</p>
<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>I turned my head to see who he was yelling at.</p>
<p>“Stay completely still!”</p>
<p>I turned back to the wall and tried to comply. Kevin kept yelling, asking combative and rhetorical questions: was I <em>trying</em> to beat the test, did I <em>want</em> to fail? I tried to calm myself by imagining something peaceful, although that was probably considered a countermeasure, and anyway, it didn’t work: I visualized ripping off the electrodes and punching Kevin. I tried the box-breathing technique I’d once learned from a veteran stepdad. That worked better. Possibly too well. Soon I caught myself nodding off.</p>
<p>That probably sounds like a lie. How could someone under that much stress be sleepy? Have you ever been interrogated? I don’t mean metaphorically, having a difficult conversation, confessing something to a spouse, parent, priest, boss. I mean actually interrogated, by a professional. No lawyer, no witnesses, nobody on your side. And he has a machine that says he’s right, not to mention the backing of the Department of Homeland Security, a vast and unaccountable agency built on the lie that policing and surveilling Americans will protect us from terrorism. Suddenly, this part of the Border Patrol application process made a grim kind of sense: I was getting a little taste of how an immigrant might feel. Except I deserved it. I’d signed up for this.</p>
<p>If you haven’t been in that situation, maybe you think, like I did before it was proven otherwise, that you’d be one of the exceptions. You’d beat the polygraph, like people do on TV. But that’s the thing: you can’t beat the polygraph, because the polygraph isn’t a lie detector, isn’t a test, isn’t even a machine. It’s a fact, part of a story power tells itself to justify its power. Maybe you can beat the machine— they don’t detect lies, so it’s not that hard—but you can’t beat an entire country that believes in it.</p>
<p>As Kevin went through the questions again, I sank into a fugue, part paranoia and part exhaustion, and lost track of time. Not what time it was—the whole idea of time. There was no past or future, only an endless present of sitting in that windowless room, strapped to a chair, wired to a machine, staring at a beige wall while a stranger I couldn’t see asked the same questions, over and over. I forgot why I was there, who I was, the truth and what it meant. At some point, I heard a sort of flutter, and my vision vibrated and jumped, as if someone had changed the reel. My mind floated up to the corner of the room and observed the proceedings from a cool remove. My memory of the rest of the test is from a vantage point outside of my body.</p>
<p>Jung defined this phenomenon as dissociation, the loss of a fixed and coherent identity. Reports of similar experiences were largely ignored in early psychology, but more recent studies suggest dissociation is fairly common, and can be triggered by drugs, trauma, stress, or nothing at all. Jung said dissociative states could prevent a subject from recalling important facts, among other things. “We talk about being able to control ourselves,” he wrote. “But self-control is a rare and remarkable virtue.”</p>
<p>The polygraph showed me I was neither rare nor remarkable. By the final time through the battery, I no longer knew what was true. For example: the first three times Kevin asked if I’d ever disparaged a supervisor, I’d rationalized, telling myself “disparaged” was a strong word. It means to regard as having little worth, and older definitions meant to dishonor or degrade; did Kevin know it came from the Old French <em>disparagier</em>, to marry unequally? Certainly I’d made fun of some bosses, and respected few, but I hadn’t disparaged my supervisors, per se. The fourth time he asked me the question, a crystalline memory popped into my detached head, a moment a few years before when I told my then-girlfriend that my then-boss was a fucking idiot.</p>
<p>“No,” I said. Kevin moved on.</p>
<p>Later I would learn that I wasn’t the first lie detector subject to report experiencing dissociation. I’m not even the first one to write about it. As an undergraduate at Harvard, Gertrude Stein worked in a laboratory run by Hugo Münsterberg, who came up with the earliest scientific rationale for lie detection. Stein’s first published work, an 1894 essay originally written for her sophomore composition class titled “In the Psychological Laboratory,” was an account of her experiences in the lab, including an instance of being connected to one of Münsterberg’s primitive predecessors of the polygraph. The essay’s third person narration and distinctive syntax are both harbingers of Stein’s future work, and her knowledge of the machine seems to have informed her later experiments in “automatic writing.” (It’s also worth noting that her autobiography has fictional elements.)</p>
<p>But her account interests me for other reasons. She describes the experience of being subjected to an exam in front of a group of students like so:</p>
<p>Strange fancies begin to crowd upon her, she feels that the silent pen is writing on and on forever. Her record is there she cannot escape it and the group about her begin to assume the shape of mocking fiends gloating over her imprisoned misery. Suddenly she starts, they have suddenly loosened a metronome directly behind her, to observe the effect, so now the morning’s work is over.</p>
<p>What it describes sounds like dissociation, or exactly what I felt when I was subjected to the polygraph.</p>
<p>The scientific literature suggests dissociation during polygraph exams is fairly common. In 1996, the polygrapher Donald J. Krapohl wrote an article for <em>Polygraph</em>, the official organ of the American Polygraph Association, that addresses the phenomenon. The article is typical of polygraphers’ attempts at justifying their profession in the sense that it’s paranoid, authoritarian, proto-fascist, and presents the opinions and experiences of a single polygraph operator as if they’re commandments carved into tablets. Krapohl begins with a blithe, moralistic tirade about “the phenomenon of mendacity” that “pervades every class and culture.” Lying, he claims, is endemic to certain types of people, having “served to defend or expand the interests of uncounted generations of monarchs, merchants, spouses, debtors, knaves, and saints.”</p>
<p>Kraphol attempts to codify four classes of countermeasures. The first, Physical Countermeasures, includes any instance in which a polygraph subject “use[s] movements in hopes of masking their reactions or misdirecting the examiner.” Of course, a polygraph subject might move for any number of reasons during an exam, including as a natural reaction to the very discomfort and stress it’s designed to cause; no examiner or machine can determine <em>why</em>. And one wonders why a test so supposedly accurate can be fooled by something as simple as flexing a muscle.</p>
<p>The second category, “Mental Countermeasures,” includes imagery, hypnosis, biofeedback training, placebos, and even personality. Notably, dissociation is considered a mental countermeasure. Here, again, is the rub: if the subject dissociates during a polygraph, who’s to say whether it’s intentional? Even Krapohl acknowledges that “the outward appearance of a dissociating subject is quite similar to that of a cooperating test subject.” In other words, nobody can tell if another person is dissociating, much less why. Even the person dissociating may not know; I certainly didn’t at the time. Studies suggest dissociation is often an unconscious response to intense stress of the sort the polygraph is designed to create in its subject. The polygraph works by stressing you out, but if the stress it causes in turn causes the subject to dissociate, they can be failed for trying to cheat.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Kevin gave me another break. I spent it in the waiting area, staring out over the rooftops of El Paso. The window faced east, so I couldn’t see the border, but the border is like the truth: you know when you’re close to it. After a few minutes, Kevin came and led me back into the interrogation room, where he sat me down and said I’d failed. The machine detected deception in my answers to either the drug question or the falsifying information question. I was amazed: he couldn’t even tell which question I’d lied about? And why hadn’t he detected my lie about disparaging my boss?</p>
<p>Kevin went on to say that I must have researched tactics to defeat the poly. My swallowing seemed to bother him to the point that he considered it evidence of deception. I said my mouth had been dry, but Kevin ignored me, telling stories about his brother who’d done drugs and other applicants who said they’d gotten high a thousand times. I didn’t know it at the time, but his psychological tactics were all elements of the Reid Technique: repeated, unwavering assertions of guilt; attempts to excuse or minimize the suspected crime; constant interruptions; professed sympathy; and, of course, outright lies.</p>
<p>Kevin said he was almost positive that my drug use wasn’t over the threshold. Earlier, he’d told me there was no threshold, and it dawned on me that Kevin wasn’t much of an interrogator without his machine. He kept fishing, accusing me of various lies, interrupting whenever I tried to deny, suggesting things I may have forgotten: didn’t I ever do any pills when I was a bartender? Did I really only do meth once or twice? He began pointing to the computer screen and picking up other deceptions. He detected possible lies in my academic record—I told him I’d gotten a 3.0 GPA at a state school, and why the hell would anybody lie about that?—and questioned whether I really had a master’s degree, even though I’d provided transcripts as part of my background investigation.</p>
<p>He accused, I denied, and it became the worst kind of male interaction, a matter of pride. He was lying, I was lying, everything we said was both true and false, depending how you looked at it. I wasn’t even hooked up to the machine anymore, so I didn’t understand why we were still talking. He’d already said that I failed. Couldn’t we call it a day?</p>
<p>As Kevin’s one-man theater dragged on, I thought about the long drive ahead of me, and began to understand why people make false confessions. It’s not because you don’t know the truth. It’s because the truth doesn’t matter. When the person across the table has all the power, what’s the point of arguing? It was pretty clear by then, a few hours into a test I’d already failed, that Kevin didn’t give a damn what was true. He wouldn’t be satisfied until I confessed. But fuck Kevin and his machine. I wasn’t confessing.</p>
<p>Kevin paused, and I thought we might finally be done until he asked about my mother’s murder: was there anything I hadn’t told him about <em>that</em>? It broke the spell. I dissociated in reverse, came fully into my body. My chest relaxed, my heart quieted, and I saw the situation clearly for the first time. Kevin was just some dickhead with a grift, doing a job based on lies for a government that practically invented them. Did I know anything about my mother’s murder? I’d spent five years writing about it. I was the world’s foremost authority on the subject. But I wasn’t telling Kevin. If he wanted to know, he could buy the fucking book.</p>
<p>I asked if I was free to leave. He shrugged. As I stood and went for the door, he asked if I would come back for another test with him if necessary. Sure, I said. I’d love to. It was the last thing I would ever say to Kevin, and I wanted to make sure it was a lie.</p>
<p>When I got home, I checked the internet forum and read a post by the guy who’d been sitting with me in the waiting room. He’d failed, too. His story was almost exactly the same as mine, except his test took twice as long. He must have tried harder than I did to tell the truth.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Three weeks later, my book came out, and I once again found myself answering questions. Whenever someone asked about truth, I’d say that I consulted the historical record when possible, but that the book was mostly based on memory. Sometimes, despite myself, that old cliche slipped out: <em>it’s my truth</em>. I’d think about the polygraph, Kevin’s endless questions, his assumption that a fixed, detectable truth existed in my memory.</p>
<p>Writing a book based on memory showed me it’s less a font of truth than a river of lies. We may tell ourselves stories in order to live, as Didion famously said, but nobody ever quotes the rest of that passage: “We live entirely, especially if we are writers, by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images, by the ‘ideas’ with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria which is our actual experience.” That sounds a lot like lying.</p>
<p>Even if we mean to tell the truth, the existing science suggests that memory is almost as unreliable as the polygraph. In 1885, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus did tests on himself and came up with his famed “forgetting curve,” a chart that showed we forget more than half of information within a few days. More recent studies have found that autobiographical memory—the deliberate recollection of facts, ideas, and experiences from one’s life—is not only inaccurate, but suggestible and frequently false. And factors such as depression and trauma, both psychological and physical, have been found to degrade autobiographical memory.</p>
<p>Then there’s the issue of stress, which also seems to have a range of effects on memory. Stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline have been shown to aid in memory consolidation, which is, more or less, the process of storing recently learned information as memories for long-term recall. But those memories can change each time they’re remembered, through a process called reconsolidation: once accessed, the memory has to be rewritten, and it can be rewritten differently, revised just like a scene in a memoir. While stress may aid in memory consolidation, it has a profoundly negative effect on reconsolidation. Trauma has its own story to tell.</p>
<p><span>We’re all polygraphers, staring at the screens of our truth machines, proving ourselves right.</span></p><p>By the time I took the polygraph, my memory had already been rewritten. After five years of accessing and re-accessing memories of my mother and her death, I’d recently begun to understand how dangerous it is to write a book based primarily on memory. I don’t mean the truth: accuracy is overrated, not to mention impossible. The real danger is the sacrifice you have to make. By writing your memories, and rewriting them again and again, draft after draft, you replace them, erase them. By the time I finished my book, after revising every word half a dozen times, I didn’t remember my mother anymore. She was pages, scenes, sentences.</p>
<p>The polygraph works a lot like a memoir. It doesn’t find the truth, it creates it. First the exam makes you doubt or forget your memories. Then, by forcing you to re-access them again and again under stress, it literally rewrites them. Since my polygraph exam, I’ve believed that I did drugs between six and eight times before then, even though my rational mind knows that isn’t true. My experience of being polygraphed showed me that not only does the polygraph not detect lies, it manufactures them.</p>
<p>More than two million polygraph exams are given every year in America; it’s a two-billion-dollar industry. No other country in the world uses the poly to nearly the extent that we do, and most don’t use it at all. Why are we the only ones who build machines to detect the truth, and believe that they can, despite all evidence to the contrary? Why do we need to believe in a truth so simple it can be detected by a machine?</p>
<p>The lie detector is a myth. Everyone who doesn’t make money off of polygraphs agrees on that. But myths exist for a reason, to explain collective phenomena, to explain us to ourselves. Myths create a sense of community through shared belief. Judging by our obsession with lie detectors—and the fact that we continue to call them that, more than a century into this charade—the myth of a simple, detectable truth is one of the few beliefs most Americans do still share.</p>
<p>The lie detector came straight out of science fiction, and drifted into the realm of fact at the beginning of a century in which a succession of groundbreaking technologies would shatter and reshape our cultural conceptions of what was possible: Edison’s bulbs, Bell’s telephone, Ford’s mass-produced cars, the Wright Brothers’ airplane. By the time the polygraph came along, a credulous American public was used to tales of revolutionary, terrifying innovations that were going to change their lives forever. Some of those technologies were transforming reality itself.</p>
<p>Electricity was spreading across the country, quite literally changing the way people saw the world. So were telephone and radio access, which did the same for how we heard it. The polygraph’s siblings, cinema and psychology, were transforming the way people saw themselves. Meanwhile, Modernism—the artistic movement responding to those changes—was roiling the arts in every medium, revising our expressions of lived and imagined reality; the United States government banned James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> the same year the polygraph debuted.</p>
<p>How it must have felt to be a human then. A man my age in 1921 might have remembered reading dime Westerns by candlelight as a boy, riding a horse to school, a time before voices—much less humans—could travel through the air. He’d seen the Progressive era rewrite the rules of society, including the victory of women’s suffrage the year before. He might have fought in the first World War. By the time the polygraph was invented, he may have owned a car or had access to a telephone, if he was wealthy. But he still got his news from newspapers or neighbors. He didn’t own a screen. Can we blame him for believing in a simple kind of truth that a new device could find?</p>
<p>A century later, I’m awash in new technologies, and deeply confused about what to believe. I was a young adult when smartphones arrived, in college when Facebook debuted, and dimly remember an early childhood before the internet changed everything. In the last few years, as of this writing, the COVID-19 pandemic has altered American life in ways nobody comprehends. Nobody trusts the media anymore, and appalling numbers of Americans refuse to believe in fundamental, verifiable facts. Meanwhile, conspiracies ricochet around the internet, gathering believers.</p>
<p>It’s hard not to see this moment as a parallel of the polygraph’s invention, another time when technology has done a number on whatever shared sense of truth America once had. That erosion has worsened our cultural and political divisions, which often hinge on what kind of truth we believe in: relative and constructed, or absolute and fixed. A century ago, the polygraph was born from the latter belief. But the notion of objective truth seems quaint and naïve in our era of fake news and algorithms, when the only truth that still exists is ours, a custom reality created for us and delivered to our devices. We’re all memoirists now, shouting our stories into the void. We’re all polygraphers, staring at the screens of our truth machines, proving ourselves right.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>A few months after the exam, I got the official news: not only had I been found unsuitable for employment, I also had no right to appeal the decision and was barred from reapplying for a minimum of three years. The consequences of my polygraph exam were finally clear, the only real truth revealed in the whole process: I was never going to be a federal agent.</p>
<p>I wasn’t alone. I soon found out that Customs and Border Protection job applicants had a polygraph failure rate of 68.1 percent, more than double that of other law enforcement agencies. The CBP commissioner at the time said those statistics showed the polygraph was working and blamed the quality of the applicants. It struck me as a strange rhetorical strategy to suggest that his agency attracted applicants so much worse than those of any other law enforcement body in America, but what did I know: I was one of those applicants. One article described polygraph subjects being accused with no evidence of cheating on their wives and having cartel connections, in exams lasting eight hours or longer. Other law enforcement agencies called CBP’s conduct excessive, and Jeff Flake, then a Republican Senator from Arizona, suggested that operators were being forced to fail applicants to justify their own jobs.</p>
<p>A few months after my exam, I got an email officially notifying me of my failure. I replied to the email and asked for a copy of the polygraph report. The CBP representative told me I’d have to file a Freedom of Information Act request. I did. They ignored my request for four months, in violation of FOIA. When I threatened legal action, they denied my request for other reasons, both of which were lies.</p>
<p>I filed another FOIA request and was still waiting for a response when the Office of Personnel Management announced that it had suffered a data breach. The personnel files of millions of federal employees and applicants had been stolen by Chinese hackers. An investigation ensued, and the Inspector General accused OPM officials of lying about the hack. Multiple high-ranking officials, including the director of OPM, resigned in the aftermath.</p>
<p>Eventually I received a letter from the replacement director alerting me that I’d been affected by the hack. (In the letter, she admitted that her own background check had also been compromised, as if that was supposed to make me feel better.) The most sensitive imaginable document about my life—one that included all of my personal and financial information, as well as a complete history of my jobs, residences, and relationships—had been stolen. The government’s solution was to offer free credit monitoring to those affected.</p>
<p>As of this writing, it’s been more than a decade since my polygraph exam, and the government still hasn’t sent me a copy of the report. But at least now I know the truth is out there. It’s on a hard drive somewhere in China.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article-body" data-attribute="article-content-body" data-component="article-content-body"><p>In a basement on London’s <!-- -->Hatton Garden<!-- -->, a small production team is heating a furnace to 2,000C — a temperature that will obliterate most materials placed within it. Each day, here at precious metals refiner Mastermelt, the furnace is fed a diet of objects collected from jewellers’ workshops — full bags from vacuum cleaners, used wet wipes, blunted sandpaper and even old carpets — in the hope that when the ashes are processed, thousands of pounds’ worth of gold, platinum and more will remain.</p>
<p>“We always tell people, don’t throw anything away,” says Gary Williams, a director at Mastermelt, who the previous week paid out £17,000 to a jeweller who had been casually stockpiling the general detritus a workshop produces. “He’d just been saving all this stuff and didn’t realise what it was worth.” Mastermelt makes its money by taking a commission on the value of the scrap metal refined, as well as charging for processing.</p>
<p>Part of Mr Williams’ job is to educate jewellers on the financial rewards of hoarding every waste-attracting object and sending the haul — known as a sweep — to a refiner to be melted down and the precious metals reclaimed. Most jewellers will be astute enough to collect hard scrap, also known as lemel, which includes filings caught in animal skins hung beneath workbenches for this very reason, or clippings from claws cut to size when setting a diamond in a ring. Once weighed, the value of this scrap can be easily ascertained, and Mastermelt has an app that can be downloaded to give jewellers access to live prices.</p>

<figure data-component="image-set"><picture><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Ac63e5f56-d924-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3Ac63e5f56-d924-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=2 2x" width="2048" height="1152"><img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc63e5f56-d924-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1" alt="Mastermelt, Hatton Garden" data-image-type="image" width="2048" height="1152" loading="lazy"></picture><figcaption><span>The transformation of the residue into molten gold</span><span> <!-- -->© Charlie Bibby</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the precious metal they cannot see may bring in surprising amounts of money too. The grinding, filing and buffing required to create jewels by hand or machine send microscopic clouds of precious dust into the air; the dust can land anywhere and be easily transported as it sticks to shoes and clothing. “We went to a workshop in Birmingham and right at the front of the building was a big 4ft sq coconut mat,” says Mr Williams. “Every single person coming in and out of the building walked over that mat, and had been doing so for seven or eight years.</p>
<p>“They didn’t think it was worth anything as it wasn’t in the workshop, but they let me take it away. We swept up the dirt and processed it and it came to quite a few thousand pounds.” Another surprise source was a pair of chair covers from a shop in Hatton Garden which were so choked with platinum dust that Mastermelt paid out £3,000 after processing them.</p>
<p>Mr Williams has a vault of stories about reclamation and its valuable surprises, but most of them are kept inside the trade. “People don’t really like it being talked about as this is their Christmas bonus,” he says. “Whatever money you make from reclamation is cash flow for your business. It’s found money.”</p>
<p>Timing is important in making sure a reclamation is as profitable as possible. First, a jeweller must ensure they have accumulated a large enough sweep to make a profit. Stuart Wibberley, sales director at Cooksongold, another refiner, says processing carries a flat fee of about £300 “whether you have 30 bags or 300”. (Mastermelt says its fees are variable, typically about £4 per kilo processed.) Then there are metal prices: Mr Williams says Mastermelt was “inundated” after the vote for Brexit in June, when the gold price spiked from $1,265 per oz the day before to $1,316 per oz the day after.</p>

<p>Reclaiming precious metal waste has always been a cornerstone of a jewellery workshop’s routine, but the practice has rarely been as sophisticated as it is today. “It really was considered a bonus in the trade,” says Mark Brittain, whose family business, Brittains Marking, creates complex tools for the luxury jewellery industry.</p>
<p>He ran the company, which was founded in 1850, from the 1970s until the early 2000s, when he retired from the jewellery trade. He now operates a commercial property business in Birmingham.</p>
<p>Mr Brittain recalls old-fashioned sweet jars being filled with tiny coils of metal, a byproduct of engraving cufflinks. The owner of one particular London jeweller that Brittains Marking worked with in the 1980s kept all the engraving scraps that were not requested by customers — Mr Brittain says some clients were indeed savvy enough to ask for theirs back — and cashed it in once a year to fund a cruise aboard the QE2 luxury liner.</p>
<p>This was during what some in the trade call “the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/apr/02/brief-history-of-brylcreem" data-trackable="link">Brylcreem </a>days”. Jewellery workers were said to slather their hair with that pomade so that they could run their hands, covered in precious metal dust, through it, later retrieving the gold or silver. Mr Brittain has stories of such practices, and Winchester jeweller Jeremy France, whose twice-yearly sweeps at the workshop in his store yield between £6,000 and £8,000 a time, jokingly refers to an industry expression that “we don’t employ people with sweaty hands or turned-up trousers,” both ideal for accumulating valuable dust.</p>
<p>Four flights above the jewellery boutique of <!-- -->David Morris <!-- -->on Bond Street, polisher Dave Wadeson, who has been in the business for 40 years, says he once saw floorboards glittering in a workshop when he was an apprentice.</p>
<p>“When [the workshop] was taken over by Bentley &amp; Skinner, they took up all the floorboards and the amount of lemel embedded in them was incredible — they found piles of fine grain around the edges,” he says.</p>
<p>When Mr Williams worked at wedding ring manufacturer Brown &amp; Newirth, the business moved workshops around 1990 and dismantled its five-storey wooden staircase, which was so impregnated with precious metal that it looked like the “glitter in a marble kitchen top”. It turned out to be worth tens of thousands of pounds — enough to pay for a new staircase and the workshop’s moving costs.</p>
<p>And at Cooksongold, which claims to be the UK’s largest precious metals refiner, processing 25,000 jobs a year, Mr Wibberley recalls when a parquet floor in its own factory was ripped up and the precious metals embedded in the wood made it worth £20 per sq m.</p>
<p>Large jobs like burning floorboards, carpets or benches tend to happen when a jeweller is moving premises or upgrading. There are less extreme options for the interim, such as specialist vacuuming services or sanding down the top layer of benches and processing the wood dust. The challenge is picking up the day-to-day waste, and it is an art that is being constantly refined — particularly by larger manufacturers with the most to gain.</p>

<p>New technology being introduced to these factories is actually increasing waste, requiring even greater efforts to capture it. One British jewellery manufacturer, which did not wish to be named, has invested in sealed milling machines fitted with vacuums to capture the coils and swarf (sawdust-like chips of precious metal) they dispatch at high speeds. Each has a filter that can separate materials as thin as a micron — much narrower than a human hair.</p>
<p>In Birmingham’s Jewellery Quarter is Hockley Mint, a British jewellery manufacturer with a turnover of £12m that produces up to 140,000 pieces a year. Gathering scrap and lemel at its 30,000 sq ft factory requires daily cleaning and collecting, as well as the use of localised vacuums. “One of the things we have put in place that is relatively new is that when workers wash their hands we save the paper towels they dry with,” says managing director Gary Wroe.</p>
<p>“We got £2,000 back in a 12-month period just from the towels, and that goes straight on our bottom line.”</p>

<figure data-component="image-set"><picture><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A2f6e3480-d991-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A2f6e3480-d991-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=2 2x" width="2048" height="1152"><img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2f6e3480-d991-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1" alt="Gary Wroe MBA Managing Director of  Hockley Mint, Birmingham" data-image-type="image" width="2048" height="1152" loading="lazy"></picture><figcaption><span>Gary Wroe MBA Managing Director of  Hockley Mint, Birmingham</span><span> <!-- -->© Edward Moss</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Hockley Mint has also upgraded its windows so that blinds are now encased between panes of glass — their fabric panels were a magnet for precious metal dust — and it also has an on-site laundry to process workers’ clothes.</p>
<p>Its biggest investment in precious metal reclamation to date has been an incinerator, which it installed 18 months ago, to melt, but not process, its sweeps. “If you send a bag of material out, you don’t know what’s coming back,” says Mr Wroe, who adds that the value of precious metals it is collecting has increased since taking over its own incinerating.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>His concern is one shared by many in the industry. Looking at the accumulation of sludge from settlement tanks placed beneath sinks, grimy mop heads and all manner of other dirt and waste collected in a sweep, it is impossible to estimate how much money has accrued, although there are ways to guess.</p>
<p>Jewellers expect to lose metal during the production phase and so will plan for it. At David Morris, the target is a maximum loss of 5 per cent, although its craftsmen believe the working figure is 1 per cent or 2 per cent, providing a guide for what could be reclaimed.</p>

<p>Hockley Mint uses scales to give as accurate a forecast as possible. “We measure in and measure out, and keep records so we know approximately what we should get back,” says Mr Wroe.</p>
<p>For others, guesstimates are based on experience, and this can lead to friction between jeweller and refiner when discrepancies arise. “Some people have expectations based on history but they haven’t got a complete understanding of what’s going on,” says Mr Williams. The gold price might have changed, he suggests, or the weight of material being processed could be similar but the contents disparate. “In this industry, trust is a big factor,” he says.</p>
<p>But that trust goes both ways. Sweeps can take weeks to process and refiners will sometimes advance money based on the expected yield, which can give less scrupulous jewellers an opportunity to run a ruse. “I heard a story about a sweep where the processor took the job, gave the customer an advance based on history and when they looked in the sweep bag, the bottom of it was newspapers,” says Mr Williams. </p>
<p>Cooksongold offers its clients advances at its trade counters in London and Birmingham. The business is part of the German Heimerle + Meule group and much of its refining is done at the group’s plants in Spain and Germany. This adds to the processing time, so it will do a pre-melt in London to ascertain what it is sending to Heimerle + Meule.</p>
<p>Processing its own pre-melted metal would be the next stage in Hockley Mint’s reclamation journey, but it is one that Mr Wroe has yet to commit to. “That’s a different skill and we’d have to bring the expertise in, so we’d have to work out whether it would be worth it.”</p>
<p>While Mr Wroe’s approach to reclamation is far more advanced than many other workshops, he is nonetheless resigned to the fact that he will never catch it all. “We have sticky mats at the doors to get the dust off people’s shoes as they leave the building, otherwise the streets of Hockley would be paved with gold,” he sighs. “And the council should definitely check the sewers.”    </p>

            <guid>40972099</guid>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/dicksites/KUtrace">https://github.com/dicksites/KUtrace</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40972099">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><pre>KUtrace is an extremely low-overhead Linux kernel tracing facility for observing all 
the execution time on all cores of a multi-core processor, nothing missing, while running 
completely unmodified user programs written in any computer language. It has been used in 
live datacenters (x86 processors) and in real-time autonomous driving (ARM processors) 
to understand long-standing performance mysteries. The design goal of KUtrace is to 
reveal the root cause(s) of unexpected delayed responses in real-time transactions or 
database processing while having such low overhead that it does not distort the system 
under test.

This March 2022 update COMPLETELY REPLACES the previous 2019 repository.

The directory contains files associated with the 2022 book 
Understanding Software Dynamics by Richard L. Sites, ISBN 978-0137589739.

The book-figures directory contains the underlying HTML files for over 100 of
the diagrams in the book, so you can wander around them to see more context or
to discover other performance issues. They work best in the Chrome browser.

The kutrace_user_guide.pdf file gives more detail and is more recent than the 
text in Chapter 19 of the book. Read it to fully use the HTML files.

The hello_world_trace.html file is an example trace of the hello_world_trace.c 
program found in book-user-code.

The book-user-code directory contains all the programs used in the book and the
script to compile them. They compile and run on both x86 and Rpi4 machines.

The linux_patches_installation_guide.pdf gives brief directions for building
the patches.

The loadable-module directory contains the source and Makefile for the companion
kernel module that implements the bulk of KUtrace. It builds for AMD and Intel 
x86 machines and for the Raspberry Pi4-B.

The patches-* files contain original source and patched source pairs of files
for adding KUtrace to three different versions of the Linux operating system.
These files are structured in the matching directories of the original Linux 
source download. The patches-linux-5.10.46-rpi4 folder contains additional 
documentation and useful scripts for building a patched kernel for any of
these three versions or for incorporating the patches into other versions. Only
64-bit versions of Linux are supported in this code; 32-bit ports of KUtrace 
are possible but difficult.

All the code is open sourced, most of it under the BSD three-clause license. The code specific to freebsd uses the BSD2 license, and the code specific to risc-v is licensed under GPL-2.0. The Linux loadable module(s) are required by Linux to be licensed under GPL-2.0.

Such costs are one reason that health care costs keep going up far above the rate of inflation.</p><p><span>Why was there such a big spread between the cost of buying the drug and the price being paid by payers? It wasn’t what most people expected, that the pharmaceutical company Novartis, had found a way to maintain its patents. The answer, according to a </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/07/ftc-releases-interim-staff-report-prescription-drug-middlemen" rel="">new Federal Trade Commission report</a><span>, is that a small group of middlemen were inflating the price. </span></p><p>These middlemen are called pharmacy benefit managers, and what they are supposed to do is clerical work. When a pharmacy dispenses medicine, it sends the claim to a PBM, which bills the insurer and patient and remits the pharmacist money. But because of a legal change I’ll explain, just three PBMs are now in control of pricing of pharmaceuticals, and are redirecting vast amounts of money to themselves. And they are why the price of generic Gleevec didn’t drop as it should have.</p><p><span>In fact, the concerned executive worked at the parent company of one of these PBMs. He was not worried about the price, but that such a price would look bad, and possibly violate the law. “We've created plan designs to aggressively steer customers to home delivery where the drug cost is ~200 times higher,” he wrote. If you went to Costco, he went on to say, the cost was $97, so the plan didn’t recommend patients go there. If a patient went to Walgreens, which the plan did recommend, it was $9000. And if a patient chose home delivery via the PBMs own mail order pharmacy, it was $19,200. “The optics are not good and must be addressed,” he added. He didn’t need to say that the added revenue for PBMs, just for that one drug, was $902.1 million over a few years. Another drug studied by the FTC, one for prostate cancer called Zytiga, was similarly inflated by an extra $685 million. That’s $1.6 billion for the two of them. Think about all the drugs used in our healthcare system, and that will give you a sense of why healthcare costs keep going up. (Yes, each inflated drug cost is </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/economic-termites-are-everywhere" rel="">an economic termite</a><span>.)</span></p><p>Most people think of high pharmaceutical prices, and blame the companies you’d expect in Big Pharma. These firms, with storied names like Merck, Pfizer, Novartis, Genentech, etc, are powerful, and they are in the business of developing and selling drugs. But this other group, corporations you haven’t heard of, composed entirely of middlemen, price and handle payment for pharmaceuticals between doctors, pharmacies, and patients, are perhaps equally important, if not more so. And unlike pharmaceutical companies, who actually employ doctors and scientists, PBMs don’t do anything difficult. They keep lists.</p><p><span>PBMs are </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-red-wedding-for-rural-pharmacies" rel="">a topic</a><span> I’ve covered, mostly as a cause of the disappearance of rural independent pharmacies, but last week, the FTC sparked a big political fight by releasing </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/07/ftc-releases-interim-staff-report-prescription-drug-middlemen" rel="">this report</a><span> on the PBM business model. Chair Lina Khan did so with support from one Republican commissioner, Andrew Ferguson, but opposition from another, Melissa Holyoak. The FTC also indicated in the report’s final pages, and the Wall Street Journal </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/ftc-to-sue-drug-managers-over-insulin-prices-b46af71f?mod=hp_lead_pos4" rel="">noted</a><span>, that it was likely to sue PBMs over the high prices they foster for insulin, which could potentially change the entire drug claims system, and bring down prices dramatically. </span></p><p><span>To understand the world of pharma pricing, we have to start at the beginning. In the 1950s and 1960s, pharmaceutical development exploded, as did the health insurance industry. Insurers needed a way to help their patients to easily buy them the new cornucopia of drugs at pharmacies. Enter pharmacy benefit managers, who were claims processors that issued a plastic card to insurance customers, got pharmacies to accept those cards, and tracked the money flows, including reimbursements. PBMs were very similar to Visa and Mastercard, with the very first PBM actually called “</span><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdvancePCS" rel="">Pharmaceutical Card System</a><span>.”</span></p><p>PBMs soon started to create what are called drug formularies, which are lists of drugs payers will cover, specifying the kind of drugs included and the cost-sharing arrangements. They also put together networks of pharmacies, and began helping design strategies to encourage patients to take the correct medicine for the lowest price, known as utilization management. It was a business to business service. If you’re an employer, a union, a state or Federal government program, and you need drug benefits for a group, you hire a PBM and they set you up with a range of formularies and pharmacy networks. Today, commercial health plans, Medicare drug plans, Medicaid managed care, and affiliated health insurers use PBMs.</p><p><span>But then, several changes shifted the business model. The first was consolidation. From the 1980s to the 2000s, PBMs consolidated both horizontally and vertically, so each big PBM is now owned by a major healthcare conglomerate. CVS owns&nbsp;Caremark, Cigna has Express Scripts and UnitedHealth Group (UHG) runs Optum Rx. (For a case study, see my 2020 piece called “</span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/how-cvs-became-a-health-care-tyrant" rel="">How CVS Became a Health Care Tyrant</a><span>.”) There were big acquisitions, like Express Scripts buying Medco in 2012 and CVS buying Aetna in 2018, but smaller ones as well. “According to PitchBook,” the FTC report noted, “these four entities and their subsidiaries (which include the largest PBMs) collectively engaged in more than 190 transactions over the 2016 to 2023 period (UHG, 88; CVS, 53; Humana, 39; and Cigna, 14).”</span></p><p>UHG, for instance, is one of the top PBMs, but it also employs 10% of the doctors in America, is America’s biggest health insurer, runs Optum Bank through which bailout funds during Covid flowed to hospitals, and even owns Change Health, the large payment network for hospitals and pharmacies. More importantly, the big PBMs, while they contract with independent pharmacies, also own their own retail and mail-order pharmacies, thus setting the reimbursement rates for themselves and their competitors. (UHG is a frequent target of medical comedian Dr Glaucomflecken.)</p><div id="youtube2-_khH6pZnHCM" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;_khH6pZnHCM&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;1s&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_khH6pZnHCM?start=1s&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>The other change was the legalization of price discrimination, which fostered an era of secretive pricing. </p><p><span>PBMs had been clerical agents, paid by insurers to negotiate with drug makers, or on a per transaction basis to handle transactions. But in 1987, Congress passed an </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/02/2020-26072/medicare-and-state-health-care-programs-fraud-and-abuse-revisions-to-safe-harbors-under-the" rel="">exemption</a><span> to a Medicare Anti-Kickback statute, which created a safe harbor for group buying entities to accept payment from drug manufacturers in the form of rebates, with certain guardrails in place. Enabling kickbacks created a clear conflict of interest, since a PBM is supposed to be negotiating for the buyer, but could now be paid by the seller. The second change was an antitrust </span><a href="https://foleyhoag.com/getattachment/d63b4cbe-7427-49f4-becb-63b6130362fd/FOLEY-HOAG-LLP-WHITEPAPER-Antitrust-Implications-of-a-Proposed-HHS-Rule-to-Limit-Manufacturer-Rebates.pdf?lang=en-US" rel="">suit in 1994</a><span>, where pharmacies sued to get the same discounts for drugs offered to health insurance plans and hospitals. In the settlement of that case, the parties and the judge said that if a buyer was big enough that it could prove it could shift market shares, it was entitled to a secret rebate. And the third was in 1999 when the government used its authority to explicitly say that rebates were permissible legal discounts. Today’s system, where PBMs get large secret rebates in return for allocating market shares, was born. </span></p><p>Today, it’s virtually impossible to get any clear pricing on most drugs, because there is no one price. There are different benchmarks, for instance the one I used above to describe what manufacturers get for selling Gleevec. But there are other benchmarks depending on who you are, such as average wholesale price (AWP), wholesale acquisition cost (WAC), Average Sales Price (ASP), Average Manufacturer Price (AMP), Maximum Allowable Cost (MAC), Usual and Customary (U&amp;C), etc, each of which means something different, and many of which are arbitrary mark-ups designed to make it looks like there are discounts when there aren’t, or to extract extra money from pharmacists or patients.</p><p>Many drug pricing contracts use several of these benchmarks, along with rebates, reimbursements, and fees that are sometimes assessed six months after a point of sale transaction goes through. The endless number of such adjustments make it impossible to know what anything costs. Just one PBM, for instance, has over ten thousand different price lists for drug reimbursement rates, sometimes updated daily, which means the price of a particular drug depends on who you are, when you bought it, other drugs you might have purchased, or what the PBM executive had for lunch. </p><p>Pharmacists are often not allowed to look at the price they would be given for reimbursement prior to submitting a claim because, as one PBM manual notes, "price lists are the PBMs confidential and proprietary information." There are often multiple prices for the same transaction. A drug might seem like it costs $100 at the point of sale for a drug that cost the pharmacist $50, where the patient would pay a $60 copay and the insurer paid $40. But then six months later the PBM will claw back $75 from the pharmacist in what’s called a DIR fee. In that case, because of the copay, the insurer/PBM is actually extracting money from both the patient whose medical costs it should be covering, and the pharmacy it should be reimbursing. The whole system is insane . </p><p>Price discrimination and consolidation weren’t separate phenomena, but drove each other. In fact, if a PBM had to charge the same price for its service to all comers, then it would not matter if a PBM were big; a drug manufacturer negotiating with a PBM would have to give the same price, regardless of size. It also wouldn’t make sense to own its own pharmacy, nor could it charge different amounts for cancer drugs and keep the difference. But the legalization of price discrimination changed the market. And today, there’s really no way to convey how weird this world of pricing is, except that it feels Soviet and arbitrary to everyone in it. </p><p>The legislation of price discrimination happened in areas beyond PBMs and health care, it is perhaps the biggest victory of the law and economic school, and certainly one of the most important legal shifts in our society in the last fifty years, far more impactful than most of the economic fights we hear about.</p><p>Before the 1980s, it had been a fundamental axiom of America that everyone gets access to the same publicly posted price for the same class of service or good. Grangers fought for this principle in the 1870s, populists in the 1880s, business and labor leaders at the 1899 conference on trusts agreed on it even though they disagreed on everything else, it was understood as part of the Sherman Act in 1890, explicitly embedded into the Clayton Act in 1914, written into the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, and across dozens of statutes across state and Federal government, from railroad to shipping to electric utility rules. </p><p><span>I mean, even the conservative Heritage Foundation advising the Reagan administration in 1981 decried secret rebates and discounting to select customers. “These kinds of discounts seem contrary,” </span><a href="https://www.jcampbell.com/docs-campbell/articles/1981_Mandate_for_Leadership.pdf" rel="">it said</a><span>, “to basic American precepts of justice, as they would “effectively end the value of publicly posted prices” and “favor the large organized interests with competitive alternatives at the expense of the unorganized, uneducated, or captive.” That’s the main policy recommendation to the most conservative Republican President since Herbert Hoover. </span></p><p><span>But starting in the 1970s, economists decided that price discrimination, far from problematic, was actually </span><em>efficient. </em><span>Indeed, if you could charge a high price to the rich, and a low price to the poor, then price discrimination could also be </span><em>progressive. </em><span>What could be wrong with selective discounting, after all? It turns out, plenty, and if you want to understand why, just look at PBMs.</span></p><p>Today, as a result of these changes, PBMs are big. Really big. The parent insurance companies of the biggest PBMs top nearly $1 trillion in revenue annually, roughly 4% of the GDP of America. Just the top four equal 22% of national healthcare expenditures, up from 14% in 2016. And no other country has anything like the PBM industry. The revenue of American PBMs is larger than what France spends on its entire healthcare system.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png" width="865" height="422" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:422,&quot;width&quot;:865,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:82663,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The top three PBMs have immense market power. While it looks like an oligopoly, PBMs have monopolies in certain areas. OptumRx, for instance, runs 83% of the South Carolina retail pharmacy network management services, while a different PBM has 85% of the market in Alabama. If you are a company or union that needs to buy prescription drugs or if you are a pharmacist that dispenses prescriptions, you have to run on their rails.</p><p>And they use their size and bulk to thwart rivals. They use information from their insurance arms to conduct marketing campaigns targeting patients of rival pharmacists. They make it easier to buy drugs if you buy them from their mail order pharmacy, a practice known as steering, they impose endless fees on pharmacies, and they also take kickbacks from pharmaceutical manufacturers to steer their patients to more expensive medication and cut off access to cheaper generics. They also go after rival PBMs, with the FTC noting that “Some health insurers reportedly do not permit their clients to comparison shop for PBM services; rather, the client must use the PBM affiliated with the health insurer.” (The giant PBMs also have exclusive contracts with certain pharmaceutical makers, which means that if you don’t use those PBMs you just can’t get critical medicines.) </p><p>The net effect is higher prices. Here, for instance, is a rebate contract for Sanofi’s Lantus, a popular branded insulin. The list price might be high, but that’s not all going to Sanofi. In fact, 63% of that was going to the PBM in the form of a rebate, as long as Lantus is the only insulin offered to the patient. In other words, there’s competition, but not to lower prices to the consumer, but to pay higher rebates to the PBM.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png" width="692" height="622" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:622,&quot;width&quot;:692,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:331850,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>It’s not just insulin, of course. Take the most expensive drug historically in America by aggregate revenue, Humira, which made over $22 billion for AbbVie in 2022. It recently lost its patent protection, and there are several generics, known as ‘biosimilars,’ coming into the market. Several drug manufacturers (Coherus, Sandoz, Boehringer Ingelheim, etc.) invested in developing biosimilars to launch when the Humira patent expired.&nbsp; These drugs brought the sticker price of the drug down 10x from $80,000 per year to as low as $8,000 per year.</p><p>But none of these are able to get onto the shelf. Instead, what happened is that CVS started a drug manufacturing company called Cordavis to sell Humira biosimilars to its specialty pharmacy (CVS Specialty). They charge $1,300 per month, compared to some that are less than half that.&nbsp; Since CVS owns a PBM they controlled the formularies - and therefore the drug access - of between a fourth and third of Americans.&nbsp; They directed their PBM to preference their own drug through Cordavis and ignore the other biosimilars available on the market from smaller pharma companies, adding what I’m told is $50-100 million to CVS’s bottom line.</p><p>The negative impacts are twofold. First, consumers have to pay much more for the drug. Second, the pharma companies who invested to make biosimilars suffered financial losses. Here’s the share price of Coherus, which makes a Humira biosimilar.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png" width="1020" height="454" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:454,&quot;width&quot;:1020,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:92975,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>That means we won’t see any more biosimilar R&amp;D anymore, because everyone knows that PBMs will block them from the market. </p><p><span>For decades, PBMs operated in the shadows. But the passage of Obamacare changed the dynamic of health care, because it capped the profits of health insurance companies. To get out from under this cap, insurers began vertically integrating into different areas, and in the 2010s, every major PBM turned into an arm of a conglomerate. (See “</span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/how-obamacare-created-big-medicine" rel="">How Obamacare Created Big Medicine</a><span>”.) Today, there’s an acronym that describes who controls health care. It’s BUCAH, meaning Blue Cross Blue Shield, UHG, Cigna, Aetna and Humana.</span></p><p>And employers started getting angry at high prices. Mark Cuban, for instance, started a pharmacy called Cost Plus Drugs, and is running a high-profile campaign against PBMs.</p><p><span>More importantly, a group in Ohio, a random Wall Street quant named Eric Pachman, a pharmacy lobbyist named Antonio Ciaccia, and a pharmacist named Ben Link began playing around with public pricing data, and realized that government Medicaid programs were getting ripped off by hundreds of billions of dollars a year by PBMs for no reason. They started an organization called </span><a href="https://www.46brooklyn.com/" rel="">46 Brooklyn</a><span>, and their research has led to changes in dozens of states. </span></p><p><span>In 2021, for instance, Kentucky got rid of its use of big PBMs in Medicaid, and </span><a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2023/10/05/reprieve-for-kentuckys-independent-pharmacies-is-saving-medicaid-millions/" rel="">saved</a><span> $285 million out of $1.2 billion its program spent on prescription drugs. It even led to an attempt by the Trump administration to get rid of the ability of PBMs to engage in certain forms of secret rebating.

And there have been dozens of PBM-related hearings - the </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/health-care-policy/2024/07/09/pbm-execs-testify-july-23" rel="">next one</a><span> is on July 23 with the CEOs of the ExpressScript, OptumRX, and Caremark - and Congress is closer to passing PBM legislation than it has ever been. </span></p><p><span>For decades, the FTC, far from helping, was on the wrong side of the argument. Its economists had promoted the idea that price discrimination and rebates were good, that vertical integration made sense, that PBM consolidation would help consumers, and that a PBM owning a mail order pharmacy was not a conflict of interest, but was efficient. But in 2021, then-FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1590528/statement_of_commissioner_rohit_chopra_regarding_the_commissions_report_on_pharmacy_benefit_manager.pdf" rel="">shocked</a><span> the commission by attacking his own agency, saying “There is a growing consensus that the Federal Trade Commission’s approach… is not working.” In 2022, the FTC put out a </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/corporate-bribery-just-became-illegal" rel="">policy statement</a><span> saying that the use of rebates by dominant middlemen in the insulin market were a potential legal violation. It also launched the investigation that led to this report.</span></p><p>What’s interesting is that the report is not final, because PBMs would not submit the information the FTC subpoena’d. In fact, some of the PBMs said they would send certain documentation until 2025. It’s a clear run out the clock strategy. The FTC could sue the PBMs to get this information, but it’s not clear that would be faster, and it would eat up litigation resources. And there’s good original information in the report, including the cancer drug analysis overpayment story, which is based on raw claims data. Normally, the commission waits until it has completed its analysis to publish a report, but in this case, the FTC sought to release the interim analysis and publicly name the PBMs as operating as bad faith actors for withholding information. </p><p><span>The politics then flipped. The vote to release the report was 4-1, with the three Democrats seeking to put it out, along with Republican FTC Commissioner Andrew Ferguson. Ferguson not only </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Ferguson-Statement-Pharmacy-Benefit-Managers-Report.pdf" rel="">voted</a><span> to release the report, but said that the FTC should have sued, arguing they weren’t being aggressive enough. His colleague Melissa Holyoak, however, </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/holyoak-statement-on-pharmacy-benefit-managers-report" rel="">dissented</a><span>, and said the report needed economic analysis to show that consumer prices were affected. It was a standard U.S. Chamber of Commerce process-troll, and Holyoak likely thought she would get plaudits for opposing Lina Khan. Instead, at a Congressional hearing, multiple Republican members were annoyed with her, including Rep.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.vincentschmalbach.com/google-now-defaults-to-not-indexing-your-content/">https://www.vincentschmalbach.com/google-now-defaults-to-not-indexing-your-content/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40970987">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Picture this: It's ten years ago, and you've just launched a new WordPress blog. Within hours, sometimes even minutes, your content is indexed by Google. You search for a unique sentence from your latest post, and there it is, right on the first page of Google. It felt like magic, didn't it?</p>
<p>This was Google living up to its mission: "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible." For users, it meant that if the information existed somewhere on the web, a bit of clever searching would unearth it. For content creators, it was a golden opportunity: create content, and Google will make sure it's found.</p>
<h2>The SEO Arms Race and Google's Response</h2>
<p>But where there's opportunity, there's also exploitation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-quality content flooding the web</li>
<li>Link buying and selling</li>
<li>Lots of grey and black hat SEO stuff</li>
</ul>
<p>Google introduced a series of algorithm updates, each more sophisticated than the last. Panda, Penguin, and their successors aimed to clean up what Google saw as manipulative SEO practices.</p>
<p>This wasn't a one-time event, but more like a two-decade-long dance between SEOs and Google. Each side continually adapted, with Google rolling out updates and SEOs finding new ways to optimize within (and sometimes outside) the guidelines.</p>
<h2>The Rise and Fall of "Content is King"</h2>
<p>Amid this ongoing battle between SEOs and Google, a new mantra emerged in the industry: "Content is King". This concept had two main aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Good content will naturally attract links and possibly generate positive user interaction signals, which could improve rankings.</li>
<li>Google's algorithms would inherently value and rank high-quality content.</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea was that by focusing on creating great content, websites could improve their SEO without resorting to more technical or potentially manipulative tactics.</p>
<p>However, this concept was never fully true. Many creators of genuinely good content never achieved the rankings they felt they deserved, showing that quality alone wasn't enough. At the same time, it wasn't entirely false either - good content did often perform well in search results.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental issues was that neither Google nor anyone else could algorithmically determine "good" content.</p>
<p>The mantra served as a useful simplification for SEOs and content creators, giving them a clear goal to aim for. It was also a convenient explanation for Google when SEOs delved too deeply into technical details - they could always fall back on "just create good content".</p>
<h2>The AI Content Revolution</h2>
<p>Fast forward to 2018. OpenAI releases GPT-1, and suddenly, the future of content creation becomes crystal clear. AI-generated content, indistinguishable from human-written text, is on the horizon. The "content is king" era is coming to an end.</p>
<h2>Google's Existential Crisis</h2>
<p>Now, put yourself in Google's shoes. You're facing a future where AI can generate infinite amounts of human-like content. What do you do?</p>
<p>Google's response was twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Promote the vague concept of E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness). In practice, this translates to favoring well-known brands and established websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abandon the mission of indexing everything. Instead, become selective. Very selective.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>The New Reality: Selective Indexing</h2>
<p>This brings us to the current state of affairs: Google is no longer trying to index the entire web. In fact, it's become extremely selective, refusing to index most content. This isn't about content creators failing to meet some arbitrary standard of quality. Rather, it's a fundamental change in how Google approaches its role as a search engine.</p>
<p>From my experience, Google now seems to operate on a "default to not index" basis. It only includes content in its index when it perceives a genuine need. This decision appears to be based on various factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extreme content uniqueness: It's not enough to write about something that isn't extensively covered. Google seems to require content to be genuinely novel or fill a significant gap in its index.</li>
<li>Perceived authority: Sites that Google considers highly authoritative in their niche may have more content indexed, but even then, it's not guaranteed.</li>
<li>Brand recognition: Well-known brands often see most of their content indexed, while small or unknown bloggers face much stricter selectivity.</li>
<li>Temporary indexing and de-indexing: In practice, Google often indexes new content quite quickly, likely to avoid missing out on breaking news or important updates. Soon after, Google may de-index the content, and it remains de-indexed thereafter. So getting initially indexed isn't necessarily a sign that Google considers your content valuable.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've observed this shift firsthand. In the past, when I set up a new domain, it would be indexed within an hour or faster, sometimes in seconds. This was true even for brand new domains with no mentions anywhere and no backlinks. When I searched for the title of one of those brand new blog posts or some unique sentence from the article, it would be right there on the first Google page.</p>
<p>Now, for each piece of content, Google decides if it's worth indexing, and more often than not, the answer seems to be "no." They might index content they perceive as truly unique or on topics that aren't covered at all. But if you write about a topic that Google considers even remotely addressed elsewhere, they likely won't index it. This can happen even if you're a well-respected writer with a substantial readership.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I've noticed that when content does manage to get indexed, it often ranks surprisingly well. It's as if the hurdle of getting indexed has become so high that once you clear it, you're already most of the way to ranking. However, getting to that point has become exponentially more difficult.</p>
<p>Importantly, this extreme selectivity isn't applied equally. Big, recognized brands often see most of their content indexed quickly, while small bloggers or niche websites face a much higher bar for inclusion. For these smaller players, it's not just about creating good content anymore – it's about convincing Google that your content is absolutely necessary for their index.</p>
<h2>The Consequences</h2>
<p>Google has transformed from a comprehensive search engine into something more akin to an exclusive catalog.</p>
<p>For users, it means that the information they're looking for might exist but remain undiscoverable through Google.</p>
<p>I'm sure that a vast amount of valuable content is being overlooked. Information that you might search for may never appear in Google's results. Not because it doesn't exist, but because Google has chosen not to include it.</p>
<p>For content creators, it presents a significant challenge: how do you gain visibility if Google refuses to index most of your content?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.typefox.io/blog/open-collaboration-tools-announcement/">https://www.typefox.io/blog/open-collaboration-tools-announcement/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40970621">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><header><p>Jul 10th 2024</p><div><p><img alt="Dr. Miro Spönemann" loading="lazy" width="0" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.typefox.io/avatars/miro.webp">Dr. Miro Spönemann</p><p><img alt="Mark Sujew" loading="lazy" width="0" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.typefox.io/avatars/mark.webp">Mark Sujew</p></div></header><div><h3>We are thrilled to unveil our latest open source project: Open Collaboration Tools.</h3>
<p>Itʼs a collection of libraries and tools for live-sharing of IDE contents, designed to boost remote teamwork with open technologies.</p>
<p>The basic idea is simple: one person starts a collaboration session as host and invites others to join.
The IDE extension distributes the contents of the hostʼs workspace and highlights text selections and cursor positions of other participants.
In parallel, they get together in their favorite meeting or chat app for immediate discussion.
All participants see what the others are looking at and and what changes they propose in real-time.
This way of remote collaboration reduces confusion and maximizes productivity.</p>
<p>In its first public release, Open Collaboration Tools is available with the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A VS Code Extension available on <a href="https://open-vsx.org/extension/typefox/open-collaboration-tools">Open VSX</a> and the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=typefox.open-collaboration-tools">VS Code Marketplace</a></li>
<li>An <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/13309">extension for Eclipse Theia</a></li>
<li>A server application for handling authentication and collaboration sessions, with a public instance available at <code>api.open-collab.tools</code></li>
<li>An open and extensible protocol with TypeScript libraries facilitating its integration in different environments</li>
<li>End-to-end encryption and extensible user authentication built-in right from the start</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, an integration with Monaco Editor will be available soon.
This unprecedented feature is particularly exciting because it enables fully customizable live collaboration between users of a web application or even between a website and a local IDE.
Finally youʼll be able to join a live-sharing session started from a full-fledged development environment, simply by opening a website link!</p>
<p>The initial version of Open Collaboration Tools focuses on plain text documents: source code of any programming language, Markdown documents, scripting languages, domain-specific languages, configuration formats, HTML and other markup languages, etc.
But the story doesnʼt end here – we are going to add support for other kinds of content creation such as Jupyter Notebooks, diagram editors, and more.
The underlying protocol and infrastructure is adaptible to numerous scenarios where real-time collaborative viewing and editing can be helpful.</p>
<h2>Motivation for new collaboration tools</h2>
<p>In our daily work with customers, we have seen the need for collaborative editing inside of IDEs over and over again.
While there are a few products out there aiming to provide collaborative editing experiences for their users, none of them were quite right for our customers.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at an exemplary use case: You are an engineer at a microchip design company.
You’re using a textual programming language to design chips. To improve productivity, you also have the option to use a graphical editor in your IDE to modify chip design files.
Given that these designs are highly sensitive, your company doesn’t want any information about them leaving the company network.
Now, you want to do some pair-programming with a coworker. What kind of tool can you choose to facilitate that?</p>
<p>To our dismay, nothing available fits that bill. What we need is a solution that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can be plugged into any popular IDE, ideally even support cross-IDE use cases.</li>
<li>Is designed to be extensible. Adding custom editors beyond just text can be done with reasonable effort.</li>
<li>Runs on premise to ensure absolute data security.</li>
<li>Does not bind you to a single vendor. A permissive license would be best to keep control of your tools.</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking at the 3 most popular collaborative editing tools, we will find that at least one of those requirements isn’t supported:</p>

</table>
<p>
<span>
    <sup id="footnote1">1</sup> The Microsoft proprietary license allows usage free of charge, but restricts the extension to run only in officially distributed Microsoft products (i.e. no VSCodium, Coder, Gitpod or Theia).
</span>
</p>
<p>Faced with this issue, we are now taking matters into our own hands.
This is why the Open Collaboration Tools project is designed with a few core principles in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>No vendor lock-in: Allow to potentially support any IDE and even your own web application.</li>
<li>Absolute extensibility: The underlying protocol can be extended to enable collaboration for any kind of editor.</li>
<li>Run wherever you like: Run the server infrastructure on any system, be it locally, on premise or in the cloud.</li>
<li>Open Source Licensing: The whole project is licensed under the <a href="https://opensource.org/license/mit">MIT License</a> and can be used by anyone, in any way they like.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Open Collaboration Protocol</h2>
<p>The technology to facilitate all of the above is the <em>Open Collaboration Protocol</em>.
This protocol specifies how the IDE is supposed to authenticate with a collaboration server, how to create or join a session, and what kind of data is exchanged between users within each session.</p>
<p>On a technical level, this is done via a <em>centralized peer-to-peer</em> mechanism.
Any user within a session can send an arbitrary notification or request to any other user.
Additionally, a broadcasting mechanism allows to send a message to all other users.
From a network perspective, each user only communicates to a central server.
It is used as a message broker that sends the messages to their respective targets.
As a consequence, the server is completely oblivious about the actual content of a message – and we can use that to our advantage.</p>
<p>This kind of brokering mechanism enables limitless extensibility of the protocol.
As long as the two communicating clients understand each other’s messages, they can work together.
For example, if I build an IDE with a built-in graphical editor, I just need to additionally send messages to synchronize edits across multiple users and handle any incoming synchronization messages.
The protocol already contains built-in support for basic text editors, with more to come soon!</p>
<h2>The big picture</h2>
<p>The new Open Collaboration Tools project fits perfectly into our overall strategy: to provide highly customizable tools and frameworks under permissive open source licenses.
TypeFox supports businesses to adapt the open source software to their needs and make the best possible use of it to maximize their productivity.</p>
<p>In the beginning, we mentioned that a public instance of Open Collaboration Tools is now available at <code>api.open-collab.tools</code>.
TypeFox offers this service with the intent to demonstrate the capabilities of our new project and to support open source communities with it.
However, we recommend all companies who wish to adopt this new technology to deploy their own instance of it, secured with their existing access restrictions.
<a href="https://www.typefox.io/contact/">Get in touch with us</a> if you’re interested about support for the customization, deployment and usage of collaboration servers.</p>
<p>We are committed to invest further into the Open Collaboration Tools and grow the number and depth of its integrations over time. In the meantime, please check out the new website at <a href="https://www.open-collab.tools/">www.open-collab.tools</a> and help us spread the word!</p>

<p>SCALE has several key innovations compared to other cross-platform GPGPU
solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCALE accepts CUDA programs as-is. No need to port them to another 
  language. This is true even if your program uses inline PTX <code>asm</code>.</li>
<li>The SCALE compiler accepts the same command-line options and CUDA dialect
  as <code>nvcc</code>, serving as a drop-in replacement.</li>
<li>"Impersonates" an installation of the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit, so existing 
  build tools and scripts like <code>cmake</code> <em>just work</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-projects-have-been-tested">What projects have been tested?<a href="#what-projects-have-been-tested" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>We validate SCALE by compiling open-source CUDA projects and running their
tests.
The following open-source projects are currently part of our nightly automated 
tests and pass fully:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/thrust">NVIDIA Thrust</a></li>

<h2 id="what-are-the-components-of-scale">What are the components of SCALE?<a href="#what-are-the-components-of-scale" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>SCALE consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <code>nvcc</code>-compatible compiler capable of compiling nvcc-dialect CUDA for AMD
  GPUs, including PTX asm.</li>
<li>Implementations of the CUDA runtime and driver APIs for AMD GPUs.</li>
<li>Open-source wrapper libraries providing the "CUDA-X" APIs by delegating to the
  corresponding ROCm libraries.
  This is how libraries such as <code>cuBLAS</code> and <code>cuSOLVER</code> are handled.</li>

<p>Instead of providing a <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">new way</a> to write GPGPU 
software, SCALE allows programs written using the widely-popular CUDA
language to be directly compiled for AMD GPUs.</p>
<p>SCALE aims to be fully compatible with NVIDIA CUDA. We believe that users 
should not have to maintain multiple codebases or compromise on performance
to support multiple GPU vendors.</p>
<p>SCALE's language is a <em>superset</em> of NVIDIA CUDA, offering some opt-in
<a href="https://docs.scale-lang.com/manual/language-extensions/">language extensions</a>
that can make writing GPU code easier and more efficient for users who wish
to move away from <code>nvcc</code>.</p>
<p>SCALE is a work in progress. If there is a missing API that is blocking your
attempt to use SCALE, please contact us so we can prioritise its development.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I hate flaky tests.</p>
<p>We repeatedly run our suite of tests during development time and on every commit, so if a test is flaky, developers quickly learn not to trust it. It’s so easy to just retry and assume everything is fine. This is the worst of both worlds because the test isn’t providing value as an indication that something needs to be fixed and it drags out the review-merge cycle with test reruns. </p>
<p>Across a modest-sized development team, even a test that flakes 1 in 100 will burn one of your devs every day on average.</p>
<p>Today we’re going to dive deep into one particular area that’s hard to get right: code that depends on time.</p>
<h2>Repeatability and Determinism</h2>
<p>If your code is supposed to do something at 8pm every day, you can’t just wait around until 8pm to test that it does the right thing. Similarly, if your code is supposed to do something after 30 minutes, you probably don’t want to wait 30 minutes to know if it’s working correctly.</p>
<p>One approach is to make the values “8pm” and “30 minutes” configurable, and choose them at test time. This can work, but it has drawbacks.</p>
<p>One is repeatability: the tests will be operating on different times each run, and on different times than they would in production. I’ve seen flakes related to daylight savings time and whether the test happens to start at zero minutes past the hour.</p>
<p>The second is determinism. Compress 30 minutes into 30ms and your tests may no longer do things in the order you expect, since consumer operating systems don’t make hard guarantees about real-time processing. Writing tests this way is an explicit balancing act between fast and flake-free execution. It’s hard to get right, especially since development environments tend to have fast hardware and not a lot of resource contention, whereas CI runs on constrained and shared hardware.</p>
<h2>Introducing Quartz</h2>
<p>Today we are <a href="https://github.com/coder/quartz" target="_blank">introducing Quartz</a>, a mocking library in Go for testing code that depends on time.</p>
<p>By mocking out calls that query or depend on the real time, we can write unit tests that are repeatable, deterministic, and execute as quickly as the CPU allows. This is, in itself, not a new idea. In building Quartz, we took some inspiration from:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson/clock" target="_blank">github.com/benbjohnson/clock</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/coder/tailscale/blob/main/tstest/clock.go" target="_blank">Tailscale's tstest.Clock</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspenmesh/tock" target="_blank">github.com/aspenmesh/tock</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Quartz shares the high level design of a Clock interface that closely resembles the functions in the time standard library, and a "real" clock passes through to the standard library in production, while a mock clock gives precise control in testing.</p>
<p>For several reasons, it is a tall order to write tests that are repeatable, deterministic and fast, when it comes to code that depends on time. The rest of this blog post will discuss what these reasons are and why we found these existing libraries insufficient. If you are just ready to dive into unit testing with Quartz, head over to the repository now and look at the <a href="https://github.com/coder/quartz?tab=readme-ov-file#readme" target="_blank">README</a> and <a href="https://github.com/coder/quartz/blob/main/example_test.go" target="_blank">examples</a>.</p>
<p>I also want to give a big thank you to the authors of the above libraries. Discussing the limitations of the libraries in the next sections is not meant to imply these libraries are bad or not useful. To the extent that Quartz surpasses these limitations, it is only by standing on their shoulders.</p>
<h2>Preventing Test Flakes</h2>
<p>The following example comes from the README from benbjohnson/clock:</p>
<pre><code>mock := clock.NewMock()
count := <span>0</span>

<span>// Kick off a timer to increment every 1 mock second.</span>
<span>go</span> <span><span>func</span><span>()</span></span> {
    ticker := mock.Ticker(<span>1</span> * time.Second)
    <span>for</span> {
        &lt;-ticker.C
        count++
    }
}()
runtime.Gosched()

<span>// Move the clock forward 10 seconds.</span>
mock.Add(<span>10</span> * time.Second)

<span>// This prints 10.</span>
fmt.Println(count)</code></pre>
<p>The first race condition is fairly obvious: moving the clock forward 10 seconds may generate 10 ticks on the <code>ticker.C</code> channel, but there is no guarantee that <code>count++</code> executes before <code>fmt.Println(count)</code>.</p>
<p>The second race condition is more subtle, but <code>runtime.Gosched()</code> is the tell. Since the ticker is started on a separate goroutine, there is no guarantee that <code>mock.Ticker()</code> executes before <code>mock.Add()</code>. <code>runtime.Gosched()</code> is an attempt to get this to happen, but it makes no hard promises. On a busy system, especially when running tests in parallel, this can flake, advance the time 10 seconds first, then start the ticker and never generate a tick.</p>
<p>Let's talk about how Quartz tackles these problems.</p>
<p>In our experience, an extremely common use case is creating a ticker then doing a 2-arm <code>select</code> with ticks in one and context expiring in another, i.e.</p>
<pre><code>t := time.NewTicker(duration)
<span>for</span> {
    <span>select</span> {
    <span>case</span> &lt;-ctx.Done():
        <span>return</span> ctx.Err()
    <span>case</span> &lt;-t.C:
        err := do()
        <span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
            <span>return</span> err
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>In Quartz, we refactor this to be more compact and testing friendly:</p>
<pre><code>t := clock.TickerFunc(ctx, duration, <span>do</span>)
<span>return</span> t.<span>Wait</span>()</code></pre>
<p>This affords the mock <code>Clock</code> the ability to explicitly know when processing of a tick is finished because it's wrapped in the function passed to <code>TickerFunc</code> (<code>do()</code> in this example).</p>
<p>In Quartz, when you advance the clock, you are returned an object you can <code>Wait()</code> on to ensure all ticks and timers triggered are finished. This solves the first race condition in the example.</p>
<p>(As an aside, we still support a traditional standard library-style <code>Ticker</code>. You may find it useful if you want to keep your code as close as possible to the standard library, or if you need to use the channel in a larger <code>select</code> block. In that case, you'll have to find some other mechanism to sync tick processing to your test code.)</p>
<p>To prevent race conditions related to the starting of the ticker, Quartz allows you to set "traps" for calls that access the clock.</p>
<pre><code>func <span>TestTicker</span>(t *testing.T) {
    mClock := quartz<span>.NewMock</span>(t)
    trap := mClock<span>.Trap</span>()<span>.TickerFunc</span>()
    defer trap<span>.Close</span>() <span>// stop trapping at end</span>
    go <span>runMyTicker</span>(mClock) <span>// async calls TickerFunc()</span>
    call := trap<span>.Wait</span>(context<span>.Background</span>()) <span>// waits for a call and blocks its return</span>
    call<span>.Release</span>() <span>// allow the TickerFunc() call to return</span>
    <span>// optionally check the duration using call.Duration</span>
    <span>// Move the clock forward 1 tick</span>
    mClock<span>.Advance</span>(<span>time</span>.Second)<span>.MustWait</span>(context<span>.Background</span>())
    <span>// assert results of the tick</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>Trapping and then releasing the call to <code>TickerFunc()</code> ensures the ticker is started at a deterministic time, so our calls to <code>Advance()</code> will have a predictable effect.</p>
<p>Take a look at <code>TestExampleTickerFunc</code> in <code>example_test.go</code> for a complete worked example.</p>
<h2>Complex Time Dependence</h2>
<p>Another difficult issue to handle when unit testing is when some code under test makes multiple calls that depend on the time, and you want to simulate some time passing between them.</p>
<p>A very basic example is measuring how long something took:</p>
<pre><code><span>var</span> measurement <span>time</span><span>.Duration</span>
go <span>func</span>(clock quartz.Clock) {
    start := clock<span>.Now</span>()
    <span>doSomething</span>()
    measurement = clock<span>.Since</span>(start)
}(mClock)

<span>// how to get measurement to be, say, 5 seconds?</span></code></pre>
<p>The two calls into the clock happen asynchronously, so we need to be able to advance the clock after the first call to <code>Now()</code> but before the call to <code>Since()</code>. Doing this with the libraries we mentioned above means that you have to be able to mock out or otherwise block the completion of <code>doSomething()</code>.</p>
<p>But, with the trap functionality we mentioned in the previous section, you can deterministically control the time each call sees.</p>
<pre><code>trap := mClock<span>.Trap</span>()<span>.Since</span>()
<span>var</span> measurement <span>time</span><span>.Duration</span>
go <span>func</span>(clock quartz.Clock) {
    start := clock<span>.Now</span>()
    <span>doSomething</span>()
    measurement = clock<span>.Since</span>(start)
}(mClock)

c := trap<span>.Wait</span>(ctx)
mClock<span>.Advance</span>(<span>5</span>*<span>time</span>.Second)
c<span>.Release</span>()</code></pre>
<p>We wait until we trap the <code>clock.Since()</code> call, which implies that <code>clock.Now()</code> has completed, then advance the mock clock 5 seconds. Finally, we release the <code>clock.Since()</code> call. Any changes to the clock that happen before we release the call will be included in the time used for the <code>clock.Since()</code> call.</p>
<p>As a more involved example, consider an inactivity timeout: we want something to happen if there is no activity recorded for some period, say 10 minutes in the following example:</p>
<pre><code>func (<span>i</span> *InactivityTimer) <span>Start</span>() {
    <span>i</span><span>.mu</span><span>.Lock</span>()
    defer <span>i</span><span>.mu</span><span>.Unlock</span>()
    next := <span>i</span><span>.clock</span><span>.Until</span>(<span>i</span><span>.activity</span><span>.Add</span>(<span>10</span>*<span>time</span>.Minute))
    t := <span>i</span><span>.clock</span><span>.AfterFunc</span>(next, <span>func</span>() {
        <span>i</span><span>.mu</span><span>.Lock</span>()
        defer <span>i</span><span>.mu</span><span>.Unlock</span>()
        next := <span>i</span><span>.clock</span><span>.Until</span>(<span>i</span><span>.activity</span><span>.Add</span>(<span>10</span>*<span>time</span>.Minute), <span>"inner"</span>)
        <span>if</span> next == <span>0</span> {
            <span>i</span><span>.timeoutLocked</span>()
            return
        }
        t<span>.Reset</span>(next)
    })
}</code></pre>
<p>All Quartz <code>Clock</code> functions, and functions on returned timers and tickers support zero or more string tags that allow traps to match on them.</p>
<pre><code>func <span>TestInactivityTimer_Late</span>(t *testing.T) {
    <span>// set a timeout on the test itself, so that if Wait functions get blocked, we don't have to</span>
    <span>// wait for the default test timeout of 10 minutes.</span>
    ctx, cancel := context<span>.WithTimeout</span>(<span>10</span>*<span>time</span>.Second)
    defer <span>cancel</span>()
    mClock := quartz<span>.NewMock</span>(t)
    trap := mClock<span>.Trap</span><span>.Until</span>(<span>"inner"</span>)
    defer trap<span>.Close</span>()

    it := &amp;InactivityTimer{
        activity: mClock<span>.Now</span>(),
        clock: mClock,
    }
    it<span>.Start</span>()

    <span>// Trigger the AfterFunc</span>
    w := mClock<span>.Advance</span>(<span>10</span>*<span>time</span>.Minute)
    c := trap<span>.Wait</span>(ctx)
    <span>// Advance the clock a few ms to simulate a busy system</span>
    mClock<span>.Advance</span>(<span>3</span>*<span>time</span>.Millisecond)
    c<span>.Release</span>() <span>// Until() returns</span>
    w<span>.MustWait</span>(ctx) <span>// Wait for the AfterFunc to wrap up</span>

    <span>// Assert that the timeoutLocked() function was called</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>This test case will fail with our bugged implementation, since the triggered AfterFunc won't call <code>timeoutLocked()</code> and instead will reset the timer with a negative number. The fix is easy, use <code>next &lt;= 0</code> as the comparison.</p>
<h2>Correspondence Principle</h2>
<p>One final criterion in designing Quartz’s API was the desire to be able to write unit tests that are easy to understand. </p>
<p>Time flows in one direction, from past to future, and I wanted unit tests written with Quartz to have the same monotonic flow and definite ordering. As you read a unit test from top to bottom, time advances forward, and you can define explicit breaks in the flow to inspect and assert the state of code under test, like breakpoints in debugger, or hitting the pause button while playing back a video.</p>
<p>Consider this example unit test from the Quartz repository. The color coding shows how time advances as the unit test executes.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/19109/1720191961-code-example.png"></p>
<p>From the perspective of the unit test function, the clock is always in a well defined state, and only changes state explicitly and synchronously.</p>
<p>The second ingredient for writing repeatable, deterministic unit tests is for the unit under test to be in a well defined state, with no races, when you make your test assertions. Quartz cannot guarantee this on its own, but it is designed to make this as easy as possible via</p>
<ol>
<li>Waiting for <code>Advance/AdvanceNext</code> calls to complete. When paired with <code>AfterFunc</code> and <code>TickerFunc</code>, this allows you to wait for the unit under test to complete its timeout or tick processing. You can then assert the results of that processing without any races.</li>
<li>Trapping calls into the Quartz library via the Clock interface, Timers and/or Tickers. These allow you to suspend execution of the unit under test at deterministic points, where you can make assertions or advance the clock.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two properties–clock in a well defined state, unit under test in a well defined state–mean that you can make test assertions without worry that they will flake. Polling (e.g. “Eventually”), sleeping, or calling runtime.Gosched() within your tests are all indications that your tests are not fully deterministic. It’s still possible to write tests that don’t flake this way, but it’s harder and you make trade-offs with speed.</p>
<h2>Present and Future of Quartz</h2>
<p>The current release is v0.1.0, reflecting the fact that we are not yet making an ironclad promise not to change the API before v1.0. I don’t anticipate any changes, but it seems premature to make that promise before Quartz sees much deployment outside of Coder.</p>
<p>Having used Quartz internally at Coder for some time, we feel it is stable enough for general, public use. Just don’t robotically upgrade the library without checking until we declare the v1.0 API, likely later this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/coder/quartz" target="_blank">Please give Quartz a try</a>. If you like it, star it! If you have any issues or feature requests, please write a GitHub issue on the repo.</p>

<p><span><sup>1</sup> You may retort that testing at different times of day and seasons of the year gives you more test coverage. For what it’s worth, both these flakes were test bugs related to computing the expected outputs, not product bugs. To the extent your code is sensitive to these factors, you want test cases for them, not the luck of the draw of when the test is run. That is, you don’t want to wait around until daylight savings time to know whether your code will work when it does.

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyj4emsl000q3b834ntpxpn2@published" data-word-count="76">One morning at the end of April 2023, Marcela Maus, a cancer researcher at Mass General in Boston, got a call from her colleague Bryan Choi. “He called me, and he’s like, ‘Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!’ And I’m like, ‘What is going on?’” Maus said. Choi, a neurosurgeon with the languid demeanor of a surfer, was not given to outbursts. Maus hung up the phone and hurried over to his office.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjoblv2000q3b83hsylc7ab@published" data-word-count="77">The day before, Choi and Maus had treated their first patient in a clinical trial for an aggressive brain cancer called glioblastoma, infusing genetically modified white blood cells directly into the fluid surrounding the brain. They had been up all night worrying, especially after the patient, a 74-year-old man, developed a fever. Choi had ordered an MRI. “We were not looking for the results,” he said. “We were trying to make sure that our patient was okay.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjoblwl000r3b83mml2cp5f@published" data-word-count="83">When Maus got to Choi’s office, images from the MRI were loading on his screen. They stared in wonder: The patient’s tumor, which a few days before had shown up on the scan as a bright blob the size of a strawberry, had almost entirely disappeared. No one had heard of that kind of regression in glioblastoma, especially not overnight. “My first instinct was that there was something wrong with the MRI scanner,” Choi said. But then the follow-up scans looked even better.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobly3000s3b83j2fzsj6o@published" data-word-count="63">Several weeks later, they treated a second patient, a civil engineer from upstate New York named Tom Fraser, and the process repeated itself: the infusion, the fever, and the rapid regression of the tumor. “It was almost like clockwork,” Maus said, still sounding astonished months later. After a third patient had a similar response, she paused the trial and wrote up her results.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobm0q000t3b83rl3h29nm@published" data-word-count="67">Glioblastoma is the most common type of malignant brain cancer. It can strike at any age, and it’s uniformly fatal. Patients are often diagnosed in the emergency room after the tumor causes some somatic catastrophe, such as seizure, sudden loss of speech, or an inability to control the limbs on one side of the body. The median time from diagnosis to death is just over a year.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobm2z000u3b83cmlz7byg@published" data-word-count="107">The first step in treating the disease hasn’t changed in decades: “maximal safe resection,” a surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible while preserving neurological function. Because glioblastoma is so adept at infiltrating the brain, the surgeon almost always leaves cancer behind, which quickly starts growing again. Some patients respond to radiation or the chemotherapy drug temozolomide, but even that adds months rather than years to the average survival time. Roger Stupp, an expert in glioblastoma (he wrote the paper that made temozolomide “standard of care”), told me the disease had proved to be “a graveyard of ideas.” Decades of research have gone nowhere.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobm4n000v3b83cycggo54@published" data-word-count="64">Within the past 20 years, however, a once unfashionable field called immunotherapy has upended all expectations in oncology. It proceeds from a simple premise: The human immune system is very good at attacking anything it registers as disease. If it could be turned against cancer, it could eliminate a tumor more thoroughly than a surgeon’s knife and more durably than the poison of chemotherapy.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobm6k000w3b838t8ihiu3@published" data-word-count="100">Maus and Choi thought they’d found a way to do just that using the immune system’s all-purpose killer: the T cell, which the body sends to neutralize pathogens of all sorts, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites, but not (usually) cancer. By extracting T cells from a patient’s blood, editing the cells’ DNA in a lab, and reintroducing them at the site of the tumor, they had gotten the body to react to cancer as it would to a virus and destroy it. It was the culmination of years of research in immunotherapy labs like the one Maus runs at Mass General.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobm82000x3b83hqlqkxqx@published" data-word-count="71">Fraser remembers that on the day of his infusion, the room was crowded with doctors, nurses, and scientists. There was a sense, he said, that history was being made. “I felt a little poke when the needle was inserted,” he wrote me in an email, “but it was a very quick process.” Twenty-four days later, he walked out of the hospital, weak and exhausted but with his tumor in near-total remission.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobm9p000y3b83cee4xq8e@published" data-word-count="70">“There’s been a revolution in understanding cancer and the tools to tackle it,” Daniel Haber, the director of the Mass General Cancer Center, told me. Immunotherapy, paired with our greater understanding of the genetics of cancer cells, has produced breakthroughs for previously untreatable forms of the disease, especially in liquid tumors like leukemia and lymphoma and skin cancers like melanoma. Death sentences have been commuted; hopeless cases have been cured.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmbk000z3b8313t6r5d6@published" data-word-count="77">Until recently, the biggest exception to this parade of good news has been in solid tumors like pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma, which have resisted almost all efforts to check them. So Fraser had it right. If these early results from Boston held, it would make history. If we can treat glioblastoma — perhaps the hardest case in a field made up of hard cases — there’s not a cancer that would seem to be out of reach.</p>

  

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmhz00113b83efyfpqwx@published" data-word-count="54">After Choi and Maus published their results in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> in March, they heard from oncologists all over the world. “They’re desperate, and they say, ‘We want to offer something because there’s just nothing out there,’” Choi told me. The status quo, Choi knew from his own patients, was miserable.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmjx00123b83g71y2gl7@published" data-word-count="94">This spring, I got to witness the kind of brain surgery that’s standard of care for glioblastoma but may one day become obsolete. It was both simple and high-tech. Five figures in blue scrubs stood around the patient, and there were screens on every wall stacked like amps at a death-metal show. I was led around the operating table, ducking between machines until I arrived at the patient’s head, where the surgeon showed me how he could insert a stereotactic probe and see on the monitor exactly where in the brain he was working.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobml900133b83r0qn8t3y@published" data-word-count="93">A square of scalp on the patient’s head was peeled back to reveal the skull underneath. A smaller area of skull, about the size of an eye patch, had been removed, and the brain itself sat exposed, pulsing with each heartbeat, as if it were breathing. And it was: The engine of cognition, the seat of human consciousness, the anthropocentric core of the universe lay before us, and it was alive, fragile and yet somehow bursting with vitality, like it wanted nothing more than to leap free of the vessel that contained it.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmmt00143b830e7wgy6a@published" data-word-count="57">On a screen on the far wall, I could see a hole where the tumor had been, an almost perfectly round miniature planet. I switched my gaze to look at the brain directly. The hole was darker than I would have imagined. I tried to stare all the way into its bottom but could see only black.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmp700153b835jcwa7vr@published" data-word-count="81">Patients with glioblastoma are often sent to surgery within days of their diagnosis. The urgency comes both from the aggressiveness of the disease and the unique nature of the brain itself. Trapped inside the skull, there’s nowhere for it to go when a tumor begins growing. As normal tissue is pushed aside, the neurological effects can multiply quickly. Cancer elsewhere in the body can be debilitating, but it’s unlikely to suddenly take away your ability to speak, to move, to think.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmqt00163b83sc9z8t3e@published" data-word-count="92">Maus and her team started enrolling new trial participants in May. Hundreds of people with glioblastoma have written to or called Mass General about the study, but Maus had room for only 18 more. I asked her whether they had already filled the remaining spots. She said they couldn’t: Until recently, her team could treat only one patient at a time, and the disease progresses too quickly to look more than a few months into the future. “It’s heartbreaking,” Maus said about having to turn people away. “You get a lot of stories.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmv100173b83wgkctn6r@published" data-word-count="119">Not long ago, I spoke with Katie McKay, whose husband, Kevin, was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2016. That summer, Katie and Kevin were driving down for a vacation in Myrtle Beach with their two children, ages 3 and 5. They had made good time from their home in Annapolis, so Kevin phoned the hotel and asked if they could check in early. Shortly after he hung up, he began convulsing and moaning. The kids were watching cartoons in the back seat, “and they thought he was playing a joke on them, like being like a monster, and I thought so too,” Katie said. “I grabbed his arm, and I realized his eyes were in the back of his head.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobn0l00183b83hmvgnill@published" data-word-count="62">Katie pulled to the side of the road and Kevin’s head fell in her lap. He was out for several minutes, during which he soiled himself. When he woke up, Katie was standing outside the passenger side of the car checking his pulse. “He’s like, ‘Katie, what are you doing?’ And I said, ‘Nothing, everything’s fine. Something seems a little off with you.’”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobna200193b832zrc4i3g@published" data-word-count="102">At the hospital in Myrtle Beach, doctors saw two lesions on his brain. Kevin had his first surgery on August 2, at Johns Hopkins, and began radiation and chemotherapy. When Katie recounts the months that followed, her voice falters as she remembers how difficult their lives became. She kept spreadsheets of appointments and medications and leads to follow for novel treatments. “I started researching because I remember in the beginning going to a lot of the appointments and not knowing the lingo,” she said. “And I didn’t want to waste any more time asking somebody, ‘Can you tell me what they were talking about?’”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobnbr001a3b83x7f1dizi@published" data-word-count="57">Katie and Kevin were college sweethearts. They met at the University of Maryland and married in 2010. He was so lovable, Katie said. He liked to play little pranks on the family: dropping habanero in Katie’s drink when she wasn’t watching or waking his mother-in-law up with a leaf blower. He was 32 when he was diagnosed.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobndf001b3b83qof7zqbd@published" data-word-count="114">Kevin remained optimistic even as the disease progressed, while Katie remained, in her words, the worrywart. “In the beginning,” she said, “I would cry and be so sad and have so much anxiety about it, worrying about his fate, and he would be like, ‘Hey, Katie, if not us, it would be somebody else.’” Eventually, he had to step back from his job as an engineer, and Katie had to drive him everywhere while trying to manage the kids’ schedules. She enrolled him in a trial at Johns Hopkins, but it didn’t seem to have much of an effect. He lost the ability to sense his left side. Soon, he could no longer speak.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobnf3001c3b83burfmkge@published" data-word-count="78">Kevin died in July 2018, two years after his first seizure. As the tumor spread throughout his brain, he qualified for a trial at MD Anderson Cancer Center, but Katie decided against it: “He was already in a wheelchair. He was in a diaper at that point, and I could not feasibly get him there.” She said she’d rather spend her final weeks with him at home than subject him to a treatment that likely would not work.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobnsl001e3b83skvrdl5p@published" data-word-count="61">When Maus started her Ph.D. in immunology a little more than 25 years ago, the idea that it could one day make brain tumors like Kevin’s disappear was laughable. “I was told that it was career suicide,” Maus said. “People had been trying for a hundred years to get the immune system to recognize cancer, and it was a dead end.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobnun001f3b833ljtn8cf@published" data-word-count="108">Maus is short and has an eager smile and dark, expressive eyebrows. When I met her at her lab at Mass General in a building one block from Boston Harbor, I got a sense of how she might have stuck it out despite the warnings from her colleagues. She was friendly but didn’t let me get away with being wrong, a practice seemingly honed from years of supervising Ph.D. students and postdocs. “Let me tweak that,” she would say back to me when I fumbled through a question about cellular biology. Her attraction to immunotherapy was simple: Because it <em>should</em> work, she was determined to make it work.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobo08001g3b83h06hbpos@published" data-word-count="76">Maus knew that though cancer has long confounded efforts to kill it, it has a vulnerability. Cancerous tissue can be a pinpoint or a swarm, but it is always made up of cells. And those cells have to be at least somewhat different from the other cells in the body, or they wouldn’t be cancer. If you could train the immune system’s T cells to recognize that difference, that would be the end of the disease.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobo63001h3b83tnb21537@published" data-word-count="59">Efforts to attain that goal have already reshaped oncology. Researchers have developed drugs that selectively bind to proteins in cancer cells, inactivating them (targeted therapies); they’ve discovered ways to attack tumors by modulating the body’s immune response (immune checkpoint inhibitors); and they’ve gotten good at growing white blood cells outside the body and reinfusing them to overwhelm a tumor.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobob7001i3b83o1je1qxz@published" data-word-count="120">Some of these approaches, while powerful, were a bit like flooding your house to get rid of the rats. What if we could hire an exterminator instead? Immunologists zeroed in on the T cell, learning how to manipulate its genetic code to prompt it to hunt for specific proteins on the surface of cancer cells; other changes made the T cells more active. This engineered T cell has a special name: a CAR-T cell. (car stands for “chimeric antigen receptor.” The receptor is what binds a T cell to a protein on a cell’s surface. Antigen is another name for that protein. And the chimera, in this case, is the hybrid between the T cell’s normal receptor and its genetically modified components.)</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobocy001j3b834o6bsb5g@published" data-word-count="62">A decade ago, when Maus was at the University of Pennsylvania, her mentor, the immunologist Carl June, developed an astonishingly effective CAR-T therapy for leukemia. In some forms of the disease, a class of white blood cells called B cells begins to divide rapidly. June and his team programmed their CAR-T cells to target a protein on the B cells’ surface called CD19.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjoboes001k3b83785rp1yn@published" data-word-count="95">The CAR-T cells did their job quickly and thoroughly, binding to CD19, eliminating the B cells, and curing the leukemia. Almost overnight, CAR-T cells became the most exciting technology in cancer. Today, more than 34,000 leukemia patients have received some form of CAR-T therapy, and there are some 1,100 different CAR-T trials underway around the world. Everyone working in June’s lab became cancer-world famous. (At a recent conference, a scientist who got up to speak after June told the audience he felt like he was “standing up to play the ukulele after the Rolling Stones.”)</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobon3001l3b8337l1tp4r@published" data-word-count="82">The biggest question in oncology today is whether this approach could also be used for solid tumors. Maus was one of dozens of specialists in immunotherapy who began looking for a suitable cancer for a new CAR-T trial. “I’m not an expert in any disease right now,” she told me, “but I think a lot about how to get T cells to do what we want them to do. The T cell is my hammer, and I’m on the lookout for nails.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobotp001m3b83s3saubtm@published" data-word-count="56">Glioblastoma, she knew, had a promising nail for the T-cell hammer: an antigen called epidermal-growth-factor-receptor variant III (EGFRvIII), which isn’t found in healthy brain tissue. In a clinical trial she began before moving to Mass General, she and a neurosurgeon at Penn named Donald O’Rourke gave patients intravenous injections of T cells engineered to target EGFRvIII.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobov5001n3b83gke5o4gd@published" data-word-count="85">The experiment was a failure. Some of the CAR-T cells made it to the patients’ brains, but they didn’t seem to have any effect on the tumor. By the time Maus set up her lab at Mass General in 2015, she had two ideas for how to improve the treatment, “one big one and one medium one.” The medium one was to infuse the T cells directly into the fluid surrounding the brain, which would, she hoped, allow more of them to reach the tumor.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjoboxu001o3b83lim1nfbm@published" data-word-count="91">The big idea was meant to address a separate problem. Glioblastoma, like most solid tumors, is heterogeneous. Different parts of the tumor have different proteins on the surface of their cells, which makes eliminating them by going after EGFRvIII alone impossible. Maus’s new CAR-T cell was engineered to secrete a molecule called a bispecific T-cell engager, which acted like a bit of double-sided tape, making it easier for T cells to bind to a second protein called wild-type EGFR. The approach, Maus said, was “as fine-tuned as I can possibly imagine.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjoboze001p3b83ouwnrpxp@published" data-word-count="43">Maus and Haber were at dinner when she showed him scans from the first patient. “The world stopped,” he said. The possibilities were immediately clear. “If it’s really working in glioblastoma,” he said, “does that open up the whole bandwidth of solid tumors?”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobp1c001q3b83yoge5c9r@published" data-word-count="106">Maus was quick to point out the limits of what this first phase of the trial has proved. The modified T cells were remarkably effective, but they also eventually disappeared, probably killed by the body’s own immune system. Of the three patients, one died from a perforated bowel, an adverse reaction to a medication he was taking. The second had a recurrence within months of the tumor vanishing. And even Fraser, who had the longest-lasting response, has recently seen signs that his cancer is starting to grow again. “I feel like this was a double or a triple,” Maus told me. “It’s not a home run.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobp33001r3b83ngn8nlyh@published" data-word-count="74">June’s assessment was more sanguine. He compared Maus’s experiment to his celebrated work with leukemia. It took just five years to get from their first promising results to FDA approval; today, thousands of patients have been effectively cured. “I think by 2029, we’re going to have FDA approval of CAR-T cells for glioblastoma,” he said. “It’s going to be a huge thing, and 2024 is going to be looked at as the breakthrough year.”</p>

  

  

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobp6e001t3b830mp146pj@published" data-word-count="80">Cancer researchers are fluent in the language of failure. The past century, divided in half by Richard Nixon’s declaration of a war on cancer in 1971, has been marked by frustrations and setbacks, approaches that should have worked but didn’t. Oncologists once thought they were treating a single disease. Now they know that no two types of cancer are alike. Indeed, the same cancer in two individuals can be wildly different. “Cancer,” Haber told me, “is as complicated as medicine.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobp7t001u3b83bjpty7ss@published" data-word-count="68">For all the promise of immunotherapy, there are formidable obstacles. The first of these is cost. At Maus’s lab, every device and every person represents tightly coiled helixes of time and money. There are PCR machines, biosafety cabinets, ELISA readers, autoclaves, freezers, cell counters, incubators, and centrifuges. The proliferation of white, boxy machines makes the space look like an open-floor-plan office with an unusual number of personal mini-fridges.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobp9b001v3b83myzw5e98@published" data-word-count="85">When I visited, many of the researchers on the floor (there are dozens of them — young, a mix of genders and races) were staring at computers. Others were busy at what we’d recognizably call lab work, transferring liquids from one container to another, moving things in and out of freezers, placing things under a microscope or removing them. The lab itself carries Maus’s affect: friendly but solemn, collegial but not disposed to gossip or chitchat. Nearly everyone has an M.D., a Ph.D., or both.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobpat001w3b836u5vahmt@published" data-word-count="133">Maus walked me through some of the steps needed to create CAR-T cells for the trial. We started with the room where the DNA instructions that are added to the T cell’s genome are written. (“I ran my first restriction digest on a DNA plasmid the summer after eighth grade,” Maus told me. “I was so excited. I didn’t sleep for two days afterward.”) We went on to the lentiviral-production room, where technicians create viral vectors carrying this DNA. From there, we moved to the tissue-culture room, where the vector is mixed with normal T cells to create the CAR-T. Finally, we visited the immune-monitoring part of the lab, where lab techs assay blood draws and other samples from patients, looking for proof that the CAR-T cells have made it to their targets.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobpc8001x3b83u4wtlozk@published" data-word-count="51">Maus calls the lab “as whole shebang as you can get.” The only part missing are the mice they use for testing; those are upstairs. Maus says she’s glad of that — she’s allergic to mice. It takes this whole apparatus, working together, weeks to create enough T cells for one infusion.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobpe5001y3b834vrzc76z@published" data-word-count="82">Jennifer Wargo, a professor of genomic medicine at MD Anderson, referred to the cost of immunotherapy treatments as “financial toxicity.” The patent for June’s CAR-T therapy for leukemia is owned by Novartis, and the median cost for the treatment is $620,000. Even if drug companies don’t try to profit from these therapies, the process is inherently labor-intensive: T cells have to be removed from the patient’s own blood, genetically altered, then reinfused. It’s difficult to determine where economies of scale might kick in.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobpft001z3b83vdg1yq2p@published" data-word-count="129">The complicated process of producing CAR-T cells also limits the number of people who can be treated. For an emerging therapy like CAR-T for glioblastoma, the restrictions are even greater. Over the past few months, I spoke with several patients searching for a trial that would take them on. ​​Michael McNally was diagnosed last summer, after he noticed a slight droop on the left side of his face. He went to Mass General, suspecting a mild stroke. After an MRI, the doctor told him he had a tumor in his right frontal lobe. “I said, ‘Look, we’re changing the rules here at Mass General,’” McNally said. If a doctor delivered news like that, “you better have a Redbreast whiskey in your right hand.” He had surgery two days later.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobphm00203b83z65ziair@published" data-word-count="91">McNally has gone through an exhaustive list of treatments trying to improve on the standard of care, including a personalized cancer vaccine. “If someone told me scorpion poison would kill it, I’d probably take it,” he said. “I’m a giant mouse; let’s go. Let’s do it.” He won’t be able, however, to enroll in Maus’s trial. Because they want to ensure that any positive outcome can be attributed to the CAR-T regime alone, the exclusion criteria rule out anyone who has been treated with “any prior gene-therapy or gene-modified cellular therapy.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobpz000213b839yxrxnov@published" data-word-count="121">Timing can be difficult for patients and their families to manage. After her father, Yuriy, was diagnosed with glioblastoma, Yelena Tsyrlin tried to enroll him in an immunotherapy trial right away, but she still missed the eligibility window. (She has since started the process to secure a spot in O’Rourke’s follow-up study to the one he conducted with Maus, which has also shown promising results.) Another caregiver wrote that her mother kept getting rejected from trials because she was still on hormone therapy for breast cancer, which she’d had more than five years earlier. “I understand the reasoning and the science behind these decisions,” she wrote, “but when you’re facing this as a patient or a family member, it feels cruel.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobq0n00223b83cplwnqoe@published" data-word-count="39">None of the oncologists I spoke with thought that immunotherapy would completely supplant proven approaches. Some cancers will still be best treated by surgery, others by radiation or chemotherapy. CAR-T therapy may be reserved for the most stubborn cancers.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobq2f00233b83k28pty5b@published" data-word-count="105">As more CAR-T treatments get FDA approval, however, cost and efficiency may improve. “You’re on the incipient curve of discovery,” Haber said, “but science builds on itself, and sometimes things that are incredibly complicated, expensive, and dangerous open the door to things that become much more democratic, affordable, and standard.” Researchers are looking at ways to use a virus to genetically modify T cells inside a patient’s body, effectively eliminating half of the steps Maus walked me through in her lab. Others are experimenting with vaccines that can teach the immune system to target the same kind of antigens that the CAR-T cells bind to.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobq4600243b83azrc2fha@published" data-word-count="52">Maus and Choi have already refined the protocol for their glioblastoma trial. Patients will now have a short run of chemotherapy before the infusion to limit the number of CAR-T cells killed or inactivated by the innate immune system, allowing more of them to remain active at the tumor site for longer.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobq6d00253b83xjwi42th@published" data-word-count="88">In our first conversation, I asked Maus if Mass General hired her because of the incredible results from the CAR-T therapies developed at Penn. She said they weren’t hiring a CAR-T specialist; they were hiring a T-cell specialist. The difference was meaningful. The CAR-T cell, as complicated as it is, is one expression of a much deeper knowledge. That may be how we ultimately reduce costs: The better we understand the immune system, the easier it will be to find ways to make it do what we want.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobq9l00273b83rer56qh1@published" data-word-count="119">On the first day of summer, I went to visit Tom Fraser, participant No. 2 in the trial, at his home outside Rochester. I had been warned that the cancer had made speaking difficult for him, and all my phone communications to that point had been with his wife, Debbie. After spending months talking to patients with glioblastoma and their families, I feared the worst. So it was a pleasant surprise to be greeted at the door by a tall, sturdy man with a shock of salt-and-pepper hair. “Welcome,” he said, shaking my hand. “I’m Tom Fraser.” He led me to his tidy kitchen, where we sat and talked for nearly two hours. The sun outside was almost unbearably bright.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqbe00283b83lzbls9cz@published" data-word-count="69">Before he retired, Tom led a forensic engineering firm. After some catastrophe, he’d be called in to determine its causes. When a Bethlehem Steel warehouse near Buffalo caught fire a few years ago, sending up a plume of smoke so large 300 households and several schools had to be evacuated, Tom determined that the culprit was an improperly installed lighting system that had thrown sparks onto flammable materials below.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqm800293b83x390t02f@published" data-word-count="62">He takes the same methodical approach to discussing the course of his disease, consulting a timeline he’s marked out on a legal pad. “I put some dates down here just so I can remember,” he told me. Sometimes Debbie, voluble where Tom was laconic, with a neatly trimmed gray bob, would interject. Tom would pause to listen, then return to his outline.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqnt002a3b836lzl5b0c@published" data-word-count="101">In August 2021, they were staying at their cottage in the Thousand Islands — a little white house perched on a rock in the Saint Lawrence River — when Tom first knew something was wrong. “I got up in the morning,” he said, “and I couldn’t read.” It took him a month to schedule an MRI, but once he did, the diagnosis arrived quickly. He’d never heard of glioblastoma, but his doctor was direct with him: Without treatment, he could die within six months. He and Debbie told their family — four daughters and eight grandchildren — the news over Zoom.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqpi002b3b837cn3ou51@published" data-word-count="63">One of Tom’s daughters works as a physician’s assistant at Mass General, and she encouraged him to travel there to get his tumor resected. His surgeon, Brian Nahed, needed nearly five hours to complete the operation. Tom showed me the scar, a horseshoe on the left side of his head. “It’s okay as long as I can comb my hair over it,” he said.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqr9002c3b83h3uganvx@published" data-word-count="88">After the surgery, he started radiation and chemotherapy, then underwent treatment by Optune, a device that uses electric fields to try to disrupt cell division. Nahed was frank about the likelihood of any of these approaches keeping the cancer in remission for long. “He said, ‘That’ll work until it doesn’t work,’” Debbie told me. “‘This is what happens. This heterogeneous cancer figures out ways. That’s what makes it so aggressive and so difficult to treat.’” Even so, when the cancer recurred after 20 months, the Frasers felt blindsided.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqsq002d3b83f4fxxhys@published" data-word-count="61">It was Nahed who suggested Tom enroll in the trial being run by his colleagues at Mass General, calling the Frasers at dinner on a Sunday night in the spring of 2023. His message was one of both caution and hope: There was no guarantee this treatment would work, but there was also no more promising trial anywhere in the world.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqui002e3b83tmkjgajw@published" data-word-count="61">On the day of the infusion in July 2023, 30 people crowded into the room with Tom and Debbie to watch. For all the time and money and innovation that went into producing that moment, the scene was oddly humble: a normal hospital room, Tom sitting up in his bed as a doctor wearing gloves pushed the plunger on a syringe.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqwz002f3b83uvvnjqt5@published" data-word-count="105">The next month was difficult. Even though the scans showed the tumor shrinking, matching the dramatic results from the first patient, the doctors were reluctant to read too much into them. “They really were very careful not to give us information, even though we were asking all the time,” Debbie said. In the weeks that followed, Tom suffered a cascade of complications: atrial fibrillation, mysterious infections, a punishing fever. The nurses swaddled him in blanket after blanket, but still he shook uncontrollably. Debbie kept watch 12 hours a day. Choi tried to reassure them that the effects were a sign that the treatment was working.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqyp002g3b83xmz7cjhh@published" data-word-count="72">“By the time I left,” Tom said, “I could hardly walk.” Debbie showed me a picture from that day. Tom looked feeble and miserable, “not himself,” in her words. “Let me see that,” Tom said, and Debbie turned the picture to him. “Oh,” he said. “That <em>is</em> not myself.” When they arrived back in New York, the grandchildren greeted them with a WELCOME HOME poster, a hand-drawn rainbow floating near the bottom.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobr0s002h3b83uwx7ojev@published" data-word-count="80">That fall, Tom felt strong enough to return to the family’s cottage in the Thousand Islands. He wanted to help power-wash the house, but Debbie overruled him. They knew nothing about participants Nos. 1 and 3 in the trial and precious little about Tom’s own prognosis. “We knew that things were stable, but we did not know the profound results,” Debbie said. That all changed when Maus and her team published the paper in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine.</em></p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobr2e002i3b83ft4kthnp@published" data-word-count="76">If CAR-T therapy for glioblastoma eventually becomes standard of care — if Maus and others can reproduce and improve on the results she got for Tom Fraser — his name will forever be tied with the birth of this treatment. “I shouldn’t say it, but I’m a little proud of myself,” Tom said. “There were three of us in the group, the first three to ever have it and try it. And I was the No. 2 guy.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobr9t002j3b8358gcqyz2@published" data-word-count="123">Hope can be a shot of adrenaline or the steady drip of an IV, but it’s always strong medicine. The intense days of those first incredible scans are long behind the Frasers; they have settled into a different rhythm recently, something approximating the way they were before the diagnosis. Tom has also shifted the way he talks about his disease. For years, he spoke about beating glioblastoma — finding a cure for himself. Now he’s more likely to refer to the patients who come after him, who will undoubtedly live longer because of what we’ve learned from his response to the CAR-T therapy. This spring, he packed up his library of engineering reference books and donated them to Clarkson College, his alma mater.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobrbf002k3b83pvufypo3@published" data-word-count="102">He might not be done with his fight yet, however. After a scan in February showed signs of recurrence, a new set of images taken in June showed just the opposite. The tumor had seemingly shrunk again. “I said, ‘Holy crap, I’m going to do a dance,’” Tom said. Now, according to Debbie, he’s in better shape than he’s been in months. Was it a temporary effect or a sign that the T cells were still active in his brain? We may only know years from now, and then only by implication, if a strong enough signal emerges from future CAR-T trials.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobrd1002l3b83q3tbxm5c@published" data-word-count="83">Tom’s next scan is not till August. In the meantime, he told me about a trip he and Debbie were planning: “I’ve never visited Chicago in my life. I said, ‘This is nuts. I want to see this place — so let’s go.’” That morning, they had been to their youngest grandson’s fifth-grade graduation. It was a hot day, and they sat sweating in the parking lot. It had been almost three years since he’d been told he might have six months to live.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cc-animate="">
      <p><span>Imagine a smart watch, but from 1984. That sounds like something straight out of a scifi film since the 80s is not exactly known for great advances in personal computing. Well, it’s real, and it is exactly what Seiko created back in the day and was known as the UC-2000 - a “personal information processor” that you can wear on your wrist. As you would expect, it was a novel device that was released for $300, or almost $700 adjusted for inflation.</span></p>

<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0139/0434/7193/files/c90c3ee99c6bbffb2ea919e8dbd57989_600x600.gif?v=1640843722" alt=""></span></p>

<p><span>It looks like a computer and almost worked like one too, although it can’t technically be called a computer until you dock it on an external keyboard that adds actual computer-like functionalities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the gamers reading, this watch is obviously incapable of running </span><i><span>Crysis. </span></i><span>But what can it do and how did it come to be? Read on to find out.</span></p>

<h2><span>Why Make a Wrist Computer</span></h2>
<p><span>During the dawn of the computing age, western companies focused on making their hardware more powerful and more complex. This is how you got massive computers - it didn’t matter how big a computer became as long as it was more powerful than the last.</span></p>

<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0139/0434/7193/files/29370-47319-000-3x2-Apple-History-Mac-launch-xl_600x600.jpg?v=1640843834" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>The Mac, before it was cool. Source: <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/01/24/apple-launched-macintosh-on-january-24-1984-and-changed-the-world----eventually" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Insider</a></span></p>

<p><span>On the other hand, Eastern companies, particularly Japanese ones, focused on making computers smaller and lighter while sacrificing functionality. This is how we got to the Seiko UC-2000: a watch with data entry, translation, and calculation functions that you can wear on your wrist.</span></p>
<p><span>The Seiko smart watch was undoubtedly state of the art technology when it was released, but was there even a demand for such a device?</span></p>

<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0139/0434/7193/files/seiko_detail_600x600.jpg?v=1640844013" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>Look at this marvel!&nbsp;</span><span>Source: <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/11/14/80s-smartwatch-finally-plays-tetris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hackaday</a></span></p>

<p><span>Seiko marketed it to people who already owned computers. Since you can’t bring your computer with you, this device can be your mini-computer for the day while you’re out and about, which can connect and transmit data to your home computer. It sold well for the first few months, but 2 years later and the UC-2000 was already in the bargain bin, with entire watch + dock bundles selling for 1/3rd of its original price.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span>The Retro Futuristic Look</span></h2>
<p><span>The product came in 2 parts: the watch and the keyboard dock. Let’s look at the watch first.</span></p>

<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0139/0434/7193/files/vintage-seiko-memo-diary-lcd-digital_360_42b63f829cb941a67be6d32e5d17355a_600x600.jpg?v=1640846722" alt=""></span></p>

<p><span>For the 80s, it looks quite futuristic. The Seiko UC-2000 face is an LCD dot matrix display with a black bezel while the body is a metallic grey, matching the stainless steel bracelet. There are four buttons in its lower area colored orange on the outer ends and grey in the middle, replacing the crown as the adjustment mechanism. It looks incredibly similar to the smartwatches of today.</span></p>

<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0139/0434/7193/files/bc2ddfec876d6ad2d6cf54656cac9770_600x600.jpg?v=1640846772" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>It almost looks like a toy. Source: Pinterest</span></p>

<p><span>Then there’s the UC-2100 keyboard which turned the watch into an actual computer. When the watch is mounted on the dock, it becomes this completely geeky looking machine which would have been the pièce de résistance</span> <span>in a tech collector’s display. It’s a QWERTY keyboard with extra buttons to change the language and access its different functions. On the left side is a square cutout where the watch sits and communicates with the keyboard through electromagnets. The on and off switch is also located at the front.</span></p>
<p><span>The keyboard is small enough to fit in the pocket, but not small enough that you can wear it on your wrist together with a watch. In fact it looks comically large if worn like this, but making the keyboard any smaller would have made it very hard to type on.</span></p>

<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0139/0434/7193/files/iAxehPR_600x600.jpg?v=1640846845" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>The watch serves as the monitor for this computer. Source: <a href="https://www.techeblog.com/before-smartwatches-there-was-the-seiko-uc-2000-wrist-computer-here-are-5-cool-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Techeblog</a></span></p>

<p><span>Need something with a little more power? There is also the UC-2200 dock which came with a </span><i><span>spool-fed printer, </span></i><span>just in case you needed something printed while on the go. How’s that for high-tech?</span></p>

<h2><span>What Can it Do?</span></h2>
<p><span>The watch tells the time and date, can function as a stopwatch, and also as an alarm clock like most other digital watches of its time. But when coupled with the UC-2100 keyboard, it becomes the “Wrist Information System” that can store memos, keep your appointments scheduled, and act like a calculator. You can save up to 2 memos of 1000 characters each, hence the UC-2000 model name.</span></p>

<p><span>How cool is a built-in printer? Source: Gtello</span></p>

<p><span>The UC-2200 keyboard has the same functionalities with a few extras. As mentioned before, it has a spool-fed printer for memo or data that you need on paper, literally. It also included removable ROM packs or cartridges that contained early PC programs. 1 ROM pack contained Microsoft BASIC which is the foundation software of the then fledgling Bill Gates company. Two other ROM packs came with games and an ENG-JAP translator.</span></p>

<h2><span>It’s Limitations</span></h2>
<p><span>For all the things it can do, this exciting piece of technology has a few setbacks that stopped it from being a must-have technology. The display is not particularly impressive, even though it was a relatively new LCD technology developed by Seiko subsidiary Epson. It can change the contrast brightness but it can still only display basic characters and not the more popular graphical interfaces at the time.</span></p>
<p><span>The screen is a 10x4 matrix display, and with such limited screen real estate, it was only usable for the watch functions but not so for the computer ones. While the UC-2000 apparently played video games, we can’t imagine how it would have looked like with such a tiny and colorless display.</span></p>

<p><span>You can play Tetris on it though.

<p><span>Limited storage was also a factor to its failure. It can store 2000 characters in total for its memo function, less than 4 tweets. It may be useful for a short grocery list but not quite enough for any business-related applications. You would have to be incredibly succinct with your memos.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But while it may seem unwieldy to us in the 21st century, it was the advanced technology of its time, born from Seiko’s need to be at the forefront of new innovations, and Japan’s love for miniaturising anything and everything.</span></p>

<h2><span>Fast Forward to Today</span></h2>
<p><span>The UC-2000 and its siblings (yup, it wasn’t the first or last Seiko smartwatch) exists today as a vintage collector’s item for two niches: the Seiko collectors and the vintage tech enthusiasts. It seems that Seiko produced a good enough surplus that some shops still carry a small quantity of this smartwatch in mint and working condition today.</span></p>
<p><span>As for Seiko smartwatches that are actually useful in today’s day and age, there are not any made in the same form factor as the 1984 Wrist Information System. I guess they left that niche to Apple and Samsung while they focus on honing and improving their mechanical watches.</span></p>

<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0139/0434/7193/files/wena_01_600x600.jpg?v=1640848495" alt=""></span></p>

<p><span>That said, they did have a collaboration with Sony to create the Seiko x Sony Wena Wrist which is a Seiko mechanical watch with Sony smartwatch functions built-in on the bracelet’s clip. It allowed for digital payments and notifications but not really much else. Better to stick to the Apple watch if you want more than just novelty.</span></p>

<h2>
<span>Do you Love Vin</span><span>tage?</span>
</h2>
<p><span>If you’re fascinated with anything vintage, you might be interested in a watch that is brand new but looks like it came from the last century.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We’ve released 3 watch cases that look like they already stood the test of time and already patinated for your next vintage build. The first one is our </span><a href="https://www.namokimods.com/products/nmk901-skx-watch-case-aged-steel-finish?_pos=1&amp;_sid=21009c5a1&amp;_ss=r"><span>SKX007 case with aged steel finish</span></a><span> measuring 42mm, and comes with a matching bezel and crown. Pair this with an insert and dial with patina lume and you get a nice antique-looking build.</span></p>

<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0139/0434/7193/files/NMK901-AG_NMK901SKXWatchCaseBundleAgedSteelFinish00045_v3_600x600.png?v=1640851970" alt=""></span></p>

<p><span>We also have 2 </span><a href="https://www.namokimods.com/collections/srpe-cases"><span>SRPE pilot cases</span></a><span> with the same aged steel finish, one with a regular pilot bezel and the other with a coiled bezel and crown, also known as an onion case. This is another easy-to-build-with case that will help you create the old-timey watch for your patina collection.</span></p>

<h2><span>Wrap Up</span></h2>
<p><span>While it can be argued that the UC-2000 was an unnecessary watch, you can’t really fault Seiko for wanting to do the not-yet-done-before watches. This same innovative spirit gave us the </span><a href="https://www.namokimods.com/blogs/namokitimes/deep-dive-a-look-at-the-seiko-tuna-6159-and-its-variants?_pos=1&amp;_sid=b10889b59&amp;_ss=r"><span>Seiko Tuna</span></a><span> which is an amazing diver that solved many of the issues with the divers watches of its time, or the </span><a href="https://www.namokimods.com/blogs/namokitimes/seiko-watch-movements-7s26-6r15-nh36?_pos=1&amp;_sid=b8181c7b7&amp;_ss=r"><span>Seiko Quartz Astron</span></a><span> which led to the quartz watch revolution that almost put the Swiss watch niche out of business. These sometimes genius and sometimes wacky watch designs all contribute to move horology forward.</span></p>
<p><span>In a similar vein, we at namokiMODS are always thinking of new parts to make available for the Seiko modding community to give our professional and hobbyist modders more choices to build their vision with. So if you haven’t already, join our newsletter, check out our socials, and stay tuned for our future watch part releases!</span></p>

Their idea at the time was to invest in Web 2.0, meaning the nascent world of web apps. They built a few products at the time. One was an online classified ad service called Edge.io that was supposed to mimic Craigslist on every site on the web. The other was a startup tracking service called TechCrunch that aimed to review every Web 2.0 site popping up on the nascent Internet. Teare, for his part, focused on the startup while Arrington focused on the blog.</span></p><p><span>At the time, the media industry was being upended by bloggers who moved faster and wrote off-the-cuff stories about nearly everything, essentially beating print magazines to every punch. Along the way, they destroyed the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/12/17/death-to-the-embargo/" rel="">embargo system</a><span>, built the first influencers, gave rise to </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Swisher" rel="">hagiographic access journalism</a><span>, turned true reviews into affiliate marketing plays, savaged advertising revenue, and threw traditional journalism into a death spiral whose crash is currently finalizing itself around the world. But, at the time, they were pretty cool.</span></p><p>Arrington spent most of his waking hours publishing Web 2.0 stories and asking his VC buddies for scoops. He monetized the site by selling square ads on the side of the page for a few thousand dollars a month, and emblazoned there were early come-ons for the same sites Arrington was reviewing. Eventually, those sponsors paid enough money to expand the site into multiple topics, including MobileCrunch and my site, CrunchGear.</p><p>I started CrunchGear for Mike in 2006. At this point, TechCrunch had eclipsed most of the rest of Archimedes Ventures, leaving Arrington to spend nearly every waking hour on TC. To cater to a global audience, he would stay up until three or four writing scoops about exciting new services like TWTR and Spotify and yelling loudly at Mark Hendrickson, a recent college grad who was imprisoned in Mike’s Palo Alto home. When I came by for my initial interview, I had to wake Mike up and he took me to CostCo to buy stuff for a party he was holding that night.</p><p>If you want to understand what life was like back then, blogger Om Malik suffered a heart attack from overwork (and too many cigars) while Arrington himself told the NYT that his lifestyle was awful:</p><p><em><span>“I haven’t died yet,” said Michael Arrington, the founder and co-editor of </span><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/" rel="">TechCrunch</a><span>, a popular technology blog. The site has brought in millions in advertising revenue, but there has been a hefty cost. Mr. Arrington says he has gained 30 pounds in the last three years, developed a severe sleeping disorder and turned his home into an office for him and four employees. “At some point, I’ll have a nervous breakdown and be admitted to the hospital, or something else will happen.”</span></em></p><p><em>“This is not sustainable,” he said.</em></p><p>TechCrunch was the definitive startup news site. To get on the front page - however briefly - meant 10,000 new signups to your service and countless calls from Valley VCs. That was TC’s power: it could make or break a site. This gave us silly kids an inordinate amount of power (and eventually led me to suffer a fairly debilitating depression) because startup founders needed us to close out their rounds. “Get a TC story,” the VCs would say, and founders would listen. One pair of Dutch entrepreneurs walked into Mike’s house with coffee, entering his bedroom in hopes of convincing him to write about whatever they were flogging. Legend has it that at one point an irate German entrepreneur spit on Mike at an event, leading us all to have a profound distrust of humanity.</p><p>The site flourished during the Web 3.0 and Mobile Web days and settled into a routine of startup news speckled with more hard-hitting investigations on privacy and hardware. It spawned the best startup event on the planet, Disrupt, and essentially defined how to pitch for tens of thousands of entrepreneurs. I personally ran pitch-offs around the world in bars and concert halls as a sort of scouting mechanism for TC. When I was doing this, during the early 2010s, TC was already becoming insular and SF-focused.</p><p>After the Great Recession, however, global startups and local U.S. startup hubs began producing some interesting things. The San Francisco-focused writers often ignored these startups simply because they didn’t get that innovation could happen anywhere outside of the Mission. I called myself the East Coast Editor and said that my beat was everything outside San Francisco.</p><p>This was TC’s first mistake.</p><p>To populate Disrupt with startups, it needed to bring in hopefuls from outside the Valley. Sure, you could bring Zuckerberg up from Palo Alto to speak, but smaller companies from places like Paris, Chicago, and Tel Aviv were the real customers. These folks, ignored by nearly everyone, felt they could get a fair hearing at Disrupt and on the pages of TechCrunch. Little did they know that the SF crew mostly cared about Uber’s next round of investment, while folks like myself and Mike Butcher brought the TC gospel to people who yearned to be noticed.</p><p>This effort turned into a grind. I’d fly into a city, get to the hotel, eat and drink too much, and then get cornered for five hours at an event where I drank even more. We’d hold a pitch-off with a few local startups and VCs and then run around Yount or Dizengoff Street until the wee hours, drunk on gin and tonics and power. We were kingmakers, after all.</p><p>This was TC’s second mistake.</p><p>TC squandered this power. The SF crew, now run by AOL and Yahoo overlords, were focused on everything except startups. Traffic was paramount and ad sales were vital, so niche startup posts, posts that everyone once read but were now read by the company, lost their value. Over time, the value of a traditional TC story waned. Sites liked ProductHunt - which the bosses at TC were thinking of buying - eclipsed the power of a TC post. PR got expensive, so companies used guerrilla tactics to raise their user counts and more cash. VCs grew more savvy and created their own pitch-offs and accelerators to build bigger portfolios. The kingmakers were no longer in charge. Further, mainstream news was covering startups, too, focusing on cool new sites and gadgets.</p><p>As an aside, have you ever wondered why gadget sites suck now? You can thank the guy who replaced me at Gizmodo before I started CrunchGear, Brian Lam. Lam hit on the exciting concept that he should be paid for every widget one of his reviews sold, which led to affiliate marketing and, in turn, turned gadget review sites into churnalistic slop. In fact, his concept, one that ravaged sites like Engadget and CrunchGear, is directly responsible for the fact that outlets like New York Magazine were writing SEO-larded reviews of audio soundbars and TVs so they could get a 2% cut on every sale. Afflicting the comfortable, indeed.</p><p><span>But one thing TC always had was an edge. Arrington was often gleefully mean to startups that didn't live up to their promises. He called out Twitter for being down and essentially invented the “</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/04/06/comcast-twitter-and-the-chicken-trust-me-i-have-a-point/" rel="">complain on social media</a><span>” method of getting better customer service. At CrunchGear, we skewered things we thought were bad, called out bad actors, and did awful stuff like having Hitler complain about a new, overhyped tablet being late to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/24/hitler-discusses-the-notion-ink-adam-delays/#!" rel="">market</a><span>:</span></p><div id="youtube2-js7awHyFwKI" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;js7awHyFwKI&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/js7awHyFwKI?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>All that went away as bosses from Yahoo tried to understand how to milk even more cash out of TC’s events division while shutting down its multimedia efforts. Editor Matthew Panzarino did an admirable job of negotiating those shoals by keeping the suits out of the organization, but after he left they rushed in to fill Panzer’s glad-handing void. The result is TC’s third and final mistake.</p><p>After years of corporate ownership, culminating in Yahoo’s sale to private equity firm Apollo, TC has become a milquetoast site focused on big raises specially placed by expensive PR people and random tech news that has been neutered into pablum. The current editorial structure, controlled by one or two old-guard TCers and a lot of older editors hired by editor Connie Loizos. The once-freewheeling editorial strategy - writers wrote what they wanted at any time and nobody really edited anything - is being replaced by a more formalized system familiar to those who are one job away from become PR people themselves, while any hint of anger against the current crop of boy-kings in SF is dealt with harshly.</p><p><span>This all leads to what happened recently at TC. </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hjkamps/overlay/about-this-profile/" rel="">Haje Kamps</a><span> (who was, incidentally, running a side business advising startups, something that would have gotten him canned in previous incarnations of TC but was ignored because the wall between VC and editorial has been worn down to a nub) wrote about the lie of Alexandr Wang’s take on DEI vs. meritocracy. In a post that has since been toned down, Haje argued that Wang was a wang.</span></p><p><em><span>I just came off recording an </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/podcast/ai-powered-drug-development-vw-teams-up-with-rivian-and-dei-is-bad/" rel="">episode of Equity</a><span>, where I learned about the newest wave of stupidity. The tech industry’s DEI allergy has hit a new low, as Silicon Valley leaders are once again waving their “meritocracy” banners high and wide. Scale AI’s Alexandr Wang has decided that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are passé — and replaced them with his shiny new acronym MEI: merit, excellence, and intelligence. I cringed so hard I’m going to need a chiropractor.</span></em></p><p>DEI has long been a dangerous thing in the valley, primarily because the Valley is primarily run by white dudes. These white dudes, who got lucky once or twice and are worth billions, think everyone could be like them with just a little elbow grease and grit. After all, little Mark Zuckerberg pulled himself up by his bootstraps while hanging out in the dorms at Harvard and poor Travis Kalanick invented Uber when he was having a hard time finding a cab to go to a party in Paris. Meanwhile, the only notable entrepreneur to do jail time for defrauding investors was Elizabeth Holmes and the African-American founders of MoviePass were pushed out of the company by a lucky white dude.</p><p><span>White dude CEOs like </span><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company" rel="">Brian Armstrong</a><span> and Jesse Powell came out hard against DEI efforts and even </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kraken-crypto-ceo-jesse-powell-does-not-regret-offending-anyone-2022-7" rel="">paid employees to leave,</a><span> which led, incidentally, to morale at their companies so low it could be measured in millisieverts. But they were making money, baby, so it was all good.</span></p><p>So, by all measures, Alexandr Wang’s MEI bullshit was just that, bullshit. And Haje, speaking in a voice that once rang out of the old TechCrunch like a clarion, called him out. The resulting Twitter backlash spooked Loizos and Haje was dumped from the roster a few months after another group of OG TCers, including Catherine Shu, Matt Burns, and Darrell Etherington - were laid off. This trio alone were responsible for a good percentage of TC’s global traffic because they were still writing interesting things and had been for nearly two decades. Also laid off was a large number of the marketing team. In short, TC is contracting and getting scared.</p><p>Loizos has to earn out her buy-out, and her new editors, refugees from the great business news layoffs of the 2020s, are hungry to stay relevant. The site itself is global, but news sits on the page for hours instead of minutes, and the value of the site is in the toilet.</p><p><span>I talk to VCs and startup founders all the time on </span><a href="https://keepgoingpod.com/" rel="">Keep Going</a><span> and all of them say the same thing: they don’t read TC. The value to their businesses is simply gone, and the current story roster - from press releases like </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/capcut-will-stop-offering-free-cloud-storage-from-august-5/" rel="">CapCut</a><span> making a policy change to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/10/facebook-to-face-of-crypto-anthony-pompliano-wild-career/" rel="">glowing VC interviews</a><span> with some of the same odious men who believe in MEI - is junk. There are still plenty of people I consider friends and confidants on staff, and I know not every story is garbage. Sometimes </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/a-vc-told-keely-cat-wells-to-get-a-male-able-bodied-co-founder-she-balked-nabbed-a-2m-seed-round/" rel="">gold still shines through</a><span> (but even in this case the article is too long by half, something one of those vaunted editors should have caught). But in the end, TC is no longer relevant.</span></p><p>Here’s the saddest thing: it should be. Startups haven’t gone away. Any media startup could essentially recreate Arrington’s model and start selling little ads while profiling startups. Fun can be had poking holes in Valley blowhards, and there could be reams of content to be had by telling people how to be successful in startup land. But TC won’t do that anymore. It is stuck, churning through releases from the same pushy Valley PR people and thinking they’re doing good work when they simply aren’t.</p><p>What would I do? Bring back a global focus to startup coverage, ignore the PR people flogging minor updates to already popular services, and become the place where VCs go to figure out where to invest. This was TC’s original magic. By reducing the editors, who are currently awash in posts and unable to keep up, to give TC back some of its vitality. And they’d get bonus points for making money from events again and pulling themselves out from under the boulder of private equity.</p><p>I don’t write those words without sadness. Knowing what could have been had TC not climbed up its own backside makes me mad. An industry that once grew and changed and embraced nearly everyone before contracting into a black hole of Valley douchery is now holding the reins to its only source of criticism and celebration. TC isn’t a news site. It’s a corpse.</p><p>That’s its final failure.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            </div>
          <p>On Saturday, six days into the general strike by the National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU), someone in the KakaoTalk group chat operated by striking union members who work on the 8-inch semiconductor production line at Samsung’s Giheung plant posted a photo of their thumb, which has become deformed from their work. &nbsp;</p><p>“My thumb is becoming deformed,” the worker wrote. “My thumb is a badge of honor from the 8-inch production line.”</p><p>Workers on this production line are known not only for their deformed fingers but for a laundry list of physical ailments such as varicose veins, plantar fasciitis, and slipped discs. Employees posted numerous messages and photos about their conditions in the group chat.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the NSEU, the 8-inch semiconductor production line was operating at a mere 18% capacity on July 8, the first day of the strike. Normally, the line operates at 80% capacity. Women in their 20s, 30s and 40s who make up the lion’s share of the workers on the line are actively involved in the strike. All too acquainted with on-the-job injuries, these women told the Hankyoreh that pay raises and more days off aren’t their top concern.</p><p>“We just don’t want to be treated as disposable parts.”&nbsp;</p><p>In response to our inquiries about worker safety, a Samsung Electronics spokesperson replied, “We obey all work site safety standards dictated by the Occupational Safety and Health Act.”</p><p>“In spite of the strike, we are still meeting our production quotas, and are drafting countermeasures to ensure that there are no problems going forward,” the spokesperson added.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“We are machines”</strong></p><p>The 8-inch production line at Samsung’s Giheung plant is a foundry that produces 8-inch silicon wafers. A wafer is a thin slice of semiconductor, such as crystalline silicon, used for the fabrication of integrated circuits. These wafers are used in the manufacturing of automobiles and various home appliances.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung’s 12-inch line utilizes an overhead hoist transport (OHT) system, an automated transport network that operates along tracks installed on the ceiling, to move bundles of 25 wafers called “lots.” On the 8-inch line, however, this transportation is done manually. There is much more market demand for 12-inch wafers, so Samsung has modernized and automated many processes. The 8-inch line, however, is outdated. This is the same production line where two employees were exposed to X-ray radiation this past May.&nbsp;</p><p>Workers on this line manually transport the lots, which weigh between 3 and 5 kilograms, and feed them into machinery that completes the manufacturing process and spits them back out. That’s what these workers do, over and over for eight hours a day, on their feet the whole time. The work deforms their fingers and wrecks their legs with varicose veins. A worker identified as “A” is in her 15th year of employment on this production line. She rotates between three shifts: 6 am, 2 pm, and 10 pm.&nbsp;</p><p>“Technically, we get an hour for lunch, but the machinery never stops operating, so someone has to fill that spot at all times,” Worker A added.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re so busy we can’t even eat or go to the bathroom without stressing out.”</p><p>Worker B is in her 25th year on the line.&nbsp;</p><p>“After suffering from a severe bladder infection, I no longer drink water before work, and I don’t even look at coffee,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The company sets production quotas, and every group is evaluated based on performance, adding psychological pressure to the grueling physical labor.&nbsp;</p><p>“When someone is exempt from overtime due to a pregnancy, they don’t send anyone in their place, which means those of us left on the line just have to do more work,” said Worker A. &nbsp;</p><p>“I was diagnosed with depression and even admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. Many of my colleagues also suffer from depression.”&nbsp;</p><p>In response to such testimonies, the Samsung spokesperson replied, “We operate a preventative musculoskeletal exercise center and a health enhancement room to promote the health of our line workers.”</p><p>“We strictly adhere to the standards outlined in the Occupational Safety and Health Act regarding the musculoskeletal health of our workers,” the spokesperson added.</p><p>“There is no evidence to suggest that sickness or injury rates on the 8-inch are higher than other production lines, and there have been no applications for workers’ compensation for industrial accidents from that line.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“Can’t take a break even if we want to”</strong></p><p>For night shift workers, who deal with disrupted circadian rhythms, days off are essential. Yet a shortage of workers makes vacation days just numbers on paper. Workers don’t dare to actually take a day off.&nbsp;</p><p>Worker C, who started working for Samsung in 2010 and has spent most of her time on the 8-inch line, said, “Other departments apparently have to use their mandatory PTO, but when we schedule days off, we have to do a lottery.”</p><p>Worker D, who is in her 15th year at the company, said, “Even if we get new employees, many of them can’t handle the night shifts and quit, so we’re always shorthanded.”</p><p>“If too many people want to use their vacation days, we have to play rock, paper, scissors to decide who gets to,” Worker D said.</p><p>When questioned about this issue, the Samsung spokesperson said, “The claim that employees are restricted from using their vacation days is a one-sided one made by only a handful of employees.”&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the workers on the 8-inch line graduated from specialized vocational and trade high schools. They have endured their working conditions by telling themselves they work for a “top global corporation.” Now, they are joining the NSEU strike to make a statement: Don’t treat us like machine components.</p><p>Worker E, who is in her 15th year at the company, said the strike is “a part of the process of finding a way to prevent the harmful practices of the 8-inch line from being passed on, a way to change them.”&nbsp;</p><p>“The reality is that the company is ignoring the words of the union, so I decided I couldn’t just stand by and watch,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the first general strike in Samsung Electronics’ 55-year history, and it appears likely that the forewarned setbacks to production quotas may become a reality. Although Samsung is denying it, numerous workers on the 8-inch line told the Hankyoreh that over half of the line’s workers have joined the strike.&nbsp;</p><p>“The company needs to acknowledge that the accumulated disappointment and anger of the workers is what’s fueling the strike,” an NSEU insider said.&nbsp;</p><p>The NSEU held a rally in front of Samsung’s Giheung plant on Monday.&nbsp;</p><p>By Park Tae-woo, staff reporter</p><p>Please direct questions or comments to [<a href="mailto:english@hani.co.kr">english@hani.co.kr</a>]</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The enduring legacy of Euclidean geometry underpins classical machine learning, which, for decades, has been primarily developed for data lying in Euclidean space. Yet, modern machine learning increasingly encounters richly structured data that is inherently nonEuclidean. This data can exhibit intricate geometric, topological and algebraic structure: from the geometry of the curvature of space-time, to topologically complex interactions between neurons in the brain, to the algebraic transformations describing symmetries of physical systems. Extracting knowledge from such non-Euclidean data necessitates a broader mathematical perspective. Echoing the 19th-century revolutions that gave rise to non-Euclidean geometry, an emerging line of research is redefining modern machine learning with non-Euclidean structures. Its goal: generalizing classical methods to unconventional data types with geometry, topology, and algebra. In this review, we provide an accessible gateway to this fast-growing field and propose a graphical taxonomy that integrates recent advances into an intuitive unified framework. We subsequently extract insights into current challenges and highlight exciting opportunities for future development in this field.

There is a discrepancy of about 10 dB between the experimental and simulated data in the level of the power response from the lunar surface. This implies that the simulator, as expected, is correctly estimating the scattering contribution from the pit, but underestimating the diffuse scattering contribution from the lunar surface by about 10 dB. However, this does not affect the general validity of the results. The large negative peak of the simulations corresponds to the interior of the pit.

The range of plausible slopes for which the correlation coefficient yields a high value is in line with what predicted by the radar geometric model for estimating the cave conduit slope from the radar image (see Methods).
