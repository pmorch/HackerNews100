        <p>On October 20th, my seven year old son Nikolas suffered cardiac arrest while undergoing a procedure at the hospital to treat an underlying congenital condition. The doctors performed CPR and succeeded in reviving him but ultimately he suffered catastrophic brain damage. My wife and I were in the hospital for nearly a month at his bedside as we awaited his ultimate prognosis.</p><p>What is there to say?</p><div><p><strong>First</strong>, I'm devastated. </p><p><strong>Second</strong>, I'm not going to be giving more details beyond what I write here for now.</p><p><strong>Third</strong>, I'll address those the most common questions, and concerns.</p></div><p><strong>Fourth</strong>, I'm making major changes to my life.</p><p><strong>Fifth</strong>, I will describe a bit about what this situation feels like from the inside. If you have not experienced this kind of tragedy, it will likely surprise you, as it did me.</p><h2 id="devastation">Devastation</h2><div><p>There's three things everybody says to me now:</p><p>"I can't imagine what you're going through."<br>"I don't know how you're handling it."<br>"That must be so hard."</p><p>These statements are true. If you haven't been through this, you don't get it. So let me tell you all about it. It'll be okay. Well, actually it's <em>not </em>okay, but it's okay that it's not okay.</p></div><p>My son is alive, but all of his higher mental functions have been wiped out. He still sleeps and wakes, breathes under his own power, and responds to certain stimuli, but he makes no intentional movements. He moves reflexively, and occasionally smiles and even laughs, but he can't speak and it's not clear what degree of awareness he still has of his situation, if any. The MRI results were conclusive that the damage was widespread and severe, and to such a degree that short of an outright miracle, there is no hope for regeneration through brain "plasticity" or any other known path towards recovery. People don't come back from this kind of injury.</p><p>That's important to say. I believe in miracles, but part and parcel of that belief is the acknowledgement that miracles are by definition rare, and the faith that God is able to grant them must be paired with a complete lack of presumption of receiving one (Daniel 3:17-18, emphases mine):</p><blockquote><sup>17</sup><strong> If it be so</strong>, our God whom we serve <strong>is able to deliver us </strong>from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.<br><sup>18</sup><strong> But if not,</strong> be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</blockquote><p>I would be delighted to hear Nikolas' voice calling out to me tomorrow morning, but I hold no lingering hope that this will happen. That's what it takes to get me through my day. </p><p>I'm reminded of one the little flavor quotes in Act VII in my game <em>Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten</em>:</p><figure><img src="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/2023/12/image-1.png" alt="Act VII: It is said that men fear death. In my experience, what men truly fear is the uncertainty of death. In all that ordeal, when death was certain, I was possessed by an unassailable calm I have never felt before or since. It was only when the hope of survival appeared that I felt the true grip of terror. - from the Memoirs of Gedemon Dalavbar, Master of Archers, being a History of his Adventures and Exploits in Service to the Ash King" loading="lazy" width="1704" height="960" srcset="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/image-1.png 600w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/12/image-1.png 1600w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/2023/12/image-1.png 1704w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My friend James Cavin, the game's writer, wrote those words over a decade ago, and I couldn't think of a better way to describe the strangeness of my current situation.</p><p>While hope yet remained, I suffered the most. The most devastating moment in the hospital was opening the MRI report. Up until then we were clinging to hope, and afterwards there was nothing left to do but to live with the loss. Our crushed hopes allow us to get on with the long road ahead.</p><p>As for "I can't imagine how hard that must be"–</p><p>Turns out, unfathomable tragic loss isn't very <em>hard</em>. It's <em>easy</em>, in fact. Easy in the same way that falling off a cliff is "easy"–gravity does all the work for you. It's not like climbing mount Everest, desperately putting one foot in front of the other. It's not like struggling to answer questions in a final exam. Tragic loss is just something that happens to you.</p><h2 id="its-not-hard-just-terrible">It's not hard, just terrible. </h2><p>The grief is different than people expect, too. I cried a lot, but after a certain point you only have so many tears left to cry. I can't cry all day, every day, for months on end.</p><p>And honestly, at this point crying feels <em>good</em>. Crying isn't really when I feel like I'm suffering the most, although I think people on the outside sort of had that expectation. There's this implicit assumption from other people that you will have a very legible grief, to "put on sad-face," so to speak.</p><p>But!</p><p>This isn't one of those essays where the author describes their personal suffering in great detail and then passively aggressively berates all the readers who haven't suffered to the exact same level for being somehow morally deficient, as has become vogue in the popular press over the last ten years.</p><p>Because guess what – two months ago I would have been <em>just like </em>most of you! Two months ago, if I were talking to someone who was in the position I find myself in now, I'd ask all the same "insensitive" and "inappropriate" questions, all the while being desperately afraid I was being insensitive and inappropriate. So everyone should just relax. I lost my son, it's terrible. No, you're not a bad person for asking me how I'm doing. Yes, everything's weird. I know you don't know what to say. I don't know what to say either. Nobody does. It's fine. </p><h2 id="what-were-in-for">What We're In For</h2><p>My son is alive, severely brain damaged, bedridden, and unable to care for himself. We took him off of all medical supports and moved him into home hospice care. This means that we stopped the artificial ventilator and IV's, as well as all medicines and treatments other than those aimed at comfort and pain relief, and moved him into a hospital bed we have installed at home. </p><p>The doctors initially thought he would quickly die after being taken off the ventilator, but he has persisted for about a month now. He receives food and water through a feeding tube, medicine for pain relief and comfort, and daily care from my wife and I as well as from hospice nurses who visit during the week. </p><p>The fact is, Nikolas could very well live for years or even decades to come, and my wife and I will take care of him up until that moment. We do not stand for euthanasia, but neither will we prolong his life through heroic and artificial life support measures. Food, water, comfort, and daily care–these he will receive from us, indefinitely.</p><p>This is not the sort of thing that can be easily outsourced unless I were to commit my son to a facility, which we will not do as it would drastically reduce our ability to see him on a daily basis. This puts a large daily burden of work, material expense, and restriction on personal freedom. We take this burden gladly.</p><p>Fortunately, we have been able to qualify for public medical assistance in this regard and it looks like we are going to be financially okay for the time being. I am grateful that I also have a strong private support network should I have to lean on it. <strong>To be 100% clear, I am not asking for money and I neither need nor want anyone to offer me any.</strong></p><h2 id="changes">Changes</h2><p>My nearly complete game, <em>Defender's Quest 2: Mists of Ruin</em> was originally supposed to ship at the end of 2023, but that's now been obviously delayed. I'm very grateful to our publisher, Armor Games, for being understanding in the midst of this tragedy.</p><p>A couple things are changing from the original plan before this all happened.</p><p><strong>First</strong>, this is the end of my professional game career. There will be a lot I have to say about this in the future, but the short version is with all the obligations I now have (particularly ongoing medical expenses) I am suddenly in the need of a much more stable, predictable, and boring career. I was successful early on, but as the years went by I found myself having to juggle development with any number of day jobs and side gigs due to the inherent instability of indie game development. I've loved my time in games, but I have to move on. I will write a post-mortem of my 10+ years in games sometime, as I have had some real accomplishments above and beyond the two Defender's Quest games that I am quite proud of to this day.</p><p><strong>Second</strong>, I am no longer a daily member of the DQ2 development team. This is particularly painful for me given that I was nearly at the end of a ten year journey for a game that's been in development since before any of my three children were born, but losing one of those children has upended my priorities.</p><p>But DQ2 is neither cancelled nor abandoned. </p><p>It was always Level Up Labs, LLC, not Lars Doucet, who bore the ultimate responsibility for the game's development, and I am but a part of that company. My co-founder, Anthony Pecorella, has heroically stepped up to the plate and coordinated the final stages of development in my absence. I am still in an advisory role and will make sure the final game is a good one, but I simply no longer have the capacity to do this with the new daily burdens in my life. I will try, if possible, to make sure we fulfill all of the pre-order campaign obligations (I've kept all the records), but I will ask for people's understandings if we fall short in certain regards or some of the goodies wind up being delayed. </p><p>As always, if you are unhappy with your preorder for any reason, email leveluplabs@gmail.com and we will cheerfully refund your money.</p><p><strong>Third</strong>, GameDataCrunch.com is officially defunct for good, at least under my direction. I still have all the source code, scripts, databases and other stuff for it, so anyone with decent web development skills (it's mostly just a pile of php, javascript, cron jobs, and MySQL) could easily resurrect it and keep it going. I have some people in mind for this already, but if you want to make your own pitch for why I should turn it over to you I'd be more than happy to hear it: email me at lars dot doucet at gmail dot com.</p><p><strong>Fourth</strong>, I now have one and only one job, which is working on real estate mass appraisal valuation technology for the purposes of accurately and credibly measuring the value of land separately from buildings and improvements. This is the kind of straightforward, steady, stable, boring work that I need to support my family right now. It also conveniently lines up with <a href="https://www.landisabigdeal.com/?ref=fortressofdoors.com" rel="noreferrer">my niche interests</a>.</p><p>And with that, I'm left with the new normal.</p><h2 id="its-strange">It's Strange</h2><p>I'm shocked at how quickly our family adapted to the situation. Our two girls (ages five and ten) have proved remarkably resilient, and help with Nikolas' daily care with eagerness and calm. We still read to him at bed time, pray with him, and sing his favorite songs. I know that he almost certainly can't hear us in his current physical form, and though I don't know how eternity relates to the physical world that's welded to the arrow of time, I like to think that Nikolas watches us from Heaven and hears us in that way (and perhaps I am watching there alongside him from the other side).</p><p>The best metaphor I can give for the daily home hospice care of your own seven year old son is a monastic vocation. It's menial work, tied to the hours of the day, an obligation and an obedience, for the rest of my life, or his, whichever comes first. Nikolas has becomes a living altar to his own memory.</p><p>I do not want to paint an overly rosy picture. I re-experience the trauma of losing him every time I see him, and it is deeply painful to see him in his reduced state. But all I have left to give him is my love, expressed in his daily care.</p><p>There are many costs, and not just in terms of time and money. My wife and I can no longer leave the house at the same time without finding someone with adequate training to watch over Nikolas while we are gone. I'm grateful that we were fairly boring homebound personalities, as this means we have been forced to give up much less than other couples would experience in this situation.</p><p>I won't be traveling much in the future, for obvious reasons, but we will find a way to make the most essential trips should the need arise.</p><p>The other thing I want to convey to people is that although I'm sad and experiencing a great loss, I cling relentlessly to joy. Since I was a small child I always hated a particular kind of tragic story, and I still feel that way today. I did not hate tragedies in general, or any story with a sad ending, but specifically the kind of story where not only does something terrible happen to beloved characters, but the kind of story where it's very obvious that the author is making some kind of nihilistic statement in doing so, sort of turning to face the reader, saying, <em>Now do you see, you naïve moron? Life is naught but pain, and you're a fool and a worm for not being as miserable as me!</em></p><p>Enough.</p><p>Look, the news media inundates us every day with endless tales of genuine horror and suffering, because in a world with billions of people <em>that will always be happening somewhere</em>. Life is and will always be fundamentally unfair, and the vale of tears filled with a never-ending parade of horrors. And yet, it's also true that for the median person on Earth, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better?ref=fortressofdoors.com" rel="noreferrer">life is much better today than ever before in human history</a>. </p><p>My own story is exactly one such example – the fact that I'm devastated to lose my son to a crippling injury highlights another fact–that this very thing has become so rare in my country as to be "unimaginable." We should rejoice at this! Losing a child used to be so unremarkably commonplace that <em>everyone</em>, even emperors and kings, routinely suffered it until approximately yesterday.</p><p>The correct adjective for the tragedy I'm experiencing is not "unimaginable" but <em>unfathomable</em>. I can imagine it just fine because it's happening to me, and you can imagine it too now because I'm describing it to you. And because we can imagine it, we can turn and face it, and, with God's grace, we can lift up our cross and bear it, somehow. </p><p>But what none of us can do is to measure–to <em>fathom–</em>the depth of it.</p><blockquote>Stand at the brink of the abyss of despair, and when you see that you cannot bear it anymore, draw back a little and have a cup of tea.<p>— Elder Sophrony of Essex</p></blockquote><figure><img src="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/2023/12/DALL-E-2023-12-02-15.50.18---A-serene--contemplative-scene-inspired-by-Elder-Sophrony-of-Essex-s-quote.-The-image-depicts-a-peaceful-landscape-with-a-deep--dark-abyss-in-the-backg-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/DALL-E-2023-12-02-15.50.18---A-serene--contemplative-scene-inspired-by-Elder-Sophrony-of-Essex-s-quote.-The-image-depicts-a-peaceful-landscape-with-a-deep--dark-abyss-in-the-backg-1.png 600w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/DALL-E-2023-12-02-15.50.18---A-serene--contemplative-scene-inspired-by-Elder-Sophrony-of-Essex-s-quote.-The-image-depicts-a-peaceful-landscape-with-a-deep--dark-abyss-in-the-backg-1.png 1000w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/2023/12/DALL-E-2023-12-02-15.50.18---A-serene--contemplative-scene-inspired-by-Elder-Sophrony-of-Essex-s-quote.-The-image-depicts-a-peaceful-landscape-with-a-deep--dark-abyss-in-the-backg-1.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>

<p>Private equity firms are increasingly buying hospitals across the US, and when they do, patients suffer, according to two separate reports. Specifically, the equity firms cut corners, slash services, lay off staff, lower quality of care, take on substantial debt, and reduce charity care, leading to lower ratings and more medical errors, the reports collectively find.</p>
<p>Last week, the financial watchdog organization Private Equity Stakeholder Project (PESP) released <a href="https://pestakeholder.org/news/new-report-details-harm-caused-to-healthcare-industry-by-apollo/">a repor</a>t delving into the state of two of the nation's largest hospital systems, Lifepoint and ScionHealth—both owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Through those two systems, Apollo runs 220 hospitals in 36 states, employing around 75,000 people.</p>
<p>The report found that some of Apollo's hospitals were among the worst in their respective states, based on a ranking by The Lown Institute Hospital Index. The index ranks hospitals and health systems based on health equity, value, and outcomes, PESP notes. The hospitals also have dismal readmission rates and government rankings. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ranks hospitals on a one-to-five star system, with the national average of 3.2 stars overall and about 30 percent of hospitals at two stars or below. Apollo's overall average is 2.8 stars, with nearly 40 percent of hospitals at two stars or below.</p>
<h2>Patterns</h2>
<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2813379">The other report</a>, a study published in JAMA late last month, found that the rate of serious medical errors and health complications increases among patients in the first few years after private equity firms take over. The study examined Medicare claims from 51 private equity-run hospitals and 259 matched control hospitals.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Specifically, the study, led by researchers at Harvard University, found that patients admitted to private equity-owned hospitals had a 25 percent increase in developing hospital-acquired conditions compared with patients in the control hospitals. In private equity hospitals, patients experienced a 27 percent increase in falls, a 38 percent increase in central-line bloodstream infections (despite placing 16 percent fewer central lines than control hospitals), and surgical site infections doubled.</p>
<p>"These findings heighten concerns about the implications of private equity on health care delivery," the authors concluded.</p>
<p>It also squares with PESP's investigation, which collected various data and media reports that could help explain how those medical errors could happen. The report found a pattern of cost-cutting and staff layoffs after private equity acquisition. In 2020, for instance, Lifepoint cut its annual salary and benefit costs by $166 million over the previous year and cut its supply costs by $54 million. Staff that remained at Apollo's hospitals were, in some cases, underpaid, and some hospitals cut services, including obstetric, pediatric, and psychiatric care.</p>
<p>Another pattern was that Apollo's hospitals were highly indebted. According to Moody's Investor Services, Apollo's ScionHealth has 5.8 times more debt than income to pay that debt off. Lifepoint's debt was 7.9 times its income. Private equity firms often take on excessive debt for leveraged buyouts, but this can lead cash to be diverted to interest payments instead of operational needs, PESP reported.</p>
<p>Apollo also made money off the hospitals in sale-leaseback transactions, in which it sold the land under the hospitals and then leased it back. In these cases, hospitals are left paying rent on land they used to own.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="Box">



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1747280541362102287/">Tim Sweeney, on Twitter/X, yesterday at 10:30am</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of today, developers can begin exercising their 
court-established right to tell US customers about better prices 
on the web. These awful Apple-mandated confusion screens are over 
and done forever. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That take didn’t last long.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1747408148799881390">Sweeney, yesterday at 7:00pm</a>, after Apple released <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/16/apple-guidelines-external-purchase-links">the details of its intended compliance</a> with the anti-steering (<em>anti-anti-steering</em>?) mandate from the Epic v. Apple case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A quick summary of glaring problems we’ve found so far: </p>

<ol>
<li>Apple has introduced an anticompetitive new 27% tax on web 
purchases. Apple has never done this before, and it kills price 
competition. Developers can’t offer digital items more cheaply 
on the web after paying a third-party payment processor 3-6% 
and paying this new 27% Apple Tax.</li>
</ol>

<p>[Sweeney’s points 2–4, complaining about Apple’s stringent design, 
presentation, and privacy demands regarding external links, 
omitted.] </p>

<p>Epic will contest Apple’s bad-faith compliance plan in 
District Court. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sweeney’s description makes it sound as though Apple is demanding its commission from all web sales for apps and services that have an iOS app. They’re not. They’re only demanding the commission from web sales that occur within 7 days of a user tapping through to the web from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-us/">the new External Purchase Links entitlement</a> in an app. Any app or service that already sells over the web, without paying a cent to Apple, can continue to do so in exactly the same way.</p>

<p>Also, Apple <em>has</em> done this before: what they announced yesterday is almost exactly in line <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/02/going_dutch">with their compliance with Netherlands regulations pertaining to dating apps in 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Before yesterday:</p>

<ul>
<li>iOS app developers could sell digital content and subscriptions over the web, without paying Apple any commission.</li>
<li>iOS apps outside <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/01/apple-anti-steering-relaxation">the “reader” category</a> could not link to, nor even tell users about, those web purchases from within their apps.</li>
</ul>

<p>After yesterday:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apps that wish to link to — or, I think, even inform users about — web purchasing options from within their iOS apps must (a) still offer Apple’s IAP for those items; (b) pay Apple its adjusted 27/12 percent commissions on web sales that come from inside iOS apps; (c) send Apple sales data monthly and submit to audits of their sales; and (d) follow Apple’s stringent design edicts for these in-app links to the web.</li>
<li>Apps that do not link out to their web stores from within their iOS apps using Apple’s new External Purchase Links entitlement can continue whatever they were doing before yesterday. For apps that do nothing new, Apple is collecting nothing new.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m only surprised that Sweeney was seemingly surprised by any of this. He genuinely seemed to think that Apple not only would, but <em>had to</em> allow links from within apps to the web for purchases without collecting any commission on those sales, and that developers could present those links however they chose.</p>

<p>I’m glad that Sweeney and Epic plan to contest this, because I’m genuinely curious whether Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers sees Apple’s solution as complying with her injunction against their prior anti-steering rules. But I think it <em>does</em> comply.</p>

<hr>

<p>To be clear, I think Apple should allow apps <em>other than games</em> to just tell users they can pay/buy/subscribe/whatever on the web, without any commission. That the rules which have applied only to “reader” apps since early 2022 should be extended to all apps other than games, perhaps alongside a requirement (which doesn’t apply to “reader” apps) that apps taking advantage of this <em>also</em> offer in-app purchasing.</p>

<p>I’d draw an exception for games — an exception that surely Sweeney would disagree with completely, given that he’s in the games business — because games are different, and hefty un-circumventable revenue commissions to platform owners are clearly standard for the video game industry. The iPhone and iPad are not PCs; they’re consoles for games and apps.</p>

<p>But I’m not sure at all that Apple is doing anything contrary to the law. Sweeney (and other critics of Apple’s stewardship of iOS as a tightly controlled console) believe Apple both shouldn’t and <em>legally can’t</em> comply with the anti-steering injunction this way. I only believe Apple shouldn’t, not that they legally can’t.</p>

<p>Most critics of Apple’s control over all iOS software are seemingly of the view that iPhones and iPads should, on principle, be largely like the Mac, where the App Store is an option, not the only game in town for software distribution. Personally, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/annotating_apples_anti-sideloading_white_paper">I am on the record wishing that Apple would allow some sort of “expert” or “developer” mode</a> — chock full of warnings, perhaps even requiring a developer account to enable — that would basically offer the same options for installing third-party software on iOS as there are on the Mac. That’s me, personally, an expert user. But even setting aside every penny of revenue generated by the App Store,<sup id="fnr1-2024-01-17"><a href="#fn1-2024-01-17">1</a></sup> I see and understand many of the reasons why Apple wouldn’t want to do this. There are a lot of Mac users whose Macs are overrun by adware and other scammy software. I’m not talking about viruses or malware, even — but apps that just abuse the largely free-for-all nature of the Mac platform.</p>

<p>Basically, there’s an argument that iOS devices should be more like traditional PCs (including the Mac), on ethical or moral grounds. The “<em>it’s my device, I should decide and control what software runs on it</em>” argument. I get it. But I also get that most consumers’ Windows PCs, and many Macs,<sup id="fnr2-2024-01-17"><a href="#fn2-2024-01-17">2</a></sup> are riddled with bad software (privacy invasive, resource hogging, and all sorts of <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/12/22/grammarly-disables-spell-checking-globally/">anti-user shenanigans</a> you’d never think of) that App Store policies forbid. App Store review is far from perfect — I mean come on, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/app+store+rejection">that should go without saying</a> — but it is undeniable that adversarial software is not a problem for <em>any</em> typical users on iOS. Nothing you install from the App Store can damage your iPhone or iPad experience. Nothing you install from the App Store is difficult to uninstall if you don’t like it. The same is true of dedicated game consoles like Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox — and to a lesser degree (because Google’s Play Store review seems comparatively lax) for Android.</p>

<p>But the cynical take is that it’s all about the money for Apple. Maybe the cynics are right! Let’s just concede that they are, and that Apple will only make decisions here that benefit its bottom line. My argument remains that Apple <em>should not</em> be pursuing this plan for complying with the anti-steering injunction by collecting commissions from web sales that initiate in-app. Whatever revenue Apple would lose to non-commissioned web sales (for non-games) is not worth the hit they are taking to the company’s brand and reputation — this move reeks of greed and avarice — nor the increased ire and scrutiny of regulators and legislators on the “anti-Big-Tech” hunt.</p>

<p>Apple should have been looking for ways to <em>lessen</em> regulatory and legislative pressure over the past few years, and in today’s climate that’s more true than ever. But instead, their stance has seemingly been “<em>Bring it on.</em>” Confrontational, not conciliatory, conceding not an inch. Rather than take a sure win with <em>most</em> of what they could want, Apple is seemingly hell-bent on trying to keep <em>everything</em>. To win in chess all you need is to capture your opponent’s king. Apple seemingly wants to capture every last piece on the board — even while playing in a tournament where the referees (regulators) are known to look askance at blatant poor sportsmanship (greed).</p>

<p>Apple’s calculus should be to balance its natural desire to book large amounts of revenue from the App Store with policies that to some degree <em>placate</em>, rather than antagonize, regulators and legislators. No matter what the sport, no matter what the letter of the rulebook says, it’s never a good idea to piss off the refs.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
      <article role="main">
        <p>Hi, welcome to the brand new website, HN Reads.  I enjoy reading <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> and I love buying books (and reading), and I also love data, so what better than doing some processing of data about books to find some interesting results?!  It also gives me the opportunity to write about books that I find interesting.</p>
<p>Here are the top 40 books recommended by HN readers in 2023.</p>
<p>How I generated this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>get stories that contain the word “book”, but not “macbook”, “chromebook”, etc. That were posted in 2023, and also try to only get “ask HN” stories, by excluding stories that have a url in them.</li>
<li>get the comments for the stories</li>
<li>for each comment, use the OpenAI gpt3.5 chat API to extract a list of book details in json format:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback"> 	 [
 	 	{"match":"xxx","title":"xxx", "author":"xxx", "link":"xxx"},
 	 	...
 	 ]
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>standardise titles, e.g. “Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid” is converted
to “Gödel, Escher, Bach”. Any leading “the” is also removed.  I end up with a title
column and an orig_title column in my data. If there are that have the same title, but different subtitles, for example “Javascript: the good parts” and “Javascript: the Definitive Guide”, this isn’t too much of a problem, as the authors are different.</li>
<li>aggregate the resulting information.  There was some manual adjustment to standardise
the book titles and authors names, for example Gödel was sometimes spelled “Godel”
and Douglas Hofstadter was sometimes returned as “Douglas R. Hofstadter”.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also shared some details about this process at <a href="https://blog.reyem.dev/post/extracting_hn_book_recommendations_with_chatgpt_vol_ii/">my blog</a>.</p>
<p>It’s nice to see one of my favourite series appearing on this list, the Hyperion Cantos. I don’t usually go for books with horror elements, but the story is so good, and the science
fiction elements are cool too.</p>
<p>A couple of controversial figures don’t rank in the top 40 of 2023:  Elon Musk’s new biography
wasn’t recommended once in an “Ask HN” about books, although there were plenty of stories
on Hacker News about him and Isaacson’s book.  Also Ayn Rand’s books weren’t mentioned often
enough in 2023 to make the list.</p>
<p>Without further delay, here’s the list:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><em>Context: When I was laid off from Google, I knew I'd be deluged with
questions.  I wrote this FAQ to share with friends and family, to
prevent repeated explanation.  But my other goal was to help so many
of my co-workers process and understand the repeated waves of mass
layoffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>What happened?</strong></p>
<p>Google just did another big round of layoffs.  I was part of them,
along with hundreds of others.  Many of us had long tenure or
seniority; my run was 18 years!</p>
<p><strong>Oh no!  But why were <em>you</em> targeted?</strong></p>
<p>I wasn’t personally targeted, I didn’t mess up.  In fact these layoffs
were extremely impersonal.  Google seems to be carrying out generic
initiatives to save operational cost.  I was an Engineering Director
with “only” 35 reports (rather than a typical 80+ people), and so it’s
likely that some heuristic decided that the business could do fine
without me.</p>
<p><strong>This is unfair!  After all you’ve done, how could Google do this to
you?</strong></p>
<p>Please understand: <em>Google is not a person.</em> It’s many groups of
people following locally-varying processes, rules, and culture.  To
that end, it makes no sense to either love or be angry at “Google”;
it’s not a consciousness, and it has no sense of duty nor debt.</p>
<p><strong>Are you OK?  I’m so sorry!  How are you coping?</strong></p>
<p>I’m fine.  :-) Google culture changed dramatically last year with its
first major round of layoffs, and I saw the writing on the wall.  I’ve
been preparing myself for this (increasingly inevitable) event for
months now – which included plenty of time for all the stages of
grief.  If anything, I have a mixed set of emotions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>enormous pride in building a Chicago Engineering office over
decades, and achieving really cool things in the Developer, Ads, and
Search divisions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deep gratitude in getting to work with some of the most intelligent,
creative people in the world;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a sense of relief.  The conflict between “uncomfortable culture” and
“golden handcuffs” was becoming intolerable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve seen long-tenured leaders exit Google and go into an identity
crisis; that’s not me.  :-)</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://www.red-bean.com/sussman/">zillion hobbies and shadow
careers</a> – plenty of things to do
and paths to follow.  The <em>first</em> order of business, however, is
probably a long-overdue sabbatical.  After 25+ years in tech, I need a
few months to rest and recover!</p>
<p>I’ll soon publish a couple of ‘post-mortem’ stories.  The first will
be about my own career at Google, and the second will be about how
I’ve seen Google culture change over time.</p>

<h2>A suspect</h2>

<p>I think the manufacturer of your son's ball mixed in a Swedish word:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2><em>Yxa</em></h2>
  
  <h3>Swedish, n.: <em>an axe</em></h3>
  
  <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNTu2.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNTu2.jpg" alt="See caption"></a><br>
  <sub>The photograph above is <a href="https://www.bukowskis.com/sv/auctions/562/48-elsa-beskow-j-julgran-och-y-yxa" rel="noreferrer">page 22</a> of the Swedish children's book <em>Vill du läsa I</em> ("Would you like to read [vol I]") by painter Elsa Beskow. The <code>J</code> above it is for <em>julgran</em>, the Swedish word for <em>Christmas tree</em>.</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Forensics</h2>

<p>I say this on the basis that:</p>

<ol>
<li>I checked several thesauruses, like you, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Axes" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia's category for axes</a>, and while I found <em>adze</em>, <em>chopper</em>, <em>cleaver</em>, <em>hatchet</em>, <em>mattock</em>, <em>tomahawk</em>, <em>twibill</em> and so on, I found nothing approaching a word with an initial <code>y</code>.</li>
<li>I used <a href="http://onelook.com/" rel="noreferrer">OneLook.com</a>'s reverse-dictionary functionality to search for "words starting with a <code>y</code> and having a meaning relating to <em>axe</em>"¹ and the only thing suggested was <a href="http://www.onelook.com/thesaurus/?s=axe&amp;f_sw=y&amp;loc=wildcard3" rel="noreferrer"><em>yataghan</em></a>: "a long Turkish knife with a curved blade having a single edge". An <a href="http://www.oriental-arms.com/photos/items/77/001477/ph-0.jpg" rel="noreferrer">image search</a> tells us that no ball-maker would confuse this sword-like blade for an axe.</li>
<li>Going one step further, I checked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Blade_weapons" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia's comprehensive list of bladed weapons</a>, and from all countries, throughout all history, only 3 start with an initial <code>y</code>: <em>yanmaodao</em> (Chinese), <em>yari</em> (Japanese), and <em>yatagan</em> (Turkish). These are all sword-like weapons, not axe-like, and as mentioned in the previous bullet, of the three, only <em>yatagan</em> has made it into English dictionaries.</li>
<li>I used an online tool named <em>Translatr</em> to translate both <em>axe</em> and <a href="http://translatr.varunmalhotra.xyz/?ref=producthunt" rel="noreferrer"><em>hatchet</em> into 90+ languages</a>, and cross-checked these with the manual translations on Wiktionary, and literally the only word of those ~200 options which started with a <code>y</code> was Swedish <em>yxa</em>. </li>
</ol>

<p>Cross-checking the translation from Swedish back into English confirmed that Swedish <em>yxa</em> is English <em>axe</em>. And indeed it is used in Swedish children's primers to illustrate the letter <code>y</code>, as you can see from the children's book excerpt above.</p>

<h2>The crime scene</h2>

<p>As for the other symbols on the ball, we can analyze which letter-symbol pairings make sense in each language. Here I've tagged each pairing with ✅ to indicate "the name a toddler would shout out for the depicted object starts with the corresponding letter", ❌ for "no, it doesn't", and ❓ for "this pairing merits further discussion".</p>

<p>In English, the pairings are <strong>A</strong>pple✅, <strong>B</strong>ear✅, <strong>C</strong>at✅, <strong>D</strong>og✅, <strong>E</strong>lephant✅, <strong>F</strong>rog✅, <strong>G</strong>iraffe✅, <strong>H</strong>ouse✅, <strong>I</strong>ce✅, <strong>J</strong>et✅, <strong>K</strong>angaroo✅, <strong>L</strong>ion✅, <strong>M</strong>ouse✅, <strong>N</strong>ail✅, <strong>O</strong>wl✅, <strong>P</strong>ig✅, <strong>Q</strong>ueen✅, <strong>R</strong>ainbow✅, <strong>S</strong>nail✅, <strong>T</strong>iger✅, <strong>U</strong>boat❓, <strong>V</strong>olcano✅, <strong>W</strong>orm✅, <strong>X</strong>ylophone✅, <strong>Y</strong> / axe❌, <strong>Z</strong>ebra✅.</p>

<p>In Swedish, these correspond to <strong>Ä</strong>pple❌, <strong>B</strong>jörn✅, <strong>K</strong>att❌, <strong>H</strong>und❌, <strong>E</strong>lefant✅, <strong>G</strong>roda❌, <strong>G</strong>iraff✅, <strong>H</strong>us✅, <strong>I</strong>s✅, <strong>J</strong>et✅, <strong>K</strong>änguru✅, <strong>L</strong>ejon✅, <strong>M</strong>us✅, <strong>S</strong>pik❓², <strong>U</strong>ggla❌, <strong>G</strong>ris❌, <strong>D</strong>rottning❌, <strong>R</strong>egnbåge✅, <strong>S</strong>nigel✅, <strong>T</strong>iger✅, <strong>U</strong>båt✅, <strong>V</strong>ulkan✅, <strong>M</strong>ask❌³, <strong>X</strong>ylofon✅, <strong>Y</strong>xa✅, <strong>Z</strong>ebra✅.</p>

<p>As you can see, because most of these words</p>

<ul>
<li>are loanwords to both languages (like <em>kangaroo</em> or <em>giraffe</em>), or</li>
<li>are loanwords from English to Swedish (like <em>jet[plane]</em>), or</li>
<li>have [proto-]Germanic roots shared by both English and Swedish (like <em>house</em> and <em>mouse</em>), or</li>
<li>are completely artificial coinages (like <em>xylophone</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>most pairings are sensible in both languages. </p>

<p>All told, in Swedish there are 8 words which simply do not fit, not to mention that, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment938521_395385">as @jkej points out</a>, a Swedish ball would also have to present the letters <code>Å</code>, <code>Ä</code> and <code>Ö</code>, and would possibly choose to omit <code>W</code>. This rules out the possibility that this is a ball made for the Swedish market.</p>

<p>For English, on the other hand, outside the mysterious <code>Y</code>, all the pairings use straightforward, non-suspicious common nouns an English-speaking toddler would be familiar with<sup>4</sup>. </p>

<p>Except for one. That <em>U-boat</em> is Swedish-fishy.</p>

<h2>A new clue</h2>

<p>Almost no one refers to submarines as U-boats in contemporary English. Quoting <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937798_395382">@tchrist's response</a> to that information:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... especially how a submarine or “U-boat” picture that got used for the U, <strong>given how uncommon a word for a sub that U-boat is in English these days</strong> — and to a toddler rather than to a great-grandfather who might actually remember them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is evidence against the maker of the ball being completely familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_As_She_Is_Spoke" rel="noreferrer">English as she is spoke</a>. </p>

<p>There's also positive evidence for "U" is for "U-boat" in Swedish children's primers. Quoting <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937595_395385">@jkej in the comments</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The submarine could be seen as circumstantial evidence (although not very strong) for some kind of Swedish mix-up explanation. Although U-boat is an English word, it seems a little strange to use it in this context. But <strong>in Swedish ubåt is the only word for submarine</strong>.  </p>
  
  <p>I used Google Image to examine some English alphabet posters and it seemed like almost all of them used umbrella or unicorn for U, but none of them used a U-Boat. Similarly, <strong>I found several Swedish alphabet posters with ubåt for U</strong>, although uggla (owl) was more common. <strong>I can also confirm that yxa was very common for Y</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And indeed it's easy to turn up Swedish pedagogical material having both <code>Y</code> = <em>yxa</em> and <code>U</code> = <em>ubåt</em>, like this one from the Swedish site <a href="http://www.imgrum.net/tag/barnteckning" rel="noreferrer">imgrum.com</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xzaQ9.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xzaQ9.jpg" alt="2x3 grid of letter-image pairs showing <code>T</code>-<code>Y</code>"></a></p>

<p>But it doesn't stop there.</p>

<h2>Following the footprints</h2>

<p>Following @jkej's lead on Fishpond.com, I found the manufacturer is <a href="http://www.ballbouncesport.com/" rel="noreferrer">Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc.</a><sup>5</sup></p>

<p>This is page 32 of <a href="http://www.ballbouncesport.com/catalog/flash/Default.html" rel="noreferrer">their online catalog</a> (you need to install Adobe Flash; their PDF catalog is broken<sup>6</sup>):</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QSulU.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QSulU.png" alt="page 32 of Hedstrom toy catalog"></a></p>

<p><sub>Item G: 54-4155; #10 <strong>A-Z Phonics</strong>; 0-33149 04155-9</sub></p>

<p>However, though Fishpond.com listed "Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc." as the ball's manufacturer, upon visiting BB&amp;S' site, one immediately notices the headers and copy all immediately point to another name:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ERe05.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ERe05.png" alt="Hedstrom logo"></a></p>

<p>Structurally, Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc. was once a subsidiary of <a href="http://hedstrom.com/" rel="noreferrer">Hedstrom</a>, and through a series of fits and starts in the last century, eventually <a href="http://www.sbnonline.com/article/how-jim-braeunig-took-ball-bounce-and-sport-from-bankruptcy-to-booming-business/" rel="noreferrer">took ownership of the Hedstrom brand</a>, and now is  <a href="http://www.ballbouncesport.com/olditems.php" rel="noreferrer">doing business as</a> Hedstrom.</p>

<p>That is, <em>Hedstrom</em> is the ball manufacturer's preferred name for branding purposes. Which is interesting, because the name "Hedstrom" is Scandinavian; per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedstrom" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia's article on the surname</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hedstrom</strong>, Hedström and Hedstrøm are surnames of <strong>Swedish</strong> and Norwegian origin</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Tailing the suspect</h2>

<p>So is the name <em>Hedstrom</em> indicative of Swedish influences on the ball's manufactoring process?</p>

<p>The <em>Smart Business</em> article linked above on BBS taking ownership of the the Hedstrom brand notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BBS owns 98 percent of U.S. and Canadian rubber ball markets and a growing percentage of the rotational molding market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No mention of international markets. However, one influence I can find of non–North American interests in Hedstrom is that these sources confirm that manufacturing is done in Asia, as other answers and comments suggest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BB&amp;S’s Hedstrom Entertainment Division makes play balls and other toys in Asia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what about Sweden? I've read <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:pxa2mVcNRgMJ:www.hedstromplastics.com/our-company/history/%20&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us" rel="noreferrer">several</a> <a href="http://hedstrom.com/about-us/" rel="noreferrer">different</a> <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20041012/news05/200014205/toy-maker-hedstrom-folds" rel="noreferrer">histories</a> of Hedstrom. The accounts are confusing and at points seemingly contradictory, involving many name changes. </p>

<p>But <a href="http://times-gazette.com/local%20news/2011/02/25/-big-three-carry-on" rel="noreferrer">the salient event</a> was in 1981:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eagle Rubber started making balloons out of a garage in 1916. The company grew and spawned an industry that led to Ashland becoming the balloon capital of the world. The company eventually added lines of plastic play balls. It was <strong>bought out by Hedstrom Inc. in 1981</strong>, which went bankrupt in 2004.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if Eagle was the company who built up the play ball business, whence the the acquiring company, Hedstrom? According to <a href="http://www.harryrinker.com/col-1163.html" rel="noreferrer">this column of Harry Rinker</a>, who is an antiques appraiser and thereby somewhat of an historian:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Carl H. Hedstrom, E. Gustaf Hedstrom, Knute W. Hedstrom</strong>, Wilfred P. Shuffleton, and Walter Beaman founded the Hedstrom Company, Gardner, Massachusets in 1915.<br>
  ...
  The Hedstrom Corporation still exists. Its Bedford plant produces outdoor gym sets, <strong>play balls</strong>, toys, etc.  The Dotham operation is toy focused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus the name <em>Hedstrom</em> originates from three Swedes in 1915. The catalog above is dated ~2012, and page 32 lists several of the playballs as <em>new</em>, but not the phonics one, so it's not clear when the ball was first produced. But certainly a century passed between the reason for naming the company <em>Hedstrom</em> and producing the ball. </p>

<p>So, with a century and countless mergers, bankruptcies, and restructurings intervening, the Swedish name <em>Hedstrom</em>, while intriguing, cannot be adduced as evidence that the <code>Y</code> stands for <em>yxa</em>.</p>

<h2>The interrogation</h2>

<p>I reached out to Hedstrom via their online contact form, Twitter, and Facebook. They replied to me this morning via Facebook:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2YQeQ.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2YQeQ.png" alt="Facebook reply from Hedstrom with photo of A-Z Phonics ball pairing a *yoyo* with <code>Y</code>"></a></p>

<p>They confirm your ball is not an official Hedstrom A-Z Phonics ball. The <strong>official ball has a yo-yo for the letter <code>Y</code></strong>. The Hedstrom ball also has a UPC and producer's mark.</p>

<p>Further, Hedstrom confirms they do no business internationally (outside Canada, one assumes), and they're not aware of any specific producers who have a known history of copying their designs. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoK23.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoK23.png" alt="Follow-up FB message from Hedstrom confirming they do no business internationally"></a></p>

<p>A second customer service representative actually responded separately to my contact via their website, instead of Facebook. She did her own forensics, and corroborated that Hedstrom's opinion is that this is a knock-off ball:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you for visiting our website and for your online inquiry about an ABC Playball.  Unfortunately, I do not believe this ball was manufactured by Hedstrom.  I've <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ziA9p.jpg" rel="noreferrer">attached an image from our QA files of our ball</a> for your reference.  <strong>Some of the things that tip me</strong> off that this is not our ball are the elephant and kangaroo colors.  Also, there is considerably more white space on you ball whereas ours has more designs.  So, just for fun, I visited our samples department hoping to find this ball and I was able to find and inflate a sample of our ball.  <strong>Our playball has a Yo-Yo for the letter "Y"</strong>.  Another way you can tell is whether or not there is an official Hedstrom legal patch.  This patch would contain our name, Hedstrom Corporation, our address, our website, made in China in three different languages, a UPC barcode with the number 0-33149-04155-9 and a four-digit date code.  Our inflation valve should be concealed in the Robot "R" picture, too.  I'm not sure if your ball has our legal patch or not or where your inflation valve is located, but these are just a few of the way we identify our products.  It's probably not impossible for another manufacturer to find and use our designs as these are rather old for us and are not licensed or trademarked.  </p>
  
  <p>Hope that helps solve the mystery for you.  <strong>But we are of the opinion that this is a knock off and not an official Hedstrom produced playball</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One last follow-up, and she shared the history of the ball, to the extent she was able to dig up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The records that I can still access tell me w<strong>e created this ball in 2004 and first sold it in 2005</strong>.  The last one was sold in 2008.  <strong>Our records don’t indicate ‘who’ might have been the designer at the time.</strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Going under cover</h2>

<p>So that trail runs cold. The ball is a knock-off.  Let's examine it in more detail for clues.</p>

<p>Indeed, additional analysis reveals that your ball and the Hedstrom ball are very similar, but not identical. There are some differences which have to be taken into account.</p>

<p>In particular, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937988_395385">@H Walters points out</a> that the layout — that is, the positions of the symbols relative to one another — are different in your photograph than in the catalog thumbnail for the Hedstrom ball:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>K</code> and <code>E</code> are shared designs between the two images. The neighborhood around <code>K</code> and <code>E</code> are very different, however; in the OP image <code>K</code> and <code>E</code> are adjacent and at each others' "9 o'clock" (<code>E</code> being oriented differently); <code>Q</code> is at <code>K</code>'s 6, and <code>Y</code> at K's 7. In the catalog <code>K</code> and <code>E</code> aren't even adjacent; we can see <code>E</code>'s entire neighborhood (from 1 to 12: <code>BMDGHL</code>), and <code>K</code>'s neighborhood that can be seen is <code>JIDA</code>. So at the very least, if they're the same ball, <code>K</code> and <code>E</code> are repeated, which makes little sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937988_395385">as @m69 further points out</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's not just that the lay-out is different; look at which part of the letter E is covered by the elephant's ear; that's different too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i5dwK.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i5dwK.png" alt="side-by-side comparison of Hedstrom and OP ball pictures"></a></p>

<p>Note also that in the photo of the ball that Hedstrom sent me, <code>V</code> is used for <em>vase</em>, not <em>volcano</em>, <code>R</code> is for <em>robot</em>, not <em>rainbow</em>, and the drawing of the nail for <code>N</code> is a slightly different style than on your ball.</p>

<h2>The stake-out</h2>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment941010_395385">at @jkej's prompting</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would add to the "circumstantial" evidence if we could find out the full set of pictures/words used on the original Hedstrom ball. Particularly, it would be very interesting if we could confirm that:   </p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>All words that are not sensible in English (i.e. Yxa and U-boat) were absent from the original.   </li>
  <li>All words not sensible in Swedish were present on the original.   </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>If (2) holds it is possible that all words added to the knock-off were taken from a Swedish source. Given the pictures of the original that we already have, we only need to confirm that <strong>O</strong>wl, <strong>Q</strong>ueen and <strong>W</strong>orm were on the original to prove (2).  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I asked my contact at Hedstrom, and she replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The ‘U’ has a red and white UMBRELLA.</strong>  The ‘O’ has a brown and yellow OWL.  The ‘Q’ has a QUEEN with white hair and a yellow crown with red &amp; blue jewels.  And ‘W’ is an orange and red WORM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on this, @jkej's analysis is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'd like to underscore that I think the answer from Hedstrom was a BIG step forward. It may seem like a dead end, but i<strong>t conclusively tells us that A) the pictures on the ball came from two distinctly separate sources, B) the general impression of an English ball can be fully explained by one of the sources, C) the pictures from the second source are better explained in Swedish.</strong> These were things we could only speculate about before. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>DNE evidence</h2>

<p>So a third-party made a knock-off version of the ball, not unusual in Asian manufacture, and introduced these differences, and perhaps picked up some Swedish contagion in the process.</p>

<p>To confirm that, we'll have to pick up the scent of this mysterious DNE you found near the valve of your ball.</p>

<p>But to do that, we have to start at the other end of the trail. I've reached out to Lojas França via email and Facebook. The email bounced, but there's still hope they'll reply on Facebook.</p>

<h2>A hot lead!</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, an informant, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385#comment941032_395385">@Brad Koch</a>, has it from some good sources in shady corners of the internet that <strong>the ball has been found</strong>. From <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14672359" rel="noreferrer">@thedrake on HackerNews</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I found the BALL manufacturer!!!!<br>
  <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Alphabets-print-ball_573748097.html" rel="noreferrer">https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Alphabets-print-ball_573748097.html</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIkLK.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIkLK.jpg" alt="ball pictures from Alibaba.com"></a></p>

<p>And what do we spy in the SW and SE corners of the right image (zoom in):</p>



<p>Our suspects! Hiding in China, right where our intelligence said they'd be.  And all the other images match as well.</p>

<p>Now to track down the manufacturer of these knock-off balls.</p>

<h2>The chase afoot</h2>

<p>From the Alibaba link, we find (one) producer of these balls is  Shanghai Jianhuiling Sporting Goods Co., Ltd. Tracking down <a href="http://www.hktdc.com/manufacturers-suppliers/Shanghai-Jianhuiling-Sporting-Goods-Company-Limited/en/1X03W4G8/" rel="noreferrer">the markets they operate in leads us to</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nature of Business: Exporter‚ Manufacturer<br>
  Industry: Toys &amp; Games<br>
  Product/Service Range: Toys and Games<br>
  Major Market(s):<br>
  • Eastern Europe<br>
  • <strong>Western Europe</strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>A final fingerprint</h2>

<p>So while Hedstrom is not responsible for the axe on your ball, there is one last piece of evidence that <code>Y</code>=<em>yxa</em>.</p>

<p>We find the ball again on <a href="https://www.pinterest.se/pin/431219733041038600/" rel="noreferrer">a Swedish user's Pinterest page</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CnJV3.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CnJV3.jpg" alt="A-Z Phonetics ball found on Swedish Pinterest page"></a></p>

<p>In fact, this one of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Alphabet&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbs=simg:CAQSlQEJBOaJ0JJxtOkaiQELEKjU2AQaAggKDAsQsIynCBpiCmAIAxIoshS3FKcKsxSmCqgKpxS4FJAK3h2bNZY1sSn2PfM9nTWeNfg9tiecKRowHvzPjflZDiTjoHy0QXGMFiZBvRMAdAuMrhEfdOmr0G6tIG58poQI734deofnHXWnIAQMCxCOrv4IGgoKCAgBEgT5_1KYbDA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin-rzPsNnUAhXMOiYKHdFPCh4Q2A4IJigB&amp;biw=1131&amp;bih=645" rel="noreferrer">only 3 sites</a> I could find anywhere on the Internet with an image of your ball<sup>7</sup>.</p>

<h2>Case <s>closed</s> open</h2>

<p>After all this, one thing is certain. Since the original designer of the ball, an American company whose employees are native speakers of English, used <em>yo-yo</em> to illustrate <code>y</code>, we know <strong>the intended word is not English</strong>.</p>

<p>Overall, adulteration of the ball with Swedish words seems indicated, though far from definitive.</p>

<p>But it's the best theory I've got. Except of course for <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture#comment937271_395382">@Vincent Fourmond's conclusion</a> that we're dealing here with a <strong><em><a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/markknopfler/yaketyaxe.html" rel="noreferrer">yakety axe</a></em></strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>¹ <sub> I also tried "and related to": <em>hatchet</em>, <em>chop</em>, and <em>cut</em>, even though the latter two words are verbs and all the other symbols on the child's ball represent concrete nouns. Nothing material emerged.</sub></p>

<p>² <sub>We could make a case for <em>N</em> also fitting for Swedish, as <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395711#comment938232_395382">@konaya points out</a>, by observing the depicted object could as easily be a tack, which is <strong><em>n</em></strong><em>ubb</em> in Swedish.</sub></p>

<p>³ <sub>Note that the <code>E</code> and <code>K</code> which are on the northermost latitude in the photograph have different orientations, and the symbol always has the same orientation as its letter (i.e., the top of the symbol shows you where the top of the letter is) so there is no concern that the <code>W</code> for <em>worm</em> might be <code>M</code> for <em>maggot</em> or anything.<p>I say this because I wondered for a moment whether the illustrator mistook <code>Y</code> for an upside-down <code>h</code> in <em>hatchet</em>.</p></sub></p>

<p><sub>With the cached Fishpond.com page in hand, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385#comment939363_395385">@H Walters did some source snooping</a> and noticed a number of references to the same number as in the Fishpond.com URL: 0033149041559. Many of these references were meta tags and hidden input fields, variously labelled <em>barcode</em> as in <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="barcode" value="0033149041559" id="barcode" /&gt;</code> or <em>gtin13</em> as in <code>&lt;meta itemprop='gtin13' content='0033149041559' /&gt;</code>. It also exactly matches the code in the catalog (see caption under catalog screenshot; there it is listed in component form <a href="http://www.pacificbarcode.com/all-about-barcodes/" rel="noreferrer">Indicator-Company Prefix–Item Reference-Check Digit</a>), and <a href="http://gepir.gs1.org/index.php/search-by-gtin" rel="noreferrer">a barcode search</a> confirms the company prefix 0033149 is indeed owned by Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc.</sub></p>

<p><sub>An interesting discrepancy, however. While the Fishpond.com and BBS catalog barcode item reference match (04155), the associated "part numbers" do not. The catalog shows 54-4155: that is, group number 54 (likely "decorated play balls"), species 4155 (same as bar code item reference, less the leading 0). But Fishpond.com shows  <em>Other Information:   54-4246T</em>, which is the same group number (54, decorated play balls), but <strong>a different species</strong> 4246T.</sub></p>

<p><sup>6</sup> <sub>And we also know the wholesale price per dozen as of April 2013 was $1.77, thanks to <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/e48a2f_fa8bb3b5c6a97bd7baf7118b822eafee.xls?dn%3DHedstromSpecialtyPriceListApril2013.xls" rel="noreferrer">this price sheet</a> (file name "HedstromSpecialtyPriceListApril2013.xls") tracked down by <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture#comment939485_395385">@Mari-Lou's UPC hunting skills</a>.</sub></p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lyo33.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lyo33.png" alt="2103 Hedstrom [Specialty] Price list"></a></p>

<p><sub>Note that the UPC / barcode is the same as in the catalog, 0-33149-04155-9, but the item number differs. The ~2012 catalog has 54-4155, but the 2013 price list has 54-4155<strong>4</strong>. This may be a typo, or it may be additional substantiation that one UPC may be used for different versions of the product.</sub></p>

<p><sup>7</sup> <sub>One potential risk here is that the Pinterest.se page was dynamically generated just for me, based on cookies set during the course of my research into "Swedish" and a young child's toy. Note the Swedish header translates to just a generic a "check out these fine products", and all the products offered are to toys for young children, related to reading, and all the descriptions are in English. But I think the risk here is low: I found the site through a reverse image search on Google, which suggests it pre-existed my research.</sub></p>

<p>In my teens and early 20s I was obsessed with the history of computing and the internet. I still am, but other obessions have reduced the relative weight of this interest. It was during those years that I made a regular pilgrimage to the <a href="http://w1mx.mit.edu/flea-at-mit/">MIT Flea Market</a>. I bought many of the components for my first computers there. I also found this important piece of computing history, a full set of 4.3 BSD manuals, Virtual VAX-11 Version from April, 1986.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed was that this set includes two identical copies of the index. It was a multi-user system, and having two copies of the index would have come in handy!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The index was prepared using an automatic indexing program written at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_Machines_Corporation">Thinking Machines Corporation</a>, Cambridge, MA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rest of the books all contain the familiar <code>nroff</code>-formatted manual pages, though some are much shorter than the ones you’ll find today in a modern UNIX-decendent’s <code>man</code> program.</p>

<p>The cover of each book features the familiar “Beastie” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_Daemon">Daemon</a> mascot with trident, representing “forking” of processes.</p>

<p>Inside the front cover reveals a really interesting connection between early UNIX systems and modern culture.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cover design by John Lassetter, Lucasfilm, Ltd.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s the same <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005124/">John Lassetter</a> who would later write and direct “Toy Story,” “A Bug’s Life,” and “Toy Story 2,” and “Cars,” and “Cars 2.” These books have a publishing date of April, 1986, and Pixar was spun off from Lucasfilm in February, so John was already there by that point. Lassetter wasn’t the first to draw this, but his version became the most popular.</p>

<h2><strong>Key Points / Summary</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li>An Eicher Motors premium calculator website on a Toyota Tsusho Insurance Broker India subdomain exposed Microsoft corporate cloud credentials.</li>



<li>The email sending API returned sending logs to the client, which contained the email account’s password.</li>



<li>The password could be used to log into the “noreplyeicher@ttibi.co.in” Microsoft email account. No two-factor authentication was enabled on the account.</li>



<li>The email account had a record of everything they have ever sent to their customers, which is: <strong>657k emails (~25 GB) containing things like customer information, insurance policy PDFs, password reset links, OTPs, and much more.</strong></li>



<li>Other Microsoft cloud resources were also accessible, including but not limited to the corporate directory, SharePoint, and Teams.</li>



<li>Toyota Tsusho Insurance Broker India took down the vulnerable API more than 2 months later after my report, but still have not changed the email account’s password.</li>
</ul>







<p>New year, new automaker industry hack! As part of my automaker research projects last summer, Eicher Motors made its way up my list to investigate. In my efforts to find interesting exploits on Eicher Motors systems, I accidentally ended up compromising a different company in the process: Toyota Tsusho Insurance Broker India (“TTIBI”). A perfect storm of multiple issues culminated in me gaining control over the “noreplyeicher@ttibi.co.in” Microsoft email account, which not only had a record of everything they have ever sent to their customers, but also provided a foothold into their Microsoft cloud.</p>



<h2><strong>Toyota Tsusho Insurance Broker India and Eicher Motors</strong></h2>



<figure><img src="https://eaton-works.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/VwwCqBIYNXeyNQwEQ8uyVQ/66cbbede-4182-43e8-e5b0-cbeafedf0f00/full" alt=""></figure>



<p>Everyone knows Toyota, but not everyone knows about <a href="https://ttibi.co.in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toyota Tsusho Insurance Broker India (“TTIBI”)</a>. Toyota is comprised of a vast network of different companies. TTIBI is under the Toyota Tsusho Insurance Management Corporation in Japan. TTIBI was established in 2008 and is “<a href="https://ttibi.co.in/?q=company" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a leading Insurance Broker across India</a>“.</p>



<p><a href="https://eicher.in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eicher Motors</a> is one of India’s leading automakers. They manufacture motorcycles under Royal Enfield Motors and commercial vehicles under VE Commercial Vehicles (VECV), which is a joint venture with Volvo Group.</p>



<p>Both companies have some type of insurance partnership because there is a <a href="https://eicher.ttibi.co.in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dedicated Eicher subdomain</a> on the TTIBI site.</p>



<h2><strong>The Premium Calculator</strong></h2>



<p>While analyzing the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.here.volvo.android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MY EICHER</a> Android app, I came across an inconspicuous URL inside an API interface Java class that was a link to a premium calculator:</p>



<figure><img src="https://eaton-works.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/VwwCqBIYNXeyNQwEQ8uyVQ/e546e650-f76f-4cc6-10d5-1e529f1fc900/full" alt=""></figure>



<p>Visiting the link in a browser revealed it:</p>



<figure><img src="https://eaton-works.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/VwwCqBIYNXeyNQwEQ8uyVQ/ec96c3c3-a0aa-4463-1cbf-372b351d0400/full" alt=""></figure>



<p>Looking at the source code of the website (literally right-click, view source), I quickly found some very interesting code:</p>



<figure><img src="https://eaton-works.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/VwwCqBIYNXeyNQwEQ8uyVQ/8876743e-b45a-489c-074b-83f2e0c50000/full" alt=""></figure>



<p>This caught my eye because this was a client-side email sending mechanism. If it worked, I could send a email with any subject &amp; body to anyone, and it would come from a genuine Eicher email address. However, seeing the Bearer Authorization put a damper on my excitement because it was clear you needed to be logged in somehow to use this API. Despite that, I decided to try crafting the API request to see what would happen. I was expecting it to come back with “401 – Unauthorized”, but what actually came back surprised me.</p>



<p>Not only did the email <a href="https://eaton-works.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/VwwCqBIYNXeyNQwEQ8uyVQ/74c92be7-f696-462c-c703-09908df3c400/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successfully send</a>, It came back with a server error that revealed an email sending log:</p>



<figure><img src="https://eaton-works.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/VwwCqBIYNXeyNQwEQ8uyVQ/8bb2c241-9205-466a-9048-8a4d2730a400/full" alt=""></figure>



<p>If you look closely, you can find the base64 encoded password. Being able to abuse this send email function was serious enough, but the leak of the email account password elevated this to a new level of severity.</p>



<h2><strong>The email account</strong></h2>



<p>This isn’t just any email account – it’s a noreply email account. noreply accounts are generally used for sending automated emails to customers. For example, when you reset a password, the link is likely to come from a noreply account. In many cases it can just be an alias on SendGrid, Postmark, etc, but it can also be an actual account that you can log in to. The noreply account could be the most important account in an organization because it could potentially have a record of everything they have ever sent to customers. In TTIBI’s case, that is exactly what it is and the amount of information revealed is enormous:</p>







<h2><strong>Exploring the impact</strong></h2>



<p>The email account is jam packed with personal/private information. To start, you can see all the insurance policies sent to customers – here’s a few examples from different insurance companies:</p>











<p>You could also view one-time-passwords (OTPs) and password reset links. With this, you could easily take over someone’s insurance account.</p>







<p>And you could of course access resources on their Microsoft cloud, such as the corporate directory, SharePoint, and Teams:</p>







<h2><strong>A perfect storm of security issues</strong></h2>



<p>The vulnerability was so severe because it was enabled by 5 unfortunate security issues/oversights. Developers and IT administrators should take note of all of these and make sure similar issues do not exist in your organization.</p>



<h3><strong>Issue #1: Client-side sending email mechanism</strong></h3>



<p>Don’t create an email sending function that the client has control over. Someone malicious can abuse it to send bad emails from your genuine account, leading to email reputation loss and phishing.</p>



<h3><strong>Issue #2: Missing API authentication</strong></h3>



<p>It looks like the frontend developer knew the email sending API should have been authenticated, but the backend developer missed the memo. If the server had actually checked the token, it might have entirely stopped this exploit.</p>



<h3><strong>Issue #3: Leaky API response</strong></h3>



<p>If something goes wrong when processing an API request, don’t give too much information back to the client. In this case a password managed to leak out, which is one of the worst things that could happen.</p>



<h3><strong>Issue #4: No two-factor authentication</strong></h3>



<p>Logging into the Microsoft account was surprisingly easy. There was no two-factor authentication set up or any other login verification prompts. If there was, it probably would not have been possible for me to successfully login.</p>



<h3><strong>Issue #5: Email retention</strong></h3>



<p>The final issue is that all emails the account had ever sent/received were retained, making it easy to access substantial amounts of customer information. Retention policies vary by industry, but this is a great example where having a policy in place could have softened the customer data exposure impact.</p>



<h2><strong>Password remains unchanged</strong></h2>



<p>More than 5 months later, TTIBI still have not changed the password of the email account despite being aware of the vulnerability. I checked it again today and I am still able to log in (<a href="https://eaton-works.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/VwwCqBIYNXeyNQwEQ8uyVQ/fb9faf44-82d6-46d3-dafc-b7bbcb147a00/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proof</a>). If I were them, I would not want a random stranger having access to their corporate cloud for 5 months. This is very disappointing, and I hope they improve their security posture so their customers’ data doesn’t leak out.</p>



<p>As an aside, I’m a little surprised that they weren’t alerted by Microsoft in some way to the unusual login. Or maybe they were, and the alert was ignored or not seen.</p>



<h2><strong>Timeline</strong></h2>



<p>TTIBI is not covered under <a href="https://hackerone.com/toyota?view_policy=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toyota’s HackerOne vulnerability disclosure program</a>, which is a shame because the team behind that has been quick to resolve <a href="https://eaton-works.com/2023/02/06/toyota-gspims-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several</a> <a href="https://eaton-works.com/2023/03/06/toyota-c360-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issues</a> I have reported to them in the past. I reported the issue to India’s <a href="https://www.cert-in.org.in/">CERT-In</a> instead.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>August 7, 2023:</strong> I send a comprehensive email to CERT-In to report the vulnerability.</li>



<li><strong>August 8, 2023:</strong> Response received from CERT-In. A case ID was issued, and they stated they will reach out to TTIBI.</li>



<li><strong>September 1, 2023:</strong> I ask for an update.</li>



<li><strong>September 6, 2023:</strong> Response received confirming they reported the vulnerability to TTIBI and will share further updates as they receive them.</li>



<li><strong>October 8, 2023:</strong> I noticed the affected website was taken offline. However, the vulnerable API was not. I inform CERT-In.</li>



<li><strong>October 11, 2023:</strong> Response received confirming TTIBI has fixed the vulnerability. I check this and confirm the vulnerability is <strong>not</strong> fixed.</li>



<li><strong>October 18, 2023:</strong> I noticed the vulnerability is now fixed – the email sending API now requires authentication. I ask CERT-In if TTIBI can offer a bug bounty reward.</li>
</ul>



<p>Everything after October 18 is a back-and-forth between CERT-In and me trying to determine if there would be a bug bounty reward. TTIBI never responded to the question, so I decided to close the case on December 22 and CERT-In sent me a nice <a href="https://eaton-works.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/VwwCqBIYNXeyNQwEQ8uyVQ/9bb02623-f19e-4223-d8e9-005c3d32a100/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appreciation letter</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>I knew the Association for Psychological Science, the American Psychological Association, the American Political Science Association, the American Statistical Association, and the National Academy of Sciences had problems.  It turns out the American Sociological Association does some bad things too.</p>
<p>Philip Cohen <a rel="nofollow" href="https://familyinequality.wordpress.com/2023/08/11/american-sociological-association-in-absentia-but-not-silent-on-open-science/">has the story</a>.  It starts back in 2019, when the American Sociological Association, along with “many other paywall-dependent academic societies” (in Cohen’s words) sent an open letter to the president to oppose open science.  Here’s Cohen:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the time, there was a rumor that OSTP [the U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy] would require agencies to make public the results of research funded by the federal government without a 12-month delay — the cherished “embargo” that allowed these associations to profit from delaying access to public knowledge . . . </p>
<p>They wrote: “We are writing to express our concerns about a possible change in federal policies that could significantly threaten a vibrant American scientific enterprise.” That is, by requiring free access to research, OSTP would threaten the “financial stability that enables us to support peer review that ensures the quality and integrity of the research enterprise.” If ASA lost their journal subscription profits, in other words, American science would die. “To take action to shorten the 12-month embargo… risks the continued international leadership for the U.S. scientific enterprise.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Uh huh.  I agree with Cohen that this is some combination of ridiculous and offensive.  He continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite a petition signed by many ASA members, and a resolution from its own Committee on Publications “to express opposition to the decision by the ASA to sign the December 18, 2019 letter” — which the ASA leadership never even publicly acknowledged — ASA has not uttered a word to alter its anachronistic and unpopular position.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s starting to make me wonder if academic cartels sometimes act like . . . cartels?</p>
<p>Just to be clear, this does not seem to be a problem with academic sociology as a profession.  As Cohen notes, the ASA’s own Committee on Publications opposed the ASA’s horrible recommendation to keep science closed.</p>
<p><strong>Putting it all into perspective</strong></p>
<p>We live in a world where political leaders start wars, companies and governments dump toxic waste, church leaders cover up child abuse, etc.  In comparison, universities and academic societies faking statistics, rewarding plagiarism and other scientific misconduct, restricting data, and otherwise mucking up the process of scholarly inquiry . . . that barely registers on the scale of institutionalized evil.</p>
<p>So what is it that’s so irritating about academic institutions behaving badly?  I can think of a few things:</p>
<p>1.  I work in academia so I’m made aware of these issues and feel some bit of collective responsibility for them.</p>
<p>2.  Academia is more open than much of business, government, and organized religion, so it’s easier for us to see the problems.</p>
<p>3.  So much of the enabling of cheating in academia just seems so pointless.  It’s not cool when companies pollute, but, hey, you can see the reason$ they’ll want to do so.  But what does the American Sociology Association get out of fighting against open science, what does the University of California get out of tolerating research misconduct, what do the American Statistical Association and American Political Science Association get out of giving rewards for plagiarists?  Nothing.  That’s what so damn pitiful.</p>
<p>When Lysenko did his part to destroy Soviet agriculture, at least he personally got something out of it.  These American Sociology Association etc dudes, they get nothing.</p>
<p>It’s really pitiful, when you think about it.  These people aren’t evil, they’re pathetic.</p>

Meta uses their serverless stack for non-user-facing functions.

Apple mentions how it’s “tempting</span></p><p>to provision and operate separate systems to store ‘small data’ and ‘big data.’” However, this increases operational complexity, and instead, they handle all types of data needs with one abstraction.

Application developers shouldn’t have to worry about scalability needs - that’s handled deeper down the stack by distributed system engineers.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Know your user. </strong><span>Each layer, API, and design decision provided by Meta and Apple is guided by clear knowledge on who the user of the specific technology is, whether it be an application development team or an observability team.</span></p></li></ul><p><a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html" rel="">Cassandra</a><span> is a wide-column NoSQL database management system. It was originally developed at Facebook to power the Facebook inbox search feature. Interestingly, Meta themselves have replaced much of their Cassandra usage with </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/08/06/core-infra/zippydb/" rel="">ZippyDB</a><span> instead.</span></p><p><span>iCloud is partly powered by Cassandra. Apple runs one of the largest Cassandra deployments in the world, </span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9307563" rel="">according to DataStax</a><span>. </span></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/erickramirezau/status/1578063811495477248" rel="">They report</a><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p>Over 300k instances/nodes</p></li><li><p>Hundreds of petabytes of data (if not exabytes)</p></li><li><p>Over 2 PB per cluster, with thousands of clusters</p></li><li><p>Millions of queries per second</p></li><li><p>Thousands of applications</p></li></ul><p><span>Other snippets of Cassandra in iCloud show that there are </span><strong>exabytes of data under management</strong><span>. </span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33124631#33136026" rel="">There are </a><strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33124631#33136026" rel="">multiple Cassandra nodes per server</a></strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33124631#33136026" rel="">, and the teams at Apple are smart about blast radius and sharding</a><span>. This makes sure iCloud data availability is near 100%.</span></p><p><span>Cassandra is still actively improved upon at Apple. Scott Andreas of Apple gave a talk about the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUxLJSFi2-A" rel="">future of Cassandra last month.</a><span> On Apple’s jobs page, they commonly mention Cassandra when hiring for distributed systems engineers.</span></p><p><strong><span>However, </span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/" rel="">CloudKit</a><span> + Cassandra ran into two scalability limitations, which led to their adoption of FoundationDB.</span></strong></p><ol><li><p><span>Within a single zone, </span><strong>only one operation can happen at a time</strong><span>, even if different records are being edited. This can be problematic for apps where multiple users or devices need to work on shared data simultaneously.</span></p></li><li><p><span>When updating multiple records simultaneously in an atomic operation, the updates are limited to a single Cassandra partition. </span><strong>These partitions have a maximum size they can handle, and as a partition's size increases, Cassandra tends to slow down.</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>FoundationDB and the Record Layer solved both of these issues.</strong></p><p><span>Apple is much more public about FoundationDB. They </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/24/apple-acquires-durable-database-company-foundationdb/" rel="">acquired FoundationDB in 2015</a><span> and have since published various papers detailing their use of FoundationDB.</span></p><p><a href="https://github.com/apple/foundationdb" rel="">FoundationDB</a><span> is an open-source, distributed, transactional key-value store. It’s designed to handle large volumes of data and works well for both read/write workloads and write-heavy workloads. It’s also </span><a href="https://www.swequiz.com/learn/acid-properties" rel="">ACID-compliant</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Apple uses the </span><strong><a href="https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer" rel="">FoundationDB Record Layer</a></strong><span> extensively for CloudKit (Apple’s cloud backend service).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>From their </span><a href="https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer" rel="">GitHub</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>The Record Layer is a Java API providing a record-oriented store on top of FoundationDB, (very) roughly equivalent to a simple relational database, featuring:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Structured types </strong><span>- Records are defined and stored in terms of </span><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/" rel="">protobuf</a><span> (Protocol Buffer) messages. Protocol Buffers were first designed by Google.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Indexes</strong><span> - The Record Layer supports a variety of different index types including value indexes (the kind provided by most databases), rank indexes, and aggregate indexes. Indexes and primary keys can be defined either via protobuf options or programmatically.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Complex types</strong><span> - Support for complex types, such as lists and nested records, including the ability to define indexes against such nested structures.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Queries</strong><span> - The Record Layer does not provide a query language, however it provides query APIs with the ability to scan, filter, and sort across one or more record types, and a query planner capable of automatic selection of indexes.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Many record stores, shared schema</strong><span> - The Record Layer provides the ability to support many discrete record store instances, all with a shared (and evolving) schema. For example, rather than modeling a single database in which to store all users' data, each user can be given their own record store, perhaps sharded across different FDB cluster instances.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Very light weight </strong><span>- The Record layer is designed to be used in a large, distributed, stateless environment. The time between opening a store and the first query is intended to be measured in milliseconds.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Extensible</strong><span> - New index types and custom index key expressions may be dynamically incorporated into a record store.</span></p></li></ul></blockquote><p><span>From the </span><a href="https://www.foundationdb.org/files/record-layer-paper.pdf" rel="">FoundationDB Record Layer</a><span> paper, they write:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“[FoundationDB Record Layer is used] to provide powerful abstractions to applications serving </span><strong>hundreds of millions of users</strong><span>. CloudKit uses the Record Layer to host </span><strong>billions of independent databases</strong><span>, many with a common schema.”</span></p></blockquote><p>The structure of FoundationDB, Record Layer, and CloudKit looks like this:</p><ul><li><p><strong>FoundationDB</strong><span> does all the distributed systems and concurrency control work. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>The Record Layer</strong><span> serves as a relational database to make FoundationDB easier to work with. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>CloudKit</strong><span> is the highest layer on top and provides features and APIs for application developers. CloudKit isn’t the only thing built on top of the Record Layer, but there are also other layers on top built internally for things that need structured storage, like a JSON document store.</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>The Record Layer allows Apple to support multi-tenancy at scale.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Actually, that’s somewhat underselling it.</p><p><span>The Record Layer is used for </span><strong>extreme multi-tenancy, where each user of each application gets independent record stores. This means the Record Layer hosts billions of independent databases sharing thousands of schemata.</strong></p><p>That’s better! And much, much more impressive.</p><p>The Record Layer is engineered to handle multi-tenancy at such a large scale thanks to two fundamental architectural decisions.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><span>The layer </span><strong>operates statelessly</strong><span> allowing for effortless scaling of the compute resources by simply adding more of these stateless instances. </span></p><ol><li><p>This stateless architecture simplifies the task for load balancers and routers since they only need to focus on the location of the data rather than the capabilities of the compute servers. Additionally, stateless servers have a reduced set of resources to distribute amongst clients.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><span>The layer uses </span><strong>record store abstraction to manage resource allocation and scalability</strong><span> effectively. This abstraction represents the entirety of a logical database, comprising serialized data, indexes, and the operational state. </span></p><ol><li><p>Each record store is allocated a specific key range, which guarantees logical separation of data for different tenants. Transferring a tenant's data, if necessary, becomes a straightforward process of relocating the assigned key range to a new cluster, as all the information required to manage and use the record store is contained within this range.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p><strong>In CloudKit, an application is represented by a 'logical container' which follows a defined schema.</strong><span> This schema outlines the necessary record types, fields, and indexes to enable efficient data retrieval and queries. </span><strong>Applications organize their data into 'zones'</strong><span> within CloudKit, which allows for grouping records logically for selective synchronization with client devices.</span></p><p><span>For each user, CloudKit designates a unique </span><strong>subspace in FoundationDB</strong><span>. Within this subspace, it creates a </span><strong>record store for each application a user interacts with.</strong><span> In essence, CloudKit manages a massive number of logical databases—multiplying the number of users by the number of applications—each containing its own set of records, indexes, and metadata, amounting to </span><strong>billions of databases.</strong></p><p><span>When CloudKit receives a request from a client device, it directs this request to an available </span><strong>CloudKit Service process via load balancing</strong><span>. This process then interacts with the specific Record Layer record store to fulfill the request.</span></p><p><span>CloudKit converts the defined application schema into a </span><strong>metadata definition within the Record Layer</strong><span>, which is stored in a separate metadata store. This metadata is augmented by CloudKit-specific system fields that track the </span><strong>record's creation, modification times, and the zone</strong><span> where the record is stored. Zone names are prefixed to primary keys to enable efficient access to records within each zone. Alongside indexes defined by the user, CloudKit also manages </span><strong>'system indexes'</strong><span> for internal purposes like managing storage quotas by keeping an index that tracks the size of records by their type.</span></p><p><strong>FoundationDB and the Record Layer together solve 4 key problems for Apple that either Cassandra alone or FoundationDB alone could not.</strong></p><p>FoundationDB helps solve personalized full-text search for users to quickly access their data.</p><p><span>Their system utilizes </span><strong>FoundationDB's key order</strong><span> to allow for quick searches on text beginnings (</span><strong>prefix matching</strong><span>) and also for more complex searches (like finding words that are close together or in a specific order - </span><strong>proximity and phrase search</strong><span>) without no extra overhead.</span></p><p>In traditional search systems, you often need extra processes running in the background to keep the search index up to date, but Apple’s system does everything in real-time, which means as soon as data changes, the search index is updated instantly—no extra steps needed.&nbsp;</p><p>With FoundationDB, CloudKit handles many updates happening simultaneously in a smooth way.</p><p>Previously, with Cassandra, CloudKit used to rely on a special index that kept track of changes in each zone to synchronize data across devices. When a device needed to update its data, it would check this index to see what's new. But this system had a drawback: it could cause conflicts when multiple updates happened at the same time.</p><p><span>But with FoundationDB, CloudKit uses a special kind of index that keeps track of the exact sequence of each change without causing conflicts. This is done by </span><strong>assigning a unique 'version' to every change, and when CloudKit needs to sync, it looks at these versions to figure out what updates a device has missed.</strong></p><p>However, when CloudKit needs to move data across different storage clusters—perhaps to distribute the load more evenly—things get tricky because each cluster has its own version numbers that don't match up. To solve this, CloudKit gives each user's data a 'move count' (called the “incarnation”), which increases every time their data is transferred to a new cluster. Each record update includes the user's current “incarnation” number, ensuring that even after a move, CloudKit can still figure out the correct order of updates by looking at both the incarnation and version numbers.</p><p>When they switched to this new system, CloudKit faced the challenge of dealing with old data that didn't have these version numbers. They cleverly overcame this by using a special function that sorts old updates using the previous system before the new ones. This meant no complicated changes to the app or leaving behind outdated code. This function took into account the incarnation, version, and the old update-counter values to maintain the correct order of records.</p><p><span>FoundationDB is designed for high-concurrency, not low latency. This means it can </span><strong>handle a lot of tasks at the same time rather than focus on the speed of individual tasks.</strong></p><p><span>To make the most of this design, </span><strong>the Record Layer does a lot of its work 'asynchronously'</strong><span>— it queues up tasks to be completed in the future, allowing for other work to be done in the meantime. This approach helps to cover up any delays that might occur during these tasks.</span></p><p><span>However, the tool that FoundationDB uses to communicate with its database is designed to do one thing at a time using a single thread for networking. In earlier versions, this setup caused a traffic jam in the system because everything was waiting for its turn in this network thread. </span><strong>The Record Layer had been using this single-threaded approach, which led to a bottleneck.</strong></p><p><span>To improve this, Apple reduced the workload on this network thread. </span><strong>Now, complex tasks seem faster because the system is working with the database on several fronts at the same time, rather than forming a queue.</strong><span> This way, the latency, or the apparent slowness, is hidden because the system doesn't wait for one task to finish before starting another.</span></p><p><span>In FoundationDB, if one transaction is reading certain keys and another transaction modifies those same keys at the same time, it causes a 'transaction conflict'. </span><strong>FoundationDB allows precise management of these conflicts by providing control over the sets of keys that can cause these conflicts when read or written to.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>A common method to avoid unnecessary conflicts is to perform a special kind of read that doesn't cause conflicts, known as a 'snapshot' read, on a range of keys. If this read finds important keys, the transaction will only flag those specific keys for potential conflict, rather than the entire range. This ensures the transaction is only affected by changes that actually matter to its outcome.</p><p><span>The Record Layer uses this strategy to efficiently manage a structure known as a skip list, which is part of its ranking index system. However, manually setting these conflict ranges can be tricky and can lead to bugs that are difficult to identify, especially when they're mixed in with the main logic of the application. Therefore, </span><strong>it's recommended that systems built on top of FoundationDB create higher-level tools, like custom indexes, to handle these patterns</strong><span>. This approach helps to avoid leaving the responsibility to relax conflict rules up to each client application, which could lead to mistakes and inconsistencies.</span></p><p><span>Thanks for reading!

<section id="the-start-of-my-obsidian-journey">
<h2>The start of my <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> journey</h2>
<p>21 January 2021, that’s the date I created in my first note in my <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> vault. Back then, it was just an experiment in my ongoing quest to find the perfect note-taking tool. <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, and even the good ol’ <a href="https://www.zebrapen.com/blogs/enlightened-writing/4-reasons-to-keep-writing-with-a-pen-and-paper">pen and paper</a> took their turns on my desk. But ever since I started using Obsidian, I never used another tool again. Since that day, Obsidian has been my constant companion through learning adventures, career changes, study sessions, and moments of personal reflection. What started as a simple app transformed into an indispensable tool, the backstage manager of my life, keeping everything in check.</p>
</section>
<section id="obsidians-features">
<h2>Obsidian’s Features</h2>
<p>What really makes Obsidian unique? I think it boils down to 3 features:</p>
<section id="obsidian-allows-structure-to-grow-organically">
<h2 data-anchor-id="obsidian-allows-structure-to-grow-organically">1. Obsidian allows structure to grow organically</h2>
<p>Most note-taking tools require you to decide upon the structure of your note before you record the note. For example, say I am taking notes while going through one of deeplearning.ai’s excellent <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-with-llms/">Generative AI LLM courses</a>, before writing down my notes, I might have to decide on my folder structure.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should structure my notes by their topic</p>
<pre><code>├── Instruction Fine Tuning
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── Single Task
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── Multi Task
├── Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)
├── Low Rank Adaption of LLMs (LoRA)
├── Model Evaluation Metrics
 &nbsp;&nbsp; └── LLM benchmarks</code></pre>
<p>Or perhaps I should structure my notes based by date so I can track my learning progress over time</p>
<pre><code>├── 2024-01-01
├── 2024-01-02
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── Instruction Fine Tuning
├── 2024-01-03
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)
├── 2024-01-04
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── Low Rank Adaption of LLMs (LoRA)
└── 2024-01-05</code></pre>
<p>Either way could be valid, depending on how I plan to revise and reorganise my notes in the future. But having to decide upon a structure upfront before I get the chance to start recording my notes never feels good.</p>
<section id="internal-links">
<h3 data-anchor-id="internal-links">Internal Links</h3>
<p>Obsidian offers a powerful feature to solve this problem - <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links">Internal Links</a>. Here is an example of Internal Links in action: <img src="https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/obsidian/internal-link-example.png"></p>
<p>By wrapping any idea/noun/topic in double <code>[[]]</code> brackets Obsidian creates a dedicated new notes for that item, as well as the connection between the note I am currently taking and the one that was just created. In this short paragraph, I have linked both a date <code>2024-01-02</code> and several key topics e.g.&nbsp;(<code>In-context learning</code>), which means that when I want to revisit or reorganise my notes, I can do so either by topic or by date.</p>

<div><p>With internal links, I enjoy keeping my notes in a flat hierachy but I have seen vaults that still prefer folders. Obsidian supports both preferences equally well 🙂</p></div><p>This flexibility enables me to build my vault out with an organic structure that adapts to my learning needs.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="obsidian-helps-me-link-atomic-ideas-into-greater-understanding">
<h2 data-anchor-id="obsidian-helps-me-link-atomic-ideas-into-greater-understanding">2. Obsidian helps me link atomic ideas into greater understanding</h2>
<p>Knowledge is a mosaic crafted from interconnected ideas.</p>
<div>
<ul role="tablist"><li role="presentation"><a id="tabset-1-1-tab" data-bs-toggle="tab" data-bs-target="#tabset-1-1" role="tab" aria-controls="tabset-1-1" aria-selected="true">What my vault started as</a></li><li role="presentation"><a id="tabset-1-2-tab" data-bs-toggle="tab" data-bs-target="#tabset-1-2" role="tab" aria-controls="tabset-1-2" aria-selected="false">What my vault grew into</a></li></ul>
<div>
<div id="tabset-1-1" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tabset-1-1-tab">
<p><img src="https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/obsidian/graph1.png"></p>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view">graph view</a> of my Obsidian vault in my 1st year. Every node in this graph is a single note. It is clear that when I was first starting out, I was writing down disparate, unconnected notes. I was probably writing down a lot of interesting ideas, but I had not taken the time to connect these ideas to gain a broader understanding.</p>
</div>
<div id="tabset-1-2" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tabset-1-2-tab">
<p><img src="https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/obsidian/graph2.png"></p>
<p>As I continued using Obsidian, I started to link notes together. This could be done either when the notew was first created, or when I scheduled time to review these notes again. Soon, I saw clusters of ideas organically forming into broader topics. My <a href="https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/2022scala/">deep dive into Scala</a>, my <a href="https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/2023-causal-inference/">exploration of Causal Inference</a> and a whole variety of subjects that interest me came out of these clusters. And today, I have a nice graphical topology of sorts that represents my learning journey and keeps me motivated.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="obsidians-choice-to-work-with-plain-text-files-make-it-future-proof">
<h2 data-anchor-id="obsidians-choice-to-work-with-plain-text-files-make-it-future-proof">3. Obsidian’s choice to work with plain text files make it future-proof</h2>
<p>Lastly, my favourite feature of Obsidian is that by deafault, it chooses to work with plain text files. This simple decision means that Obsidian notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be used offline</li>
<li>Can be editted with any text editor</li>
<li>Can be viewed with a variety of text readers</li>
<li>Can be easily synced on iCloud, Dropbox or using git</li>
<li>Is yours, forever!</li>
</ul>
<p>Obsidian’s CEO Steph Ango wrote a <a href="https://stephango.com/file-over-app">dedicated blog post on this philosophy</a> that went deeper into this philosophy. He shared that <em>all software is ephemeral and Obsidian wants to give people ownership over their own data</em>, which is an approach that builds trust for its users.</p>

    <p><img src="https://jyn.dev/assets/burned%20out%20rust%20club.png" alt="a melting, smiling, ferris. it's surrounded by the cursive text &quot;burned out rust kid club&quot;."></p>

<p>the number of people who have left the rust project due to burnout is shockingly high. the number of people in the project who are close to burnout is also shockingly high.</p>

<p>this post is about myself, but it’s not just about myself. i’m not going to name names because either you know what i’m talking about, in which case you know <em>at least</em> five people matching this description, or you don’t, in which case sorry but you’re not the target audience. consider, though, that the project has been around for 15 years, and compare that to the average time a maintainer has been active …</p>

<h2 id="what-does-this-look-like">what does this look like</h2>

<p>(i apologize in advance if this story does not match your experience; hopefully the suggestions on what to do about burnout will still be helpful to you.)</p>

<p>the pattern usually goes something like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you want to work on rust. you go to look at the issue tracker. you find something <em>you</em> care about, since the easy/mentored issues are taken. it’s hard to find a mentor because all the experienced people are overworked and burned out, so you end up doing a lot of the work independently.</li>
</ul>

<p>guess what you’ve already learned at this point: work in this project doesn’t happen unless <em>you personally</em> drive it forward. that issue you fixed was opened for years; the majority of issues you will work on as you start will have been open for months.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you become a more active contributor. the existing maintainer is too burned out to do regular triage, so you end up going through the issue backlog (usually, you’re the first person to have done so in years). this reinforces the belief work doesn’t happen unless <em>you</em> do it <em>personally</em>.</li>
  <li>the existing maintainer recognizes your work and turns over a lot of the responsibilities to you, especially reviews. new contributors make PRs. they make silly simple mistakes due to lack of experience; you point them out and they get fixed. this can be fun, for a time. what it’s teaching you is that <em>you personally</em> are responsible for catching mistakes.</li>
  <li>you get tired. you’ve been doing this for a while. people keep making the same mistakes, and you’re afraid to trust other reviewers; perhaps you’re the <em>only</em> reviewer, or other reviewers have let things slip before and you don’t trust their judgement as much as you used to. perhaps you’re assigned too many PRs and you can’t keep up. you haven’t worked on the things you <em>want</em> to work on in weeks, and no one else is working on them because you said you were going to (“they won’t happen unless <em>you do them personally</em>”, a voice says). you want a break, but you have a voice in the back of your head: “the project would be worse without you”.</li>
</ul>

<p>i’m going to stop here; i think everyone gets the idea.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-i-do-about-it">what can i do about it</h2>

<p>“it won’t get done if i don’t do it” and “i need to review everything or stuff will slip through” is exactly the mindset of my own burnout from rust. it doesn’t matter if it’s true, it will cause you pain. if the project cannot survive without <em>you personally</em> putting in unpaid overtime, perhaps it does not deserve to survive.</p>

<p>if you are paid to work on rust, you likely started as an unpaid contributor and got the job later. <em>treat it like a job now</em>. do not work overtime; do not volunteer at every turn; do not work on things far outside your job description.</p>

<p>the best way to help the project is to keep contributing for it for years. to do that, you have to avoid burning out, which means you have to <em>treat yourself well</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-team-leads-do-about-it">what can team leads do about it</h2>

<p>have documentation for “what to do about burnout”; give it just as much priority as technical issues or moderation conflicts.</p>

<p>rotate responsibilities. don’t have the same person assigned to the majority of PRs. if they review other people’s PRs unsolicited, talk to them 1-1 about why they feel the need to do so. if someone is assigned to the review queue and never reviews PRs, talk to them; take them off the queue; give them a vacation or different responsibilities as appropriate.</p>

<p>ask people why they leave. i know at least one person whose burnout story does not match the one in this post. i am sure there are others. you cannot solve a problem if you don’t understand what causes it.</p>

<p><em>take these problems seriously</em>. <a href="https://jyn.dev/2023/12/04/How-to-maintain-an-open-source-project.html">prioritize growing the team and creating a healthy environment over solving technical issues</a>. <strong>the issues will still be there in a few months; your people may not be</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-the-rust-project-do-about-it">what can the rust project do about it</h2>

<p>one thing bothering me as i wrote this post is how much of this still falls on individuals within the project. i don’t think this is an individual problem; i think it is a cultural, organizational, and resource problem. i may write more about this once i have concrete ideas about what the project could do.</p>

<h2 id="be-well-be-kind-to-each-other-i-love-you">be well. be kind to each other. i love you.</h2>

<p><em>If you find this piece worthwhile, <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-fight-against-cancer-with-jake-s">consider the Go Fund Me</a> that’s funding ongoing cancer care.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://danluu.com/teach-debugging/">A story from Dan Luu</a>, from back when he “TA’ed EE 202, a second year class on signals and systems at Purdue:”</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>When I suggested to the professor that he spend half an hour reviewing algebra for those students who never had the material covered cogently in high school, I was told in no uncertain terms that it would be a waste of time because some people just can’t hack it in engineering. I was told that I wouldn’t be so naive once the semester was done, because some people just can’t hack it in engineering.</em></p>



<p>This matches my experiences: when I was a first-year grad student in English,<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> my advisor was complaining about his students not knowing how to use commas, and I made a suggestion very similar to Luu’s: “Why not teach commas?” His reasoning was slightly different from “some people just can’t hack it in engineering,” in that he thought students should’ve learned comma usage in high school. I argued that, while he might be right in theory, if the students don’t know how to use commas, he ought to teach them how. He looked at me like I was a little dim and said “no.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I thought and still think he’s wrong.</p>



<p>If a person doesn’t know fundamentals of a given field, and particularly if a larger group doesn’t, teach those fundamentals.<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> I’ve taught commas and semicolons to students almost every semester I’ve taught in college, and it’s neither time consuming nor hard. A lot of the students appreciate it and say no one has ever stopped to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Usually I ask, when the first or second draft of their paper is due for peer editing, that students write down four major comma rules and a sample sentence showcasing each. I’m looking for something like: connecting two independent clauses (aka complete sentences) with a coordinating conjunction (like “and” or “or”), offsetting a dependent word, clause, or phase (“When John picked up the knife, …”), as a parenthetical (sometimes called “appositives” for reasons not obvious to me but probably having something to do with Latin), and lists. Students often know about lists (“John went to the store and bought mango, avocado, and shrimp”), but the other three elude them.</p>



<p>I don’t obsess with the way the rules are phrased and if the student has gotten the gist of the idea, that’s sufficient. They write for a few minutes, then I walk around and look at their answers and offer a bit of individual feedback. Ideally, I have some chocolate and give the winner or sometimes winners a treat. After, we go over the rules as a class. I repeat this three times, for each major paper. Students sometimes come up with funny example sentences. The goal is to rapidly learn and recall the material, then move on. There aren’t formal grades or punishments, but most students try in part because they know I’m coming around to read their answers.</p>



<p>We do semicolons, too—they’re used to conjoin related independent clauses without a coordinating conjunction, or to separate complex lists. I’ll use an example sentence of unrelated independent clauses like “I went to the grocery store; there is no god.”</p>



<p>I tell students that, once they know comma rules, they can break them, as I did in the previous paragraph. I don’t get into smaller, less important comma rules, which are covered by whatever book I assign students, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Write-Right-Desktop-Punctuation-Grammar/dp/1580083285?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thstsst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><em>Write Right!</em></a>.</p>



<p>Humanities classes almost never teach editing, either, which I find bizarre.&nbsp;I suspect that editing is to debugging as writing is to programming (or hardware design): essential. I usually teach editing at the sentence level, by collecting example sentences from student journals, then putting them on the board and asking students: “what would you do with this sentence, and why?” I walk around to read answers and offer brief feedback or tips. These are, to my mind, fundamental skills. Sentences I’ve used in the past include ones like this, regarding a chapter from Alain de Botton’s novel <em>On Love</em>: “Revealed in ‘Marxism,’ those who are satisfying a desire are not experiencing love rather they are using the concept to give themselves a purpose.” Or: “Contrast is something that most people find most intriguing.” These sentences are representative of the ones first- and second-year undergrads tend to produce at first.</p>



<p>I showed <a href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/">Bess</a> an early version of this essay, and it turns out she had experiences similar to Luu’s, but at Arizona State University (ASU):</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>My O-chem professor was teaching us all something new, but he told me to quit when I didn’t just understand it immediately and was struggling. He had daily office hours, and I was determined to figure out the material, so I kept showing up. He wanted to appear helpful, but then acted resentful when I asked questions, “wasting his time” with topics from which he’d already moved on, and which I “should already understand”.</em></p>



<p><em>He suggested I drop the class, because “O-Chem is just too much for some people.” When I got the second-highest grade in the class two semesters in a row, he refused to write me a letter of recommendation because it had been so hard for me to initially grasp the material, despite the fact that I now thought fluently in it. My need for extra assistance to grasp the basics somehow overshadowed the fact that I became adept, and eventually offered tutoring for the course (where I hope I was kinder and more helpful to students than he was).</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Regarding Bess’s organic chemistry story, I’m reminded of a section from David Epstein’s book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214506?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thstsst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Range: How Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World</a></em>. In his chapter “Learning, Fast and Slow” Epstein writes that “for learning that is both durable (it sticks) and flexible (it can be applied broadly), <em>fast and easy</em> is precisely the problem” (85). Instead, it’s important to encounter “desirable difficulties,” or “obstacles that make learning more challenging, slower, and more frustrating in the short term, but better in the long term.” According to Epstein, students like Bess are often the ones who master the material and go on to be able to apply it. How many students has that professor foolishly discouraged? Has he ever read <em>Range</em>? Maybe he should.</p>



<p>Bess went on: &nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Dan’s story also reminds me of an attending doctor in my emergency medicine program; she judged residents on what they already knew and thought negatively of ones who, like me, asked a bunch of questions. But how else are you supposed to learn? This woman (I’m tempted to use a less-nice word) considered a good resident one who’d either already been taught the information during medical school, or, more likely, pretended to know it. </em></p>



<p><em>She saw the desire to learn and be taught—the point of a medical residency— as an inconvenience (hers) and a weakness (ours). Residency should be about gaining a firm foundation in an environment ostensibly about education, but turns out it’s really about cheap labor, posturing, and also some education where you can pick it up off the floor. When I see hospitals claiming that residency is about education, not work, I laugh. Everyone knows that argument is bullshit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>We can and should do a better job of teaching fundamentals, though I don’t see a lot of incentive to do so in formal settings. In most K – 12 public schools, after one to three years most teachers can’t effectively be fired, due to union rules, so the incentive to be good, let alone great, is weak. In universities, a lot of professors are, as I noted earlier, hired for research, not teaching. It’s possible that, as charter schools spread, we’ll see more experimentation and improvement at the ˚K –12 level. At the college and graduate school level, I’d love to see more efforts at instructional and institutional experimentation and diversity, but apart from the <a href="https://www.uaustin.org/">University of Austin</a>, <a href="https://www.minerva.edu/">Minerva</a>, the Thiel Fellowship, and a few other efforts, the teaching business is business-as-usual.</p>



<p>Moreover, there’s an important quirk of the college system: Congress and the Department of Education have outsourced the credentialing of colleges and universities to regional accreditation bodies. Harvard, for example, is accredited by “The New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC).” But guess who makes up the regional accreditation bodies? Existing colleges and universities. How excited are existing colleges and universities to allow new competitors? Exactly. The term for this is “cartel.” This point is near top-of-mind because Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz <a href="https://the-ben-marc-show.simplecast.com/episodes/crisis-in-higher-ed-why-universities-still-matter-_cGaVwji">emphasized it on their recent podcast regarding the crises of higher education</a>. If you want a lot more, their podcast is good.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, my notions of what’s important in teaching don’t matter much any more because it’s unlikely I’ll ever teach again, given <a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/09/09/life-swallowing-tasting-and-speaking-after-a-total-glossectomy-meaning-i-have-no-tongue/">that I no longer have a tongue </a>&nbsp;and am consequently difficult to understand. I really liked (and still like!) teaching, but doing it as an adjunct making $3 – $4k / class has been unwise for many years and is even more unwise given how short time is for me right now. Plus, <a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/12/07/tentative-fluttering-optimism-the-surprising-hot-r-d-ferment-in-head-and-neck-cancer-treatment/">the likelihood of me living out the year is not high</a>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of trying to facilitate change and better practices, I also don’t know where, if at all, people teaching writing congregate online. Maybe they don’t congregate anywhere, so it’s hard to try and engage large numbers of instructors.</p>



<p><a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/">Tyler Cowen</a> has a theory, expounded in various podcasts I’ve heard him on, that better teachers are really here to inspire students—which is true regarding both formal and informal education. Part of inspiration is, in my view, being able to rapidly traverse the knowledge space and figure out whatever the learner needs.</p>



<p>Until we perfect neural chips that can download the entirety of human knowledge to the fetal cortex while still in utero, no one springs from the womb knowing everything. In some areas you’ll always be a beginner. Competence, let alone mastery, starts with desire and basics.</p>

<hr>

  <p>This blog post provides details about nine vulnerabilities affecting the IPv6 network protocol stack of EDK II, TianoCore's open source reference implementation of UEFI.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this blog post we describe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVyS9JwtFoQ">PixieFAIL</a>, nine vulnerabilities that affect EDK II, the de-facto open source reference implementation of the UEFI specification and possibly all implementations derived from it. The vulnerabilities are present in the network stack of EDK II and can be exploited during the network boot process.</p>
<p>Network boot is a standard feature on enterprise computers and servers. Using network boot to load an OS image from the network at boot time is popular in data centers and high-performance computing (HPC) environments, since server farms and HPC clusters may have hundreds or thousands of compute nodes that need to be provisioned with the same operating system and software configuration, and downloading and running the OS from a central set of servers (Boot servers) could greatly simplify management. In order to provide this network booting feature, UEFI implements a full IP stack at the <a href="https://uefi.org/specs/PI/1.8/V2_Overview.html">DXE phase</a>, opening the door to attacks from the local network during this early stage of the boot process. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment">Preboot Execution Environment</a>(PXE) is the specification for a standardized client-server solution to allow computers to boot over the network, colloquially referred to as <em>netboot</em> or <strong><em>Pixie boot</em></strong>. It was originally introduced by Intel in 1998 and later incorporated into the UEFI specification. Besides IPv4, PXE originally relied on a handful of simple protocols to achieve network booting: DHCP, UDP, and TFTP. These were considered relatively simple protocols that could be implemented with a sufficiently small footprint to fit in Option ROM or Network Interface Card (NIC) firmware. Since the release of version 2.2 of the UEFI specification in 2010, IPv6-based PXE has been part of the UEFI specification as well. In the case of IPv6, besides the core protocol, other protocols such as ICMPv6, Neighbor Discovery (ND), Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD), UDP, TCP, DHCPv6, DNS, and TFTP are implemented, which increased the overall attack surface.</p>
<p>EDK II is an open source implementation of the UEFI specification developed and maintained by <a href="https://www.tianocore.org/">Tianocore</a>, a community of developers from software vendors that also leverage the project for their own UEFI implementations. In a <a href="https://blog.quarkslab.com/for-science-using-an-unimpressive-bug-in-edk-ii-to-do-some-fun-exploitation.html">prior blog post</a> <em>Gwaby</em> explored the attack surface and <em>exploitability of EDK II</em> and showed that even a bug that provides just minimal capability could be used to achieve arbitrary code execution if the context is right. UEFI vulnerabilities that could be triggered remotely seemed like an interesting context for exploitation, and eventually persistence, but where would we look for those?</p>
<p>The EDK II UEFI reference implementation <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/PXE">provides both IPv4- and IPv6-based PXE</a>. In the <a href="https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Spec_2_10_Aug29.pdf">latest available specification (UEFI 2.10)</a> as of this writing, IPv6-based PXE is described in section "<em>24.3.18 - Netboot6</em>".</p>
<p>We performed a cursory inspection of <code>NetworkPkg</code>, Tianocore's EDK II PXE implementation, and identified nine vulnerabilities that can be exploited by unauthenticated remote attackers on the same local network, and in some cases, by attackers on remote networks. The impact of these vulnerabilities includes denial of service, information leakage, remote code execution, DNS cache poisoning, and network session hijacking.</p>

<h2>Technical details</h2>
<h3>Preboot Execution Environment (PXE)</h3>
<p>In order to boot from the network, a client system must be able to locate, download, and execute code that sets up, configures, and runs the operating system. This is usually done in several stages, starting with a minimal program that is downloaded from a network server using a simple protocol, such as TFTP, which then downloads and runs a second booting stage or the full operating system image. </p>
<p>To locate this minimal program, called Network Bootstrap Program (NBP), the PXE client relies on a DHCP server to both obtain the configuration parameters to configure its network interface with a valid IP address and to receive a list of Boot Servers to query for the NBP file. Since the DHCP server must provide such a list and other special parameters, the PXE client has to send some mandatory <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4578">PXE-releated DHCP Options</a>, consequently, the DHCP server must be "PXE enabled", i.e. configured appropriately to recognize PXE client options and to reply with the proper DHCP server options. To facilitate network booting without having to modify the configuration of operational DHCP servers servicing all types of clients, not just PXE clients, the specification splits the regular DHCP server functionality from the PXE-related functionality into two separate services, the DHCP service, and the proxy DHCP service, running on different ports on the same or separate machines. </p>
<p>The PXE client selects a Boot Server and communicates with it using the DHCP protocol to obtain the filename and file service (TFTP) parameters necessary to download the NBP. Finally, the NBP is downloaded, verified (in the case of Secure Boot), and executed. Once the next booting stage or the fully-fledged operating system image is downloaded and setup, execution control is transferred to it. A more detailed description of the PXE boot process is provided <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/PXE">here</a>.</p>
<p>PXE over IPv6 is based on a combination of the DHCPv6 and TFTP protocols, which in turn implies the usage of IPv6 and UDP at layers 3 and 4, respectively. Because a DHCP server may provide a list of Boot Servers by hostname, it is also necessary to have a working implementation of the DNS protocol. </p>
<p>The following picture from the UEFI 2.10 specification summarizes the PXE boot process over IPv6:</p>

<h3>CVE-2023-45229: Integer underflow when processing IA_NA/IA_TA options in a DHCPv6 Advertise message</h3>
<p>When trying to boot using PXE over IPv6, the EDK II firmware starts by sending DHCPv6 <code>Solicit</code> messages. DHCPv6 servers answer with an <code>Advertise</code> message.
<code>Advertise</code> messages are handled in EDK II by the <code>Dhcp6HandleAdvertiseMsg</code> function in <code>NetworkPkg/Dhcp6Dxe/Dhcp6Io.c</code>, which calls <code>Dhcp6SeekStsOption</code> in order to search for <code>Status</code> codes in the received message. A <code>Status</code> code may appear as an option in the DHCPv6 message, or as an option inside another option, such as the <code>IA_NA</code> or <code>IA_TA</code> options.</p>
<p>When seeking for <code>Status</code> codes encapsulated in <code>IA_NA</code> or <code>IA_TA</code> options, the vulnerable function <code>Dhcp6SeekStsOption</code> in <code>NetworkPkg/Dhcp6Dxe/Dhcp6Io.c</code> does the following:</p>

<span>[...]</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Basically, the <code>IA_NA</code> and <code>IA_TA</code> options in an <code>Advertise</code> message are trusted without doing basic sanity checks, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in the case of <code>IA_NA</code> options:</p>
<ul>
<li>that the option is at least 16 bytes in length before setting <code>IaInnerOpt</code> to <code>*Option + 16</code>, at [1].</li>
<li>that the value of the <code>optlen</code> field of the option is at least 12, before subtracting 12 from it, at [2].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the case of <code>IA_TA</code> options:</p>
<ul>
<li>that the option is at least 8 bytes in length before setting <code>IaInnerOpt</code> to <code>*Option + 8</code>, at [3].</li>
<li>that the value of the <code>optlen</code> field of the option is at least 4, before subtracting 4 from it, at [4].</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The lack of checking for sane values in the <code>optlen</code> field of these options allows to trigger an integer underflow, by setting the <code>optlen</code> field to a value &lt; 12 (in the case of <code>IA_NA</code>) or &lt; 4 (in the case of <code>IA_TA</code>).</p>
<p>As an example, if we send a DHCPv6 <code>Advertise</code> message containing an <code>IA_NA</code> option with its <code>optlen</code> field set to 11, when the code above calls <code>Dhcp6SeekOption</code> at [5] to scan forward for status options, the <code>IaInnerLen</code> parameter will be set to 0xFFFF (11 - 12), and as a result function <code>Dhcp6SeekOption</code> will attempt to read memory well past the end of the received packet.</p>
<h3>CVE-2023-45230: Buffer overflow in the DHCPv6 client via a long Server ID option</h3>
<p>After doing the initial <code>Solicit</code>/<code>Advertise</code> exchange, a DHCPv6 client needs to send a <code>Request</code> message. This is done via the <code>Dhcp6SendRequestMsg</code> function in <code>NetworkPkg/Dhcp6Dxe/Dhcp6Io.c</code>.</p>
<p>This <code>Request</code> message needs to keep a few DHCPv6 options sent during the <code>Solicit</code> message, such as <code>OPTION_ORO</code> (0x6), <code>OPTION_CLIENT_ARCH_TYPE</code> (0x3D), <code>OPTION_NII</code> (0x3E), and <code>OPTION_VENDOR_CLASS</code> (0x10). These options are kept in <code>Instance-&gt;Config-&gt;OptionList</code>. Their lengths are added up ([1]), in order to calculate the size of the buffer needed to store the <code>Request</code> packet. Notice that the total size of the allocation is <code>DHCP6_BASE_PACKET_SIZE</code> (1024, defined in <code>NetworkPkg/Dhcp6Dxe/Dhcp6Impl.h</code>) plus the sum of the lengths of the options mentioned before ([2]). In our tests <code>UserLen</code> typically ends up having the value 67, so the total size of the allocation is 1091 bytes.</p>

<p>The <code>Request</code> message also needs to retain the <em>Server ID</em> (0x2) option that was previously sent by the DHCPv6 server in the <code>Advertise</code> message. It is retrieved this way:</p>

<p>Then, the <code>Request</code> packet is built by assembling all the needed options, one after the other: first the Client ID, then the Elapsed Time, then the Server ID, and so on.
Notice that when appending the Server ID option (which is fully controlled by the DHCPv6 server), its <code>Length</code> field is fully trusted, without any sanity checks. Therefore, a Server ID option with an overly large <code>Length</code> field can overflow the <code>Packet-&gt;Dhcp6.Option</code> buffer with fully controlled data (overflow data comes from the <code>DUID</code> field of the Server ID option).</p>

<p>If the options section of an incoming ND <code>Redirect</code> message is made of one single option, which is truncated and composed of only the Option Code (i.e. 1 single byte), <code>Ip6IsNDOptionValid</code> returns TRUE. This happens because <code>Ip6IsNDOptionValid</code> is called with parameter <code>OptionLen</code> == 1, and <code>sizeof(IP6_OPTION_HEADER)</code> is 2, therefore the <code>while</code> loop in charge of traversing the list of options ([1]) is never entered, and we just reach the <code>return TRUE</code> at the end ([2]), meaning that the truncated option is considered as valid, even though it is not.</p>

<p>The function <code>Ip6IsOptionValid</code> handles different option types. If it's not one of <code>Pad1</code>, <code>PadN</code>, or <code>RouterAlert</code>, the switch case falls into the <code>default</code> clause at [3]. In that case, the option code is masked with <code>Ip6OptionMask</code> (0xC0) at [4], and if the result of the AND operation is <code>Ip6OptionSkip</code> (0x00), then the <code>Offset</code> variable is updated by adding the value of the <code>Length</code> field of the option at [5]. Notice that it doesn't check if the <code>Length</code> field of the option is 0, in which case the <code>Offset</code> value is never modified, and thus an infinite loop ensues, since execution can never break out of the <code>while</code> loop at [2].</p>

The function <code>Ip6IsOptionValid</code> handles different option types. One of those supported types is <code>PadN</code> ([2]).

If the <code>Length</code> field of the option is 0xFE, then 0x100 (0xFE + 2) will be added to <code>Offset</code>. But the result of that addition is truncated to a <code>UINT8</code> (the type of the <code>Offset</code> variable), which means that when adding 0x100 to <code>Offset</code> it will remain unmodified, and thus an infinite loop ensues, since execution can never break out of the <code>while</code> loop at [1].</p>

<h3>CVE-2023-45234: Buffer overflow when processing DNS Servers option in a DHCPv6 Advertise message</h3>
<p>The function <code>PxeBcHandleDhcp6Offer</code> in <code>NetworkPkg/UefiPxeBcDxe/PxeBcDhcp6.c</code> handles DHCPv6 offers made by DHCPv6 servers in response to EDK II <code>Solicit</code> messages.
The function allocates a pool buffer with the size given by the <code>OPTION_DNS_SERVERS</code> (0x17) option length at [1], which is controlled by the DHCPv6 server, then at [2] it calls <code>CopyMem</code> with a fixed size: <code>sizeof (EFI_IPv6_ADDRESS)</code>, which is 0x10. This means that if the length of the <code>OPTION_DNS_SERVERS</code> option included in the server response is shorter than 0x10, then that leads to a buffer overflow.</p>

<p>If the DHCPv6 offer it has received is a proxy one ([2]), then the function searches for the <em>Server ID</em> option contained within said DHCPv6 offer ([3]), and proceeds to copy it to <code>Discover-&gt;DhcpOptions</code> (the buffer that was previously allocated in the pool at [1]), blindly trusting the option length as the size of the copy, which is fully controlled by the DHCPv6 server ([4]).</p>
<p>As a result, if the <em>Server ID</em> option of the DHCPv6 proxy offer is longer than 1024 bytes (the size of the <code>DhcpOptions</code> member of the <code>EFI_PXE_BASE_CODE_DHCPV6_PACKET</code> struct), it results in a pool buffer overflow.</p>
<h3>CVE-2023-45236: Predictable TCP Initial Sequence Numbers</h3>
<p>Predictable TCP Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs) are known to be a security issue since 1985 (see <a href="http://nil.lcs.mit.edu/rtm/papers/117.pdf">Morris1985</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/papers/acsac-ipext.pdf">Belovin1989</a>) and a practical attack that exploits it was described in 1995 by Laurent Joncheray (<a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/security95/full_papers/joncheray.pdf">Joncheray1995</a>). A real world instance of an attack that exploited weak TCP ISNs to inject data in a TCP session to compromise a system was disclosed in 1995 (<a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/hh/shimomura-25jan95.txt">Shimomura1995</a>).</p>
<p>Given these and other findings, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1948">RFC1948</a> proposed an algorithm to generate TCP ISNs in a way that prevents the described attack. In 2012 <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6528">RFC6528</a> officially updated the TCP protocol specification and the new TCP ISN algorithm achieved the status of Proposed Standard. In August 2022, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9293">RFC 9293</a> a revision of the core TCP specification was published as the new Internet Standard, and the aforementioned algorithm was recommended for the generation of TCP ISNs.</p>
<p>The TCP implementation in Tianocore's EDK II IP stack generates trivially predictable TCP Initial Sequence Numbers and it is therefore vulnerable to TCP session hijack attacks.</p>
<p>The ISN for a new TCP instance is populated in <code>TcpInitTcbLocal</code> by calling <code>TcpGetIss()</code> as shown below

<p>Therefore Tianocore's EDK II TCP implementation generates ISNs using fixed increments from a fixed base value and thus is susceptible to TCP session injection and session hijack attacks.</p>
<h3>CVE-2023-45237: Use of a Weak PseudoRandom Number Generator</h3>
<p>The EDK II IP stack uses a pseudorandom number generator which is defined in <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/NetworkPkg/Include/Library/NetLib.h#L542"><code>Network/Include/Library/NetLIb.h</code></a> as:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Throughout the NetworkPkg stack the above macro is used with <code>Seed</code> usually taking the value from the <code>NetRandomInitSeed()</code> function defined in <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/NetworkPkg/Library/DxeNetLib/DxeNetLib.c#L898">NetworkPkg/Library/DxeNetLib/DxeNetLib.c</a> as follows:</p>

<p>The above function outputs an integer value based on the platform's clock time at which the function is called and the platform's monotonic counter. The C language idiom <code>NET_RANDOM (NetRandomInitSeed()</code> is used in several <code>NetworkPkg</code> functions to generate supposedly random unique numeric identifiers for various network protocol fields. Generating numbers in such a way does not produce random numbers with a uniform distribution, instead, it produces easily predictable numbers and a biased distribution. Furthermore, the use of the same idiom in different network layers to assign allegedly random values to protocols' fields or objects makes it possible for an external observer to recover the internal state of the generator by obtaining samples of the numbers used in any such network layer.</p>

<p>The same idiom is used to initialize the fragment ID for IPv6 fragmentation Extension Headers, to generate DHCP transaction IDs on both Dhcp4 and Dhcp6 code, to obtain ephemeral port numbers for UDP and TCP, and in other parts of the stack.</p>
<p>The security and privacy vulnerabilities arising from the use of a weak pseudorandom number generator in various Internet Protocols are described in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9414/">RFC 9414</a> and a number of algorithms to address those issues are suggested in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9414/">RFC 9415</a>. In this particular case, the use of a weak PRNG could facilitate DNS and DHCP poisoning attacks, information leakage, denial of service, and data insertion attacks at the IPv4 and IPv6 layer (due also to the use of a per datagram unit increment of the corresponding ID fields).</p>
<p>At the root of this issue is the use of a <em>Linear Congruential Generator</em> to generate a sequence of pseudorandom <em>security-sensitive</em> numbers. The unsuitability of LCGs for security-sensitive purposes (where the numbers generated should not be guessable) has been known for decades, for example in <a href="https://www.enseignement.polytechnique.fr/profs/informatique/Francois.Morain/Master1/Crypto/projects/Stern87.pdf">Stern 1987</a>.</p>
<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>We would like to thank our colleagues at Quarkslab for providing feedback and reviewing and editing this blog post.
We would also like to thank Vijay Sarvepalli of CERT/CC, the team members of CERT-FR, and all the PSIRT and product security coordinators from the multiple vendors that participated in the disclosure process.</p>
<h3>Disclosure timeline</h3>
<p>Below we include a timeline of all the relevant events during the coordinated vulnerability disclosure process with the intent of providing transparency to the whole process and our actions. The timeline also serves as a detailed example of the complexity of reporting vulnerabilities and coordinating the development and release of security fixes in a complex multi-vendor firmware supply chain.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2023-08-03</strong> Quarkslab sent to CERT/CC a report describing the vulnerabilities and providing proof-of-concept programs to reproduce the first 7 of them. A case was opened in CERT's vulnerability coordination portal. Disclosure deadline is set to November 2nd, 2023.</li>
<li><strong>2023-08-03</strong> <strong>CERT/CC made the report in the vulnerability reporting portal available to vendors and set the target disclosure date to November 2nd, 2023</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>2023-08-04</strong> Quarkslab opened 9 issues in Google's ChromeOS issue tracker because EDK2 is included as a package in the ChromeOS source code tree.</li>
<li><strong>2023-08-05</strong> Google indicated that EDK2 is not used in production Chromebooks and therefore they are not affected by the vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>2023-08-08</strong> Tianocore opened an issue in their issue tracker.</li>
<li><strong>2023-08-08</strong> Insyde Software requested clarifications about the disclosure date. Quarkslab indicated disclosure is set to November 2nd, 2023, 90 days since the initial report.</li>
<li><strong>2023-08-17</strong> Quarkslab posted on the vulnerability coordination portal a request for a status update and asked if the vulnerabilities have been triaged, if any vendors have confirmed being vulnerable, if there were any estimated dates for fixes, if CVEs have been assigned, and indicated that it did not have access to Tianocore's bug tracking system to see progress on the treatment of the issues.</li>
<li><strong>2023-
08-18</strong> AMI informed that Tianocore's PSIRT lead had retired and explained that once a new one was assigned, a volunteer would pick up the issue. Indicated that November 2nd, 2023 was too optimistic for a deadline and asked if Quarkslab had plans for public disclosure.</li>
<li><strong>2023-08-18</strong> Quarkslab replied that disclosure was potentially planned in talk at an upcoming security conference and that in any case, results of the associated research project had to be published in 2023.</li>
<li><strong>2023-08-18</strong> AMI informed that Tianocore was considering acknowledging vulnerability finders in their public advisories and that to improve responsiveness anyone could contribute fixes.</li>
<li><strong>2023-08-20</strong> Quarkslab encouraged Tianocore's adoption of the policy of acknowledging bug finders as other vendors do and asked if it was suggested that to improve responsiveness Quarkslab should contribute the fixes. Indicated that the suggestion would be considered but since vendors in the Tianocore consortium had 100x to 1000x more engineering capacity and based their commercial UEFI implementations on EDK2, it would be more reasonable for them to develop the fixes and not rely on external contributors.</li>
<li><strong>2023-08-28</strong> AMI wrote that often researchers are well positioned to implement fixes, informed that it opened 9 issues in Tianocore bug tracker to follow each vulnerability individually, and asked if Quarkslab felt it could remediate any.  </li>
<li><strong>2023-08-28</strong> Quarkslab replied that the maintainers and developers of EDK2 would be in the best position to develop and test fixes, as they are already familiar with the code and do not have to incur in any setup cost to do it. Quarkslab would rather like that the organizations supporting Tianocore dedicated their vast resources to implement fixes in a timely manner. In Quarkslab's opinion, fixes for vulnerabilities 1 to 7 should be easy to produce quickly, while vulnerabilities 8 and 9 would take more time as they require implementation and use of a new PRNG (possibly using building blocks that already exist in EDK2) in the PXE stack. However, given that these issues have been known and documented for over a quarter of a century, they should be considered public knowledge in any open source network stack.</li>
<li><strong>2023-09-06</strong> Insyde Software asked Quarkslab if the publication date could be postponed by 30 days, as the issues had to be addressed by 4 sets of PSIRT teams (Tianocore, IFVs, ODMs, OEMs). </li>
<li><strong>2023-09-06</strong> Quarkslab agreed to re-schedule disclosure to December 1st, 2023 and said that so far only Insyde Software indicated it was affected and addressing the vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>2023-09-09</strong> Phoenix Technologies indicated that several members of Tianocore's open-source community were working on patches, and the first 7 vulnerabilities would have patches shortly and the other two would take a bit longer. CVEs would be assigned soon. </li>
<li><strong>2023-09-10</strong> Phoenix Technologies shared the CVEs assigned by Tianocore.</li>
<li><strong>2023-09-11</strong> A Tianocore core developer indicated that he was working on making fixes unit-testable.</li>
<li><strong>2023-09-14</strong> <strong>CERT/CC updated the target disclosure date to December 1st, 2023</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>2023-10-06</strong> AMI indicated that non-validated patches were available on Tianocore's bug tracker.</li>
<li><strong>2023-10-12</strong> Google indicated that it removed the unused EDK2 package from their source code repos. The 9 issues were closed.</li>
<li><strong>2023-10-23</strong> Microsoft asked if it was possible to postpose the Dec. 1, 2023 disclosure date as they would need more time to deploy a complete fix on their cloud infrastructure and depended on some partners for it. Also asked if Quarkslab was to publish the details in a blog post.</li>
<li><strong>2023-10-23</strong> Quarkslab agreed to reschedule disclosure to December 7th, 2023 but reminded that, as stated in August, needed to publish the research work within 2023. It also indicated that since vendors were already progressing towards releasing fixes, it did not think reasonable to delay disclosure much longer, and confirmed that details about the vulnerabilities would be published in a blog post.</li>
<li><strong>2023-10-25</strong> Microsoft said that postponing disclosure one week was immaterial as it would not allow sufficient time to roll out comprehensive fixes to customers. Asked for the specific technical content of the blog post to be published, expressing concerns that exploit code would be included and asked if it was possible not to do so. Indicated that they had confirmed with Tianocore that patches were not finalized yet and were unlikely to be available before the December disclosure date and that they disagreed with Quarkslab's assumption that "vendors were progressing towards releasing fixes". Microsoft asked to hold off disclosure until May 2024.</li>
<li><strong>2023-10-25</strong> A Tianocore core developer requested more time to get products patched and clarified that there were no validated patches on the open source side yet, a first draft had been submitted for review and the expectation was they'd become available in November to Tianocore's infosec community. Patches would then have to be integrated, tested and deployed to customer devices which usually takes months. The core developer referenced a <a href="https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/What%20is%20UEFI-Aug31-2023-Final.pdf">UEFI Forum paper</a> which describes the complex supply chain challenges of the UEFI ecosystem, and indicated that "any public announcement before middle of 2024 would cause significant negative impact."</li>
<li><strong>2023-10-25</strong> Phoenix Technologies expressed strong support for Tianocore's and Microsoft's position and indicated that the ongoing case was mentioned in a podcast (without providing any technical details) to exemplify the difficulties of producing patches and why embargo lengths must be flexible. </li>
<li><strong>2023-10-27</strong> CERT/CC asked Tianocore and vendors to continue working with supply-chain channels and partners towards the disclosure date as it may be difficult for Quarkslab to postpone it since it was also working with other stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>2023-11-01</strong> A Tianocore core developer indicated that some patches were being unit tested and submitted for validation.</li>
<li><strong>2023-11-07</strong> AMI told Quarkslab that Tianocore considered CVE-2023-45236 and CVE-2023-45237 weaknesses rather than vulnerabilities primarily due to lack of "proven, computationally feasible exploitability" and asked to provide a PoC if it existed.</li>
<li><strong>2023-11-08</strong> Dell asked for confirmation that Quarkslab planned to  disclose the vulnerabilities in a blog post.</li>
<li><strong>2023-11-11</strong> Microsoft asked Quarkslab to share a technical draft of the contents that would be published in the blog, reiterated its concerns that it would contain explicit details regarding exploit code and asked for the exploit code not to be added.</li>
<li><strong>2023-11-13</strong> Dell agreed with Microsoft's position that delaying disclosure one week did not make a difference, and said that a later disclosure (May 2024) would be more suitable. </li>
<li><strong>2023-11-13</strong> A Tianocore core developer indicated that patches for the vulnerabilities 1 to 7 were available in a private Pull Request on Tianocore's GitHub repository.</li>
<li><strong>2023-11-13</strong> Microsoft stated that 4 vendors had expressed concerns about the December 12th, 2023 disclosure date and asked CERT/CC to relay their message to Quarkslab.</li>
<li><strong>2023-11-14</strong> Quarkslab responded to AMI's message communicating Tianocore's assessment of <strong>CVE-2023-45236</strong> and <strong>CVE-2023-45237</strong> as weaknesses rather than vulnerabilities. Quarkslab expressed disagreement with such an assessment stating that <strong>CVE-2023-45236</strong> (TCP ISNs with the same algorithm as EDK2) had been <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/hh/shimomura-25jan95.txt">exploited in the wild</a> in 1995 and merited a <a href="https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/documents/502/1995_019_001_496168.pdf">security advisory published by CERT</a>, mitigations were proposed in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1948">RFC 1948</a> in 1996, Microsoft considered it a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/1999/ms99-046"><strong>Critical</strong> vulnerability</a> in 1999, motivated another <a href="https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=96665752">CERT Advisory</a> in 2001 and was <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2011-3188">fixed again in the Linux kernel</a> in 2011. Over almost 3 decades every major operating system vendor considered it a vulnerability and fixed it as such and therefore Quarkslab did not believe producing an actual exploit was necessary to prove "computationally feasible exploitability". 
With regards to <strong>CVE-2023-45237</strong> (Use of weak PRNG to generate numeric IDs in the network stack) the same long history of vulnerability disclosures and fixes could be pointed out in several components that suffered from the problem, the most known being predictable DNS query IDs, <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/advisories/sni_12_resolverid.txt">first reported and fixed in 1997</a> and multiple times afterwards, including the fixes issued in 2008 for almost every DNS resolver and DNS server on the planet (for example in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2008/ms08-020">MS08-20</a>). Quarkslab's vulnerability report pointed at <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9414">RFC 9414</a> which details the long history of problems associated to generation of numeric IDs in network protocols. At the core of these issues is the use of a <em>Linear Congruential Generator</em> to generate a sequence of pseudorandom numbers. EDK2 uses the same LCG as glibc 2.26 (the exact same parameters). The unsuitability of LCGs for security-sensitive purposes (where the numbers generated should not be guessable) have been known for decades, for example in <a href="https://www.enseignement.polytechnique.fr/profs/informatique/Francois.Morain/Master1/Crypto/projects/Stern87.pdf">Stern 1987</a>, therefore Quarkslab did not consider necessary to produce an exploit to prove exploitability.</li>
<li><strong>2023-11-14</strong> Quarkslab replied to the prior requests and commentary from various vendors as follows:<ul>
<li>Stated that the blog post about the issues would contain the technical report submitted to the disclosure coordination forum and a detailed timeline of the relevant events in the disclosure process. It would include proof-of-concept code to trigger vulnerabilities 1 to 7 but NOT exploit code. Reiterated that the purpose of reporting the vulnerabilities was to help vendors identify and fix them, not to debate about the editorial policies for Quarkslab research work. Nonetheless it was willing to discuss that, as well as the quality and lack of technical information in the security advisories and bulletins published by vendors, at an appropriate venue or in a different context.</li>
<li>Indicated that the Quarkslab's statement of October 23rd ("vendors were progressing towards releasing fixes") was based not on opinion but the factual evidence of vendor posts on the vulnerability coordination portal.</li>
<li>Strongly disagreed with the opinion expressed by a vendor that "any public announcement before middle of 2024 would cause significant negative impact" and argued that what had significant negative impact was the risk those vulnerabilities were posing to the uninformed users and organizations that run EDK2-derived firmware implementations with the vulnerable NetworkPkg component, and that informing them of their exposure and giving them the necessary information to either fix the vulnerabilities (ideally with official patches), to mitigate them, or to be able to detect active attacks was actually the opposite of having "significant negative impact".</li>
<li>Indicated that 3 months after the initial report date not a single vendor had committed to an estimated release date for fixes. The original 90-day embargo period was extended to 120 days upon request from a vendor (Insyde Software) and at the time (2 months prior) no vendor objected the new deadline. Yet only 2 weeks ago one vendor proposed to postpone the disclosure deadline for 6 months with no actual concrete release date or timeline for fixes.</li>
<li>Commented that the referenced UEFI Forum paper provides a good description of the complexity of the UEFI firmware supply chain but it argued for a 300-day embargo period by presenting an exceptional case as if it was the general one, and assuming that the existing series of interlocked, extremely waterfall-oriented, software development lifecycles of all stakeholders should explain the need of such period. Quarkslab noted that in August 2023 the US Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/call-action-bolster-uefi-cybersecurity-now">A Call to Action: Bolster UEFI Cybersecurity Now</a> calling for UEFI vulnerability response, including timely and effective update mechanisms.</li>
<li>Summarized its position with the following: Quarkslab was being asked to extend the embargo period from 120 days (which had already been extended from the original 90) to about 10 months counting from initial report date, without any firm commitment from any vendor to an actual release date and an opaque timeline. Delaying disclosure implies keeping Quarkslab's partners and customers at risk and in the dark about the vulnerabilities, which in turn put the company in a very uncomfortable position where malicious activities or cyberattacks could happen during that extended time frame. Because of the above, a priori was not inclined to extend our embargo period but since Quarkslab is a company incorporated in France, it decided to consult with CERT-FR (the national CERT of France operated by ANSSI, the French cybersecurity agency) to determine how to proceed. Precise status updates and firm commitment to a release date from affected vendors would be useful to inform any decision.</li>
