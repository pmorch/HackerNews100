<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">For more than two months, the Trump administration has been subject to a federal court order stopping it from cutting funding related to gender identity and the provision of gender-affirming care in response to President Donald Trump’s executive orders.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">Lawyers for the federal government have repeatedly claimed in court filings that the administration has been complying with the order.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">But new whistleblower records submitted in a lawsuit led by the Washington state attorney general appear to contradict the claim.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">Nearly two weeks after the court’s preliminary injunction was issued, the National Institutes of Health’s then-acting head, Dr. Matthew J. Memoli, drafted a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25928836-wa-case_memoli/">memo that details</a> how the agency, in response to Trump’s executive orders, cut funding for research grants that “promote or inculcate gender ideology.” An internal spreadsheet of terminated NIH grants also references “gender ideology” and lists the number associated with Trump’s executive order as the reason for the termination of more than a half dozen research grants.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">The Washington attorney general’s allegation that the Trump administration violated a court order comes as the country lurches toward a constitutional crisis amid accusations that the executive branch has defied or ignored court orders in several other cases. In the most high-profile case so far, the administration has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/nx-s1-5358421/supreme-court-abrego-garcia-deportation-decision">yet to comply with a federal judge’s order</a>, upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court, requiring it to “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">The records filed in the NIH-related lawsuit last week also reveal for the first time the enormous scope of the administration’s changes to the agency, which has been subject to massive layoffs and research cuts to align it with the president’s political priorities.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">Other documents filed in the case raise questions concerning a key claim the administration has made about how it is restructuring federal agencies — that the Department of Government Efficiency has <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/on-doge--directives--and-doj">limited authority</a>, acting mostly as an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-cost-efficiency-initiative/">advisory body that consults</a> on what to cut. However, in depositions filed in the case last week, two NIH officials testified that DOGE itself gave directions in hundreds of grant terminations.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">The lawsuit offers an unprecedented view into the termination of more than 600 grants at the NIH over the past two months. Many of the canceled grants appear to have focused on subjects that the administration claims are unscientific or that the agency should no longer focus on under new priorities, such as gender identity, vaccine hesitancy and diversity, equity and inclusion. Grants related to <a href="https://x.com/DOGE/status/1895645518912795109?lang=en">research in China</a> have also been cut, and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/nih-funding-climate-change-public-health">climate change</a> projects are under scrutiny.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">Andrew G. Nixon, the director of communications for the Department of Health and Human Services, the NIH’s parent agency, told ProPublica in an email that the grant terminations directly followed the president’s executive orders and that the NIH’s actions were based on policy and scientific priorities, not political interference.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">“The cuts are essential to refocus NIH on key public health priorities, like the chronic disease epidemic,” he said. Nixon also told ProPublica that its questions related to the lawsuit “solely fit a partisan narrative”; he did not respond to specific questions about the preliminary injunction, the administration’s compliance with the order or the involvement of DOGE in the grant termination process. The White House did not respond to ProPublica’s questions.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Mike Faulk, the deputy communications director for the Washington state attorney general’s office, told ProPublica in an email that the administration “appears to have used DOGE in this instance to keep career NIH officials in the dark about what was happening and why.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">“While claiming to be transparent, DOGE has actively hidden its activities and its true motivations,” he said. “Our office will use every tool we have to uncover the truth about why these grants were terminated.”</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">Since Trump took office in January, the administration has provided limited insight into why it  chose to terminate scientific and medical grants. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.1">That decision-making process has been largely opaque, until now.</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Washington Fights to Overturn Grant Termination</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">In February, Washington state — joined by Minnesota, Oregon, Colorado and three physicians —&nbsp;sued the administration after it threatened to enforce its executive orders by withholding federal research grants from institutions that provided gender-affirming services or promoted “gender ideology.” Within weeks, a federal judge <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.233.0_5.pdf">issued an injunction</a> limiting the administration from fully enforcing the orders in the four states that are party to the suit.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">The same day as the injunction, however, the NIH terminated a research grant to Seattle Children’s Hospital to develop and study an online education tool designed to reduce the risk of violence, mental health disorders and sexually transmitted infections among transgender youth, according to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.244.0.pdf">records filed in the court case</a>. The NIH stated that it was the agency’s policy not to “prioritize” such studies on gender identity.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">“Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans,” the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.244.1.pdf">notice stated</a>, without citing any scientific evidence for its claims. The NIH sent another notice <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.244.2.pdf">reiterating the termination</a> four days later.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">The Washington attorney general’s office requested the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.245.3_1.pdf">termination be withdrawn</a>, citing the injunction. But the administration <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.243.0.pdf">refused</a>, claiming that it was in compliance as the termination was based on NIH’s own authority and grant policy and was not enforcing any executive order.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">The Washington attorney general asked the judge to hold the administration in contempt for violating the injunction. While the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.258.0_3.pdf">request was denied</a>, the court granted an expedited discovery process to better assess whether the administration had breached the injunction. That process would have required the administration to quickly turn over internal documents relating to the termination. In response, the administration <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.267.0_1.pdf">reinstated the grant</a> for Seattle Children’s Hospital and declared the discovery process moot, or no longer relevant. However, U.S. District Judge Lauren J. King, who was appointed by former President Joseph Biden, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.273.0_2.pdf">permitted</a> it to continue.</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Whistleblower Documents Reveal Sweeping Changes at NIH</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">In recent months, whistleblowers have <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.275.0.pdf">made the plaintiffs in the lawsuit aware</a> of internal records that more closely connect the grant terminations to the administration’s executive orders.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">In an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.276.4.pdf">internal spreadsheet</a> of dozens of grants marked for cancellation at an NIH institute, the stated reason for termination for several was “gender ideology (EA 14168),” including the grant to Seattle Children’s Hospital.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">The rationale appears to reference Executive Order 14168, which <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/30/2025-02090/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal">banned using federal funds</a> to “promote gender ideology,” again seeming to conflict with the administration’s stance that the termination was not based on the executive orders. The termination dates of the grants, according to the spreadsheet, were after the injunction went into effect.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">Another internal document, which provides extraordinary insight into the administration’s efforts to reshape the NIH, also states the executive order was the impetus for grant terminations.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">In the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.276.5.pdf">March 11 memo from Memoli</a>, the NIH cataloged all actions that the agency had taken thus far to align with the president’s executive orders. In a section detailing the steps taken to implement the “gender ideology” executive order, one of the 44 actions listed was the termination of active grants.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">“NIH is currently reviewing all active grants and supplements to determine if they promote gender ideology and will take action as appropriate,” the memo stated, noting that the process was in progress.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0">While the administration has said in court filings that it is following the judge’s injunction order, the Washington state attorney general’s office told ProPublica that it disagreed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">“Their claim to have complied with the preliminary injunction is almost laughable,” said Faulk, the office’s deputy communications director. “The Trump administration is playing games with no apparent respect for the rule of law.”</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Depositions Reveal DOGE Links</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0">In depositions conducted last month as part of the lawsuit, the testimony of two NIH officials also raised questions about why the research grants were terminated and how DOGE was involved.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">Liza Bundesen, who was the deputy director of the agency’s extramural research office, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25919695-liza-bundesen-depo/">testified</a> that she first learned of the grant terminations on Feb. 28 from a DOGE team member, Rachel Riley. Bundesen said she was invited into a Microsoft Teams video call, where Riley introduced herself as being <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/elon-musk-doge-tracker/">part of DOGE</a> and working with the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0">Riley, a former consultant for McKinsey &amp; Co., joined HHS on Jan. 27, according to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277150/gov.uscourts.dcd.277150.80.5.pdf">court filings in a separate lawsuit</a>, and has <a href="https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/03/nih-faces-renewed-doge-directive-cut-staff-pre-covid-levels-putting-thousands-line-rifs/403593/">reportedly served</a> as the DOGE point person at the NIH.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-cost-efficiency-initiative/">executive order</a> detailing DOGE’s responsibilities describes the cost-cutting team as advisers that consult agency heads on the termination of contracts and grants. No language in the orders gives the DOGE team members the <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/on-doge--directives--and-doj">authority to direct the cancellation</a> of grants or contracts. However, the depositions portray Riley as giving directions on how to conduct the terminations.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">“She informed me that a number of grants will need to be terminated,” Bundesen testified, adding that she was told that they needed to be terminated by the end of the day. “I did not ask what, you know, what grants because I just literally was a little bit confused and caught off guard.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">Bundesen said she then received an email from Memoli, the NIH acting director, with a spreadsheet listing the grants that needed to be canceled and a template letter for notifying researchers of the terminations.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">“The template had boilerplate language that could then be modified for the different circumstances, the different buckets of grants that were to be terminated,” she said. “The categories were DEI, research in China and transgender or gender ideology.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">Bundesen forwarded the email with the spreadsheet to Michelle Bulls, who directs the agency’s Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration. Bundesen resigned from the NIH a week later, on March 7, citing “untenable” working conditions.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">“I was given directives to implement with very short turnaround times, often close of business or maybe within the next hour,” she testified. “I was not offered the opportunity to provide feedback or really ask for clarification.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">Bulls confirmed in her own deposition that the termination list and letter template originally came from Riley. When Bulls started receiving the lists, she said she did what she was told. “I just followed the directive,” she said. “The language in the letters were provided so I didn’t question.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0">Bulls said she didn’t write any of the letters herself and just signed her name to them. She also said she was not aware whether anyone had assessed the grants’ scientific merit or whether they met agency criteria. The grant terminations related to gender identity did not stem from an independent agency policy, she testified, appearing to contradict the administration’s assertion that they were based on the agency’s <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.245.3_1.pdf">own authority and grant policy</a>.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">As of April 3, Bulls said she had received more than five lists of grants that needed to be terminated, amounting to “somewhere between five hundred and a thousand” grants.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">Most grant recipients endure a rigorous vetting process, which can <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy-and-compliance/policy-topics/peer-review/simplifying-review/background">involve multiple stages of peer review</a> before approval, and before this year, Bulls testified that grant terminations at the NIH have historically been rare. There are generally two main types of terminations, she said, for noncompliance or based on mutual agreement. Bulls said that she has been “generally involved in noncompliance discussions” and since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150220033625/https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2012/11/29/oer-welcomes-michelle-bulls/">she became the director</a> of the office in 2012, there had been fewer than five such terminations.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">In addition to the termination letters, Bulls said she relied on the template language provided by Riley to draft guidance to inform the 27 centers and institutes at the NIH what the agency’s new priorities were to help them scrutinize their own research portfolios.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">Following the depositions, the Washington state attorney general’s office said that the federal government has refused to respond to its discovery requests. It has filed a motion to compel the government to respond, which is pending.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">Riley, Bundesen, Bulls and Memoli did not reply to ProPublica’s requests for comment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">While the administration did not answer ProPublica’s questions about DOGE and its involvement in the grant terminations, last week in its <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf">budget blueprint</a>, it generally justified its proposed cuts at the NIH with claims that the agency had “wasteful spending,” conducted “risky research” and promoted “dangerous ideologies that undermine public health.”</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">“NIH has grown too big and unfocused,” the White House claimed in its fiscal plan, adding that the agency’s research should “align with the President’s priorities to address chronic disease and other epidemics, implementing all executive orders and eliminating research on climate change, radical gender ideology, and divisive racialism.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0">Jeremy Berg, who led the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the NIH from 2003 to 2011, told ProPublica that the administration’s assessment of the institution was “not fair and not based on any substantial analysis or evidence,” and the proposed cuts “would be absolutely devastating to NIH and to biomedical research in the United States.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0">“It is profoundly distressing to see this great institution being reduced to a lawless, politicized organization without much focus on its actual mission,” he said.</p>

While Google has set 2030 goals to reach net zero emissions across its operations and value chain, and to reduce 50% of its combined Scope 1, 2, and 3 absolute emissions, on a 2019 basis,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/google-asks-large-suppliers-to-commit-to-100-renewable-energy-as-emissions-continue-to-rise/">the company recently reported</a>&nbsp;that its emissions increased by 13% in 2023, and are up by 48% since 2019, as its growing data center electricity consumption has outpaced its ability to bring carbon free energy projects online. Google has also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/google-achieves-zero-lifetime-net-carbon-footprint-now-aiming-for-100-carbon-free-energy/">set a goal</a>&nbsp;in 2020 to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) by 2030, matching electricity demand with CFE supply every hour of every day, in every region where the company operates.</p> <p>Last year, <a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/google-signs-first-nuclear-energy-deal-to-address-growing-ai-carbon-footprint/">Google signed its first advanced nuclear agreement</a> with nuclear technology company Kairos Power aimed at deploying a fleet of small advanced nuclear power projects across the U.S. to provide up to 500 MW of carbon-free energy.goals.</p> <p>As part of the new agreement with Elementl, Google will commit early-stage development capital to advance the development of three projects, each of which will be able to generate at least 600 MW of power capacity.</p> <p>Amanda Peterson Corio, Global Head of Data Center Energy at Google, said:</p> <blockquote><p>“Google is committed to catalyzing projects that strengthen the power grids where we operate, and advanced nuclear technology provides reliable, baseload, 24/7 energy. Our collaboration with Elementl Power enhances our ability to move at the speed required to meet this moment of AI and American innovation.”</p></blockquote> <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/amazon-google-and-meta-join-pledge-to-help-triple-global-nuclear-energy-capacity/">Google and Meta</a> joined a group of major companies pledging to support the goal to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. The pledge notes that “energy demand in many industries is expected to increase significantly in the coming years,” adding that tripling nuclear capacity will “help achieve global goals for enhanced energy resiliency and security, and continuous firm clean energy supply.”</p> <p>Established in 2023, Elementl Power develops, finances, and manages nuclear power projects, using next-generation technology that it claims is the safest form of energy generation.</p> <p>With the support of Google, Elementl said that it is advancing its goal to bring more than 10 gigawatts online in the U.S. by 2035, working collaboratively with regulated utilities, independent power producers and technology suppliers.</p> <p>Elementl Power Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chris Colbert said:</p> <blockquote><p>“Innovative partnerships like this are necessary to mobilize the capital required to build new nuclear projects, which are critical to deliver safe, affordable and clean baseload power and help companies advance their long-term net zero goals. We look forward to working with Google to execute these projects and bring safe, carbon-free, baseload electricity to the grid.”</p></blockquote> <div id="esgto-864566167"><p><a data-no-instant="1" href="https://www.esgtoday.com/esgtoday-events/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" aria-label="1280×250"><img alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" width="900" height="180" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1.jpg 1280w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-300x59.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-1024x200.jpg 1024w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-768x150.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-610x119.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-260x51.jpg 260w" nitro-lazy-src="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1.jpg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="NDkwOjk0OQ==-1" src="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1.jpg" srcset="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1.jpg 1280w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-300x59.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-1024x200.jpg 1024w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-768x150.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-610x119.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-260x51.jpg 260w"></a></p></div></div> </div>  </article>  <div> <p> <img alt="" itemprop="image" height="96" width="96" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/desktop/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d2e27b1c085c926922a9c0c597d43a6c.d53ceb0da52c862b51108768da3086bf6f13e9d9a9009a5ff085191c745b7e83 2x" nitro-lazy-src="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/desktop/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef5655eaf5fddd7fe4013e3e70d592ee.d53ceb0da52c862b51108768da3086bf6f13e9d9a9009a5ff085191c745b7e83" content="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/desktop/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef5655eaf5fddd7fe4013e3e70d592ee.d53ceb0da52c862b51108768da3086bf6f13e9d9a9009a5ff085191c745b7e83" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="NTAzOjM3MQ==-1" src="data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=NTAzOjM3MQ==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgOTYgOTYiIHdpZHRoPSI5NiIgaGVpZ2h0PSI5NiIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj48L3N2Zz4="> </p> <p> <h4> <span> ESG Today Writing Staff </span> </h4> </p> </div>        </main>  </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><blockquote><p><em>Why splitting your codebase too early can quietly destroy your team’s velocity — and what to do instead</em>.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/frame.jpg" alt="microservice vs monolith"></p><p>In a startup, <strong>your survival depends on how quickly you can iterate, ship features, and deliver value to end-users</strong>. This is where the foundational architecture of your startup plays a big role; additionally, things like your tech stack and choice of programming language directly affect your team’s velocity. The wrong architecture, especially premature microservices, can substantially hurt productivity and contribute to missed goals in delivering software.</p><p>I’ve had this experience when working on greenfield projects for early-stage startups, where questionable decisions were made in terms of software architecture that led to half-finished services and <em>brittle, over-engineered and broken local setups</em>, and <strong>demoralized teams</strong> who struggle maintaining unnecessary complexity.</p><p>Before diving into specific pitfalls, here’s what you’re actually signing up for when introducing microservices prematurely:</p><p><strong>Microservices Early On: What You’re Paying For</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Pain Point</th><th>Real-World Manifestation</th><th>Developer Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Deployment Complexity</td><td>Orchestrating 5+ services for a single feature</td><td><strong>Hours lost per release</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Local Dev Fragility</td><td>Docker sprawl, broken scripts, platform-specific hacks</td><td><strong>Slow onboarding, frequent breakage</strong></td></tr><tr><td>CI/CD Duplication</td><td>Multiple pipelines with duplicated logic</td><td><strong>Extra toil per service</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Cross-Service Coupling</td><td>“Decoupled” services tightly linked by shared state</td><td><strong>Slower changes, coordination tax</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Observability Overhead</td><td>Distributed tracing, logging, monitoring</td><td><strong>Weeks to instrument properly</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Test Suite Fragmentation</td><td>Tests scattered across services</td><td><strong>Brittle tests, low confidence</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Let’s unpack why microservices often backfire early on, where they genuinely help, and how to structure your startup’s systems for speed and survival.</p><h2 id="monoliths-are-not-the-enemy">Monoliths Are Not the Enemy</h2><figure><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/monolith.svg" alt="Monolith architecture" width="500"></figure><p>If you’re building some SaaS product, even a simple SQL database wrapper eventually may bring a lot of internal complexity in the way your business logic works; additionally, you can get to various integrations and background tasks that let transform one set of data to another.</p><p>With time, sometimes unnecessary features, it’s inevitable that your app may grow messy. The great thing about monoliths is: they still work. <strong>Monoliths, even when messy, keep your team focused on what matters most</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Staying alive</strong></li><li><strong>Delivering customer value</strong></li></ul><p>The biggest advantage of monoliths is their simplicity in deployment. Generally, such projects are built around existing frameworks — it could be Django for Python, ASP.Net for C#, Nest.js for Node.js apps, etc. When sticking to monolithic architecture, you get the biggest advantage over fancy microservices — a wide support of the open source community and project maintainers who primarily designed those frameworks to work as a single process, monolithic app.</p><p>At one real-estate startup where I led the front-end team, and occasionally consulted the backend team on technology choices, we had an interesting evolution of a Laravel-based app. What started as a small dashboard for real-estate agents to manage deals gradually grew into a much larger system.</p><p>Over time, it evolved into a feature-rich suite that handled hundreds of gigabytes of documents and integrated with dozens of third-party services. Yet, it remained built on a fairly basic PHP stack running on Apache.</p><p>The team leaned heavily on best practices recommended by the Laravel community. That discipline paid off, we were able to scale the application’s capabilities significantly while still meeting the business’s needs and expectations.</p><p>Interestingly, we never needed to decouple the system into microservices or adopt more complex infrastructure patterns. We avoided a lot of accidental complexity that way. The simplicity of the architecture gave us leverage. This echoes what others have written — like Basecamp’s take on the <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/svn3/the-majestic-monolith/">“Majestic Monolith”</a>, which lays out why simplicity is a superpower early on.</p><p>People often point out that it’s hard to make monoliths scalable, but it’s bad modularization <em>inside</em> the monolith that may bring such problems.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: A well-structured monolith keeps your team focused on shipping, not firefighting.</strong></p><h2 id="but-isnt-microservices-best-practice">But Isn’t Microservices “Best Practice”?</h2><p>A lot of engineers reach for microservices early, thinking they’re “the right way.” And sure — at scale, they can help. But in a startup, that same complexity turns into drag.</p><p>Microservices only pay off when you have real scaling bottlenecks, large teams, or independently evolving domains. Before that? You’re paying the price without getting the benefit: duplicated infra, fragile local setups, and slow iteration. For example, <strong>Segment</strong> eventually <a href="https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/">reversed their microservice split</a> for this exact reason — too much cost, not enough value.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: Microservices are a scaling tool — not a starting template.</strong></p><h2 id="where-microservices-go-wrong-especially-early-on">Where Microservices Go Wrong (Especially Early On)</h2><p>In one early-stage team I advised, the decision to split services created more PM-engineering coordination overhead than technical gain. Architecture shaped not just code, but how we planned, estimated, and shipped. That organizational tax is easy to miss — until it’s too late.</p><figure><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/pm-coordination.svg" alt="Coordination between teams" width="600"></figure><p><em><strong>Diagram:</strong> Coordination overhead grows linearly with services — and exponentially when you add product managers, deadlines, and misaligned timelines.</em></p><p>Here are the most common anti-patterns that creep in early.</p><h3 id="1-arbitrary-service-boundaries">1. Arbitrary Service Boundaries</h3><figure><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/premature-microservice.svg" alt="Arbitrary service boundaries in microservices" width="600"></figure><p>In theory, you often see suggestions on splitting your applications by business logic domain — users service, products service, orders service, and so on. This often borrows from Domain-Driven Design or Clean Architecture concepts — which make sense at scale, but in early-stage products, they can ossify structure prematurely, before the product itself is stable or validated. You end up with:</p><ul><li>Shared databases</li><li>Cross-service calls for simple workflows</li><li>Coupling disguised as “separation”</li></ul><p>At one project, I watched a team separating user, authentication, and authorization into separate services, which led to deployment complexity and difficulties in service coordination for any API operation they were building.</p><p>In reality, business logic doesn’t directly map to service boundaries. Premature separation can make the system more fragile and often times difficult to introduce changes quickly.</p><p>Instead, isolate bottlenecks surgically — based on real scaling pain, not theoretical elegance.</p><p>When I’ve coached early-stage teams, we’ve sometimes used internal flags or deployment toggles to simulate future service splits — without the immediate operational burden. This gave product and engineering room to explore boundaries organically, before locking in premature infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: Don’t split by theory — split by actual bottlenecks.</strong></p><h3 id="2-repository-and-infrastructure-sprawl">2. Repository and Infrastructure Sprawl</h3><p>When working on the application, typically a next set of things is important:</p><ul><li>Code style consistency (linting)</li><li>Testing infrastructure, including integration testing</li><li>Local environment configuration</li><li>Documentation</li><li>CI/CD configuration</li></ul><p>When dealing with microservices, you need to multiply those requirements by the number of services. If your project is structured as a monorepo, you can simplify your life by having a central CI/CD configuration (when working with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI). Some teams separate microservices into separate repositories, which makes it way harder to maintain the code consistency and the same set of configurations without extra effort or tools.</p><p><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/tests.svg" alt="tests environments diagram"></p><p>For a three-person team, this is brutal. Context switching across repositories and tooling adds up to the development time of every feature that is shipped.</p><h4 id="mitigating-issues-by-using-monorepos-and-a-single-programming-language">Mitigating issues by using monorepos and a single programming language</h4><p>There are various ways to mitigate this problem. For early projects, the single most important thing is — keeping your code in a monorepo. This ensures that there’s a single version of code that exists on prod, and it’s much easier to coordinate code reviews and collaborate for smaller teams.</p><p>For Node.js projects, I strongly recommend using a monorepo tool like <code>nx</code> or <code>turborepo</code>. Both:</p><ul><li>Simplify CI/CD config across subprojects</li><li>Support dependency graph-based build caching</li><li>Let you treat internal services as TypeScript libraries (via ES6 imports)</li></ul><p>These tools save time otherwise spent writing glue code or reinventing orchestration. That said, they come with real tradeoffs:</p><ul><li>Complex dependency trees can grow fast</li><li>CI performance tuning is non-trivial</li><li>You may need faster tooling (like bun) to keep build times down</li></ul><p>To summarize: Tooling like <code>nx</code> or <code>turborepo</code> gives small teams monorepo velocity — if you’re willing to invest in keeping them clean.</p><p>When developing <code>go</code>-based microservices, a good idea early in the development is to use a single <code>go</code> workspace with the <code>replace</code> directive in <code>go.mod</code>. Eventually, as the software scales, it’s possible to effortlessly separate <code>go</code> modules into separate repositories.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: A monorepo with shared infra buys you time, consistency, and sanity.</strong></p><h3 id="3-broken-local-dev--broken-velocity">3. Broken Local Dev = Broken Velocity</h3><p><strong>If it takes three hours, a custom shell script, and a Docker marathon just to run your app locally, you’ve already lost velocity.</strong></p><p>Early projects often suffer from:</p><ul><li>Missing documentation</li><li>Obsolete dependencies</li><li>OS-specific hacks (hello, Linux-only setups)</li></ul><p>In my experience, when I received projects from past development teams, they were often developed for a single operating system. Some devs preferred building on macOS and never bothered supporting their shell scripts on Windows. In my past teams, I had engineers working on Windows machines, and often it required rewriting shell scripts or fully understanding and reverse engineering the process of getting the local environment running. With time, we standardized environment setup across dev OSes to reduce onboarding friction — a small investment that saved hours per new engineer. It was frustrating — but it taught a lasting lesson on how important it is to get the code running on any laptop your new developer may be using.</p><p>At another project, a solo dev had created a fragile microservice setup, that the workflow of running Docker containers mounted to a local file system. Of course, you pay a little price for running processes as containers when your computer runs Linux.</p><p>But onboarding a new front-end dev with an older Windows laptop turned into a nightmare. They had to spin up ten containers just to view the UI. Everything broke — volumes, networking, container compatibility — and the setup very poorly documented. This created a major friction point during onboarding.</p><p>We ended up hacking together a Node.js proxy that mimicked the nginx/Docker configuration without containers. It wasn’t elegant, but it let the dev get unblocked and start contributing.</p><figure><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/dev-env.svg" alt="complex dev environment in microservices" width="600"></figure><p><strong>Takeaway: If your app only runs on one OS, your team’s productivity is one laptop away from disaster.</strong></p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Ideally, aim for <code>git clone &lt;repo&gt; &amp;&amp; make up</code> to have the project running locally. If it’s not possible, then maintaining an up-to-date README file with instructions for Windows/macOS/Linux is a must. Nowadays, there are some programming languages and toolchains that don’t work well on Windows (like OCaml), but the modern widely popular stack runs just fine on every widely used operating system; by limiting your local setup to a single operating system, it’s often a symptom of under-investment in DX.</p><h3 id="4-technology-mismatch">4. Technology Mismatch</h3><p>Beyond architecture, your tech stack also shapes how painful microservices become — not every language shines in a microservice architecture.</p><ul><li><strong>Node.js and Python:</strong> Great for rapid iteration, but managing build artifacts, dependency versions, and runtime consistency across services gets painful fast.</li><li><strong>Go:</strong> Compiles to static binaries, fast build times, and low operational overhead. More natural fit when splitting is truly needed.</li></ul><p>It’s very important to pick the right technical stack early on. If you look for performance, maybe look for the JVM and its ecosystem and ability to deploy artifacts at scale and run them in microservice-based architectures. If you do very fast iterations and prototype quickly without worrying about scaling your deployment infrastructure — you’re good with something like Python.</p><p>It’s quite often for teams to realise that there are big issues with their choice of technology that wasn’t apparent initially, and they had to pay the price of rebuilding the back-end in a different programming language (like <a href="https://blog.khanacademy.org/go-services-one-goliath-project/?utm_source=blog.quastor.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=khan-academy-s-migration-from-python-to-go">those guys</a> were forced to do something about legacy Python 2 codebase and migrated to Go).</p><p>But on the contrary, if you really need to, you can bridge multiple programming languages with protocols like <strong>gRPC</strong> or async message communication. And it’s often the way to go about things. When you get to the point that you want to enrich your feature set with Machine Learning functionality or ETL-based jobs, you would just separately build your ML-based infrastructure in Python, due to its rich ecosystem of domain-specific libraries, that naturally any other programming language lacks. But such decisions should be made when there’s enough head count to justify this venture; otherwise, the small team will be eternally drawn into the endless complexity of bridging multiple software stacks together.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: Match the tech to your constraints, not your ambition.</strong></p><h3 id="5-hidden-complexity-communication-and-monitoring">5. Hidden Complexity: Communication and Monitoring</h3><p>Microservices introduce an invisible web of needs:</p><ul><li>Service discovery</li><li>API versioning</li><li>Retries, circuit breakers, fallbacks</li><li>Distributed tracing</li><li>Centralized logging and alerting</li></ul><p>In a monolith, a bug might be a simple stack trace. In a distributed system, it’s “why does service A fail when B’s deployment lags C by 30 seconds?”
You would have to thoroughly invest in your observability stack. To do it “properly”, it requires instrumenting your applications in specific ways, e.g. integrating OpenTelemetry to support tracing, or relying on your cloud provider’s tools like AWS XRay if you go with a complex serverless system. But at this point, you have to completely shift your focus from application code towards building complex monitoring infrastructure that to validate whether your architecture is <strong>actually</strong> functioning in production.</p><p>Of course, some of the observability instrumentation is needed to be performed on monolith apps, but it’s way simpler than doing that in terms of the number of services in a consistent way.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Understand that <strong>distributed systems <em>aren’t free.</em></strong> They’re a commitment to a whole new class of engineering challenges.</p><h2 id="when-microservices-do-make-sense">When Microservices <em>Do</em> Make Sense</h2><p>Despite the mentioned difficulties with microservices, there are times where service-level decoupling actually is very beneficial. There are cases where it definitely helps:</p><ul><li><strong>Workload Isolation</strong>: a common example for that would be in AWS best practices on using S3 event notifications — when an image gets loaded to S3, trigger an image resizing/OCR process, etc. Why it is useful: we can decouple obscure data processing libraries in a self-isolated service and make it API focused solely on image processing and generating output from the uploaded data. Your upstream clients that upload data to S3 aren’t coupled with this service, and there’s less overhead in instrumenting such a service because of its relative simplicity.</li><li><strong>Divergent Scalability Needs:</strong> — Imagine you are building an AI product. One part of the system (<strong>web API</strong>) that triggers ML workloads and shows past results isn’t resource intensive, it’s lightweight, because it interacts mostly with the database. On the contrary, ML model runs on GPUs is actually heavy to run and requires special machines with GPU support with additional configuration. By splitting these parts of the application into separate services running on different machines, you can scale them independently.</li><li><strong>Different Runtime Requirements:</strong> — Let’s say you’ve got some legacy part of code written in C++. You have 2 choices — magically convert it to your core programming language or find ways to integrate it with a codebase. Depending on the complexity of that legacy app, you would have to write glue code, implementing additional networking/protocols to establish interactions with that service, but the bottom line is — you will likely have to separate this app as a separate service due to runtime incompatibilities. I would say even more, you could write your main app in C++ as well, but because of different compiler configurations and library dependencies, you wouldn’t be able to easily compile things together as a single binary.</li></ul><p>Large-scale engineering orgs have wrestled with similar challenges. For instance, Uber’s engineering team <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-HR/blog/microservice-architecture/">documented their shift to a domain-oriented microservice architecture</a> — not out of theoretical purity, but in response to real complexity across teams and scaling boundaries. Their post is a good example of how microservices can work when you have the organizational maturity and operational overhead to support them.</p><p>At one project, that also happens to be a real-estate one, we had code from a previous team that runs Python-based analytics workloads that loads data into MS-SQL db, we found that it would be a waste to build on top of it a Django app. The code had different runtime dependencies and was pretty self-isolated, so we kept it separate and only revisited it when something wasn’t working as expected. This worked for us even for a small team, because this analytics generation service was a part that required rare changes or maintenance.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: Use microservices when workloads diverge — not just because they sound clean.</strong></p><h2 id="practical-guidance-for-startups">Practical Guidance for Startups</h2><p>If you’re shipping your first product, here’s the playbook I’d recommend:</p><ul><li><strong>Start monolithic.</strong> Pick a common framework and focus on getting the features done. All known frameworks are more than good enough to build some API or website and serve the users. Don’t follow the hype, stick to the boring way of doing things; you can thank yourself later.</li><li><strong>Single repo.</strong> Don’t bother splitting your code into multiple repositories. I’ve worked with founders who wanted to separate repos to reduce the risk of contractors copying IP — a valid concern. But in practice, it added more friction than security: slower builds, fragmented CI/CD, and poor visibility across teams. The marginal IP protection wasn’t worth the operational drag, especially when proper access controls inside a monorepo were easier to manage. For early-stage teams, clarity and speed tend to matter more than theoretical security gains.</li><li><strong>Dead-simple local setup.</strong> Make <code>make up</code> work. If it takes more, be very specific on the steps, record a video/Loom, and add screenshots. If your code is going to be run by an intern or junior dev, they’ll likely hit a roadblock, and you’ll spend time explaining how to troubleshoot an issue. I found that documenting every possible issue for every operating system eliminates time spent clarifying why certain things in a local setup didn’t work.</li><li><strong>Invest early in CI/CD.</strong> Even if it’s a simple HTML that you could just <code>scp</code> to a server manually, you could automate this and rely on source control with CI/CD to do it. When the setup is properly automated, you just forget about your continuous integration infrastructure and focus on features. I’ve seen many teams and founders when working with outsourced teams often be cheap on CI/CD, and that results in the team being demoralized and annoyed by manual deployment processes.</li><li><strong>Split surgically.</strong> Only split when it clearly solves a painful bottleneck. Otherwise, invest in modularity and tests inside the monolith — it’s faster and easier to maintain.</li></ul><p>And above all: <strong>optimize for developer velocity.</strong></p><p><strong>Velocity is your startup’s oxygen.</strong> Premature microservices leak that oxygen slowly — until one day, you can’t breathe.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: Start simple, stay pragmatic, and split only when you must.</strong></p><h2 id="if-you-go-with-a-microservice-based-approach">If you go with a microservice-based approach</h2><p>I had micro-service-based projects created earlier than they should have been done, and here are the next recommendations that I could give on that:</p><ul><li><strong>Evaluate your technical stack</strong> that powers your micro-service-based architecture. Invest in developer experience tooling. When you have service-based separation, you now need to think about automating your microservice stack, automating config across both local and production environments. In certain projects, I had to build a separate CLI that does administrative tasks on the monorepository. One project I had contained 15-20 microservice deployments, and for the local environment, I had to create a cli-tool for generating docker-compose.yml files dynamically to achieve seamless one-command start-up for the regular developer.</li><li><strong>Focus on reliable communication protocols</strong> around service communication. If it’s async messaging, make sure your message schemas are consistent and standardized. If it’s REST, focus on OpenAPI documentation. Inter-service communication clients must implement many things that don’t come out-of-the-box: retries with exponential backoff, timeouts. A typical bare-bones gRPC client requires you to manually factor those additional things to make sure you don’t suffer from transient errors.</li><li><strong>Ensure that your unit, integration testing, and end-to-end testing setup</strong> is stable and scales with the amount of service-level separations you introduce into your codebase.</li><li>On smaller projects that use micro-service-based workloads, you would likely default to a shared library with common helpers for instrumenting your observability, communication code in a consistent way. An important consideration here — <strong>keep your shared library as small as possible</strong>. Any major change forces a rebuild across all dependent services — even if unrelated.<figure><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/shared-dep.svg" alt="shared library dependency" width="600"></figure></li><li><strong>Look into observability earlier on.</strong> Add structured-JSON logs and create various correlation IDs for debugging things once your app is deployed. Even basic helpers that output rich logging information (until you instrumented your app with proper logging/tracing facilities) often save time figuring out flaky user flows.</li></ul><p>To summarize: if you’re still going for microservices, you should beforehand understand the tax you’re going to pay in terms of additional development time and maintenance to make the setup workable for every engineer in your team.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: If you embrace complexity, invest fully in making it manageable.</strong></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p><strong>Premature microservices are a tax you can’t afford. Stay simple. Stay alive.</strong> Split only when the pain makes it obvious.</p><p><strong>Survive first. Scale later. Choose the simplest system that works — and earn every layer of complexity you add.</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html">Monolith First</a> — Martin Fowler</li><li><a href="https://signalvnoise.com/svn3/the-majestic-monolith">The Majestic Monolith</a> — DHH / Basecamp</li><li><a href="https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices">Goodbye Microservices: From 100s of problem children to 1 superstar</a> — Segment Eng.</li><li><a href="https://shopify.engineering/deconstructing-monolith-designing-software-maximizes-developer-productivity">Deconstructing the Monolith</a> — Shopify Eng.</li><li><a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/microservice-architecture/">Domain‑Oriented Microservice Architecture</a> — Uber Eng.</li><li><a href="https://blog.khanacademy.org/go-services-one-goliath-project/">Go + Services = One Goliath Project</a> — Khan Academy</li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

But it is.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>French <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarmerie"><em>gendarmes</em></a> have been busy policing crypto crimes, but these aren't the usual financial schemes, cons, and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp">HODL!</a> shenanigans one usually reads about. No, these crimes involve abductions, (multiple) severed fingers, and (multiple) people rescued from the trunks of cars—once after being doused with gasoline.</p>
<p>This previous weekend was particularly nuts, with an older gentleman snatched from the streets of Paris' 14th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_of_Paris"><em>arrondissement</em></a> on May 1 by men in ski masks. The 14th is a pleasant place—I highly recommend a visit to the catacombs in Place Denfert-Rochereau—and not usually the site of snatch-and-grab operations. The abducted man was apparently the father of someone who had made a packet in crypto. The kidnappers demanded a multimillion-euro ransom from the man's son.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/05/04/abducted-dad-of-crypto-firm-boss-freed-in-french-police-raid_6740891_7.html%20">Le Monde</a>, the abducted father was taken to a house in a Parisian suburb, where one of the father's fingers was cut off in the course of ransom negotiations. Police feared "other mutilations" if they were unable to find the man, but they did locate and raid the house this weekend, arresting five people in their 20s. (According to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/kidnapped-father-french-crypto-millionaire-150730032.html?guccounter=1">the BBC</a>, French police used "phone signals" to locate the house.)</p>
<p>Sounds crazy, but this was the second such incident this year. In January, crypto maven David Balland was also abducted along with his partner on January 21. Balland was taken to a house, where he also had a finger cut off. According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/04/french-police-investigate-spate-of-cryptocurrency-millionaire-kidnappings">The Guardian</a><em>,</em> "Police were contacted by Balland’s business partner, who received a video of the finger alongside a demand for a large ransom in cryptocurrency, of around €10m. Balland was freed in a police raid soon after. His partner was found tied up in the boot of a car in a carpark in the Essonne area south of Paris the next day."</p>
<p>And a few weeks before that, attackers went to the home of someone whose son was a "crypto-influencer based in Dubai." At the father's home, the kidnappers "tied up [the father's] wife and daughter and forced him into a car. The man’s influencer son received a ransom demand and contacted police. The two women were then quickly freed. The father was only discovered 24 hours later in the boot of a car in Normandy, tied up and showing signs of physical violence, having been sprinkled with petrol."</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/about.html">https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/about.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43921624">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            

<p>Yggdrasil is an experimental compact routing scheme that is <strong>fully decentralised</strong> and only requires a small amount of state to work. It is predominanently a shortest-path scheme, whereby the network will attempt to find the most direct path to the destination.</p>

<p><img src="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/assets/images/about/first.svg"></p>

<p>Nodes are equal participants and connect to each other using <strong>peering connections</strong> which carry network traffic. Peerings can be set up over any IP network — whether that’s a direct wired or wireless link, a local area network or even the Internet. In some cases, peerings can also be set up automatically by nearby devices on the same network using multicast discovery.</p>

<p>All nodes on an Yggdrasil network are routers and will automatically pass traffic to help it get closer to its destination where possible. This means that, even in a network that is only sparsely connected, <strong>all nodes will be reachable</strong> by all other nodes on that network. It doesn’t even matter if a node is behind a NAT — once a peering is established, traffic flows in both directions over that peering.</p>

<p>Yggdrasil is also designed to tolerate changes in the network. For example, if a link fails, the network will self-heal and use other links to route traffic where available. This makes it <strong>suitable for use in mesh networks</strong>, where the network topolopy can and often will change.</p>

<p>Each node on the network has a location-independent <strong>cryptographic identity</strong> and, in our <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/implementation.html">current experimental implementation</a>, stable IPv6 addresses are generated from this key. This allows IPv6-supporting applications to work over Yggdrasil largely without modification. The address is fully mobile and stays with the node as it moves around the network.</p>

<h3 id="why-yggdrasil">Why Yggdrasil?</h3>

<p>Many networks that exist today are hierarchical in nature, require extensive manual configuration and often rely on a certain degree of centralisation in order to scale. This often makes it difficult or impractical to set up networks quickly on an ad-hoc basis and so most people are heavily reliant on their Internet Service Providers (ISPs).</p>

<p>On the other hand, Yggdrasil requires <strong>very little configuration</strong> in order to work and full multi-hop networks can be built up very quickly and easily using Yggdrasil.</p>

<p>Nodes do not need to be assigned an address from a centralised authority; they can <strong>generate their own cryptographic identity</strong> and, more importantly, they can keep this address as they roam. Once peering connections are established, routing information is propagated quickly and automatically throughout the network.</p>

<p>This ability to provide full end-to-end routability between all network nodes means that Yggdrasil is potentially an enabling technology for true edge computing scenarios, as well as real-world mesh networks, as it <strong>does not rely on the Internet</strong> to function.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-yggdrasil-compare-to-other-projects">How does Yggdrasil compare to other projects?</h3>

<p>Yggdrasil is often compared to other projects attempting to create anonymous overlays, such as Tor, I2P, Lokinet and others. These projects are very different to Yggdrasil, in part because they try to guarantee anonymity. Yggdrasil does not aim to provide and <strong>does not guarantee anonymity</strong>. These projects are also intentionally overlay-by-design rather than by convenience, whereas Yggdrasil only exists as an overlay network today because it is an easy way to test the design.</p>

<p>Yggdrasil is frequently compared with VPN projects such as Wireguard, Tailscale, Nebula and Zerotier. Although it is possible to use Yggdrasil to build up private networks and/or point-to-point VPN links, this isn’t explicitly our primary goal. It’s also important to understand that connecting any single node of a private network to another network (such as a public peer) will result in <strong>both networks being bridged together</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, Yggdrasil has <strong>no native exit nodes</strong>, nor does it have any concept of exit nodes, for providing access to the public Internet or to other networks. This can be achieved using proxies or other tunnelling solutions on top of Yggdrasil but this is not something we explicitly aim to provide.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-status-of-the-project">What is the status of the project?</h3>

<p>Yggdrasil is currently an <strong>alpha-level research project</strong>, with on-going development but actively maintained. Our expectation is that a future beta-quality release should know enough to be compatible in the face of wire format changes, and reasonably feature complete. A “stable” 1.0 release, if it ever happens, would probably be feature complete, with no expectation of future wire format changes, and free of known critical bugs.</p>

<p>The true goal of this project is to test the scalability of the Yggdrasil routing scheme and we are doing so with our <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/implementation.html">overlay network implementation</a>. Studying the behaviour of the network in the real world is most easily achieved with a large number of participants running the software and joining the public test network. We’ve done our best to support <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/installation.html">as many platforms as possible</a> and have a number of <a href="https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/public-peers">public peers</a> that you can connect to in order to join the network, so please feel free to experiment.</p>

<p>That said, we <strong>recommend against running any mission-critical workloads</strong> over Yggdrasil and it may be dangerous to rely solely on Yggdrasil for any life-or-death situation. There may be failure modes that we don’t yet know about yet!</p>

<p>The project is likely to reach a number of possible outcomes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The project may reach a reasonably stable state but never attract a large enough number of users</li>
  <li>The project may attract a large enough number of users but reveal inherent design flaws in the process (a learning exercise for a future project or protocol version perhaps)</li>
  <li>The project may end up working perfectly even as the network grows, in which case it will become worthwhile to look at writing better-optimised implementations and/or moving the important parts into other projects</li>
</ol>

												<p>A Texas firm recently charged with conspiring to distribute synthetic opioids in the United States is at the center of a vast network of companies in the U.S. and Pakistan whose employees are accused of using online ads to scam westerners seeking help with trademarks, book writing, mobile app development and logo designs, a new investigation reveals.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/motion_to_seal_eWorldTrade_Azneem_Bilwani_Abtach_drugs_merged_usa_vs_eworldtradellc-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an indictment</a> (PDF) unsealed last month, the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> said Dallas-based <strong>eWorldTrade</strong> “operated an online business-to-business marketplace that facilitated the distribution of synthetic opioids such as isotonitazene and carfentanyl, both significantly more potent than fentanyl.”</p>
<p>Launched in 2017, eWorldTrade[.]com now features <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-online-marketplace-operator-charged-trafficking-deadly-synthetic-opioids-stronger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a seizure notice</a> from the DOJ. eWorldTrade operated as a wholesale seller of consumer goods, including clothes, machinery, chemicals, automobiles and appliances. The DOJ’s indictment includes no additional details about eWorldTrade’s business, origins or other activity, and at first glance the website might appear to be a legitimate e-commerce platform that also just happened to sell some restricted chemicals</p>

<p>However, an investigation into the company’s founders reveals they are connected to a sprawling network of websites that have a history of extortionate scams involving trademark registration, book publishing, exam preparation, and the design of logos, mobile applications and websites.</p>
<p><a href="https://uspto.report/TM/98283759/ELR20240903134921/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Records</a> from the <strong>U.S. Patent and Trademark Office </strong>(USPTO) show the eWorldTrade mark is owned by an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/azneem-bilwani-1630291a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Azneem Bilwani </b></a>in Karachi (this name also is in the registration records for the now-seized eWorldTrade domain). Mr. Bilwani is perhaps better known as the director of the Pakistan-based IT provider <strong>Abtach Ltd.</strong>, which has been <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/TM-Show-Cause-Order-Abtach-et-al.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">singled out</a> by the USPTO <a href="https://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/data/wtr-investigation-exclusives/wtr-investigation-exclusives/article/google-blocks-ads-trademark-terminal-operator-abtach-following-uspto-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and Google</a> for operating trademark registration scams (the main offices for <span>eWorldtrade and Abtach share the same address in Pakistan).</span></p>
<p>In November 2021, the USPTO <a href="https://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/data/wtr-investigation-exclusives/wtr-investigation-exclusives/article/the-dangerous-legacy-of-axact-how-diploma-mill-in-pakistan-led-trademark-scam-epidemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused Abtach</a> of perpetrating “an egregious scheme to deceive and defraud applicants for federal trademark registrations by improperly altering official USPTO correspondence, overcharging application filing fees, misappropriating the USPTO’s trademarks, and impersonating the USPTO.”</p>
<p>Abtach offered trademark registration at suspiciously low prices compared to legitimate costs of over USD $1,500, and claimed they could register a trademark in 24 hours. Abtach reportedly <a href="https://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/data/wtr-investigation-exclusives/wtr-investigation-exclusives/article/abtach-rebrands-intersys-after-being-banned-uspto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebranded </a>to <strong>Intersys Limited</strong> after the USPTO banned Abtach from filing any more trademark applications.</p>

<h2>FROM AXACT TO ABTACH</h2>
<p>Many of Abtach’s employees are former associates of a similar company in Pakistan called <strong>Axact</strong> that was targeted by Pakistani authorities in a 2015 fraud investigation. Axact came under law enforcement scrutiny after <strong>The New York Times</strong> ran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/18/world/asia/fake-diplomas-real-cash-pakistani-company-axact-reaps-millions-columbiana-barkley.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a front-page story</a> about the company’s most lucrative scam business: Hundreds of sites peddling fake college degrees and diplomas.</p>
<p><span>People who purchased fake certifications were subsequently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/world/asia/pakistan-axact-degree-scam.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blackmailed by Axact employees posing as government officials</a>, who would demand additional payments under threats of prosecution or imprisonment for having bought fraudulent “unauthorized” academic degrees. This practice created a continuous cycle of extortion, internally referred to as “upselling.” </span></p>
<p>“Axact took money from at least 215,000 people in 197 countries — one-third of them from the United States,” The Times reported. “Sales agents wielded threats and false promises and impersonated government officials, earning the company at least $89 million in its final year of operation.”</p>
<p>Dozens of top Axact employees were arrested, jailed, held for months, tried and sentenced to seven years for various fraud violations. But a 2019 research brief on Axact’s diploma mills found none of those convicted had started their prison sentence, and that several had fled Pakistan and never returned.</p>
<p>“In October 2016, a Pakistan district judge acquitted 24 Axact officials at trial due to ‘not enough evidence’ and then later admitted he had accepted a bribe (of $35,209) from Axact,” reads <a href="https://www.aacrao.org/docs/default-source/webinar-documents/94-4-academic-fraud-and-the-worlds-largest-diploma-mill.pdf?sfvrsn=4b276f1f_2#:~:text=Dozens%20of%20top%20Axact%20ex,was%20caught%20at%20the%20airport." target="_blank" rel="noopener">a history</a> (PDF) published by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.</p>
<p>In 2021, Pakistan’s <strong>Federal Investigation Agency</strong> (FIA) charged Bilwani and nearly four dozen others — many of them Abtach employees — with running an elaborate trademark scam. The authorities <a href="https://files.lbr.cloud/public/2021-02/report.pdf?nh3DUDQa7dd3jS63lsAN2dWDbHIQjplS=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called it</a> “the biggest money laundering case in the history of Pakistan,” and named a number of businesses based in Texas that allegedly helped move the proceeds of cybercrime.</p>

Mansoor’s </span><b><span>U.K.-registered company </span></b><a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/officers/9Xl14hjK0LtYFKRI7kI_werr3As/appointments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Maple Solutions Direct Limited</span></a> <b><span>has run at least 700 ads for logo design websites since 2015, the Google Ads Transparency page <a href="https://adstransparency.google.com/advertiser/AR16545428366065401857?region=anywhere" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>.

<div id="attachment_71135"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71135" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/junaidmansoor.png" alt="" width="692" height="290"></p><p id="caption-attachment-71135">Junaid Mansoor. Source: youtube/@Olevels․com School.</p></div>
<p><span>Mr. Mansoor is actively involved with and promoting a Quran study business called <strong>quranmasteronline[.]com</strong>, which was founded by Junaid’s brother <strong>Qasim Mansoor</strong> (Qasim is also named in the FIA criminal investigation). The Google ads promoting quranmasteronline[.]com were paid for by <a href="https://adstransparency.google.com/advertiser/AR14975696108041273345?region=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the same account</a> advertising a number of scam websites selling logo and web design services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Junaid Mansoor did not respond to requests for comment. An address in Teaneck, New Jersey where Mr. Mansoor previously lived <a href="https://www.mapquest.com/us/new-jersey/exporthub-378873083" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is listed as an official address of exporthub[.]com</a>, a Pakistan-based e-commerce website that appears remarkably similar to eWorldTrade (Exporthub says its offices are in Texas). Interestingly, a search in Google for this domain shows ExportHub currently features <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aexporthub.com+fentanyl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple listings for fentanyl citrate</a> from suppliers in China and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The CEO of Digitonics Labs is <strong>Muhammad Burhan Mirza</strong>, a former Axact official who was arrested by the FIA as part of its money laundering and trademark fraud investigation in 2021. In 2023, prosecutors in Pakistan charged Mirza, Mansoor and 14 other Digitonics employees with fraud, impersonating government officials, phishing, cheating and extortion. Mirza’s LinkedIn profile says he currently runs an educational technology/life coach enterprise called <strong>TheCoach360</strong>, which purports to help young kids “achieve financial independence.”</p>
<p>Reached via LinkedIn, Mr. Mirza denied having anything to do with eWorldTrade or any of its sister companies in Texas.</p>
<p>“Moreover, I have no knowledge as to the companies you have mentioned,” said Mr. Mirza, who did not respond to follow-up questions.</p>
<p>The current disposition of the FIA’s fraud case against the defendants is unclear. The investigation was marred early on by allegations of corruption and bribery. In 2021, Pakistani authorities alleged Bilwani paid a six-figure bribe to FIA investigators. Meanwhile, attorneys for Mr. Bilwani <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/194s1jG24OE2KjHtOhfGu51i6NhCFGV2X/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have argued</a> that although their client did pay a bribe, the payment was solicited by government officials. Mr. Bilwani did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<h2>THE TEXAS NEXUS</h2>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity has learned that the people and entities at the center of the FIA investigations have built a significant presence in the United States, with a strong concentration in Texas. The Texas businesses promote websites that sell logo and web design, ghostwriting, and academic cheating services. Many of these entities have recently been sued for fraud and breach of contract by angry former customers, who claimed the companies relentlessly upsold them while failing to produce the work as promised.</p>
<p>For example, the FIA complaints named <strong>Retrocube LLC </strong>and <strong>360 Digital Marketing LLC</strong>, two entities that share a street address with eWorldTrade: 1910 Pacific Avenue, Suite 8025, Dallas, Texas. Also incorporated at that Pacific Avenue address is <strong>abtach[.]ae</strong>, a web design and marketing firm based in Dubai; and <strong>intersyslimited[.]com</strong>, the new name of Abtach after they were banned by the USPTO. Other businesses registered at this address market services for logo design, mobile app development, and ghostwriting.</p>

<p>360 Digital Marketing’s website 360digimarketing[.]com is owned by an Abtach front company called <strong>Abtech LTD</strong>.

<p>Google’s Ads Transparency Center finds 360 Digital Marketing LLC ran at least 500 ads promoting various websites selling ghostwriting services . Another entity tied to Junaid Mansoor — a company called <strong>Octa Group Technologies AU</strong> — has run <a href="https://adstransparency.google.com/advertiser/AR08603440443079786497?region=anywhere" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approximately 300 Google ads</a> for book publishing services, promoting confusingly named websites like <span>amazonlistinghub[.]com and barnesnoblepublishing[.]co.</span></p>

<h2>VICTIMS SPEAK OUT</h2>
<p>Ms. Will’s lawsuit is just one of more than two dozen complaints over the past four years wherein plaintiffs sued one of this group’s web design, wiki editing or ghostwriting services. In 2021, a New Jersey man <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HOXxv4GP3-zz2tujPYHChmWBY6KUc70P/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued Octagroup Technologies</a>, alleging they ripped him off when he paid a total of more than $26,000 for the design and marketing of a web-based mapping service.</p>
<p>The plaintiff in that case did not respond to requests for comment, but his complaint alleges Octagroup and a myriad other companies it contracted with produced minimal work product despite subjecting him to relentless upselling. That case was decided in favor of the plaintiff because the defendants never contested the matter in court.</p>
<p>In 2023, 360 Digital Marketing LLC and Retrocube LLC were sued by a woman who said they scammed her out of $40,000 over a book she wanted help writing. That lawsuit helpfully showed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w_6-RqZl7GBea-WtdgFkv6xHRVWaG5DV/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an image of the office front door</a> at 1910 Pacific Ave Suite 8025, which featured the logos of 360 Digital Marketing, Retrocube, and eWorldTrade.</p>
<div id="attachment_71140"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71140" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/360digitalmarketingfrontdoorintexas.png" alt="" width="611" height="763"></p><p id="caption-attachment-71140">The front door at 1910 Pacific Avenue, Suite 8025, Dallas, Texas.</p></div>
<p>The lawsuit was filed pro se by <strong>Leigh Riley</strong>, a 64-year-old career IT professional who paid 360 Digital Marketing to have a company called <strong>Talented Ghostwriter</strong> co-author and promote a series of books she’d outlined on spirituality and healing.</p>
<p>“The main reason I hired them was because I didn’t understand what I call the formula for writing a book, and I know there’s a lot of marketing that goes into publishing,” Riley explained in an interview. “I know nothing about that stuff, and these guys were convincing that they could handle all aspects of it. Until I discovered they couldn’t write a damn sentence in English properly.”</p>
<p>Riley’s well-documented lawsuit (not linked here because it features a great deal of personal information) includes screenshots of conversations with the ghostwriting team, which was constantly assigning her to new writers and editors, and ghosting her on scheduled conference calls about progress on the project. Riley said she ended up writing most of the book herself because the work they produced was unusable.</p>
<p>“Finally after months of promising the books were printed and on their way, they show up at my doorstep with the wrong title on the book,” Riley said. When she demanded her money back, she said the people helping her with the website to promote the book locked her out of the site.</p>
<div id="attachment_71203"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71203" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rileylawsuit.png" alt="" width="754" height="686"></p><p id="caption-attachment-71203">A conversation snippet from Leigh Riley’s lawsuit against Talented Ghostwriter, aka 360 Digital Marketing LLC. “Other companies once they have you money they don’t even respond or do anything,” the ghostwriting team manager explained.</p></div>
<p>Riley decided to sue, naming 360 Digital Marketing LLC and Retrocube LLC, among others.&nbsp; The companies offered to settle the matter for $20,000, which she accepted. “I didn’t have money to hire a lawyer, and I figured it was time to cut my losses,” she said.</p>
<p>Riley said she could have saved herself a great deal of headache by doing some basic research on Talented Ghostwriter, whose website claims the company is based in Los Angeles. According to the California Secretary of State, however, there is no registered entity by that name. Rather, the address claimed by <strong>talentedghostwriter[.]com</strong> is a vacant office building with a “space available” sign in the window.</p>
<p>California resident <strong>Walter Horsting </strong>discovered something similar when he&nbsp;sued 360 Digital Marketing in small claims court last year, after hiring a company called <strong>Vox Ghostwriting</strong> to help write, edit and promote a spy novel he’d been working on. Horsting said he paid Vox $3,300 to ghostwrite a 280-page book, and was upsold an Amazon marketing and publishing package for $7,500.</p>
<p>In an interview, Horsting said the prose that Vox Ghostwriting produced was “juvenile at best,” forcing him to rewrite and edit the work himself, and to partner with a graphical artist to produce illustrations. Horsting said that when it came time to begin marketing the novel, Vox Ghostwriting tried to further upsell him on marketing packages, while dodging scheduled meetings with no follow-up.</p>
<p>“They have a money back guarantee, and when they wouldn’t refund my money I said I’m taking you to court,” Horsting recounted. “I tried to serve them in Los Angeles but found no such office exists. I talked to a salon next door and they said someone else had recently shown up desperately looking for where the ghostwriting company went, and it appears there are a trail of corpses on this. I finally tracked down where they are in Texas.”</p>
<p>It was the same office that Ms. Riley served her lawsuit against. Horsting said he has a court hearing scheduled later this month, but he’s under no illusions that winning the case means he’ll be able to collect.</p>
<p>“At this point, I’m doing it out of pride more than actually expecting anything to come to good fortune for me,” he said.</p>
<p>The following mind map was helpful in piecing together key events, individuals and connections mentioned above. It’s important to note that this graphic only scratches the surface of the operations tied to this group. For example, in Case 2 we can see mention of academic cheating services, wherein people can be hired to take online proctored exams on one’s behalf. Those who hire these services soon find themselves subject to impersonation and blackmail attempts for larger and larger sums of money, with the threat of publicly exposing their unethical academic cheating activity.</p>

<h2>GOOGLE RESPONDS</h2>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity reviewed the Google Ad Transparency links for nearly 500 different websites tied to this network of ghostwriting, logo, app and web development businesses. Those website names were then fed into <strong>spyfu.com</strong>, a competitive intelligence company that tracks the reach and performance of advertising keywords. Spyfu estimates that between April 2023 and April 2025, those websites <em>spent more than $10 million on Google ads</em>.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Google said in a written statement that it is constantly policing its ad network for bad actors, pointing to <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/ads_safety_report_2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an ads safety report</a> (PDF) showing Google blocked or removed 5.1 billion bad ads last year — including more than 500 million ads related to trademarks.</p>
<p>“Our policy against Enabling Dishonest Behavior prohibits products or services that help users mislead others, including ads for paper-writing or exam-taking services,” the statement reads. “When we identify ads or advertisers that violate our policies, we take action, including by suspending advertiser accounts, disapproving ads, and restricting ads to specific domains when appropriate.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/googleadpolicyenforcement.png" alt="" width="749" height="490" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/googleadpolicyenforcement.png 980w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/googleadpolicyenforcement-768x502.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/googleadpolicyenforcement-782x511.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p>
<p>Google did not respond to specific questions about the advertising entities mentioned in this story, saying only that “we are actively investigating this matter and addressing any policy violations, including suspending advertiser accounts when appropriate.”</p>
<p>From reviewing the ad accounts that have been promoting these scam websites, it appears Google has very recently acted to remove a large number of the offending ads. Prior to my notifying Google about the extent of this ad network on April 28, the Google Ad Transparency network listed over 500 ads for 360 Digital Marketing; as of this publication, that number had <a href="https://adstransparency.google.com/advertiser/AR11727645009044832257?region=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dwindled to 10</a>.</p>
<p>On April 30, Google <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/16189141?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=16083443" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that starting this month its ads transparency page will display the payment profile name as the payer name for verified advertisers, if that name differs from their verified advertiser name. Searchengineland.com <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-adds-to-its-transparency-rules-for-who-is-paying-for-ads-454899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> the changes are aimed at increasing accountability in digital advertising.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xZ4yHTsWxnTtEVrazDbqWQY5Vju8USeBfszCGl6uxfc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This spreadsheet</a> lists the domain names, advertiser names, and Google Ad Transparency links for more than 350 entities offering ghostwriting, publishing, web design and academic cheating services.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>June Huh often finds himself lost. Every afternoon, he takes a long walk around Princeton University, where he’s a professor in the mathematics department. On this particular day in mid-May, he’s making his way through the woods around the nearby Institute for Advanced Study — “Just so you know,” he says as he considers a fork in the path ahead, “I don’t know where we are” — pausing every so often to point out the subtle movements of wildlife hiding beneath leaves or behind trees. Among the animals he spots over the next two hours of wandering are a pair of frogs, a red-crested bird, a turtle the size of a thimble, and a quick-footed fox, each given its own quiet moment of observation.</p>
<p>“I’m very good at finding stuff,” he says. “That’s one of my special abilities.”</p>
<p>Huh, 39, has now been awarded the Fields Medal, the highest honor in mathematics, for his ability to wander through mathematical landscapes and find just the right objects — objects that he then uses to get the seemingly disparate fields of geometry and combinatorics to talk to each other in new and exciting ways. Starting in graduate school, he has solved several major problems in combinatorics, forging a circuitous route by way of other branches of math to get to the heart of each proof. Every time, finding that path is akin to a “little miracle,” Huh said.</p>
<p>One might say the same of his path into mathematics itself: that it was characterized by much wandering and a series of small miracles. When he was younger, Huh had no desire to be a mathematician. He was indifferent to the subject, and he dropped out of high school to become a poet. It would take a chance encounter during his university years — and many moments of feeling lost — for him to find that mathematics held what he’d been looking for all along.</p>


    
<p>That poetic detour has since proved crucial to his mathematical breakthroughs. His artistry, according to his colleagues, is evident in the way he uncovers those just-right objects at the center of his work, and in the way he seeks a deeper significance in everything he does. “Mathematicians are a lot like artists in that really we’re looking for beauty,” said <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-federico-ardila-dances-to-the-joys-and-sorrows-of-discovery-20171120/">Federico Ardila-Mantilla</a>, a mathematician at San Francisco State University and one of Huh’s collaborators. “But I think in his case, it’s really pronounced. And I just really like his taste. He makes beautiful things.”</p>
<p>“When I found out that he came to mathematics after poetry, I’m like, OK, this makes sense to me,” Ardila added.</p>
<p>Huh himself draws parallels between the artist and the mathematician. For both, he said, “it feels like you’re grabbing something that’s already there, rather than creating something in your mind.”</p>

<p>On any given day, Huh does about three hours of focused work. He might think about a math problem, or prepare to lecture a classroom of students, or schedule doctor’s appointments for his two sons. “Then I’m exhausted,” he said. “Doing something that’s valuable, meaningful, creative” — or a task that he doesn’t particularly want to do, like scheduling those appointments — “takes away a lot of your energy.”</p>
<p>To hear him tell it, he doesn’t usually have much control over what he decides to focus on in those three hours. For a few months in the spring of 2019, all he did was read. He felt an urge to revisit books he’d first encountered when he was younger — including <em>Meditations</em> by the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and several novels by the German author Hermann Hesse — so that’s what he did. “Which means I didn’t do any work,” Huh said. “So that’s kind of a problem.” (He’s since made peace with this constraint, though. “I used to try to resist … but I finally learned to give up to those temptations.” As a consequence, “I became better and better at ignoring deadlines.”)</p>

    <p>He finds that forcing himself to do something or defining a specific goal — even for something he enjoys — never works. It’s particularly difficult for him to move his attention from one thing to another. “I think intention and willpower … are highly overrated,” he said. “You rarely achieve anything with those things.”</p>
<p>This has been the case since he was young. He was born in 1983 in California, where his parents were finishing graduate school. The family then moved to Seoul, South Korea, when Huh was around 2 years old. There, his father taught statistics, his mother Russian language and literature.</p>
<p>School was excruciating for him. He loved to learn but couldn’t focus or absorb anything in a classroom setting. Instead, he preferred to read on his own — in elementary school, he devoured all 10 volumes of an encyclopedia about living things — and to explore a mountain near his family’s apartment. He quickly became familiar with every corner of it, but he still managed to get lost, one time even ending up in an area that was restricted due to the possible presence of land mines.</p>
<p>He tried his best to avoid math whenever possible. His father once tried to teach him out of a workbook, but rather than try to solve the problems, Huh would copy the solutions from the back. When his father caught on and tore those pages out, Huh went to a local bookstore and wrote down the answers there. “He gave up at that point,” Huh said.</p>
<p>When he was 16 years old and in the middle of his first year in high school (which lasts for three years in South Korea), he decided to drop out to write poetry. He was something of a romantic. “I could literally physically cry after listening to good music,” he said. He wrote about nature and about his own experiences. He planned to complete his masterpiece in the two years before he’d have to attend university. “So that didn’t happen,” he laughed.</p>
<p>He found the writing process too focused on the self — and for him, that exploration was often painful and depressing. Moreover, as he later realized, “I wanted to be someone who writes great poetry,” he said. “I didn’t want to write great poetry.” Now he sees that version of himself as almost a complete stranger.</p>
<p>When he entered Seoul National University in 2002, he felt adrift. He briefly flirted with the idea of being a science writer and decided to major in astronomy and physics. But he frequently skipped class, and he had to retake several courses. “I was just generally lost,” he said. “I didn’t know what I wanted to do. I didn’t know what I was good at.”</p>
<p>It turned out that he was good at math after all — something he discovered entirely by accident.</p>
<h2><strong>True Beauty</strong></h2>
<p>It took Huh six years to graduate. In that sixth year, he enrolled in a class taught by the famed Japanese mathematician Heisuke Hironaka, who <a href="https://www.mathunion.org/imu-awards/fields-medal/fields-medals-1970">won the Fields Medal in 1970</a>. Hironaka was charismatic, and Huh quickly fell under his sway.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t just his professor’s charm that attracted Huh that first day in class. It was also the math itself. Ostensibly, the course was an introduction to algebraic geometry, the study of solutions to algebraic equations and their geometric properties. Instead, Hironaka taught his own work in an area called singularity theory, which focuses on certain types of spaces. “Basically, he lectured about what he thought about yesterday,” Huh said — a very particular problem, and proofs that weren’t necessarily correct. What began as a 200-student class quickly dwindled; a few weeks later, only five students were left, Huh among them.</p>
<p>For the first time, he witnessed research mathematics unfolding in real time. Hironaka’s lectures weren’t polished as in other undergraduate courses, where everything was streamlined, the answers already worked out. Huh loved the suspense of it, the act of trying to do something no one really knew how to do — and the freedom that came with not knowing, the surprises that became possible. The typical material taught in college has been refined over the course of centuries, he said. “That’s very different from observing this raw mathematics in front of your eyes.”</p>

    <p>Huh discovered that this kind of mathematics could give him what poetry could not: the ability to search for beauty outside himself, to try to grasp something external, objective and true, in a way that opened him up more than writing ever had. “You don’t think about your small self,” he said. “There’s no place for ego.” He found that unlike when he was a poet, he was never motivated by the desire for recognition. He just wanted to do math.</p>
<p>Hironaka, perhaps recognizing this, took him under his wing. After Huh graduated and started a master’s program at Seoul National University — where he also met Nayoung Kim, now his wife — he spent a lot of time with Hironaka. During breaks, he followed the professor back to Japan, staying with him in Tokyo and Kyoto, carrying his bags, sharing meals, and of course continuing to discuss math.</p>
<h2><strong>An Unexpected Discovery</strong></h2>
<p>Huh applied to about a dozen doctoral programs in the U.S. But because of his undistinguished undergraduate experience, he was rejected by all of them save one. In 2009, he began his studies at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, before transferring to the University of Michigan in 2011 to complete his doctorate.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges — living in a new country, spending time apart from Kim (she stayed at Seoul National University for her doctorate in mathematics) — Huh cherished his experiences in graduate school. He was able to dedicate himself wholly to math, and he relished the freedom of exploration that had drawn him to the subject in the first place.</p>
<p>He immediately stood out. As a beginning graduate student in Illinois, he <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/jams/2012-25-03/S0894-0347-2012-00731-0/">proved a conjecture in graph theory</a> that had been open for 40 years. In its simplest form, the problem, known as Read’s conjecture, concerned polynomials — equations like <em>n</em><sup>4</sup> + 5<em>n</em><sup>3</sup> + 6<em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 3<em>n</em> + 1 — attached to graphs, which are collections of vertices (points) connected by edges (lines). In particular, let’s say you want to color the vertices of a graph so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Given a certain number of colors at your disposal, there are many ways to color the graph. It turns out that the total number of possibilities can be calculated using an equation called the chromatic polynomial (which is written in terms of the number of colors being used).</p>
<p>Mathematicians observed that the coefficients of chromatic polynomials, no matter the graph, always seem to obey certain patterns. First, they are unimodal, meaning they increase and then decrease. Take the previous example of a polynomial. The absolute values of its coefficients — 1, 5, 6, 3, 1 — form a unimodal sequence. Moreover, that sequence is also “log concave.” For any three consecutive numbers in the sequence, the square of the middle number is at least as large as the product of the terms on either side of it. (In the above polynomial, for instance, 6<sup>2</sup> ≥ 5 × 3.)</p>

    </figure>

<p>Still, mathematicians struggled to prove these properties. And then, seemingly out of nowhere, along came Huh.</p>
<p>As a master’s student, he had studied algebraic geometry and singularity theory with Hironaka. The main objects of study in that field are called algebraic varieties, which can be thought of as shapes defined by certain equations. Intriguingly, associated to certain kinds of algebraic varieties are numbers that are known to be log concave — something Huh only knew because of the serendipitous direction his studies had taken him in. Huh’s key idea was to find a way to construct an algebraic variety such that those associated numbers were precisely the coefficients of the chromatic polynomial of the graph from the original question.</p>
<p>His solution stunned the math community. It was at that point that the University of Michigan, having rejected his initial application, recruited him to their graduate program.</p>
<p>Huh’s achievement was impressive not just because he had solved Read’s conjecture when it had seemed completely intractable for so long. He had shown that something much deeper — and geometric — was lurking beneath combinatorial properties of graphs.</p>
<p>Mathematicians were also impressed by his demeanor. His talks at conferences were always accessible and concrete; in speaking with him, it was clear that he was thinking both deeply and broadly about the concepts he was working with. “He was ridiculously mature for a graduate student,” said <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mattbakermath/home/">Matthew Baker</a>, a mathematician at the Georgia Institute of Technology. After Baker met him for the first time, “I was just like, who is this guy?”</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mmustata/">Mircea Mustaţă</a>, Huh’s adviser at the University of Michigan, he required almost no supervision or guidance. Unlike most graduate students, he already had a program in mind, and ideas about how to pursue it. “He was more like a colleague,” Mustaţă said. “He already had his own way of looking at things.”</p>
<p>Many of his collaborators note that he’s incredibly humble and down-to-earth. When he learned he’d won the Fields Medal, “it didn’t really feel that good,” Huh said. “Of course you are happy, but deep down, you’re a little bit worried that they might eventually figure out that you’re not actually that good. I am a reasonably good mathematician, but am I Fields Medal-worthy?”</p>
<h2><strong>Escape From Space</strong></h2>
<p>Graphs are actually just one type of object that can define more general structures called matroids. Consider, for example, points on a two-dimensional plane. If more than two points lie on a line in this plane, you can say that those points are “dependent.” Matroids are abstract objects that capture notions like dependence and independence in all sorts of different contexts — from graphs to vector spaces to algebraic fields.</p>

        </figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>Just as graphs have chromatic polynomials associated with them, there are equations called characteristic polynomials attached to matroids. It was conjectured that the polynomials for these more general objects should also have coefficients that are log concave. But the techniques Huh used to prove Read’s conjecture only worked for showing log concavity for a very narrow class of matroids, such as the matroids that arise from graphs.</p>
<p>With the mathematician <a href="https://people.math.osu.edu/katz.60/">Eric Katz</a>, Huh <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00208-011-0777-6">broadened the class of matroids</a> such a proof could apply to. They followed a recipe of sorts. As before, the strategy was to start with the object of interest — here, a matroid — and use it to construct an algebraic variety. From there, they could extract an object called a cohomology ring and use some of its properties to prove log concavity.</p>
<p>There was just one problem. Most matroids don’t have any sort of geometric foundation, which means there’s not actually an algebraic variety to associate to them. Instead, Huh, Katz and the mathematician <a href="http://www.math.huji.ac.il/~adiprasito/">Karim Adiprasito</a> figured out a way to write down the right cohomology ring straight from the matroid, essentially from scratch. They then showed, using a new set of techniques, that it behaved as if it had come from an actual algebraic variety, even though it hadn’t. In doing so, they proved log concavity for all matroids, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-path-less-taken-to-the-peak-of-the-math-world-20170627/">resolving the problem known as Rota’s conjecture</a> once and for all. “It’s pretty remarkable that it works,” Baker said.</p>
<p>The work showed that “you don’t need space to do geometry,” Huh said. “That made me really fundamentally rethink what geometry is.” It would also guide him toward a host of other problems, where he continued to push that idea further, allowing him to develop an even broader range of methods.</p>
<p>But for all the specificity the work requires, building the right cohomology ring requires massive amounts of guesswork and groping around in the dark. It was an aspect of the work that Huh particularly enjoyed. “There is no guiding principle … no clearly defined goal,” he said. “You just have to make a guess.”</p>

    <p>That lack of intention precisely mirrors how he functions best in his day-to-day life, too. It was as if he’d uncovered a mathematical program that perfectly fit his personality. Once again, he found that “things just happen by themselves,” Huh said.</p>
<h2><strong>The Heart of Things</strong></h2>
<p>Huh speaks slowly, pausing often and choosing his words carefully, and carries himself in a calm, peaceful manner that borders on meditative. “He doesn’t get so easily excited,” said <a href="https://people.math.wisc.edu/~wang/">Botong Wang</a>, a mathematician at the University of Wisconsin, Madison who has collaborated with Huh on a number of important recent results.</p>
<p>He proceeds just as deliberately when doing mathematics. Wang was shocked when he first witnessed it. “I have this math competition experience, that as a mathematician you have to be clever, you have to be fast,” he said. “But June is the opposite. … If you talk to him for five minutes about some calculus problem, you’d think this guy wouldn’t pass a qualifying exam. He’s very slow.” So slow, in fact, that at first Wang thought they were wasting a lot of time on easy problems they already understood. But then he realized that Huh was learning even seemingly simple concepts in a much deeper way — and in precisely the way that would later prove useful.</p>
<p>“June likes to do things in the right way,” said <a href="http://gdenham.math.uwo.ca/">Graham Denham</a>, a mathematician at Western University in Ontario and one of Huh’s collaborators.</p>
<p>For instance, Denham, Ardila and Huh had just completed a 50-page proof of a problem closely related to Rota’s conjecture when Huh said they should take some more time to find a cleaner, more appealing approach. He thought there was a nicer explanation out there, and that it was best not to rush things. “Federico and I were like, oh, OK, so we’ll just chuck that, then, shall we?” Denham said.</p>
<p>It took two years to craft <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13116">the better argument</a>. “It’s good we’re all tenured,” Ardila said. Ultimately, though, Ardila and Denham agreed that the extra work was worth it. Their end result “was totally different, and deeper, and [got to] the heart of things,” Ardila said.</p>

<p>This approach doesn’t just apply to Huh’s mathematical work. In 2013, he decided he wanted to learn to cook. As a total beginner, he adopted the strategy of making the same dish — a simple pasta in oil — every day until it was perfect. For six months, that’s exactly what he did. (To date, according to Kim, that’s the only dish he knows how to cook.)</p>
<p>Huh’s entire life is built on routine. “Almost all of my days are exactly the same,” he said. “I have a very high tolerance for repetition.” He has trouble staying asleep and usually wakes up at around 3 a.m. He then goes to the gym, has breakfast with his wife and two sons (one is 8 years old, the other just turned 1), and walks his eldest to school before heading to his Princeton office.</p>
<p>The office is spare, practically empty. There’s a large desk, a couch for sleeping — Huh typically takes a nap later in the morning — and a yoga mat rolled out on the floor (just for lying down, he said; he doesn’t actually know how to do yoga). No books, just a few stacks of papers neatly arranged on a shelf against one wall. In the corner is a vacuum cleaner. Huh likes repetitive, mindless activities like cleaning, dishwashing and the physical act of transcribing what he reads into a notebook.</p>
<p>He often works in the public library, in the children’s section, where it’s pretty noisy. “I don’t like quiet places,” he said. “It makes me sleepy.” Huh says this about many things.</p>
<p>He goes for a long walk after lunch each day, then returns to his office to do some more work (unless he’s already hit his three-hour quota) before heading home. He spends the rest of the evening with his family; they all go to sleep, together in one large bed, at around 9 p.m.</p>
<p>This preference for routine — and the tendency to get exhausted by anything that strays from it — can sometimes manifest in extreme ways. When he was completing his doctorate in Michigan, for instance, “I would cut off almost everything else,” Huh said. When he first moved to Ann Arbor, he found himself unequipped for the brutal winter. He had few belongings, and he needed a blanket. But when he looked up how to get to the local mall, he found it too logistically difficult. “It was just beyond my level of tolerance,” he said. “I did not want to waste my mental energy on figuring out how to go from here to there.” Instead, he walked to a nearby CVS drugstore, bought 10 squares of fabric and a giant stapler, and stapled the squares together to make a blanket.</p>

    <p>He lived off frozen pizza for months at a time because he didn’t want to deal with getting groceries and cooking. He just wanted to do math. He describes that period of his life as “almost monastic.” In fact, at the time, he really only spoke with another person — Mustaţă, his adviser — once a week.</p>
<p>Kim recalls visiting Huh when he was still in Illinois, and “after that, I really rethought our relationship,” she said. “Should I marry him? Because he [cannot] handle real-life skills, surviving skills.”</p>
<p>Yet marry him she did, in 2014. They moved to Princeton, where they both started work at the Institute for Advanced Study. It was Kim’s first time living in the U.S., and she felt uncomfortable taking care of certain tasks in English; she had to depend on Huh to get things done. “Let’s just say, she was disappointed,” he said.</p>
<p>Later that year, Kim gave birth to their first son, Dan. While in labor, she caught Huh doing math.</p>
<p>“My wife is a much more balanced person than I am,” he said. “Life has very many facets, and math is a very, very, very tiny part of it.”</p>
<p>“I’m a real worker,” Kim said. “He is a thinker.”</p>
<p>But, she added, Huh has improved drastically since then. As the couple raised Dan, “I learned how to live a more balanced life,” Huh said. “That was a transformative period.” He spends a lot of time with Dan — drawing with him, solving problems in intricate math workbooks that Dan creates for him, and taking him to the bookstore and other local spots. He even takes care of the logistical tasks that Kim asks him to do, albeit begrudgingly. “I still don’t like it,” he said, “but I mean, we cannot just live with stapled blankets.”</p>
<p>Now he’s even able to step away from mathematics. His mind no longer returns to working on problems when he’s in an idle state, and he’s able to take a break when something else requires him to.</p>
<p>“He’s a totally different person,” Kim said.</p>
<h2><strong>Heavy on Top</strong></h2>
<p>Regardless, some things haven’t changed. Huh can still muster only enough energy to work for a few hours each day. “Other people work one hour and just take a five-minute rest,” Kim said. “He is like, one hour do something else, and just focus for five minutes, 10 minutes.”</p>
<p>His search for beauty hasn’t changed either. And often he returns to questions about log concavity or similar concepts as a way to unearth that beauty.</p>

<p>For instance, he, Wang and other collaborators recently proved a fundamental problem about configurations of points, lines and planes called the Dowling-Wilson “top-heavy” conjecture. Consider a finite collection of points in the plane, where every pair of points is connected by a line. The mathematicians Paul Erdős and Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn showed that the number of lines must always be greater than or equal to the number of points (unless all the points are located on one line). Consider, for example, four points arranged at the corners of a square. Lines trace out the square and also connect opposite corners, adding up to six lines in total.</p>
<p>The top-heavy conjecture generalizes this idea. Instead of the plane, you’re given a set of points in some high-dimensional space. Consider all the lines that connect pairs of points, the planes spanned by sets of three points, the three-dimensional subspaces constructed from four points, and so on. Now think about a sequence built from these numbers: the number of points, the number of lines, the number of planes. Compare numbers in symmetric positions in that sequence (the first and last numbers, the second and penultimate numbers, and so on). The number corresponding to the higher-dimensional space will be at least as large — that is, the sequence is top-heavy. (This sequence is also conjectured to be log concave, but that has not yet been proved; so far, Huh and Wang have shown that the first half of the sequence is unimodal.)</p>

    <p>Huh and Wang adapted ideas from Huh’s work on Rota’s conjecture, but in doing so they had to push his program further. Again, they were working with matroids, algebraic varieties and cohomology rings. But this time the algebraic varieties they had to find involved singularities, places where a space looks different when you zoom in on it than it does at other points. That made it much more complicated to <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/acta-mathematica/volume-218/issue-2/Enumeration-of-points-lines-planes-etc/10.4310/ACTA.2017.v218.n2.a2.full">build the right spaces</a> and prove certain properties about their cohomology rings — and even more difficult to solve the case where they had to construct those rings <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06088">straight from the matroids</a>, without algebraic varieties to guide them.</p>
<p>During the five years they spent solving this problem, Huh also started investigating a way to complete the break from geometry. So much of his work until then involved the arduous task of building the exact cohomology that a problem required. Moreover, once that cohomology is found, mathematicians still have to prove that it satisfies certain properties, which can also take years.</p>

    <p>The new theory that he developed (along with the mathematician <a href="https://www.kth.se/profile/pbranden">Petter Brändén</a>) was able to bypass those methods entirely. It allowed them to <a href="https://annals.math.princeton.edu/2020/192-3/p04">solve a problem</a> called the strong Mason conjecture (which asks questions about the number of independent sets in matroids), and other mathematicians have already used it to re-prove Rota’s conjecture in a more straightforward way. But even more important, it opens the door to finding entirely new problems, hints at an even deeper explanation for why all these log concavity statements are true, and intersects with problems in theoretical computer science in intriguing ways that are just beginning to be explored.</p>
<h2><strong>Click of the Connection</strong></h2>
        
        
<p>For Huh, when he is working, there’s something almost subconscious going on. In fact, he usually can’t trace how or when his ideas come to him. He doesn’t have sudden flashes of insight. Instead, “at some point, you just realize, oh, I know this,” he said. Maybe last week, he didn’t understand something, but now, without any additional input, the pieces have clicked into place without his realizing it. He likens it to the way your mind can surprise you and create unexpected connections when you’re dreaming. “It’s just amazing what human minds are capable of,” he said. “And it’s nice to admit that we don’t know what’s going on.”</p>
<p>Perhaps this, too, speaks to the artist in him. He hopes to continue uncovering unexpected connections between different areas of math.</p>
<p>“He just follows the vision of this original program that he had … already as a graduate student,” Baker said. “It will be very interesting to see what the limits are.”</p>
<p>So far, Huh hasn’t hit them. And mathematicians are sure he’ll continue to make beautiful things.</p>
<p>When asked if he’d ever entertain the earlier version of his artist self and try writing poetry again, he shrugged. “Maybe. But I don’t know,” he said. “I’m very much into something else.”</p>

We’ve noticed that the term “GPU utilization” gets used to mean very different things by people solving problems at different parts of the stack. So we put together this article to share our framework for thinking about GPU utilization across the stack and the tips and tricks we’ve learned along the way.</p> <p>In particular, we’ll talk about three very different things that all get called “GPU utilization”:</p> <ul><li><a href="#what-is-gpu-allocation-utilization"><!----><!---->GPU Allocation Utilization<!----></a><!---->, the fraction of your GPUs that are running application code,</li> <li><a href="#what-is-gpu-kernel-utilization"><!----><!---->GPU Kernel Utilization<!----></a><!---->, the fraction of time your application is running code on GPUs, and</li> <li><a href="#what-is-model-flops-utilization-mfu"><!----><!---->Model FLOP/s Utilization<!----></a><!---->, the fraction of the GPUs’ theoretical arithmetic bandwidth your application is using to run models.</li></ul> <p>We’ll specifically focus on neural network inference workloads — neural networks because they are workload generating the most demand right now and inference because, unlike training, inference is a revenue center not a cost center. We’re betting on the revenue center.</p> <h2 id="what-is-utilization">What is utilization?</h2> <h3 id="utilization--output-achieved--capacity-paid-for">Utilization = Output achieved ÷ Capacity paid for</h3> <p><em>Utilization</em> relates the available capacity of a system to that system’s output.</p> <p>In throughput-oriented systems like GPU applications, the capacity paid for is often a <em>bandwidth</em> (e.g. the arithmetic bandwidth) and the output achieved is then a <em>throughput</em> (e.g. floating point operations per second, FLOP/s).</p> <p>Because it is a ratio, utilization is unitless. That means <strong>there are actually many GPU-related quantities you might call “GPU utilization”</strong>, leaving off the implicit units of the capacity and output. These different quantities range across orders of magnitude of time and across different organizational capacities (e.g. procurement, DevOps, and low-level performance engineering).</p> <h2 id="what-is-gpu-allocation-utilization">What is GPU Allocation Utilization?</h2> <h3 id="gpu-allocation-utilization--gpu-seconds-running-application-code--gpu-seconds-paid-for">GPU Allocation Utilization = GPU-seconds running application code ÷ GPU-seconds paid for</h3> <p>First, consider the number of GPUs that you have allocated — whether that is fixed GPU capacity on-premise in your basement (or data center) or it is rented capacity in a cloud data center (or many people’s basements) — across a period of time.</p> <p>We use the term <em>GPU Allocation Utilization</em> for the fraction of those GPU-seconds during which you were running application code. This is the highest-level notion of “GPU utilization”.</p> <p>There are two key limits on GPU Allocation Utilization: economic and developer-operational.</p> <p>The economic limits on GPU Allocation Utilization rise from combined technical and market limitations. Purchasing, commissioning, decomissioning, and selling GPUs cannot be done as quickly as the output demanded by the application changes (on the scale of seconds or minutes).</p> <p>Of course, as for other hardware we are blessed with highly-virtualized data center platforms (“clouds”) where we can virtually allocate and de-allocate GPU capacity. Even there, however, existing pricing models and demand that exceeds supply leave providers dictating terms, like multi-month or multi-year commitments, which limit achievable utilization for a given quality-of-service.</p> <div><p><h3>With a fixed, over-provisioned GPU allocation, utilization is low</h3> <!--[!--><!--]--></p>  <!--[--><!--]--></div> <p>Modal helps organizations solve this problem. We aggregate GPU demand across consumers and GPU supply across providers to improve GPU allocation efficiency.</p> <p>But GPU Allocation Utilization isn’t just about the GPU-seconds paid for, it’s about the GPU-seconds spent running application code.</p> <p>That’s where the DevOps limits on GPU Allocation Utilization come in. Even in a fully liquid GPU market, there is latency between the time at which a GPU is purchased or rented and the time at which the GPU is running useful work — time to configure operating systems, perform health checks, copy over application code, etc. Absent the ability to precisely predict future demand at timescales greater than that latency, this leads to reduced GPU Allocation Utilization, reduced quality-of-service, or both!</p> <div><p><h3>If allocation is slow, utilization and QoS suffer</h3> <!--[!--><!--]--></p>  <!--[--><!--]--></div> <p>To achieve high GPU Allocation Utilization and meet quality-of-service goals, allocation and spin-up to application code needs to be fast enough to respond to increases in demand.</p> <div><p><h3>With fast, automatic allocation, utilization and QoS can both be high</h3> <!--[!--><!--]--></p>  <!--[--><!--]--></div> <p>This is one of the core problems solved by Modal. We manage a large multi-cloud GPU fleet, benefitting from economies of scale to unlock better engineering solutions and concentration of measure to improve predictability of demand. We <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jJ1GhGkLY0"><!----><!---->built a custom container stack (in Rust btw)<!----></a><!----> to reduce the latency from non-application code and system configuration. And users’ workloads spin up faster because the serverless runtime for that container execution system frames user workloads in terms of application code, not virtual machine maintenance. That allows us to skip the repetitive, undifferentiated work required to create virtual machines. That unlocks novel engineering optimizations for us, like <a href="https://modal.com/blog/mem-snapshots"><!----><!---->memory snapshotting and restoration<!----></a><!---->, and it just-so-happens to make application engineering easier for our users.</p> <h2 id="what-level-of-gpu-allocation-utilization-can-i-expect-to-achieve">What level of GPU Allocation Utilization can I expect to achieve?</h2> <p>The existing numbers are sobering. According to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ai-infrastructure.org/the-state-of-ai-infrastructure-at-scale-2024/"><!----><!---->State of AI Infrastructure at Scale 2024 report<!----></a><!---->, the majority of organizations achieve less than 70% GPU Allocation Utilization <em>when running at peak demand</em> — to say nothing of aggregate utilization.

We <a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/gpu-metrics"><!----><!---->expose it to our users<!----></a><!----> under the name that library uses, “GPU utilization”. Note that this name can be slightly misleading, since this metric does not care whether the code we’re running on the GPU is exercising the hardware’s actual capacity.</p> <p>An application that is achieving low GPU Allocation Utilization is necessarily going to achieve low GPU Kernel Utilization, so long as you consider all GPU-seconds being paid for: a unit not running application code can’t run kernels.</p> <p>Why else might you achieve low GPU Kernel Utilization? In particular, what patterns will show up as low kernel utilization per GPU?</p> <p>First, there might be lots of work to do that supports your application but doesn’t use the GPU, like moving input or output data via network or disk, downloading the many gigabytes of weights of a foundation model, or writing logs.</p> <p>These tasks can be sped up by usual means — judicious application of lazy and eager loading, parallelization, increased bandwidth for non-GPU components like networks, and deleting more code <a rel="nofollow" href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html"><!----><!---->YAGN<!----></a><!---->.</p> <p>Second, the CPU might not be providing work to the GPU quickly enough. A typical GPU-accelerated program is, like a high-performance network application, a dance of concurrency between the CPU executing logic about what work must be done and specialized, but dumb, hardware that can actually do the work. For example, when multiplying two matrices, the popular PyTorch library needs to determine the shapes and types of those two matrices and then lookup the appropriate kernel — somewhat akin to a JIT database query optimizer selecting a physical operator mid-execution. If you are unable to complete this work before the GPU finishes its previous task, the GPU will idle. We’ll call this class of issue “host overhead”.</p> <p>Often, resolving host overhead is a matter of re-writing the host logic — preventing slow host work (like logging in Python) from blocking the host work that drives the GPU. But at the scale of milliseconds per task step, Python starts to become incapable of keeping up, and at the scale of microseconds per task step, the latency required to schedule kernels onto the GPU via <a href="https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/host-software/cuda-runtime-api"><!----><!---->the CUDA C++ APIs and driver<!----></a><!----> begins to bottleneck.</p> <p>In both cases, there are two basic optimizations. First, multiple kernels can be launched at once <a rel="nofollow" href="https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-pytorch-with-cuda-graphs/"><!----><!---->using CUDA Graphs<!----></a><!---->, which essentially convert a sequence of kernel launches into a DAG that only needs to be launched once. Second, the application can aggregate more work for the GPU to complete for a given unit of host work — for example by <a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/dynamic-batching"><!----><!---->batching<!----></a><!----> requests together — to improve utilization with a possible penalty to latency.</p> <p>Code regions with low GPU Kernel Utilization can be identified from application traces, like those produced by the <a href="https://modal.com/docs/examples/torch_profiling"><!----><!---->PyTorch Profiler<!----></a><!---->. Specifically, any period of time where all CUDA streams are empty is a period of zero GPU Kernel Utilization, and so applications with low GPU Kernel Utilization have largely empty CUDA streams in their traces, like the one below. These periods of quiescence need to be correlated to activity on the host to determine which parts of the application code are leading to the bottleneck. GPU application profilers and trace viewers generally support this, e.g. by showing kernel launch dependencies, like the arrow in the trace below.</p> <p><img src="https://modal-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/tmpx_2c9bl5_c5aa7ab0.webp" alt="A trace of a PyTorch application with low GPU Kernel Utilization"> <!--[!--><!--]--><!----></p> <p><modal-img-caption>In traces of GPU applications, periods where no kernels are running appear as empty strips in the timelines of CUDA streams (e.g. Stream 7 7 in the trace above). For details, see <a href="https://modal.com/docs/examples/torch_profiling"><!----><!---->our documentation<!----></a><!---->.</modal-img-caption></p> <h2 id="what-level-of-gpu-kernel-utilization-can-i-hope-to-achieve">What level of GPU Kernel Utilization can I hope to achieve?</h2> <p>GPU Kernel Utilization is the closest metric in this article to the better-known CPU utilization. CPU utilization tracks the fraction of CPU cycles during which instructions were being executed on behalf of your program (as opposed to the CPU idling or running other programs).</p> <p>However, for CPU utilization, hitting 90%+ is often bad, even a trigger for alerts. But we want to and can achieve that level of GPU Kernel Utilization!</p> <p>Fundamentally, this is downstream of the greater predictability of many GPU applications. Running a transactional database replica at 90% CPU utilization baseline risks degraded quality-of-service if query patterns or quantity change. Typical GPU applications have much less variability — for a database analogue, imagine repeatedly running only one basic sequential scan aggregation query, but with slightly different parameters each time — and so have more controllable quality-of-service.</p> <h2 id="what-is-model-flops-utilization-mfu">What is Model FLOP/s Utilization (MFU)?</h2> <h3 id="model-flops-utilization--model-flops-throughput-achieved--flops-bandwidth-paid-for">Model FLOP/s Utilization = Model FLOP/s throughput achieved ÷ FLOP/s bandwidth paid for</h3> <p>At some galaxy-brained, CEO-math level, expenditures on GPUs are really expenditures on floating point operation bandwidth, and so the deepest and most fundamental utilization metric to measure is the ratio of that bandwidth to the throughput achieved.</p> <p>This metric is known as <em>MFU</em>, which either means “Maximum” or “Model” FLOP/s Utilization, depending on who you ask. We go with “Model”, since it’s more common.</p> <p>Instances that aren’t running application code or that aren’t running GPU kernels cannot achieve a high MFU, so low GPU Allocation Utilization or low GPU Kernel Utilization imply low Model FLOP/s Utilization.</p> <p>However, high utilization at these more abstract levels does not imply high MFU.</p> <p>First, as an implementation detail, communication between GPUs is frequently implemented via GPU kernels. This communication, like most communication in distributed systems, is subject to faults (hardware fault, programmer fault, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://slate.com/technology/2014/08/shark-attacks-threaten-google-s-undersea-internet-cables-video.html"><!----><!---->shark attack fault<!----></a><!---->), which frequently manifest as deadlock. From the perspective of GPU Kernel Utilization, a system that is deadlocked in the middle of running a communication kernel is fully utilized (!), but it is completing no useful work. We like to catch this particular issue by monitoring <a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/gpu-metrics"><!----><!---->GPU power draw and heat<!----></a><!---->. More generally, optimizing communication is critical for achieving high MFU, especially for workloads that spread a single task across multiple nodes.</p> <p>Second, floating point computation is just one of the things a GPU must do to complete a task. The most important other task is moving data. Computation can only occur on data stored inside of the <a href="https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/register-file"><!----><!---->register file<!----></a><!----> of the GPU’s <a href="https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor"><!----><!---->streaming multiprocessors<!----></a><!---->, which each store less than a megabyte, while foundation models are measured in gigabytes. The data to which a computation applies must generally be moved from a slower, larger area of the <a href="https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-software/memory-hierarchy"><!----><!---->memory hierarchy<!----></a><!---->. The <a href="https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/gpu-ram"><!----><!---->bandwidth of this memory<!----></a><!----> is generally many times lower than the device’s FLOP/s bandwidth, especially in recent generations. The ratio of an algorithm’s FLOP/s throughput to its byte/s throughput is called the arithmetic intensity.</p> <p>Bottlenecking on memory is a particular challenge in latency-sensitive foundation model inference workloads, where the arithmetic intensity is low (perhaps a few FLOPs per byte). Besides algorithmic rewrites to increase arithmetic intensity, like <a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135"><!----><!---->the online softmax in Flash Attention<!----></a><!---->, the primary generic strategy is <a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/dynamic-batching"><!----><!---->batching<!----></a><!----> more work together, which increases FLOPs executed more than memory bytes moved for most neural network inference workloads, but generally adds per-task latency.</p> <p>Finally, GPU kernels must be carefully written to achieve high MFU. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM"><!----><!---->This public worklog by Si Boehm<!----></a><!----> gives a flavor for the effort required to reach state-of-the-art for a single kernel. Even that worklog stops short of truly maximizing MFU, since it tackles a problem that can’t make use of the fastest elements of contemporary GPUs, the <a href="https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/tensor-core"><!----><!---->Tensor Cores<!----></a><!---->, and writing kernels that can saturate Tensor Cores is even more challenging — see <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cudaforfun.substack.com/p/outperforming-cublas-on-h100-a-worklog"><!----><!---->this worklog from Pranjal Shankhdhar<!----></a><!---->. For this reason, most teams use high-quality open source kernels through libraries like CuBLAS or frameworks like PyTorch and vLLM.</p> <p>The achieved FLOP/s and memory throughput of a GPU application can be monitored using the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/dcgm/latest/user-guide/feature-overview.html#profiling-metrics"><!----><!---->NVIDIA Data Center GPU Management tool<!----></a><!---->, <code>dcgm</code>. The metrics prefixed with <code>DCGM_FI_PROF</code> are generally relevant. In particular, the <code>DCGM_FI_PROF_DRAM_ACTIVE</code> metric measures the utilization of the DRAM-to-SRAM memory bandwidth. The <code>DCGM_FI_PROF_PIPE_TENSOR_ACTIVE</code> metric measures the utilization of the Tensor Cores that provide the maximum FLOP/s bandwidth. This isn’t identical to MFU for subtle reasons covered well in Stas Bekman’s guide <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/stas00/ml-engineering/blob/master/training/performance/README.md#mfu-vs-hfu"><!----><!---->here<!----></a><!---->.</p> <h2 id="what-level-of-model-flops-utilization-can-i-hope-to-achieve">What level of Model FLOP/s Utilization can I hope to achieve?</h2> <p>First, let’s note that measuring Model FLOP/s Utilization is tricky. The theoretical bandwidth can be read from manufacturer datasheets — but watch for asterisks like “with sparsity”. The achieved model throughput, on the other hand, can be hard to measure, in particular since some FLOPs might be spent on other computations, like activation recomputation in training. For that reason, it is often done based on pen-and-paper analysis of the algorithm and with approximate, “napkin” math.</p> <p>The state-of-the-art for MFU in training is achieved by the foundation model teams at leading organizations like OpenAI, Google, and Meta. Of these, Meta is the most open and reports an MFU of 38 - 41% when training <a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21783"><!----><!---->the LLaMA 3 405B model<!----></a><!---->. The more recent DeepSeek-v3 training run by DeepSeek achieved around 20-30% MFU (there’s no official number) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://semianalysis.com/2025/01/31/deepseek-debates/"><!----><!---->using GPUs with tighter communication bottlenecks<!----></a><!---->.</p> <p>Much of the shortfall is due to the need for inter-node communication in large training jobs, which creates bandwidth constraints that aren’t present in inference applications. For inference workloads, MFU might reach higher, closer to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/stas00/ml-engineering/tree/master/compute/accelerator#maximum-achievable-flops"><!----><!---->70% - 80% MFU achieved by raw matrix multiplications<!----></a><!---->, but we aren’t aware of any published results from large-scale deployments. Let us know if we missed them!</p> <p>For context, it’s also helpful to consider the equivalent of MFU for a job running on a CPU. For concreteness, consider the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc"><!----><!---->One Billion Row Challenge<!----></a><!---->, which led teams around the world to competitively optimize a large-scale aggregation problem on CPUs. This problem requires three floating point operations per row on one billion rows, and so has a total FLOP count of 3 billion. The leading results finished in about one second, and so achieved a FLOP/s throughput of about 3 billion. If we assume that the hardware used for the challenge, eight cores out of a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/ax161"><!----><!---->32 core AMD EPYC 7502P<!----></a><!----> machine which can run at 3.35 GHz, is capable of issuing one FLOP per cycle, then the FLOP/s bandwidth is ~26 billion, for an MFU of ~10%. However, that CPU has <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions"><!----><!---->AVX2 SIMD vector instructions<!----></a><!----> with a lane width of 256 and so, assuming it can issue 16 FLOPs/cycle per core, the FLOP/s bandwidth is actually ~420 billion, leading to an MFU of under 1%.</p> <h2 id="how-can-i-improve-my-gpu-utilization">How can I improve my GPU utilization?</h2> <p>If you’re not using <a href="https://modal.com/"><!----><!---->Modal<!----></a><!---->, that’s a great place to start!

<h2 id="the-short-version">The short version</h2>
<p>I've "launched" the <a href="https://macthemes.garden/">Mac Themes Garden</a>! It is a website showcasing more than 3,000 (and counting) Kaleidoscope from the Classic Mac era, ready to be seen, downloaded and explored! Check it out! Oh, and there also is an <a href="https://macthemes.garden/feed.xml">RSS feed</a> you can subscribe to see themes as they are added/updated!</p>
<p>And yes, there is a button that you can include on your website! <a href="https://macthemes.garden/about#buttons">Grab it here</a>! Isn't it cute?</p>

</center>
<p><strong>Now, for the yapping.</strong> Note: if you're reading this in an RSS reader, you might want to open the article on my website directly as it contains a bunch of CSS demos and those won't work well in an RSS reader.</p>
<h2 id="some-background">Some background</h2>
<p>If you know me from Online, you may know that I've been running the Mac Themes Bot on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/macthemes.garden">Bluesky</a>/<a href="https://social.erambert.me/@macthemes">Mastodon</a>/<a href="https://cohost.org/macthemes">Cohost</a> for a few years now.</p>
<p>The idea of the bot was simple, showcasing custom themes from the Mac OS X and Classic Mac eras, on the rate of one an hour. Since I was inspired by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191021204432/https://twitter.com/kaleidoscopemac">@kaleidoscopemac</a> on Twitter, I only started showcasing themes made for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsanity">ShapeShifter by Unsanity</a>. A while later, that Twitter account got suspended.<br>
Since I already had the <a href="https://github.com/eramdam/shapeshifter-themes">tooling in place</a> to scrape and post themes for OS X, I figured I could add themes for Kaleidoscope (OS 7/8/9) into the mix. After trying (and failing) to get the original dataset from the author of the bot, I set on to scrape the Wayback Machine for records of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000823055322fw_/http://www.kaleidoscope.net/schemes/completelisting.shtml">Kaleidoscope Scheme Archive</a>.<br>
From that point on, my bot would post themes every hour, with a classic theme on even hours and an OS X theme on odd hours<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The years passed, the bot carried on, made me and a bunch of other people smile on the various websites where I would run it. The <a href="https://cohost.org/macthemes">Cohost</a> incarnation in particular was really special because Cohost was a special site, but also it was full of nerds (complimentary) and people would go nuts for the random gems in there.</p>
<p>Around maybe early 2023, I grew frustrated of the fact that the only images I had for the Kaleidoscope <s>themes</s> schemes were those <a href="https://github.com/eramdam/shapeshifter-themes/blob/master/assets/!.emperor.gif">tiny .gif files</a> from the late 90s.</p>
<h3 id="recording-25-year-old-schemes">"Recording" 25-year-old schemes</h3>
<p>So I did the reasonable thing: set up a terribly manual process to take screenshots and record the author information of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/kaleidoscope-scheme-archive">~4,000 themes available</a>, with the intention of making a website showcasing everything once I was done.</p>
<p>Without going into details (which you can read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250106111834/https://cohost.org/eramdam/post/5246796-replying-to-this-com">here</a>), the process looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open my Mac OS 9 VM in <a href="https://getutm.app/">UTM.app</a> (QEMU frontend)</li>
<li>Go through the folder of schemes</li>
<li>Select a given scheme, apply it</li>
<li>Take 3 screenshots:
<ol>
<li>One of the scheme's about box.</li>
<li>One of the scheme being used in the Finder/regular desktop situation.</li>
<li>And finally, a screenshot of the application <a href="http://www.shurey.com/Soft/Share/KSA/index.html">KSA Sampler</a> in order to mimic the original screenshots from the Kaleidoscope Scheme Archive. That specific screenshot would get pasted into Photoshop to be cropped/trimmed of its opaque background using Photoshop Actions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Write down the name, author and release year of the scheme</li>
<li>Find the corresponding .sit archive file</li>
<li>Record all of this in a record inside an Airtable database.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's how it looks inside Airtable:</p>
<figure data-type="image"><a href="https://damien.zone/img/blog/airtable-macthemes.png?v=84922ebd65b7"><img src="https://damien.zone/img/blog/airtable-macthemes.png?v=84922ebd65b7" alt="6 rows inside an Airtable database, showing screenshots and scheme information" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></a><figcaption>6 rows inside an Airtable database, showing screenshots and scheme informations</figcaption></figure>
<p>On a good day, I can maybe record, I don't know, a dozen or so themes an hour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Damien, why didn't you automate this process?!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm glad you asked! I tried! But I, at least until now, could not find a good way to reliably perform the actions I need to take. And that's not even touching on the fact that sometimes a scheme doesn't have any author or year information! Sometimes the author inside the Kaleidoscope scheme file is completely wrong, and the actual author is written in a separate "Read me" file. Sometimes there's barely any information to go by, sometimes the scheme is buggy and would crash my VM.</p>
<p>At that point, the only automations I have are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> <a href="https://damien.zone/img/blog/keyboard-mastro-macro.png?v=d9a26f888bf7">macro</a> that calls the <code>qemu-monitor</code> for the running VM, takes a lossless screenshot and puts it into my clipboard, ready to be pasted</li>
<li>Photoshop actions to:
<ul>
<li>create a document from the clipboard</li>
<li>after cropping, remove all pixels of a given color in a document and trim it to remove extra alpha pixels (for the KSA Sampler screenshots above)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/forum/startly-quickeys-5">Quickeys</a> shortcut to call "Hide Others" inside of Mac OS 9. Turns out this action didn't have a keyboard shortcut until Mac OS X? Didn't know that!</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond that, I'm afraid it's all manual since I want to record data that isn't straight forwardly extracted by just looking at files 😔.</p>
<p><em>At any rate</em>, I was and thought "I'll finish recording all these schemes, <strong>and then</strong> I'll make the website"...</p>
<p>Dear reader, I am not done. By my own estimations, I am maybe halfway done. I do not know when I will be fully done, but my good friend <a href="https://wavebeem.com/">Sage</a> pushed me to: make the damn website already.</p>
<p>And they were right, I should have made the website earlier! It was a fun and challenging distraction, and <em>fuck me</em> I could use distractions these days.</p>
<h2 id="making-da-website">Making Da Website</h2>
<p>So, around January of this year, I've started work on the website.</p>
<p>The first step was to interface with the <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a> API in order to download the data from my database and store all the assets into a folder in my repository.
<a href="https://github.com/eramdam/macthemes.garden/blob/main/scripts/airtable.ts">Nothing too crazy</a>, but had to be done.<br>
I did need to be careful around caching and not re-downloading images I already had on disk. We're talking about like, ~2,500 rows each containing 3 images, and you don't want to re-download 7,500 PNG files every time the script needs to run.</p>
<p>With the data on hand, the real fun began.</p>
<figure data-type="image"><a href="https://damien.zone/img/blog/macthemes-garden-v0.png?v=0de864f596fc"><img src="https://damien.zone/img/blog/macthemes-garden-v0.png?v=0de864f596fc" alt="Early version of the Mac Themes Garden site" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></a></figure>
<p>The proof-of-concept was using Eleventy which I chose purely because I had just finished remaking my website (you're reading it now!) using it, so I figured it would be a good fit because of its simplicity and speed.</p>
<p>And it might have been if it wasn't for <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/">WebC</a> being so wonky. You see, I knew I wanted to have multiple OS9-like "windows" in the website's layout. So I figured that, surely, WebC could let me make a "component" and make a UI that way and, I swear to god, I could not make it work that way.<br>
It seems WebC is purely for <strong>W</strong>eb <strong>C</strong>omponents and nothing else, which itself is fine, but that wasn't going to cut it.<br>
I briefly experimented with a <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/liquid/#paired-shortcode">paired short code</a>, but I wasn't going to write HTML inside a JavaScript string. I wanted to have fun on this project.</p>
<h3 id="the-nitty-gritty">The nitty-gritty</h3>
<p>So I switched to <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> whose concept of <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/">components</a> was closer to what I wanted to do here, and I already knew how to use it because <a href="https://erambert.me/">erambert.me</a> uses it.</p>
<p>I will not do a play-by-play of the making of the website, because once the ball was rolling, most of my time was spent playing with UI ideas and using Astro's <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/">content collections</a> such that building the whole website as a bunch of static pages didn't take forever.<br>
Don't get me wrong, Astro is plenty fast as it is, not as fast as Eleventy but still fast!</p>
<p>The "problem" is that I am playing with big numbers. Let's think about them:</p>
<ul>
<li>3,942 themes</li>
<li>868 authors</li>
</ul>
<p>As it is, if we assume one page per scheme and one page per author (which would list all the themes for that author), we arrive at: <strong>3,942 + 868 = 4,810 pages</strong>. Which isn't terrible, but that's already a lot of pages, and we're not doing anything fancy with it.</p>
<p>Let's start being fancy, let's add pagination and let's say we want to show 51 themes per page. Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>T</em> is the number of themes in the set (3,942)</li>
<li><em>A</em> is the number of authors in the set (868)</li>
<li><em>P</em> is the page size (51)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span>const</span> totalPages <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>T</span> <span>*</span> <span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> Math<span>.</span><span>ceil</span><span>(</span><span>T</span> <span>/</span> <span>P</span><span>)</span>
<span>// 4,888 pages</span></code></pre>
<p>That's <strong>4,888 pages</strong>! Except I then wanted to add some fancy things like an authors page <em>(A / 26 (for each letter in the alphabet))</em>, that's another ~33 pages. This gets us close to 5,000 pages. Which is fine, but it means every page better be really quick to generate in order for the build time to not balloon out-of-control.</p>
<p>That's where I had to be careful. I wanted the author pages to show all the themes made by a given author, which I naively implemented like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> getStaticPaths <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> authors <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>getCollection</span><span>(</span><span>"authors"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> authors<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>(</span>a<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
      props<span>:</span> <span>{</span> author<span>:</span> a <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      params<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        author<span>:</span> a<span>.</span>data<span>.</span>slug<span>,</span>
      <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span> satisfies GetStaticPaths<span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> author <span>}</span> <span>=</span> Astro<span>.</span>props<span>;</span>
<span>const</span> themesByAuthor <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>await</span> <span>getCollection</span><span>(</span><span>"themes"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>(</span>t<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> t<span>.</span>data<span>.</span>authors<span>.</span><span>some</span><span>(</span><span>(</span>a<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> a<span>.</span>id <span>===</span> author<span>.</span>id<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Sure, this seems fine as it is. After all, it "only" takes ~30ms to run in development! But running our math from earlier, this will run for every single author page. Suddenly we're looking at:</p>
<p><strong>30ms × 868 = 26,040 ms (26s)</strong> 😱!</p>
<p>After all, we're iterating over the 3,942 schemes 868 times, this isn't great!</p>
<p>What's the fix then?</p>
<p>As it is almost always the case when it comes to performance: doing less work and only doing the hard work once! I took advantage of <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#defining-collection-references">Astro's collection references</a>. I first declare a reference for authors inside my <code>themes</code> schema:</p>
<pre><code>const themes = defineCollection({
<span><span> </span> loader<span>:</span> themesLoader<span>,</span>
<span> </span> schema<span>:</span> z<span>.</span><span>object</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
<span> </span>   name<span>:</span> z<span>.</span><span>string</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
</span><span><span>+</span>   authors<span>:</span> z<span>.</span><span>array</span><span>(</span><span>reference</span><span>(</span><span>"authors"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
</span><span><span> </span>   year<span>:</span> z<span>.</span><span>string</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>optional</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
<span> </span>   mainThumbnail<span>:</span> z<span>.</span><span>string</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
<span> </span>   thumbnails<span>:</span> z<span>.</span><span>array</span><span>(</span>z<span>.</span><span>string</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
<span> </span>   archiveFile<span>:</span> z<span>.</span><span>string</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
<span> </span>   <span>// ...</span>
<span> </span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
</span>});</code></pre>
<p>Which mean that I could simply call the <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/modules/astro-content/#getentries">getEntries</a> method to get the authors of a given theme.</p>
<pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> getStaticPaths <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> authors <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>getCollection</span><span>(</span><span>"authors"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
      props<span>:</span> <span>{</span> author<span>:</span> a <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      params<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        author<span>:</span> a<span>.</span>data<span>.</span>slug<span>,</span>
      <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span> satisfies GetStaticPaths<span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> author <span>}</span> <span>=</span> Astro<span>.</span>props<span>;</span>
<span>const</span> themesByAuthor <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>getEntries</span><span>(</span>author<span>.</span>data<span>.</span>themes<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Which, depending on the number of themes, takes ~10ms <em>at most</em>, for most pages it takes less than 5ms! That is much better.</p>
<p>By applying this technique, I managed to keep the build time of the site under control and Astro builds almost 5,000 pages with various queries between each other in less than 16s!</p>
<figure data-type="image"><a href="https://damien.zone/img/blog/macthemes-build-time.png?v=0cd08b11b896"><img src="https://damien.zone/img/blog/macthemes-build-time.png?v=0cd08b11b896" alt="&quot;Astro's CLI showing it built 4920 pages in 15.54s&quot;" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></a></figure>
<h3 id="getting-cute-with-it">Getting cute with it</h3>
<p>Like mentioned above, I knew I wanted to mimic a Mac OS 9 UI for the website. Now, I <em>could</em> have just used images to make the UI... but where's the fun in that?</p>
<p>So of course I've used every CSS trick in the book to achieve the look. Let me go through some of the pieces of UI and explain how I re-created them.</p>
<h3 id="the-window-frame">The window frame</h3>
<figure data-type="image"><a href="https://damien.zone/img/blog/macthemes-garden-window.png?v=7f1017c11b6d"><img src="https://damien.zone/img/blog/macthemes-garden-window.png?v=7f1017c11b6d" alt="alt text" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></a></figure>
<p>This is, obviously, a big part of the UI, so I wanted to be as close to the actual look of OS 9 as possible. Let's take a simple, empty example:</p>

<p>A lot of the styles involve using multiple box shadows to achieve the "broken border" effects in the different areas of the main UI chrome. Here is the style for the main window body (in white in the preview above):</p>
<pre><code><span>.macos9-window-body</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>border</span><span>:</span> 1px solid <span>var</span><span>(</span>--primary-black<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>box-shadow</span><span>:</span>
    -1px -1px 0 <span>rgb</span><span>(</span>from <span>var</span><span>(</span>--primary-black<span>)</span> r g b / 40%<span>)</span><span>,</span>
    1px 1px 0 <span>var</span><span>(</span>--primary-white<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>--top-left-shadow</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span>--grays-600<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>--bottom-right-shadow</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span>--primary-white<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>box-shadow</span><span>:</span>
    -1px -1px 0 <span>var</span><span>(</span>--top-left-shadow<span>)</span><span>,</span>
    -1px 0px 0 <span>var</span><span>(</span>--top-left-shadow<span>)</span><span>,</span>
    0 -1px 0 <span>var</span><span>(</span>--top-left-shadow<span>)</span><span>,</span>
    1px 1px 0 <span>var</span><span>(</span>--bottom-right-shadow<span>)</span><span>,</span>
    1px 0 0 <span>var</span><span>(</span>--bottom-right-shadow<span>)</span><span>,</span>
    0 1px 0 <span>var</span><span>(</span>--bottom-right-shadow<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>background-color</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span>--primary-white<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h3 id="the-title-bar">The title bar</h3>
<p>That part was fun, there's a lot going on so let's take a look step by step. Here's how it looks and the HTML markup:</p>

<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>macos9-window-titlebar<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>span</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>filler<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The "stripes" pattern is done using a repeating CSS gradient and two pseudo-elements on each side with a slightly different gradient:</p>
<pre><code><span>.macos9-window-titlebar &gt; span.filler</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>flex</span><span>:</span> 1<span>;</span>

  <span>position</span><span>:</span> relative<span>;</span>

    <span>display</span><span>:</span> block<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>We then have the window buttons which are...you guessed it, a lot of box-shadows and borders put together:</p>

<pre><code><span>.macos9-window-titlebar &gt; button</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Oh, and there is also a neat trick: I'm using <code>:has()</code> to sometimes re-align the title so it's actually visually centered when there is an uneven number of buttons on each side:</p>
<pre><code><span>.macos9-window-titlebar:has(.button.close, .button.zoom, .button.close)
.button.close + .filler</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>padding-left</span><span>:</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span>13px + <span>var</span><span>(</span>--macos9-window-titlebar-gap<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h3 id="buttons">Buttons</h3>
<p>This is the part of the design that made me question my sanity and my commitment to the bit. Let's take a look at a simple button:</p>

<p>Looks simple enough, right? Well. How do you preserve the pixelated look in CSS without using images? Why, you go insane and draw the pixels yourself using CSS Grid areas of course! This was a <a href="https://codepen.io/wavebeem/pen/VYYLqJv?editors=1100">suggestion</a> from <a href="https://wavebeem.com/">Sage</a>.</p>
<p>This requires some planning because CSS Grid areas have to be rectangular. That's when I went to Photoshop and drew a bunch of colored rectangles for each area with unique colors:</p>
<figure data-type="image"><a href="https://damien.zone/img/blog/macthemes-button-grid.png?v=36032ebdbd92"><img src="https://damien.zone/img/blog/macthemes-button-grid.png?v=36032ebdbd92" alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></a></figure>
<p>That's 38 areas for the inner/outer shadows to cover, as well as 4 areas for the plain background! It's easy enough to just generate that using JSX, we take care to add a <code>data-n</code> attribute which will help us target the areas in CSS:</p>

<p>Then, we have to use Sass to create the necessary selectors:</p>
<pre><code><span>@use</span> <span>"sass:math"</span><span>;</span>

<span>@for</span> <span>$i</span> <span>from</span> 1 <span>through</span> <span>38 </span><span>{</span>

    <span><span>$n</span></span><span>:</span> <span>"0#{$n}"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>.shadow[data-n="<span>#{$n}</span>"] </span><span>{</span>
    <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> s<span>#{$n}</span><span>;</span>

<h3 id="open-graph-images">Open Graph images</h3>
<p>I could have taken the easy route when making the open graph images for each theme and simply dropped a PNG of the main window, something like this:</p>
<picture>
  <source srcset="https://damien.zone/img/blog/macthemes-embed-v1-dark.png?v=e52e251e312a" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" type="image/png">

</picture>
<p>This is very cute in apps like Discord, but looks terrible about everywhere else because of the wrong aspect ratio and the non-support of alpha channels.</p>
<picture>
  <source srcset="https://damien.zone/img/blog/macthemes-embed-v1-bsky-dark.png?v=b4ccfc724027" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" type="image/png">

<p>So I took another approach:</p>
<figure data-type="image"><a href="https://macthemes.garden/themes-opengraph/13d46b4752aa-Monkey-Paradise.png"><img src="https://macthemes.garden/themes-opengraph/13d46b4752aa-Monkey-Paradise.png" alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></a></figure>
<p>But, obviously, doing that kind of compositing manually would be a terrible idea, and I'm not good enough with ImageMagick, so I ended up using Vercel's <a href="https://github.com/vercel/satori">satori</a> to lay the two images out and generate an image for every single theme:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>type</span> <span>{</span> InferEntrySchema <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"astro:content"</span><span>;</span>

<p>I then put together a <a href="https://github.com/eramdam/macthemes.garden/blob/7a8983b64114d6305eb906169aaf64b6005321a5/scripts/opengraph-images.ts">script</a> to process all the images by spawning multiple process, the whole script takes ~2min30 to run on my M1 Max Mac Studio and generate ~3900 images.</p>
<p>As a bonus, these images will also be used by the Mac Themes Bot when available going forward.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What's next</h2>
<p>I don't know how long it will take, but I want to continue/finish "recording" the schemes I have access to. Hopefully I am done before next year lolsob. You should subscribe to the <a href="https://macthemes.garden/feed.xml">RSS feed</a> to see those as I update them!</p>
<p>Apart from that, I have a bunch of ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>a "search by color" feature</li>
<li>a way to see/showcase the custom icons contained in each scheme when applicable. There are some gems in there, trust me!</li>
<li>Somehow, find a way to hook the site into <a href="https://infinitemac.org/">InfiniteMac</a> to quickly view a scheme "live"</li>
<li>a user-submitted gallery of old Macs running the schemes from the site. Hit me up if this is something you'd want to participate in :)</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all, folks, have a good life.<br>

Typically, the majority will have this diagnosis for the rest of their lives,” Kilgard said. “In this case, we had 100% loss of diagnosis. It’s very promising.”</p><p>Prolonged exposure therapy — a component of traditional PTSD treatment — is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy, conducted in a safe and supportive environment, that involves individuals gradually confronting thoughts, memories and situations they have avoided since experiencing a trauma.</p><p>In the study, scientists paired this therapy with concurrent delivery of short bursts of stimulation of the vagus nerve via a small device implanted in a participant’s neck.</p><p>After a standard 12-session therapy course, assessments were performed four times during the six months after its conclusion. Benefits persisted during that time for all nine participants.</p><p>The study is the largest clinical trial to date using an implanted device for the treatment of PTSD, Kilgard said.</p><p>Pioneering work by TxBDC researchers has demonstrated previously that VNS paired with physical rehabilitation can accelerate neuroplasticity — the rewiring of areas of the brain.</p><p>Their 13-year effort to treat a wide variety of conditions using VNS has resulted in approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating impaired upper-limb movement in stroke patients.</p><p>“The common theme in our VNS work is that we’re taking therapies that show potential, like prolonged exposure therapy for PTSD, and making them work better,” he said.</p><p>The National Center for PTSD, part of the Department of Veterans Affairs, estimates that 5% of adults in the U.S. have post-traumatic stress disorder in any given year, and that women are twice as likely to develop PTSD at some point in their life.</p><p>Many PTSD patients fail to respond to therapy or pharmacological intervention, or experience intolerable side effects or relapse, leaving them with no viable prospect for remission.</p><p>Kilgard said that PTSD patients are not only found among military veterans, but also among average citizens who have faced traumatic events.</p><p>“When you hear PTSD, you may picture a combat zone, but it’s much more prevalent than that,” he said.</p><p>“It can stem from any event that inspires fear of death or bodily injury, or death of a loved one.”</p><p>Co-corresponding author Dr. Seth Hays, associate professor of bioengineering in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science and director of preclinical research at the TxBDC, has been a part of the VNS project since its earliest studies.</p><p>“It’s been an incredibly rewarding experience to see this technology evolve from early discovery experiments in the lab to clinical benefits in patients,” Hays said. “This whole process truly highlights the value of team-based science.”</p><p>More than a decade ago, Dr. Robert Rennaker, professor of neuroscience and the Texas Instruments Distinguished Chair in Bioengineering, began to design an innovative implantable VNS device that was much smaller and less expensive than devices already on the market. The most recent wireless version of the device is about the size of a dime.</p><p>“The technology we have is above and beyond anything else that’s out there. The device is about 50 times smaller than our version from just three years ago,” he said.</p><p>“The 49 people in the Dallas area with our devices have a combined 100 years of experience with it implanted. There have been no issues; the devices are all still functioning. And they don’t interfere with typical medical care; you can have an MRI, a CT scan or an ultrasound.”</p><p>The next step in the PTSD research — a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 pilot study — is ongoing in Dallas and Austin.</p><p>“We hope that it will represent another step toward FDA approval of a treatment that doesn’t exist now, and it would be invented, tested and delivered by UT Dallas, as was the case for upper-limb recovery after stroke,” Kilgard said.</p><p>Licensed clinical psychologist Dr. Mark Powers, a research center director of the Trauma Research Center at BSWRI, is the lead and co-corresponding author of the study.</p><p>Driven by his desire to improve quality of life among people who experience psychological trauma, Powers said that VNS has “changed the game” by improving both treatment efficacy and its tolerability.</p><p>“VNS has changed my work dramatically,” he said.</p><p>“Our gold-standard treatments for PTSD have about an 85% response rate, with 40% no longer having their diagnosis, and a 20% dropout rate. Soon we could have the option of VNS for people who don’t get better with cognitive behavioral therapy alone.”</p><p>Powers added that his collaboration with UTD has a multidisciplinary synergy that he regards as rare.</p><p>“With this alliance, we have people doing the preclinical and the clinical work at the same time, giving each other feedback and ideas,” he said. “Neither one of our groups could do this alone.”</p><p>Other UTD-affiliated study authors included Dr. Jane Wigginton, medical director and co-director of the UT Dallas Clinical and Translational Research Center; Amy Porter MBA’20, TxBDC director of operations; and Holle Carey Gallaway MBA’23, TxBDC research biomedical engineer.</p><p>Researchers from Southern Methodist University, UT Austin and Baylor Scott &amp; White Health also contributed to the study.</p><p><strong>Funding: </strong>The research was funded by a grant (N66001-15-2-4057) from the Biological Technologies Office at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, part of the Department of Defense.</p><h2>About this PTSD and brain stimulation research news</h2><p><strong>Author: </strong><a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d5a6adb3e4e2e4e4e6e595a0a1b1b4b9b9b4a6fbb0b1a0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Fontenot</a><br><strong>Source: </strong><a href="https://utdallas.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UT Dallas</a><br><strong>Contact: </strong>Stephen Fontenot – UT Dallas<br><strong>Image: </strong>The image is credited to Neuroscience News</p><p><strong>Original Research: </strong>Open access.<br>“<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brs.2025.03.007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vagus nerve stimulation therapy for treatment-resistant PTSD</a>” by Michael Kilgard et al. <em>Brain Stimulation</em></p><hr><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p><strong>Vagus nerve stimulation therapy for treatment-resistant PTSD</strong></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common and debilitating, and many individuals do not respond to existing therapies. We developed a fundamentally novel neuromodulation-based therapy for treatment-resistant PTSD.</p><p>This approach is premised on coupling prolonged exposure therapy, a first-line evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy that directs changes within fear networks, with concurrent delivery of short bursts of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), which enhance synaptic plasticity.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>We performed a first-in-human prospective open-label early feasibility study (EFS) using a next-generation miniaturized system to deliver VNS therapy in nine individuals with moderate to severe treatment-resistant PTSD. All individuals received a standard 12-session course of prolonged exposure therapy combined with VNS.</p><p>Assessments were performed before, 1 week after, and 1, 3, and 6 months after the completion of therapy.&nbsp;ClinicalTrials.gov&nbsp;registration: NCT04064762.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>VNS therapy resulted in significant, clinically-meaningful improvements in multiple metrics of PTSD symptoms and severity compared to baseline (CAPS-5, PCL-5, and HADS all p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001 after therapy). These benefits persisted at 6 months after the cessation of therapy, suggesting lasting improvements.</p><p>All participants showed loss of PTSD diagnosis after completing treatment. No serious or unexpected device-related adverse events were observed.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>These findings provide a demonstration of the safety and feasibility of VNS therapy for PTSD and highlight the potential of this approach. Collectively, these support the validation of VNS therapy for PTSD in a rigorous randomized controlled trial.</p> <!-- Form created by Optin Forms plugin by WPKube: create beautiful optin forms with ease! --> <!-- https://wpkube.com/ --><!--optinforms-form5-container--> <!-- / Optin Forms --> </div><!-- .entry-content --><!-- .entry-footer --></article><!-- #post-x --></main><!-- .site-main --></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/en-us/three-chapters-at-cloudflare-programmer-to-cto-to-board-of-directors/">https://blog.cloudflare.com/en-us/three-chapters-at-cloudflare-programmer-to-cto-to-board-of-directors/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43918600">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>2025-03-27</p><section><p>4 min read</p><img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3WjSvoGBEfq01eYJ0hrlVH/dfd40ec4bea05d31c9030c9ce2284d75/unnamed__1_.png" alt=""><div><p>Today, after more than 13 years at the company, I am joining Cloudflare’s board of directors and retiring from my full-time position as CTO. </p><p>Back in 2012 I wrote a short post on my personal site simply titled: <a href="https://blog.jgc.org/2012/02/programmer.html"><u>Programmer</u></a>. The post announced that I’d recently joined a company called CloudFlare (still sporting that capital “F”) with the job title Programmer. I’d chosen that title in part because it was the very first title I’d ever had, and because it would reflect what I’d be doing at Cloudflare.</p><p>I had spent a lot of time working at startups—in technical and then management roles—and wanted to go back to the really technical part that I loved most. Cloudflare gave me that opportunity, and I worked on a lot of systems that make up the Cloudflare that so many people around the world use today.</p><p>Looking back on my time at the company it’s really, really hard to pick my top highlights. In 2019 <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/helping-to-build-cloudflare-part-1/"><u>I wrote 6,000 words on the experience of helping build Cloudflare</u></a>. But here are five that stand out:</p>
          <p>
            <h3 id="always-be-shipping">Always be shipping</h3>
            
          </p>
        <p>The night we finished the preparation to launch <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/"><u>Universal SSL</u></a> sticks in my memory. We set out to offer the Industry's First Universal SSL for free, effectively doubling the size of the encrypted web overnight, a big deal in 2014. I remember Cloudflare’s third co-founder, Lee Holloway, hunched over his laptop finishing the code. The team has been working on it all weekend, and late that Sunday night Lee announced “it’s done.”&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <h3 id="handling-adversity">Handling adversity</h3>
            
          </p>
        <p>It’s easy to pick moments of great success or when things went really well and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/helping-to-build-cloudflare-part-2/"><u>Cloudbleed in 2017</u></a> may not seem like a special moment, but it helped show who we were. It showed how a team could come together under intense stress, and how we could set the standard going forward for how companies disclose and talk about security problems. I personally discovered that a Google Meet call can be kept running for 24 hours and sleeping in two hour chunks is possible.</p>
          <p>
            <h3 id="being-international-and-intentional">Being international and intentional</h3>
            
          </p>
        <p>Originally from the UK, I was the first team member located outside the United States. I got to help build the largest offices outside the US: first, Cloudflare’s London office and then Cloudflare’s <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-lisbon-office/"><u>Lisbon office</u></a>. These two offices are a big part of who we are today, with Lisbon being our European HQ.</p><p>When COVID halted our in-office work, I was blown away by the response from the team. As we all individually faced different difficulties because of the pandemic we continued to work together to ensure that the Internet, on which everyone was relying while confined at home, worked reliably and securely.</p>
          <p>
            <h3 id="truly-impactful-technology">Truly impactful technology</h3>
            
          </p>
        <p>Picking a favourite product would be a bit like asking someone to choose their favourite child, but I have soft spots for Cloudflare’s WAF, DNS, and DDoS solutions because I personally worked on those systems. And I still feel I need to apologize to the WAF team who took over my code and had to face that one Perl script that shall not be named!</p><p>Beyond the products there’s something much deeper: Cloudflare’s mission to help build a better Internet. I’ve been very proud of how we have supported and advanced the Internet itself through our work on the latest standards and protocols. And I’m even prouder of the role we’ve played through Project Galileo, The Athenian Project, and Cloudflare for Campaigns.</p>
          <p>
            <h3 id="the-people">The people</h3>
            
          </p>
        <p>Every week Cloudflare holds an all-hands company meeting which ends with “Shoutouts,” a chance to recognize members of the team who have gone above and beyond. Curiosity and empathy are two core values at Cloudflare, and I am struck every week by how often we’re recognizing teams of people who are being thanked for helping with a sale, fixing a bug, responding to an incident, or helping build Cloudflare. That team spirit is part of what makes Cloudflare a special place to work.</p><p>One of the things I will miss about not being at Cloudflare day-to-day is the incredible strength of the individual team members. I’ve been learning from them for 13 years straight!</p>

          </p>
        <p>When I joined the company the team was a lot smaller! We were 25 people and now, we’ve grown to more than 4,200 employees and 15 locations across the globe. As we grew I wore a lot of different hats. For a time I ran engineering, operations, security, and even IT. And, of course, I wrote for, and edited, the Cloudflare Blog for many, many years. Over time, we hired many great leaders to run those teams.</p><p>But the role that persisted was CTO. And today, we are announcing that, just as I gave up the title Programmer (and the programming that went along with it), I am giving up the title CTO (and the role’s responsibilities) for a new way to help Cloudflare grow and succeed, as a member of the board of directors.</p><p>Last year when I told Matthew that I planned to retire, I had not expected to be offered a seat on the company’s board. It’s an incredible and rare honour to go from being an employee of the company (albeit one who has been there from close to the beginning) to joining the board of directors. I am absolutely thrilled to be able to continue helping Cloudflare grow and succeed from a slightly different vantage point.</p><p>At the same time, Dane Knecht, who, until today, was SVP of Emerging Technology and Incubation, has become our CTO. Dane joined just a few months after me, and is uniquely positioned and experienced to take the CTO role. We’ve worked so closely for the last 13 years as peers, that in many meetings it would’ve been hard to distinguish our roles. I’m pretty sure that Dane bleeds Cloudflare orange, and I’ve never seen him wear a T-shirt that doesn’t say Cloudflare on it. He has been part of nearly every major milestone here at Cloudflare. He cares so deeply about the company, and its success; he will make a great CTO.</p><p>My plan isn’t to go off and work somewhere else, or start a new company. I intend to remain closely involved with Cloudflare in my role on the board. I am incredibly honoured, and grateful to have been part of Cloudflare’s incredible growth and success, and I am looking forward to helping the company continue its growth.</p><p>One area I’m particularly interested in assisting with is the company’s work across the product suite on AI. Back in 2002 (23 years ago! gulp!). I wrote a very popular open source machine learning (didn’t call it AI back then) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POPFile"><u>email filtering program</u></a> and in 2004 worked on how to deal with what happens when <a href="https://blog.jgc.org/2023/07/how-to-beat-adaptivebayesian-spam.html"><u>one AI system is used to attack another</u></a>. At Cloudflare, we’ve used learning techniques to enhance security, block bots, and predict how our systems should behave and grow. There’s much more to do.</p><p>Just as co-founder <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/author/michelle-zatlyn/"><u>Michelle</u></a> likes to say: we’re just getting started. And so am I.</p></div></section><div><p>Cloudflare's connectivity cloud protects <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/" rel="noreferrer">entire corporate networks</a>, helps customers build <a target="_blank" href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/" rel="noreferrer">Internet-scale applications efficiently</a>, accelerates any <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/performance/accelerate-internet-applications/" rel="noreferrer">website or Internet application</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/" rel="noreferrer">wards off DDoS attacks</a>, keeps <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-security/" rel="noreferrer">hackers at bay</a>, and can help you on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/" rel="noreferrer">your journey to Zero Trust</a>.</p><p>Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://one.one.one.one/" rel="noreferrer">1.1.1.1</a> from any device to get started with our free app that makes your Internet faster and safer.</p><p>To learn more about our mission to help build a better Internet, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/what-is-cloudflare/" rel="noreferrer">start here</a>.
