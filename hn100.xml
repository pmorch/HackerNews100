<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This is a long post telling my experiences. Sorry for the length, couldn't make it any shorter.</em></p>

<p>Hello everybody. My name is Ed and I'm the developer of <a href="https://edgrace.itch.io/idletale">IdleTale</a>.</p>

<p>I started this project because I love incremental and RPG games, and I wanted to create something that I would really love to play myself, and idle RPGs are not something too common. So I did it out of pure passion.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1dedf6k/incremental_rpg_game_im_working_on/">made this first post</a> a few months ago when the game was just an idea. It received so much support that I decided to keep going and turn it into something a bit more serious. Nothing lucrative or anything (actually the game is free and it was never intended to be paid nor have in-app purchases / ads), just something for the fans of incremental and RPG games, like me. A game made by and for RPG/idle games lovers.</p>

<p>So I decided to launch it on Google Play since that platform can help reach a bigger audience than just promoting it yourself, and people are more comfortable downloading apps from Google Play than downloading random .apks from other sites which may contain malware.</p>

<p>In June (2 months ago) I created my Google Play dev account and offered a total of 200 (the maximum Google Play allows you to) spots for alpha testing to my community. We filled the list and more than 100 people kept playing the game for more than those 2 weeks required for the app to be approved for production. The alpha testing ended up being slightly more than 1 month long.</p>

<p>For this whole month of alpha testing, over 50 versions were built and (not sure about the exact numbers) around 20-30 were uploaded to Google Play. Meanwhile, in the internal testing track, over 50 versions were pushed for me and my close friends to keep testing new features before adding them to the alpha testing or the official release.</p>

<p>No problems were found. Everything went well and the alpha testing period ended on July 19th of this year (last month).</p>

<p>I kept pushing versions on a daily basis to the internal testing for no more than 4 friends + myself, and kept testing everything. Some days I would even upload 2-3 versions that day.</p>

<p>The app was ready to be launched and I announced its launch for August 20th, 3 days ago.</p>

<p>I published the app. Around 1K downloads were made within the first 24 hours.</p>

<p>I then made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1ex2xpy/comment/ljjnvqz/?context=3">this post</a>, which as of today has been edited removing the Google Play links and changing them for different ones since the Google Play app is no longer available.</p>

<p>Everyone was happy and I was proud of the game. A free idle game with no ads, no in-app purchases and no P2W. No possibility to spend any money nor have nasty ads 24/7. After all, I did it because I loved it.</p>

<p>The next morning I woke up with a mail from Google. The app had been deleted due to "Malware or Deceptive Behavior". How could it be? I had already stated everything the app did in my Privacy Policy, and after starting an antivirus scan, no malware was found in my PC.</p>

<p>So I appealed it. Within a few minutes I received a mail stating that the decision would be upholded and the app would not come back.</p>

<p>I was really confused. What kind of deceptive behavior could it have?</p>

<p>After reviewing my code over and over, thousands of lines of it, I found a single line of code that could've been the cause of the problem.</p>

<p>Someone on Discord requested the game to keep the phone's screen always on while the game was active. They even attached a link of someone sharing their piece of code with that function included. It was an Unity integrated (I build in Unity) function:</p>

<p><code>Screen.SleepTimeout = SleepTimeout.NeverSleep();</code></p>

<p>I really liked the idea because if my players wanted it, I couldn't see any reason to not give it to them.</p>

<p>That was the only function I used that would not request the user's consent to make changes in the device's settings. It only worked while the game was active, but it's enough to break Google Play's policies.</p>

<p>I didn't know that this would be a problem or break Google Play's policies. I didn't even know this actually changed the phone's settings, but I'll take the blame for not reading further into this function and knowing this could be a problem.</p>

<p>The thing is, the version that was marked as "Deceptive Behavior" was not the live one, it was the one I sent for revision to hotfix a bug. And they didn't "refuse" it, they completely deleted the app, not only the "under revision" build.</p>

<p>So I re-appealed stating that I'm now aware of what I did wrong and that I'm willing to take that piece of code out because it's not my intention to modify anyone's settings without their consent. The same answer was given within a few minutes.</p>

<p>But in their initial mail they stated that, if I sent a new version compliant with their terms, they could re-enable the app. But I couldn't send any new revisions since my app got completely deleted, my Google Play Console's panel was totally inaccesible.</p>

<p>So I thought the way (and what they meant by sending a new version) was creating a new app and re-send it for revision, starting the same process of 2 weeks with 20 or more testers over again. But I wouldn't mind, I just wanted my game to be out there and share it with everyone.</p>

<p>I didn't even have time to upload the new version when I received another mail from Google. I had just put the name to the new app and I was doing the ESRB rating survey when I received it.</p>

<p>Not only my app, but my whole dev account was completely closed FOREVER, and any attempt at creating any new account would result in closure as well. I lost the opportunity to publish anything in Google Play for my whole life as a game or app developer.</p>

<p>And it started with a function of keeping the screen turned on while the game was open. I really feel like a fool for not thinking this could be a problem.</p>

<p>My guess is that they deleted the account because I broke another rule: uploading a rejected app twice.</p>

<p>I know this now because I read almost all the policy after having my account closed to see what I could've done wrong, but I didn't know I would break a rule by uploading a compliant version of a rejected app when they asked me to do so in order to save my app.</p>

<p>With all this story I want to share my pain with anyone that has had a similar problem, and remember that sometimes a little misstep followed by lack of knowledge can turn a little problem into a really big one.</p>

<p>I am no one to judge whether this is fair or not, but I definitely feel terribly bad for having lost something that not only made me really happy and feel fullfilled, but also gave me hope to create a good game everyone could enjoy.</p>

<p>Thank you if you've read this far and sorry again for the long post.</p>

<p>Edit: And sorry if this sounds too intense, it's just frustrating that this happened after investing a lot of time, money and hopes in something that would end up like this 24 hours after its launch.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

1.1.1.1) from the original import that created OpenBSD on Oct 18,
1995.  With this commit, we have completed an amusing mission of
replacing the final parts of the original OpenBSD.

We have reached OpenBSD of Theseus.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Surreal Engine</h2><a id="user-content-surreal-engine" aria-label="Permalink: Surreal Engine" href="#surreal-engine"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The goal of this project is to reimplement enough of the original Unreal Engine to make the Unreal Tournament (UT99) maps playable.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5136903/125014285-afc65580-e06d-11eb-80c0-0a1992a7d0ff.jpg"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5136903/125014285-afc65580-e06d-11eb-80c0-0a1992a7d0ff.jpg" alt="facingworlds"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Current status</h2><a id="user-content-current-status" aria-label="Permalink: Current status" href="#current-status"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The engine can load and render the maps. The Unrealscript VM is almost feature complete - only arrays and network conditional execution are not implemented yet.</p>
<p dir="auto">It will attempt to load all level actors and initialize the map. However, while the menus and the HUD will appear, there are still many native functions not implemented yet. It is also quite possible some events aren't firing as they should. You will therefore see exceptions shown if you interact with them and that is where the project is at.</p>
<p dir="auto">At the time of this writing, SurrealEngine can detect the following UE1 games:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Unreal Tournament (v436, v451b, v469(a, b, c, d))</li>
<li>Unreal (v200, v209, v220, v224v, v225f, v226f)</li>
<li>Unreal Gold (v226b, v227(i, j, k_11))</li>
<li>Deus Ex (v1002f, v1112fm)</li>
<li>Klingon Honor Guard (219)</li>
<li>NERF Arena Blast (v300)</li>
<li>TNN Outdoors Pro Hunter (v200)</li>
<li>Rune Classic (v1.10)</li>
<li>Clive Barker's Undying (v420)</li>
<li>Tactical-Ops: Assault on Terror (v3.4.0 and v3.5.0 - both running under UT436 and UT469 engines)</li>
<li>Wheel of Time (v333)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">From the list above, only Unreal Tournament v436 and Unreal Gold v226 is in a relatively playable state. Running any other game (and UT versions) can and will result in crashes.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Unreal Tournament v436</h3><a id="user-content-unreal-tournament-v436" aria-label="Permalink: Unreal Tournament v436" href="#unreal-tournament-v436"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The game launches, menu options will work and botmatches can be played, however the bots will barely have any AI (they move around sometimes and retaliate upon being attacked), and some maps will have some functionality missing (like DM-Morpheus will not have the "X leading the match" screens work).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Unreal Gold v226</h3><a id="user-content-unreal-gold-v226" aria-label="Permalink: Unreal Gold v226" href="#unreal-gold-v226"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The game launches, menu options will work most of the time. Single player maps can be played, as well as botmatches. The AI will behave more or less the same as how they behave in UT. Objects from Return to Na Pali have their models appear broken.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Deus Ex v1112fm</h3><a id="user-content-deus-ex-v1112fm" aria-label="Permalink: Deus Ex v1112fm" href="#deus-ex-v1112fm"></a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You probably haven’t heard of cardiologist Don Poldermans, but experts who study scientific misconduct believe that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryhusten/2014/01/15/medicine-or-mass-murder-guideline-based-on-discredited-research-may-have-caused-800000-deaths-in-europe-over-the-last-5-years/">thousands of people may be dead</a> because of him. </p><p>Poldermans was a prolific medical researcher at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands, where he analyzed the standards of care for cardiac surgery, publishing a series of definitive studies from 1999 until the early 2010s.</p><p>One crucial question he studied: Should you give patients a beta blocker, which lowers blood pressure, before certain heart surgeries? Poldermans’s research said yes. European medical guidelines (and to a lesser extent US guidelines) <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20068416/">recommended it accordingly</a>. </p><div><p>The problem? Poldermans’s data <a href="https://cardiobrief.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/integrity-report-2012-10-english-translation.pdf">was reportedly fake</a>. A <a href="https://cardiobrief.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/integrity-report-2012-10-english-translation.pdf">2012 inquiry by Erasmus Medical School, his employer, into allegations of misconduct</a> found that he “used patient data without written permission, used fictitious data and… submitted to conferences [reports] which included knowingly unreliable data.” Poldermans <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2011/11/17/breaking-news-prolific-dutch-heart-researcher-fired-over-misconduct-concerns/">admitted the allegations and apologized</a>, while stressing that the use of fictitious data was accidental. </p></div><div><p>Sign up <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup">here</a> to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.</p></div><p>After the revelations, a new meta-analysis was published in 2014, evaluating whether to use beta blockers before cardiac surgery. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3932762/">It found</a> that a course of beta blockers made it 27 percent more likely that someone would die within 30 days of their heart surgery. That is, the policy which Poldermans had recommended using falsified data, adopted in Europe on the basis of his research, was actually dramatically increasing the odds people would die in heart surgery. </p><p><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/17525-heart-surgery">Tens of millions</a> of heart surgeries were conducted across the US and Europe during the years from 2009 to 2013 when those misguided guidelines were in place. One provocative analysis from cardiologists Graham Cole and Darrel Francis estimated that there were <a href="https://drmalcolmkendrick.org/tag/don-poldermans/">800,000 deaths</a> compared to if the best practices had been established five years sooner. While that exact number is hotly contested, a 27 percent increase in mortality for a common procedure for years on end can add up to an extraordinary death toll. </p><p>I learned about the Poldermans case when I reached out to some scientific misconduct researchers, asking them a provocative question: Should scientific fraud be prosecuted? </p><p>Unfortunately, fraud and misconduct in the scientific community isn’t nearly as rare as one might like to believe. We also know that the consequences of being caught are frequently underwhelming. It can take years to get a bad paper retracted, even if the flaws are readily apparent. Sometimes, scientists alleged to have falsified their data <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24107889/francesca-gino-lawsuit-harvard-dishonesty-researcher-academic-fraud">file frivolous lawsuits</a> against their peers who point it out, further silencing anyone who would speak out about bad data. And we know that this behavior can have high stakes, and can dramatically <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22776428/ivermectin-science-publication-research-fraud">affect treatment options for patients</a>. </p><p>In cases where research dishonesty is literally killing people, shouldn’t it be appropriate to resort to the criminal justice system?</p><div><p id="the-question-of-whether-research-fraud-should-be-a-crime"><h2>The question of whether research fraud should be a crime</h2></p></div><p>In some cases, research misconduct may be hard to distinguish from carelessness. </p><p>If a researcher fails to apply the appropriate statistical correction for multiple hypothesis testing, they will probably get some spurious results. In some cases, researchers are heavily incentivized to be careless in these ways by an academic culture that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12016710/science-challeges-research-funding-peer-review-process">puts non-null results above all else</a> (that is, rewarding researchers for finding an effect even if it is not a methodologically sound one, while being unwilling to publish sound research if it finds no effect). </p><p>But I’d argue it’s a bad idea to prosecute such behavior. It would produce a serious chilling effect on research, and likely make the scientific process slower and more legalistic — which also results in more deaths that could be avoided if science moved more freely. </p><p>So the conversation about whether to criminalize research fraud tends to focus on the most clear-cut cases: intentional falsification of data. Elisabeth Bik, a scientific researcher who studies fraud, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01363-z">made a name for herself</a> by demonstrating that photographs of test results in many medical journals were <a href="https://www.vox.com/unexplainable/23945153/how-to-catch-a-scientific-fraud">clearly altered</a>. That’s not the kind of thing that can be an innocent mistake, so it represents something of a baseline for how often manipulated data is published.</p><p>While technically some scientific fraud could fall under existing statutes that prohibit lying on, say, a grant application, in practice scientific fraud is more or less never prosecuted. Poldermans eventually lost his job in 2011, but most of his papers weren’t even retracted, and he faced no further consequences. </p><p>But in response to growing awareness of fraud’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/09/scientific-misconduct-retraction-watch">frequency</a> and its harms, some scientists and scientific-fraud watchdogs have <a href="https://chris-said.io/2024/06/17/the-case-for-criminalizing-scientific-misconduct/">proposed changing that</a>. A new statute, narrowly tailored to scientific fakery, could make it clearer where to draw the line between carelessness and fraud. </p><p>The question is whether legal consequences would actually help with our fraud problem. I asked Bik what she thought about proposals to criminalize the misconduct that she studied. </p><p>Her reaction was that, while it’s not clear whether criminalization is the right approach, people should understand that currently there are almost no consequences for wrongdoers. “It’s maddening when you see people cheat,” she told me, “And even if it involves grant money from the NIH, there’s very little punishment. Even with people who have been caught cheating, the punishment is super light. You are not eligible to apply for new grants for the next year or sometimes three years. It’s very rare that people lose jobs over it.”</p><p>Why is that? Fundamentally, it’s a problem of incentives. It is embarrassing for institutions when one of their researchers commits misconduct, so they’d rather impose a mild penalty and not keep digging. There’s little incentive for anyone to get to the bottom of misconduct. “If the most serious consequence for speeding was a police officer saying ‘Don’t do that again,’ everyone would be speeding,” Bik told me. “This is the situation we have in science. Do whatever you want. If you get caught, it’ll take years to investigate.” </p><p>In some ways, a legal statute isn’t the ideal solution. Courts are also guilty of taking years to deliver justice in complex cases. They also aren’t well suited to answering detailed scientific questions, and would almost certainly be relying on scientific institutions that conduct investigations — so what really matters is those institutions, not whether they’re attached to a court, a nonprofit, or to the NIH.</p><p>But in sufficiently severe cases of misconduct, it does seem to me that it’d be a major advantage to have an institution outside academia at work on getting to the bottom of these cases. If well designed, a statute that allowed prosecution for scientific fraud could shift the overwhelming incentives to let misconduct go unpunished and move on. </p><p>If there were ongoing investigations conducted by an outside agency (like a prosecutor), it would no longer be easiest for institutions to maintain their reputation by sweeping incidents of fraud under the rug. But the outside agency would not actually have to be a prosecutor; an independent scientific review board would probably also suffice, Bik said. </p><p>Ultimately, prosecution is a blunt tool. It might help provide accountability in cases where no one is incentivized to provide it — and I do think in cases of misconduct that lead to thousands of deaths, it would be a matter of justice. But it’s neither the only way to solve our fraud problem nor necessarily the best one. </p><p>So far, however, efforts to build institutions within the scientific community that police misconduct have had only limited success. At this point, I’d consider it a positive if there were efforts to allow external institutions to police misconduct as well.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Nanolog is an extremely performant nanosecond scale logging system for C++ that exposes a simple printf-like API and achieves over 80 <em>million</em> logs/second at a median latency of just over <em>7 nanoseconds</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">How it achieves this insane performance is by extracting static log information at compile-time, only logging the dynamic components in runtime hotpath, and deferring formatting to an offline process. This basically shifts work out of the runtime and into the compilation and post-execution phases.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prerequisites</h2><a id="user-content-prerequisites" aria-label="Permalink: Prerequisites" href="#prerequisites"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Currently NanoLog only works for Linux-based systems and depends on the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>C++17 Compiler: <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/" rel="nofollow">GNU g++ 7.5.0</a> or newer</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/" rel="nofollow">GNU Make 4.0</a> or greater</li>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/" rel="nofollow">Python 3.4.2</a> or greater</li>
<li>POSIX AIO and Threads (usually installed with Linux)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">NanoLog Pipeline</h2><a id="user-content-nanolog-pipeline" aria-label="Permalink: NanoLog Pipeline" href="#nanolog-pipeline"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The NanoLog system enables low latency logging by deduplicating static log metadata and outputting the dynamic log data in a binary format. This means that log files produced by NanoLog are in binary and must be passed through a separate decompression program to produce the full, human readable ASCII log.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compiling NanoLog</h2><a id="user-content-compiling-nanolog" aria-label="Permalink: Compiling NanoLog" href="#compiling-nanolog"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are two versions of NanoLog (Preprocessor version and C++17 version) and you must chose <strong>one</strong> to use with your application as they’re not interoperable. The biggest difference between the two is that the Preprocessor version requires one to integrate a Python script in their build chain while the C++17 version is closer to a regular library (simply build and link against it). The benefit of using the Preprocessor version is that it performs more work at compile-time, resulting in a slightly more optimized runtime.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you don’t know which one to use, go with C++17 NanoLog as it’s easier to use.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">C++17 NanoLog</h3><a id="user-content-c17-nanolog" aria-label="Permalink: C++17 NanoLog" href="#c17-nanolog"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The C++17 version of NanoLog works like a traditional library; just <a href="https://github.com/PlatformLab/NanoLog/blob/master/runtime/NanoLogCpp17.h"><code>#include "NanoLogCpp17.h"</code></a> and link against the NanoLog library. A sample application can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/PlatformLab/NanoLog/blob/master/sample">sample directory</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To build the C++17 NanoLog Runtime library, go in the <a href="https://github.com/PlatformLab/NanoLog/blob/master/runtime">runtime directory</a> and invoke <code>make</code>. This will produce <code>./libNanoLog.a</code> to against link your application and a <code>./decompressor</code> application that can be used to re-inflate the binary logs.</p>
<p dir="auto">When you compile your application, be sure to include the NanoLog header directory (<a href="https://github.com/PlatformLab/NanoLog/blob/master/runtime"><code>-I ./runtime</code></a>), link against NanoLog, pthreads, and POSIX AIO (<code>-L ./runtime/ -lNanoLog -lrt -pthread</code>), and enable format checking in the compiler (e.g. passing in <code>-Werror=format</code> as a compilation flag). The latter step is incredibly important as format errors may silently corrupt the log file at runtime. Sample g++ invocations can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/PlatformLab/NanoLog/blob/master/sample/GNUmakefile">sample GNUmakefile</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">After you compile and run the application, the log file generated can then be passed to the <code>./decompressor</code> application to generate the full human-readable log file (instructions below).</p>

<p dir="auto">The Preprocessor version of NanoLog requires a tighter integration with the user build chain and is only for advanced/extreme users.</p>
<p dir="auto">It <em>requires</em> the user's GNUmakefile to include the <a href="https://github.com/PlatformLab/NanoLog/blob/master/NanoLogMakeFrag">NanoLogMakeFrag</a>, declare USR_SRCS and USR_OBJS variables to list all app’s source and object files respectively, and use the pre-defined <code>run-cxx</code> macro to compile <em>ALL</em> the user .cc files into .o files instead of <code>g++</code>. See the <a href="https://github.com/PlatformLab/NanoLog/blob/master/sample_preprocessor/GNUmakefile">preprocessor sample GNUmakefile</a> for more details.</p>
<p dir="auto">Internally, the <code>run-cxx</code> invocation will run a Python script over the source files and generate library code that is <em>specific</em> to each compilation of the user application. In other words, the compilation builds a version of the NanoLog library that is <strong>non-portable, even between compilations of the same application</strong> and each <code>make</code> invocation rebuilds this library.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, the compilation should also generate a <code>./decompressor</code> executable in the app directory and this can be used to reconstitute the full human-readable log file (instructions below).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Sample Applications</h2><a id="user-content-sample-applications" aria-label="Permalink: Sample Applications" href="#sample-applications"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The sample applications are intended as a guide for how users are to interface with the NanoLog library. Users can modify these applications to test NanoLog's various API and functionality. The C++17 and Preprocessor versions of these applications reside in <a href="https://github.com/PlatformLab/NanoLog/blob/master/sample">./sample</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PlatformLab/NanoLog/blob/master/sample_preprocessor">./sample_preprocessor</a> respectively. One can modify <code>main.cc</code> in each directory, build/run the application, and execute the decompressor to examine the results.</p>
<p dir="auto">Below is an example for C++17 NanoLog's <a href="https://github.com/PlatformLab/NanoLog/blob/master/sample">sample application</a>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cd sample

# Modify the application
nano main.cc

make clean-all
make
./sampleApplication
./decompressor decompress /tmp/logFile"><pre><span>cd</span> sample

<span><span>#</span> Modify the application</span>
nano main.cc

make clean-all
make
./sampleApplication
./decompressor decompress /tmp/logFile</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note: The sample application sets the log file to <code>/tmp/logFile</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">NanoLog API</h2><a id="user-content-nanolog-api" aria-label="Permalink: NanoLog API" href="#nanolog-api"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To use the NanoLog system in the code, one just has to include the NanoLog header (either <a href="https://github.com/PlatformLab/NanoLog/blob/master/runtime/NanoLogCpp17.h">NanoLogCpp17.h</a> for C++17 NanoLog or <a href="https://github.com/PlatformLab/NanoLog/blob/master/runtime/NanoLog.h">NanoLog.h</a> for Preprocessor NanoLog) and invoke the <code>NANO_LOG()</code> function in a similar fashion to printf, with the exception of a log level before it. Example below:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="#include &quot;NanoLogCpp17.h&quot;
using namespace NanoLog::LogLevels;

int main() 
{
  NANO_LOG(NOTICE, &quot;Hello World! This is an integer %d and a double %lf\r\n&quot;, 1, 2.0);
  return 0;
}"><pre>#<span>include</span> <span><span>"</span>NanoLogCpp17.h<span>"</span></span>
<span>using</span> <span>namespace</span> <span>NanoLog</span>::LogLevels<span>;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() 
{
  <span>NANO_LOG</span>(NOTICE, <span><span>"</span>Hello World! This is an integer %d and a double %lf<span>\r\n</span><span>"</span></span>, <span>1</span>, <span>2.0</span>);
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Valid log levels are DEBUG, NOTICE, WARNING, and ERROR and the logging level can be set via <code>NanoLog::setLogLevel(...)</code></p>
<p dir="auto">The rest of the NanoLog API is documented in the <a href="https://github.com/PlatformLab/NanoLog/blob/master/runtime/NanoLog.h">NanoLog.h</a> header file.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Post-Execution Log Decompressor</h2><a id="user-content-post-execution-log-decompressor" aria-label="Permalink: Post-Execution Log Decompressor" href="#post-execution-log-decompressor"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The execution of the user application should generate a compressed, binary log file (default locations: ./compressedLog or /tmp/logFile). To make the log file human-readable, simply invoke the <code>decompressor</code> application with the log file.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="./decompressor decompress ./compressedLog"><pre><code>./decompressor decompress ./compressedLog
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">After building the NanoLog library, the decompressor executable can be found in either the <a href="https://github.com/PlatformLab/NanoLog/blob/master/runtime">./runtime directory</a> (for C++17 NanoLog) or the user app directory (for Preprocessor NanoLog).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Unit Tests</h2><a id="user-content-unit-tests" aria-label="Permalink: Unit Tests" href="#unit-tests"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The NanoLog project contains a plethora of tests to ensure correctness. Below is a description of each and how to access/build/execute them.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Integration Tests</h4><a id="user-content-integration-tests" aria-label="Permalink: Integration Tests" href="#integration-tests"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The integration tests build and test the Nanolog system end-to-end. For both C++17 NanoLog and Preprocessor NanoLog, it compiles a client application with the NanoLog library, executes the application, and runs the resulting log file through the decompressor. It additionally compares the output of the decompressor to ensure that the log contents match the expected result.</p>
<p dir="auto">One can execute these tests with the following commands:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cd integrationTest
./run.sh"><pre><span>cd</span> integrationTest
./run.sh</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Preprocessor and Library Unit Tests</h4><a id="user-content-preprocessor-and-library-unit-tests" aria-label="Permalink: Preprocessor and Library Unit Tests" href="#preprocessor-and-library-unit-tests"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The NanoLog Library and Preprocessor engine also contain a suit of their own unit tests. These will test the inner-workings of each component by invoking individual functions and checking their returns match the expected results.</p>
<p dir="auto">To run the NanoLog preprocessor unit tests, execute the following commands:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cd preprocessor
python UnitTests.py"><pre><span>cd</span> preprocessor
python UnitTests.py</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To build and run the NanoLog library unit tests, execute the following commands:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git submodule update --init

cd runtime
make clean

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        
            <p><span>I</span> remember the day when, at the age of 7, I realized that I wanted to figure out how reality worked. My mother and father had just taken us shopping at a market in Calcutta. On the way back home, we passed through a dimly lit arcade where a sidewalk bookseller was displaying his collection of slim volumes. I spotted an enigmatic cover with a man looking through a microscope; the words “Famous Scientists” were emblazoned on it, and when I asked my parents to get it for me, they agreed. As I read the chapters, I learned about discoveries by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek of the world of microscopic life, by Marie Curie about radioactivity, by Albert Einstein about relativity, and I thought, “My God, I could do this, too!” By the time I was 8, I was convinced that everything could be explained, and that I, personally, was going to do it.</p><p>Decades have passed, and I am now a theoretical physicist. My job is to work out how all of reality works, and I take that mission seriously, working on subjects ranging from the quantum theory of gravity to theoretical neuroscience. But I must confess to an increasing sense of uncertainty, even bafflement. I am no longer sure that working out what is “real” is possible, or that the reality that my 7-year-old self conceived of even exists, rather than being simply unknown. Perhaps reality is genuinely unknowable: Things exist and there is a truth about them, but we have no way of finding it out. Or perhaps the things we call “real” are called into being by their descriptions but do not independently exist.</p>
      
    <blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The theories and concepts we build are like ladders we use to reach the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote><p>I am steeped in the cultural traditions of physics, a field that is my calling and trade, and in the philosophies of India with which I was raised. As a physicist, I remain committed to a system of thought which posits that: (1) things we observe are definitely real, (2) the details may be unknown, (3) bounded resources may slow progress, but (4) physical inquiry can lead us to the real truth, as long as we have time and proceed with patience. On the other hand, I am also acutely aware of philosophical traditions to the effect that: (1) there may be a reality, but (2) measurements from the world are inherently misleading and partial, so that (3) the real may be formally indescribable, and that (4) we may not have a systematic way to reach the fundamentally real and true.</p>
          <p>The idea that the real may be unknowable is very old. Consider the creation hymn in the <em>Rig Veda</em>, composed around 1500 to 1000 B.C., called the “Nasadiya Sukta.” This verse addresses fundamental questions of cosmology and the origin of the universe. In a beautiful translation by Juan Mascaró, it asks:&nbsp;</p><p>Who knows the truth? Who can tell whence and how arose this universe? The gods are later than its beginning: Who therefore knows whence comes this creation? Only he who sees in the highest heaven: He only knows whence came this universe and whether it was made or un-created. He only knows, or perhaps he knows not.</p><p>The poet who wrote this verse points out the fundamental problem of epistemology: We don’t know some things and may not even have any way of determining what we don’t know. Some questions may be intrinsically unanswerable. Or the answers may be contradictory. The “Isha Upanishad,” a Sanskrit text from the first millennium B.C., attempts to describe a reality that escapes common sense: “It moves and it moves not, it is far and it is near, it is inside and it is outside.”</p><p>A second problem is that perception fundamentally limits our ability to apprehend reality. A prosaic example is the perception of color. Eagles, turtles, bees, and shrimp sense more and different colors than we humans do; in effect, they see different worlds. Different perceptual realities can create different cognitive or conceptual realities.</p>
          <p>Jorge Luis Borges pushed this idea to the limit in his story “Funes the Memorious,” about a man who acquires a sort of infinite perceptual capacity. Borges writes: “A circle drawn on a blackboard, a right triangle … are forms that we can fully grasp; … [Funes] could do the same with the stormy mane of a pony … with the changing fire and its innumerable ashes.” Funes’ superpower sounds wondrous, but there is a catch. Borges writes that Funes was “almost incapable of ideas of a general, Platonic sort. Not only was it difficult for him to comprehend that the generic symbol <em>dog</em> embraces so many unlike individuals of diverse size and form; it bothered him that the dog … (seen from the side) should have the same name as the dog … (seen from the front).” The precision of Funes’ perception of reality prevents him from thinking in the coarse-grained categories that we associate with thought and cognition—categories which, necessarily rough, texture our imagined reality.</p><p>The arbitrariness of categories was the subject of another Borges story, “The Analytical Language of John Wilkins,” in which Wilkins imagined dividing animals into those belonging to the Emperor, those that are crazy-acting, those painted with the finest brush made of camel hair, those which have just broken a vase, those that from a long way off look like flies, and other oddly specific groupings.</p><figure><img width="800" height="699" alt="In Body Image" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Balasu_BREAKER.png?auto=compress&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=png&amp;h=895&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Balasu_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1600 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Balasu_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Balasu_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"><figcaption><strong>SKETCHY:</strong> Students and the public are often told the world consists of real particles called quarks and leptons. Yet these are only concepts that approximate a certain sketch of the structure of the world. <em>Image by Fouad A. Saad / Shutterstock.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The philosopher Michel Foucault, in his book <em>The Order of Things</em>, drew inspiration from Borges’ stories to reflect on the nature of categorization. He suggested that the categories and concepts that we define control our bounded cognition and, in their intrinsic arbitrariness, structure the realities that reside in our minds.</p>
          <p>Foucault’s analysis resonates with me because it reminds me of categories in physics. For example, we routinely tell our students and the public that the world consists of particles called quarks and leptons, along with subatomic force fields. Yet these are concepts that reify a certain approximate sketch of the structure of the world. Physicists once thought that these categories were fundamental and real, but we now understand them as necessarily inexact because they ignore the finer details that our instruments have just not been able to measure.</p><p>If our categories determine the reality we perceive, can having an idea call a reality into being? This question is a version of the “simulation hypothesis,” whereby all of reality as we know it is simply a simulation in some computational engine, or perhaps a version of the idealism of Plato, where things that we can conceive in the world echo imperfectly an ideal that is the true reality.</p><p>Consider, for example, Mymosh the Self-begotten, the tragic hero of a story by Polish writer, <a href="https://nautil.us/the-book-no-one-read-235082/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stanislaw Lem</a>, in his volume <em>The Cyberiad</em>. Mymosh, a sentient machine self-organized by accident from a cosmic garbage heap, conjures up entire worlds and peoples just by imagining them. Are those people real, or are they all in his head? In fact, is there a difference? After all, Mymosh’s imagination is a physical process—electrical impulses in his brain. So perhaps the people he imagines are real in some sense.</p><blockquote>
<p>Things exist and there is a truth about them, but we have no way of finding it out.</p>
</blockquote>
          <p>Some of these philosophical conundrums have concrete avatars in theoretical physics. Consider the notion of “duality” between physical theories. In this context, a “theory” means a mathematical description of a hypothetical universe, which we develop as a stepping-stone to understanding the actual universe in which we live. Two theories are said to be “dual,” or equivalent, if every observable in one matches some observable in the other. In other words, the two theories are different representations of the same physical system. Often in these dualities the elementary variables, or particles, of one theory become the collective variables, or lumps of particles, of the other, and vice versa. Dual theories scramble some of the most basic categories in physics, such as the difference between “bosonic” particles (any number of which can be in the same place at the same time) and “fermionic” particles (no two of which can be in the same place at the same time). These two kinds of particles have entirely different physical properties, so you would think that they could not be equivalent. But through dualities, it turns out that lumps of bosons can act like fermions, and vice versa. So, what’s the reality here?</p><p>Even more dramatic are dualities involving the force of gravity. On one side, we have theories of matter and all the forces except gravity; on the other, we have theories of matter and forces including gravity. These theories look very different. They are couched in terms of different forms of matter, different types of forces, and even different numbers of spacetime dimensions. Yet they describe precisely the same fundamental physics. So, what is “real” here? If one theory says the force of gravity operates and the other says it doesn’t, what do we conclude about the reality of gravity? Perhaps we can use my sketch to visualize the situation—we are able to tell stories about the corners of this diagram of possible worlds, where simplifications and approximations suffice, but the categories and concepts that we have been capable of, at least to date, fail to describe the interior where reality is actually located.</p><figure><img width="800" height="513" alt="In Body Image" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Balasu_BREAKER-2.png?auto=compress&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=png&amp;h=657&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Balasu_BREAKER-2.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1600 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Balasu_BREAKER-2.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Balasu_BREAKER-2.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"><figcaption><em>Sketch by Vijay Balasubramanian</em></figcaption></figure><p>Quantum mechanics makes things even more confusing. Quantum-mechanical states of a system can be combined, or superposed, in seemingly contradictory ways. So, the spin of an electron can be in a superposition of pointing up and down—an idea that might seem akin to suggesting that, say, <a href="https://nautil.us/how-einstein-and-schrdinger-conspired-to-kill-a-cat-236140/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a cat can be in a superposition </a>of alive and dead. Does that mean these objects are in both states or neither state? Some theories suggest that measuring a cat (to continue with this metaphor) could cause it to collapse into a state of aliveness or deadness; others, evoking something like the many-worlds theory, suggest that the combined superposition continues through time. This is a <em>casse-tête</em>, a head breaker.</p>
          <p>Where does this leave me? Perhaps we can reconcile all these ideas by following Ludwig Wittgenstein, who proposed in his <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em>, possibly referencing previous ideas of Søren Kierkegaard, that the theories and concepts we build are like ladders or nets we use to reach the truth, but we must throw them away upon getting there. I myself am trying to find my way by working in multiple fields, both physics and <a href="https://nautil.us/neuroscience-weighs-in-on-physics-biggest-questions-238326/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neuroscience</a>, studying both the world and the mind that perceives it, because I believe that the quest to understand the reality of the universe must contend with the truncations imposed by the perceptual and cognitive limitations of the mind.</p><p>Should we bother seeking truths about the world in light of the doubts I have set out? I am hardly the first to ask. Socrates, according to Plato, remarked to Meno: “I would contend … that we will be better [people], braver and less idle, if we believe that one must search for the things one does not know, rather than if we believe that it is not possible to find out what we do not know and that we must not look for it.”</p><p>I am with Socrates on this one—his attitude is wise and pragmatic. If there is a reality and a truth about it, we will be better off and more likely to find it by searching, rather than assuming that it is not there. And even if the search, and the ladders we use to climb obstacles, do not lead us to the truth, we will enjoy the journey.&nbsp; <img decoding="async" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""></p><p><em>Lead image by Tasnuva Elahi; with photos by Vijay Balasubramanian</em></p>

<p dir="auto">Surfer is a digital footprint exporter, designed to aggregate all your personal data from various online platforms into a single folder.</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, your personal data is scattered across hundreds of platforms and the companies operating these platforms have no incentive to give this data back to you. Surfer solves this problem by navigating to websites and scraping data from these websites.</p>
<p dir="auto">We believe that personal data aggregation is the key to enabling truly useful, universal personal assistants.</p>

<li>Click on "Export" to initiate the data extraction process.</li>
<li>The app waits for the target page to load completely.</li>
<li>The system checks if the user is signed in to the platform being scraped.</li>
<li>If not signed in, the user is prompted to sign in.</li>
<li>If signed in, the process continues.</li>
<li>Once signed in, the app interacts with the platform's user interface.</li>
<li>The app then scrapes the user's data from the platform.</li>
<li>Finally, the extracted data is exported and saved to your local storage.</li>
