<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>There is something wrong at Booking.com.</p><p>While its parent company has been making record profits – $1.3bn for the second quarter of 2023 alone – and its CEO and executives have been cashing in millions of dollars in shares this year, many of the people who helped Booking.com make that fortune claim to have not been paid since July, some say longer.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/01/booking-com-hotel-fees-unpaid-millions-technical-issue" data-link-name="in body link">Many Booking.com accommodation partners</a> from Australia to Europe to the Americas have faced silence from the company as they’ve chased payments for months while struggling to keep businesses afloat – particularly during the lucrative northern hemisphere peak summer season, when many guests were essentially staying free of charge, as Booking.com hadn’t passed on payments.</p><p>You don’t need me to tell you the full impact of this. You only have to read the comments posted on social media and websites referencing the holiday booking site.</p><figure id="63eff0d6-94db-4348-81dc-1c05e51fb270" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:4,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/01/booking-com-hotel-fees-unpaid-millions-technical-issue&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Travel website Booking.com leaves hoteliers thousands of dollars out of pocket&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;63eff0d6-94db-4348-81dc-1c05e51fb270&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:1,&quot;design&quot;:8}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>One of the most distressing stories is beneath a post about Booking.com’s investment in AI and cutting-edge technology by the company’s highly remunerated CEO, Glenn Fogel, on his LinkedIn page.</p><p>Many partners have complained directly to the CEO about Booking.com’s silence on late payments and staff’s lack of response to calls, emails and cases opened on the platform that are closed without being resolved.</p><p>“I am a widow raising a child on my own,” reads one post by a woman I have since confirmed is called Claudia Arnull. “Because l have not been paid properly since the end of June my credit history is ruined and all my savings have gone and l am now in so much debt there is nothing left to use. As of this moment all l have to feed my child is porridge.”</p><p>The post appears genuine – and is genuinely heartbreaking – and you would hope that it will be investigated by the company. After all, nobody knows exactly how many families have been left in similar positions, with stress over credit histories and depleted savings due to Booking.com’s inability to pay partners.</p><p>We know that it’s likely that hundreds or thousands of partners have been affected. It could be many many more. We can’t know for sure, because despite dozens of emails to Booking.com’s media relations and Booking Holding’s communications departments, questions as to how many partners were affected, were never answered.</p><p>The only Booking.com spokesperson to respond to me, from their UK press office, emailed a standard reply. The official response blames payment issues on a technical glitch resulting from a planned two-week July maintenance intended to secure and enhance the travel reservations platform.<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/01/booking-com-hotel-fees-unpaid-millions-technical-issue" data-link-name="in body link"> A similar statement was given to the Guardian</a> this week in which it said it understood “the frustration of the accommodation hosts and owners” and that the “system errors that affected the payments have now been corrected”.</p><p>A Booking.com market manager in south-east Asia admitted at a recent industry event that payment delays were caused by the installation of a new payment system. Staff salaries were also affected, she said, explaining it as a risk they had to take.</p><p>It’s hard for partners to get excited about new initiatives when Booking.com hasn’t paid them in months, which means they can’t pay staff or utilities, get laundry done, buy ingredients for guest breakfasts or pay loans or investors and have to borrow from family and friends.</p><p>I’ve heard scores of heartbreaking stories in Facebook groups and online forums in recent months as I’ve connected with other accommodation partners and affiliate partners like myself to share experiences and tips to getting paid. My own three-month-long journey in chasing payments only ended last week after a partner shared direct emails for Booking.com finance department heads. I was paid three days later without an explanation or an apology.</p><p>Booking.com has 90 million accommodation partners with lodgings listed on their platform. It’s worth noting that it’s not the big brand hotels or luxury resorts that have been affected – they take payments from guests and send commissions to Booking.com. It appears to be couples, families and individuals; the independent operators of smaller lodgings that might not have a credit card facility to accept payments, such as apartment rentals, cottages, villas, bed and breakfasts and rooms in homes. A British owner of one such property says she is owed £2,500 (A$4,759).</p><figure id="1abf59a7-750d-46d9-9cec-09e44764b6d6" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:15,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/14/how-can-we-prove-our-bookingcom-accommodation-didnt-exist&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Fake or not fake?

Why no proper explanation as to why this continues to not be resolved? Why aren’t we getting an apology from the board?”</p><p>One partner, who rents out an apartment in the Canary Islands, described finally making headway in her months-long fight to get paid. On Sunday, she says, she received notice that June-September payments of €13,000 (A$21,458) would be paid in November. But why should she wait another month when Booking’s finance team can make manual payments in a few days?</p><p>Booking.com partners aren’t alone in their battle for payments, responses and explanations. On consumer site TrustPilot, Booking.com has a “bad” one-star rating (out of five stars) from 48,872 reviewers. They complain about appalling customer service, staff who don’t appear to read emails or follow up and refunds promised but allegedly not paid.</p><p>Of course, none of these complaints are new – it’s just these problems have never appeared to have been as widespread.</p><p>It’s time that Booking.com directed some of those billions in profits and so-called cutting-edge technology to fixing the long-term payment problems and communication issues. Glenn Fogel needs to explain what’s been going on and he needs to apologise.</p><p>Regulators around the globe need to hold the company to account, to immediately put pressure on the company to pay up now and pay on time and legislate for greater transparency and accountability. Booking.com shouldn’t be able to continue to reap wealth from partners struggling to keep their accommodation open because the world’s No 1 travel site hasn’t paid them their earnings.</p><ul>

<p><span>Canalys EMEA Forum 2023</span> Lenovo is forecasting that the vast majority of its devices will be repairable by 2025 – as will the repair parts themselves – but it is not intending to specify where customers should have their kit fixed.</p>
<p>Talking on stage at the Canalys EMEA Forum 2023, Luca Rossi, senior vice resident at Lenovo and president of its Intelligent Devices Group, said the company has committed to a net zero emission policy by 2050, and analyzing the components used in its hardware is part of the equation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/22/new_eu_right_to_repair/"><span>READ MORE</span></a></p></div>
<p>"On repairability, we have a plan that by 2025 more than 80 percent of the repair parts will be repaired again so that they they enter into the circular economy to reduce the impact to the environment."</p>
<p>He added: "More than 80 percent of our devices will be able to be repaired at the customer, by the customer or by the channel and we are enabling this with a design for serviceability kind of approach."</p>
<p>This means that "batteries, SSD, many things, will not any longer be sealed into the product but will be available for the customer to be to repaired on site and then save a lot of waste."</p>

    

<p>The world's largest PC maker doesn't have a terrible reputation in terms of the ease at which its gadgets can be mended, unlike Apple. The ThinkPad T14 Gen 3, for example, was assigned a fixability score of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ifixit.com/repairability/laptop-scores">7 out of 10</a> by Fixit; and the Framework 13 got top marks.</p>

        


        

<p>Lenovo and other vendors aren't going to make hardware easier to fix out of the goodness of their own hearts: the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/21/right_to_repair/">European Council last month started to update EU rules</a> to ensure consumers are better informed about the lifespan and repairability of the tech devices they buy. The requirements should be finalized before June next year.</p>

<p>Similar right to repair movements are also happening stateside, including in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/13/apple_california_right_repair/">California</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/30/new_york_repair_bill/">New York</a>.</p>
<p>Yet won't easing repairability hit Lenovo in the pocket as consumers and businesses, in theory at least, get a simpler solution to keep their devices running for longer? Canalys CEO Steve Brazier put this question to Rossi on stage.</p>
<p>"I think you cannot you cannot look at this in this way," he said, adding the future looks very rosy for tech companies. "There are so many opportunities that frankly thinking I'm not worried that we will damage our business by doing what is right for the planet. Not at all." ®</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/">https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37778531">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
   <!-- ParagraphBodyStart --><div>
   <p><img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/AB12_15_05copy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">This is my street-legal jet car on full afterburner.  The car has two engines: the production gasoline engine in the front driving the front wheels and the jet engine in the back.  The idea is that you drive around legally on the gasoline engine and when you want to have some fun, you spin up the jet and get on the burner (you can start the jet while driving along on the gasoline engine).  The car was built because I wanted the wildest street-legal ride possible.  With this project, I was able to use some stuff I learned while getting my fancy engineering degree (I have a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University) to design a street-legal jet car without the distraction of how other people have done it in the past - because no one has.  I don't know how fast the car will go and probably never will.  The car was built to thrill me, not kill me.  That doesn't stop me from the occasional blast on the highway though.
   </span></p><p>
   <img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_Rear_Pa1_PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">The car is licensed here in California.  In California, new cars have bi-annual smog inspections so if you modify the engine, it is likely to fail the inspection and you won't be able to drive it on the street.  There are some exempt engine modifications (ex. after-cat mufflers - big deal) but none that will allow you to add 1350 hp to a new car.
   </span>
   <img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_Side1_PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">Car was built to look as if VW delivered the car this way.  It handles fine and is safe.  I was thinking of putting it into an import car show but the promoter told me that it looked too plain and recommended that I put some decals on it, lower it, and put on some aftermarket wheels.  Sure kid, put on some flimsy wheels won't take a curb and don't center on the hubs, lower the car so the tires rub and get cut by the body using springs that bounce me all over the road, and advertise for companies that couldn't engineer themselves out of a paper bag.  I would have thought the 14" diameter tailpipe was enough for him but I guess it wasn't.  Response from the hot rod magazines has been slow.  One editor told me that is because I didn't use anything they advertise.  But the response to driving it on the street and going to the hot rod shows (San Francisco Custom Car Show, Grand National Roadster Show in Pomona, and the Detroit Autorama) has been fantastic.  This car attracts crowds better than any '32 Ford, '69 Camaro, or decaled Honda.
   </span>
   <img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_Rear_Dr1_PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">The Beetle was chosen because it looks cool with the jet and it shows it off well.  Remember the Hurst wheelstanding Barracuda "Hemi Under Glass"?  Well, this is "Jet Under Glass".  Air for the jet enters the car through the two side windows and the sunroof.  It's a little windy inside but not unbearable.
   </span>
   <img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_Rear_Dr_Open1_PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">The production hatch release switch on the driver's door activates two new latches (one on each side) and the hatch pops open just like a production car.  The "hatch not closed" warning light works too.
   </span>
   <img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_Rear_Open1_PScopy.jpg" width="600" height="800"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">Here you can see the split in the tailpipe after a particularily rude burner pop.  All fixed and reinforced now.  The heat blanket keeps the plastic bumper from melting when the jet is operating.
   </span><img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_BackDash1_PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">The back of the gauge panel was kept open to give the car a techie look.  Something to talk about.  The car's an engineering device, let's see some engineering thingies.  The aluminum panel was designed in SolidWorks and cut out of billet, bead blasted, clear annodized, and then the labels for the switches were milled into the front using a font matching the VW cluster.  Little details like the holes having flat sides so the switches don't spin and exactly matching the contour of the dash added time to the project.  Several versions were made out of styrofoam first to get the layout and lighting right.  From the back, the panel reminds me of the 1970s McLaren CanAm cars.
   </span><img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_Back_Pa_Window1_PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">The first thing I did when I got the car was to cut the hole in the back for the engine.  Made a fancy jig out of a tripod, a rod, and a lawnmower wheel to mark out the cut and went at it with a pneumatic saw.  Then finished it off with jeweler's files.  No paint required.  Didn't even chip.  The hole was tricky because it goes through 3 layers (bumper and two layers of metal) and it's a circle projected onto angled surfaces.   Just finding the centerline of the car wasn't trivial.  Worrying what my neighbors would say if I ruined the back of a brand-new car made me REAL careful.  I believe the hole is within 2 mm.
   </span><img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_Dash_Pa1_PScopy.jpg" width="600" height="800"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">There are three gauges for the jet: %RPM, Oil Pressure, and Turbine Inlet Temperature.  The most important is turbine inlet temperature.  If you exceed about 650 degrees C for very long, you damage the engine.  This is critical on start-up.  You don't want a "hot-start".  The throttle for the jet engine is located next to the gear selector.  It is a lever and has three buttons: Cool, Big-Fire, and Afterburner.  "Cool" leans out the engine and is used to lower the turbine inlet temperature if you get a hot-start.  To light big-fire or the afterburner, you hold a button down and 1/2 second later, press the hot-streak button on the floor.  Then things happen!  Notice the kerosene level gauge in front of the gear selector (jet fuel is mostly kerosene) and the bud vase missing a rose.  Where did it go?
   </span></p></div>
<div><p>
<img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_FUBB_PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">Lotsa stuff back here.  The force from the jet is tied to the vehicle through sandwich plates inside the car bolted to contoured aluminum billets that were slid into the frame rails.  You can see the billet on the left side with a hole in its center, welded to the plate with 4 bolts.  Used helium as the inert gas and a lot of current to weld that chunk of aluminum.  To return the car to its production height, adjustable spring perches were used.  Same spring rate, just corrected the ride height.  Drives and handles fine.  Kerosene is stored in a custom 14 gallon, baffled, foam-filled kevlar fuel cell in the spare tire well.  Two fuel exits in the back: a -12 on the left side and a -10 on the right.  The -10 goes to a shutoff, then a Barry Grant pump (one of the few hot rod parts on the car), then up into the car where it sees a filter, a regulator, and an electrical shutoff valve before feeding the engine.  The -12 goes into a shutoff, then a 1.5 hp, 11,000 rpm, 24V custom electric pump.   Pump is magnesium and can maintain 100 psi at 550 gph.  From the pump it goes into the car to a filter, then a large regulator, and then to the afterburner solenoid and the big-fire solenoid (to left of pump and feeding bottom of tailpipe through orange covered hose).  Fuel system was tested for flow capability.  Above the big pump you can see the relocated gasoline cap actuator and all that black stuff on the right side is the stock fuel evaporative control equipment.  All circuits feeding solenoids and pumps have fuses, relays, kick-back diodes to minimize contact arcing, sealed connectors, and use automotive wires of a gauge giving a maximum of 1V drop over the circuit loop.
</span><img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_Engine_Dr1_PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">The engine is a General Electric Model T58-8F.  This is a helicopter turboshaft engine that was converted to a jet engine by some internal modifications and a custom tailpipe.  The engine spins up to 26,000 RPM (idle is 13,000 RPM), draws air at 11,000 CFM, and is rated at 1350 hp.  It weighs only 300 lbm.  It grows as it warms up so the engine mounts have to account for this.  The mounts in the front are rubber and the back are sliding mounts on rubber.  The structure holding the engine was designed using finite element analysis and is redundant.  Strong, damage tolerant, and light.  Second battery and fuse/relay panel on the right, halon fire system and 5 gallon dry sump tank on left.  24V starter motor is in the nose of the engine.  700 A of current goes into that motor for 20 seconds during start-up.  Due to heat, must limit starts to three in one hour.  Big screen is to avoid FOD (foreign object damage).  Jet keeps sucking the rose out of the bud vase on the dash!
</span><img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_Fire_Ext1_PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">A lot of attention to details in the car.  Note the aluminum block holding/protecting the halon gas line, pull line, harness to engine, and oil pressure line.  Rectangular tank under inlet screen is for various fuel drains.  Note temperature gauge and shutoff valve for dry sump tank.  3 gallons of turbine oil at $25/quart (ouch!).  Two-stage PPG paint matching exterior of car was used inside the car.  It is not easy to paint around a lot of bars, etc while crouched in a car, in your dusty home garage, avoiding drips, and with your wife screaming that the fumes will cause brain damage in the kids.  Especially with two-stage where you have multiple coats and critical drying times.  Kids passed their grades so I guess damage was minimal, but more importantly, the paint turned out great!

The other guy wimped out after a few "big-fire" demonstrations.  What you see in the picture is about one-twentieth the full size of the fireball.  Guy standing beside car had never seen it run before and was smiling ear-to-ear throughout the show.  Had I launched, I would have burned him to a crisp.  Well, live and learn.

We're rooting for him and offer suggestions but unfortunately, the California Department of Motor Vehicles did not anticipate such a vehicle so he's out of luck.  Hmmm, the car has two engines making the car a hybrid so maybe we can drive in the commuter lanes along with the Toyota Priuses.
<p>*** Update 7/18/06 *** You have to give the California Department of Motor Vehicles (the DMV) credit for

made a formal request to a federal agency to rule if my Beetle constitutes a

There's one on the other side too.  Here you can make out the four rows of variable inlets/stators at the front of the engine.  Their angle changes with engine speed and are used to avoid compressor stall.  There are 11 compressor stages and 2 turbine stages.  The engine's pressure ratio is 8.3:1.  That's how you work on a jet engine.  Stick it on its end.  Easy to store them that way too.

  <p>This week I was in Rotterdam for <a href="https://ripe86.ripe.net/">a RIPE meeting</a>.
On Friday morning I gave a lightning talk called <a href="https://ripe86.ripe.net/archives/video/1126/">where does my
computer get the time from?</a>
The RIPE meeting website has a copy of my slides and a video of the talk;
this is a blogified version, not an exact transcript.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote a follow-up note, <a href="https://dotat.at/@/2023-05-28-whence-whence-time.html">“Where does ‘where does my computer get
the time from?’ come from?”</a> about some things I left
out of the talk.</p>

<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.001.jpeg" alt="Where does my computer get the time from?"></p>
<p>Where does my computer get the time from?</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.002.jpeg" alt="from NTP"></p>
<p>from NTP - here’s a picture of an NTP packet</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.003.jpeg" alt="David Mills surrounded by clocks"></p>
<p>and here’s a picture of David Mills who invented NTP</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.004.jpeg" alt="Where does my computer get the time from? NTP"></p>
<p>simple question, easy answer, end of talk? No!</p>
<p>let’s peel off some layers…</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.005.jpeg" alt="Where does NTP get the time from? NTP"></p>
<p>stratum 3 NTP servers get the time from stratum 2 NTP servers,</p>
<p>stratum 2 NTP servers get the time from stratum 1 NTP servers,</p>
<p>stratum 1 NTP servers get the time from some reference clock</p>
<p>maybe a radio signal such as MSF in Britain or DCF77 in Germany</p>
<p>but in most cases the reference clock is probably a GPS receiver</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.006.jpeg" alt="Where does NTP get the time from? GPS"></p>
<p>here’s a GPS timing receiver</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.007.jpeg" alt="Where does NTP get the time from? GPS"></p>
<p>and here’s a GPS satellite</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.008.jpeg" alt="Where does GPS get the time from?"></p>
<p>where does GPS get the time from?</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.009.jpeg" alt="Schriever space force base entrance sign"></p>
<p>Schriever Space Force Base in Colorado</p>
<p>they look after a lot of different top secret satellites and other
stuff at Schriever, as you can see from all the mission logos</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.010.jpeg" alt="Schriever space force base aerial photo"></p>
<p>so you can’t get close enough to take a nice photo</p>

<p>Where does Schriever SFB get the time from?</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.012.jpeg" alt="racks of time-keeping equipment with smart blue blanking panels"></p>
<p>the US Naval Observatory Alternate Master Clock
is on site at Schriever in Colorado</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.013.jpeg" alt="the USNO main building"></p>
<p>the US Naval Observatory Alternate Master Clock
gets the time from the US Naval Observatory in Washington DC</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.014.jpeg" alt="where does the USNO get the time from?"></p>
<p>there are three answers</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.015.jpeg" alt="USNO atomic clocks"></p>
<p>the first answer is atomic clocks, lots of atomic clocks</p>
<p>in the background there are dozens of rack mounted caesium beam clocks</p>
<p>in the foreground the black boxes house hydrogen masers</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.016.jpeg" alt="more USNO atomic clocks"></p>
<p>these shiny cylinders are <a href="https://www.cnmoc.usff.navy.mil/Our-Commands/United-States-Naval-Observatory/Precise-Time-Department/The-USNO-Master-Clock/The-USNO-Master-Clock/Rubidium-Fountain-Clocks/">rubidium fountains</a></p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.017.jpeg" alt="aerial photograph of the USNO campus, which is a perfect circle"></p>
<p>the USNO has so many atomic clocks they have entire buildings dedicated to them</p>
<p>When I was preparing this talk I noticed on Apple Maps that there’s a
huge building site in the middle of the USNO campus. It turns out they
are building a fancy new clock house; the main limit on the accuracy
of their clocks is environmental stability: temperature, humidity,
etc. so the new building will have serious air handling.</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.018.jpeg" alt="where does the USNO get the time from?"></p>
<p>the second answer is that UTC is a horrible compromise between time
from atomic clocks and time from earth rotation</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.019.jpeg" alt="the Paris observatory"></p>
<p>so the USNO gets the time from the international earth rotation
service, which is based at the Paris Observatory</p>
<p>twice a year the IERS sends out
<a href="https://datacenter.iers.org/availableVersions.php?id=16">Bulletin C</a>,
which says whether or not there will be a leap second in six months
time; leap seconds are added (or maybe removed) from UTC to keep it in
sync with earth rotation</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.020.jpeg" alt="where does the IERS get the time from?"></p>
<p>the IERS is spread across several organizations which contribute
to its scientific work</p>
<p>for example, you can subscribe to <a href="https://datacenter.iers.org/availableVersions.php?id=6">IERS Bulletin A</a>,
which is a weekly notice with precise details of the earth orientation parameters</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.021.jpeg" alt="the USNO main building"></p>
<p>Bulletin A is sent out by the US Naval observatory</p>
<p>they need to know the exact orientation of the earth under the GPS
satellites, so they can provide precise positioning</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.022.jpeg" alt="where does the USNO get the time from?"></p>
<p>the third answer is, how does the USNO know its atomic clocks are working well?</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.023.jpeg" alt="the pavillion de breteuil"></p>
<p>that information comes from the international bureau of weights and
measures in Paris, who maintain the global standard UTC</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.024.jpeg" alt="where does the BIPM get the time from?"></p>
<p>how does the BIPM determine what UTC is?</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.025.jpeg" alt="Circular T"></p>
<p>the BIPM collects time measurements from national timing laboratories
around the world, and uses those measurements to determine official
UTC</p>
<p>periodically they send out <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/time-ftp/circular-t">Circular T</a>
which has information about the discrepencies between official UTC and
UTC from the various national time labs</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.026.jpeg" alt="diagram of the new SI"></p>
<p>the BIPM is responsible for maintaining the international system of
units, which is defined by the general conference on weights and
measures</p>
<p>the CGPM is an international treaty organization established by the
metre convention of 1875</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.027.jpeg" alt="diagram of the SI highlighting the second"></p>
<p>UTC is an implementation of the SI unit of time, based on quantum
measurements of caesium atoms</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.028.jpeg" alt="where did the CGPM get the time from?"></p>
<p>where did this magic number, about 9.2 GHz, come from?</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.029.jpeg" alt="Essen and Parry standing next to their atomic clock"></p>
<p>in 1955, Louis Essen (on the right) and Jack Parry (left) built
the first caesium atomic clock</p>
<p>the current definition of the second came from the calibration of this clock</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.030.jpeg" alt="where did Essen and Parry get the time from?"></p>
<p>before atomic clocks, the definition of the second was based on
astronomy, so Essen and Parry needed help from astronomers to find out
how fast their clock ticks according to the existing standard of time</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.031.jpeg" alt="the USNO main building"></p>
<p>they got help from the astronomers at the US Naval Observatory</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.032.jpeg" alt="Markowitz and Essen"></p>
<p>the way it worked was William Markowitz measured time by looking at
the skies, and Louis Essen measured time by looking at his atomic
clock, and to correlate their measurements, they both listened to the
WWV radio time signal broadcast by the national bureau of standards in
Washington DC</p>
<p>this project took 3 years, 1955 - 1958</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.033.jpeg" alt="where did Markowitz get the time from?"></p>
<p>Markowitz was measuring the “ephemeris second”</p>
<p>in 1952 the international astronomical union changed the definition of
time so that instead of being based on the rotation of the earth about
its axis, it was based on the orbit of the earth around the sun</p>
<p>in the 1930s they had discovered that the earth’s rotation is not
perfectly even: it slows down and speeds up slightly</p>
<p>clocks were now more precise than the rotation of the earth, so the
ephemeris second was a new more precise standard of time</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.034.jpeg" alt="where did the IAU get the time from?"></p>
<p>the ephemeris second is based on an astronomical ephemeris, which is a
mathematical model of the solar system</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.035.jpeg" alt="tables of the motion of the earth on its axis and around the sun"></p>
<p>the standard ephemeris was produced by Simon Newcomb in the late 1800s</p>
<p>he collected a vast amount of historical astronomical data to create
his mathematical model</p>
<p>it remained the standard until the mid 1980s</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.036.jpeg" alt="Simon Newcomb"></p>
<p>here’s a picture of Simon Newcomb</p>
<p>he is a fine-looking Victorian gentleman</p>
<p>where did he work?</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.037.jpeg" alt="the USNO main building"></p>
<p>at the US naval observatory!</p>
<p>(and the US nautical almanac office)</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.038.jpeg" alt="the Royal Greenwich Observatory"></p>
<p>I have now run out of layers: before this point, clocks were set more
straightforwardly by watching stars cross the sky</p>
<p>so, to summarise my talk, where does my computer get the time from?</p>
<p>it does <em>not</em> get it from the Royal Greenwich Observatory!</p>

                        <p><strong>Discover new ways to optimize database performance and avoid common mistakes that impact latency and throughput</strong></p>
<p>So many things have to align perfectly for impressive database performance. You need to think hard about factors like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The infrastructure your database sits on</li>
<li>How it’s set up</li>
<li>How you’re managing it</li>
<li>How your application interacts with the driver</li>
<li>How the driver interacts with your database</li>
<li>How that database is designed</li>
<li>How well its approach aligns with your specific workload characteristics and requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s just scratching the surface. Behind each of those elements, there’s likely years of engineering efforts from the database side – not to mention all the user-side strategizing, trial-and-error optimization, and high-pressure triaging.</p>
<p>Most teams don’t have that level of time and patience. They need performance, and they want it now.</p>

The authors set out to cover the many different elements that impact database performance, offering clear, practical recommendations based on their own engineering efforts and experience with thousands of real-world database deployments.</p>
<p><a href="https://lp.scylladb.com/database-performance-book-offer">Digital Download + Request Printed Book</a></p>
<p>The complete 270-page book is available now, for free.</p>
<p>Here are a few important things to note…</p>
<h2>It’s not “about” ScyllaDB – but it’s highly relevant for anyone using or considering it</h2>
<p>While this book was written by people who have been working at ScyllaDB, it’s not a book “about” ScyllaDB per se. The authors wanted to explore the topic of database performance at a broader level so the book would be relevant even beyond the ScyllaDB community. It doesn’t matter what database you’re currently using (MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, Cassandra, DynamoDB…). If you’re experiencing some pain related to database latency and/or throughput – or you fear you will suffer soon – this is a book for you.</p>
<p>If you’re considering or already using ScyllaDB, you’ll definitely want to look at this book. It features the collective wisdom of teams who develop ScyllaDB and guide our customers through their most complex challenges. And if you want to discuss these topics in relation to your specific use case, we’d be happy to chat more – <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/company/contact-us/">just contact us</a>.</p>
<p>Also, if you are interested in a book specifically about ScyllaDB, stay tuned to our social media handles. There will be some exciting news on that front quite soon. 😉</p>
<h2>It’s highly opinionated</h2>
<p>When ScyllaDB started working with Discord 5 years ago, one of the things they appreciated most was “<a href="https://www.scylladb.com/2019/03/20/discord-on-the-joy-of-opinionated-systems/">the joy of opinionated systems</a>.” In other words, “people who are good stewards of the system have already figured out what is important.”</p>
<p>This opinionated approach is a hallmark of the <em>Database Performance at Scale</em> book. Whether explaining a performance-critical decision that a database user will likely face or sharing the rationale behind various engineering optimizations, the authors present their perspective on the associated tradeoffs, along with their recommendations on what’s best from the perspective of performance.</p>
<h2>It’s free, it’s open source… and it’s fun</h2>
<p>The authors, and all the engineers throughout both <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/">ScyllaDB</a> and <a href="https://turso.tech/">Turso</a>, are avid open source supporters and contributors. When presented with the opportunity to write a book, everyone agreed that taking an “open source” approach would be the best way to make the finished product readily accessible to all interested readers.</p>

<p>Apress, the book’s publisher, offers an “Open Access” series of books – and that’s what we selected. This means that the digital version is available free of charge, and the entire book is licensed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Print editions are available at cost through all the standard booksellers, and ScyllaDB will be featuring printed books at our events (like <a href="https://www.p99conf.io/">P99 CONF</a>) and through special book giveaways (become eligible by <a href="https://lp.scylladb.com/database-performance-book-offer">signing up here</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, you might not expect a book on databases to be a fun read. That’s fair. But as you might have sensed by now, these authors like to do things a bit differently. Delve into Chapter 1, and see for yourself!</p>

Instead of properly deorbiting the satellite, Dish sent it into a “disposal orbit” at an altitude low enough to pose an orbital debris risk.</p><figure id="5fe93f1d-8e03-4c99-8082-5686b9e09de2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:2,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/oct/02/astronomers-light-pollution-tetris-block-satellite-bluewalker-3-stars-bright&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Astronomers sound alarm over light pollution from huge new satellite&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;5fe93f1d-8e03-4c99-8082-5686b9e09de2&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>“As satellite operations become more prevalent and the space economy accelerates, we must be certain that operators comply with their commitments,” said Loyaan A Egal, the FCC’s enforcement bureau chief, in the statement announcing the Dish settlement. “This is a breakthrough settlement, making very clear the FCC has strong enforcement authority and capability to enforce its vitally important space debris rules.”</p><p>In 2002, Dish launched the satellite into geostationary orbit – a field of space that begins 22,000 miles (36,000km) above Earth. It agreed in 2012 to an orbital debris mitigation plan that, upon completion of EchoStar-7’s mission, would send the the satellite 186 miles (300km) above where it was stationed, into a “graveyard orbit” where it would not be a risk to other active satellites.</p><p>But in 2022, Dish realized that the satellite was low on propellant, and would not have enough to move to its intended destination. Instead, the satellite ended up only 76 miles (122 km) above the active geostationary orbit areas – 178 km off its mark.</p><p>Space debris, broadly defined by the FCC as artificial objects orbiting Earth that are not functional spacecraft, has been a growing concern for the agency. It says that the more old material that stays in orbit, the harder it is for incoming satellites to start and complete new missions. In 2022, the FCC adopted a rule that would require satellite operators to dispose of their satellites within five years of mission completion.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-7">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-7" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>“Right now there are thousands of metric tons of orbital debris in the air above – and it is going to grow,” FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a 2022 statement that accompanied the announcement of the rule. “We need to address it.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"> <main> <h2 id="bitmagnet"> <a href="#bitmagnet" aria-labelledby="bitmagnet"></a> bitmagnet </h2> <p><strong>A self-hosted BitTorrent indexer, DHT crawler, content classifier and torrent search engine with web UI, GraphQL API and Servarr stack integration.</strong></p> <p><img src="https://bitmagnet.io/assets/images/webui-1.png" alt="bitmagnet WebUI screenshot"></p> <blockquote> <p>Important</p> <p>This software is currently in alpha. It is ready to preview some interesting and unique features, but there will likely be bugs, as well as API and database schema changes before the (currently theoretical) 1.0 release. If you’d like to support this project and help it gain momentum, <strong><a href="https://github.com/bitmagnet-io/bitmagnet" target="\_blank">please give it a star on GitHub</a></strong>.</p> <p><a href="https://bitmagnet.io/internals-development.html">If you’re interested in getting involved and you’re a backend GoLang or frontend TypeScript/Angular developer, or you’re knowledgeable about BitTorrent protocols then <strong>I’d like to hear from you</strong></a> - let’s get this thing over the line!</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="dht-what-now"> <a href="#dht-what-now" aria-labelledby="dht-what-now"></a> DHT what now…? </h2> <p>The DHT crawler is <strong>bitmagnet</strong>’s killer feature that (currently) makes it unique. Well, almost unique, read on…</p> <p>So what is it? You might be aware that you can enable DHT in your BitTorrent client, and that this allows you find peers who are announcing a torrent’s hash to a Distributed Hash Table (DHT), rather than to a centralized tracker. DHT’s lesser known feature is that it allows you to crawl the info hashes it knows about. This is how <strong>bitmagnet</strong>’s DHT crawler works works - it crawls the DHT network, requesting metadata about each info hash it discovers. It then further enriches this metadata by attempting to classify it and associate it with known pieces of content, such as movies and TV shows. It then allows you to search everything it has indexed.</p> <p>This means that <strong>bitmagnet</strong> is not reliant on any external trackers or torrent indexers. It’s a self-contained, self-hosted torrent indexer, connected via DHT to a global network of peers and constantly discovering new content.</p> <p>The DHT crawler is <em>not quite</em> unique to <strong>bitmagnet</strong>; another open-source project, <a href="https://github.com/boramalper/magnetico" target="\_blank">magnetico</a> was first (as far as I know) to implement a usable DHT crawler, and was a crucial reference point for implementing this feature. However this project is no longer maintained, and does not provide the other features such as content classification, and integration with other software in the ecosystem, that greatly improve usability.</p> <p><a href="https://bitmagnet.io/internals-development/dht-crawler.html">You can find some more technical details about <strong>bitmagnet</strong>’s DHT crawler here</a>.</p> <h2 id="features--roadmap"> <a href="#features--roadmap" aria-labelledby="features--roadmap"></a> Features &amp; Roadmap </h2> <h3 id="currently-implemented-features"> <a href="#currently-implemented-features" aria-labelledby="currently-implemented-features"></a> Currently implemented features </h3> <ul> <li>A DHT crawler</li> <li>A generic BitTorrent indexer: <strong>bitmagnet</strong> can index torrents from any source, not only the DHT network - currently this is only possible via <a href="https://bitmagnet.io/tutorials/importing.html">the <code>/import</code> endpoint</a>; more user-friendly methods are in the pipeline, see high-priority features below</li> <li>A content classifier that can currently identify movie and television content, along with key related attributes such as language, resolution, source (BluRay, webrip etc.) and enriches this with data from <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">The Movie Database</a></li> <li><a href="https://bitmagnet.io/tutorials/importing.html">An import facility for ingesting torrents from any source, for example the RARBG backup</a></li> <li>A torrent search engine</li> <li>A GraphQL API: currently this provides a single search query; there is also an embedded GraphQL playground at <code>/graphql</code></li> <li>A web user interface implemented in Angular: currently this is a simple single-page application providing a user interface for search queries via the GraphQL API</li> <li><a href="https://bitmagnet.io/tutorials/servarr-integration.html">A Torznab-compatible endpoint for integration with the Serverr stack</a></li> </ul> <h3 id="high-priority-features-not-yet-implemented"> <a href="#high-priority-features-not-yet-implemented" aria-labelledby="high-priority-features-not-yet-implemented"></a> High priority features not yet implemented </h3> <ul> <li>Classifiers for other types of content; enrich current classifiers and weed out incorrect classifications.</li> <li>Ordering of search results: the current alpha preview has no facility for specifying the ordering of results.</li> <li>Search performance optimisations: search is currently fast enough to be usable; it becomes more sluggish once millions of torrents have been indexed - there are some low-hanging fruit in terms of optimisation that will be a near-term priority.</li> <li>A monitoring API and WebUI dashboard showing things like crawler throughput, task queue, database size etc.</li> <li>Authentication, API keys, access levels etc.</li> <li>An admin API, and in general a more complete GraphQL API</li> <li>A more complete web UI</li> <li>Saved searches for content of particular interest, enabling custom feeds in addition to the following feature</li> <li>Smart deletion: there’s a lot of crap out there; crawling DHT can quickly use lots of database disk space, and search becomes slower with millions of indexed torrents of which 90% are of no interest. A smart deletion feature would use saved searches to identify content that you’re <em>not</em> interested in, including but not limited to <abbr title="child sexual abuse material">CSAM</abbr>, and low quality content (such as low resolution movies). It would automatically delete associated metadata and add the info hash to a bloom filter, preventing the torrent from being re-indexed in future.</li> <li>Bi-directional integration with the <a href="https://prowlarr.com/" target="\_blank">Prowlarr indexer proxy</a>: Currently <strong>bitmagnet</strong> can be added as an indexer in Prowlarr; bi-directional integration would allow <strong>bitmagnet</strong> to crawl content from any indexer configured in Prowlarr, unlocking many new sources of content</li> <li>More documentation and more tests!</li> </ul> <h3 id="pipe-dream-features"> <a href="#pipe-dream-features" aria-labelledby="pipe-dream-features"></a> Pipe dream features </h3> <p>This is where things start to get a bit nebulous. For now all focus is on delivering the core features above, but some of these ideas could be explored in future:</p> <ul> <li>In-place seeding: identify files on your computer that are part of an indexed torrent, and allow them to be seeded in place after having moved, renamed or deleted parts of the torrent</li> <li>Integration with popular BitTorrent clients</li> <li>Federation of some sort: allow friends to connect instances and pool the indexing effort, perhaps involving crowd sourcing manual content curation to supplement the automated classifiers</li> <li>Something that looks like a decentralized private tracker; by this I probably mean something that’s based partly on personal trust and manually weeding out any bad actors; I’d be wary of creating something that looks a bit like <a href="https://github.com/Tribler/tribler" target="\_blank">Tribler</a>, which while an interesting project seems to have demonstrated that implementing trust, reputation and privacy at the protocol level carries too much overhead to be a compelling alternative to plain old BitTorrent, for all its imperfections</li> <li>Support for the <a href="https://blog.libtorrent.org/2020/09/bittorrent-v2/" target="\_blank">BitTorrent v2 protocol</a>: It remains to be seen if wider adoption will ever make this a valuable feature</li> </ul> </main> </div></div>]]></description>

<p>The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a cornerstone of the Internet, helping to load web pages, stream videos, and fetch data for your favourite apps.</p>



<p>Last year&nbsp;a new version of the protocol, HTTP/3, was standardized&nbsp;by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the organization in charge of defining Internet technologies. Since then, HTTP/3 and the related QUIC protocol have seen a rapid uptake on the public web. The exact numbers depend on the source and measurement methodology, with HTTP/3 support ranging from&nbsp;<a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-the-web#h3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">19%</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="https://2023.apricot.net/assets/files/APPS314/2023-03-01-quic-apri_1677636425.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50+%</a>&nbsp;of web servers and networks worldwide.</p>







<p>Because these new protocols are heavily used by large companies such as Google and Meta, we can safely say that&nbsp;a large chunk of current Internet traffic already uses HTTP/3 today. In fact, the blog post you’re reading right now was probably loaded over HTTP/3!</p>



<p>In this series, I’ll provide some context on what problems HTTP/3 solves, how it performs, why it’s seen such swift adoption, and what limitations it is still working to overcome.</p>



<h2>Why do we need HTTP/3?</h2>



<p>A network protocol describes how data is communicated between two entities on the network, typically the user’s device and a web server. As there are many different companies building software for the web, the protocol needs to be standardized so that all this software can be ‘interoperable’, that is, they can all understand each other because&nbsp;they follow the same rules.</p>



<p>In practice,&nbsp;we don’t use a single protocol but a combination of several at the same time, each with its own responsibilities and rules (Figure 1). This is to make things flexible and reusable — you can still use the exact same HTTP logic, regardless if you’re using Wi-Fi, cable, or 4G/5G.</p>

<p>Many of the original protocols for the Internet were standardized in the 80s and 90s, meaning they were built with the goals and restrictions of those decades in mind.&nbsp;While some of these protocols have stood the test of time, others have started to show their age. Most problems have been solved by workarounds and clever tricks. However, it was clear something would have to change. This is especially true for the Transport Control Protocol (TCP), which ensures your data reliably gets across the Internet.</p>



<h2>Why TCP is not optimal for today’s web</h2>



<p>HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 rely on TCP to successfully do their job.&nbsp;Before a client and server can exchange an HTTP request/response, they must establish a TCP connection.</p>



<p>Over time, there have been many efforts to update TCP and resolve some of its inefficiencies —&nbsp;TCP still loads webpages as if they were single files instead of a collection of hundreds of individual files. Some of these updates have been successful, but most of the more impactful ones (for example, TCP multipath and TCP Fast Open)&nbsp;took nearly a decade to be practically usable on the public Internet.</p>



<p>The main challenge with implementing changes to TCP is thousands of devices on the Internet all have their own implementation of the TCP protocol. These include phones, laptops, and servers, as well as routers, firewalls, load balancers, and other types of ‘middleboxes’. As such,&nbsp;if we want to update TCP, we have to wait for a significant portion of all these devices to update&nbsp;their implementation, which in practice can take years.</p>



<h3>The QUIC solution</h3>



<p>This became a problem to the point that the most practical way forward was to replace TCP with something entirely new.&nbsp;This replacement is the QUIC protocol, though many still (jokingly) refer to it as TCP 2.0. This nickname is appropriate because QUIC includes many of the same high-level features of TCP but with a couple of crucial changes.</p>



<p>The main change is that&nbsp;QUIC heavily integrates with the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. TLS is responsible for encrypting sensitive data on the web — it’s the thing that provides the S (secure) in HTTPS. With TCP, TLS only encrypts the actual HTTP data (Figure 2). With QUIC,&nbsp;TLS also encrypts large parts of the QUIC protocol itself. This means that metadata, such as packet numbers and connection-close signals, which were visible to (and changeable by) all middleboxes in TCP, are now only available to the client and server in QUIC.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fig2-tcp-vs-quic-packetization-1024x531-1.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="531" src="https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fig2-tcp-vs-quic-packetization-1024x531-1.png" alt="Figure 2 — Encryption differences between TCP+TLS and QUIC. QUIC encrypts much more than just the HTTP data." srcset="https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fig2-tcp-vs-quic-packetization-1024x531-1.png 1024w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fig2-tcp-vs-quic-packetization-1024x531-1-300x156.png 300w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fig2-tcp-vs-quic-packetization-1024x531-1-768x398.png 768w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fig2-tcp-vs-quic-packetization-1024x531-1-624x324.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Figure 2 — Encryption differences between TCP+TLS and QUIC. QUIC encrypts much more than just the HTTP data.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Furthermore, because QUIC is more extensively encrypted, it will be much easier than it was for TCP to change it or to add new features — we only need to update the clients and servers, as the middleboxes can’t decrypt the metadata anyway. This makes&nbsp;QUIC a future-proof protocol that will allow us to more quickly solve new challenges.</p>



<p>Of course,&nbsp;this extra encryption is good for the general security and privacy of the new protocol too. While TCP + TLS are perfect for securing sensitive personal data, such as credit cards or email content, they can still be vulnerable to complex (privacy) attacks, which have become ever more practical to execute due to recent advances in AI. By further encrypting this type of metadata, QUIC is more resilient to sophisticated threat actors.</p>



<p>QUIC also has many other security-related features, including defences against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, with features such as amplification prevention and RETRY packets.</p>



<p>Finally,&nbsp;QUIC also includes a large amount of efficiency and performance improvements compared to TCP, including a faster connection handshake (see Figure 3),&nbsp;<a href="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2020/head-of-line-blocking-in-quic-and-http-3-the-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the removal of the ‘head-of-line blocking’ problem</a>, better packet loss detection/recovery, and ways to deal with users switching networks (I’ll go into more detail on this in my next post).</p>

<h2>We didn’t need HTTP/3; what we needed was QUIC</h2>



<p>Initially, there were attempts to keep HTTP/2 and make minimal adjustments so we could also use QUIC in the lower layers (after all, that’s the whole point of having these different cooperating and reusable protocols). However, it became clear QUIC was just different enough from TCP to make it HTTP/2-incompatible. As such, the decision was made to make a new version of HTTP, just for QUIC, which eventually became HTTP/3.</p>



<p>HTTP/3 is almost identical to HTTP/2. They mainly differ in the technical implementation of the features on top of QUIC or TCP. However, because HTTP/3 can use all of QUIC’s new features,&nbsp;it is expected to be more performant when loading web pages and streaming videos. In practice, it’s especially this aspect that has led to HTTP/3’s rapid adoption.</p>



<p>In my <a href="https://blog.apnic.net/2023/10/02/how-quic-helps-you-seamlessly-connect-to-different-networks/">next post</a>, I’ll go into more detail on a common connectivity problem you’ve most likely experienced and how QUIC can help reduce calls and videos from cutting out when your mobile device changes from using Wi-Fi to cellular connectivity.</p>

<p>And the steady heat building this year could make 2023 not only the hottest year on record but the first to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial temperatures, or the stable climate that preceded the massive release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels. Under the landmark Paris climate accord, nations have pledged to try to keep global warming under that threshold. “It’s very worrying,” says Kate Marvel, a senior climate scientist at Project Drawdown, a nonprofit organization that develops roadmaps for climate solutions.</p>

<p>According to data kept by the Japan Meteorological Agency, this September was about 0.5 degree C (0.9 degree F) hotter than the previous hottest September in 2020. It was also about 0.2 degree C (0.4 degree F) warmer than the previous record high temperature anomaly—a measure of how much warmer or colder a given time period is, compared with the average—which had been set in February 2016 during a blockbuster El Niño.</p>

<p>The September anomaly “is so far above anything we’ve seen before,” says Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist who works at the payment processing firm Stripe and <a href="https://www.theclimatebrink.com/p/visualizing-a-summer-of-extremes">wrote about September’s heat in a recent blog post</a>. On X, formerly known as Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/hausfath/status/1709217151452954998?s=20">he called the feat “absolutely gobsmackingly bananas.”</a></p>

<p>The milestone reached last month comes on the heels <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/july-2023-is-hottest-month-ever-recorded-on-earth/">of July setting the record for the hottest month overall</a>. (July is always the hottest month of the year globally because it occurs at the peak of the Northern Hemisphere summer. The Northern Hemisphere has much more landmass to soak up the sun’s rays than the Southern Hemisphere, so it has the bigger influence on the global annual temperature cycle.)</p>

<p>In a marker of just how much global temperatures have risen in recent decades, Hausfather observes, “this September will be hotter than most Julys before the last decade or two.”</p>

</figure>

<p>Two main factors are at play in driving temperatures to such extremes: their inexorable increase from burning fossil fuels and an El Niño event that is shaping up to be a strong one. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/el-nino-may-break-a-record-and-reshape-weather-around-the-globe/">El Niño is a part of a natural climate cycle</a> that features a tongue of unusually warm waters across the eastern Pacific Ocean. Those waters release heat into the atmosphere and can cause a cascade of changes to key atmospheric circulation patterns linked to the weather around the world.</p>

<p>Heat waves have broken records all over the globe during the past few months, including prolonged events called heat domes that plagued the southern stretch of the U.S. and parts of the Mediterranean. Summerlike temperatures were even felt in South America during the Southern Hemisphere’s winter. Two of the heat waves—one in the U.S. Southwest and one in Europe—were found to be <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/this-summers-record-breaking-heat-waves-would-not-have-happened-without-climate-change/">virtually impossible without global warming</a>. And summerlike heat has continued in places into October.</p>

<p>The most drastic temperature anomalies typically come in the winter months, when El Niño peaks in strength. In fact, the previous most anomalously warm month was February 2016, during one of the strongest El Niños on record. But this year “we’re seeing these [big anomalies] in the Northern Hemisphere summer,” Hausfather says. That leaves open the possibility of even larger anomalies when this event peaks this winter, particularly if it ends up being another strong event.</p>

<p>It is possible there is also some influence from the phasing out of sulfur-containing fuels used by ships because the aerosols spewed into the air from burning those fuels tend to have a slight cooling effect. The eruption of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai volcano in the southern Pacific Ocean last year may also be nudging up temperatures because of the huge amounts of water vapor—also a greenhouse gas—it injected into the atmosphere. But both factors have very small influences, compared with climate change and El Niño.</p>

<p>Given that this El Niño is expected to persist and likely to strengthen, there’s a good chance that 2023 or 2024—or both—will become the hottest year on record, besting 2016 (and 2020, which some agencies who monitor climate have tied with 2016). That isn’t surprising, given that there has been a tenth of a degree of warming since 2016, though it is “remarkable just how quickly we’ve seen warmth this year,” Hausfather says. Part of the apparent rapid warming is because 2023 began in the tail end of an unusual string of three back-to-back La Niña events. These tend to have a cooling impact on the global climate, though La Niñas today are hotter than even El Niños of several decades ago.</p>

<p>Beyond potentially becoming the hottest year on record, 2023 could also be the first year to top 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial temperatures (some individual months have already passed that threshold). But even if that happens, all hope is not lost for meeting the Paris accord goals. That threshold is measured as an average of several decades, and climate scientists have long expected that a single year would pass that mark a decade or so before the world could be considered permanently above that limit. “There is still time to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees,” Marvel says. “It is going to be incredibly difficult. The pathways are narrowing.”</p>

<p>But this year should be considered a warning of the future we face if we don’t take rapid, ambitious action. “This is what the world looks like when it’s 1.5 degrees hotter in a year, and it’s terrible,” she says. When the world does permanently pass 1.5 degrees C, the climate anomalies for individual years will reach higher than that mark.</p>

<p>To stave off that future, every bit of carbon we can keep, or take, out of the atmosphere is crucial. “Every tenth of a degree matters,” Hausfather says.</p></div><section><h3>ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</h3><section><p><img src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/1CA8FD9A-9A98-483D-AE3E18788CF77E53_small.png?h=65&amp;w=65" alt="author-avatar" width="65" height="65"></p><div><ul></ul><p><strong>Andrea Thompson</strong>, an associate editor at <em>Scientific American</em>, covers sustainability.&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/@AndreaTWeather">Follow Andrea Thompson on Twitter</a><span>&nbsp;Credit: Nick Higgins</span></p></div></section></section></section></div>]]></description>

        <p dir="auto">Yes it will. In general terms: <em>everything</em> that uses libcurl could theoretically use libcurl in a way that triggers this vulnerability, assuming that the conditions apply and that a vulnerable libcurl version is used. Of course some/many users will also use libcurl <em>without</em> being able to trigger the vulnerability.</p>

        <p dir="auto">In case you’re asking if the <em>patch</em> to libcurl will require a redistribution of pycurl: most distros ship pycurl with dynamic linkage of libcurl (rather than static linkage). In that case, pycurl would <em>almost certainly</em> benefit from the changes to the (dynamically linked) libcurl without repackaging/redistribution.</p>
<p dir="auto">(I say “almost certainly” because the libcurl patch might introduce a relevant ABI change which would require changes to pycurl but I find that very unlikely since there’s no such notice in the OP above.)</p>

        <p dir="auto">Well "this one software project" is one of the most critical ones out there... And I think we all know that OpenSSL is far from perfect (even though I think they improved a lot over the last years) - but guess what ,everyone was happy that they announced it in advance so people could prepare to patch ASAP when the patch hit.</p>
<p dir="auto">Do you seriously prefer to be surprised - maybe on your day off, away from a proper computer - with an urgent update you need to install, instead of knowing some days in advance that you may need to quickly install a patch on a given day?</p>

A TPV system generally consists of a thermal emitter that can reach high temperatures, near or beyond 1,000 C, and a photovoltaic diode cell that can absorb photons coming from the heat source.</p><p>The technology has drawn the interest of scientists for decades, because it is able to <span><span>capture sunlight in the entire solar spectrum and has the technical potential to beat the Shockley-Queisser limit of traditional photovoltaics. However, the efficiencies reported thus far have been too low to make it commercially viable, as TPV devices still suffer from optical and thermal losses.</span></span></p><p>“Until now, TPV technology has met neither the efficiency threshold required to compete with traditional heat engines nor the manufacturability threshold required to produce the technology at scale,” said Antora Energy. “Now, Antora has met both of these critical thresholds, demonstrating heat-to-electricity conversion efficiencies greater than 40%, and demonstrating the capability to manufacture TPV at scale.”</p><div id="mid-article-bibblio" data-action="Internal" data-title="Popular content" data-catalogue="Articles" data-location="Mid Single Article"><h3>Popular content</h3></div><p>The startup said it has secured funding from the California Energy Commission to build the TPV manufacturing line in California in 2021.</p><p>“Some of Antora’s earliest funding was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy to develop TPV technology in partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Arizona State University,” said the company.</p><p>In April, a group of researchers from the <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/14/mit-scientists-develop-pv-cleaning-system-based-on-electrostatic-repulsion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) and the US Department of Energy's <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/09/nrel-scientists-test-back-contact-architecture-on-perovskite-solar-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> (NREL) unveiled a <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/31/novel-approach-for-thermophotovoltaics-promises-higher-efficiencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thermophotovoltaic</a> (TPV) cell featuring <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/04/four-terminal-iii-v-solar-cell-with-32-57-efficiency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">III–V materials</a> with bandgaps between 1.0 and 1.4 eV.

<p>The suspect components — which Delta declined to identify — were found on an unspecified number of its engines, a company spokesman said Monday. Those engines account for less than 1% of the more than 2,100 power plants on its mainline fleet, the spokesman said. &nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://fortune.com/company/american-airlines-group/" target="_blank" rel="">American Airlines Group</a> Inc., <a href="https://fortune.com/company/united-continental-holdings/" target="_blank" rel="">United Airlines</a> Holdings Inc. and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/southwest-airlines/" target="_blank" rel="">Southwest Airlines</a> Co. <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/22/why-so-many-flights-canceled-delayed-aog-technics-fake-parts-american-airlines/" target="_self" rel="">previously disclosed finding parts from AOG Technics</a> Ltd. on aircraft engines. That London-based company is at the center of probes by regulators into spare engine parts it sold for a longstanding type of jet engine made by CFM International Inc., a joint venture of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/general-electric/" target="_blank" rel="">General Electric</a> Co. and <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/22/safran-ceo-cannot-quantify-fake-parts-scandal-rocking-airlines/" target="_self" rel="">Safran SA</a>.</p>



<p>Delta would not say if the engines with the fraudulently documented parts had been on planes while they were in service. The problematic pieces, which were certified by AOG, were detected during engine work by an unnamed third party, the spokesman said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As many as 21 of Delta’s engines could have been affected, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data provided by the airline, which would represent the most among US carriers that have disclosed a number. As many as 96 total engines were impacted by parts supplied by AOG, GE has said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Delta has been informed by one of our engine service providers that a small number of engines they overhauled for us contain certain parts that do not meet documentation requirements,” the company said in a statement. “Working with the overhaul provider, we are in the process of replacing those parts and remain in compliance with all FAA guidelines.”</p>



<p>None of Delta’s aircraft are currently flying with unapproved parts, and the <a href="https://fortune.com/company/discovery-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="">discovery</a> hasn’t affected flight operations, the Delta spokesman said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Airlines, maintenance providers and regulators across the globe have been scouring records to hunt down AOG-supplied parts with forged airworthiness documents after European authorities in August determined the parts broker had supplied suspect components. Virgin Australia Airlines Pty also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-18/virgin-australia-finds-second-jet-part-with-fake-certificate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found engines</a>&nbsp;with suspect parts.</p>



<p>AOG last month was ordered by a London judge to hand over records to help identify additional suspect parts after GE and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/safran/" target="_blank" rel="">Safran</a> filed a lawsuit seeking documents relating to “every single sale of products.”</p></div><div id="text1_wrapper" data-cy="subscriptionPlea">

<p><a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-12-0-final-is-here/35186">Python 3.12.0</a> has been released! 🥳 There are multiple people
and tons of steps behind every successful release of Python which I partially documented in the article "<a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-9">Visualizing the CPython release process</a>".
This week I was invited to discuss the article on Talk Python with Michael Kennedy. You can listen to the <a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/431/visualizing-cpython-release-process">full episode on talkpython.fm</a>.</p>

<h2 id="improving-supply-chain-integrity-of-the-python-release-process">Improving supply chain integrity of the Python release process</h2>

<p>Since the entire process has happened in order to deliver 3.12.0, I wanted to discuss how it can be tweaked to provide
better assurances of the integrity of the built artifacts. I'll be discussing these improvements with release managers after the dust has settled around the 3.12.0 release

<i>Left is current process, right is proposed changes.</i>
</center>

<p>Currently, <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/">the source tarballs for Python 3.12.0</a> are built locally on the Release Manager's machine from the
tagged commit (1). This process being local to the release manager's machine using release-tool (2) means there's
no verifiability of the process. Whether intentional or not, the release manager's environment can have an influence
on the resulting built artifact, for example if extra files are included or excluded from a dirty build environment or checkout.
This is a similar situation for the macOS installer builds (4).</p>

<p>If the source tarballs were instead built using the public commit as a verified input instead of using a local machine,
any tampering would either be thwarted (by requiring a known specific commit to be used as input) or would at a minimum
be publicly traceable (by the commit itself being public, so any injected code would be publicly visible).</p>

<p>Using a public commit (instead of a tag) also means that if the tag is changed mid-release (which can happen with only write access to the release managers fork (3))
then the commit SHA won't match the expected one for the given Python release. This provides better assurances over using a git tag alone.</p>

<p>I proposed <a href="https://github.com/sethmlarson/release-tools/blob/build-source-tar/.github/workflows/build-source-artifacts.yml">and implemented</a>
such a workflow using GitHub Actions (5). This setup is very similar to the one used already for Windows installers
and Azure Pipelines, where the input to the workflow is a specific commit and git repository (for releases, this would be
the release managers' fork of <code>python/cpython</code>).</p>

<p>Using this implementation I was able to verify that the contents of the Python 3.12.0 source tarballs <a href="https://github.com/sethmlarson/release-tools/actions/runs/6381817883">match exactly</a>
with what was built by the 3.12 release manager Thomas Wouters, and that my own build used the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/releases/tag/v3.12.0">same commit as Python 3.12.0</a> (<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/0fb18b02c8ad56299d6a2910be0bab8ad601ef24"><code>0fb18b0</code></a>) using <a href="https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier">SLSA verifier</a>:</p>

<p>Now that we've verified the provenance of these "reference" builds, we can check their contents against the actual builds of CPython:</p>

<div>
<pre><span></span><code><span># Make two directories to make comparing the</span>
<span># two tarball's contents possible.</span>
$ mkdir a/ b/

<span># Download the Python tarball from python.org</span>
<span># and verify it's checksum</span>
$ wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.0/Python-3.12.0.tgz
$ <span>echo</span> <span>'51412956d24a1ef7c97f1cb5f70e185c13e3de1f50d131c0aac6338080687afb  Python-3.12.0.tgz'</span> <span>|</span> sha256sum --check
Python-3.12.0.tgz: OK

<span># Extract the two tarballs into directories a and b.</span>
<span># Remember the one in 'a/' is the reference, 'b/' is actual.</span>
$ tar -xzvf src/Python-3.12.0.tgz -C a/
$ tar -xzvf Python-3.12.0.tgz -C b/

<span># Do a recursive content diff. Unfortunately we can't</span>
<span># check the tarball checksums directly because metadata</span>
<span># will be different between the two. No output means</span>
<span># the two directories :tada:are identical in content! 🥳</span>
$ git diff --no-index a/ b/
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Success! The <code>tgz</code> source tarbll contents match exactly what was created by the reference build.
Comparing the <code>tar.xz</code> contents are left as an exercise to the reader. ;)</p>

<p>These source tarballs are important because they're the "source of truth" for many installs of Python, especially downstream
distributions like Debian or Fedora. These source tarballs also <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/0ada42d89dcf186a22ff820159dec378f2cde077/plugins/python-build/share/python-build/3.12.0#L6">get used automatically by pyenv</a> when compiling from source.
So not being verifiable against the commit or tag means that if an attack were to inject code into this build, not having
a trace against the public commit would make this type of attack much tougher to detect.</p>

<h2 id="tracking-how-python-subcomponents-change-using-sboms">Tracking how Python subcomponents change using SBOMs</h2>

<p>Even though the Python APIs haven't changed, there's been lots of movement below the surface.
We can use Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOMs) to track the subcomponents of a software distribution
and how they change between releases.</p>

<p>I created an <a href="https://github.com/sethmlarson/cpython-sbom/blob/main/sboms/Python-3.12.0.tgz.spdx.json">SBOM for Python 3.12.0</a> and then compared the components against the ones included in Python 3.11.6.
Comparing the two SBOM documents revealed the differences between the two release streams:</p>

<p>Let's dive into those changes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/101039">Python 3.12 removes <code>setuptools</code></a> from the <code>ensurepip</code> module which was previously needed to bootstrap pip and venv in a Python environment.
Now in 3.12.0 there's only a bundled copy of <code>pip</code> which includes many other bundled dependencies like Requests and certifi.
These packages <a href="https://github.com/sethmlarson/cpython-sbom/issues/10">still need to be captured in the CPython SBOM</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99108">Python 3.12 replaces the implementation of hashlib algorithms using OpenSSL and tiny_sha3</a> with a <a href="https://github.com/hacl-star/hacl-star">new backend called HACL*</a> (pronounced "H-A-C-L star")
which means the tiny_sha3 project can be removed. This new backend is formally verified using F* to provide memory safety
and avoid many common security vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100540">Python 3.12 removes the small libffi stub for OSX</a> which was unused
after <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/72677">adding support for macOS 11 and Apple Silicon</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Seeing mostly removals and replacements with secure implementations is a great sign! Nice work core developers.
I'm hoping to get more visibility into the macOS and Windows installers using SBOMs as well, so changes there can also be tracked.</p>

<h2 id="other-items">Other items</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ossf/alpha-omega/pull/249">Added PSF engagement report for OpenSSF Alpha-Omega</a> for the month of September.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vstinner/python-security/pull/42">Added redirect to readers of python-security.readthedocs.io</a> to the PSF Advisory Database.</li>

                                    <p>The purpose of this article is to plot a fascinating story in the history of mathematics. The 4000-year-old story of Pythagoras and his famous theorem is worthy of recounting – even for the math-phobic readership. It is more than a <i>math</i> story, as it tells a history of two great civilizations of antiquity rising to prominence 4000 years ago, along with historic and legendary persons, who not only define the period, but whose individual life stories are quite engaging. Moreover, the theorem seemingly has no ending, as every year students, academicians and problem solvers with a mathematical bent tackle the theorem in an attempt to add new and innovative proofs. In addition, a 350-year-old generalized version of the Pythagorean Theorem, which was proposed by an amateur mathematician, was finally solved, and made the front-page of the <i>New York Times</i> in 1993.</p><div id="Sec1-section" data-title="BRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF PYTHAGORAS"><h2 id="Sec1">BRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF PYTHAGORAS</h2><div id="Sec1-content"><p>The Greek mathematician Pythagoras has high name recognition, not only in the history of mathematics. Everyone who has studied geometry can recall, well after the high school years, some aspect of the Pythagorean Theorem. However, the story of Pythagoras and his famous theorem is not well known. Some story plot points are: the famous theorem goes by several names grounded in the behavior of the day (discussed later in the text), including the Pythagorean Theorem, Pythagoras’ Theorem and notably Euclid I 47. The Pythagorean Theorem is arguably the most <i>famous</i> statement in mathematics, and the fourth most <i>beautiful</i> equation.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Journal Physics World (2004), as reported in the New York Times, Ideas and Trends, 24 October 2004, p. 12." href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jt.2009.16#ref-CR1" id="ref-link-section-d94401022e279">1</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2" title="Maor, E.

However, ironically, not much is really known about him – not even his likeness. What is <i>known</i> about Pythagoras is generally considered more <i>fiction</i> than fact, as historians who lived hundreds of years later provided the <i>facts</i> about his life. There are definite details of Pythagoras’ life from early biographies that use original sources, yet are written by authors who attribute divine powers to him, and present him as a deity figure. Consequently, most historians treat this information as legend.

He is an extremely important figure in the development of mathematics, yet relatively little is known about his mathematical achievements. Unlike many later Greek mathematicians, who wrote a number of books, there are no writings by Pythagoras. However, there is evidence that Pythagoras founded a school (in what is now Crotone, to the east of the heel of southern Italy) named <i>the Semicircle of Pythagoras</i> – half-religious and half-scientific, which followed a code of secrecy. Because secrecy is often controversial, Pythagoras is a mysterious figure. The members of the Semicircle of Pythagoras – the Pythagoreans – were bound by an allegiance that was strictly enforced. However, the Semicircle was more than just a school that studied intellectual disciplines, including in particular philosophy, mathematics and astronomy.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 7" title="

The latter is reflected in the Pythagorean motto: <i>Number Rules the Universe</i>.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 6" title="Maor, E.

Pythagoreans consumed vegetarian dried and condensed food and unleavened bread (as matzos, used by the Biblical Jewish priestly class (the Kohanim), and used today during the Jewish holiday of Passover).<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 8" title="

Moreover, out of respect for their leader, many of the discoveries made by the Pythagoreans were attributed to Pythagoras himself; this would account for the term ‘Pythagoras’ Theorem’. Consequently, of Pythagoras’ actual work nothing is known. On the other hand, his school practiced collectivism, making it hard to distinguish between the work of Pythagoras and that of his followers; this would account for the term ‘Pythagorean Theorem’. Therefore, the true discovery of a particular Pythagorean result may never be known. Regardless of the uncertainty of Pythagoras’ actual contributions, however, his school made outstanding contributions to mathematics.</p><p>Is seems that Pythagoras was the first person to define the consonant acoustic relationships between strings of proportional lengths. Specifically, strings of equal tension of proportional lengths create tones of proportional frequencies when plucked. For example, a string that is 2 feet long will vibrate <i>x</i> times per second (that is, hertz, a unit of frequency equal to one cycle per second), while a string that is 1 foot long will vibrate twice as fast: 2<i>x</i>. Furthermore, those two frequencies create a perfect octave.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 9" title="

The Pythagoreans were so troubled over the finding of irrational numbers that they swore each other to secrecy about its existence. It is known that one Pythagorean did tell someone outside the school, and he was never to be found thereafter, that is, he was murdered, as Pythagoras himself was murdered by oppressors of the Semicircle of Pythagoras.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 12" title="

The number immediately under the horizontal diagonal is 1; 24, 51, 10 (this is the modern notation for writing Babylonian numbers, in which the commas separate the sexagesition ‘digits’, and a semicolon separates the integral part of a number from its fractional part). Writing this number in the base-10 system, one gets 1+24/60+51/60<sup>2</sup>+10/60<sup>3</sup>=1.414213, which is nothing other than the decimal value of the square root of 2, accurate to the nearest one hundred thousandth.</p><p>The conclusion is inescapable. The Babylonians knew the relation between the length of the diagonal of a square and its side: <i>d</i>=square root of 2. This was probably the first number known to be irrational.

First, it proves that the Babylonians knew how to compute the square root of a number with remarkable accuracy. The unknown scribe who carved these numbers into a clay tablet nearly 4000 years ago showed a simple method of computing: multiply the side of the square by the square root of 2. But there remains one unanswered question: Why did the scribe choose a side of 30 for his example? Probably, 30 was used for convenience, as it was part of the Babylonian system of sexagesimal, a base-60 numeral system. From this one derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 min in an hour and 360 (60 × 6) degrees in a circle.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="

The manuscript was prepared in 1907 and published in 1927. A revised second edition appeared in 1940, and this was reprinted by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics in 1968 as part of its ‘Classics in Mathematics Education’ series. Loomis received literally hundreds of new proofs from after his book was released up until his death, but he could not keep up with his compendium. As for the exact number of proofs, no one is sure how many there are. Surprisingly, geometricians often find it quite difficult to determine whether certain proofs are in fact distinct proofs. Befitting of someone who collects solutions of the Pythagorean Theorem (I belittle neither the effort nor its value), Loomis, known for living an orderly life, extended his writing to his own obituary in 1934, which he left in a letter headed ‘For the Berea Enterprise immediately following my death’. He died on 11 December 1940, and the obituary was published as he had written it, except for the date of his death and the addresses of some of his survivors.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 21" title="http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/math/Ohio-section/bicen/esloomis.html." href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jt.2009.16#ref-CR21" id="ref-link-section-d94401022e685">21</a></sup></p><div data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-7" data-title="Figure 7"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig7" data-test="figure-caption-text">Figure 7</b></figcaption><div><div><a data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jt.2009.16/figures/7" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fjt.2009.16/MediaObjects/41495_2009_Article_BFjt200916_Fig7_HTML.jpg?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="Fig7" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fjt.2009.16/MediaObjects/41495_2009_Article_BFjt200916_Fig7_HTML.jpg" alt="figure 7" loading="lazy"></picture></a></div><p>Elisha Scott Loomis.</p></div><p><a data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jt.2009.16/figures/7" data-track-dest="link:Figure7 Full size image" aria-label="Full size image figure 7" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span></a></p></figure></div></div></div><div id="Sec5-section" data-title="A 12-YEAR-OLD EINSTEIN ‘PROVES’ THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM"><h2 id="Sec5">A 12-YEAR-OLD EINSTEIN ‘PROVES’ THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM</h2><div id="Sec5-content"><p>According to his autobiography, a preteen Albert Einstein (<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jt.2009.16#Fig8">Figure 8</a>)

</p><blockquote><p>At the age of 12, I experienced a second wonder of a totally different nature: in a little book dealing with Euclidean plane geometry, which came into my hands at the beginning of a school year. Here were assertions, as for example the intersection of the three altitudes of a triangle in one point, which – though by no means evident – could nevertheless be proved with such certainty that any doubt appeared to be out of the question. This lucidity and certainty made an indescribable impression upon me. For example I remember that an uncle told me the Pythagorean Theorem before the holy geometry booklet had come into my hands. After much effort I succeeded in ‘proving’ this theorem on the basis of the similarity of triangles … for anyone who experiences [these feelings] for the first time, it is marvelous enough that man is capable at all to reach such a degree of certainty and purity in pure thinking as the Greeks showed us for the first time to be possible in geometry.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 23" title="Schilpp, P.

Fermat conjectured that there were no non-zero integer solutions for <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> when <i>n</i> was greater than 2. He did not leave a proof, though. Instead, in the <i>margin</i> of a textbook, he wrote that he knew that this relationship was not possible, but he did not have enough room on the page to write it down. His conjecture became known as <i>Fermat's Last Theorem</i>. This may appear to be a simple problem on the surface, but it was not until 1993 when Andrew Wiles of Princeton University finally proved the 350-year-old marginalized theorem, which appeared on the front page of the <i>New York Times</i>.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 36" title="

It is therefore surprising to find that Fermat was a <i>lawyer</i>, and only an <i>amateur</i> mathematician. Also surprising is the fact that he published only one mathematical paper in his life, and that was an anonymous paper written as an appendix to a colleague's book.</p><p>Because Fermat refused to publish his work, his friends feared that it would soon be forgotten unless something was done about it. His son Samuel undertook the task of collecting Fermat's letters and other mathematical papers, comments written in books and so on with the goal of publishing his father's mathematical ideas. Samuel found the <i>marginal</i> note (<i>the proof</i> could not fit on the page) in his father's copy of Diophantus's <i>Arithmetica</i>.

He earned his BA in 1974 after study at Merton College, Oxford, and a PhD in 1980 after research at Clare College, Cambridge. His graduate research was guided by John Coates beginning in the summer of 1975. Together they worked on the arithmetic of elliptic curves with complex multiplication using the methods of Iwasawa theory.</p><p>He further worked with Barry Mazur on the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory over <i>Q</i> and soon afterwards generalized this result to totally real fields. Taking approximately 7 years to complete the work, Wiles was the first person to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, earning him a place in history. Andrew Wiles’ most famous mathematical result is that all rational semi-stable elliptic curves are modular, which, in particular, implies Fermat's Last Theorem.</p><p>Wiles was introduced to Fermat's Last Theorem at the age of 10. He tried to prove the theorem using textbook methods and later studied the work of mathematicians who had tried to prove it. When he began his graduate studies, he stopped trying to prove the theorem and began studying elliptic curves under the supervision of John Coates.</p><p>In the 1950s and 1960s, a connection between elliptic curves and modular forms was conjectured by the Japanese mathematician Goro Shimura based on some ideas that Yutaka Taniyama posed. In the West, this conjecture became well known through a paper by André Weil. With Weil giving conceptual evidence for it, it is sometimes called the Shimura–Taniyama–Weil conjecture. It states that every rational elliptic curve is modular. The full conjecture was proven by Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad, Fred Diamond and Richard Taylor in 1998 using many of the methods that Andrew Wiles used in his 1995 published papers.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 38" title="

His work <i>Elements</i> is the most successful textbook in the history of mathematics. Euclid I 47 is often called the <i>Pythagorean Theorem</i>, called so by Proclus, a Greek philosopher who became head of Plato's Academy and is important mathematically for his commentaries on the work of other mathematicians centuries after Pythagoras and even centuries after Euclid.</p>

                      <p>So many people, young and old, famous and not famous, <i>have touched</i> the Pythagorean Theorem. The eccentric mathematics teacher Elisha Scott Loomis spent a lifetime collecting all known proofs and writing them up in <i>The Pythagorean Proposition,</i> a compendium of 371 proofs. The manuscript was published in 1927, and a revised, second edition appeared in 1940. As for the exact number of proofs, no one is sure how many there are. Surprisingly, geometricians often find it quite difficult to determine whether some proofs are in fact distinct proofs. Moreover, the theorem seemingly has no ending, as every year students, academicians and problem solvers with a mathematical bent tackle the theorem in an attempt to add new and innovative proofs.</p>

                      <p>In addition, many people's lives <i>have been touched</i> by the Pythagorean Theorem. A 12-year-old Albert Einstein was touched by the earthbound spirit of the Pythagorean Theorem. The wunderkind provided a proof that was notable for its elegance and simplicity. However, the spirit of the Pythagoras’ Theorem was not finished with young Einstein: two decades later he used the Pythagorean Theorem in the Special Theory of Relativity (in a four-dimensional form), and in a vastly expanded form in the General Theory of Relativity. That Einstein used Pythagorean Theorem for his Relativity would be enough to show Pythagorean Theorem's value, or importance to the world. But, people continued to find value in the Pythagorean Theorem, namely, Wiles.</p>

                      <p>The theorem's spirit also visited another youngster, a 10-year-old British Andrew Wiles, and returned two decades later to an unknown Professor Wiles. Young Wiles tried to prove the theorem using textbook methods, and later studied the work of mathematicians who had tried to prove it. When he began his graduate studies, he stopped trying to prove the theorem and began studying elliptic curves, which provided the path for proving Fermat's Theorem, the news of which made to the front page of the <i>New York Times</i> in 1993.

      <article role="main">
        <p><em>Minor terminological nitpick.</em></p>

<p>People often describe the LLM as ‘hallucinating’ information whenever it makes up information which seems like it should fit for a given query even when it is trivially false. While evocative, this isn’t actually correct terminology. We already have a perfectly word for this precisely phenomenon in psychology: confabulation.</p>

<p>Confabulation is typically used in a psychiatric context when people have some kind of brain damage, especially to memory, which causes them not to be able to explain or answer questions correctly. For instance, if an amnesiac patient is asked questions about an event they were previously at, instead of admitting they do not know, they would invent a plausile story. Similarly, in split-brain patients, where the corpus callosum is severed so each half of the brain cannot talk to each other, patients can invent elaborate explanations for why the other half of their body is doing a specific thing, even when the experimenter knows this is not the case because they have prompted it with something differently.  In general, people confabulating invent plausible sounding justifications which have no basis in fact. This is usually not conscious with an intent to deceive but instead appear to strongly believe in the story they have just reported. This behaviour is identical to what LLMs do. When they are forced to give an answer using a fact they do not know, they cannot say that they don’t know, since in training such examples would be followed by the actual fact. Instead, they make up something plausible. They confabulate.</p>

<p>More importantly, if we recognize that what LLMs are really doing is confabulating, we can try to compare and contrast their behaviour with that of humans. Humans confabulate in a wide variety of circumstances and especially with some neural pathologies such as with memory impairments and in split-brain patient. Funnily enough, these are similar to a LLM. What are LLMs but humans with extreme amnesia and no central coherence?</p>

<p>Additionally, salaries experienced their most significant year-over-year decline, dropping by 3% from $161,000 to $156,000. However, despite economic volatility, job seekers in the U.S. maintained their salary expectations at around $146,000.</p>

<p>Amid the rise of artificial intelligence and corporate belt-tightening, junior talent with less than four years of experience has experienced the most significant salary decrease–nearly 5% year-over-year.</p>

<p>Tech professionals have been moving from expensive cities to lower-cost locations. U.S. inflation-adjusted remote salaries have been higher on average. Employers have decreased the number of open roles in high-cost-of-living markets by 19% and have nearly quadrupled the number of positions in low-cost-of-living markets to 9% since 2020. Most notably, the San Francisco Bay Area saw the most significant decrease in role volume on Hired’s platform. Nevertheless, it continues to command the highest average salary of $178,000</p>


<p>Experienced engineers who can efficiently resolve issues are in high demand, particularly with the introduction of AI tools and increased cybersecurity challenges. Engineering managers earn the highest salaries at $202,000 in the U.S.</p>
<p>Employers on Hired’s marketplace have a higher demand for specialized engineers, especially for AI applications, such as machine learning, as well as cybersecurity, data, and backend engineers. However, nearly half of employers (47%) project they will leverage AI to reduce headcounts by 2029.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="announcing-divan">Announcing Divan!</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nvzqz/divan">Divan</a> is a framework for quick <strong>comfy
bench</strong>marking of <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> code.</p>
<p>Get started easily with <a href="#examples">examples</a> that span from introductory to advanced
scenarios. The entire <a href="https://github.com/nvzqz/divan/tree/v0.1.0/examples/benches">example benchmark
suite</a> compiles and
runs in 40 seconds on my machine.</p>
<h2 id="compared-to-criterion">Compared to Criterion</h2>
<p>The current go-to Rust benchmarking library is
<a href="https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs">Criterion.rs</a>, a port of <a href="https://github.com/haskell/criterion">Haskell’s
Criterion</a>. It works very well and has
many useful features.</p>
<p>However, I believed we could have a <a href="#simpler-benchmarking">simpler API</a> while
being more powerful, such as <a href="#generic-benchmarks">benchmarking generic functions</a>.</p>

<p>Divan’s <a href="#sample-size-scaling">sample size scaling</a> enables you to run benchmarks in CI due to reduced
timing noise. To demonstrate, <a href="https://github.com/nvzqz/divan/blob/v0.1.0/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L119-L140">all examples are benchmarked in
CI</a>:</p>

<p>You can eyeball the <code>iters</code> column to check how contention from multi-threading
affects the function. The number of iterations decreases as the duration of each
iteration increases.</p>
<p>Sample count is always the next multiple of thread count, which is why 8 threads
produce 104 samples when sample count defaults to 100. This ensures at least 100
samples run under the same conditions: competing against 7 other threads.</p>
<p>To increase the chance for contention, all threads are <a href="https://github.com/nvzqz/divan/blob/v0.1.0/src/bench/mod.rs#L820-L828">synchronized immediately
before and
after</a> the
sampled section using a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Barrier.html"><code>Barrier</code></a>. This also prevents work done by other

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>I deliberately designed Divan with multiple considerations in mind, the most
important being <a href="#simpler-benchmarking">simpler benchmarking</a> and <a href="#getting-out-of-your-way">getting out of your way</a>.</p>
<h3 id="simpler-benchmarking">Simpler Benchmarking</h3>
<p>From the beginning, my goal was to make Rust benchmarking simple and easy. Divan
accomplishes this in many ways:</p>
<h4 id="register-benchmarks-anywhere">Register Benchmarks Anywhere</h4>
<p>Rust’s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes/testing.html#the-test-attribute"><code>#[test]</code></a>
attribute makes unit testing very simple and straightforward. Divan achieves the
same simplicity with
<a href="https://docs.rs/divan/0.1.0/divan/attr.bench.html"><code>#[divan::bench]</code></a> using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)">linker</a> shenanigans to make benchmarked functions visible to
<a href="https://docs.rs/divan/0.1.0/divan/fn.main.html"><code>divan::main()</code></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.rs/linkme"><code>linkme</code></a> provides
<a href="https://docs.rs/linkme/0.1.0/linkme/struct.DistributedSlice.html"><code>DistributedSlice</code></a>,
which coerces to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html"><code>&amp;[T]</code></a> using link-time pseudo-symbols for the range of
start and end addresses.</li>
<li>For other platforms, Divan implements
<a href="https://github.com/nvzqz/divan/blob/v0.1.0/src/entry/list.rs#L6-L13"><code>EntryList</code></a>,
a thread-safe append-only linked list constructed before <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/crates-and-source-files.html#main-functions"><code>main</code></a> runs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Linker-based approaches to registration are limited to few platforms. Divan is
<a href="https://github.com/nvzqz/divan/actions/workflows/ci.yml">tested in CI</a> to work
on macOS, Linux, and Windows.</p>
<h4 id="bencher-by-value"><code>Bencher</code> By-Value</h4>
<p>When benchmarking with <a href="#benchmark-context">context</a>, the <a href="https://docs.rs/divan/0.1.0/divan/struct.Bencher.html"><code>Bencher</code></a> argument is
provided by-value instead of
<a href="https://docs.rs/criterion/0.5.1/criterion/struct.Criterion.html#method.bench_function">by-reference</a>.
Divan then leverages the <a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/patterns/creational/builder.html">builder
pattern</a>
to provide various benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce cognitive load when reading and writing benchmarks.</li>
<li>Prevent accidental reuse by making <a href="https://docs.rs/divan/0.1.0/divan/struct.Bencher.html"><code>Bencher</code></a> no longer usable after you’ve
called a method like <a href="https://docs.rs/divan/0.1.0/divan/struct.Bencher.html#method.bench"><code>bench</code></a>. If a benchmark method is not called, the
compiler will warn that the value must be used.</li>
<li>More powerful polymorphism with <a href="#benchmark-inputs">benchmark inputs</a>, where later operations
like <a href="https://docs.rs/divan/0.1.0/divan/struct.Bencher.html#method.input_counter"><code>input_counter</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/divan/0.1.0/divan/struct.Bencher.html#method.bench_values"><code>bench_values</code></a> act on the input type. See <a href="#type-driven-apis">type-driven APIs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sample-size-scaling">Sample Size Scaling</h3>
<p>An operation may be too fast for the timer to measure. On Mac M1, the smallest
duration for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/struct.Instant.html"><code>Instant</code></a> and <a href="#cpu-timestamp">CPU timestamp</a> is 41 nanoseconds, which cannot
accurately measure an addition that takes 1 nanosecond.</p>
<p>Divan overcomes timer precision by using <em>ν(s)</em> many iterations per sample,
where <em>t(s)</em> is at least 100&nbsp;×&nbsp;timer precision. I chose 100 because it
is easy to reason about and produces high quality results. This is calculated by
re-timing each <em>t(2&nbsp;×&nbsp;s)</em> so that the final result is not solely
dependent on the initial duration.</p>

implemented with the most accurate timer. I’m open to making sample size scaling
smarter, but the current approach works well enough.</p>
<p>This paper also concludes that the smallest duration is the most meaningful
number, because any extra time spent can be attributed to error due to poor
performance conditions, such as being unscheduled by the operating system. I
agree 99.999% of the time, except for when you want to <a href="#measure-thread-contention">measure thread

<p>When benchmarking with <a href="https://docs.rs/divan/0.1.0/divan/struct.Bencher.html"><code>Bencher</code></a>, you cannot call any of the
<a href="https://docs.rs/divan/0.1.0/divan/struct.Bencher.html#method.bench_values"><code>bench_values</code></a>/<a href="https://docs.rs/divan/0.1.0/divan/struct.Bencher.html#method.bench_refs"><code>bench_refs</code></a>/<a href="https://docs.rs/divan/0.1.0/divan/struct.Bencher.html#method.input_counter"><code>input_counter</code></a> functions until you provide
<a href="#benchmark-inputs">benchmark inputs</a>. Likewise, the standard <a href="https://docs.rs/divan/0.1.0/divan/struct.Bencher.html#method.bench"><code>bench</code></a> function cannot be called
if you have already provided inputs.</p>
<p>This is made possible by the fact that the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.unit.html"><code>()</code></a> type does not implement the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Fn.html"><code>Fn</code></a> family of traits. <a href="https://docs.rs/divan/0.1.0/divan/struct.Bencher.html"><code>Bencher</code></a> uses <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.unit.html"><code>()</code></a> as the default for a generic
type until <a href="https://docs.rs/divan/0.1.0/divan/struct.Bencher.html#method.with_inputs"><code>with_inputs</code></a> is called, at which point <a href="https://docs.rs/divan/0.1.0/divan/struct.Bencher.html"><code>Bencher</code></a> uses the
provided <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Fn.html"><code>Fn</code></a> type.</p>
<h4 id="deferred-drop">Deferred Drop</h4>
<p>When values are returned by the benchmarked function, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html"><code>Drop</code></a> destructors
will not run until after the sample is recorded. This is achieved by storing
results in a buffer, which will be dropped after the sample.</p>
<p>If buffering is not done carefully, it could affect the accuracy of benchmarks
by accidentally also <a href="https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/0.5.1/src/bencher.rs#L267-L269">timing buffer capacity checks and
reallocation</a>.
To ensure accurate benchmarks, Divan implements this <em>very efficiently</em> by
<a href="https://github.com/nvzqz/divan/blob/v0.1.0/src/bench/mod.rs#L904-L929">iterating over a preallocated
slice</a> of
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/union.MaybeUninit.html"><code>MaybeUninit</code></a> “drop slots” to store outputs in.</p>
<p>Only one of the following functions will benchmark <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.LinkedList.html"><code>LinkedList</code></a> deallocation

<p>Note that if <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.needs_drop.html"><code>needs_drop</code></a> for the output is false (e.g. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.unit.html"><code>()</code></a>, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.i32.html"><code>i32</code></a>,

The resulting access pattern is monotonically increasing, which is easily
prefetched into cache.</p>
<h4 id="efficient-enums">Efficient Enums</h4>
<p>Divan internally uses an
<a href="https://github.com/nvzqz/divan/blob/v0.1.0/src/time/timestamp/mod.rs#L42-L56"><code>UntaggedTimestamp</code></a>
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.union.html"><code>union</code></a>, which can be either an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/struct.Instant.html"><code>Instant</code></a> or a <a href="#cpu-timestamp">CPU timestamp</a>. The variant
is kept track of by an external
<a href="https://github.com/nvzqz/divan/blob/v0.1.0/src/time/timer.rs#L165-L174"><code>TimerKind</code></a>
instance, unlike a conventional <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.enum.html"><code>enum</code></a> which internally stores the variant
tag. Externally storing the variant tag is a micro-optimization to prevent extra
time spent on storing the timestamp during the sample.</p>
<h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2>
<p>Divan has many opportunities for features. Future versions will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better output options:
<ul>
<li>HTML output with interactive graphs. Hovering over a graph will reveal
data points.</li>
<li>Machine-readable output like JSON and CSV.</li>
<li>Colored terminal output with customizable themes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved statistics:
<ul>
<li>Baseline comparison.</li>
<li>Sample variance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More profiling tools:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/trait.GlobalAlloc.html"><code>GlobalAlloc</code></a> profiling similar to <a href="https://docs.rs/dhat"><code>dhat-rs</code></a>,
but with minimal performance impact.</li>
<li>Custom profiler plugins like <a href="https://docs.rs/pprof"><code>pprof</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Async <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html"><code>Future</code></a> benchmarking to measure server and client performance.</li>
<li>Registering benchmarks without attribute macros to support more platforms like
WebAssembly.</li>
<li>Runtime argument values, as an alternative to const generics. Const parameters
are great for benchmarking different array sizes, but they have <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95174">limited type
support</a> and greatly increase
benchmark compile times.</li>
</ul>

But other scientists “are still a little bit in the dark about the extent of the problem”, David says. He decided he needed some data.</p><p>The independent biologist in Pontypridd, UK, spent the best part of several months poring over hundreds of papers in one journal, looking for any with duplicated images. Then he ran the same papers through an artificial-intelligence (AI) tool. Working at two to three times David’s speed, the software found almost all of the 63 suspect papers that he had identified — and 41 that he’d missed. David described the exercise last month in a preprint<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>, one of the first published comparison of human versus machine for finding doctored images.</p><p>The findings come as academic publishers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03807-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03807-6" data-track-category="body text link">reckon with the problem of image manipulation</a> in scientific papers. In a 2016 study<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01363-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01363-z" data-track-category="body text link">renowned image-forensics specialist Elisabeth Bik</a>, based in San Francisco, California, and her colleagues reported that almost 4% of papers she had visually scanned in 40 biomedical-science journals contained inappropriately duplicated images.</p><p>Not all image manipulation is done with nefarious intent. Authors might tinker with images by accident, for aesthetic reasons or to make a figure more understandable. But journals and others would like to catch images with alterations that cross the line, whatever the authors’ motivation. And now they are turning to AI for help.</p><h2>Fraud busters</h2><p>Some 200 universities, publishers and scientific societies already rely on Imagetwin, the tool that David used for his study. The software compares images in a paper with more than 25 million images from other publications — the largest such database in the image-integrity world, according to Imagetwin‘s developers.</p><p>Bik has been using Imagetwin regularly to supplement her own skills and calls it her “standard tool”, although she emphasizes that the AI has weaknesses as well as strengths — for instance, it can miss duplications in images with low contrast. She and David both get free access to the software from ImageTwin AI, the Vienna-based company that developed Imagetwin, and provide feedback to the developers.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Some publishers have turned to other AI tools. Journals published by the American Association for Cancer Research in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, screen papers with the AI tool Proofig. Frontiers in Lausanne, Switzerland, has developed its own software to check papers for its family of journals. A spokesperson for Springer Nature, which publishes <i>Nature</i>, says that the company is “continuing to explore and develop tools for image checking”. (<i>Nature</i>’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher.)</p><p>Part of the draw of Imagetwin, specialists say, is that it looks for duplications in two ways. The software makes “something like a fingerprint” for every image in a paper, says Patrick Starke, one of its developers. It then scans the entire paper for repeats of that fingerprint. It also scans its large database to see whether that fingerprint appears in past papers — a process that takes only five to ten seconds.</p><h2>A long slog</h2><p>For his study, David sifted through more than 700 papers with relevant images published between 2014 and 2023 in <i>Toxicology Reports</i>, a journal he chose in part because it contains a lot of pictures and in part because in 2021, the journal’s publisher, Elsevier in Amsterdam, added an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221475002100216X" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221475002100216X" data-track-category="body text link">expression of concern</a> to an entire special issue of the journal.</p><p>After checking the papers visually, David gave the AI a go and found that it worked “much faster than me very carefully staring at images for a long time”, although it did miss four papers that he had flagged. All told, there were duplications in around 16% of the analysed papers with relevant images.</p><p>That’s considerably higher than the 4% Bik calculated, but she says David’s figure isn’t surprising. In her analysis, individual journals had duplications in between 0.3% and 12% of their papers, with higher-impact journals tending to have fewer duplications.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>It is “entirely plausible” that 16% of a journal’s images could include duplications, agrees Jana Christopher, an image-integrity analyst at FEBS Press in Heidelberg, Germany, who has free access to Imagetwin and uses it along with other software. In her work looking over papers before they are published, Christopher flags about one-third for further investigation.</p><p>David posted his study on the preprint server bioRxiv on 5 September. It has not yet been peer reviewed. An Elsevier spokesperson says: “We are aware of the preprint and have launched an internal investigation that is under way at this time.” The editor-in-chief of <i>Toxicology Reports</i>, Lawrence Lash, says he has nothing to add to that statement.</p><p>Bik finds Imagetwin especially useful for “complex figures with lots of panels”. It can perform nearly instant scans of Images that can take her more than half an hour to dissect on her own.</p><p>“It’s really nice to have a software as a second pair of eyes,” agrees Christopher. But like Bik, she says Imagetwin has its shortcomings. “I often find additional [problems] that aren’t duplications and even duplications that the software didn’t flag,” Christopher says.</p><h2>Part of the process</h2><p>The end goal, Christopher says, is to incorporate AI tools such as Imagetwin into the paper-review process, just as many publishers routinely use software to scan text for plagiarism. But AI on its own isn’t enough. “You have to use your own expertise and question these things. None of the flags you receive [from Imagetwin] are a definite ‘This is fraud,’” she says.</p><p>Starke says that universities are using Imagetwin to review papers that their faculty members are submitting to journals. He declined to provide detailed numbers or to name any of the software’s users.</p><p>Christopher hopes that the roll-out of more AI tools could democratize the ability for journals to screen papers. “I think we need to shed the idea that it’s a luxury — it actually adds value to the journal.”</p>

<p>Ural Airlines is preparing to fly an Airbus A320 out of the field in which it made an emergency landing last month. It will be the first time that any such recovery has been tried, yet many questions remain about how it ended up in the field to start with and whether the recovery operation can be successful.</p>

<p>Russian carrier <a href="https://simpleflying.com/tag/ural-airlines/">Ural Airlines </a>has confirmed its plans to attempt to fly a stranded<a href="https://simpleflying.com/tag/airbus-a320/"> Airbus A320</a> from the field in which it <a href="https://simpleflying.com/russian-airbus-a320-makes-forced-landing-in-a-field/">performed an emergency landing</a> on September 12, 2023. The airline has taken to its <a href="https://t.me/uralairlines_official/653" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Telegram channel</a> this week to post various photos of preparatory work taking place on the plane, along with a comment that various options are available.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-there-an-a320-in-a-field"> Why is there an A320 in a field? </h2>
<p>The 17-year-old Ural Airlines A320 with registration RA-73805 was operating flight U6 1383, a domestic flight from Sochi (AER) to Omsk (OMS), Russia, when it suffered a reported hydraulic failure on the approach to its final destination. The flight had 165 passengers and crew onboard.</p>
<!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":1044} --><!-- Zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- No ads allowed! --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":0} -->
<p>Following the execution of a missed approach, or 'go around,' the crew climbed the aircraft back up to 18,000ft and subsequently elected to divert to Novosibirsk Airport (OVB), which has a longer runway that would facilitate a landing possibly without the use of brakes and spoilers, among other systems.</p>

<p>The crew's initial calculations indicated that the aircraft would have had enough fuel to reach the alternative airport. However, with the crew being unable to retract the main landing gear doors due to the hydraulic failure this increased the fuel consumption during the diversion, an issue exacerbated by stronger-than-predicted headwinds during the flight.</p>

<p>After realizing they could not make it to Novosibirsk, the crew landed in the wheat field with the landing gear extended. The location is reportedly on the outskirts of Kamenka, a rural village about 180 km (110 mi) from Novosibirsk.</p>

<h2 id="possibly-wider-issues-involved"> Possibly wider issues involved </h2>
<p>It has been widely speculated that the incident occurred due to Russian airlines having difficulty sourcing spares for their civil aircraft due to Western sanctions imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. However, Ural Airlines has denied facing such an issue or using any non-certified spare parts to keep its fleet in the air.</p>

<p>A similar incident occurred in August 2019 when another Ural Airlines-operated aircraft <a href="https://simpleflying.com/ural-a321-birdstrike-cornfield/">landed in a cornfield near Moscow</a>. The Airbus A321 involved in that incident suffered a dual-engine failure following a bird strike. In that case, the aircraft sustained substantial damage and was eventually disassembled in the field where it landed.</p>

<p>Thankfully, all passengers and crew survived, and the captain was considered a hero. However, like the more recent incident, experts suggested that the pilots could have handled the situation differently and that, in both cases, better decision-making at crucial points in both flights could have avoided the off-airport landings.</p>

<p>An attempt to fly a large passenger plane out of a wheat field has never been attempted. Given this to be the case, the aviation world is watching keenly to see how the recovery operation progresses.</p>

<p>Any attempt at a take-off would be fraught with difficulties and dangers, even with minimal fuel and with the seats (and possibly other parts of the interior) removed. Firstly, the engines could ingest foreign objects, potentially causing damage and a possible loss of power.</p>

                <figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/DNS-Incident-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"></figure><p>On 4 October 2023, Cloudflare experienced DNS resolution problems starting at 07:00 UTC and ending at 11:00 UTC. Some users of 1.1.1.1 or products like WARP, Zero Trust, or third party DNS resolvers which use 1.1.1.1 may have received SERVFAIL DNS responses to valid queries. We’re very sorry for this outage. This outage was an internal software error and not the result of an attack. In this blog, we’re going to talk about what the failure was, why it occurred, and what we’re doing to make sure this doesn’t happen again. </p><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>In the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">Domain Name System (DNS)</a>, every domain name exists within a DNS zone. The zone is a collection of domain names and host names that are controlled together. For example, Cloudflare is responsible for the domain name cloudflare.com, which we say is in the “cloudflare.com” zone. The .com top-level domain (TLD) is owned by a third party and is in the “com” zone. It gives directions on how to reach cloudflare.com. Above all of the TLDs is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_root_zone">the root zone</a>, which gives <a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db">directions on how to reach TLDs</a>. This means that the root zone is important in being able to resolve all other domain names. Like other important parts of the DNS, <a href="https://www.iana.org/dnssec/procedures">the root zone is signed with DNSSEC</a>, which means the root zone itself contains cryptographic signatures.</p><p>The root zone is published on <a href="https://root-servers.org/">the root servers</a>, but it is also common for DNS operators to <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8806">retrieve and retain a copy of the root zone automatically</a> so that in the event that the root servers cannot be reached, the information in the root zone is still available. Cloudflare’s recursive DNS infrastructure takes this approach as it also makes the resolution process faster. New versions of the root zone are normally published twice a day. 1.1.1.1 has a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/big-pineapple-intro/">WebAssembly app</a> called static_zone running on top of the main DNS logic that serves those new versions when they are available.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/image2-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="951" height="604"></figure><h2 id="what-happened">What happened</h2><p>On 21 September, as part of <a href="https://blog.verisign.com/security/root-zone-zonemd/">a known and planned change in root zone management</a>, a new resource record type was included in the root zones for the first time. The new resource record is named <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8976.html">ZONEMD</a>, and is in effect a checksum for the contents of the root zone.</p><p>The root zone is retrieved by software running in Cloudflare’s core network. It is subsequently redistributed to Cloudflare’s data centers around the world. After the change, the root zone containing the ZONEMD record continued to be retrieved and distributed as normal. However, the 1.1.1.1 resolver systems that make use of that data had problems parsing the ZONEMD record. Because zones must be loaded and served in their entirety, the system’s failure to parse ZONEMD meant the new versions of the root zone were not used in Cloudflare’s resolver systems. Some of the servers hosting Cloudflare's resolver infrastructure failed over to querying the DNS root servers directly on a request-by-request basis when they did not receive the new root zone. However, others continued to rely on the known working version of the root zone still available in their memory cache, which was the version pulled on 21 September before the change.</p><p>On 4 October 2023 at 07:00 UTC, the DNSSEC signatures in the version of the root zone from 21 September expired. Because there was no newer version that the Cloudflare resolver systems were able to use, some of Cloudflare’s resolver systems stopped being able to validate DNSSEC signatures and as a result started sending error responses (SERVFAIL). The rate at which Cloudflare resolvers generated SERVFAIL responses grew by 12%. The diagrams below illustrate the progression of the failure and how it became visible to users.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/image3-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1337" height="1999"></figure><h2 id="incident-timeline-and-impact">Incident timeline and impact</h2><p><strong>21 September 6:30 UTC</strong>: Last successful pull of the root zone.<br><strong>4 October 7:00 UTC</strong>: DNSSEC signatures in the root zone obtained on 21 September expired causing an increase in SERVFAIL responses to client queries.<br><strong>7:57</strong>: First external reports of unexpected SERVFAILs started coming in.<br><strong>8:03</strong>: Internal Cloudflare incident declared.<br><strong>8:50</strong>: Initial attempt made at stopping 1.1.1.1 from serving responses using the stale root zone file with an override rule.<br><strong>10:30</strong>: Stopped 1.1.1.1 from preloading the root zone file entirely.<br><strong>10:32</strong>: Responses returned to normal.<br><strong>11:02</strong>: Incident closed.</p><p>This below chart shows the timeline of impact along with the percentage of DNS queries that returned with a SERVFAIL error:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/image1-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1431" height="414"></figure><p>We expect a baseline volume of SERVFAIL errors for regular traffic during normal operation. Usually that percentage sits at around 3%. These SERVFAILs can be caused by legitimate issues in the DNSSEC chain, failures to connect to authoritative servers, authoritative servers taking too long to respond, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/unwrap-the-servfail/">and many others</a>. During the incident the amount of SERVFAILs peaked at 15% of total queries, although the impact was not evenly distributed around the world and was mainly concentrated in our larger data centers like Ashburn, Virginia; Frankfurt, Germany; and Singapore.</p><h2 id="why-this-incident-happened">Why this incident happened</h2><h4 id="why-parsing-the-zonemd-record-failed">Why parsing the ZONEMD record failed</h4><p>DNS has a binary format for storing resource records. In this binary format the type of the resource record (TYPE) &nbsp;is stored as a 16-bit integer. The type of resource record determines how the resource data (RDATA) is parsed. When the record type is 1, this means it is an A record, and the RDATA can be parsed as an IPv4 address. Record type 28 is an AAAA record, whose RDATA can be parsed as an IPv6 address instead. When a parser runs into an unknown resource type it won’t know how to parse its RDATA, but fortunately it doesn’t have to: the RDLENGTH field indicates how long the RDATA field is, allowing the parser to treat it as an opaque data element.</p><figure><pre><code>                                   1  1  1  1  1  1

</code></pre><figcaption><a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt">RFC 1035</a></figcaption></figure><p>The reason static_zone didn’t support the new ZONEMD record is because up until now we had chosen to distribute the root zone internally in its presentation format, rather than in the binary format. When looking at the text representation for a few resource records we can see there is a lot more variation in how different records are presented.</p><figure><pre><code>.			86400	IN	SOA	a.root-servers.net. nstld.verisign-grs.com. 2023100400 1800 900 604800 86400

</code></pre><figcaption>Example records taken from <a href="https://www.internic.net/domain/root.zone">https://www.internic.net/domain/root.zone</a></figcaption></figure><p>When we run into an unknown resource record it’s not always easy to know how to handle it. Because of this, the library we use to parse the root zone at the edge does not make an attempt at doing so, and instead returns a parser error.</p><h3 id="why-a-stale-version-of-the-root-zone-was-used">Why a stale version of the root zone was used</h3><p>The static_zone app, tasked with loading and parsing the root zone for the purpose of serving the root zone locally (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7706">RFC 7706</a>), stores the latest version in memory. When a new version is published it parses it and, when successfully done so, drops the old version. However, as parsing failed the static_zone app never switched to a newer version, and instead continued using the old version indefinitely. When the 1.1.1.1 service is first started the static_zone app does not have an existing version in memory. When it tries to parse the root zone it fails in doing so, but because it does not have an older version of the root zone to fall back on, it falls back on querying the root servers directly for incoming requests.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/image5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1999" height="1417"></figure><h3 id="why-the-initial-attempt-at-disabling-staticzone-didn%E2%80%99t-work">Why the initial attempt at disabling static_zone didn’t work</h3><p>Initially we tried to disable the static_zone app through override rules, a mechanism that allows us to programmatically change some behavior of 1.1.1.1. The rule we deployed was:</p><pre><code>phase = pre-cache set-tag rec_disable_static
</code></pre><p>For any incoming request this rule adds the tag rec_disable_static to the request. Inside the static_zone app we check for this tag and, if it’s set, we do not return a response from the cached, static root zone. However, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/big-pineapple-intro/">to improve cache performance</a> queries are sometimes forwarded to another node if the current node can’t find the response in its own cache. Unfortunately, the rec_disable_static tag is not included in the queries being forwarded to other nodes, which caused the static_zone app to continue replying with stale information until we eventually disabled the app entirely.</p><h3 id="why-the-impact-was-partial">Why the impact was partial</h3><p>Cloudflare regularly performs rolling reboots of the servers that host our services for tasks like kernel updates that can only take effect after a full system restart. At the time of this outage, resolver server instances that were restarted between the ZONEMD change and the DNSSEC invalidation did not contribute to impact. If they had restarted during this two-week period, they would have failed to load the root zone on startup and fallen back to resolving by sending DNS queries to root servers instead. In addition, the resolver uses a technique called serve stale (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8767">RFC 8767</a>) with the purpose of being able to continue to serve popular records from a potentially stale cache to limit the impact. A record is considered to be stale once the TTL amount of seconds has passed since the record was retrieved from upstream. &nbsp;This prevented a total outage; impact was mainly felt in our largest data centers which had many servers that had not restarted the 1.1.1.1 service in that timeframe.</p><p>This incident had widespread impact, and we take the availability of our services very seriously. We have identified several areas of improvement and will continue to work on uncovering any other gaps that could cause a recurrence.</p><p>Here is what we are working on immediately:</p><p><strong>Visibility</strong>: We’re adding alerts to notify when static_zone serves a stale root zone file. It should not have been the case that serving a stale root zone file went unnoticed for as long as it did. If we had been monitoring this better, with the caching that exists, there would have been no impact. It is our goal to protect our customers and their users from upstream changes.</p><p><strong>Resilience:</strong> We will re-evaluate how we ingest and distribute the root zone internally. Our ingestion and distribution pipelines should handle new RRTYPEs seamlessly, and any brief interruption to the pipeline should be invisible to end users.</p><p><strong>Testing:</strong> Despite having tests in place around this problem, including tests related to unreleased changes in parsing the new ZONEMD records, we did not adequately test what happens when the root zone fails to parse. We will improve our test coverage and the related processes.</p><p><strong>Architecture</strong>: We should not use stale copies of the root zone past a certain point. While it’s certainly possible to continue to use stale root zone data for a limited amount of time, past a certain point there are unacceptable operational risks. We will take measures to ensure that the lifetime of cached root zone data is better managed as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8806">RFC 8806: Running a Root Server Local to a Resolver</a>.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>We are deeply sorry that this incident happened. There is one clear message from this incident: do not ever assume that something is not going to change! &nbsp;Many modern systems are built with a long chain of libraries that are pulled into the final executable, each one of those may have bugs or may not be updated early enough for programs to operate correctly when changes in input happen. We understand how important it is to have good testing in place that allows detection of regressions and systems and components that fail gracefully on changes to input. We understand that we need to always assume that “format” changes in the most critical systems of the internet (DNS and BGP) are going to have an impact.</p><p>We have a lot to follow up on internally and are working around the clock to make sure something like this does not happen again.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Modern code generation tools use AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), to generate functional and complete code. While such tools are becoming popular and widely available for developers, using these tools is often accompanied by security challenges. Therefore, it is important to assess the quality of the generated code, especially in terms of its security. Researchers have recently explored various aspects of code generation tools, including security. However, many open questions about the security of the generated code require further investigation, especially the security issues of automatically generated code in the wild. To this end, we conducted an empirical study by analyzing the security weaknesses in code snippets generated by GitHub Copilot that are found as part of publicly available projects hosted on GitHub. The goal is to investigate the types of security issues and their scale in real-world scenarios (rather than crafted scenarios). To this end, we identified 435 code snippets generated by Copilot from publicly available projects. We then conducted extensive security analysis to identify Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) instances in these code snippets. The results show that (1) 35.8% of Copilot generated code snippets contain CWEs, and those issues are spread across multiple languages, (2) the security weaknesses are diverse and related to 42 different CWEs, in which CWE-78: OS Command Injection, CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values, and CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions occurred the most frequently, and (3) among the 42 CWEs identified, 11 of those belong to the currently recognized 2022 CWE Top-25. Our findings confirm that developers should be careful when adding code generated by Copilot (and similar AI code generation tools) and should also run appropriate security checks as they accept the suggested code.

<p dir="auto">These are different ways to consume the events:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>SC2EventIterator</code> collects both TrackerEvents and GameEvents. Events are provided as they appear, be them Tracker or Game</li>
<li><code>TrackerEventIterator</code> allows consuming only Tracker Events</li>
<li><code>GameEventIterator</code> allows consuming only the Game Events</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Event changes transist a minimal state machine that updates:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>names</li>
<li>positions</li>
<li>Attack events</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The iterators returns a tuple <code>(SC2EventType, UnitChangeHint)</code>
The first item contains the event itself as it was deserialized from the SC2Replay.
The second item hints the consumers of the iterator about the changes performed to the state machine due to this event.
For example, units may have been deleted, added, changed position, etc.</p>

<p dir="auto">In the arrow file generation, sha256 digest is used to detect duplication/etc.
This inflates the size of the rows. Even tho it's slightly less than long directory names.
Perhaps using short rev-parse for sha256 may be better, find something like 7-characters unique combinations
And use that instead of the long sha256 form.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-version-compatibility" dir="auto"><a href="#version-compatibility">version compatibility.</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">After a bit of testing, it seems most of the types are compatible between versions, so only when they differ would they make part of the protocol version.
Since I started this exercise on protocol87702, all types would be relative to it. That is, most modules would re-use protocol87702 as much as possible.
This explains why old-er versions such as 75689 would still reference 87702 as much as possible.</p>
<p dir="auto">The generator above thus would show example code <code>S2ProtoResult</code> created in favour of unwrapping/panic'ing.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-generating-protocol-specific-code" dir="auto"><a href="#generating-protocol-specific-code">Generating protocol-specific code:</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">The rust code for the protocols versions available were generated using:
This would now be compared with ./src/versions/protocol99999.template file and from there we can analyze what has changed.
Notably, the number of bits used for the Chat Message is still miscalculated to 3 so it needs to be dismissed.</p>
