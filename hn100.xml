  <h3>Semantic, minimal, zero dependencies. ~8KB CSS and JS.</h3>

  <p>
    Oat is an ultra-lightweight HTML + CSS, semantic UI component library with zero dependencies.
    No framework, build, or dev complexity. Just include the tiny CSS and JS files and you are good to go building
    decent looking web applications with most commonly needed components and elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Semantic tags and attributes are styled contextually out of the box without classes, forcing best practices, and reducing
    markup class pollution. A few dynamic components are WebComponents and use minimal JavaScript.

      <h3>Light like an oat flake</h3>
    </header>
    <p><strong>6KB</strong> CSS, <strong>2.2KB</strong> JS, minified + gzipped.</p>
    <p>That's it.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <header>
      <h3>Zero dependencies</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Fully-standalone with no dependencies on any JS or CSS frameworks or libraries.
      No Node.js ecosystem garbage or bloat.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <header>
      <h3>Semantic HTML</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Native elements like <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> and
      semantic attributes like <code>role="button"</code> are styled directly. No classes.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <header>
      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Semantic HTML and ARIA roles are used (and forced in many places) throughout.
      Proper keyboard navigation support for all components and elements.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <header>
      <h3>Easy customization</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Easily customize the overall theme by overriding a handful of CSS variables. <code>data-theme="dark"</code> on body
      automatically uses the bundled dark theme.</p>
  </article>

<section>
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>
    This was made after the unending frustration with the over-engineered bloat, complexity, and dependency-hell of pretty much every Javascript UI library and framework out there. Done with the continuous PTSD of rug-pulls and lockins of the Node.js ecosystem trash.
    <sup><a href="https://nadh.in/blog/javascript-ecosystem-software-development-are-a-hot-mess/">[1]</a></sup>
    I've published this, in case other Node.js ecosystem trauma victims find it useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal is a simple, minimal, vanilla, standards-based UI library that I can use in my own projects for the long term without having to worry about Javascript ecosystem trash. Long term because it's just simple vanilla CSS and JS.
    The look and feel are influenced by the shadcn aesthetic.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last July was the cut-off date for major digital platforms to comply with the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA). In an attempt to block access between minors and material deemed “harmful” by the government, platforms like Reddit, Spotify, and X began tougher age verification for their users, such as facial scans or, in some cases, even needing to see government ID. At the top of those <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-age-verification-ai-hack-nitro-boycott-2000667358">stumbling to do so was Discord</a>, whose system is not only </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/someone-has-already-made-a-free-in-browser-3d-model-to-bypass-discord-age-verification-that-works-on-any-potato-computer/"><span>easy to game</span></a><span> but also not impossible to compromise, with one major security breach </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/oct/09/hack-age-verification-firm-discord-users-id-photos"><span>exposing some 70,000 users’ IDs shortly after</span></a><span>. Now Discord is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-will-force-you-to-scan-your-face-or-id-to-unlock-all-of-its-features-2000666884"><span>looking to enforce age verification globally</span></a><span>. A firm Discord at one point worked with to do so may be even more controversial than the decision itself.</span></p> <p><span>While the roll-out is aimed for March, </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i><span> reports</span></a><span> that some Discord users have already been prompted for new age verification, this time using the third-party service Persona. Started in 2018, Persona develops identity detection and anti-fraud technologies. They’ve been having an absolute field day since the OSA, being implemented to verify user ID across Reddit and Roblox. One sticking point, however, is who’s backing the company: Peter Thiel, the cofounder of ICE-approved surveillance firm Palantir.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">managed to catch it <a href="https://t.co/Yyu0FaoDJ7">pic.twitter.com/Yyu0FaoDJ7</a></p> <p>— Folf (@itsfolf) <a href="https://twitter.com/itsfolf/status/2021749585111069152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>One of Persona’s biggest investors is the Founders Fund, valuing the company at $1.5 billion and </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion"><span>rallying $150 million towards it in 2021</span></a><span>. The Founders Fund began in the mid-2000s and made key early investments in the likes of SpaceX, AirBNB, OpenAI and Polymarket. All your favorite tech things “disrupting” the modern world. And who would unleash such a monetary power unto civilization? Why, none other than your friend and mine, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hulk-hogan-sex-tape-gawker-lawsuit-kotaku-go-media-1851787000">the anti-humanist, antichrist-awaiting Thiel</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Thiel, of course, is known for many things. A co-founder of PayPal, Thiel is now more closely affiliated with Palantir, a company specializing in digital surveillance and exploiting user information. Palantir, named after the crystal balls that allow communication across Middle-earth in <em>The </em><em>Lord of the Rings</em>,&nbsp;has been around since 2003 but has kept plenty busy lately. </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/"><i><span>404</span></i><span> uncovered</span></a><span> how the company has been developing ELITE, an instrument to monitor user information for the purpose of conducting ICE raids. Elsewhere, the recent, massive disclosure of Epstein emails had </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/epstein-files-tech-elites-gates-thiel-musk/"><span>reoccurring correspondence</span></a><span> between the world’s most active user information broker and the world’s most famous sex trafficker. The two discussed the lawsuit to <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/">end</a> </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"><i><span>Gawker</span></i></a><span><a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"> and how to best balkanize the planet</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Having the Founders Fund so close to expanded data-capturing across Discord, one of the more private places to have a public conversation online, </span><a href="https://piunikaweb.com/2026/02/12/discord-uk-age-verification-persona-vendor-shift/"><span>has made users a little itchy</span></a><span>. The platform has not been entirely clear about how it aims to rapidly expand its age verification process, stating a mix of mandatory scanning but also </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/discord-clarifies-it-is-not-requiring-everyone-to-complete-a-face-scan-or-upload-an-id-and-will-confirm-your-age-group-using-information-we-already-have/"><span>using existing user data to guesstimate</span></a><span> if a user is in their 30s (which is great news for everyone who communicates through </span><i><span>Simpsons</span></i><span> quotes). </span></p>

 <p><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord"><span>In an official update</span></a><span>, Discord suggested users who encountered prompts from Persona are part of “an experiment” and that the information will only be stored for seven days. How the tech will be used in the long term is yet to be known. When asked for comment, Discord told <em>Kotaku</em> its work with Persona was part of a “limited test” which has since been concluded.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Regardless, I will see you on the forums.</span></p>

                <p><span>Welcome</span></p><hr>
<p>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nIbn3vvvMc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p><p>

Flashpoint Archive is a community effort to preserve games and animations from the web.</p><p>

Internet history and culture is important, and the web is evolving at such a rapid pace that what might be commonplace today could be obsolete tomorrow. This project is dedicated to preserving as many experiences from these platforms as possible, so that they aren't lost to time. Since December 2017, <a href="https://flashpointproject.github.io/flashpoint-database/statistics/">over 200,000 games and animations</a> have been preserved across more than a hundred browser plugins and web technologies.</p><p>

In addition to our preservation efforts, we also provide a highly flexible software package for reliable navigation and playback of preserved content. Among the software that powers Flashpoint is <a href="https://github.com/FlashpointProject/launcher">a fully-featured launcher</a> that acts as a frontend for the collection, <a href="https://github.com/FlashpointProject/FlashpointProxy">a proxy</a> that tricks games into thinking they're running on the live web, and <a href="https://github.com/FlashpointProject/FlashpointSecureTools">a sandbox</a> that allows for secure playback of plugin-enabled content - all of which are <a href="https://flashpointarchive.org/source">open-source software</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://flashpointarchive.org/images/launcher.png"><img src="https://flashpointarchive.org/images/launcher_thumb.png"></a>
</p><p>

The project <a href="https://flashpointarchive.org/news#starting-date">was originally started</a> by BlueMaxima in an attempt to outrun the disappearance of webgames prior to the death of Flash. It has since evolved into a major undertaking involving hundreds of community contributors from around the world, encompassing both games and animations created for numerous internet plugins, frameworks, and standards.</p><p>

Flashpoint Archive operates as non-profit with the goal of furthering efforts in the preservation and accessibility of games, animations and other digital interactive experiences from the web. If you wish to support us or find out more about how we're funded and where these funds are spent, please use the Donate button in the left sidebar or visit our <a href="https://opencollective.com/flashpointarchive">Open Collective page</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>For this year's <a href="https://ilovefs.org/">"I love Free Software Day"</a> I
would like to thank the maintainers of Free Software documentation, and
here especially the maintainers of the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">ArchWiki</a>. Maintainers in general, and
maintainers of documentation most of the time get way too little
recognition for their contributions to software freedom.</p>
<p><img alt="Myself, Arch Project Leader Levente, ArchWiki maintainer Ferdinand, and FSFE's vice president Heiki at FOSDEM 2025 after I handed them over some hacker chocolate" src="https://k7r.eu/i-love-the-work-of-the-archwiki-maintainers/ilovefs-archwiki-reduced.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Myself, Arch Project Leader Levente, ArchWiki maintainer Ferdinand
(Alad), and FSFE's vice president Heiki at FOSDEM 2026 after I handed
them over some hacker chocolate.</em></p>
<p>The ArchWiki is a resource, I myself and many people around me regularly
consult - no matter if it is actually about Arch or another Free Software
distribution. There are countless times, when I read articles there to
get a better understanding of the tools I daily use, like e-mail
programs, editors, or all kinds of window managers I used over time. It
helped me to discover some handy features or configuration tips that
were difficult for me to find in the documentation of the software
itself.</p>
<p>Whenever I run into issues setting up a GNU/Linux distribution for
myself or family and friends, the ArchWiki had my back!</p>
<p>Whenever I want to better understand a software, the ArchWiki is most
often the first page I end up consulting.</p>
<p><em>You are one of the pearls of the internet!</em> Or in Edward Snowden's
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Is it just me, or have search results become absolute garbage for
  basically every site? It's nearly impossible to discover useful
  information these days (outside the ArchWiki). "
  <a href="https://x.com/Snowden/status/1460666075033575425">https://x.com/Snowden/status/1460666075033575425</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you, to all the ArchWiki contributors for gathering all the
knowledge to help others in society to better understand technology and for
the ArchWiki maintainers to ensure the long term availability and
reliability of this crucial resource.</p>
<p>If you also appreciated the work of the ArchWiki maintainers for our
society, tell them as well, and I encourage you to make a <a href="https://archlinux.org/donate/">donation to
Arch</a>.</p>
<p>PS: Thanks also to Morton for connecting me with Ferdinand and Levente
at FOSDEM.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
    This is a "byte" post. It may not be as detailed as other posts.
  </p><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I like things that are strange and a bit obscure. It’s a habit of mine, and a lot of this blog is to document things I haven’t heard of before, because I wanted to learn about them. I mean, jeez, I’m certainly not writing blog posts about <a href="https://nicole.express/2026/put-your-clothes-back-on.html">strip </a><a href="https://nicole.express/2026/spooky-ghost-stories.html">mahjong</a> because the people demand it. But I can’t stop seeing misinformation everywhere, and I have to say something. This post is just a rant.</p>

<h2 id="phantasy-star-fukkokuban"><em>Phantasy Star Fukkokuban</em></h2>

<p>This is <em>Phantasy Star Fukkokuban</em>, a Japanese Sega Genesis game released in 1994 to commemorate the release of <em>Phantasy Star IV</em> by re-releasing the original. It has an interesting component: it is the Master System game, just packaged into a Genesis cart. The PCB wires the Genesis lines the same way your Power Base Converter would. My guess is the reason for this is because the Master System wasn’t very popular in Japan, and <em>Phantasy Star IV</em> tied together the whole series with a lot of tiebacks to the first one in particular.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/2sega/fuk.jpeg" title="You know, Sega could've included the FM soundtrack, if they had shelled out for a YM2413 in the cart" alt="Phantasy Star Fukkokuban, which uses the Phantasy Star box art on a Japanese cartridge shell."></p>

<p>As a Master System game disguised as a Genesis one, this game is technically interesting. Some Genesis consoles can’t play Master System games, and those ones can’t play this game either. Also, I love the <em>Phantasy Star</em> series; even if 2 is my favorite. This makes this cartridge a perfect subject for my interest, so I’ve talked about it before and will talk about it again. In fact, I have a post I’m working on where I mention it.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ai-is-bad/ps1987.png" title="taken on my mega drive 2" alt="Phantasy Star title screen. (C) SEGA 1987"></p>

<p>So there I was, writing a blog post, and wanted to look up the release date. The first result I found in DuckDuckGo, my search engine?</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ai-is-bad/results.png" title="all results are personalized these days I assume" alt="DuckDuckGo search results. First, GameFAQs. Second, TCRF. Third, Press Start Gaming. An abandonware site is at the bottom"></p>

<p><a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/genesis/570415-phantasy-star-fukkokuban">GameFAQs</a> is at the top; a titan since the 1990’s. The second result is <a href="https://tcrf.net/Phantasy_Star">The Cutting Room Floor</a>, a wiki much beloved by myself. And then the third result is <a href="https://pressstartgaming.com/phantasy-star-fukkokuban-a-classic-reimagined/">“Press Start Gaming”</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ai-is-bad/start.png" title="finally, a console for my horrifying NES-Genesis hybrid" alt="Welcome to Press Start Gaming, your ultimate destination for gaming and tech enthusiasts! Founded with a passion for exploring the ever-evolving worlds of gaming and technology, we aim to deliver high-quality reviews, insightful articles, and the latest industry news to help you stay informed and inspired. Whether you’re a casual gamer, a tech aficionado, or a seasoned pro, we have something for everyone."></p>

<p>And here’s a thing about me. I want to trust new websites. I have a bias towards clicking on articles from sites I don’t know, because to be quite honest, I’ve read the TCRF page on <em>Phantasy Star</em> a thousand times. How else do you learn something new?</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ai-is-bad/ps1988.png" title="ALSO taken on my mega drive 2! what a twist" alt="Phantasy Star title screen. (C) SEGA 1988"></p>

<p>Also, I clicked it because the headline was “Phantasy Star Fukkokuban: A Classic Reimagined”. Because here’s the thing. It talks about how the graphics were improved:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Phantasy Star Fukkokuban breathes new life into the classic with its updated graphics and sound design. The visual overhaul retains the charm of the original’s 8-bit aesthetics while incorporating modern graphical techniques. Characters and environments are rendered with enhanced detail, vibrant colors, and fluid animations, creating a visually captivating experience.</p>

  <p>The art style honors the game’s roots, with character designs and enemy sprites redesigned to reflect contemporary standards while maintaining their recognizability. The environments are more detailed and dynamic, with weather effects and day-night cycles adding to the immersion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, compare the title screen shots of <em>Phantasy Star</em> above. Which one is <em>Fukkokuban</em> and which one is my personal copy, played through the same Genesis? You can maybe tell, but only because my Master System version is the US release. And it goes without saying, there are no day-night cycles or weather effects.</p>

<p>I should’ve known. The first sentence of the article was “Game data not found,” after all.</p>

<h2 id="and-thats-the-thing">And that’s the thing</h2>

<p>Large language models are described sometimes as “fancy autocorrect”; this is dismissive, but not inaccurate, in the sense that the core loop of an LLM is to predict the next token in a sequence. <em>Phantasy Star Fukkokuban</em> is an obscure title that is likely not well-represented in the training data. But relations do exist:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It knows about <em>Phantasy Star</em>, a very popular game</li>
  <li><em>Fukkokuban</em> (復刻版) means “reprint” or “facsimilie edition”</li>
</ul>

<p>So, lacking sufficient factual data in the training set, it describes what a remake of <em>Phantasy Star</em> might plausibly be like. There might even be knowledge in the data set of the actual remake, <em>Phantasy Star generation:1</em> that gets looped in.</p>

<p>To reproduce this myself, I went to ChatGPT, and asked it <code>Please describe the game "Phantasy Star Fukkokuban". Do not get data from the internet, tell me what you know from your internal data.</code>. And what did I get in response?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Phantasy Star Fukkokuban is not a brand-new entry in the series, but a retro compilation release of the original Phantasy Star, created for the Sega Sega Saturn era…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was a retro compilation release of <em>Phantasy Star</em> for the Sega Saturn in Japan; it’s called <em>Phantasy Star Collection</em>. Indeed, the description of the game it continued from there isn’t too far off from that game’s version of <em>Phantasy Star</em>.</p>

<p>And it’s not just <em>Phantasy Star Fukkokuban</em>. I describe in my post on <a href="https://nicole.express/2026/spooky-ghost-stories.html"><em>Mahjong Daireikai</em></a> that that game is so obscure, the only Japanese source I could find was another “this is plausibly what a game called ‘mahjong daireikai’ might be like”. Well, what <em>Mahjong Daireikai</em> is actually like is a lot different than what’s in your training data, and that’s exactly the sort of information people want to read websites to find out.</p>



<h2 id="is-this-the-end">Is this the end</h2>

<p>And here’s the thing– this blog post can’t do anything about it. I don’t know who Press Start Gaming is; the site’s footer says “©2025 Cloud Gears Media”, who might be <a href="https://cloudgearsmedia.com/">this marketing company</a> (but it might not be! Company names don’t have to be unique globally); Press Start Gaming is almost certainly a tool for making money off of ads and sponsored posts, and posts like the <em>Phantasy Star Fukkokuban</em> misinformation exist mostly to give the site more juice of looking like a real website. If someone goes out and buys a copy of <em>Fukkokuban</em> expecting a new and improved <em>Phantasy Star</em> with better graphics and new sidequests, what do they care? The article wasn’t really meant to provide information.</p>

<p>The trampling of the internet with SEO-mongers predates AI, but what LLMs do is massively increase the ease it can be done, and also hallucinate a ton. If they hired a person to write about <em>Phantasy Star Fukkokuban</em> for pennies, maybe that person would’ve found the <a href="https://segaretro.org/Phantasy_Star#Phantasy_Star_Fukkokuban">Sega Retro</a> page or something and at least grabbed some facts. Now you don’t need to do even that. And no one making these decisions reads <em>Nicole Express</em>, or even cares about actually providing information with their sites. That’s not what they’re for.</p>

<p>Anyways, eventually models will do a better job integrating <em>Nicole Express</em>, and will know more information about <em>Phantasy Star Fukkokuban</em>. And is this the worst thing the AI boom is doing? <a href="https://www.aol.com/news/naacp-threatens-sue-musk-xai-233138040.html">No,</a> <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/groups-threaten-suit-over-xai-223759493.html">not</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/26/tech/openai-chatgpt-teen-suicide-lawsuit">even</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/americans-fear-ai-permanently-displacing-workers-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2025-08-19/">close.</a> Even the <a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/">fully automated hit piece</a> against an open-source developer is probably worse than this.</p>

<p>But it’s a real shame. The commons of the internet are probably already lost, and while I might want to learn new things from new sites, I’ll just have to stick to those with pre-LLM reptuations that I trust. Well, until those sites burn their reputations to make a few extra pennies with AI, like <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@xot/116065688012051690"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> seems to just have. (link goes to a Mastodon thread in lieu of a better source for now)</p>

<p>This post is just a rant. Thanks for listening, at least.</p>

They say it's "built to push the frontier of intelligence and solve modern challenges across science, research, and engineering".</p>
<p>It drew me a <em>really good</em> <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/7e317ebb5cf8e75b2fcec4d0694a8199">SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle</a>! I think this is the best one I've seen so far - here's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">my previous collection</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="This alt text also generated by Gemini 3 Deep Think: A highly detailed, colorful, flat vector illustration with thick dark blue outlines depicting a stylized white pelican riding a bright cyan blue bicycle from left to right across a sandy beige beach with white speed lines indicating forward motion. The pelican features a light blue eye, a pink cheek blush, a massive bill with a vertical gradient from yellow to orange, a backward magenta cap with a cyan brim and a small yellow top button, and a matching magenta scarf blowing backward in the wind. Its white wing, accented with a grey mid-section and dark blue feather tips, reaches forward to grip the handlebars, while its long tan leg and orange foot press down on an orange pedal. Attached to the front handlebars is a white wire basket carrying a bright blue cartoon fish that is pointing upwards and forwards. The bicycle itself has a cyan frame, dark blue tires, striking neon pink inner rims, cyan spokes, a white front chainring, and a dark blue chain. Behind the pelican, a grey trapezoidal pier extends from the sand toward a horizontal band of deep blue ocean water detailed with light cyan wavy lines. A massive, solid yellow-orange semi-circle sun sits on the horizon line, setting directly behind the bicycle frame. The background sky is a smooth vertical gradient transitioning from soft pink at the top to warm golden-yellow at the horizon, decorated with stylized pale peach fluffy clouds, thin white horizontal wind streaks, twinkling four-pointed white stars, and small brown v-shaped silhouettes of distant flying birds." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/gemini-3-deep-think-pelican.png"></p>
<p>(And since it's an FAQ, here's my answer to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/13/training-for-pelicans-riding-bicycles/">What happens if AI labs train for pelicans riding bicycles?</a>)</p>
<p>Since it did so well on my basic <code>Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle</code> I decided to try the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/18/gemini-3/#and-a-new-pelican-benchmark">more challenging version</a> as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Generate an SVG of a California brown pelican riding a bicycle. The bicycle must have spokes and a correctly shaped bicycle frame. The pelican must have its characteristic large pouch, and there should be a clear indication of feathers. The pelican must be clearly pedaling the bicycle. The image should show the full breeding plumage of the California brown pelican.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/154c0cc7b4daed579f6a5e616250ecc8">what I got</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Also described by Gemini 3 Deep Think: A highly detailed, vibrant, and stylized vector illustration of a whimsical bird resembling a mix between a pelican and a frigatebird enthusiastically riding a bright cyan bicycle from left to right across a flat tan and brown surface. The bird leans horizontally over the frame in an aerodynamic racing posture, with thin, dark brown wing-like arms reaching forward to grip the silver handlebars and a single thick brown leg, patterned with white V-shapes, stretching down to press on a black pedal. The bird's most prominent and striking feature is an enormous, vividly bright red, inflated throat pouch hanging beneath a long, straight grey upper beak that ends in a small orange hook. Its head is mostly white with a small pink patch surrounding the eye, a dark brown stripe running down the back of its neck, and a distinctive curly pale yellow crest on the very top. The bird's round, dark brown body shares the same repeating white V-shaped feather pattern as its leg and is accented by a folded wing resting on its side, made up of cleanly layered light blue and grey feathers. A tail composed of four stiff, straight dark brown feathers extends directly backward. Thin white horizontal speed lines trail behind the back wheel and the bird's tail, emphasizing swift forward motion. The bicycle features a classic diamond frame, large wheels with thin black tires, grey rims, and detailed silver spokes, along with a clearly visible front chainring, silver chain, and rear cog. The whimsical scene is set against a clear light blue sky featuring two small, fluffy white clouds on the left and a large, pale yellow sun in the upper right corner that radiates soft, concentric, semi-transparent pastel green and yellow halos. A solid, darker brown shadow is cast directly beneath the bicycle's wheels on the minimalist two-toned brown ground." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/gemini-3-deep-think-complex-pelican.png"></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Jan.  28, 2026, 3:09 p.m.</p><p>Outlets like The Guardian and The New York Times are scrutinizing digital archives as potential backdoors for AI crawlers.</p><div id="content_div-247528">


<p>As part of its mission to preserve the web, the Internet Archive operates crawlers that capture webpage snapshots. Many of these snapshots are accessible through its public-facing tool, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a>. But as AI bots scavenge the web for training data to feed their models, the Internet Archive’s commitment to free information access has turned its digital library into a potential liability for some news publishers.</p>
<p>When The Guardian took a look at who was trying to extract its content, access logs revealed that the Internet Archive was a frequent crawler, said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-hahn-08b45719/">Robert Hahn</a>, head of business affairs and licensing. The publisher decided to limit the Internet Archive’s access to published articles, minimizing the chance that AI companies might scrape its content via the nonprofit’s repository of over one trillion webpage snapshots.</p>

<p>Specifically, Hahn said The Guardian has taken steps to exclude itself from the Internet Archive’s APIs and filter out its article pages from the Wayback Machine’s URLs interface. The Guardian’s regional homepages, topic pages, and other landing pages will continue to appear in the Wayback Machine.</p>
<p>In particular, Hahn expressed concern about the <a href="https://archive.org/help/wayback_api.php">Internet Archive’s APIs</a>. </p>
<p>“A lot of these AI businesses are looking for readily available, structured databases of content,” he said. “The Internet Archive’s API would have been an obvious place to plug their own machines into and suck out the IP.” (He admits the Wayback Machine itself is “less risky,” since the data is not as well-structured.)</p>
<p>As news publishers try to safeguard their contents from AI companies, the Internet Archive is also getting caught in the crosshairs. The Financial Times, for example, blocks any bot that tries to scrape its paywalled content, including bots from OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and the Internet Archive. The majority of FT stories are paywalled, according to director of global public policy and platform strategy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattrogerson/">Matt Rogerson</a>. As a result, usually only unpaywalled FT stories appear in the Wayback Machine because those are meant to be available to the wider public anyway.</p>
<p>“Common Crawl and Internet Archive are widely considered to be the ‘good guys’ and are used by ‘the bad guys’ like OpenAI,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaellloydnelson/">said Michael Nelson</a>, a computer scientist and professor at Old Dominion University. “In everyone’s aversion to not be controlled by LLMs, I think the good guys are collateral damage.”</p>

<p>The Guardian hasn’t documented specific instances of its webpages being scraped by AI companies via the Wayback Machine. Instead, it’s taking these measures proactively and is working directly with the Internet Archive to implement the changes. Hahn says the organization has been receptive to The Guardian’s concerns.</p>
<p>The outlet stopped short of an all-out block on the Internet Archive’s crawlers, Hahn said, because it supports the nonprofit’s mission to democratize information, though that position remains under review as part of its routine bot management. </p>
<p>“[The decision] was much more about compliance and a backdoor threat to our content,” he said.</p>
<p>When asked about The Guardian’s decision, Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle said that “if publishers limit libraries, like the Internet Archive, then the public will have less access to the historical record.” It’s a prospect, he implied, that could undercut the organization’s work countering “<a href="https://firstdraftnews.org/training/information-disorder/">information disorder</a>.”</p>

<p>The Guardian isn’t alone in reevaluating its relationship to the Internet Archive. The New York Times confirmed to Nieman Lab that it’s actively “hard blocking” the Internet Archive’s crawlers. At the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251223163226/http://nytimes.com/robots.txt" target="_blank">end of 2025</a>, the Times also added one of those crawlers — archive.org_bot — to its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/robots.txt" target="_blank">robots.txt file</a>, disallowing access to its content.</p>
<p>“We believe in the value of The New York Times’s human-led journalism and always want to ensure that our IP is being accessed and used lawfully,” said a Times spokesperson. “We are blocking the Internet Archive’s bot from accessing the Times because the Wayback Machine provides unfettered access to Times content — including by AI companies — without authorization.”</p>
<p>Last August, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/757538/reddit-internet-archive-wayback-machine-block-limit">Reddit announced</a> that it would block the Internet Archive, whose digital libraries include countless archived Reddit forums, comments sections, and profiles. This content is not unlike what Reddit now licenses to <a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/reddit-winning-ai-licensing-deals-openai-google-gemini-answers-rsl.php">Google as AI training data for tens of millions of dollars</a>.</p>
<p>“[The] Internet Archive provides a service to the open web, but we’ve been made aware of instances where AI companies violate platform policies, including ours, and scrape data from the Wayback Machine,” a Reddit spokesperson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/757538/reddit-internet-archive-wayback-machine-block-limit">told The Verge</a> at the time. “Until they’re able to defend their site and comply with platform policies…we’re limiting some of their access to Reddit data to protect redditors.”</p>
<p>Kahle has also alluded to steps the Internet Archive is taking to restrict bulk access to its libraries. In a <a href="https://mastodon.archive.org/@brewsterkahle/115368911896794707">Mastodon post</a> last fall, he wrote that “there are many collections that are available to users but not for bulk downloading. We use internal rate-limiting systems, filtering mechanisms, and network security services such as Cloudflare.”</p>
<p>Currently, however, the Internet Archive does not disallow any specific crawlers through its robots.txt file, including those of major AI companies. As of January 12, the robots.txt file for <a href="http://archive.org/">archive.org</a> read: “​​Welcome to the Archive! Please crawl our files. We appreciate it if you can crawl responsibly. Stay open!” Shortly after we inquired about this language, it was changed. The file now reads, simply, “Welcome to the Internet Archive!”</p>

<p>There is evidence that the Wayback Machine, generally speaking, has been used to train LLMs in the past. An <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/ai-chatbot-learning/">analysis of Google’s C4 dataset</a> by the Washington Post in 2023 showed that the Internet Archive was among millions of websites in the training data used to build Google’s T5 model and Meta’s Llama models. Out of the 15 million domains in the C4 dataset, the domain for the Wayback Machine (<a href="http://web.archive.org/">web.archive.org</a>) was ranked as the 187th most present.</p>
<p>In May 2023, the Internet Archive went <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2023/05/29/let-us-serve-you-but-dont-bring-us-down/">offline</a> temporarily after an AI company caused a server overload, Wayback Machine director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjohngraham/">Mark Graham</a> told Nieman Lab this past fall. The company sent tens of thousands of requests per second from virtual hosts on Amazon Web Services to extract text data from the nonprofit’s public domain archives. The Internet Archive blocked the hosts twice before putting out a public call to “respectfully” scrape its site.</p>
<p>“We got in contact with them. They ended up giving us a donation,” Graham said. “They ended up saying that they were sorry and they stopped doing it.”</p>
<p>“Those wanting to use our materials in bulk should start slowly, and ramp up,” <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2023/05/29/let-us-serve-you-but-dont-bring-us-down/">wrote Kahle in a blog post</a> shortly after the incident. “Also, if you are starting a large project please contact us …we are here to help.”</p>
<p>The Guardian’s moves to limit the Internet Archive’s access made us wonder whether other news publishers were taking similar actions. We looked at publishers’ robots.txt pages as a way to measure potential concern over the Internet Archive’s crawling.</p>
<p>A website’s robots.txt page tells bots which parts of the site they can crawl, acting like a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRlQ965pGCA&amp;t=0">doorman</a>,” telling visitors who is and isn’t allowed in the house and which parts are off limits. Robots.txt pages aren’t legally binding, so the companies running crawling bots aren’t obligated to comply with them, but they indicate where the Internet Archive is unwelcome.</p>
<p>For example, in addition to “hard blocking,” The New York Times and The Athletic include the archive.org_bot in their robots.txt file, though they do not currently disallow other bots operated by the Internet Archive. </p>
<p>To explore this issue, Nieman Lab used journalist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/palewire/">Ben Welsh</a>‘s <a href="https://palewi.re/docs/news-homepages/openai-gptbot-robotstxt.html">database of 1,167 news websites</a> as a starting point. As part of a larger side project to archive news sites’ homepages, Welsh runs crawlers that regularly scrape the robots.txt files of the outlets in his database. In late December, we downloaded a spreadsheet from Welsh’s site that displayed all the bots disallowed in the robots.txt files of those sites. We identified four bots that the AI user agent watchdog service <a href="https://darkvisitors.com/">Dark Visitors</a> has associated with the Internet Archive. (The Internet Archive did not respond to requests to confirm its ownership of these bots.) </p>
<p>This data is not comprehensive, but exploratory. It does not represent global, industry-wide trends — 76% of sites in the Welsh’s publisher list are based in the U.S., for example — but instead begins to shed light on which publishers are less eager to have their content crawled by the Internet Archive.</p>
<p>In total, 241 news sites from nine countries explicitly disallow at least one out of the four Internet Archive crawling bots. </p>
<p>Most of those sites (87%) are owned by USA Today Co., the largest newspaper conglomerate in the United States formerly known as Gannett. (Gannett sites only make up 18% of Welsh’s original publishers list.) Each Gannett-owned outlet in our dataset disallows the same two bots: “archive.org_bot” and “ia_archiver-web.archive.org”. These bots were added to the robots.txt files of Gannett-owned publications in 2025.</p>
<p>Some Gannett sites have also taken stronger measures to guard their contents from Internet Archive crawlers. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260000000000*/desmoinesregister.com">URL searches for the Des Moines Register in the Wayback Machine</a> return a message that says, “Sorry. This URL has been excluded from the Wayback Machine.”</p>
<p>“USA Today Co. has consistently emphasized the importance of safeguarding our content and intellectual property,” a company spokesperson said via email. “Last year, we introduced new protocols to deter unauthorized data collection and scraping, redirecting such activity to a designated <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/bot-detection">page</a> outlining our licensing requirements.”</p>
<p>Gannett declined to comment further on its relationship with the Internet Archive. In an October 2025 <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-gannett-cos-q3-2025-digital-focus-amid-revenue-dip-93CH-4320263">earnings call</a>, CEO Mike Reed spoke to the company’s anti-scraping measures. </p>
<p>“In September alone, we blocked 75 million AI bots across our local and USA Today platforms, the vast majority of which were seeking to scrape our local content,” Reed said on that call. “About 70 million of those came from OpenAI.” (<a href="https://www.usatodayco.com/pr/gannett-i-usa-today-network-and-perplexity-announce-strategic-ai-content-licensing-ageement/#:~:text=Gannett%20I%20USA%20TODAY%20Network,available%20for%20a%20broader%20audience.">Gannett signed a content licensing agreement with Perplexity in July 2025</a>.)</p>
<p>About 93% (226 sites) of publishers in our dataset disallow two out of the four Internet Archive bots we identified. Three news sites in the sample disallow three Internet Archive crawlers: Le Huffington Post, Le Monde, and Le Monde in English, all of which are owned by Group Le Monde.</p>

<p>The news sites in our sample aren’t only targeting the Internet Archive. Out of the 241 sites that disallow at least one of the four Internet Archive bots in our sample, 240 sites disallow Common Crawl — another nonprofit internet preservation project that has been <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-fight-against-ai-comes-to-a-foundational-data-set/">more closely linked to commercial LLM development</a>. Of our sample, 231 sites all disallow bots operated by OpenAI, Google AI, and Common Crawl.</p>
<p>As we’ve <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/10/the-wayback-machines-snapshots-of-news-homepages-plummet-after-a-breakdown-in-archiving-projects/">previously reported</a>, the Internet Archive has taken on the Herculean task of preserving the internet, and many news organizations aren’t equipped to save their own work. In December, Poynter <a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2025/poynter-ire-and-internet-archive-launch-todays-news-for-tomorrow-a-project-to-help-newsrooms-preserve-their-digital-footprint/">announced</a> a joint initiative with the Internet Archive to train local news outlets on how to preserve their content. Archiving initiatives like this, while urgently needed, are  few and far between. Since there is no federal mandate that requires internet content to be preserved, the Internet Archive is the most robust archiving initiative in the United States.</p>
<p>“The Internet Archive tends to be good citizens,” Hahn said. “It’s the law of unintended consequences: You do something for really good purposes, and it gets abused.”</p>

                      ================================

                  © 1987-2005 Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam
                                2025-04-17


INTRODUCTION
============

The Amsterdam Compiler Kit is a complete compiler toolchain consisting of
front end compilers for a number of different languages, code generators,
support libraries, and all the tools necessary to go from source code to
executable on any of the platforms it supports.



SUPPORT
=======

Languages:

ANSI C, Pascal, Modula 2, Basic. K&amp;R is supported via the ANSI C compiler.

Platforms:

cpm           produces i80 CP/M .COM files
em22          produces EM22 bytecode files
linux386      produces ELF executables for PC Linux systems
linux68k      produces ELF executables for m68020 Linux systems
linuxmips     produces ELF executables for little-endian MIPS32r2 Linux systems
linuxppc      produces ELF executables for PowerPC Linux systems
minix68k      produces Minix executables for m68000 Minix systems
msdos386      produces i386 MS-DOS 32-bit DPMI .EXE files
msdos86       produces i86 MS-DOS .COM files
osx386        produces i386 OSX MachO executables
osxppc        produces PowerPC OSX MachO executables
pc86          produces bootable floppy disk images for 8086 PCs
pdpv7         produces PDP/11 V7 Unix binaries
rpi           produces Raspberry Pi GPU binaries



INSTALLATION
============

The version 5.0 build mechanism has been completely rewritten (twice).
Installation ought to be fairly straightforward. It will build on Unixishes
including Linux, OSX, and Windows using MSYS2 and mingw32.

Requirements:

- an ANSI C compiler. This defaults to gcc. You can change this by setting
  the CC make variable.

- flex and yacc.

- GNU make.

- Lua (any version) with the lua-posix library installed.

- Python 3.4 or above.

- about 1GB in the target directory.

Instructions:

- edit the Makefile. There's a small section at the top where you can change
  the configuration. Probably the only one you may want to edit is PREFIX,
  which changes where the ACK installs to, and PLATS, which changes which
  architectures are built. Look in `plat/*` to see what plats there are.

- Run:

    make

  ...from the command line. This will do the build.

  The make system is fully parallelisable by default, but does take a while
  to start up.

- Run:

    sudo make install

  ...from the command line. This will install the ACK in your PREFIX
  directory (by default, /usr/local).

The ACK should now be ready to use.



USAGE
=====

Currently I haven't sorted out all the documentation --- it's supplied in the
distribution, but not all of it gets installed yet --- so here is a quickstart
guide.

The main command to use is 'ack'. This invokes the compiler and the linker.
Some useful options include:

  -m&lt;platform&gt;     build for the specified platform
  -o &lt;file&gt;        specifies the output file
  -c               produce a .o file
  -c.s             produce a .s assembly file
  -O               enable optimisation (optimisation levels go up to 6)
  -ansi            compile ANSI C (when using the C compiler)
  -v               be more verbose (repeatable)
  &lt;file&gt;           build file

ack figures out which language to use from the file extension:

  .c               C (ANSI or K&amp;R)
  .b               the PDP-11 dialect of B
  .bas             Basic
  .mod             Modula-2
  .ocm             Occam 1
  .p               Pascal
  .o               object files
  .s               assembly files
  .e               ACK intermediate code assembly files

For further information, see the man page (which actually does get
installed, but is rather out of date).

There are some (known working) example programs in the 'examples' directory.
A sample command line is:

ack -mlinux386 -O examples/paranoia.c



GOTCHAS
=======

There are some things you should be aware of.

- Look at plat/&lt;PLATFORMNAME&gt;/README for information about the supported
  platforms.
  
- The library support is fairly limited; for C, it's at roughly the ANSI C
  level, and for the other languages it's similar.
  
- When compiling languages other than C, the ACK will usually look at the
  first character of the file. If it's a #, then the file will be run through
  the C preprocessor anyway.

- BSD systems may need to up the number of file descriptors (e.g.
  'ulimit -n 200') before the ACK will compile.
  
- The ACK uses its own .o format. You won't be able to mix the ACK's object
  files and another compiler's.

- The distribution contains *everything*, including the weird, ancient,
  archaic stuff that doesn't work any more and never will, such as the int EM
  interpreter and the assembler-linkers. Only some of it builds. Look for
  build.lua files.



DISCLAIMER
==========

The ACK is mature, well-tested software, but the environment in which it was
developed for and tested under is rather different from that available on
today's machines. There will probably be little in the way of logical bugs,
but there may be many compilation and API bugs.

If you wish to use the ACK, *please* join the mailing list. We are interested
in any reports of success and particularly, failure. If it does fail for you,
we would love to know why, in as much detail as possible. Bug fixes are even
more welcome.

The ACK is licensed under a BSD-like license. Please see the 'Copyright' file
for the full text.

You can find the mailing list on the project's web site:

We put these numbers in a spreadsheet, which showed that only 13.95% of the answers were correct. Furthermore, we used the binomial distribution formula and determined there’s a 6.12% chance that we’d get the same or fewer correct answers if the listeners were randomly guessing — slightly above the 5% significance threshold many statisticians use, meaning the results are consistent with randomness. This goes in line with Pano's conclusion that "listeners can't reliably pick out the original from the looped versions," suggesting that they cannot detect any changes introduced by the loop — whether it's pro-grade copper wire or wet mud from somebody's backyard.</p><p>Pano came up with this idea after they watched a documentary, Amigo, where the U.S. Army was setting up a singular telegraph wire in the Philippines. They thought that it wouldn’t work as “you need two wires to complete the circuit.” However, it turns out that the telegraph system used the earth as a return, even through long distances. This got them thinking that if you could send telegraphy signals across the ground, what would an audio signal using the same medium sound like? They then tried various materials like mud and banana, which, although they’re pretty poor conductors, still seemed to introduce imperceptible changes to the signal, at least for the average person.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ANxrrvfaJCA9sdZVeWmSxM"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" id="f4c09db0-3a8e-4bed-9d4b-d5c73cffac90" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

<p>Pressure is mounting on tech companies to shield users from unlawful government requests that advocates say are making it harder to reliably share information about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) online.</p>
<p>Alleging that ICE officers are being doxed or otherwise endangered, Trump officials have spent the last year targeting an unknown number of users and platforms with demands to censor content. Early lawsuits show that platforms have caved, even though experts say they could refuse these demands without a court order.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.thefire.org/sites/default/files/2026/02/Verified%20Complaint%20-%20Rosado%20v.%20Bondi.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed on Wednesday, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) accused Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of coercing tech companies into removing a wide range of content “to control what the public can see, hear, or say about ICE operations.”</p>
<p>It’s the second lawsuit alleging that Bondi and DHS officials are using regulatory power to pressure private platforms to suppress speech protected by the First Amendment. It follows a complaint <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/iceblock-lawsuit-trump-admin-bragged-about-demanding-app-store-removal/">from the developer of an app called ICEBlock</a>, which Apple removed from the App Store in October. Officials aren’t rushing to resolve that case—last month, they requested more time to respond—so it may remain unclear until March what defense they plan to offer for the takedown demands.</p>
<p>That leaves community members who monitor ICE in a precarious situation, as critical resources could disappear at the department’s request with no warning.</p>
<p>FIRE says people have legitimate reasons to share information about ICE. Some communities focus on helping people avoid dangerous ICE activity, while others aim to hold the government accountable and raise public awareness of how ICE operates. Unless there’s proof of incitement to violence or a true threat, such expression is protected.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>

<p>Despite the high bar for censoring online speech, lawsuits trace an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/instagram-user-fights-dhs-for-the-right-to-post-ice-sightings-anonymously/">escalating pattern</a> of DHS increasingly targeting websites, app stores, and platforms—many that have been willing to remove content the government dislikes.</p>
<p>Officials have ordered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/apple-bends-to-trump-admin-demand-to-remove-ice-tracking-apps-like-iceblock/">ICE-monitoring apps to be removed from app stores</a> and even <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.285233/gov.uscourts.dcd.285233.1.0_1.pdf">threatened to sanction CNN</a> for simply reporting on the existence of one such app. Officials have also demanded that Meta delete at least one Chicago-based Facebook group with 100,000 members and made <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/instagram-ice-critic-wins-fight-to-stay-anonymous-as-dhs-backs-down/">multiple unsuccessful attempts</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/trump-admin-pressured-facebook-into-removing-ice-tracking-group/">unmask anonymous users behind other Facebook groups</a>. Even encrypted apps like Signal don’t feel safe from officials’ seeming overreach. FBI Director Kash Patel recently said he has opened an investigation into Signal chats used by Minnesota residents to track ICE activity, NBC News&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/fbi-investigating-minnesota-signal-minneapolis-group-ice-patel-kash-rcna256041" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>.</p>
<p>As DHS censorship threats increase, platforms have done little to shield users, advocates say. Not only have they sometimes failed to reject unlawful orders that simply provided a “a bare mention of ‘officer safety/doxing'” as justification, but in one case, Google complied with a subpoena that left a critical section blank, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/open-letter-tech-companies-must-resist-unlawful-subpoenas-user-data">reported</a>.</p>
<p>For users, it’s increasingly difficult to trust that platforms won’t betray their own policies when faced with government intimidation, advocates say. Sometimes platforms notify users before complying with government requests, giving users a chance to challenge potentially unconstitutional demands. But in other cases, users learn about the requests only as platforms comply with them—even when those platforms have promised that would never happen.</p>
<h2>Government emails with platforms may be exposed</h2>
<p>Platforms could face backlash from users if lawsuits expose their communications to the government, a possibility in the coming months. Last fall, the EFF sued after DOJ, DHS, ICE, and Customs and Border Patrol failed to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests seeking emails between the government and platforms about takedown demands. Other lawsuits may surface emails in discovery. In the coming weeks, a judge will set a schedule for EFF’s litigation.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“The nature and content of the Defendants’ communications with these technology companies” is “critical for determining whether they crossed the line from governmental cajoling to unconstitutional coercion,” EFF’s <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/EFF-v-DOJ-Complaint-11-20-25.pdf">complaint</a> said.</p>
<p>EFF Senior Staff Attorney Mario Trujillo told Ars that the EFF is confident it can win the fight to expose government demands, but like most FOIA lawsuits, the case is expected to move slowly. That’s unfortunate, he said, because ICE activity is escalating, and delays in addressing these concerns could irreparably harm speech at a pivotal moment.</p>

<p>Like users, platforms are seemingly victims, too, FIRE senior attorney Colin McDonnell told Ars.</p>
<p>They’ve been forced to override their own editorial judgment while navigating implicit threats from the government, he said.</p>
<p>“If Attorney General Bondi demands that they remove speech, the platform is going to feel like they have to comply; they don’t have a choice,” McDonnell said.</p>
<p>But platforms do have a choice and could be doing more to protect users, the EFF has said. Platforms could even serve as a first line of defense, requiring officials to get a court order before complying with any requests.</p>
<p>Platforms may now have good reason to push back against government requests—and to give users the tools to do the same. Trujillo noted that while courts have been slow to address the ICEBlock removal and FOIA lawsuits, the government has quickly withdrawn requests to unmask Facebook users soon after litigation began.</p>
<p>“That’s like an acknowledgement that the Trump administration, when actually challenged in court, wasn’t even willing to defend itself,” Trujillo said.</p>
<p>Platforms could view that as evidence that government pressure only works when platforms fail to put up a bare-minimum fight, Trujillo said.</p>

<h2>Platforms “bend over backward” to appease DHS</h2>
<p>An <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/open-letter-tech-companies-must-resist-unlawful-subpoenas-user-data">open letter</a> from the EFF and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) documented two instances of tech companies complying with government demands without first notifying users.</p>
<p>The letter called out Meta for unmasking at least one user without prior notice, which groups noted “potentially” occured due to a “technical glitch.”</p>
<p>More troubling than buggy notifications, however, is the possibility that platforms may be routinely delaying notice until it’s too late.</p>
<p>After Google “received an ICE subpoena for user data and fulfilled it on the same day that it notified the user,” the company admitted that “sometimes when Google misses its response deadline, it complies with the subpoena and provides notice to a user at the same time to minimize the delay for an overdue production,” the letter said.</p>
<p>“This is a worrying admission that violates [Google’s] clear promise to users, especially because there is no legal consequence to missing the government’s response deadline,” the letter said.</p>
<p>Platforms face no sanctions for refusing to comply with government demands that have not been court-ordered, the letter noted. That’s why the EFF and ACLU have urged companies to use their “immense resources” to shield users who may not be able to drop everything and fight unconstitutional data requests.</p>
<p>In their letter, the groups asked companies to insist on court intervention before complying with a DHS subpoena. They should also resist DHS “gag orders” that ask platforms to hand over data without notifying users.</p>
<p>Instead, they should commit to giving users “as much notice as possible when they are the target of a subpoena,” as well as a copy of the subpoena. Ideally, platforms would also link users to legal aid resources and take up legal fights on behalf of vulnerable users, advocates suggested.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>That’s not what’s happening so far. Trujillo told Ars that it feels like “companies have bent over backward to appease the Trump administration.”</p>
<p>The tide could turn this year if courts side with app makers behind crowdsourcing apps <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/iceblock-lawsuit-trump-admin-bragged-about-demanding-app-store-removal/">like ICEBlock</a> and Eyes Up, who are suing to end the alleged government coercion. FIRE’s McDonnell, who represents the creator of Eyes Up, told Ars that platforms may feel more comfortable exercising their own editorial judgment moving forward if a court declares they were coerced into removing content.</p>
<h2>DHS can’t use doxing to dodge First Amendment</h2>
<p>FIRE’s lawsuit accuses Bondi and Noem of coercing Meta to disable a Facebook group with 100,000 members called “ICE Sightings–Chicagoland.”</p>
<p>The popularity of that group surged during “Operation Midway Blitz,” when hundreds of agents arrested more than 4,500 people over weeks of raids that used tear gas in neighborhoods and caused car crashes and other violence. Arrests included US citizens and immigrants of lawful status, which “gave Chicagoans reason to fear being injured or arrested due to their proximity to ICE raids, no matter their immigration status,” FIRE’s complaint said.</p>

<p>Kassandra Rosado, a lifelong Chicagoan and US citizen of Mexican descent, started the Facebook group and served as admin, moderating content with other volunteers. She prohibited “hate speech or bullying” and “instructed group members not to post anything threatening, hateful, or that promoted violence or illegal conduct.”</p>
<p>Facebook only ever flagged five posts that supposedly violated community guidelines, but in warnings, the company reassured Rosado that “groups aren’t penalized when members or visitors break the rules without admin approval.”</p>
<p>Rosado had no reason to suspect that her group was in danger of removal. When Facebook disabled her group, it told Rosado the group violated community standards “multiple times.” But her complaint noted that, confusingly, “Facebook policies don’t provide for disabling groups if a few members post ostensibly prohibited content; they call for removing groups when the group moderator repeatedly either creates prohibited content or affirmatively ‘approves’ such content.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Facebook’s decision came after a right-wing influencer, Laura Loomer, tagged Noem and Bondi in a social media post alleging that the group was “getting people killed.” Within two days, Bondi bragged that she had gotten the group disabled while claiming that it “was being used to dox and target [ICE] agents in Chicago.”</p>
<p>McDonnell told Ars it seems clear that Bondi selectively uses the term “doxing” when people post images from ICE arrests. He pointed to “ICE’s own social media accounts,” which share favorable opinions of ICE alongside videos and photos of ICE arrests that Bondi doesn’t consider doxing.</p>
<p>“Rosado’s creation of Facebook groups to send and receive information about where and how ICE carries out its duties in public, to share photographs and videos of ICE carrying out its duties in public, and to exchange opinions about and criticism of ICE’s tactics in carrying out its duties, is speech protected by the First Amendment,” FIRE argued.</p>
<p>The same goes for speech managed by Mark Hodges, a US citizen who resides in Indiana. He created an app called Eyes Up to serve as an archive of ICE videos. Apple removed Eyes Up from the App Store around the same time that it removed ICEBlock.</p>
<p>“It is just videos of what government employees did in public carrying out their duties,” McDonnell said. “It’s nothing even close to threatening or doxing or any of these other theories that the government has used to justify suppressing speech.”</p>
<p>Bondi bragged that she had gotten ICEBlock banned, and FIRE’s complaint confirmed that Hodges’ company received the same notification that ICEBlock’s developer got after Bondi’s victory lap. The notice said that Apple received “information” from “law enforcement” claiming that the apps had violated Apple guidelines against “defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Apple did not reach the same conclusion when it independently reviewed Eyes Up prior to government meddling, FIRE’s complaint said. Notably, the app remains available in Google Play, and Rosado now manages a new Facebook group with similar content but somewhat tighter restrictions on who can join. Neither activity has required urgent intervention from either tech giants or the government.</p>
<p>McDonnell told Ars that it’s harmful for DHS to water down the meaning of doxing when pushing platforms to remove content critical of ICE.</p>
<p>“When most of us hear the word ‘doxing,’ we think of something that’s threatening, posting private information along with home addresses or places of work,” McDonnell said. “And it seems like the government is expanding that definition to encompass just sharing, even if there’s no threats, nothing violent. Just sharing information about what our government is doing.”</p>
<p>Expanding the definition and then using that term to justify suppressing speech is concerning, he said, especially since the First Amendment includes no exception for “doxing,” even if DHS ever were to provide evidence of it.</p>
<p>To suppress speech, officials must show that groups are inciting violence or making true threats. FIRE has alleged that the government has not met “the extraordinary justifications required for a prior restraint” on speech and is instead using vague doxing threats to discriminate against speech based on viewpoint. They’re seeking a permanent injunction barring officials from coercing tech companies into censoring ICE posts.</p>
<p>If plaintiffs win, the censorship threats could subside, and tech companies may feel safe reinstating apps and Facebook groups, advocates told Ars. That could potentially revive archives documenting thousands of ICE incidents and reconnect webs of ICE watchers who lost access to valued feeds.</p>
<p>Until courts possibly end threats of censorship, the most cautious community members are moving local ICE-watch efforts to group chats and listservs that are harder for the government to disrupt, Trujillo told Ars.</p>

    <h2>Vim 9.2 is available</h2>
    <p><img src="https://www.vim.org/images/vim92_logo.svg" width="500">
    </p>
    <p>The Vim project is happy to announce that Vim 9.2 has been released.</p>
    <p>Vim 9.2 brings significant enhancements to the Vim9 scripting language, improved diff mode, comprehensive completion features, and platform-specific improvements including experimental Wayland support.</p>

    <h2>New Features in Vim 9.2</h2>
    <ul>
	<li><strong>Comprehensive Completion:</strong> Added support for <strong>fuzzy matching</strong> during insert-mode completion and the ability to complete words directly from <strong>registers</strong> (<code>CTRL-X CTRL-R</code>). New <code>'completeopt'</code> flags like <code>nosort</code> and <code>nearest</code> offer finer control over how matches are displayed and ordered.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Modern Platform Support:</strong> Full support for the <strong>Wayland</strong> UI and clipboard has been added. On Linux and Unix-like systems, Vim now adheres to the <strong>XDG Base Directory Specification</strong>, using <code>$HOME/.config/vim</code> for user configuration.</li>
	
	<li><strong>UI Enhancements:</strong> A new <strong>vertical tabpanel</strong> provides an alternative to the horizontal tabline. The <strong>MS-Windows</strong> GUI now supports native dark mode for the menu and title bars, along with improved fullscreen support and higher-quality toolbar icons.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Interactive Learning:</strong> A new built-in <strong>interactive tutor plugin</strong> (started via <code>:Tutor</code>) provides a modernized learning experience beyond the traditional vimtutor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Vim9 Script Evolution</h2>
    <p>Significant language enhancements including native support for <strong>Enums</strong>, <strong>Generic functions</strong>, and the <strong>Tuple</strong> data type. Built-in functions are now integrated as <strong>object methods</strong>, and classes now support protected <code>_new()</code> methods and <code>:defcompile</code> for full method compilation.</p>

    <div>
	<h2>Vim9 Script Ecosystem &amp; AI Integration</h2>
	<p>The maturity of Vim9 script's modern constructs is now being leveraged by advanced AI development tools. Contributor Yegappan Lakshmanan recently demonstrated the efficacy of these new features through two projects generated using GitHub Copilot:</p>

	<ul>
	    <li><strong>Battleship in Vim9:</strong> A complete implementation of the classic game, showcasing classes and type aliases. [<a href="https://github.com/yegappan/battleship.git">GitHub</a>]</li>
	    <li><strong>Number Puzzle:</strong> A logic game demonstrating the efficiency of modern Vim9 for interactive plugins. [<a href="https://github.com/yegappan/number-puzzle">GitHub</a>]</li>
	</ul>
    </div>	

    <h2>Diff Improvements</h2>
    <p>Vim 9.2 introduces significant enhancements to how changes are visualized and aligned in diff mode:</p>

    <ul>
	<li><strong>Linematch Algorithm:</strong> Includes the "linematch" algorithm for the <code>'diffopt'</code> setting. This aligns changes between buffers on similar lines, greatly improving diff highlighting accuracy.</li>
	<li><strong>Diff Anchors:</strong> The new <code>'diffanchors'</code> option allows you to specify anchor points (comma-separated addresses) to split and independently diff buffer sections, ensuring better alignment in complex files.</li>
	<li><strong>Inline Highlighting:</strong> Improves highlighting for changes within a line. This is configurable via the <code>"inline"</code> sub-option for <code>'diffopt'</code>. Note that <code>"inline:simple"</code> has been added to the default <code>'diffopt'</code> value.</li>
    </ul><p>
    Here are some examples for the improved inline highlighting:

	<div>
	    <p>inline:simple (old behavior)</p>

	</p></div>
    </div>

<h2>Changed Default Values</h2>
<p>Several long-standing defaults have been updated to better suit modern hardware and workflows. These values have been removed from <code>defaults.vim</code> as they are now the internal defaults.</p>

    <h2>Completion Feature Examples</h2>
    <p>These examples demonstrate how to use the powerful new completion and introspection tools available in Vim 9.2.</p>

    <div>
    <h3>1. Auto-completion</h3>
    <p>Vim's standard completion frequently checks for user input while searching for new matches. It is responsive irrespective of file size. This makes it well-suited for smooth auto-completion.</p>
    <pre><code>vim9script
def InsComplete()
    if getcharstr(1) == '' &amp;&amp; getline('.')-&gt;strpart(0, col('.') - 1) =~ '\k$'
        SkipTextChangedIEvent()
        feedkeys("\&lt;c-n&gt;", "n")
    endif
enddef

def SkipTextChangedIEvent(): string
    # Suppress next event caused by &lt;c-e&gt; (or &lt;c-n&gt; when no matches found)
    set eventignore+=TextChangedI
    timer_start(1, (_) =&gt; {
        set eventignore-=TextChangedI
    })
    return ''
enddef

set cot=menuone,popup,noselect inf

autocmd TextChangedI * InsComplete()

inoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;c-e&gt; &lt;c-r&gt;=&lt;SID&gt;SkipTextChangedIEvent()&lt;cr&gt;&lt;c-e&gt;

    <h2>Charity: Transition to Kuwasha</h2>
    <p>For over 30 years, Vim has been "Charityware," supporting children in Kibaale, Uganda. Following the passing of Bram Moolenaar, the ICCF Holland foundation was dissolved, and its mission has been carried forward by a new partner.</p>

    <ul>
	<li><strong>ICCF Holland Dissolution:</strong> Because the charity could not be sustained in its original form without Bram, ICCF Holland was dissolved and its remaining funds were transferred to ensure continued support for the Kibaale project.</li>
	<li><strong>Partnership with Kuwasha:</strong> To ensure that aid remained uninterrupted, all sponsorship activities were moved to <a href="https://www.kuwasha.net/ways-to-give/">Kuwasha</a>, a long-term partner based in Canada that now manages the projects in Uganda.</li>
	<li><strong>Continuing the Legacy:</strong> Vim remains Charityware. We encourage users to continue supporting the needy children in Uganda through this new transition.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For information on how to support this cause, please visit the <a href="https://www.vim.org/sponsor/index.php">Sponsor page</a>.</p>
    <h2>Appreciation</h2>
    <p>We would like to thank everybody who contributed to the project through patches, translations, and bug reports. We are very grateful for any support.</p>

    <p>I recently got a smart sleep mask from Kickstarter. I was not expecting to end up with the ability to read strangers' brainwaves and send them electric impulses in their sleep. But here we are.</p>
<p>The mask was from a small Chinese research company, very cool hardware -- EEG brain monitoring, electrical muscle stimulation around the eyes, vibration, heating, audio. The app was still rough around the edges though and the mask kept disconnecting, so I asked Claude to try reverse-engineer the Bluetooth protocol and build me a simple web control panel instead.</p>
<h3 id="bluetooth">Bluetooth</h3><p>The first thing Claude did was scan for BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices nearby. It found mine among 35 devices in range, connected, and mapped the interface -- two data channels. One for sending commands, one for streaming data.</p>
<p>Then it tried talking to it. Sent maybe a hundred different command patterns. Modbus frames, JSON, raw bytes, common headers. Unfortunately, the device said nothing back, the protocol was not a standard one.</p>
<h3 id="the-app">The app</h3><p>So Claude went after the app instead. Grabbed the Android APK, decompiled it with jadx. Turns out the app is built with Flutter, which is a bit of a problem for reverse engineering. Flutter compiles Dart source code into native ARM64 machine code -- you can't just read it back like normal Java Android apps. The actual business logic lives in a 9MB binary blob.</p>
<p>But even compiled binaries have strings in them. Error messages, URLs, debug logs. Claude ran <code>strings</code> on the binary and this was the most productive step of the whole session. Among the thousands of lines of Flutter framework noise, it found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardcoded credentials for the company's message broker (shared by every copy of the app)</li>
<li>Cloud API endpoints</li>
<li>All fifteen command builder function names (e.g. to set vibration, heating, electric stimulation, etc.)</li>
<li>Protocol debug messages that revealed the packet structure -- header, direction byte, command type, payload, footer</li>
</ul>
<p>We had the shape of the protocol. Still didn't have the actual byte values though.</p>
<p>Claude then used <a href="https://github.com/worawit/blutter">blutter</a>, a tool specifically for decompiling Flutter's compiled Dart snapshots. It reconstructs the functions with readable annotations. Claude figured out the encoding, and just read off every command byte from every function. Fifteen commands, fully mapped.</p>
<h3 id="it-works">It works</h3><p>Claude sent a six-byte query packet. The device came back with 153 bytes -- model number, firmware version, serial number, all eight sensor channel configurations (EEG at 250Hz, respiration, 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope). Battery at 83%.</p>
<p>Vibration control worked. Heating worked. EMS worked. Music worked. Claude built me a little web dashboard with sliders for everything. I was pretty happy with it.</p>
<p>That could have been the end of the story.</p>
<h3 id="the-server">The server</h3><p>Remember the hardcoded credentials from earlier? While poking around, Claude tried using them to connect to the company's MQTT broker -- MQTT is a pub/sub messaging system standard in IoT, where devices publish sensor readings and subscribe to commands. It connected fine. Then it started receiving data. Not just from my device -- from <em>all of them</em>. About 25 were active:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sleep masks publishing live EEG brainwave data</li>
<li>Air quality monitors reporting temperature, humidity, CO2</li>
<li>Presence sensors detecting room occupancy</li>
</ul>
<p>Claude captured a couple minutes of EEG from two active sleep masks. One user seemed to be in REM sleep (mixed-frequency activity). The other was in deep slow-wave sleep (strong delta power below 4Hz). Real brainwaves from real people, somewhere in the world.</p>
<p><img src="https://hatzistamou.com/img_assets/eeg_live.png" alt="Live EEG"></p>
<h3 id="ems">EMS</h3><p>The mask also does EMS -- electrical muscle stimulation around the eyes. Controlling it is just another command: mode, frequency, intensity, duration.</p>
<p>Since every device shares the same credentials and the same broker, if you can read someone's brainwaves you can also send them electric impulses.</p>
<h3 id="disclosure">Disclosure</h3><p>For obvious reasons, I am not naming the product/company here, but have reached out to inform them about the issue.</p>
<p>This whole thing made  me revisit Karpathy's <a href="https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/digital-hygiene/">Digital Hygiene</a> post, and you probably should too.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>The reverse engineering -- Bluetooth, APK decompilation, Dart binary analysis, MQTT discovery -- was more or less one-shotted by Claude (Opus 4.6) over a 30' autonomous session.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-373953">
	<div>
			
<p>A convincing lookalike of the popular 7-Zip archiver site has been serving a trojanized installer that silently converts victims’ machines into residential proxy nodes—and it has been hiding in plain sight for some time.</p>



<h2 id="h-i-m-so-sick-to-my-stomach">“I’m so sick to my stomach”</h2>



<p>A PC builder recently turned to Reddit’s r/pcmasterrace community in a panic after realizing they had downloaded 7‑Zip from the wrong website. Following a YouTube tutorial for a new build, they were instructed to download 7‑Zip from 7zip[.]com, unaware that the legitimate project is hosted exclusively at 7-zip.org.</p>



<p>In their Reddit post, the user described installing the file first on a laptop and later transferring it via USB to a newly built desktop. They encountered repeated 32‑bit versus 64‑bit errors and ultimately abandoned the installer in favor of Windows’ built‑in extraction tools. Nearly two weeks later, Microsoft Defender alerted on the system with a generic detection: Trojan:Win32/Malgent!MSR.</p>



<p>The experience illustrates how a seemingly minor domain mix-up can result in long-lived, unauthorized use of a system when attackers successfully masquerade as trusted software distributors.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-trojanized-installer-masquerading-as-legitimate-software">A trojanized installer masquerading as legitimate software</h2>



<p>This is not a simple case of a malicious download hosted on a random site. The operators behind 7zip[.]com distributed a trojanized installer via a lookalike domain, delivering a functional copy of functional 7‑Zip File Manager alongside a concealed malware payload.</p>



<p>The installer is Authenticode‑signed using a now‑revoked certificate issued to Jozeal Network Technology Co., Limited, lending it superficial legitimacy. During installation, a modified build of <code>7zfm.exe</code> is deployed and functions as expected, reducing user suspicion. In parallel, three additional components are silently dropped:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Uphero.exe</strong>—a service manager and update loader</li>



<li><strong>hero.exe</strong>—the primary proxy payload (Go‑compiled)</li>



<li><strong>hero.dll</strong>—a supporting library</li>
</ul>



<p>All components are written to <code>C:\Windows\SysWOW64\hero\</code>, a privileged directory that is unlikely to be manually inspected.</p>



<p>An independent update channel was also observed at <code>update.7zip[.]com/version/win-service/1.0.0.2/Uphero.exe.zip</code>, indicating that the malware payload can be updated independently of the installer itself.</p>



<h2 id="h-abuse-of-trusted-distribution-channels">Abuse of trusted distribution channels</h2>



<p>One of the more concerning aspects of this campaign is its reliance on third‑party trust. The Reddit case highlights YouTube tutorials as an inadvertent malware distribution vector, where creators incorrectly reference 7zip.com instead of the legitimate domain.</p>



<p>This shows how attackers can exploit small errors in otherwise benign content ecosystems to funnel victims toward malicious infrastructure at scale.</p>



<h2 id="h-execution-flow-from-installer-to-persistent-proxy-service">Execution flow: from installer to persistent proxy service</h2>



<p>Behavioral analysis shows a rapid and methodical infection chain:</p>



<p><strong>1. File deployment</strong>—The payload is installed into SysWOW64, requiring elevated privileges and signaling intent for deep system integration.</p>



<p><strong>2. Persistence via Windows services</strong>—Both <code>Uphero.exe</code> and <code>hero.exe</code> are registered as auto‑start Windows services running under System privileges, ensuring execution on every boot.</p>



<p><strong>3. Firewall rule manipulation</strong>—The malware invokes <code>netsh</code> to remove existing rules and create new inbound and outbound allow rules for its binaries. This is intended to reduce interference with network traffic and support seamless payload updates.</p>



<p><strong>4. Host profiling</strong>—Using WMI and native Windows APIs, the malware enumerates system characteristics including hardware identifiers, memory size, CPU count, disk attributes, and network configuration. The malware communicates with iplogger[.]org via a dedicated reporting endpoint, suggesting it collects and reports device or network metadata as part of its proxy infrastructure.</p>



<h2 id="h-functional-goal-residential-proxy-monetization">Functional goal: residential proxy monetization</h2>



<p>While initial indicators suggested backdoor‑style capabilities, further analysis revealed that the malware’s primary function is proxyware. The infected host is enrolled as a residential proxy node, allowing third parties to route traffic through the victim’s IP address.</p>



<p>The <code>hero.exe</code> component retrieves configuration data from rotating “smshero”‑themed command‑and‑control domains, then establishes outbound proxy connections on non‑standard ports such as 1000 and 1002. Traffic analysis shows a lightweight XOR‑encoded protocol (key <code>0x70</code>) used to obscure control messages.</p>



<p>This infrastructure is consistent with known residential proxy services, where access to real consumer IP addresses is sold for fraud, scraping, ad abuse, or anonymity laundering.</p>







<p>The 7‑Zip impersonation appears to be part of a broader operation. Related binaries have been identified under names such as <code>upHola.exe</code>, upTiktok, upWhatsapp, and upWire, all sharing identical tactics, techniques, and procedures:</p>



<ul>
<li>Deployment to SysWOW64</li>



<li>Windows service persistence</li>



<li>Firewall rule manipulation via <code>netsh</code></li>



<li>Encrypted HTTPS C2 traffic</li>
</ul>



<p>Embedded strings referencing VPN and proxy brands suggest a unified backend supporting multiple distribution fronts.</p>



<h2 id="h-rotating-infrastructure-and-encrypted-transport">Rotating infrastructure and encrypted transport</h2>



<p>Memory analysis uncovered a large pool of hardcoded command-and-control domains using <code>hero</code> and <code>smshero</code> naming conventions. Active resolution during sandbox execution showed traffic routed through Cloudflare infrastructure with TLS‑encrypted HTTPS sessions. </p>



<p>The malware also uses DNS-over-HTTPS via Google’s resolver, reducing visibility for traditional DNS monitoring and complicating network-based detection.</p>



<h2 id="h-evasion-and-anti-analysis-features">Evasion and anti‑analysis features</h2>



<p>The malware incorporates multiple layers of sandbox and analysis evasion:</p>



<ul>
<li>Virtual machine detection targeting VMware, VirtualBox, QEMU, and Parallels</li>



<li>Anti‑debugging checks and suspicious debugger DLL loading</li>



<li>Runtime API resolution and PEB inspection</li>



<li>Process enumeration, registry probing, and environment inspection</li>
</ul>



<p>Cryptographic support is extensive, including AES, RC4, Camellia, Chaskey, XOR encoding, and Base64, suggesting encrypted configuration handling and traffic protection.</p>



<h2 id="h-defensive-guidance">Defensive guidance</h2>



<p>Any system that has executed installers from 7zip.com should be considered compromised. While this malware establishes SYSTEM‑level persistence and modifies firewall rules, reputable security software can effectively detect and remove the malicious components. Malwarebytes is capable of fully eradicating known variants of this threat and reversing its persistence mechanisms. In high‑risk or heavily used systems, some users may still choose a full OS reinstall for absolute assurance, but it is not strictly required in all cases.</p>



<p>Users and defenders should:</p>



<ul>
<li>Verify software sources and bookmark official project domains</li>



<li>Treat unexpected code‑signing identities with skepticism</li>



<li>Monitor for unauthorized Windows services and firewall rule changes</li>



<li>Block known C2 domains and proxy endpoints at the network perimeter</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-researcher-attribution-and-community-analysis">Researcher attribution and community analysis</h2>



<p>This investigation would not have been possible without the work of independent security researchers who went deeper than surface-level indicators and identified the true purpose of this malware family.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Luke Acha</strong> provided the first comprehensive analysis showing that the Uphero/hero malware functions as residential proxyware rather than a traditional backdoor. His work documented the proxy protocol, traffic patterns, and monetization model, and connected this campaign to a broader operation he dubbed upStage Proxy. <a href="https://blog.lukeacha.com/2026/01/beware-of-fake-7zip-installer-upstage.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Luke’s full write-up is available on his blog</a>.</li>



<li><strong>s1dhy</strong> expanded on this analysis by reversing and decoding the custom XOR-based communication protocol, validating the proxy behavior through packet captures, and correlating multiple proxy endpoints across victim geolocations. Technical notes and findings were <a href="https://x.com/s1dhy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared publicly on X (Twitter)</a>.</li>

<p>This campaign demonstrates how effective brand impersonation combined with technically competent malware can operate undetected for extended periods. By abusing user trust rather than exploiting software vulnerabilities, attackers bypass many traditional security assumptions—turning everyday utility downloads into long‑lived monetization infrastructure.</p>

<p>
  This post is at least a year old.
  </p>


<p>x86 is back in the general programmer discourse, in part thanks to Apple’s M1 and
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment">Rosetta 2</a>.
As such, I figured I’d do <em>yet another</em> x86-64 post.</p>

<p>Just like <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2020/06/13/How-x86_64-addresses-memory">the last one</a>,
I’m going to cover a facet of the x86-64 ISA that sets it apart
as unusually complex among modern ISAs: the number and diversity of registers available.</p>

<p><a href="https://stefanheule.com/blog/how-many-x86-64-instructions-are-there-anyway/">Like instruction counting</a>,
register counting on x86-64 is subject to debates over methodology. In particular, for this blog
post, I’m going to lay the following ground rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>will</strong> count sub-registers (e.g., <code>EAX</code> for <code>RAX</code>) as distinct registers. My justification:
they have different instruction encodings, and both Intel and AMD optimize/pessimize
particular sub-register use patterns in their microcode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>will</strong> count registers that are present on x86-64 CPUs, but that can’t be used in long mode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>won’t</strong> count registers that are <em>only</em> present on older x86 CPUs, like the 80386 and
80486 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_register">test registers</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>won’t</strong> count microarchitectural implementation details, like shadow registers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>will</strong> count registers that aren’t directly addressable, like MSRs that can only be accessed
through <code>RDMSR</code>. However, I <strong>won’t</strong> (or will try not to) double-count registers that
have multiple access mechanisms (like <code>RDMSR</code> and <code>RDTSC</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>won’t</strong> count model-specific registers that fall into these categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MSRs that are only present on niche x86 vendors (Cyrix, Via)</li>
      <li>MSRs that aren’t widely available on recent-ish x86-64 CPUs
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Errata</strong>: I accidentally included AVX-512 in some of the original counts below,
  not realizing that it hadn’t been released on any AMD CPUs. The post has been updated.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>MSRs that are <em>completely</em> undocumented (both officially and unofficially)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the rules above, I’m going to use the following considerations and methodology
for grouping registers together:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many sources, both official and unofficial, use “model-specific register” as an umbrella term
for any non-core or non-feature-set register supplied by an x86-64 CPU. Whenever possible, I’ll
try to avoid this in favor of more specific categories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both Intel and AMD provide synonyms for registers (e.g. <code>CR8</code> as the “task priority register,” or
<code>TPR</code>). Whenever possible, I’ll try to use the more generic/category conforming name (like <code>CR8</code>
in the case above).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, the individual cores of a multicore processor have independent register states.
Whenever this <strong>isn’t</strong> the case, I’ll make an effort to document it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="general-purpose-registers">General-purpose registers</h2>

<p>The general-purpose registers (or GPRs) are <strong>the</strong> primary registers in the x86-64 register model.
As their name implies, they are the <strong>only</strong> registers that are <em>general purpose</em>: each has a set
of conventional uses<sup id="fnref:conventional"><a href="#fn:conventional" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but programmers are generally free to ignore those conventions and use
them as they please<sup id="fnref:ignore"><a href="#fn:ignore" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Because x86-64 evolved from a 32-bit ISA which in turn evolved from a 16-bit ISA, each
GPR has a set of <em>subregisters</em> that hold the lower 8, 16 and 32 bits of the full 64-bit
register.</p>

<p>As a table:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    
    <th>64-bit</th>
    
    <th>32-bit</th>
    
    <th>16-bit</th>

    <td>RSI</td>
    
    <td>ESI</td>
    
    <td>SI</td>

  <tr>
    
    <td>RSP</td>
    
    <td>ESP</td>
    
    <td>SP</td>
    
    <td>SPL</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>R8</td>
    
    <td>R8D</td>
    
    <td>R8W</td>
    
    <td>R8B</td>

  <tr>
    
    <td>R9</td>
    
    <td>R9D</td>
    
    <td>R9W</td>

  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>R10</td>
    
    <td>R10D</td>
    
    <td>R10W</td>

  <tr>
    
    <td>R11</td>
    
    <td>R11D</td>
    
    <td>R11W</td>
    
    <td>R11B</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>R12</td>
    
    <td>R12D</td>
    
    <td>R12W</td>
    
    <td>R12B</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>R13</td>
    
    <td>R13D</td>
    
    <td>R13W</td>
    
    <td>R13B</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>R14</td>
    
    <td>R14D</td>
    
    <td>R14W</td>
    
    <td>R14B</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>R15</td>
    
    <td>R15D</td>
    
    <td>R15W</td>
    
    <td>R15B</td>
    
  </tr>
  
</tbody></table>

<p>Some of the 16-bit subregisters are also special: the original 8086 allowed the <strong>high</strong> byte
of <code>AX</code>, <code>BX</code>, <code>CX</code>, and <code>DX</code> to be accessed indepenently, so x86-64 preserves this for some
encodings:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    
    <th>16-bit</th>
    
    <th>8-bit (high)</th>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>AX</td>
    
    <td> AH</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>BX</td>
    
    <td> BH</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>CX</td>
    
    <td> CH</td>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>DX</td>
    
    <td> DH</td>
    
  </tr>
  
</tbody></table>

<p>So that’s 16 full-width GPRs, fanning out to another 52 subregisters.</p>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 68</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="special-registers">Special registers</h2>

<p>This is sort of an artificial category: like every ISA, x86-64 has a few “special” registers that
keep things moving along. In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>instruction pointer</em>, or <code>RIP</code>.</p>

    <p>x86-64 has 32- and 16-bit variants of <code>RIP</code> (<code>EIP</code> and <code>IP</code>), but I’m <strong>not</strong> going to count
  them as separate registers: they have identical encodings and can’t be used in the same
  CPU mode<sup id="fnref:ip"><a href="#fn:ip" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>status register</em>, or <code>RFLAGS</code>.</p>

    <p>Just like <code>RIP</code>, <code>RFLAGS</code> has 32- and 16-bit counterparts (<code>EFLAGS</code> and <code>FLAGS</code>). Unlike
  <code>RIP</code>, these counterparts can be partially mixed: <code>PUSHF</code> and <code>PUSHFQ</code> are both valid in
  long mode, and <code>LAHF</code>/<code>SAHF</code> can operate on the bits of <code>FLAGS</code> on some x86-64 CPUs
  outside of compatiblility mode<sup id="fnref:cpuid-lahf-sahf"><a href="#fn:cpuid-lahf-sahf" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. So I’m going to go ahead and count them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 4</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 72</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="segment-registers">Segment registers</h2>

<p>x86-64 has a total of 6 segment registers: <code>CS</code>, <code>SS</code>, <code>DS</code>, <code>ES</code>, <code>FS</code>, and <code>GS</code>. The operation
varies with the CPU’s mode:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In all modes except for long mode, each segment register holds a <em>selector</em>, which indexes into
either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Descriptor_Table">GDT</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Descriptor_Table#Local_Descriptor_Table">LDT</a>. That yields
a segment <em>descriptor</em> which, among other things, supplies the base address and extent of the
segment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In long mode all but <code>FS</code> and <code>GS</code> are treated as having a base address of zero and a 64-bit
extent, effectively producing a flat address space. <code>FS</code> and <code>GS</code> are retained as special cases,
but no longer use the segment descriptor tables: instead, they access base addresses that
are stored in the <code>FSBASE</code> and <code>GSBASE</code> model-specific registers<sup id="fnref:kernelgsbase"><a href="#fn:kernelgsbase" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.
More on those later.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 6</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 78</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="simd-and-fp-registers">SIMD and FP registers</h2>

<p>The x86 family has gone through <em>several</em> generations of SIMD and floating-point instruction
groups, each of which has introduced, extended, or re-contextualized various registers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>x87</li>
  <li>MMX</li>
  <li>SSE (SSE2, SSE3, SSE4, SSE4, …)</li>
  <li>AVX (AVX2, AVX512)</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s do them in rough order.</p>

<h3 id="x87">x87</h3>

<p>Originally a discrete coprocessor with its own instruction set and register file, the x87
instructions have been regularly baked into x86 cores themselves since the 80486.</p>

<p>Because of its coprocessor history, x87 defines both normal registers<sup id="fnref:normal-ish"><a href="#fn:normal-ish" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>
(akin to GPRs) and a variety of special registers needed to control the FPU state:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ST0</code> through <code>ST7</code>: 8 80-bit floating-point registers</li>
  <li><code>FPSW</code>, <code>FPCW</code>, <code>FPTW</code> <sup id="fnref:mynames"><a href="#fn:mynames" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>: Control, status, and tag-word registers</li>
  <li>“Data operand pointer”: I don’t know what this one does, but the Intel SDM specifies it<sup id="fnref:sdm"><a href="#fn:sdm" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></li>
  <li>Instruction pointer: the x87 state machine apparently holds its own copy of the current
x87 instruction</li>
  <li>Last instruction opcode: this is apparently distinct from the x87 opcode, and has its
own register</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 14</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 92</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="mmx">MMX</h3>

<p>MMX was Intel’s first attempt at consumer SIMD in their x86 chips, released back in 1997.</p>

<p>For design reasons that are a complete mystery to me, the MMX registers are actually sub-registers
of the x87 <code>STn</code> registers: each 64-bit <code>MMn</code> occupies the mantissa component of its corresponding
<code>STn</code>. Consequently, x86 (and x86-64) CPUs cannot execute MMX and x87 instructions at the same time.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>: This section incorrectly included <code>MXCSR</code>, which was actually introduced with SSE.

<p>In other words: the lower half of each <code>ZMMn</code> is <code>YMMn</code>, and the lower half of each <code>YMMn</code> is
<code>XMMn</code>. There’s no direct way register access for just the upper half of <code>YMMn</code>, nor does
<code>ZMMn</code> have direct 256- or 128-bit access for the thunks of its upper half.</p>

<p>SSE also defines a new status register, <code>MXCSR</code>, that contains flags roughly parallel
to the arithmetic flags in <code>RFLAGS</code> (along with floating-point flags in the x87 status word).
SSE also introduces a load/store instruction pair for manipulating it (<code>LDMXCSR</code> and <code>STMXCSR</code>).</p>

<p>AVX-512 <strong>also</strong> introduces eight <em>opmask</em> registers, <code>k0</code> through <code>k7</code>. <code>k0</code> is a special case
that behaves much like the “zero” register on some RISC ISAs: it can’t be stored to, and
loads from it always produce a bitmask of all ones.</p>

<p><strong>Errata</strong>: The table above includes AVX-512, which isn’t available on any AMD CPUs as of 2020.
I’ve updated the counts below to only include SSE and AVX2-introduced registers.</p>

<h2 id="bounds-registers">Bounds registers</h2>

<p>Intel added these with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MPX">MPX</a>, which was intended to
offer hardware-accelerated bounds checking. Nobody uses it, since
<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Intel-MPX-Is-Dead">it doesn’t work very well</a>.
But x86 is eternal and slow to fix mistakes, so we’ll probably have these registers taking up space
for at least a while longer:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>BND0</code> — <code>BND3</code>: Individual 128-bit registers, each containing a pair of addresses
for a bound.</li>
  <li><code>BNDCFG</code>: Bound configuration, kernel mode.</li>
  <li><code>BNDCFU</code>: Bound configuration, user mode.</li>

<p>These are what they sound like: registers that aid and accelerate software debuggers, like
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">GDB</a>.</p>

<p>There are 6 debug registers of two types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>DR0</code> through <code>DR3</code> contain linear addresses, each of which is associated with a breakpoint
condition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>DR6</code> and <code>DR7</code> are the debug status and control registers. <code>DR6</code>’s lower bits indicate which
debug conditions were encountered (upon entering the debug exception handler), while <code>DR7</code> controls
which breakpoint addresses are enabled and their breakpoint conditions (e.g., when a particular
address is written to).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What about <code>DR4</code> and <code>DR5</code>? For reasons that are unclear to me, they don’t (and have never)
existed<sup id="fnref:guess"><a href="#fn:guess" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. They <em>do</em> have encodings but are treated as <code>DR6</code> and <code>DR7</code>, respective, or produce
an <code>#UD</code> exception when <code>CR4.DE[bit 3] = 1</code>.</p>

<p>All reserved control registers result in an <code>#UD</code> when accessed, which makes me inclined to not
count them in this post.</p>

<p>In addition to the “main” <code>CRn</code> control registers there are also the “extended” control registers,
introduced with the <code>XSAVE</code> feature set. As of writing, <code>XCR0</code> is the only specified extended
control register.</p>

<p>The extended control registers use <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xgetbv"><code>XGETBV</code></a> and
<a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xsetbv"><code>XSETBV</code></a> instead of a <code>MOV</code> variant.</p>

<h2 id="system-table-pointer-registers">“System table pointer registers”</h2>

<p>That’s what the Intel SDM calls these<sup id="fnref:sdm:1"><a href="#fn:sdm" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>: these registers hold sizes and pointers to various
protected mode tables.</p>

<p>As best I can tell, there are four of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>GDTR</code>: Holds the size and base address of the GDT</li>
  <li><code>LDTR</code>: Holds the size and base address of the LDT</li>
  <li><code>IDTR</code>: Holds the size and base address of the IDT</li>
  <li><code>TR</code>: Holds the TSS selector and base address for the TSS</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>GDTR</code>, <code>LDTR</code>, and <code>IDTR</code> each seem to be 80 bits in 64-bit modes: 16 lower bits for
the size of the register’s table, and then the upper 64 bits for the table’s starting address.</p>

<p><code>TR</code> is likewise 80 bits: 16 bits for the selector (which behaves identically to a segment
selector), and then another 64 for the base address of the TSS<sup id="fnref:unsure"><a href="#fn:unsure" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="memory-type-ranger-registers">Memory-type-ranger registers</h2>

<p>These are an interesting case: unlike all of the other registers I’ve covered so far,

across all cores<sup id="fnref:sdm2"><a href="#fn:sdm2" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="model-specific-registers">Model specific registers</h2>

<p>Model-specific registers are where things get fun.</p>

<p>Like extended control registers, they’re accessed indirectly (by identifier) through a pair
of instructions: <code>RDMSR</code> and <code>WRMSR</code>. MSRs themselves are 64-bits but originated during the
32-bit era, so <code>RDMSR</code> and <code>WRMSR</code> read from and write to <em>two</em> 32-bit registers: <code>EDX</code> and <code>EAX</code>.</p>

<p>By way of example: here’s the setup and <code>RDMSR</code> invocation for accessing the <code>IA32_MTRRCAP</code> MSR,
which includes (among other things) that actual number of MTRRs available on the system:</p>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>MOV</span> <span>ECX</span><span>,</span> <span>0xFE</span> <span>; 0xFE = IA32_MTRRCAP</span>
<span>RDMSR</span>
<span>; The bits of IA32_MTRRCAP are now in EDX:EAX</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

<p><code>RDMSR</code> and <code>WRMSR</code> are privileged instructions, so normal ring-3 code can’t access MSRs
directly<sup id="fnref:msr-driver"><a href="#fn:msr-driver" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. The one (?) exception that I know of is the timestamp counter (<code>TSC</code>),
which is stored in the <code>IA32_TSC</code> MSR but can be read from non-privileged contexts with
<code>RDTSC</code> and <code>RDTSCP</code>.</p>

<p>Two other interesting (but still privileged<sup id="fnref:fsgsbase"><a href="#fn:fsgsbase" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>) cases are <code>FSBASE</code> and <code>GSBASE</code>, which are
stored as <code>IA32_FS_BASE</code> and <code>IA32_GS_BASE</code>, respectively. As mentioned in the segment register
section, these store the <code>FS</code> and <code>GS</code> segment bases on x86-64 CPUs. This makes them targets of
relatively frequent use (by MSR standards), so they have their own dedicated R/W opcodes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>RDFSBASE</code> and <code>RDGSBASE</code> for reading</li>
  <li><code>WRFSBASE</code> and <code>WRGSBASE</code> for writing</li>
</ul>

<p>But back to the meat of things: how many MSRs <em>are</em> there?</p>

<p>Using the standards laid out at the beginning of this post, we’re interested in counting what
Intel calls “architectural” MSRs. From the SDM<sup id="fnref:sdm3"><a href="#fn:sdm3" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many MSRs have carried over from one generation of IA-32 processors to the next and to Intel
64 processors. A subset of MSRs and associated bit fields, which do not change on future
processor generations, are now considered architectural MSRs. For historical reasons (beginning
with the Pentium 4 processor), these “architectural MSRs” were given the prefix “IA32_”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the subsequent table<sup id="fnref:sdm4"><a href="#fn:sdm4" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>, the highest architectural MSR is <code>6097</code>/<code>17D1H</code>, or
<code>IA32_HW_FEEDBACK_CONFIG</code>. So, the naïve answer is over 6000.</p>

<p>However, there are significant gaps in the documented MSR ranges: Intel’s documentation jumps
directly from <code>3506</code>/<code>DB2H</code> (<code>IA32_THREAD_STALL</code>) to <code>6096</code>/<code>17D0H</code> (<code>IA32_HW_FEEDBACK_PTR</code>). On
top of the empty ranges, there are also ranges that are explicitly marked as reserved, either
generally or explicitly for later expansion of a particular MSR family.</p>

<p>To count the <em>actual</em> number of MSRs, I did a bit of pipeline ugliness:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Extract just table 2-2 from Volume 4 of the SDM
(<a href="https://software.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents-tps/335592-sdm-vol-4.pdf">link</a>):</p>

    <div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>  <span>$ </span>pdfjam 335592-sdm-vol-4.pdf 19-67 <span>-o</span> 2-2.pdf
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use <code>pdftotext</code> to convert it to plain text and manually trim the next table from the last page:</p>

    <div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>  <span>$ </span>pdftotext 2-2.pdf table.txt
  <span># edit table.txt by hand</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Split the plain text table into a sequence of words, filter by <code>IA32_</code>, remove cruft, and do a
standard sort-unique-count:</p>

    <div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre>  <span>$ </span><span>tr</span> <span>-s</span> <span>'[:space:]'</span> <span>'\n'</span> &lt; table.txt <span>\</span>
      | <span>grep</span> <span>'IA32_'</span> <span>\</span>
      | <span>tr</span> <span>-d</span> <span>'.'</span> <span>\</span>
      | <span>sed</span> <span>'s/\[.*$//'</span> <span>\</span>
      | <span>sort</span> | <span>uniq</span> | <span>wc</span> <span>-l</span>
  404
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

    <p>(Output preserved for posterity <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/ia32-architectural-msrs.txt">here</a>).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That pipeline left a bit of cruft towards the end thanks to quoted variants, so I count the actual
number at 400 architectural MSRs. That’s a lot more reasonable than 6096!</p>

<h2 id="other-bits-and-wrapup">Other bits and wrapup</h2>

<p>The footnotes at the bottom of this post cover most of my notes, but I also wanted to dump some
other resources that I found useful while discovering registers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://sandpile.org/x86/msr.htm">sandpile.org</a> has a nice visualization of many of the
architectural MSRs, including field breakdowns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vol. 3A § 8.7.1 (“State of the Logical Processors”) of the Intel SDM has a useful list of
nearly all of the registers that are either unique to or shared between x86-64 cores.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/">OSDev Wiki</a> has collection of helpful pages on various x86-64
registers, including a <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/SWAPGS">great page</a> on the behavior of the segment
base MSRs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All told, I think that there are <em>roughly</em> <strong>557</strong> registers on the average (relatively recent)
x86-64 CPU core. With that being said, I have some peripheral cases that I’m not sure about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Modern Intel CPUs use integrated
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Programmable_Interrupt_Controller">APICs</a> as part of
their SMT implementation. These APICs have
<a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/APIC#Local_APIC_registers">their own register banks</a> which can be
memory-mapped for reading and potential modification by an x86 core. I didn’t count them because
(1) they’re memory mapped, and thus behave more like mapped registers from an arbitrary piece of
hardware than CPU registers, and (2) I’m not sure whether AMD uses the same
mechanism/implementation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Intel SDM implies that <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/680996/">Last Branch Records</a> are stored
in discrete, non-MSR registers. AMD’s developer manual, on the other hand, specifies a range of
MSRs. As such, I didn’t attempt to count these separately.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both Intel and AMD have their own (and incompatible) virtualization extensions, as well as their
own enclave/hardened execution extensions. My intuition is that each introduces some additional
registers (or maybe just MSRs), but their vendor-specificity made me inclined to not look too
deeply.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Information on these (and any other) registers would be deeply appreciated.</p>
