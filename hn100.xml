<p>The downside of digital ownership has reared its ugly head for enjoyers of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/tag/ubisoft/" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/tag/ubisoft/">Ubisoft</a>'s open-world multiplayer racer The Crew. The publisher has revoked its licence for those who owned it on Ubisoft Connect, almost destroying fan ambitions to revive the game in both an offline and online format.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-crew-removed-from-sale-will-become-unplayable-after-april-1-we-understand-this-may-be-disappointing-for-players-still-enjoying-the-game/" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-crew-removed-from-sale-will-become-unplayable-after-april-1-we-understand-this-may-be-disappointing-for-players-still-enjoying-the-game/">The Crew was pulled from sale</a> back in December, with Ubisoft revealing that the servers would be shut down at the beginning of April. Frustratingly, despite a large portion of the game being doable in singleplayer, The Crew remained an online-only endeavour throughout its decade-long lifespan. That had already rendered the game unplayable, but it seems Ubisoft is determined to take things one step further to stamp out any attempts to continue playing it past its expiry date.</p><p>Fans began to notice earlier in the week that the licence to the game had been snatched away from them. A message at the top of the game's library page reads, "You no longer have access to this game. Why not check the Store to pursue your adventures?" It's also been moved to its own individual section in player libraries, listed under "inactive games". Apparently booting the game directly from the installation directory will still launch the game, but only in a demo mode.</p><p>The news has, unsurprisingly, gone down very poorly. "This was the saddest and most ruthless decision I've ever seen in gaming history," one Redditor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c1la9j/comment/kz59uec/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c1la9j/comment/kz59uec/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">commented</a> after a screenshot began circulating on the site. "I will always fight for digital media, I love all the advantages it gives to users all around the world. But this… we need protection on the national or European level, that when we purchase something, we need to have lifetime access to it. No matter what."</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-320-80.jpg" alt="Ubisoft Connect's store which shows that the licence for The Crew has been revoked." srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi.jpg"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ubisoft)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A further Reddit user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c1la9j/comment/kz4rn3d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c1la9j/comment/kz4rn3d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">called it</a> "really abhorrent behavior that needs to stop being legal," with another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c1la9j/comment/kz4q9er/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c1la9j/comment/kz4q9er/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">writing</a>, "In an ideal world, revoking a license like this should entitle the buyer to a refund. I'm not sure why they're even bothering doing this. The game isn't playable anymore, so what exactly is the harm in keeping the game available for download for those who have purchased it? Server space? Is Ubisoft really that cheap?"</p><p>It's worth noting that it appears you can technically still download the game on Steam, but any attempt to play is followed-up with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://imgur.com/WPOWIPc" target="_blank" data-url="https://imgur.com/WPOWIPc">a request to input a game key</a></p><p>Now it's one thing to just delist a game and still allow owners to download and boot it up if they want—even if the game is technically dead—but it's another thing to revoke the licence to the files entirely.

I asked project member ChemicalFlood how it had impacted their plans:</p><p><em>"We are deeply saddened by Ubisoft's choice to start revoking licences to this game when people have paid hard-earned cash for it," he told me. "In regard to the project, yes! We are currently working on a Server Emulator as opposed to cracking the game. Before the shutdown of the servers, we took the precaution of capturing Network Communications Data. Had we not done this, the project would [have] sadly fallen over and this game would [have] been lost forever.</em></p><p><em>"Thankfully, a server emulation is still possible. But no other patch is possible due to the high amount of DRM placed into the game by Ubisoft, which sadly has restricted our ability to work on a fix, but not impossible!"</em></p><p>I also asked ChemicalFlood how the news had gone down with fans and The Crew Unlimited Discord:&nbsp;</p><p><em>"Obviously, Ubisoft pulling the game licences has left a sour taste in every gamer's mouth and it has unfortunately made it so the game cannot even be launched without it turning into a restricted trial mode. However, we can bypass this new change made by them without having to modify the existing game files, so the project is still on track!</em></p><p><em>"It should go without saying that, by any means, the fact that the community has to implement something like this to continue playing something we all paid for is abysmal, especially something of this magnitude. We of course love the game and want it to be played for generations to come (my own son loved playing this on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/tag/playstation/" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/tag/playstation/">PlayStation</a>, 'loved' being the keyword!) But Ubisoft should [have] implemented an offline mode and they could [have]! The offline mode already exists in the files, we just can't turn it on because of the DRM in place.</em></p><p><em>"We hope that the </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/"><em>Stopkillinggames</em></a><em> campaign will mean that the communities and fans of these games will not be expected to be able to restore every single online-only game like this."</em></p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgYXE9WrSfSCZwKiVbFWui-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgYXE9WrSfSCZwKiVbFWui-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgYXE9WrSfSCZwKiVbFWui-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgYXE9WrSfSCZwKiVbFWui-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgYXE9WrSfSCZwKiVbFWui-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgYXE9WrSfSCZwKiVbFWui-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgYXE9WrSfSCZwKiVbFWui-320-80.jpg" alt="Ubisoft Connect's store which shows that the licence for The Crew has been revoked." srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgYXE9WrSfSCZwKiVbFWui-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgYXE9WrSfSCZwKiVbFWui-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgYXE9WrSfSCZwKiVbFWui-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgYXE9WrSfSCZwKiVbFWui-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgYXE9WrSfSCZwKiVbFWui-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgYXE9WrSfSCZwKiVbFWui-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgYXE9WrSfSCZwKiVbFWui.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgYXE9WrSfSCZwKiVbFWui.jpg"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ubisoft)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've requested comment from Ubisoft regarding the situation and will update if I hear back. I'll be interested to know if the publisher provides any solid reason for being extra thorough with its shutdown process. There's a good chance it has something to do with licensing—there are a good deal of licensed songs in The Crew, not to mention all of the real-world car manufacturers present, too. It could make for a sticky situation keeping the files around, and perhaps it was easier to try and kill the whole thing instead.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of the reason, it's an ever-looming reminder of how fragile digital ownership can be. A study by the Video Game History Foundation last year found that around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/study-finds-over-87-percent-of-games-are-unplayable-without-resorting-to-piracy-scavenger-hunts-or-travelling-to-an-archive/" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/study-finds-over-87-percent-of-games-are-unplayable-without-resorting-to-piracy-scavenger-hunts-or-travelling-to-an-archive/">87% of games are unplayable</a> without diving into some kind of piracy or fan-created archive, and that number could even worsen as physical discs slowly die out. But preservation is becoming a bigger topic, one that's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/events-conferences/preserving-old-games-was-seen-as-a-non-commercial-art-project-until-recently-says-nightdive-director-they-were-great-then-and-theyre-great-now-and-companies-have-begun-to-realize-that/" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/events-conferences/preserving-old-games-was-seen-as-a-non-commercial-art-project-until-recently-says-nightdive-director-they-were-great-then-and-theyre-great-now-and-companies-have-begun-to-realize-that/">now being taken more seriously</a> as a means of conserving the medium.</p><p>Earlier this month, YouTuber Ross Scott <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/stop-killing-games-campaign/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/stop-killing-games-campaign/">launched a campaign</a> called "Stop Killing Games" with The Crew as its primary example. His hope is to eventually win a legal victory that would require publishers to keep their live service games playable in some form after they end support, such as by releasing private servers.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Police in Japan have arrested a 36-year-old man on suspicion of selling illegally modified Pokémon save data to customers online — a practice which is banned under the country’s <a href="https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/view/3629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 Unfair Competition Prevention Act</a>.</p><p>As reported by the <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/lnews/kochi/20240410/8010020207.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese website NHK News</a>, and translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hacked-pokemon-seller-arrested-by-japanese-police/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, the suspect was apprehended by police on April 9 after a ‘police cyber patrol’ discovered evidence that the individual had used special tools to illegally modify save data for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-violet">Pokémon Violet</a> in order to change Pokémon move sets.A 36-year-old man was arrest for selling illegally modified Pokemon save data.</p><p>The 36-year-old allegedly took custom orders for rare Pokémon, and sold the resulting tampered data between December 2022 to March 2023, for up to 13,000 yen ($84) a time on a website that served as a marketplace for video game assets and items. He also offered deals in which six Pokémon would be created for the equivalent of roughly $30 in yen.</p><p>The 36-year-old has reportedly admitted to committing the crimes at the heart of the ongoing investigation, while providing the justification that he did it to earn a living. According to Automaton, the suspect could face up to five years imprisonment, and/or a fine of up to 5 million yen (over $32,600).</p><p>This isn’t the first time that criminals have sought to make money off of Game Freak’s wildly popular franchise. For example, In 2021 an ill-fated Pokemon card heist saw one desperate man <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/man-arrested-after-literal-pokemon-card-heist?_gl=1*17zenfa*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTg2MzE0MTUzOC4xNzEyODUwNTk0*_ga_736S6FVMCL*MTcxMjg1MDU5My4xLjAuMTcxMjg1MDU5My4wLjAuMA..">attempt to descend from a six-story building in order to steal a treasure trove of trading cards</a> and cash from a Tokyo store. </p><p>2022 saw the trend continue, with criminals in Tokyo committing a series of high-value Pokemon burglaries, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-and-other-trading-cards-targets-of-unprecedent-number-of-robberies-in-japan">including one instance in which theives made off with a haul of cards worth over $60,000</a>. Its worth noting that the raw last for Pokemon — and the trouble it can land you in — is felt well beyond the criminal fraternity. As a case in point January 2022 saw two Los Angeles police officers fired <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lapd-officers-fired-for-chasing-snorlax-in-pokemon-go-instead-of-robbers">after they ignored a call to attend a burglary in order to chase down a Snorlax</a> in <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokemon Go</a>.</p><p>While you’re here why not take a moment to check out IGN’s ranking of the top 10 best pokemon video games of all time, or discover <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-face-off-ign-readers-have-chosen-which-pocket-monster-is-the-very-best">which Pokemon our readers have crowned as the very best of all time in our 2021 face off</a>.</p><p><em>Anthony is a freelance contributor covering science and video gaming news for IGN.

While I do not expect everyone to take even a passing interest in the rabbit-hole of the situation or the context, I figured it was worth writing a few quick addendums.</p><p>Naturally, as is the case when you post anything anywhere in public, I am called a liar. I’ll simply say that everything I describe in the blog entry happened. I contacted a VCF administrator and was told it was all disposed of, and that they kept the bins. I am fine with people claiming that disposal was not what happened, but this is what I was told, directly, in human words. The fact that I am seeing contradictory and confusing descriptions of what happened is not a checkmark destined for the Win column.</p></div>



<p>A few people have rushed to indicate that I need to be more careful describing “which” VCF entity is at fault. I am sad to report to them all that the Byzantine VCF structure of name licensing, geographic branding, and internal corporate entity is meaningless to anyone six inches away. You all know each other and you all interchangeably use nomenclature. If you are part of an organization that calls itself some form of “VCF” and need an opportunity to write a statement about how your organization in a solitary/separate entity and should be considered more worthy or ethical than others, feel absolutely free.</p>



<p>A small sliver of people were concerned I was saying that I was never going to go to any computer history conference or event again. I am a free person with the freedom to attend whatever is open to the public. As it stood, however, VCF East was the easiest event for me to attend, so it was where I saw people the most. A minor point is that I considered attendance a form of endorsement, but that is my own personal choice. The chances of me attending other events is, like death by cow, low but never zero.</p>



<p>The rest of the discussions I have seen from the blog entry, raging in the usual stages of social media and posting forums, have failed to require any further response or thought from me personally.</p>



<p>Finally, this is all relatively minor in terms of the work I do and projects I focus on, an event that brought me some fury but which has mostly played the part of filed under “life lessons”. I just got tired of having quiet inward emotion when I was reminded of the event, specifically when VCF announcements would pass by my screen, followed by nice folks asking if they would be seeing me at the event. Now I have made a statement, and rather than the beginning of a saga, I consider it the end of one. My conversations with people and organizations I shift materials to are much longer, much more involved, and with much more contingencies as a result of this event, and things are better for it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Good news for those hoping to cling on to working from home: After a year of cracking down with rigid return-to-office mandates—and instilling fear in those who upheaved their life during the pandemic—defeated CEOs are now finally accepting that hybrid working is here to stay.&nbsp;</p><div>



<p><a href="https://fortune.com/company/kpmg/" target="_blank" rel="">KPMG</a> surveyed U.S. CEOs of companies turning over at least $500 million and found that <a href="https://kpmg.com/kpmg-us/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2024/KPMG-2024-US-CEO-Outlook-Pulse-Survey.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just one-third expect a full return to the office</a> in the next three years.</p>



<p>So it’s official: Leaders who believe that office workers will be back at their desks five days a week in the near future are now in the small minority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a complete 360 on their stance last year, when 62% of CEOs surveyed predicted that <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/05/ceo-rto-kpmg-research-return-to-work-full-time-5-days/" target="_self" rel="">working from home would end by 2026.</a></p>



<p>At the time, 90% of CEOs even admitted that they were so steadfast on summoning staff back to their vertical towers that they were sweetening the pot with salary raises, promotions, and favorable assignments to those who showed face more.</p>



<p>But now, bosses are backtracking: Nearly half of CEOs have concluded that the future of work is hybrid—up from 34% last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, a sizable chunk of CEOs aren’t just embracing working from home on Fridays, they’re going one step further and ditching the workday altogether.</p>



<p>KPMG found that a third of CEOs are exploring the feasibility of a four-day week at their firm.</p>



<h2>Why the change of heart?</h2>



<p>Many CEOs have dedicated the last year to shaking off pandemic-era habits of working from home and calling staff back to the office, but their mandates have been met with resistance.</p>



<p>Deutsche Bank’s decision to outright <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/22/four-day-weekends-from-home-over-fridays-increasingly-just-another-office-day-data/" target="_self" rel="">ban staff from working at home on a Friday</a> and the following Monday has not been taken lightly by staff—a large number of its 90,000-strong workforce have reportedly <a href="https://fortune.com/europe/2024/02/27/deutsche-bank-remote-work-return-to-office-enormous-resistance/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" rel="">started posting critical remarks</a> on the company’s internal messaging board to make their distaste for the new set-up known.</p>



<p><a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_blank" rel="">Amazon</a> is perhaps the most documented example of how ugly the RTO battle can get: Around 30,000 employees <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-hr-boss-rejects-employee-remote-work-petition-2023-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed a petition</a> protesting the company’s in-office mandate, and more than 1,800 <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/31/amazon-headquarters-workers-walkout-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" rel="">pledged to walk out</a> from their jobs to take a stand.</p>



<p><a href="https://fortune.com/europe/2023/08/01/research-damaging-results-mandated-return-to-office-worse-than-we-thought-rto-remote-work-careers-leadership-gleb-tsipursky/" target="_self" rel="">Research has echoed</a> that nearly half of companies with return-to-office mandates witnessed a higher level of employee attrition than they had anticipated, and 29% of companies enforcing office returns are struggling with recruitment.</p>



<p>It perhaps explains why, as KPMG’s data shows, CEOs are now waking up to the fact that the future of work is probably the happy medium of hybrid.</p>



<p>“CEOs have realized that forcing people back into the office can only go on for so long,” Amrit Sandhar, CEO of &amp;Evolve an employee engagement consultancy tells <em>Fortune.</em> </p>



<p>“With Gen Z over the next few years making up, in some cases the majority of the workforce, how long can CEOs insist people come into the office, when people are choosing to work remotely?</p>



<p>“We are at the threshold of a new dawn and trying to hold on to past mindsets will have a direct impact on the caliber of people you attract going forward.”</p>



<p>Lewis Maleh, CEO of the global executive recruitment agency Bentley Lewis, has already witnessed a U-turn to more flexible job ads.</p>



<p>“I’ve noticed a definite rise in job postings advertising remote or hybrid work,”&nbsp; Maleh tells <em>Fortune</em>. </p>



<p>“We haven’t worked on any searches that require the candidate to be in the office five days per week in the past six months globally.”</p>



<p>“The shift demonstrates the cementing of hybrid work models, as CEOs increasingly recognize flexibility as a key factor in attracting and retaining top talent.”</p></div><p>Subscribe to CHRO Daily, our newsletter focusing on helping HR executive navigate the changing needs of the workplace. <a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/chro-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=chro_daily" target="_self" rel="">Sign up</a> for free.</p></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://securelist.com/xz-backdoor-story-part-1/112354/">https://securelist.com/xz-backdoor-story-part-1/112354/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40017310">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
													<p>On March 29, 2024, a single <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">message</a> on the Openwall OSS-security mailing list marked an important discovery for the information security, open source and Linux communities: the discovery of a malicious backdoor in <strong>XZ</strong>. <strong>XZ </strong>is a compression utility integrated into many popular distributions of Linux.</p>
<p>The particular danger of the backdoored library lies in its use by the OpenSSH server process <strong>sshd</strong>. On several systemd-based distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian and RedHat/Fedora Linux, OpenSSH is patched to use systemd features, and as a result has a dependency on this library (note that Arch Linux and Gentoo are unaffected). The ultimate goal of the attackers was most likely to introduce a remote code execution capability to <strong>sshd</strong> that no one else could use.</p>
<p>Unlike other supply chain attacks we have seen in Node.js, <a href="https://securelist.com/two-more-malicious-python-packages-in-the-pypi/107218/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PyPI</a>, <a href="https://social.librem.one/@eighthave/112194828562355097" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FDroid</a>, and the Linux <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210421130105.1226686-1-gregkh@linuxfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kernel</a> that mostly consisted of atomic malicious patches, fake packages and typosquatted package names, this incident was a multi-stage operation that almost succeeded in compromising SSH servers on a global scale.</p>
<p>The backdoor in the liblzma library was introduced at two levels. The source code of the build infrastructure that generated the final packages was slightly modified (by introducing an additional file <strong>build-to-host.m4</strong>) to extract the next stage script that was hidden in a test case file (<strong>bad-3-corrupt_lzma2.xz</strong>). These scripts in turn extracted a malicious binary component from another test case file (<strong>good-large_compressed.lzma</strong>) that was linked with the legitimate library during the compilation process to be shipped to Linux repositories. Major vendors in turn shipped the malicious component in beta and experimental builds. The compromise of XZ Utils is assigned <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3094" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2024–3094</a> with the maximum severity score of 10.</p>

<h2 id="initial-infection-analysis">Initial infection analysis</h2>
<p>The XZ git repository contains a set of test files that are used when testing the compressor/decompressor code to verify that it’s working properly. The account named Jia Tan or “<a href="https://github.com/JiaT75" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jiaT75</a>“, <a href="https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/cf44e4b7f5dfdbf8c78aef377c10f71e274f63c0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">committed</a> two test files that initially appeared harmless, but served as the bootstrap to implant backdoor.</p>
<p>The associated files were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>bad-3-corrupt_lzma2.xz</strong> (<a href="https://opentip.kaspersky.com/86fc2c94f8fa3938e3261d0b9eb4836be289f8ae/?utm_source=SL&amp;utm_medium=SL&amp;utm_campaign=SL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">86fc2c94f8fa3938e3261d0b9eb4836be289f8ae</a>)</li>
<li><strong>good-large_compressed.lzma</strong> (<a href="https://opentip.kaspersky.com/540c665dfcd4e5cfba5b72b4787fec4f/?utm_source=SL&amp;utm_medium=SL&amp;utm_campaign=SL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50941ad9fd99db6fca5debc3c89b3e899a9527d7</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These files were intended to contain shell scripts and the backdoor binary object itself. However, they were hidden within the malformed data, and the attacker knew how to properly extract them when needed.</p>
<h3>Stage 1 – The modified <strong>build-to-host</strong> script</h3>
<p>When the XZ release is ready, the official Github repository distributes the project’s source files. Initially, these releases on the repository, aside from containing the malicious test files, were harmless because they don’t get the chance to execute. However, the attacker appears to have only added the malicious code that bootstrap the infection when the releases were sourced from <strong>https://xz[.]tukaani.org</strong>, which was under the control of Jia Tan.</p>
<p>This URL is used by most distributions, and, when downloaded, it comes with a file named <strong>build-to-host.m4</strong> that contains malicious code.</p>
<p><strong>build-to-host.m4 </strong>(<a href="https://opentip.kaspersky.com/b4dd2661a7c69e85f19216a6dbbb1664/?utm_source=SL&amp;utm_medium=SL&amp;utm_campaign=SL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">c86c8f8a69c07fbec8dd650c6604bf0c9876261f</a>) is executed during the build process and executes a line of code that fixes and decompresses the first file added to the tests folder:</p>

<p>This line of code replaces the “broken” data from <strong>bad-3-corrupt_lzma2.xz</strong> using the <strong>tr</strong> command, and pipes the output to the <strong>xz -d</strong> command, which decompresses the data. The decompressed data contains a shell script that will be executed later using <strong>/bin/bash</strong>, triggered by this <strong>.m4</strong> file.</p>

<p>To execute the next stage, it uses <strong>good-large_compressed.lzma</strong>, which is indeed compressed correctly with XZ, but contains junk data inside the decompressed data.</p>
<p>The junk data removal procedure is as follows: the <strong>eval</strong> function executes the head pipeline, with each <strong>head</strong> command either ignoring the next 1024 bytes or extracting the next 2048 or 724 bytes.</p>
<p>In total, these commands extracted <strong>33,492 </strong>bytes (<strong>2048*16 + 724 </strong>bytes). The <strong>tail</strong> command then retains the final <strong>31,265 </strong>bytes of the file and ignores the rest.</p>
<p>Then, the <strong>tr</strong> command applies a basic substitution to the output to deobfuscate it. The second XZ command decompresses the transformed bytes as a raw <strong>lzma </strong>stream, after which the result is piped into shell.</p>

<p>The last stage shell script performs many checks to ensure that it is running in the expected environment, such as whether the project is configured to use <a href="https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/GNU_IFUNC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IFUNC</a> (which will be discussed in the next sections).</p>

<p>Many of the other checks performed by this stage include determining whether GCC is used for compilation or if the project contains specific files that will be used by the script later on.</p>
<p>In this stage, it extracts the backdoor binary code itself, an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Object-File-Format.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">object file</a> that is currently hidden in the same <strong>good-large_compressed.lzma</strong> file, but at a different offset.</p>
<p>The following code handles this:</p>

<p>The extraction process operates through a sequence of commands, with the result of each command serving as the input for the next one. The formatted one-liner code is shown below:</p>

<p>Initially, the file <strong>good-large_compressed.lzma</strong> is extracted using the <strong>XZ</strong> tool itself. The subsequent steps involve calling a chain of <strong>head</strong> calls with the “<strong>eval $i”</strong> function (same as the stage 3 extraction).</p>
<p>Then a custom RC4-like algorithm is used to decrypt the binary data, which contains another compressed file. This compressed file is also extracted using the XZ utility. The script then removes some bytes from the beginning of the decompressed data using predefined values and saves the result to disk as <strong>liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o</strong>, which is the backdoor file used in the linking process.</p>
<p>Finally, the script modifies the function <strong>is_arch_extension_supported</strong> from the <strong>crc_x86_clmul.h</strong> file in <strong>liblzma</strong>, to replace the call to the <strong>__get_cpuid</strong> function with <strong>_get_cpuid</strong>, removing one underscore character.</p>
<p>This modification allows it to be linked into the library (we’ll discuss this in more detail in the next section). The whole build infection chain can be summarized in the following scheme:</p>

<h2 id="binary-backdoor-analysis">Binary backdoor analysis</h2>
<h3 id="a-stealth-loading-scenario">A stealth loading scenario</h3>
<p>In the original XZ code, there are two special functions used to calculate the CRC of the given data: <strong>lzma_crc32 </strong>and <strong>lzma_crc64</strong>. Both of these functions are stored in the ELF symbol table with type <a href="https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/GNU_IFUNC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IFUNC</a>, a feature provided by the GNU C Library (GLIBC). IFUNC allows developers to dynamically select the correct function to use. This selection takes place when the dynamic linker loads the shared library.</p>
<p>The reason XZ uses this is that it allows for determining whether an optimized version of the <strong>lzma_crcX </strong>function should be used or not. The optimized version requires special features from modern processors (CLMUL, SSSE3, SSE4.1). These special features need to be verified by issuing the <strong>cpuid </strong>instruction, which is called using the <a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/6f9ba3ea55477cf1bd3d37e40ad116150c06a75e/gcc/config/i386/cpuid.h#L324" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>__get_cpuid</strong></a> wrapper/intrinsic provided by GLIBC, and it’s at this point the backdoor takes advantage to load itself.</p>
<p>The backdoor is stored as an object file, and its primary goal is to be linked to the main executable during compilation. The object file contains the <strong>_get_cpuid</strong> symbol, as the injected shell scripts remove one underscore symbol from the original source code, which means that when the code calls <strong>_get_cpuid</strong>, it actually calls the backdoor’s version of it.</p>

<h3 id="backdoor-code-analysis">Backdoor code analysis</h3>
<p>The initial backdoor code is invoked twice, as both <strong>lzma_crc32</strong> and <strong>lzma_crc64</strong> use the same modified function (<strong>_get_cpuid</strong>). To ensure control over this, a simple counter is created to verify that the code has already been executed. The actual malicious activity starts when the <strong>lzma_crc64</strong> IFUNC invokes <strong>_get_cpuid</strong>, sees the counter value 1 indicating that that the function has already been accessed, and initiates one final step to redirect to the true entry point of this malware.</p>

<p>To initialize the malicious code, the backdoor first initializes a couple of structures that hold core information about the current running process. Primarily, it locates the Global Offset Table (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Offset_Table">GOT</a>) address using hardcoded offsets, and uses this information to find the <strong>cpuid</strong> pointer inside it.</p>

<p>The GOT contains the offsets of symbols, including the <strong>cpuid</strong> wrapper. The backdoor then swaps the pointers to the main malware function, and calls it as if it were calling <strong>cpuid</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="core-behavior">Core behavior</h3>
<p>The main goal of the backdoor is to successfully hook specific functions that will allow it to monitor every connection to the infected machine. The targeted functions include:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Targeted function</strong></td>
<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>RSA_public_decrypt</strong></td>
<td>Used by <strong>libcrypto</strong> to decrypt a ciphertext signed by a private key</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>EVP_PKEY_set1_RSA</strong></td>
<td>Used by <strong>libcrypto</strong> to set the RSA key of a given context</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>RSA_get0_key</strong></td>
<td>Used by <strong>libcrypto</strong> to retrieve an RSA key</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>However, hooking all these functions is not a simple and straightforward task for the backdoor. It involves accessing many internal structures and manipulating process-specific structures until it achieves its goal, and it also needs to be as stealthy as possible, which means that the malicious code contains multiple checks to avoid being analyzed.</p>
<h3 id="execution-environment-check">Execution environment check</h3>
<p>It first parses <strong>ld-linux</strong> (dynamic linker), which is primarily responsible for dynamically resolving symbol addresses in memory. It also extracts various information about the environment and verifies that the current process the backdoor is running in matches its execution criteria, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current process is <strong>/usr/bin/sshd</strong></li>
<li>Check if the kill switch is present</li>
</ul>
<p>It extracts the name of the current process from <strong>argv[0]</strong> and also parses all the process environment variables to see if any of them are present in its internal string table. If a match is found, or the process is not <strong>sshd</strong>, the malware halts its execution.</p>

<p>The only variable inside its own table is <strong>yolAbejyiejuvnup=Evjtgvsh5okmkAvj</strong>, which in this context serves as a <strong>kill switch</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-trie-structure">The trie structure</h3>
<p>One of the distinctive features of the backdoor is the use of a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trie</a> structure for string operations. Instead of directly comparing strings or using string hashes to match a particular constant (for example, the name of a library function), the code performs a trie lookup, and checks if the result is equal to a certain constant number. For example, the magic value for the ELF header results in the trie returning <strong>0x300</strong>, and the name of the <strong>system</strong> function is matched with a return value of <strong>0x9F8</strong>. Trie is not just used for comparisons: certain functions that use pointers to strings (for example, <strong>ssh-2.0</strong>) search for these strings in the host binary using the trie, so there will be no suspicious data in the backdoor’s body.</p>
<p>The implementation of the trie uses 16-byte bitmasks, each half corresponding to the byte input ranges <strong>0x00-0x3F</strong> and <strong>0x40-0x7F</strong>, and 2-byte trie leaf nodes, 3 bits of which are flags (direction, termination) and the rest is reserved for the value (or the location of the next node).</p>

<h3 id="symbol-resolver">Symbol resolver</h3>
<p>There are at least three symbol resolver-related routines used by the backdoor to locate the ELF Symbol structure, which holds information such as the symbol name and its offset. All symbol resolver functions receive a key to be searched in the trie.</p>
<div id="attachment_112368"><p><a href="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150247/XZ_backdoor_analysis_05.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-112368" src="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150247/XZ_backdoor_analysis_05-1024x195.png" alt="Symbol resolver example" width="1024" height="195" srcset="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150247/XZ_backdoor_analysis_05-1024x195.png 1024w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150247/XZ_backdoor_analysis_05-300x57.png 300w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150247/XZ_backdoor_analysis_05-768x146.png 768w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150247/XZ_backdoor_analysis_05-740x141.png 740w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150247/XZ_backdoor_analysis_05-800x153.png 800w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150247/XZ_backdoor_analysis_05.png 1028w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-112368">Symbol resolver example</p></div>
<p>One of the backdoor resolver functions iterates through all symbols and verifies which one has the desired key. If it is found, it returns the <strong>Elf64_Sym</strong> structure, which will later be used to populate an internal structure of the backdoor that holds all the necessary function pointers. This process is similar to that commonly seen in Windows threats with API hashing routines.</p>
<p>The backdoor searches many functions from the libcrypto (OpenSSL) library, as these will be used in later encryption routines. It also keeps track of how many functions it was able to find and resolve; this determines whether it is executing properly or should stop.</p>
<p>Another interesting symbol resolver abuses the <strong>lzma_alloc</strong> function, which is part of the liblzma library itself. This function serves as a helper for developers to allocate memory efficiently using the default allocator (malloc) or a custom one. In the case of the XZ backdoor, this function is abused to make use of a fake allocator. In reality, it functions as another symbol resolver. The parameter intended for “allocation size” is, in fact, the symbol key inside the trie. This trick is meant to complicate backdoor analysis.</p>

<p>The backdoor dynamically resolves its symbols while executing; it doesn’t necessarily do so all at once or only when it needs to use them. The resolved symbols/functions range from legitimate OpenSSL functions to functions such as <strong>system</strong>, which is used to execute commands on the machine.</p>
<h3 id="the-symbind-hook">The Symbind hook</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the primary objective of the backdoor initialization is to successfully hook functions. To do so, the backdoor makes use of <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/rtld-audit.7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>rtdl-audit</strong></a>, a feature of the dynamic linker that enables the creation of custom shared libraries to be notified when certain events occur within the linker, such as symbol resolution. In a typical scenario, a developer would create a shared library following the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/rtld-audit.7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>rtdl-audit</strong> manual</a>. However, the XZ backdoor opts to perform a runtime patch on the already registered (default) interfaces loaded in memory, thereby hijacking the symbol-resolving routine.</p>

<p>The addresses for <strong>dl_audit</strong> and <strong>dl_naudit</strong>, which holds the number of audit interfaces available, are obtained by disassembling both the <strong>dl_main</strong> and <strong>dl_audit_symbind_alt</strong> functions. The backdoor contains an internal minimalistic <strong>disassembler </strong>used for instruction decoding. It makes extensive use of it, especially when hunting for specific values like the <strong>*audit</strong> addresses.</p>

<p>The <strong>dl_naudit</strong> address is found by one of the <strong>mov </strong>instructions within the <strong>dl_main</strong> function code that accesses it. With that information, the backdoor hunts for access to a memory address and saves it.</p>
<p>It also verifies if the memory address acquired is the same address as the one accessed by the <strong>dl_audit_symbind_alt</strong> function on a given offset. This allows it to safely assume that it has indeed found the correct address. After it finds the <strong>dl_naudit </strong>address, it can easily calculate where <strong>dl_audit </strong>is, since the two are stored next to each other in memory.</p>

<p>In this article, we covered the entire process of backdooring <strong>liblzma (XZ)</strong>, and delved into a detailed analysis of the binary backdoor code, up to achieving its principal goal: hooking.</p>
<p>It’s evident that this backdoor is highly complex and employs sophisticated methods to evade detection. These include the multi-stage implantation in the <strong>XZ</strong> repository, as well as the complex code contained within the binary itself.</p>
<p>There is still much more to explore about the backdoor’s internals, which is why we have decided to present this as <strong>Part I</strong> of the <strong>XZ</strong> backdoor series.</p>
<p>Kaspersky products detect malicious objects related to the attack as <strong>HEUR:Trojan.Script.XZ</strong> and <strong>Trojan.Shell.XZ</strong>. In addition, Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Linux detects malicious code in SSHD process memory as <strong>MEM:Trojan.Linux.XZ</strong> (as part of the Critical Areas Scan task).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>A controversial US <a href="https://www.wired.com/live/section-702-reauthorization-congress-2024/?id=6615b9e20bc16967abadab74">wiretap program</a> days from expiration cleared a major hurdle on its way to being reauthorized.</p><p>After months of delays, false starts, and interventions by lawmakers working to preserve and expand the US intelligence community’s spy powers, the House of Representatives voted on Friday to extend Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for two years.</p><p>Legislation extending the program—controversial for being abused by the government—passed in the House in a <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024119">273–147 vote</a>. The Senate has yet to pass its own bill.</p><p>Section 702 permits the US government to wiretap communications between Americans and foreigners overseas. Hundreds of millions of calls, texts, and emails are intercepted by government spies each with the “compelled assistance” of US communications providers.</p><p>The government may strictly target foreigners believed to possess “foreign intelligence information,” but it also eavesdrops on the conversations of an untold number of Americans each year. (The government claims it is impossible to determine how many Americans get swept up by the program.) The government argues that Americans are not themselves being targeted and thus the wiretaps are legal. Nevertheless, their calls, texts, and emails may be stored by the government for years, and can later be accessed by law enforcement without a judge’s permission.</p><p>The House bill also dramatically expands the statutory definition for communication service providers, something FISA experts, <a data-offer-url="https://www.zwillgen.com/law-enforcement/fisa-702-reauthorization-amendments-second-time-not-charm/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.zwillgen.com/law-enforcement/fisa-702-reauthorization-amendments-second-time-not-charm/&quot;}" href="https://www.zwillgen.com/law-enforcement/fisa-702-reauthorization-amendments-second-time-not-charm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">including Marc Zwillinger</a>—one of the few people to advise the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC)—have publicly warned against.</p><p>“Anti-reformers not only are refusing common-sense reforms to FISA, they’re pushing for a major expansion of warrantless spying on Americans,” US senator Ron Wyden tells WIRED. “Their amendment would force your cable guy to be a government spy and assist in monitoring Americans’ communications without a warrant.”</p><p>The FBI’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/05/19/fbi-digital-surveillance-misuse-jan6-blm/">track record of abusing the program</a> kicked off a rare détente last fall between progressive Democrats and pro-Trump Republicans—both bothered equally by the FBI’s targeting of activists, journalists, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/darin-lahood-fbi-backdoor-search/">a sitting member of Congress</a>. But in a major victory for the Biden administration, House members voted down an amendment earlier in the day that would’ve imposed new warrant requirements on federal agencies accessing Americans’ 702 data.</p><p>“Many members who tanked this vote have long histories of voting for this specific privacy protection,” says Sean Vitka, policy director at the civil-liberties-focused nonprofit Demand Progress, “including former speaker Pelosi, Representative Lieu, and Representative Neguse.”</p><p>The warrant amendment was passed earlier this year by the House Judiciary Committee, whose long-held jurisdiction over FISA has been challenged by friends of the intelligence community. Analysis by the Brennan Center this week found that 80 percent of the base text of the FISA reauthorization bill had been authored by intelligence committee members.</p><p>“Three million Americans' data was searched in this database of information,” says Representative Jim Jordan, chair of the House Judiciary Committee. “The FBI wasn't even following its own rules when they conducted those searches. That's why we need a warrant.”</p><p>Representative Mike Turner, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, campaigned alongside top spy agency officials for months to defeat the warrant amendment, arguing they’d cost the bureau precious time and impede national security investigations. The communications are legally collected and already in the government's possession, Turner argued; no further approval should be required to inspect them.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“The United States is at its greatest risk of terrorism in more than a decade following the horrific October 7th attack on Israel, and the [intelligence community] must focus attention and resources on that threat while continuing to stay ahead of China,” Turner and Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a joint statement after the vote, adding that 702 remains one of the country's most effective national security tools.</p><p>“It allows the United States to counter our adversaries, like China and Russia, thwart potential terrorist attacks from ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Hamas, and Hezbollah, and disrupt international drug cartels who are looking to smuggle fentanyl into our nation,” they said.</p><p>The FBI introduced a slate of new internal policies to clamp down on the abuse itself, changes that the Biden administration argues are sufficient to ward off future abuse. Knowingly searching the database for information about Americans requires analysts—who must now submit to annual training sessions—to seek approval from higher up the chain of command than before. Running batch queries targeting Americans’ communications now requires a consultation with a government attorney.</p><p>While opposing the search warrants, Turner backed a ban on searches of 702 data for criminal cases that lack any foreign element. While that amendment has been welcomed by members on both sides of the issue, privacy hawks say the ban is not quite the major reform that Turner has proclaimed. Data on the program made public by the FISC suggests the ban will in reality affect less than a handful of cases each year.</p><p>Critics of the program say that relying on the FBI to internally police against its own constitutional violations is a tactic that has failed in the past, and that the bureau can no longer be trusted not to spy on Americans without cause.</p><p>“Section 702 has been abused under presidents from both political parties, and it has been used to unlawfully surveil the communications of Americans across the political spectrum,” says Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. “The Senate must add a warrant requirement and rein in this out-of-control government spying.”</p><p>Judiciary members had also sought to include an amendment banning the government from buying Americans' geolocation data from private companies. At Turner’s behest, House speaker Mike Johnson killed the amendment earlier in the week.</p><p>The US Supreme Court has recognized geolocation data as protected from seizure by the “probable cause” standard. Rather than begin applying for warrants, the government has circumvented the ruling in many cases, buying up GPS data from companies that consumers largely believe are tracking them purely for advertising purposes.</p><p>“They’re buying data. That’s what they’re doing,” says Warren Davidson, a Republican congressperson from Ohio. “They’re structuring markets to collect the data and they’re circumventing the Fourth Amendment. We need to turn that off.”</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

Many things happened along the road, and about a week ago we released our first (small) game on Steam.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2816120/Mazelit/" rel="nofollow">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2816120/Mazelit/</a></p><p>The demo is free to play up to level 8 (the final game plays up to level 80) and we'd appreciate any feedback you have, whether it's for the store page or the game itself.</p><p>We made the game in Godot 4.2 in roughly 3 months and I was working full time next to it. Since we ran into a bunch of roadblocks, we decided to also offer the entire source code up as a DLC in case someone wants to go look how we implemented the game, mod the game, or compile it for a different platform. The only thing we can't redistribute with the game code is the Steamworks SDK, which is available for download from Steam.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="content:encoded"><p>The smell of mold hit James “Lucky” Dugan the moment he walked into the plant.</p>
<p>Last fall, Dugan was one of thousands of union construction workers to arrive in small-town Glendale, Kentucky, to build a vast factory for Ford and SK On, a South Korean company. The plant, when completed, will make batteries for nearly a million electric pickup trucks each year. </p>
<p>When Dugan walked in, huge wooden boxes containing battery-making machines, largely shipped from overseas, were laid across the mile-long factory floor. Black streaks on those wooden boxes, plus the smell, immediately raised alarm bells for workers. But for months, those concerns were met with little remedy from the contractors hired by BlueOval to oversee construction. </p>
<p>Dugan and scores of others now believe they are in the midst of a health crisis at the site. “We don’t get sick pay,” Dugan said. “You’re sick, you’re out of luck.”</p>
<p>The BlueOval SK Battery Park, billed to open in 2025, is a banner project for President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, a program of public subsidies and financing to companies moving away from fossil fuels. The Department of Energy has pledged to support the construction of three BlueOval plants in Tennessee and Kentucky with a $9.2 billion low-cost loan. </p>
<p>But under all the high-tech green fanfare, several construction workers, including some who wished to be anonymous, say the site has been gripped by mold and respiratory illness—medieval hazards that workers feel managers neglected in the pressure to quickly open the plant. </p>

<p>Jason Shaffer, a fellow member with Dugan of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was tasked with setting electrical wiring right above laborers breaking down wooden crates. He believes that mold exposure led to the illness that knocked him out of work for over a week. </p>
<p>“Three nights ago, I couldn’t get air in my lungs," Shaffer said in early February. “I was seeing fireflies, coughing up chunks like white leather all night, crawling across the floor.” A nearby clinic diagnosed Shaffer with a bacterial infection of the lungs, but he has yet to get a diagnosis and care for his mold exposure. </p>
<p>Amid contractor companies’ rush to build the plant for Ford, many have required their union workers to build on 12-hour shifts, seven days a week. Despite months of worker concerns, managers waited until early February to take basic precautions against the mold—precautions that might slow construction. </p>
<p>Three months after workers first brought their complaints to management, the Kentucky Education and Labor Cabinet is now investigating the issue. That state agency, along with managers at BlueOval and two contracting companies, did not respond to requests for comment. But the president of an electrical contractor at BlueOval, in an email to a site manager which workers obtained and shared on Facebook, wrote he considers it “inevitable” that contractors will finally shut down the site for a mold cleanup for “most of March.”  </p>
<p>The start of this Kentucky green jobs boom reminds Shaffer of what workers faced in the years before unions: “It’s production supersedes all, even life.”</p>
<h3>HIGH-TECH, OLD FOE</h3>
<p>Since construction began on the Kentucky BlueOval factory in early 2022, workers have raised safety issues. </p>
<p>Electrical workers complained to foremen about the scarce, unheated outdoor portajohns that contractors often left uncleaned and overflowing. The day before a state safety agency inspection last month, Shaffer says, contractors rolled in new portajohns. Another worker sent extensive photos to management of structural concerns in the building, where he had circled joints and supports he considered deeply unsafe. </p>
<p>The building structure was largely in place by spring 2023. Soon after, workers say the sub-contractor Lesco began directing laborers to haul the heavy equipment crates inside and break them down on the factory floor.</p>
<p>Although Shaffer raised concerns about the black streaks and smell from the boxes early in the fall, contractors didn’t shift procedure. In November, with a cold and wet winter rolling in, the general contractor Abel decided to close the huge bay doors on the building, which had previously helped keep the area ventilated.</p>
<h3>MOUNTING ILLNESSES</h3>
<p>That’s when workers say they started to fall sick with respiratory illnesses that kept coming back. At least a few have been diagnosed with Covid or flu. But others who are sick said they have tested negative for those viruses, while struggling to get mold tests. Far from their homes in this sparse stretch of Kentucky, on breaks between marathon shifts, many have struggled to get health care at all. </p>
<p>In December, Dugan drove to a clinic and a distant hospital where he was “told I had the flu, then told I had a pulmonary condition. Finally I had to go to the ER in an ambulance, I couldn’t breathe, and got an X ray, which found something in my lungs.”</p>
<p>Worker complaints piled up until, on December 8, Abel management hired the firm Environmental Testing &amp; Consulting of Kentucky to take “limited samples” for mold. Their report, sent to Abel less than one week later, found seven types of mold inside the wooden crates, including three in “heavy” concentrations. It also noted an “intense mold odor” inside the containers. </p>
<p>To limit exposure, the report included a recommendation for handling the wooden boxes: “DO NOT PUT INSIDE.”</p>
<p>Workers say they first saw the report in early January, and Lesco management continued to bring crates inside and break them down there until early February. In that time, Shaffer said, another 15 workers he knows on site have been ill. “Basically everybody I know on the job says they’ve been sick repeatedly since they started here.” An electrical worker, who wanted to remain anonymous due to concerns about his employment, said he knew 10 co-workers who had taken mold spit tests in recent weeks, with five returning positive. </p>
<h3> ‘SLIGHT ODOR’</h3>
<p>A January 19 notice from Abel addresses the mold concerns but seems to downplay the situation, casting the odor as “slight” and stating that reports by two environmental testing agencies found the mold to be non-hazardous. The company instructed workers with pre-existing conditions or those who are “overly sensitive to molds/dust” to wear a disposable mask. </p>
<p>Paula Schenck, environmental specialist at the University of Connecticut, said that mold exposure, particularly indoors and over a long period of time, could cause health issues. </p>
<p>“Moldy smells and evidence of water damage does correlate with respiratory symptoms in some people, irrespective of what sampling you do,” she said, noting that anyone who thinks they are having mold-induced respiratory issues should see their doctor. “Equally important, the moldy smell is an indication that there are other things—dust mites, critters, bacteria. There’s a whole biological soup that can then be aerosolized that can cause respiratory symptoms.”</p>
<p>Schenck cautioned that workers’ positive mold tests could only prove they’d been exposed, not that mold was causing their illness. But the confirmed presence of mold on-site, she said, indicated the need for serious precautions.</p>
<p>With over a 1,000 electrical workers on the BlueOval site, many spread the word about mounting illnesses on their breaks and over Facebook. Dugan organized a weekly “Brotherhood Night” for IBEW members to gather at a bar or restaurant. Recently, that gathering became a fundraiser to help the family members of “sparkies” laid out by illness, or who needed car repairs to move to a new job. </p>
<p>Although Dugan, Shaffer, and other members say their union stewards on site helped press their concerns to management, they say that local and international IBEW officers who visited the facility scoffed at their concerns. Dugan says a local officer refused to file a grievance on his behalf about the mold in January. One worker requested to stay anonymous out of concern that union officials might withhold his future job placements if he spoke out. Officers with the IBEW local and district did not return requests for comment.</p>
<p>While the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has no specific standard for mold, Debbie Berkowitz, former OSHA chief of staff and fellow at Georgetown University’s Kalmanovitz Initiative, said that OSHA could still cite employers for failing to protect workers’ health. OSHA recommends that workers handling mold-contaminated materials be provided with an N-95 mask, at a minimum.</p>
<p>Kentucky, however, runs its own worker safety program—one that is notorious for taking a more lenient and pro-industry approach to enforcement than OSHA. The state’s labor cabinet is now <a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/business/mold-rampant-at-fords-kentucky-ev-battery-site-workers-say/article_5111bbfe-c14f-11ee-8658-03bf99040de7.html">investigating</a> the situation and visited the construction site in late January after receiving complaints from workers.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.osha.gov/ords/imis/establishment.search?p_logger=1&amp;establishment=&amp;State=KY&amp;officetype=all&amp;Office=all&amp;sitezip=42740&amp;p_case=all&amp;p_violations_exist=all&amp;startmonth=02&amp;startday=06&amp;startyear=2019&amp;endmonth=02&amp;endday=06&amp;endyear=2024">Records show</a> that, in the past 11 months, the Kentucky agency has opened 12 investigations into contractors over health or safety complaints at the BlueOval site. Half of those cases were closed without any penalty or finding of wrongdoing, and at least two were accidents that resulted in the companies changing procedures; the other six investigations are still ongoing.</p>
<p>Penalties for violations in Kentucky are lower than at the federal level, and the state will only accept complaints from the workers themselves, meaning a wealth of non-employee complaints go ignored. In 2018, the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/workers-rights/fatal-flaws-how-kentucky-fails-its-workers/">found</a> that the agency had “failed to properly investigate nearly every single worksite death in two years,” and OSHA’s audit that year found that the state-run agency was investigating fewer workplaces.</p>
<p>On February 1, local TV channel WDRB aired a story about worker mold concerns and illnesses at the BlueOval site. In the days after, Shaffer says, Abel management finally started making changes. “They’re handing out masks, trying to get more people to wear them. They say they’re going to bring in a third party contractor to open the boxes outside.” A notice from Abel dated February 3 says that the company will start providing workers with suits, goggles, dust masks, and gloves, as well as spraying the wooden crates with a bleach solution.</p>
<p>But according to the Environmental Testing &amp; Consulting report, mold issues in BlueOval’s supply chain “are not going to change any time soon.”</p>
<p>“Roughly 1,500 out of 12,000 seaworthy metal containers are on-site as of now. It may not be possible to stop this contamination from happening considering the many years of planning taken to begin the construction of the battery plant,” inspectors wrote.</p>
<p>Along with dozens of other workers they know, Dugan and Shaffer have volunteered for layoffs and plan to move to new jobs. They expect less-seasoned workers will fill their shoes.</p>
<p>A looming shortage of skilled hands has at least one contractor considering dirty tricks. In the internal email where Lighthouse Electric president Anton Mikec said a March BlueOval shutdown looked “inevitable” for mold cleanup, he also asked for a list of BlueOval workers. His goal: make sure to “turn them around at the door” at his company’s Indiana jobsite, so they’d be more likely to stay laid off and hungry to work at BlueOval in April. </p>
<p>To stop that kind of opportunistic blacklisting by construction bosses, IBEW and many building trades have won contract rights to a union hiring hall that handles worker dispatch. In the new manufacturing building boom, it may take union pressure to enforce that hard-won right.</p>
<h3>CANARY IN THE BATTERY PLANT</h3>
<p>Since it passed in August 2022, the Biden administration has trumpeted the Inflation Reduction Act as a crowning achievement, allocating a landmark $369 billion to climate and clean energy programs. At $9.2 billion, the BlueOval loan is not only the largest IRA incentive, but also the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-ford-ev-battery-plant-funding-biden-green-technology/">largest</a> financial backing offered by the federal government to an automaker since the 2009 financial crisis.</p>
<p>The state of Kentucky has also shown unprecedented support for the project in the form of a $250 million upfront forgivable loan. <a href="https://goodjobsfirst.org/kentuckys-ev-battery-deals-carry-big-costs-for-taxpayers/">According to</a> the non-profit government watchdog Good Jobs First, the loan is the “biggest economic development deal in Kentucky history,” as well as “likely the most generous corporate subsidy the state has ever offered.”</p>
<p>These public subsidies have gently encouraged union labor, but not mandated it. Ford has not committed to bring BlueOval manufacturing workers under its master contract with the United Auto Workers, even after the union’s 2023 strike <a href="https://labornotes.org/2023/11/auto-workers-ratify-new-contracts-big-3">won unionization</a> of similar battery plants at GM and Stellantis.</p>
<p>But even with fully union construction at the BlueOval Kentucky site, workers said the grueling shifts and outbreak of illness left them worried about the direction of the building boom.</p>
<p>“We’re all scared because we know we could be carrying mold on our clothes back to our families, exposing the community,” said Dugan. “This is corporate America walking all over us.”</p>

<p>An official report into the <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2022/08/17/norway-timber-tretten-bridge-collapse/">collapse of a 10-year-old</a> mass-timber <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/bridges/">bridge</a> in <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/norway/">Norway</a> in August 2022 has criticised the structure's design and construction.<span id="more-2056395"></span></p>


<p>Two drivers had to be rescued after the Tretten Bridge, over the Gudbrandsdalslågen river in the Øyer area of southern Norway, <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2022/08/17/norway-timber-tretten-bridge-collapse/">gave way as a heavy goods vehicle was crossing</a>.</p>
<p>Completed in only 2012, the <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/glued-laminated-timber/">glulam</a>-and-steel <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/truss-bridges/">truss bridge</a> was designed by Norwegian architecture studio <a href="https://plan.no/">Plan Arkitekter</a> and engineering firm <a href="https://www.norconsult.com/">Norconsult</a> for the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nsia.no/Road/Published-reports/2024-03">A recent report by the Norwegian Safety Investigation Authority (NSIA)</a> was critical of parties involved in the bridge's construction and management.</p>

<p>"A short construction period, span lengths and reuse of existing foundation were framework conditions for the planning of the bridge," it continued.</p>
<p>"These framework conditions, combined with the choice of material and a strong focus on aesthetics, contributed to the structure not being robust."</p>
<p><strong>Failings over 2016 bridge collapse</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nsia.no/Road/Published-reports/2023-03">An earlier report</a> concluded that the bridge most likely collapsed as a result of block shear failure – a type of fracture – in one of its timber diagonal members that had become weak over time.</p>
<p>Tretten Bridge was designed while building regulations in Norway were in transition from a national system to European codes.</p>
<p>Provisions for this transitional period enabled the project to follow the older national standards, which unlike the Eurocodes did not account for block shear failure.</p>
<p>"In retrospect, all the involved parties can be criticised for selecting and accepting regulations that proved to have a serious shortcoming (block shear failure)," the NSIA said.</p>

<p>It found that despite "serious faults" being identified at Tretten Bridge around that time, little action was taken by the Norwegian roads authority.</p>
<p>"This represents a system failure in the NPRA, reflecting a lack of knowledge about block shear failure, as well as shortcomings in the bridge management system and risk management," the report said.</p>
<p>"The NSIA believes that Tretten Bridge should either immediately have been closed or traffic restrictions imposed in 2016 when finding over-utilisation in relation to block shear in several of the bridge's connections," it added.</p>
<p>Six safety recommendations have been issued based on the investigation, which the NSIA said provide lessons for relevant organisations in Norway and abroad.</p>
<p>These include reviewing the process for regulating and approving road-related structures and their materials in Norway and clarification of building regulations.</p>

<p>"As far as the Accident Investigation Board is aware, there are no wooden and steel truss bridges in the world that are comparable to Tretten Bridge," said the NSIA report (translated from Norwegian).</p>
<p>"The bridge was special both in terms of span length and asymmetry, trusses in the same direction and the combination of wood and steel."</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetics "not a governing topic"</strong></p>
<p>The NPRA is currently undertaking steps to improve bridge safety. Four similar bridges to Tretten Bridge <a href="https://www.tu.no/artikler/halvannet-ar-etter-tretten-kollapsen-10-av-14-bruer-stengt-eller-delvis-stengt/544644">will reportedly be rebuilt following inspections carried out after its collapse</a>.</p>
<p>Nine of 14 timber bridges that were closed following the incident remained shut or still had restrictions in place as of last month.</p>
<p>Plan Arkitetker has designed many of Norway's wooden bridges.</p>
<p>"If you read the conclusion from NSIA you will see that the collapse of the Tretten Bridge was caused by deficient regulations (national code) for building timber structures at the time of planning/construction," the studio's Yngve Aartun told Dezeen in a statement.</p>

<p>"The bridge had a normal time schedule for engineering and construction. The aesthetics was decided by structural and constructional considerations and not a governing topic to decide the structure in the planning process."</p>
<p>NPRA director general Ingrid Dahl Hovland said the authority is "well underway" with measures to address bridge safety.</p>
<p>"We are in the process of signing off on the first measures," she said. "We want to ensure that any nuances between the safety recommendations from NSIA and the package of measures are captured. This work has top priority."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <p>If you're not familiar with the Recovery Kit, it's something I made back in 2019 and posted to my original back7.co blog.  I created it before I knew what a "cyberdeck" was beyond a simple part of William Gibson's <a href="https://amzn.to/3VRuXKo?ref=doscher.com" rel="noreferrer">Neuromancer</a>.  I wanted a rugged computer enclosure for my Raspberry Pi, and I'd been unhappy with overly simplistic and cheap cases for the Raspberry Pi at the time.  I had some projects in mind for GPIO, but sadly many of those haven't come to light since I made the Recovery Kit 5 years ago.</p><p>I have been making other stuff since then, but the Recovery Kit got picked up by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/11/27/20983472/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit-apocalypse-cyberdeck-build-jay-doscher?ref=doscher.com" rel="noreferrer">The Verge</a>, the <a href="https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/articles/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit-project-showcase?ref=doscher.com" rel="noreferrer">Raspberry Pi Magazine</a>, Hackster, and more- but the bucket list items were from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21647398&amp;ref=doscher.com" rel="noreferrer">Hackernews</a>, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/11/11/a-mobile-terminal-for-the-end-of-the-world/?ref=doscher.com" rel="noreferrer">Hackaday</a>, and <a href="https://uncrate.com/off-grid-cyberdeck-computer/?ref=doscher.com" rel="noreferrer">Uncrate</a>.  I'm still a daily reader of all three!  In the last 5 years I've lost count of all the variations I've made in CAD to try and make something I felt was an improvement on the well-rounded Recovery Kit.  I am grateful for the springboard that the exposure this project has granted me.  It's allowed me to connect and share with a pretty special audience.  However, my designs over the last few years for an updated RK were left unpublished.  They  just didn't show enough variation on the original idea.  The Quick Kit and its variants have arguably had a bigger impact to people, since it allowed for making a rugged Pi computer with a much simpler assembly process (and without any soldering).  The versions I released late last year only need a single 3D printed part and some hardware off Amazon, so making something simpler wasn't my direction here.</p><h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3><p>This is going to be a pretty lengthy post, but if you just want the parts list, it's at the end of the article. For now though, I'd like to talk about some of the challenges with the original Recovery Kit.</p><p><strong>The battery.</strong>  Folks asking for a battery version almost outnumbers the people on Reddit asking, "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DumbComments/?ref=doscher.com" rel="noreferrer">what do you use it for</a>?".  The battery one hit home for me though- the original kit had a battery that could handle the high amperage of a booting Raspberry Pi, but it disappeared off Amazon shortly before I published the post.  I was worried that it was a safety issue or recall, so I had to omit it.  I'm using a much larger battery this time, and I think I have a good approach for the new builds- more on that in a bit.</p><p><strong>The keyboard</strong>.  The original keyboard is the <a href="https://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/what-is-an-ortholinear-keyboard/?ref=doscher.com" rel="noreferrer">ortho</a> style for one major reason beyond looks- ANSI keyboards are just too wide to fit in the lid of a Pelican 1300 case- maybe a 40% might but that's asking too much of people.  The height of the lid was a real issue ergonomically too-typing on a keyboard surrounded by a lid's lip like that is not fun.  On top of that, the original Plaid keyboard wasn't programmed when it shipped, and the instructions for programming the chip were... not written well.  That made it really hard to recommend.  I have a newer pre-built keyboard that will lose me points with the handmade crowd, but hopefully this is easier for people to use.  Keyboards are still tough though- they don't stay in stock for long.</p><p><strong>The original Recovery Kit wiring</strong>.  Just look at it!</p><figure><img src="https://www.doscher.com/content/images/2024/04/JAY01401.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.doscher.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/JAY01401.jpg 600w, https://www.doscher.com/content/images/2024/04/JAY01401.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Seriously- I love the look of that harness, but between that and a through-hole keyboard kit, each deck took more than 100 hours to print.  That made the deck too hard for most people new to soldering, but also too expensive for most people to buy commissions.  I am open for commissions on the new build through the end of June 2024- email me if you're interested!</p><p><strong>The handle.</strong>  That handle and the clevis joints making the ends of the handle just above the monitor would catch on the Pelican case, rotate, and damage the screen.  Not good, and the handle is barely usable there.  I have a better option this time though.</p><p><strong>The GPIO.</strong>  I actually still love these, but these connectors are also pretty hard to solder.  The new one uses crimps. The idea is still the same though- I want an easy way to access GPIO for custom add-on boards and devices.</p><h3 id="compromises"><strong>Compromises</strong></h3><p>While I think I have good options for the stuff I have covered so far, there are still a few compromises I needed to make this time.  Maybe these will be in a larger deck sometime?</p><p><strong>Screen Size.</strong>  The Raspberry Pi 7" Touchscreen display is laughably bad for a desktop, but pretty decent for a terminal.  That's why you see the RKV2's here sporting terminals.  You can run a desktop, but why?  One good reason is to launch your favorite SDR app.  I don't actually intend on using this with a window manager though- this will be the workhorse the original was intended to be, enabling other devices off-grid.</p><p><strong>Power controls.</strong>  With all the changes I made, there's not the room I once had for individual power toggles.  This time there's a simple push button for the Raspberry Pi 5's power switch, or a GPIO input for the Raspberry Pi 4.  Internally there's simple plug connectors- less glamorous but also easy to mod and use as needed.  Again, reducing the amount of solder here as much as I can- and this is the only solder joint!  While I am appreciative that we have a couple through-hole connectors, I would have really loved the Pi Foundation to use a connector for this.</p><p><strong>No x86</strong>.  Not yet!</p><h3 id="build-overview"><strong>Build Overview</strong></h3><p>With all the background info covered, let's get into the build.  The general concept is still the same, but with modern printers like the Bambu or other more open CoreXY printers, this is a pretty easy parts list to print.</p><figure><img src="https://www.doscher.com/content/images/2024/04/800X600-Video-3.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.doscher.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/800X600-Video-3.gif 600w, https://www.doscher.com/content/images/2024/04/800X600-Video-3.gif 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It goes together easy, but with a mix of M4, M3, and M2.5 screws.  No more M5 screws this time around, but an electric screwdriver is a must.  I ended up using a <a href="https://amzn.to/3VNQrry?ref=doscher.com" rel="noreferrer">Hoto</a> and the bits from my <a href="https://amzn.to/4au2DCn?ref=doscher.com" rel="noreferrer">iFixit Mako Driver Kit</a> - the tools are also linked at the end of the article.</p><figure><img src="https://www.doscher.com/content/images/2024/04/JAY00264-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.doscher.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/JAY00264-1.jpg 600w, https://www.doscher.com/content/images/2024/04/JAY00264-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I also used <a href="https://us.store.bambulab.com/collections/petg/products/petg-cf?ref=doscher.com" rel="noreferrer">Bambu's own Carbon Fiber PETG</a>.  Either Pelican or Orchestra changed their dye color since the original Recovery Kit, and it wasn't a good match this time.</p><p><strong>Network Switch</strong>- the same reliable 5 port gigabit switch is here, but has been press-fit into place this time- the accuracy of Fusion 360 and the repeatability of the Bambu X1C has let me really dial in this printer- so no ugly boot on the back holding the switch to the frame.</p><p><strong>Ethernet</strong> - Of course Ethernet is making an appearance!  This time we're using a slightly more expensive passthrough from McMaster Carr, but I'm hoping to skip the drama I ran into with the Quick Kit of parts shortages.  If you haven't used McMaster Carr you should check it out- their website is an amazing collection of industrial parts complete with visual references and specs for each part.</p><p><strong>GPIO</strong> is back again, but far more condensed this time to make room for the battery.  It took some squeezing but there are plenty of GPIO pins to re-use, and I am happy to say the connector is from McMaster Carr, but the crimpers are far cheaper off Amazon, and will be linked at the end of the article.  With crimpers on some extra long silicone jumper wires, they are easy to move around- I will probably add labels though, since I don't quite have the variety of cable colors that I did last time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.doscher.com/content/images/2024/04/JAY00253-2.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.doscher.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/JAY00253-2.jpg 600w, https://www.doscher.com/content/images/2024/04/JAY00253-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>USB-C connectors are all over this build, and it could be cleaner- but with a few zip ties or fabric cable ties, this build actually comes apart pretty easy.  There's a couple key things to keep in mind:</p><ul>
<li>The USB-C power on the Power Bank is "smart" and will not see the Pi or network switch when the battery is first turned on, so you have to unplug and re-plug the USB-C connector on the battery.  A custom circuit may be better in the future, but considering we're using off the shelf parts, this is a compromise I had to make.</li>
<li>There are two USB-C ports that map back to the USB ports on the Pi.  You can easily "hotwire" one of them with a USB-C female-to-female adapter and make one a power port for the whole system.  There's a ton of options here, and it turned out to be really helpful building this system.</li>
<li>My setup uses right angle USB-A to USB-C connectors, and those might block the other ports- if you need all four Pi USB ports, you may need a few more adapters.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="https://www.doscher.com/content/images/2024/04/JAY00266.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.doscher.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/JAY00266.jpg 600w, https://www.doscher.com/content/images/2024/04/JAY00266.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now for the good stuff- the NVME and the battery!  This system is able to run a full NVME drive as the boot drive AND do it all from battery.  I intentionally have space around the battery and vents at the top of the enclosure, but the system runs great at normal room temps.  With a black enclosure I don't recommend leaving this in the sun.  Jeff Geerling has a <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/nvme-ssd-boot-raspberry-pi-5?ref=doscher.com" rel="noreferrer">great writeup</a> including the commands needed to boot from the NVME.  </p><figure><img src="https://www.doscher.com/content/images/2024/04/JAY00265.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.doscher.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/JAY00265.jpg 600w, https://www.doscher.com/content/images/2024/04/JAY00265.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>The DSI cable</strong> (in copper above).</p><p>This DSI cable has got to be one of the things I like least about the direction the Pi Foundation has gone.  Simply put, the new connector for the CSI (camera)/ DSI (display) ports is smaller, requiring a new cable.  Here's the catch though- it's physically the same size as a million of them on Amazon and Ali Express, but the only one I found to work was purchased from the Pi website/vendors... and there's a specific cable just for the displays, and another specific cable for the cameras.  This is not something that's easy to find at the time I write this.</p><figure><img src="https://www.doscher.com/content/images/2024/04/JAY00252.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.doscher.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/JAY00252.jpg 600w, https://www.doscher.com/content/images/2024/04/JAY00252.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The Power Button.  This is one of my favorites, it really adds a nice touch and helps for a quick shutdown, but really you can rewire it to GPIO if you want, especially if you plan to use a Pi4 since only the Pi5 has the solder points for the button.  In a pinch you could also print your own part and use this as a radio connector too if you're doing an internal SDR.  There are mounting posts and a frame for mounting an internal SDR if you want, but for now on this build it's a humble power button with a nice click to it.</p><figure><img src="https://www.doscher.com/content/images/2024/04/JAY00273.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.doscher.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/JAY00273.jpg 600w, https://www.doscher.com/content/images/2024/04/JAY00273.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Let's talk about the battery. I am using the <a href="https://amzn.to/3PXZuT4?ref=doscher.com" rel="noreferrer">Shargeek Storm 2</a> 100W, 25,600mAh power bank. Aside from doing the normal autosense that all smart banks do, this one has really held up well!  Even with the NVME it boots up fine and runs great- some builds of Raspberry Pi OS complained breifly about undervoltage, but I think that's an artifact of how the Pi5 tests- the screen showed that the Pi5 never came close to the battery's limits.  If you're going to keep this in log term storage, unplug the USB connector from the battery, or remove it altogether- the whole frame comes out with just a few screws.</p><p>The big downer is that we can't charge and use this battery at the same time- so that "hotwiring" of a USB-C port really helps here.</p><p>the Keyboard is our last stop before covering the parts list.  It's a <a href="https://drop.com/buy/planck-mechanical-keyboard/?ref=doscher.com" rel="noreferrer">Drop/OLKB Planck v7</a>.  This is a kit available as no-solder and I am using the white-on-black keys here.  While you can use the stock case, I made one a little bit wider that can wedge into the lid.  This leaves it tucked away for convenience and travel, but can pop out on a desk for daily usage.</p><figure><img src="https://www.doscher.com/content/images/2024/04/JAY00270.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.doscher.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/JAY00270.jpg 600w, https://www.doscher.com/content/images/2024/04/JAY00270.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The Recovery Kit Version Two took quite some time, and I'd like to thank my subscribers for supporting me with this build.  Paid members will have access to the post on my site that contains the STL files for this build, and the CAD members will have access to the Fusion 360 design files.  Monthly membership with access to the STL files for all my builds starts at just $5 a month, but the annual membership is heavily discounted and really helps me out.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24128363/google-cjpa-news-removal-california">https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24128363/google-cjpa-news-removal-california</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40014892">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Google says it will start removing links to California news websites in a “short term test for a small percentage of California users.” The move is in response to the pending California Journalism Preservation Act (CJPA), which would require Google to pay a fee for linking Californians to news articles. </p><p>“If passed, CJPA may result in significant changes to the services we can offer Californians and the traffic we can provide to California publishers,” Jaffer Zaidi, Google VP of global news partnerships, <a href="https://blog.google/products/news/california-journalism-preservation-act-puts-news-ecosystem-at-risk/">wrote in a blog post</a> announcing the decision. “The testing process involves removing links to California news websites, potentially covered by CJPA, to measure the impact of the legislation on our product experience.”</p><p>Zaidi adds that Google will also pause “further investments in the California news ecosystem,” referring to initiatives like <a href="https://news.google.com/news-showcase/">Google News Showcase</a>, product and licensing programs for news organizations, and the <a href="https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/">Google News Initiative</a>.</p><p>The conflict centers on Google’s impact on journalism. As it stands, Google (as well as Meta) receives a much larger cut of online advertising than publishers. An <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2023/06/14/saving_the_news_from_big_tech_eff.pdf">Electronic Frontier Foundation report</a> notes that half of every ad dollar gets eaten up by fees, while subscriptions are subject to app store taxes. </p><p>Supporters argue the California bill gives publishers leverage to make profit sharing more equitable. Google alleges that it already drives traffic to publishers and that this sort of legislation favors media conglomerates at the risk of further hollowing out local papers. </p><p>Complicating matters, it’s difficult to put a number on how much money Google makes from news. Technically, it doesn’t host ads on Google News, but media companies argue that linking out to news content benefits the platform more broadly. A <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24129986/paying-for-news.pdf">2023 study</a> estimates that Google would owe US publishers around $10 to 12 billion annually should the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/673">Journalism Competition and Preservation Act</a> — a national bill — come into effect.</p><p>This is not the first time that Google has opposed attempts from legislators to force it to pay media outlets for news. In 2014, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/11/7375733/google-news-spain-shutdown">pulled out of Spain</a> after a similar measure was passed but eventually returned <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-news-re-opens-spain-after-eight-year-shutdown-2022-06-22/">after an eight-year absence</a> in 2022. The company also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243468/google-threatens-to-remove-its-search-engine-from-australia-if-new-law-goes-into-effect">threatened to pull out of Australia entirely</a> back in 2020 when the country introduced <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/by-industry/digital-platforms-and-services/news-media-bargaining-code/news-media-bargaining-code">the News Media Bargaining Code</a>. Ultimately, Google caved and cut a deal with several Australian publishers — and Australia’s success led other countries like the <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/news/journalism-competition-and-preservation-act/">US</a>, <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/news/uk-government-force-google-meta-pay-for-news/">UK</a>, <a href="https://thehill.com/business/4334064-google-pay-74m-to-canadian-news-outlets/#:~:text=Google%20agrees%20to%20pay%20%2474M%20to%20Canadian%20news%20industry%20under%20law,-by%20Lauren%20Sforza&amp;text=Google%20reached%20a%20deal%20with,outlets%20to%20share%20their%20articles.">Canada</a>, and <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/mediawatch/audio/2018822197/new-collective-bid-to-make-tech-titans-pay-for-nz-news">New Zealand</a> to pursue similar legislation. </p></div></div>]]></description>

But in the 2 year STEM extension, it seems that you need a distinct supervisor to fill out I-983.<p>How do you suggest that a "solo entrepreneur" modify their business structure so that they can continue working on their business projects during the STEM OPT period? I've heard some people say that you need to have US Citizen co-owners of the company who own a majority share; others say that it suffices to have US Citizens on the Board, as this technically gives them the ability to remove you. Is there any such setup that is clearly within the bounds of the STEM OPT program?</p><p>Also - are there any other options aside from the STEM OPT extension? In particular, if the individual is from an E2 treaty country, is this the sort of business that could qualify for an E2 visa, or do those businesses have to have the potential to employ US Citizens?

E2s don't lead to a green card or US citizenship, but you may find a USC/PR spouse or another path while saving some capital.<p>Either E2 or EB-5 will have significant fees associated with them. Typical EB5 "administration/syndication" fees will run $80,000. You may be able to reduce this by going to the EB-5 Project directly and negotiating.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/11/hospital_website_data_sharing/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/11/hospital_website_data_sharing/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40012466">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Hospitals – despite being places where people implicitly expect to have their personal details kept private – frequently use tracking technologies on their websites to share user information with Google, Meta, data brokers, and other third parties, according to research published today.</p>
<p>Academics at the University of Pennsylvania analyzed a nationally representative sample of 100 non-federal acute care hospitals – essentially traditional hospitals with emergency departments – and <a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2817444">their findings</a> were that 96 percent of their websites transmitted user data to third parties.</p>
<p>Additionally, not all of these websites even had a privacy policy. And of the 71 percent that did, 56 percent disclosed specific third-party companies that could receive user information.</p>

    

<p>"It's shocking, and really kind of incomprehensible," said Dr Ari Friedman, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, who – along with Matthew McCoy, Angela Wu, Sam Burdyl, Yungjee Kim, Noell Kristen Smith, and Rachel Gonzales – authored the paper.</p>

        


        

<p>"People have cared about health privacy for a really, really, really long time," Friedman noted in an interview with <em>The Register</em>. "It's very fundamental to human nature. Even if it's information that you would have shared with people, there's still a loss, just an intrinsic loss, when you don't even have control over who you share that information with."</p>
<blockquote>

<p>There's an intrinsic loss when you don't even have control over who you share that information with&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers' latest work builds on a study they <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2022.01205?journalCode=hlthaff&amp;journalCode=hlthaff">published</a> a year ago of 3,747 US non-federal hospital websites. That found 98.6 percent tracked and transferred visitors' data to large tech and social media companies, advertising firms, and data brokers.</p>
<p>To find the trackers on websites, the team checked out each hospitals' homepage on January 26 using <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/agilemobiledev/webXray">webXray</a>, an open source tool that detects third-party HTTP requests and matches them to the organizations receiving the data. They also recorded the number of third-party cookies per page.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Who is viewing your data?</h3>
<p>One name in particular stood out, in terms of who was receiving website visitors' information.</p>
<p>"In every study we've done, in any part of the health system, Google, whose parent company is Alphabet, is on nearly every page, including hospitals," Friedman observed.</p>
<p>"From there, it declines," he continued. "Meta was on a little over half of hospital webpages, and the Meta Pixel is notable because it seems to be one of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/18/facebook_tracking_data/">grabbier entities</a> out there in terms of tracking."</p>

        

<p>Both Meta and Google's tracking technologies have been the subject of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/11/meta_youtube_criminal_charges/">criminal complaints</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/16/google_abortion_tracking_suit/">lawsuits</a> over the years – as have some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/03/ftc_online_counseling_betterhelp/">healthcare companies</a> that shared data with these and other advertisers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, between 20 and 30 percent of the hospitals share data with Adobe, Friedman noted. "Everybody knows Adobe for PDFs. My understanding is they also have a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/advertising/search-social-commerce/tracking/conversion-tracking/conversion-tracking-analytics">tracking division</a> within their ad division."</p>
<p>Others include telecom and digital marketing companies like The Trade Desk and Verizon, plus tech giants Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon, according to Friedman. Then there's also analytics firms including Hotjar and data brokers such as Acxiom.</p>

        

<p>"And two thirds of hospital websites had some kind of data transfer to a third-party domain that we couldn't even identify," he added.</p>
<p>Of the 71 hospital website privacy policies that the team found, 69 addressed the types of user information that was collected. The most common were IP addresses (80 percent), web browser name and version (75 percent), pages visited on the website (73 percent), and the website from which the user arrived (73 percent).</p>
<p>Only 56 percent of these policies identified the third-party companies receiving user information.</p>
<p>While this puts hospital website visitors at risk of having their data collected and shared with others that they may not want, it also poses a risk to the hospitals themselves, the researchers noted.</p>
<p>Hospitals aren't legally required to publish website privacy policies that detail how they collect visitors' data and with whom they share it. But if they do have a privacy policy, they better make sure their processes on deleting personal information upon request, for example, follow the government polices – or they could face the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/15/infosec_in_brief/">wrath</a> of regulators like the Federal Trade Commission.</p>

</ul>
<p>"Websites that collect specific categories of information from certain users may also be subject to other federal and state-specific requirements in terms of data collection and notice," the paper warns.</p>
<p>"While the suit against Mass General Brigham and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute was brought under Massachusetts law, plaintiffs have brought similar class action lawsuits in multiple states."</p>
<p>Mass General Brigham ended up paying an <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.hipaajournal.com/mass-general-brigham-settles-cookies-without-consent-lawsuit-for-18-4-million/">$18.4 million settlement</a> to resolve a class action lawsuit that alleged the institutions shared personally identifiable information about patients to Facebook, Google, and other companies.</p>
<h3>A fundamental rethink</h3>
<p>Of course, the data privacy threat extends beyond hospital websites, as&nbsp; Friedman is quick to point out.</p>
<p>"Why do hospitals have tracking on their webpages?" he wondered. "It's not that they're taking kickbacks from Google and Acxiom, data brokers and advertisers and social media companies that sell their patients' data in exchange for money.</p>
<p>"They're doing it because this stuff is ubiquitous across the whole web. They're doing it because there's an entire tens of billions of dollars ad economy."</p>
<p>While it presents a major challenge for healthcare providers in general and hospitals specifically, it's also an opportunity.</p>
<p>"Many hospitals are academic hospitals and have computer science departments that they could collaborate with, and design new tools and startups, which is something universities are good at doing," Friedman noted. "Build a new web that doesn't involve as much tracking.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, and in lieu of any <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/09/us_federal_privacy_law_apra/">federal data privacy law</a> in the US, protecting personal information falls to the individual. And for that,&nbsp; Friedman recommends browser-based tools Ghostery and Privacy Badger, which identify and block transfers to third-party domains.</p>
<p>"It impacts your browsing experience almost none," he explained. "It's free. And you will be shocked at how much tracking is actually happening, and how much data is actually flowing to third parties." ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
		

		<p>I've posted many times before about paid search engine Kagi but I really wanted, like I have with other sites in the past, to make a post that just outlines why I don't have any faith in it.  Because the majority of my reasons come from being in their Discord, which tons of average users will never really look at, and I suspect a lot of Kagi supporters do not know a lot of this backstory.  This isn't a heavily researched deep dive or anything, I feel like I always need these kind of disclaimers when I'm just posting my thoughts about something backed up with my reasons for thinking it...it's just a quick rundown of why I personally went from a Kagi subscriber to a Kagi Naysayer, so that I can have my reasons in one place that I can link others to.  And I have seen a lot of people recommend Kagi that I personally know would be a lot less interested in doing so if they knew this information, but they don't because it's not readily apparent just from using the site.</p>

		<p>For those unfamiliar to start with, Kagi is a paid search engine that purportedly focuses on privacy.  It's meant to be a no-nonsense platform focused on being the best search it can be.  Frankly, I think at this point it's a very nonsense-focused platform that has an extremely disinterested view of privacy, and I think it's not a particularly sustainable project either.</p>

		<p>First of all, as a project, Kagi stretches itself way too thin.  "Kagi" isn't just Kagi Search, it's also a whole slew of AI tools, a Mac-only web browser called Orion, and right now they are planning on launching an email service as well.  None of these projects are particularly profitable, so it's not a case of one subsidizing the other, and when they announced Kagi Email even their most dedicated userbase (aka the types who hang around in a discord for a search engine) seemed largely disinterested.  For products this niche, I don't think you can afford to be running multiple niche products at once.  Your developers are going to be running far too ragged to keep them all going.  Last I could find Kagi employs about 16 employees, half full time.  Presumably not every single one of those 8 or so full timers are web devs.  That's not a lot of people to throw at this many things.</p>

		<p><a href="https://blog.kagi.com/celebrating-20k">Oh and they own a t-shirt factory.</a></p>

		<p>You see, when Kagi had a funding round and raised about $670k.  This funding came from an investment round including "42 accredited investors, most of whom are actual Kagi users".  Unfortunately unlike Cohost I can't give any kind of huge financial breakdown here, because Kagi's finances are even less transparent.  If there are Kagi financial reports, I haven't seen them, just the occasional Discord comment from Kagi employees.  A while back they raised their prices, which lost them a lot of subscribers, because they were losing money per search at the old prices.  They were actually still losing money per search on the new prices.  They eventually lowered the prices back down a bit (and maybe raised them again?  I've completely lost the plot on their pricing at this point) and have claimed that at 25,000 users they would be breaking even.  I am unsure what happened in all of this for this math to be true, but my point is that they did in fact reach at least 20,000 users, and to celebrate they set up a business entity in Germany (they are currently US based), in order to start a tiny little t-shirt printing company.  And their goal was to print 20,000 t-shirts to give out, FOR FREE, to their first 20,000 users (with users paying only shipping costs).  But I cannot stress enough, they did not just spend money on 20,000 tshirts to give out, they set up a whole new business entity in Germany to run their own t-shirt printing operation, with its own building and warehouse and employee(s? I get the sense it's one guy but I don't know).  And this cost them 1/3 of their $670k funding round.  One, fucking, third.  For t-shirts.  Did I mention that the t-shirts don't even have the Kagi name on them?  Just the Kagi dog mascot, who is at this point the only thing I like about Kagi, to the point where if I wasn't worried people would try to talk to me about Kagi I'd opt for one of the shirts myself.  Great artist, whoever did this.  Terrible financial choice to start a whole t-shirt business to make 20,000 free t-shirts that do not even get your name out there.</p>

		<img src="https://d-shoot.net/img/kagi/breakeven.png" alt="Discord convo, quoting @tkataja saying 'of course I don't know about the financial situation of the company now and then, but', and Vlad replies on 01/28/2024 'we are almost breakeven, at 25k subs we should be'"> <br>
		<img src="https://d-shoot.net/img/kagi/salaries.png" alt="Discord convo, quoting @HKayn saying 'Is Kagi actually operating at a loss atm?', dev Thomas replies on 09/29/2023 'So we price our plans for them to be slightly profitable on a revenue - cost per search basis, but for now there aren't enough of you for that to fully offset R&amp;D expenses (eg. salaries, etc...).  You can help by getting your friends on :)"> <br>
		<img src="https://d-shoot.net/img/kagi/employees.png" alt="Discord convo on 05/23/2023.  Vlad: 'we are not sustainable yet but we are able to pay search and infrastructure cost after revenue from subscriptions.  Since there is a surplus there it is a matter of scaling the number of users now to also pay for the salaries.  That should happen around 20k customers.'  Grooty: 'how many employees do you currently have?' Raymyn: 'Thanks for the response.  Definitely looking forward to the future of Kagi. You guys are definitely the first product I have used in awhile that I am more than willing to throw money at a subscription for.  Hoping you guys hit the 20k mark soon, and grow to 100k, 1 million, or more in the near future!'  Vlad, replying to Grooty: '~16, roughly half of them are full time'"> 

		<p>T-shirt companies aside, there's one other thing about Kagi's finances that was revealed recently in an update stream they did that caught my attention--Kagi was not paying sales tax for two years and they finally have to pay up.  They just...didn't do it.  Didn't think it was important?  I have no idea why.  Their reactions made it sound like they owed previous taxes, not that they just now had to pay them.  They genuinely made it sound like they only just now realized they needed to figure out sales tax.  It's a baffling thing to me and it meant a change in prices for users that some people were not thrilled with.</p>

		<img src="https://d-shoot.net/img/kagi/kagisalestax.png" alt="Kagi slide that says 'Also, sales tax/vat...' with a graph of the world, plus sign, and graph of an unreadable graph, with an equal sign saying 'we need to pay sales taxes'.  Then 'Implementing now - updates in the next few weeks, expect changes in January"> <br>
		<img src="https://d-shoot.net/img/kagi/taxes.png" alt="Discord screenshot from 03/19/2024, Vlad says 'To clarify, this means an end-price increase for affected members (sales tax/VAT will be automatically added on top of Kagi price, if applicable in their country/state) and this is mandated by Kagi becoming large enough to have legal sales tax/VAT obligation.  In addition, Kagi will have to retroactively pay for all sales tax/VAT that we did not collect in the last almost two years.  We have chosen to absorb this on behalf of our customers.'"> 

		<p>But let's say that you can live with their financial issues.  They'll either survive or they won't and you'll just enjoy the ride.  Yet, there's a lot of reasons that I can't just enjoy the ride either.  I think the ride is going to get worse and worse in ways the casual users haven't really noticed yet because of how much of it is in beta or just Ideas That Vlad (the founder of Kagi) Had.  And most of them are surrounding AI.  I have to assume a lot of people don't understand how deep the AI rabbithole for Kagi goes, because I have seen people recommend Kagi to people frustrated with Google's own AI bullshit.  If AI is the thing you are trying to get away from, moving to Kagi is a lateral move at best.</p>

		<p>As it turns out, Kagi was <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-ai-search">founded originally as an AI company</a>, who later pivoted to search.  And going by their comments in their Discord, AI tools seem to be what they spend most of their time on these days.  They're launching AI features left and right, and they have fully bought into AI being the future of search.  They believe that by embracing AI, that will be the thing that sets their product apart (kinda late now) and get them the kind of userbase that can keep them afloat financially.  They have <a href="https://kagi.com/fastgpt">"FastGPT"</a>, where their focus is having a ChatGPT style service that is focused on being fast, not accurate.  And boy, it sure isn't, I messed around with this for a while and it very confidently gave me a lot of extremely inaccurate information about old sitcoms.  But of course, it's all stuff where if you didn't already know the answer to the question you asked you wouldn't know it was wrong--like when I asked it about the All in the Family episode Cousin Liz, it kept identifying the woman Edith and Archie are talking to in the episode as Cousin Liz, but Cousin Liz is instead Edith's deceased cousin who they were attending a funeral for.  Following a theme I asked it more broadly about homosexuality in All in the Family and it spit out a bunch of text repeatedly saying that Lionel Jefferson was gay.  But I guess it did spit all of this wrong information at me faster than some of the alternatives!  I wrote more about this experience on <a href="https://hackers.town/@lori/110420844338899624">fedi</a>, even though the content warning says ChatGPT this was done with Kagi's FastGPT, I was just trying to keep the thread simple at the time.</p>

		<p>Like most search now Kagi has chosen to include Instant Answers that are AI generated, which means they're often wrong, as well as a <a href="https://kagi.com/summarizer/index.html">"Universal Summarizer"</a> tool, that again is more of the same old AI bullshit.  There's also a beta tool called Kagi Assitant, which I...don't know what's really different about it than the other AI stuff they're doing, I think it has a chatbot mode?  I believe you have to be a subscriber to see this.  It's getting increasingly hard to tell some of these services apart.  There's also another <a href="https://sidekick.kagi.com/">beta feature called Sidekick</a> that puts Kagi AI stuff as a sidebar on your own website.  There was some demo where you could put someone's Twitter handle in and it would give you a summary of who that person was (nightmare shit).  But the developers of Kagi fully believe that this is what search engines should be, a bunch of AI tools so that you don't even need to read primary sources anymore.  If AI is your problem with Google or Bing, Kagi is in no way a solution for you.  Kagi loves AI bullshit and they are going to find more and more ways to use it.  If you check out their Discord and listen to founder Vlad talk about AI tools, it's clear that he will not listen to anyone saying they might be bad in any way.  To the point where he truly believes that <a href="https://twitter.com/vladquant/status/1647017761569402882">AI should be used to remove bias from news articles</a>, and show you which articles are "constructive" or "good" to view.  This is something he legitimately wants to implement and he seems completely oblivious to the fact that this is not something AI can do, that AI spits out exactly as much bias as it is fed in its model.  He's 100% a true believer in AI as unbiased. (Note in the below screenshots: freediver is Vlad's HackerNews account)</p>

		<img src="https://d-shoot.net/img/kagi/personsummary.png" alt="Discord screenshot from 12/05/2022, Vlad says 'now something like this is super useful...we can make the AI read through 50 web pages in mere seconds, after doing 5 searches (that it decides on!), to at the end produce a summary of someone based on just a twitter handle.  Total cost for this is maybe 6-7 cents but it just saved me 10 minutes?' Vlad includes a screenshot of the search for a user named @scottleibrand, which shows a ChatGPT-style generated summary with links to the sites it used, the text is a bit too small for me to transcribe."> <br>

		<img src="https://d-shoot.net/img/kagi/unbiasedreviews.png" alt="Hackernews screenshot, malikNF says ''> Kagi shopping results have no affiliate links and feature the most helpful, unbiased reviews' Wonder how they determine if a review is unbiased or not.  Any attempt at automating this process means someone else will figure a way to game the system over time.' Vlad replies (as freediver) 'Which is why we cannot say how, but please check and let us know if the reviews sound unbiased :)'"> <br>

		<img src="https://d-shoot.net/img/kagi/constructivenews.png" alt="Discord convo from 12/05/23.  Vlad: 'Real balanced news would not discriminate between left and right, but between constructive and destructive.''  ram ram: 'it just so happens the left/right divide correlates strongly with true/false and constructive destructive' the last envoy quoting ram ram: 'I agree' Vlad: 'Interesting, that is implicitly saying that one political option is the source of truth' Ram ram: 'Not at all, it's explicitly saying that one political option is supported by truth.' Vlad: 'but news should not be only about politics?' Ram ram: 'All things are political in nature.' Vlad: 'A coffee shop opening in your town?' Ram ram: 'Business licensing, source of beans, employment practices, building regulation, city ordonances, taxes, food health and safety'"> <br>

		<img src="https://d-shoot.net/img/kagi/constructivenews2.png" alt="Discord convo from 12/05/23.  Vlad: 'line of thought basically comes from here https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli, embed for the Guardian article 'News is bad for you - and giving up reading it will make you happier. News is bad for you, it leads to fear and aggression. It hinders your creativity and makes you sick.  We should stop consuming it, says Rolf Dobelli, who's abstained for years.'  Vlad continues: 'then you ask a question how does a product that makes news constructive to your life (vs irrelevant/destructive)'"> 

		<p>It's honestly impossible to write this without discussing Vlad a little bit.  Vlad is very "my way or the highway", but is the type that will try to appear very measured and calm while completely unwilling to budge.  And he is very, very much the type that believes "not everything is political" and "we don't get into politics".  I won't get into all of the Brave stuff because many people have written about this already, but the <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/2808-reconsider-your-partnership-with-brave">support thread</a> about it should give you some ideas.  His personal conception of bias is a guiding factor in a lot of Kagi's decisions but it's frankly ridiculous.  For example, he has stated before that he thinks 3 star reviews on products are "by definition" unbiased, because they must include good and bad points.  Nevermind that a lot of people's reviews of the recent Star Wars films were "good space war stuff but too many minorities in it".  At one point someone <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/865-suicide-results-should-probably-have-a-dont-do-that-widget-like-google">suggested the idea that searching for suicide-related terms should bring up a helpline</a>, and he rejected that idea because it would be "biased" (I guess towards not wanting people to kill themselves).  But at the same time, Kagi partners with a service called <a href="https://www.looria.com/">Looria</a> to provide "unbiased reviews" on products in Kagi's shopping page.  Nevermind that unbiased reviews do not exist (there is just a difference between a sincere review and a paid advertisement), but isn't promoting certain products in search at least as biased as telling people to not commit suicide?  You're letting a third party decide what reviews your users should see.</p>

		<p>And Vlad's attitude is also where Kagi's dedication to privacy falls apart for me.  Generally, if someone brings up a security or privacy concern, Vlad's response is either "trust me bro" or "that's not actually important".  He has repeatedly stated that he feels less than 100 people on earth need full anonymity in a search engine (he has never, that I could find, explained where he got this number or idea from).  He believes that email addresses don't count as personally identifiable information, because you can simply use a burner account.  If you say that you wouldn't want Kagi using information from your theoretical Kagi Email Address in your search results, and would rather have a Proton-style privacy focused email?  He says that there's nothing to worry about, Kagi wouldn't do anything bad with your data.  If you bring up "what if Kagi gets sold to someone else?"  He says well, if they sold to someone who did something bad with your data, they'd lose all of their privacy focused customers, so clearly they'd never do that.  Basically anything where you say "I don't want someone to have this data about what I'm doing in a search engine", his reply is "well, we wouldn't do anything with this information."  A lot of questions about what information Kagi collects on people is met with either saying nothing (which isn't true, they connect your account to an email address for payments, since it's a paid service), or saying he isn't sure, or saying it doesn't matter because they won't use it anyway.  Asking what data Stripe collects on them through Kagi, and more importantly what data Stripe sends back TO Kagi, also gets you a vague "I don't know" answer.  He doesn't entertain any discussions about GDPR because he thinks they have nothing that applies anyway.  Questions about what would happen if the government tried to force him to collect information about users are just brushed away with "well we'd simply close the company", although he also notes that he has no problem with criminals being caught through their searches and doesn't want criminals using the platform.</p>

		<img src="https://d-shoot.net/img/kagi/weregood1.png" alt="Discord convo from 02/15/2024, Zack: 'That's not actually the only thing I'm asking.  Was also curious about more of the intricacies.  I would use stripe, I wouldn't opt for bitcoin anyway.'  Vlad: 'the point is we do not really want, need or care about your data.  We just need $10/mo from you to run the service.  How you provide it to use is a technical detail as far as we're concerned.  Zack:  I know that you don't want/need/care.  I was more curious about the actual reality when using stripe, that's all.  I will delve more into the stripe policies another time though!"><br>
		<img src="https://d-shoot.net/img/kagi/weregood2.png" alt="Discord convo.  Heero, replying to Vlad asking 'what is missing?': 'GDPR Data download link. Where to get the data that is collected.' Heero replying to their own post saying 'Something you could do about this false time stamps?' with 'But this is more important for me, cry laughing emoji, it's just annoying when sites cheat like that' Vlad: Kagi does not collect any personal information' Kai: eh, you technically need to provide a download link to a CSV with the email address' Vlad: our payment processor does, and you can ask stripe for that'"><br>
		<img src="https://d-shoot.net/img/kagi/weregood3.png" alt="Discord convo, Heero replying to Vlad saying 'kagi does not collect any personal information: 'You have an account, with mail and billing. This is already personal information in the sense of GDPR, winking emoji.  Heero replying to vlad saying 'Well even email address is not personal information the way kagi does it as you can enter anything', Heero says 'That's actually I think not important' Heero replies to Kai saying 'GDPR is stupid that way' with 'Yes, I agree'.  Vlad replies 'personal information is what you can be identified with as an individual.  No information you submit to kagi is personal information except if you use your real email address to register. So a data download link would download a file that contains your email address.  Heero replies 'Yes, and then you need to provide the data associated with you.  That includes personal preference settings for search optimization I would think, no expert on this though.'"><br>
		<img src="https://d-shoot.net/img/kagi/weregood4.png" alt="Discord convo, Heero replying to Vlad asking 'can you clarify what is sensitive?': 'Sensitive data is private information that, if exposed without permission, can lead to harm or misuse.  Inputting websites that should be preferred or not preferred is highly sensitive.  That shows a bit of a disconnect between data protection and you.  Though I really don't want to blame you, could be more that I actually live in germany and we take such stuff far to serious :D' Vlad: We do not collect/extract this information but the user volunteers it.  As such it is not clear how is it sensitive in terms of privacy protection.' Heero: The thread model here would be something like that: I prefer websites that are pro trans or anti trans, you see the profile and the settings i have set, you see the mail too.'"><br>
		<img src="https://d-shoot.net/img/kagi/weregood5.png" alt="Discord convo, Heero: your not really following GDPR standards.  You don't understand what sensitive data means (to be fair, I don't know if you really do :) ). Even if I can input wrong data, you can't verify that, as such you need to always take it as sensitive, personal, private data.  Also, giving you data volunteerly isnt a thing in GDPR, the source of the data is not important.  So, my concern is, I don't know what you really track, as you don't give me a copy of my data.  I don't know if your obligated to, it's just things I as european citizen expect.' Vlad: (quoting 'your not really following DPR standards') You say these things but you do not really provide evidence for it :) So again, can you clearly articulate what your concern is?  We very well know what personal information is and what GDPR was made for. (quoting 'i don't know what you really track') We have very detailed privacy policy where this is literally written.  Have you read it and still do not know what we track?'  Heero: 'Did I make it clearer know? I really want to stress that I don't have anything against you or kagi :) just trying to be constructive.'"><br>

		<img src="https://d-shoot.net/img/kagi/readingemails.png" alt="Discord convo from 03/31/2024, Gohan: Just the thought of kagi search having the ability to go through my emails would keep me far away from using the email product'  Vlad: 'as I said, it would be opt in, we will need to be able to search email as a product feature anyway' Gohan: That's why I said even having the ability to do so is a massive turn off' Vlad: exposing it in search results is a benefit, not sure why you would think that?' Gohan: 'because if you give any company an inch, they'll take a mile', Vlad: 'not Kagi, I think you may be misunderstanding how would this work and what incentives in play'"><br>

		<img src="https://d-shoot.net/img/kagi/anonymity.png" alt="Discord convo from 07/15/22, Vlad: people who really need anonymity are very rare.  Probably less than a 100 in the entire world.  Definitely not typical Kagi users.  Unless they are criminals, in which case we don't care they don't have full anonymity (nor we want them as customers)'">

		<p><i>I want to note with the above, I'm not a GDPR expert either, I don't know what counts legally and what doesn't, but I strongly disagree with Vlad's handwaving of the issue and his insistence that email addresses aren't PII because you can use a fake one, because that's true for names and almost any other information as well, that logic doesn't hold up for this, and the logic is what I have the issue with.</i></p>		

		<p>Between the absolute blase attitude towards privacy, the 100% dedication to AI being the future of search, and the completely misguided use of the company's limited funds, I honestly can't see Kagi as something I could ever recommend to people.  Is the search good?  I mean...it's not really much better than any other search, it heavily leverages Bing like DDG and the other indie search platforms do, the only real killer feature it has to me is the ability to block domains from your results, which I can currently only do in other search engines via a user script that doesn't help me on mobile.  But what good is filtering out all of the AI generated spamblogs on a search platform that wants to spit more AI generated bullshit at me directly?  Sure I can turn it off, but who's to say that they won't start using my data to fuel their own LLM?  They already have an extremely skewed idea of what counts as PII or not.  They could easily see using people's searches as being "anonymized" and decide they're fine to use, because their primary business isn't search, it's AI.  They just don't want to admit to being an AI company anymore.  Frankly, it's not something I want to pay them to keep developing.  It's something I want less of out in the world.  Do you need to quit using Kagi?  That's up to you.  I'm not really trying to debate anyone into leaving Kagi.  My only interest is to explain why my opinion shifted on it, and to share information that may or may not shift your opinions.  If they don't, it's not something I want to debate people into.  But I think most of the info here is going to be news to a lot of people, and that's the thing.  Most people aren't going to dig into the discord for a project and read what the developers have said about it over time, that's a bonkers thing to do that I did, just do what you will with my findings.  Because I know for a fact, from talking to people, that a lot of Kagi users don't know any of this.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2024/04/12/use-renovate/">https://www.jvt.me/posts/2024/04/12/use-renovate/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40011111">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've read my blog before, or interacted with me at work or in the Open Source world, you're likely to know that I'm a huge fan of <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/">Renovate</a>.</p><p>For those that aren't aware, Renovate is one of the big players in dependency updating tooling, commonly seen in comparisons with Dependabot or Snyk.</p><p>I've been using Renovate for the last ~5 years, alongside a mix of Dependabot and Snyk to keep me grounded. I <em>absolutely love</em> Renovate, and make a point of making it so I can run Renovate where possible.</p><p>I've also had the experience operating Renovate in self-hosted mode as well as used <a href="https://developer.mend.io/">the hosted Renovate app by Mend</a> and the Mend Enterprise SAAS, and <a href="https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/jvt.me/-/issues/1349">plan to</a> blog about the lessons learned self-hosting Renovate.</p><p>Renovate has some really key features that set it apart from the competition, and I'm sure in the time it's taken me to write this, they've shipped some new ones 😻</p><p>(Aside: I'm largely writing this blog post now, as I've recently been shouting the benefits of Renovate, and instead of writing another internal-only document at work (as I did at Deliveroo), I wanted to <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2017/06/25/blogumentation/">write it as a form of blogumentation</a>).</p><h2 id="prior-art">Prior art</h2><p>A few years back, I wrote about <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2021/09/26/whitesource-renovate-tips/">some tips for using Renovate</a> to make keeping your software up-to-date easier, which I still stand by.</p><p>Since then, I've worked across a number of different ecosystems, repository sizes, and levels of comfort merging dependency updates, and have learned a few more things about effectively using Renovate - but through it, I'm still very sure of Renovate being the best tool in the ecosystem.</p><h2 id="configurability">Configurability</h2><p>Renovate is <em>extremely</em> configurable, with <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/">dozens of configuration options</a> to tune your experience. But Renovate doesn't end up being "too" configurable, where you end up spending more time tweaking config than doing the changes, but configurable enough that it's very likely you can do what you need to with it.</p><p>This is something that really hit me when we were rolling out Dependabot at Deliveroo, where my team owned ~30 repositories, and so for each of these repos, we needed to hand-craft a <code>dependabot.yml</code>, as Dependabot needs to be told which directories contain which dependencies, and how often to update them.</p><p>After we'd had about a week of usage, we started needing to tweak the configuration in a few of them to reduce the noise, which then required us to raise PRs across all the repos and get them updated.</p><p>Because Dependabot requires a bit of a snowflake configuration per repository, this wasn't easily automatable, even with <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/01/21/bulk-git-repo-changes/">great tools available to automate some of the bulk updates</a>, which made this a rather onerous and frustrating process.</p><p>Compare this to Renovate, where there's an excellent first-class support for <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/">shareable config presets</a>, in which you can "extend" multiple configuration(s).</p><p>This allows a team that wants to have consistency (i.e. in how often they receive updates to the AWS and Google Cloud SDKs, or which labels they want on PRs) to create a shared preset for their team that defines this. Then, each of their repositories can "extend" this configuration, as well as defining their own configuration on top of it at a repo-specific level.</p><p>This also makes it possible to provide good guardrails for your organisation, providing a good set of defaults, such as a <code>base.json</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"$schema"</span><span>:</span> <span>"https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json"</span><span>,</span>

</span></span><span><span>    <span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>]</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This then allows defining a somewhat opinionated good starting point for teams with a <code>default.json</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"$schema"</span><span>:</span> <span>"https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json"</span><span>,</span>

</span></span><span><span>  <span>]</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, teams only need to set the following in their repos' <code>renovate.json</code>, and they'll have the benefits of onboarding with a lot of the hard work done with starting:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"$schema"</span><span>:</span> <span>"https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json"</span><span>,</span>

</span></span><span><span>  <span>]</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And that's it 👏</p><h2 id="good-defaults">Good defaults</h2><p>Linking back to the comment about having to hand-craft <code>dependabot.yml</code>s, the great thing about Renovate is that there's some great defaults, and that it can autodetect the ecosystems your repo uses, and appropriately raises PRs.</p><p>This ease of onboarding is truly excellent, and you can even have <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/getting-started/installing-onboarding/#repository-onboarding">an onboarding PR</a> raised to your repos to make it even simpler.</p><p>For instance, at Deliveroo, we made it so <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/01/30/renovate-global-defaults/">there was a default set of configuration for all repos</a> to give us an easy means to update Docker images, but then if teams wanted to manage everything, they could add a <code>renovate.json</code>, and it'd be more fully featured.</p><p>Additionally, Renovate comes with some great inbuilt configuration in the form of presets, including <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/upgrade-best-practices/">a "best practices" guide</a> and associated preset, which makes it easier to keep on top of community best practices, without needing to bikeshed about what you think is best.</p><p>If you find that <code>config:best-practices</code> is a little too much, there's <code>config:recommended</code> as a starting point, and you can always downgrade or exclude rules you'd prefer not to follow. Or if you <em>really</em> want to control things <code>config:base</code> is the minimum you should pull in.</p><h2 id="grouping">Grouping</h2><p>As suggested above, it's possible to tune how different packages get updated, where you can <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/noise-reduction/#package-grouping">group multiple updates into a single PR</a>.</p><p>For instance, let's say that you use 9 different AWS services in your application, and instead of receiving 9 PRs every time there are updates across the SDKs, you want a single one. In this case, you could craft the following Renovate configuration:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"$schema"</span><span>:</span> <span>"https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json"</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"packageRules"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>"groupName"</span><span>:</span> <span>"aws-sdk-go"</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>"matchPackagePatterns"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
</span></span><span><span>	<span>"^github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2"</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>]</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>]</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>What's great about this is that you can also bundle things like all patch updates into a single PR:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"packageRules"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is something that's <a href="https://github.blog/2023-08-24-a-faster-way-to-manage-version-updates-with-dependabot/">recently</a> been added to Dependabot, which is great, cause Renovate's had it for years 😝</p><h2 id="use-for-one-off-bumps">Use for one-off bumps</h2><p>Because Renovate is an Open Source tool you can run on the command-line, it means you can <em>also</em> get the ability to use <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2022/12/12/renovate-one-off/">Renovate for one-off executions</a>, for instance to get everyone in your organisation to a minimum version of a given dependency, or just to do an infrequently performed set of updates.</p><p>Something I always refer back to is the fact that Renovate has a <em>tonne</em> of supported package managers, package ecosystems and versioning tools.</p><p>Renovate's <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/bot-comparison/">bot comparison guide docs</a> has a good example which links out to the differences between:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/">What platforms Renovate supports</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates#supported-repositories-and-ecosystems">What platforms Dependabot supports</a></li></ul><p>As Dependabot is more focussed on being used on GitHub's platforms (citation needed?) support for things like CircleCI, GitLab CI or other competitors' tooling doesn't seem to be available.</p><h2 id="adding-support-for-additional-ecosystems">Adding support for additional ecosystems</h2><p>One of the things you'll be used to having from your dependency update tool of choice is your standard package manager support, where it'll update a <code>go.mod</code> or a <code>pom.xml</code> in your repositories.</p><p>But one thing that's quite important to understand is that there are <em>many more</em> dependencies in your project than those installed in your package manager. Something I find great about Renovate is that, as well as managing <code>Dockerfile</code>s, <code>build.gradle</code>s, <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code>, etc, it will <em>also</em> manage things your <code>.ruby-version</code> or configuration for the ASDF version manager.</p><p>But what about some of the non-standard, or organisation-specific means for tracking versions?</p><p>For instance, installing the <code>golangci-lint</code> linting tool recommends using <code>curl | sh</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="makefile"><span><span><span>$(GOBIN)/golangci-lint</span><span>:</span>
</span></span><span><span>	curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh <span>|</span> sh -s -- -b <span>$(</span>GOBIN<span>)</span> v1.57.2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And it's common for <code>Dockerfile</code>s to have a definition of the version of dependencies:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="docker"><span><span><span>ARG</span> <span>MONGODB_VERSION</span><span>=</span><span>6</span>.0.4<span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Or what if you have a custom deployment configuration like:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="yaml"><span><span><span># this is an (imaginary) company specific deployment configuration file</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>application</span><span>:</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>  </span><span>lb</span><span>:</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>image</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>uk-tooling/load-balancer@v3.0.0</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>It's very unlikely that you have these supported by other tools out-of-the-box, and Renovate is the same.</p><p>But Renovate <em>does</em> give you the ability to manage these versions yourself.</p><p>Using Renovate's <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/regex/">custom managers</a> we can craft a configuration file such as:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"$schema"</span><span>:</span> <span>"https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json"</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"regexManagers"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>"fileMatch"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>"^Makefile$"</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>"matchStrings"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>"curl .*https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s -- .* (?&lt;currentValue&gt;.*?)\\n"</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>],</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>"depNameTemplate"</span><span>:</span> <span>"github.com/golangci/golangci-lint"</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span>"datasourceTemplate"</span><span>:</span> <span>"go"</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>]</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And this will allow us to manage the <code>golangci-lint</code> installation.</p><p>Ideally, this sort of configuration may make it upstream so Renovate can do it out-of-the-box, but as we can see from the above example, there may be things that are organisation- or repo-specific, and so having it upstream'd doesn't make sense.</p><h2 id="because-you-can-do-more-with-it">Because you can do more with it</h2><p>And you can do even more with it - I've mentioned you can use it for one-off updates on the command-line, but for instance I've also written a tool <a href="https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/renovate-graph">renovate-graph</a> which takes the detected dependency data from Renovate and gives you a JSON blob you can consume.</p><p>This underpins a large swathe of the power behind <a href="https://dmd.tanna.dev/">dependency-management-data</a> and can be used for other means, such as <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/11/03/renovate-to-sbom/">converting Renovate data exports to a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)</a>.</p><h2 id="dependency-dashboard">Dependency Dashboard</h2><p>One thing I love about Renovate is that you can enable the <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/key-concepts/dashboard/">Dependency Dashboard</a>, which gives you an overview of the detected dependencies, open PRs, as well s anything that may be waiting, or has failed to update.</p><p>This is a hugely useful insight into the at-a-glance how far behind are we on updates, giving a view of whether you maybe want to spend a bit more time focussing on updates, or looking at ways to cut through the noise.</p><p>When you merge a PR into your default branch, Renovate will rebase open PRs, so they're easier to review, and are guaranteed to run against the latest changes. However, if you're not getting to your updates as often as changes are going in, you may have a tonne of PRs constantly building, which is a waste of energy and CI minutes.</p><p>Instead, you can use the Dependency Dashboard for its ability to i.e. <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/key-concepts/dashboard/#require-approval-for-major-updates">require major bumps be gated behind a manual approval</a>, as it's likely you'll need some human interaction for that PR, and can then only raise it when you're actually ready to deal with it.</p><h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2><p>A very important factor to me is that Renovate is Open Source, and open to community contributions.</p><p>Although it's probably best to be split into another article, I love the AGPL3, and it's a great way of making sure that anyone hosting Renovate as a platform makes sure that their users get the access to the source code.</p><p>Alternatively, Snyk is proprietary, and Dependabot is source available (or at a stretch "open source" not "Open Source") with <a href="https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core?tab=readme-ov-file#license">a license</a> that doesn't even appear on the SPDX license list.</p><p>Renovate is also brilliantly set up as a community project, where they're shipping hundreds of PRs a month, alongside managing the community really well. I've seen a few things change in the last few years I've been more actively contributing, and it's a really well run project and an indication of something I'd love to be able to replicate at some point!</p><p>It also helps that <a href="https://mend.io/">Mend</a>, the company behind Renovate, invests a fair bit of time and money into development of the project, as well as their commercial offerings on top of it, which continue to make the project sustainable and remain Free and Open.</p><h2 id="great-documentation">Great documentation</h2><p>Following on from the excellent community and maintainer contributions alike, there's also some really excellent work on a technical writing and documentation point of view, which makes a lot of tasks straightforward to solve.</p><p>If there's something a little more complex or custom than the docs can offer, it's usually something that can be answered by the community in a GitHub Discussion, and likely could turn into a docs improvement, if necessary.</p><p>There's even a great <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/bot-comparison/">comparison table between Renovate and other dependency update bots</a>, as well as <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/upgrade-best-practices/">tips on how best to update your projects</a>.</p><p>I've recently discovered a few pages and features that I wasn't aware, just by going through the docs.</p><h2 id="overall">Overall</h2><p>In summary, there's just so much that makes Renovate a greater choice than any of the alternatives, and I'm sure I could talk about more things that make it great.</p><p>Whether you self-host it for maximum control (such as being able to access internal artifact registries), or run the hosted app for ease of operations, or just run it from the command-line once in a while, it can be hugely useful to your experience as an engineer.</p><p>I hope you'll check it out!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About FyneDesk</h2><a id="user-content-about-fynedesk" aria-label="Permalink: About FyneDesk" href="#about-fynedesk"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">FyneDesk is an easy to use Linux/Unix desktop environment following material design.
It is built using the <a href="https://fyne.io/" rel="nofollow">Fyne</a> toolkit and is designed to be
easy to use as well as easy to develop. We use the Go language and welcome
any contributions or feedback for the project.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Wu5k0xZOI" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c5ec8d0872591d16a6c580efac3d6add1512ff0ce0e10252dbae8da1ec93f4a0/68747470733a2f2f696d672e796f75747562652e636f6d2f76692f38325775356b30785a4f492f302e6a7067" alt="FyneDesk v0.4" data-canonical-src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/82Wu5k0xZOI/0.jpg"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dependencies</h2><a id="user-content-dependencies" aria-label="Permalink: Dependencies" href="#dependencies"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compiling</h3><a id="user-content-compiling" aria-label="Permalink: Compiling" href="#compiling"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Compiling requires the same dependencies as Fyne. See the <a href="https://developer.fyne.io/started/" rel="nofollow">Getting Started</a> documentation for installation steps.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Running</h3><a id="user-content-running" aria-label="Permalink: Running" href="#running"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For a full desktop experience you will also need the following external tools installed:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>arandr</code> for modifying display settings</li>
<li><code>xbacklight</code> or <code>brightnessctl</code> for laptop brightness</li>
<li><code>connman-gtk</code> is currently used for configuring Wi-Fi network settings</li>
<li><code>compton</code> for compositor support</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The desktop does work without the runtime dependencies but the experience will be degraded.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting Started</h2><a id="user-content-getting-started" aria-label="Permalink: Getting Started" href="#getting-started"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Using standard Go tools you can install FyneDesk using:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="go get fyshos.com/fynedesk/cmd/fynedesk"><pre><code>go get fyshos.com/fynedesk/cmd/fynedesk
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will add <code>fynedesk</code> to your $GOPATH (usually ~/go/bin).
You can now run the app in "preview" mode like any other Fyne app.
Doing so is not running a window manager, to do so requires another few steps:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setting up as a desktop environment</h3><a id="user-content-setting-up-as-a-desktop-environment" aria-label="Permalink: Setting up as a desktop environment" href="#setting-up-as-a-desktop-environment"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To use this as your main desktop you can run the following commands to set up
fynedesk as a selectable desktop option in your login manager (such as LightDM for example):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/fyshos/fynedesk
cd fynedesk
make
sudo make install"><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/fyshos/fynedesk
cd fynedesk
make
sudo make install
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can now log out and see that it is in your desktop selection list at login.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Debugging a window manager</h3><a id="user-content-debugging-a-window-manager" aria-label="Permalink: Debugging a window manager" href="#debugging-a-window-manager"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can also run the window manager components in an embedded X window for testing.
You will need the <code>Xephyr</code> tool installed for your platform (often installed as part of Xorg).
Once it is present you can use the following command from the same directory as above:</p>

<p dir="auto">It should look like this:</p>
<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/FyshOS/fynedesk/blob/master/desktop-dark-current.png"><img src="https://github.com/FyshOS/fynedesk/raw/master/desktop-dark-current.png" alt="Fyne Desktop - Dark"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">If you run the command when there is a window manager running, or on
an operating system that does not support window managers (Windows or
macOS) then the app will start in UI test mode.
When loaded in this way you can run all of the features except the
controlling of windows - they will load on your main desktop.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Runner</h2><a id="user-content-runner" aria-label="Permalink: Runner" href="#runner"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A desktop needs to be rock solid, and whilst we are working hard to get there,
any alpha or beta software can run into unexpected issues.
For that reason, we have included a <code>fynedesk_runner</code> utility that can help
manage unexpected events. If you start the desktop using the runner, then
if a crash occurs, it will normally recover where it left off with no loss
of data in your applications.</p>
<p dir="auto">Using standard Go tools you can install the runner using:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="go get fyshos.com/fynedesk/cmd/fynedesk_runner"><pre><code>go get fyshos.com/fynedesk/cmd/fynedesk_runner
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">From then on execute that instead of the <code>fynedesk</code> command for a more
resilient desktop when testing out pre-release builds.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Design</h2><a id="user-content-design" aria-label="Permalink: Design" href="#design"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Design concepts, and the abstract wallpapers have been contributed by <a href="https://github.com/jostgrant">Jost Grant</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Shipping FyneDesk</h2><a id="user-content-shipping-fynedesk" aria-label="Permalink: Shipping FyneDesk" href="#shipping-fynedesk"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you are installing FyneDesk by default on a distribution, or making it available as a standard option, you should consider the following points.
You do not need to ship the library or any dependencies, but it is recommended to add the following apps as well:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>app</th>
<th>go get</th>
<th>description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>fin</td>
<td><code>github.com/fyshos/fin</code></td>
<td>A display manager app that matches the look and feel of FyneDesk</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p dir="auto">Please do let us know if you package FyneDesk for your system, so we can include a link from here :).</p>
