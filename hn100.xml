<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><div><p>By <!-- -->John James</p><p>Published on <!-- -->December 14, 2025</p><p>Read time ~3 min</p></div></header><p>I’ve used GraphQL, specifically Apollo Client and Server, for a couple of years in a real enterprise-grade application.</p><p>Not a toy app. Not a greenfield startup. A proper production setup with multiple teams, BFFs, downstream services, observability requirements, and real users.</p><p>And after all that time, I’ve come to a pretty boring conclusion:</p><p>GraphQL solves a real problem, but that problem is far more niche than people admit. In most enterprise setups, it’s already solved elsewhere, and when you add up the tradeoffs, GraphQL often ends up being a net negative.</p><p>This isn’t a “GraphQL bad” post. It’s a “GraphQL after the honeymoon” post.</p><h3>what GraphQL is supposed to solve</h3><p>The main problem GraphQL tries to solve is overfetching.<br>The idea is simple and appealing:</p><ul><li>the client asks for exactly the fields it needs</li><li>no more, no less</li><li>no wasted bytes</li><li>no backend changes for every new UI requirement</li></ul><p>On paper, that’s great. In practice, things are messier.</p><h3>overfetching is already solved by BFFs</h3><p>Most enterprise frontend architectures already have a BFF (Backend for Frontend).</p><p>That BFF exists specifically to:</p><ul><li>shape data for the UI</li><li>aggregate multiple downstream calls</li><li>hide backend complexity</li><li>return exactly what the UI needs</li></ul><p>If you’re using REST behind a BFF, overfetching is already solvable. The BFF can scope down responses and return only what the UI cares about.</p><p>Yes, GraphQL can also do this. But here’s the part people gloss over.<br>Most downstream services are still REST.</p><p>So now your GraphQL layer still has to overfetch from downstream REST APIs, then reshape the response. You didn’t eliminate overfetching. You just moved it down a layer.<br>That alone significantly diminishes GraphQL’s main selling point.</p><p>There is a case where GraphQL wins here. If multiple pages hit the same endpoint but need slightly different fields, GraphQL lets you scope those differences per query.<br>But let’s be honest about the trade.</p><p>You’re usually talking about saving a handful of fields per request, in exchange for:</p><ul><li>more setup</li><li>more abstraction</li><li>more indirection</li><li>more code to maintain</li></ul><p>That’s a very expensive trade for a few extra kilobytes.</p><h3>implementation time is much higher than REST</h3><p>GraphQL takes significantly longer to implement than a REST BFF.</p><p>With REST, you typically:</p><ul><li>call downstream services</li><li>adapt the response</li><li>return what the UI needs</li></ul><p>With GraphQL, you now have to:</p><ul><li>define a schema</li><li>define types</li><li>define resolvers</li><li>define data sources</li><li>write adapter functions anyway</li><li>keep schema, resolvers, and clients in sync</li></ul><p>GraphQL optimizes consumption at the cost of production speed.<br>In an enterprise environment, production speed matters more than theoretical elegance.</p><h3>observability is worse by default</h3><p>This one doesn’t get talked about enough.<br>GraphQL has this weird status code convention:</p><ul><li>400 if the query can’t be parsed</li><li>200 with an <code>errors</code> array if something failed during execution</li><li>200 if it succeeded or partially succeeded</li><li>500 if the server is unreachable</li></ul><p>From an observability standpoint, this is painful.</p><p>With REST:</p><ul><li>2XX means success</li><li>4XX means client error</li><li>5XX means server error</li></ul><p>If you filter dashboards by 2XX, you know those requests succeeded.<br>With GraphQL, a 200 can still mean partial or full failure.</p><p>Yes, Apollo lets you customize this behavior. But that’s kind of the point. You’re constantly paying a tax in extra configuration, extra conventions, and extra mental overhead just to get back to something REST gives you out of the box.</p><p>This matters when you’re on call, not when you’re reading blog posts.</p><h3>caching sounds amazing until you live with it</h3><p>Apollo’s normalized caching is genuinely impressive.</p><p>In theory. In practice, it’s fragile.</p><p>If you have two queries where only one field differs, Apollo treats them as separate queries. You then have to manually wire things so:</p><ul><li>existing fields come from cache</li><li>only the differing field is fetched</li></ul><p>At that point:</p><ul><li>you still have a roundtrip</li><li>you’ve added more code</li><li>debugging cache issues becomes its own problem</li></ul><p>Meanwhile, REST happily overfetches a few extra fields, caches the whole response, and moves on. Extra kilobytes are cheap. Complexity isn’t.</p><h3>the ID requirement is a leaky abstraction</h3><p>Apollo expects every object to have an <code>id</code> or <code>_id</code> field by default, or you need to configure a custom identifier.</p><p>That assumption does not hold in many enterprise APIs.</p><p>Plenty of APIs:</p><ul><li>don’t return IDs</li><li>don’t have natural unique keys</li><li>aren’t modeled as globally identifiable entities</li></ul><p>So now the BFF has to generate IDs locally just to satisfy the GraphQL client.</p><p>That means:</p><ul><li>more logic</li><li>more fields</li><li>you’re always fetching one extra field anyway</li></ul><p>Which is ironic, considering the original goal was to reduce overfetching.</p><p>REST clients don’t impose this kind of constraint.</p><h3>file uploads and downloads are awkward</h3><p>GraphQL is simply not a good fit for binary data.</p><p>In practice, you end up:</p><ul><li>returning a download URL</li><li>then using REST to fetch the file anyway</li></ul><p>Embedding large payloads like PDFs directly in GraphQL responses leads to bloated responses and worse performance.</p><p>This alone breaks the “single API” story.</p><h3>onboarding is slower</h3><p>Most frontend and full-stack developers are far more experienced with REST than GraphQL.</p><p>Introducing GraphQL means:</p><ul><li>teaching schemas</li><li>teaching resolvers</li><li>teaching query composition</li><li>teaching caching rules</li><li>teaching error semantics</li></ul><p>That learning curve creates friction, especially when teams need to move fast.</p><p>REST is boring, but boring scales extremely well.</p><h3>error handling is harder than it needs to be</h3><p>GraphQL error responses are… weird.</p><p>You have:</p><ul><li>nullable vs non-nullable fields</li><li>partial data</li><li>errors arrays</li><li>extensions with custom status codes</li><li>the need to trace which resolver failed and why</li></ul><p>All of this adds indirection.</p><p>Compare that to a simple REST setup where:</p><ul><li>input validation fails, return a 400</li><li>backend fails, return a 500</li><li>zod error, done</li></ul><p>Simple errors are easier to reason about than elegant ones.</p><h3>the net result</h3><p>GraphQL absolutely has valid use cases.</p><p>But in most enterprise environments:</p><ul><li>you already have BFFs</li><li>downstream services are REST</li><li>overfetching is not your biggest problem</li><li>observability, reliability, and speed matter more</li></ul><p>When you add everything up, GraphQL often ends up solving a narrow problem while introducing a broader set of new ones.<br>That’s why, after using it in production for years, I’d say this:</p><p>GraphQL isn’t bad. It’s just niche. And you probably don’t need it.</p><p>Especially if your architecture already solved the problem it was designed for.</p></article></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://borretti.me/article/hashcards-plain-text-spaced-repetition">https://borretti.me/article/hashcards-plain-text-spaced-repetition</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46264492">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><a href="https://github.com/eudoxia0/hashcards">hashcards</a> is a local-first <a href="https://borretti.me/article/effective-spaced-repetition">spaced repetition</a> app, along the lines of
<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> or <a href="https://mochi.cards/">Mochi</a>. Like Anki, it uses <a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-fsrs-in-100-lines">FSRS</a>, the most advanced scheduling
algorithm yet, to schedule reviews.</p>

<p>The thing that makes hashcards unique: it doesn’t use a database. Rather, your
flashcard collection is just a directory of Markdown files, like so:</p>

<div><pre><code>Cards/
  Math.md
  Chemistry.md
  Astronomy.md
  ...
</code></pre></div>

<p>And each file, or “deck”, looks like this:</p>

<div><pre><code>Q: What is the role of synaptic vesicles?
A: They store neurotransmitters for release at the synaptic terminal.

Q: What is a neurite?
A: A projection from a neuron: either an axon or a dendrite.

C: Speech is [produced] in [Broca's] area.

C: Speech is [understood] in [Wernicke's] area.
</code></pre></div>

<p>You write flashcards more or less like you’d write ordinary notes, with
lightweight markup to denote basic (question/answer) flashcards and <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#cloze-deletion">cloze
deletion</a> flashcards. Then, to study, you run:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ hashcards drill &lt;path to the cards directory&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>This opens a web interface on <code>localhost:8000</code>, where you can review the
flashcards. Your performance and review history is stored in an <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>
database in the same directory as the cards. Cards are content-addressed, that
is, identified by the hash of their text.</p>

<p>This central design decision yields many benefits: you can edit your flashcards
with your editor of choice, store your flashcard collection in a <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> repo,
track its changes, share it on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> with others (<a href="https://github.com/eudoxia0/flashcards">as I have</a>). You can
use scripts to generate flashcards from some source of structured data (e.g. a
CSV of English/French vocabulary pairs). You can query and manipulate your
collection using standard Unix tools, or programmatically, without having to dig
into the internals of some app’s database.</p>

<p>Why build a new spaced repetition app? Mostly because I was dissatisfied with
both Anki and Mochi. But also, additionally, because my flashcards collection is
very important to me, and having it exist either in some remote database, or as
an opaque unusable data blob on my computer, doesn’t feel good. “Markdown files
in a Git repo” gives me a level of ownership that other approaches lack.</p>

<p>The rest of this post explains my frustrations with Anki and Mochi, and how I
landed on the design decisions for hashcards.</p>

<h2 id="anki">Anki</h2>

<p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> was the first SR system I used. It’s open source, so it will be around
forever; it has a million plugins; it was the first SR system to use <a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-fsrs-in-100-lines">FSRS</a> for
scheduling. It has really rich stats, which I think are mostly useless but are
fun to look at. And the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#note-types">note types</a> feature is really good: it lets you
generate a large number of flashcards automatically from structured data.</p>

<p>The central problem with Anki is that the interface is really bad. This
manifests in various ways.</p>

<p>First, it is ugly to look at, particularly the review screen. And this
diminishes your enjoyment of what is already an often boring and frustrating
process.</p>

<p>Second, doing simple things is hard. A nice feature of Mochi is that when you
start the app you go right into review mode. You’re drilling flashcards before
you even realize it. Anki doesn’t have a “study all cards due today”, rather,
you have to manually go into a deck and click the “Study Now” button. So what I
would do is put all my decks under a “Root” deck, and study that. But this is a
hack.</p>

<p>And, third: card input uses WYSIWYG editing. So, you’re either jumping from the
keyboard to the mouse (which increases latency, and makes flashcard creation
more frustrating) or you have to remember all these keybindings to do basic
things like “make this text a cloze deletion” or “make this <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/math.html">TeX math</a>”.</p>

<p>Finally, plugins are a double-edged sword. Because having the <em>option</em> to use
them is nice, but the experience of <em>actually</em> using most plugins is bad. The
whole setup feels janky, like a house of cards. Most of the time, if a feature
is not built into the app itself, I would rather live without it than use a plugin.</p>

<h2 id="mochi">Mochi</h2>

<p><a href="https://mochi.cards/">Mochi</a> feels like it was built to address the main complaint about Anki: the
interface. It is intuitive, good looking, shortcut-rich. No jank. Instead of
WYSIWYG, card text is Markdown: this is delightful.</p>

<p>There’s a few problems. While Markdown is a very low-friction way to write
flashcards, cloze deletions in Mochi are very verbose. In hashcards, you can
write this:</p>

<div><pre><code>Speech is [produced] in [Broca's] area.
</code></pre></div>

<p>The equivalent in Mochi is this:</p>

<div><pre><code>Speech is {{1::produced}} in {{2::Broca's}} area.
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is a lot of typing. And you might object that it’s only a few characters
longer. But when you’re studying from a textbook, or when you’re copying words
from a vocabulary table, these small frictions add up. If writing flashcards is
frustrating, you’ll write fewer of them: and that means less knowledge
gained. Dually, a system that makes flashcard creation as frictionless as
possible means more flashcards, and more knowledge.</p>

<p>Another problem is that Mochi doesn’t have an equivalent of Anki’s <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#note-types">note
types</a>. For example: you can make a note type for chemical elements, with
fields like atomic number, symbol, name, etc., and write templates to generate
flashcards asking questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the atomic number of [name]?</li>
  <li>What element has atomic number [number]?</li>
  <li>What is the symbol for [name]?</li>
  <li>What element has symbol [symbol]?</li>
</ul>

<p>And so on for other properties. This is good. Automation is good. Less work,
more flashcards. Mochi doesn’t have this feature. It has <a href="https://mochi.cards/docs/#templates">templates</a>, but
these are not as powerful.</p>

<p>But the biggest problem with Mochi, I think, is the algorithm. Until <a href="https://x.com/MochiCardsApp/status/1924692507570667630">very
recently</a>, when they added beta support for FSRS, the algorithm used by
Mochi was even simpler than <a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-sm2-in-rust">SM-2</a>. It was based on <a href="https://mochi.cards/docs/faq/#which-spaced-repetition-algorithm-does-mochi-use">multipliers</a>:
remembering a card multiplies its interval by a number &gt;1, forgetting a card
multiplies its interval by a number between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>The supposed rationale for this is simplicity: the user can reason about the
algorithm more easily. But I think this is pointless. The whole point of an SR
app is the software manages the schedule for you, and the user is completely
unaware of how the scheduler works. The optimality is to have the most advanced
possible scheduling algorithm (meaning the one that yields the most recall for
the least review time) under the most intuitive interface possible, and the user
just reaps the benefits.</p>

<p>Obviously without an RCT we can’t compare Mochi/<a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-sm2-in-rust">SM-2</a>/FSRS, but my subjective
experience of it is that the algorithm works well for the short-term, and
falters on the long-term. It’s very bad when you forget a mature card: if a card
has an interval of sixty days, and you click forget, you don’t reset the
interval to one day (which is good, because it helps you reconsolidate the lost
knowledge). Rather, the interval is multiplied by the forget multiplier (by
default: 0.5) down to <em>thirty days</em>. What’s the use? If I forgot something after
sixty days, I surely won’t have better recall in thirty.</p>

<p>You can fix this by setting the forget multiplier to zero. But you have to know
this is how it works, and, crucially: I don’t want to configure things! I don’t
want “scheduler parameter finetuning” to be yet another skill I have to acquire:
I want the scheduler to <em>just work</em>.</p>

<p>In general, I think spaced repetition algorithms are too optimistic. I’d rather
see cards slightly more often, and spend more time reviewing things, than get
stuck in “forgetting hell”. But developers have to worry that making the system
too burdensome will hurt retention.</p>

<p>In Anki, it’s the interface that’s frustrating, but the algorithm works
marvelously. In Mochi, the interface is delightful, but it’s the algorithm
that’s frustrating. Because you can spend months and months drilling flashcards,
building up your collection, but when the cards cross some invisible age
threshold, you start to forget them, and the algorithm does not help you relearn
things you have forgotten. Eventually I burned out on it and stopped doing my
reviews, because I expected to forget everything eventually anyhow. And now they
added support for FSRS, but by now I have 1700 cards overdue.</p>

<p>Additionally: Mochi has only two buttons, “Forgot” and “Remembered”. This is
simpler for the user, yes, but most SR scheduling algorithms have more options
for a reason: different degrees of recall adjust the card parameters by
different magnitudes.</p>

<h2 id="hashcards">Hashcards</h2>

<p>What do I want from a spaced repetition system?</p>

<p>The first thing is: card creation must be frictionless. I have learned that the
biggest bottleneck in spaced repetition, for me, is not doing the reviews (I am
very disciplined about this and have done SR reviews daily for months on end),
it’s not even converting conceptual knowledge into flashcards, the biggest
bottleneck is just entering cards into the system.</p>

<p>The surest way to shore up your knowledge of some concept or topic is to write
more flashcards about it: asking the same question in different ways, in
different directions, from different angles. More volume means you see the same
information more often, asking in different ways prevents “memorizing the shape
of the card”, and it acts as a kind of redundancy: there are multiple edges
connecting that bit of knowledge to the rest of your mind.</p>

<p>And there have been many times where I have thought: I would make this more
solid by writing another flashcard. But I opted not to because the marginal
flashcard is too effortful.</p>

<p>If getting cards into the system involves a lot of friction, you write fewer
cards. And there’s an opportunity cost: the card you don’t write is a concept
you don’t learn. Integrated across time, it’s entire oceans of knowledge which
are lost.</p>

<p>So: the system should make card entry effortless. This was the guiding principle
behind the design of the hashcards text format. For example, cloze deletions use
square brackets because in a US keyboard, square brackets can be typed without
pressing shift (compare Mochi’s curly brace). And it’s one bracket, not
two. Originally, the format was one line per card, with blank lines separating
flashcards, and question-answer cards used slashes to separate the sides, like
so:</p>

<div><pre><code>What is the atomic number of carbon? / 6

The atomic number of [carbon] is [6].
</code></pre></div>

<p>And this is strictly less friction. But it creates a problem for multi-line
flashcards, which are common enough that they should not be a second-class
citizen. Eventually, I settled on the current format:</p>

<div><pre><code>Q: What is the atomic number of carbon?
A: 6

C: The atomic number of [carbon] is [6].
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which is only slightly more typing, and has the benefit that you can easily
visually identify where a card begins and ends, and what kind of card it is. I
spent a lot of time arguing back and forth with <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a> about what the optimal
format should be.</p>

<p>Another source of friction is not creating the cards but <em>editing</em> them. The
central problem is that your knowledge changes and improves over time. Often
textbooks take this approach where Chapter 1 introduces one kind of ontology,
and by Chapter 3 they tell you, “actually that was a lie, here’s the real
ontology of this subject”, and then you have to go back and edit the old
flashcards to match. Because otherwise you have one card asking, e.g., for the
undergraduate definition of some concept, while another asks you for the
graduate-level definition, creating ambiguity.</p>

<p>For this reason, when studying from a textbook, I create a deck for the
textbook, with sub-decks for each chapter. That makes it easy to match the
flashcards to their source material (to ensure they are aligned) and each
chapter deck only has a few tens of cards usually, keeping them navigable.</p>

<p>Sometimes you wrote multiple cards for the same concept, so you have to update
them all at once. Finding the related ones can be hard if the deck is large. In
hashcards, a deck is just a Markdown file. The cards immediately above and below
a card are usually semantically related. You just scroll up and down and make
the edits in place.</p>

<p>But why plain-text files in a Git repo? Why not use the above format, but in a
“normal” app with a database?</p>

<p>The vague idea of a spaced repetition system where flashcards are stored as
plain-text files in a Git repo had been kicking around my cranium for a long
time. I remember asking an Ankihead on IRC circa 2011 if such a thing
existed. At some point I read <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/My_implementation_of_a_personal_mnemonic_medium">Andy Matuschak’s note</a> on his
implementation of an SR system. In his system, the flashcards are colocated with
prose notes. The notation is similar to mine: <code>Q</code> and <code>A</code> tags for
question-answer cards, and <code>{curly braces}</code> for cloze deletions. And the cards
are content-addressed: identified by their hash. Which is an obviously good
idea. But his code is private and, besides, I feel that prose notes and
flashcards are very different beasts, and I don’t need or want them to mix.</p>

<p>But I think the idea of plain-text spaced repetition got bumped up the priority
queue because I spontaneously started using a workflow that was similar to my
current hashcards workflow.</p>

<p>When studying from a textbook or a website, I’d write flashcards in a Markdown
file. Usually, I used a shorthand like <code>[foo]</code> for cloze deletions. Then I’d use
a Python script to transform the shorthand into the <code>{{1::foo}}</code> notation used by Mochi. And I’d edit the flashcards in the file, as
my knowledge built up and my sense of what was relevant and important to
remember improved. And then, when I was done with the chapter or document or
whatever, only then, I would manually import the flashcards into Mochi.</p>

<p>And it struck me that the last step was kind of unnecessary. I was already
writing my flashcards as lightly-annotated Markdown in plain-text files. I had
<a href="https://borretti.me/article/implementing-fsrs-in-100-lines">already implemented FSRS</a> out of curiosity. I was looking for a
personal project to build during funemployment. So hashcards was by then a very
neatly-shaped hole that I just needed to paint inside.</p>

<p>It turns out that using plain-text storage has many synergies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can edit the cards using whatever editor you use, build up a library of
card-creating macros, and navigate the collection using the editor’s file
browser.</li>
  <li>You can query and update the collection using standard Unix tools, or a
programming language, e.g. using <code>wc</code> to get the total number of words in the
collection, or using <code>awk</code> to make a bulk-update to a set of cards.</li>
  <li>You can use Git for version control. Git is infinitely more featureful than
the change-tracking of any SR app: you can edit multiple cards in one commit,
branch, merge, use pull requests, etc.</li>
  <li>You can make your flashcards public on GitHub. I often wish people put more of
themselves out there: their blog posts, their dotfiles, their study notes. And
why not their flashcards? Even if they are not useful to someone else, there
is something enjoyable about reading what someone else finds interesting, or
enjoyable, or worth learning.</li>
  <li>You can generate flashcards using scripts (e.g., turn a CSV of foreign
language vocabulary into a deck of flashcards), and write a Makefile to tie
the script, data source, and target together. I <a href="https://github.com/eudoxia0/flashcards/blob/87b082e4723e5b1b286e3bb5378316f464cfc28f/Makefile">do this</a> in my
personal deck. Anki’s <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#note-types">note types</a> don’t have to be built into hashcards,
rather, you can DIY it using some Python and make.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result is a system where creating and editing flashcards is nearly
frictionless, that uses an advanced spaced repetition scheduler, and which
provides an elegant UI for drilling flashcards. I hope others will find it
useful.</p>

    <h2 id="ai-and-the-ironies-of-automation---part-2">AI and the ironies of automation - Part 2</h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/ironies_of_ai_1/">previous post</a>, we discussed several observations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironies_of_Automation">Lisanne Bainbridge</a> made in her much-noticed paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0005109883900468">“The ironies of automation”</a>, she published in 1983 and what they mean for the current “white-collar” work automation attempts leveraging LLMs and AI agents based on LLMs, still requiring humans in the loop. We stopped at the end of the first chapter, “Introduction”, of the paper.</p>
<p>In this post, we will continue with the second chapter, “Approaches to solutions”, and see what we can learn there.</p>
<h2 id="comparing-apples-and-oranges">Comparing apples and oranges?</h2>
<p>However, before we start: Some of the observations and recommendations made in the paper must be taken with a grain of salt when applying them to the AI-based automation attempts of today. When monitoring an industrial production plant, it is often a matter of seconds until a human operator must act if something goes wrong to avoid severe or even catastrophic accidents.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is of the highest importance to design industrial control stations in a way that a human operator can recognize deviations and malfunctions as easily as possible and immediately trigger countermeasures. A lot of work is put into the design of all the displays and controls, like, e.g., the well-known emergency stop switch in a screaming red color that is big enough to be punched with a flat hand, fist or alike within a fraction of a second if needed.</p>
<p>When it comes to AI-based solutions automating white-collar work, we usually do not face such critical conditions. However, this is not a reason to dismiss the observations and recommendations in the paper easily because, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most companies are efficiency-obsessed. Hence, they also expect AI solutions to increase “productivity”, i.e., efficiency, to a superhuman level. If a human is meant to monitor the output of the AI and intervene if needed, this requires that the human needs to comprehend what the AI solution produced at superhuman speed – otherwise we are down to human speed. This presents a quandary that can only be solved if we enable the human to comprehend the AI output at superhuman speed (compared to producing the same output by traditional means).</li>
<li>Most companies have a tradition of nurturing a culture of urgency and scarcity, resulting in a lot of pressure towards and stress for the employees. Stress is known to trigger the fight-or-flight mode (an ancient survival mechanism built into us to cope with dangerous situations) which massively reduces the normal cognitive capacity of a human. While this mechanism supports humans in making very quick decisions and taking quick actions (essential in dangerous situations), it deprives them of the ability to conduct any deeper analysis (not being essential in dangerous situations). If deeper analysis is required to make a decision, this may take a lot longer than without stress – if possible at all. This means we need to enable humans to conduct deeper analysis under stress as well or to provide the information in a way that eliminates the need for deeper analysis (which is not always possible).</li>
</ul>
<p>If we let this sink in (plus a few other aspects, I did not write down here but you most likely will add in your mind), we quickly come to the conclusion that also in our AI-related automation context humans are often expected to make quick decisions and act based on them, often under conditions that make it hard (if not impossible) to conduct any in-depth analysis.</p>
<p>If we then also take into account, that depending on the situation a wrong result produced by an AI solution which eluded the human operator may have severe consequences in the worst case (e.g., assume a major security incident due to a missed wrongdoing of the AI solution), the situation is not that far away anymore from the situation in an industrial plant’s control station.</p>
<p>Summarizing, we surely need to add the necessary grain of salt, i.e., ask ourselves how strict the timing constraints in our specific setting are to avoid comparing apples and oranges in the worst case. However, in general we need to consider the whole range of possible settings which will – probably more often than we think – include that humans need to make decisions in a very short time under stressful conditions (which makes things more precarious).</p>
<h2 id="the-worst-ui-possible">The worst UI possible</h2>
<p>This brings us immediately to Lisanne Bainbridge’s first recommendation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In any situation where a low probability event must be noticed quickly then the operator must be given artificial assistance, if necessary even alarms on alarms.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the system must support the human operator as well as possible in detecting a problem, especially if it tends to occur rarely. It is a consequence of the <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/ironies_of_ai_1/#monitoring-fatigue">“monitoring fatigue” problem we discussed in the previous post</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the learnings people have made, a lot of effort has been put into the design of the displays, the controls and also the alerting mechanisms of industrial production control stations, making sure the human operators can make their jobs as good, as stress-free and as reliable as possible.</p>
<p>Enter AI agents.</p>
<p>The usual idea is that a single human controls a fleet of AI agents that are designed to do some kind of job, e.g., writing code. Sometimes, most agents are generic “workers”, orchestrated by some kind of supervisor that delegates parts of the work to the worker agents. Sometimes, the different agents are “specialists”, each for a certain aspect of the job to be done, that collaborate using some kind of choreography (or are also orchestrated by a supervisor). While the generic workers are easier to set up, the specialized workers usually produce more accurate results.</p>
<p>Because these AI-based agents sometimes produce errors, a human – in our example a software developer – needs to supervise the AI agent fleet and ideally intervenes <em>before</em> the AI agents do something they should not do. Therefore, the AI agents typically create a plan of what they intend to do first (which as a side effect also increases the likelihood that they do not drift off). Then, the human verifies the plan and approves it if it is correct, and the AI agents execute the plan. If the plan is not correct, the human rejects it and sends the agents back to replanning, providing information about what needs to be altered.</p>
<p>Let us take Lisanne Bainbridge’s recommendation and compare it to this approach that is currently “best practice” to control an AI agent fleet.</p>
<p>Unless we tell them to act differently, LLMs and also AI agents based on them are quite chatty. Additionally, they tend to communicate with an air of utter conviction. Thus, they present to you this highly detailed, multi-step plan of what they intend to do, including lots of explanations, in this perfectly convinced tone. Often, these plans are more than 50 or 100 lines of text, sometimes even several hundred lines.</p>
<p>Most of the time, the plans are fine. However, sometimes the AI agents mess things up. They make wrong conclusions, or they forget what they are told to do and drift off – not very often, but it happens. Sometimes the problem is obvious at first sight. But more often, it is neatly hidden somewhere behind line 123: “… and because 2 is bigger than 3, it is clear, we need to &lt; do something critical &gt;”. But because it is so much text the agents flood you with all the time and because the error is hidden so well behind this wall of conviction, we miss it – and the AI agent does something critical wrong.</p>
<p>We cannot blame the person for missing the error in the plan. The problem is that this is probably the worst UI and UX possible for anyone who is responsible for avoiding errors in a system that rarely produces errors.</p>
<p>But LLM-based agents make errors all the time, you may say. Well, not all the time. Sometimes they do. And the better the instructions and the setup of the interacting agents, the fewer errors they produce. Additionally, we can expect more specialized and refined agents in the future that become increasingly better in their respective areas of expertise. Still, most likely they will never become completely error-free because of the underlying technology that cannot guarantee consistent correctness.</p>
<p>This is the setting we need to ponder if we talk about the user interface for a human observer: a setting where the agent fleet only rarely makes errors but we still need a human monitoring and intervening if things should go wrong. It is not yet clear how such an interface should look like, but most definitely not as it looks now. Probably we could harvest some good insights from our UX/UI design colleagues for industrial production plant control stations. We would need only to ask them …</p>
<h2 id="the-training-paradox">The training paradox</h2>
<p>Lisanne Bainbridge then makes several recommendations regarding the required training of the human operator. This again is a rich section, and I can only recommend reading it on your own because it contains several subtle yet important hints that are hard to bring across without citing the whole chapter. Here, I will highlight only a few aspects. She starts with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Some points made in the previous section] make it clear that it can be important to maintain manual skills.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then she talks about letting the human operator take over control regularly, i.e., do the job instead of the machine as a very effective training option. Actually, without doing hands-on work regularly, the skills of a human expert deteriorate surprisingly fast.</p>
<p>But if taking over the work regularly is not an option, e.g., because we want continuous superhuman productivity leveraging AI agents (no matter if it makes sense or not), we still need to make sure that the human operator can take over if needed. In such a setting, training must take place in some other way, usually using some kind of simulator.</p>
<p>However, there is a problem with simulators, especially if human intervention is only needed (and wanted) if things do not work as expected:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are problems with the use of any simulator to train for extreme situations. Unknown faults cannot be simulated, and system behaviour may not be known for faults which can be predicted but have not been experienced.</p></blockquote>
<p>The consequence of this issue is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This means that training must be concerned with general strategies rather than specific responses […]</p></blockquote>
<p>However:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is inadequate to expect the operator to react to unfamiliar events solely by consulting operating procedures. These cannot cover all the possibilities, so the operator is expected to monitor them and fill in the gaps.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which leaves us with the irony:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, it is ironic to train operators in following instructions and then put them in the system to provide intelligence.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a problem we will need to face with AI agents and their supervising humans in the future, too. The supervising experts are meant to intervene whenever things become messy, whenever the AI agents get stuck, often in unforeseen ways. These are not regular tasks. Often, these are also not the issues we expect an AI agent to run into and thus can provide training for. These are extraordinary situations, the ones we do not expect – and the more refined and specialized the AI agents will become in the future, the more often the issues that require human intervention will be of this kind.</p>
<p>The question is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>How can we train human operators at all to be able to intervene skillfully in exceptional, usually hard to solve situations?</li>
<li>How can we train a human operator so that their skills remain sharp over time and they remain able to address an exceptional situation quickly and resourcefully?</li>
</ol>
<p>The questions seem to hint at a sort of paradox, and an answer to both questions is all but obvious. At the moment, we still have enough experienced subject matter experts that the questions may feel of lower importance. But if we only start to address the questions when they become pressing, they will be even harder – if not impossible – to solve.</p>
<p>To end this consideration with the words of Lisanne Bainbridge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the final irony is that it is the most successful automated systems, with rare need for manual intervention, which may need the greatest investment in human operator training.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, we cannot simply take a few available human experts and make them supervise agents that took over their work without any further investments in the humans. Instead, we need to train them continuously, and the better the agents become, the more expensive the training of the supervisors will become. I highly doubt that decision makers who primarily think about saving money when it comes to AI agents are aware of this irony.</p>
<h2 id="interlude">Interlude</h2>
<p>As I wrote in the beginning of <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/ironies_of_ai_1/">first part of this blog series</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0005109883900468">“The ironies of automation”</a> is a very rich and dense paper. We are still only at the end of the second chapter “Approaches to solutions” which is two and a half pages into the paper and there is still a whole third chapter called “Human-computer collaboration” which takes up another page until we get to the conclusion.</p>
<p>While this third chapter also contains a lot of valuable advice that goes well beyond our focus here, I will leave it to you to read it on your own. As I indicated at the beginning, this paper is more than worth the time spent on it.</p>
<h2 id="the-leadership-dilemma">The leadership dilemma</h2>
<p>However, before finishing this little blog series, I would like to mention a new kind of dilemma that Lisanne Bainbridge did not discuss in her paper because the situation was a bit different with industrial production plant automation than with AI-agent-based automation. But as this topic fits nicely into the just-finished training paradox section, I decided to add it here.</p>
<p>The issue is that just monitoring an AI agent fleet doing its work and intervening if things go wrong usually is not sufficient, at least not yet. All the things discussed before apply, but there is more to interacting with AI agents because we cannot simply be reactive with AI agents. We cannot simply watch them doing their work and only intervene if things go wrong. Instead, we additionally need to be proactive with them: We need to <em>direct</em> them.</p>
<p>We need to tell the AI agents what to do, what not to do, which chunks to pick and so on. This is basically a <em>leadership role</em>. While you do not lead humans, the kind of work is quite similar: You are responsible for the result; you are allowed to set directions and constraints, but you do not immediately control the work. You only control it through communicating with the agents and trying to direct them in the right direction with orders, with feedback, with changed orders, with setting different constraints, etcetera.</p>
<p>This is a skill set most people do not have naturally. Usually, they need to develop it over time. Typically, before people are put in a leadership role directing humans, they will get a lot of leadership training teaching them the skills and tools needed to lead successfully. For most people, this is essential because if they come from the receiving end of orders (in the most general sense of “orders”), typically they are not used to setting direction and constraints. This tends to be a completely new skill they need to learn.</p>
<p>This does not apply only to leading humans but also to leading AI agents. While AI agents are not humans, and thus leadership will be different in detail, the basic skills and tools needed are the same. This is, BTW, one of the reasons why the people who praise agentic AI on LinkedIn and the like are very often managers who lead (human) teams. For them, leading an AI agent fleet feels very natural because it is very close to the work they do every day. However, for the people currently doing the work, leading an AI agent fleet usually does not feel natural at all.</p>
<p>However, I have not yet seen anyone receiving any kind of leadership training before being left alone with a fleet of AI agents, and I still see little discussion about the issue. “If it does not work properly, you need better prompts” is the usual response if someone struggles with directing agents successfully.</p>
<p>Sorry, but it is not that easy. The issue is much bigger than just optimizing a few prompts. The issue is that people have to change their approach completely to get any piece of work done. Instead of doing it directly, they need to learn how to get it done indirectly. They need to learn how to direct a group of AI agents effectively, how to <em>lead</em> them.</p>
<p>This also adds to the training irony of the previous topic. Maybe the AI agent fleets will become good enough in the future that we can omit the proactive part of the work and only need to focus on the reactive part of the work, the monitor-and-intervene part. But until then, we need to teach human supervisors of AI agent fleets how to lead them effectively.</p>
<h2 id="moving-on">Moving on</h2>
<p>We discussed several ironies and paradoxes from Lisanne Bainbridge’s “The ironies of automation” and how they also apply to agentic AI. We looked at the unlearning and recall dilemma and what it means for the next generation of human supervisors. We discussed monitoring fatigue and the status issue. We looked at the UX and UI deficiencies of current AI agents and the training paradox. And we finally looked at the leadership dilemma, which Lisanne Bainbridge did not discuss in her paper but which complements the training paradox.</p>
<p>I would like to conclude with the conclusion of Lisanne Bainbridge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] humans working without time-pressure can be impressive problem solvers. The difficulty remains that they are less effective when under time pressure. I hope this paper has made clear both the irony that one is not by automating necessarily removing the difficulties, and also the possibility that resolving them will require even greater technological ingenuity than does classic automation.</p></blockquote>
<p>I could not agree more.</p>
<p>I think over time we will become clear on how much “The ironies of automation” also applies to automation done with AI agents and that we cannot ignore the insights known for more than 40 years meanwhile. I am also really curious how the solutions to the ironies and paradoxes will look like.</p>
<p>Until then, I hope I gave you a bit of food for thought to ponder. If you should have some good ideas regarding the ironies and how to address them, please do not hesitate to share them with the community. We learn best by sharing and discussing, and maybe your contribution will be a step towards solving the issues discussed …</p>

<p>In 1950, while discussing the recent wave of flying saucer reports over lunch with colleagues at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, physicist Enrico Fermi asked a simple question.</p>



<p>There are hundreds of billions of stars in our Milky Way galaxy, and – presumed at the time – a significant percentage have Earth-like habitable planets orbiting them. The galaxy is billions of years old, and the odds are high that there should be other technological civilisations out there. But we see no convincing sign of them.</p>



<p>So, where is everybody?</p>



<p>This question is now know as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi Paradox</a>.</p>



<p>In the last couple of years, I’ve been seeing another paradox. Many people claim that working software can now be produced for pennies on the pound, in a fraction of the time that it takes humans. Some go so far as to claim that we’re in the age of commoditised software, throwaway software, and hail the end of the software industry as we know it.</p>



<p>Why buy a CRM solution or a ERM system when “AI” can generate one for you in hours or even minutes? Why sign up for a SaaS platform when Cursor can spit one out just as good in the blink of an eye?</p>



<p>But when we look beyond the noise – beyond these sensational flying saucer reports – we see nothing of the sort. No AI-generated Spotify or Salesforce or SAP. No LLM-generated games bothering the charts. No <a href="https://mikelovesrobots.substack.com/p/wheres-the-shovelware-why-ai-coding">noticeable uptick in new products</a> being added to the app stores.</p>



<p>So, <em>where is everybody</em>?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><p>On November 25th, 2025, we were on a routine Slack huddle debugging a production issue when we noticed something strange: a PR in one of our internal repos was suddenly closed, showed zero changes, and had a single commit from... Linus Torvalds?</p>
<p>The commit message was just "init."</p>
<p>Within seconds, our #git Slack channel exploded with notifications. Dozens of force-pushes. PRs closing across multiple repositories. All attributed to one of our engineers.</p>
<img src="https://trigger.dev/blog/shai-hulud-postmortem/screenshots/nicks-alert.png" alt="Nick's initial alert">
<p>We had been compromised by <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/shai-hulud-strikes-again-v2">Shai-Hulud 2.0</a>, a sophisticated npm supply chain worm that compromised over 500 packages, affected 25,000+ repositories, and spread across the JavaScript ecosystem. We weren't alone: <a href="https://posthog.com/blog/nov-24-shai-hulud-attack-post-mortem">PostHog</a>, Zapier, AsyncAPI, Postman, and ENS were among those hit.</p>
<p>This is the complete story of what happened, how we responded, and what we've changed to prevent this from happening again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No Trigger.dev packages were ever compromised. The <code>@trigger.dev/*</code> packages and <code>trigger.dev</code> CLI were never infected with Shai-Hulud malware. This incident involved one of our engineers installing a compromised package on their development machine, which led to credential theft and unauthorized access to our GitHub organization. Our published packages remained safe throughout.</p>

<h2 id="the-compromise">The compromise</h2>
<p>On the evening of November 24th, around 20:27 UTC (9:27 PM local time in Germany), one of our engineers was experimenting with a new project. They ran a command that triggered <code>pnpm install</code>. At that moment, somewhere in the dependency tree, a malicious package executed.</p>
<p>We don't know exactly which package delivered the payload. The engineer was experimenting at the time and may have deleted the project directory as part of cleanup. By the time we investigated, we couldn't trace back to the specific package. The engineer checked their shell history and they'd only run install commands in our main trigger repo, cloud repo, and one experimental project.</p>
<p>This is one of the frustrating realities of these attacks: once the malware runs, identifying the source becomes extremely difficult. The package doesn't announce itself. The <code>pnpm install</code> completes successfully. Everything looks normal.</p>
<p>What we do know is that the Shai-Hulud malware ran a <code>preinstall</code> script that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Downloaded and executed <a href="https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog">TruffleHog</a>, a legitimate security tool repurposed for credential theft</li>
<li>Scanned the engineer's machine for secrets: GitHub tokens, AWS credentials, npm tokens, environment variables</li>
<li>Exfiltrated everything it found</li>
</ol>
<p>When the engineer later recovered files from their compromised laptop (booted in recovery mode), they found the telltale signs:</p>
<img src="https://trigger.dev/blog/shai-hulud-postmortem/screenshots/trufflehog.jpg" alt="TruffleHog artifacts found on compromised machine">
<p>The <code>.trufflehog-cache</code> directory and <code>trufflehog_3.91.1_darwin_amd64.tar.gz</code> file found on the compromised machine. The <code>extract</code> directory was empty, likely cleaned up by the malware to cover its tracks.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="17-hours-of-reconnaissance">17 hours of reconnaissance</h2>
<p>The attacker had access to our engineer's GitHub account for 17 hours before doing anything visible. According to our GitHub audit logs, they operated methodically.</p>
<p>Just over two hours after the initial compromise, the attacker validated their stolen credentials and began mass cloning:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Time (UTC)</th><th>Location</th><th>Activity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>22:36:50</td><td>US</td><td>First attacker access, mass cloning begins</td></tr><tr><td>22:36-22:39</td><td>US</td><td>73 repositories cloned</td></tr><tr><td>22:48-22:50</td><td>US</td><td>~70 more repositories cloned (second wave)</td></tr><tr><td>22:55-22:56</td><td>US</td><td>~90 repositories cloned (third wave)</td></tr><tr><td>22:59-23:04</td><td>US</td><td>~70 repositories cloned (fourth wave)</td></tr><tr><td>23:32:59</td><td>India</td><td>Attacker switches to India-based infrastructure</td></tr><tr><td>23:32-23:37</td><td>India</td><td>73 repositories cloned</td></tr><tr><td>23:34-23:35</td><td>US + India</td><td>Simultaneous cloning from both locations</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>The simultaneous activity from US and India confirmed we were dealing with a single attacker using multiple VPNs or servers, not separate actors.</p>
<p>While our engineer slept in Germany, the attacker continued their reconnaissance. More cloning at 02:56-02:59 UTC (middle of the night in Germany), sporadic activity until 05:32 UTC. Total repos cloned: 669 (527 from US infrastructure, 142 from India).</p>
<p>Here's where it gets unsettling. Our engineer woke up and started their normal workday:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Time (UTC)</th><th>Actor</th><th>Activity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>09:08:27</td><td>Engineer</td><td>Triggers workflow on cloud repo (from Germany)</td></tr><tr><td>09:10-09:17</td><td>Attacker</td><td>Git fetches from US, watching the engineer</td></tr><tr><td>09:08-15:08</td><td>Engineer</td><td>Normal PR reviews, CI workflows (from Germany)</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>The attacker was monitoring our engineer's activity while they worked, unaware they were compromised.</p>
<p>During this period, the attacker created repositories with random string names to store stolen credentials, a known Shai-Hulud pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>github.com/[username]/xfjqb74uysxcni5ztn</code></li>
<li><code>github.com/[username]/ls4uzkvwnt0qckjq27</code></li>
<li><code>github.com/[username]/uxa7vo9og0rzts362c</code></li>
</ul>
<p>They also created three repos marked with "Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming" as a calling card. These repositories were empty by the time we examined them, but based on the documented Shai-Hulud behavior, they likely contained triple base64-encoded credentials.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="10-minutes-of-destruction">10 minutes of destruction</h2>
<p>At 15:27 UTC on November 25th, the attacker switched from reconnaissance to destruction.</p>
<p>The attack began on our <code>cloud</code> repo from India-based infrastructure:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Time (UTC)</th><th>Event</th><th>Repo</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>15:27:35</td><td>First force-push</td><td>triggerdotdev/cloud</td><td>Attack begins</td></tr><tr><td>15:27:37</td><td>PR closed</td><td>triggerdotdev/cloud</td><td>PR #300 closed</td></tr><tr><td>15:27:44</td><td>BLOCKED</td><td>triggerdotdev/cloud</td><td>Branch protection rejected force-push</td></tr><tr><td>15:27:50</td><td>PR closed</td><td>triggerdotdev/trigger.dev</td><td>PR #2707 closed</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>The attack continued on our main repository:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Time (UTC)</th><th>Event</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>15:28:13</td><td>PR closed</td><td>triggerdotdev/trigger.dev PR #2706 (release PR)</td></tr><tr><td>15:30:51</td><td>PR closed</td><td>triggerdotdev/trigger.dev PR #2451</td></tr><tr><td>15:31:10</td><td>PR closed</td><td>triggerdotdev/trigger.dev PR #2382</td></tr><tr><td>15:31:16</td><td>BLOCKED</td><td>Branch protection rejected force-push to trigger.dev</td></tr><tr><td>15:31:31</td><td>PR closed</td><td>triggerdotdev/trigger.dev PR #2482</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>At 15:32:43-46 UTC, 12 PRs on jsonhero-web were closed in 3 seconds. Clearly automated. PRs #47, #169, #176, #181, #189, #190, #194, #197, #204, #206, #208 all closed within a 3-second window.</p>
<p>Our critical infrastructure repository was targeted next:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Time (UTC)</th><th>Event</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>15:35:41</td><td>PR closed</td><td>triggerdotdev/infra PR #233</td></tr><tr><td>15:35:45</td><td>BLOCKED</td><td>Branch protection rejected force-push (India)</td></tr><tr><td>15:35:48</td><td>PR closed</td><td>triggerdotdev/infra PR #309</td></tr><tr><td>15:35:49</td><td>BLOCKED</td><td>Branch protection rejected force-push (India)</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>The final PR was closed on json-infer-types at 15:37:13 UTC.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="detection-and-response">Detection and response</h2>
<p>We got a lucky break. One of our team members was monitoring Slack when the flood of notifications started:</p>
<img src="https://trigger.dev/blog/shai-hulud-postmortem/screenshots/slack-notifications.png" alt="Slack notifications showing the attack">
<p>Our #git Slack channel during the attack. A wall of force-pushes, all with commit message "init."</p>
<p>Every malicious commit was authored as:</p>

<img src="https://trigger.dev/blog/shai-hulud-postmortem/screenshots/attacked-branch.png" alt="What an attacked branch looked like">
<p>An attacked branch: a single "init" commit attributed to Linus Torvalds, thousands of commits behind main.</p>
<p>We haven't found reports of other Shai-Hulud victims seeing this same "Linus Torvalds" vandalism pattern. The worm's documented behavior focuses on credential exfiltration and npm package propagation, not repository destruction. This destructive phase may have been unique to our attacker, or perhaps a manual follow-up action after the automated worm had done its credential harvesting.</p>
<p>Within 4 minutes of detection we identified the compromised account, removed them from the GitHub organization, and the attack stopped immediately.</p>
<p>Our internal Slack during those first minutes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Urmmm guys? what's going on?"</p>
<p>"add me to the call @here"</p>
<p>"Nick could you double check Infisical for any machine identities"</p>
<p>"can someone also check whether there are any reports of compromised packages in our CLI deps?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within the hour:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Time (UTC)</th><th>Action</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>~15:36</td><td>Removed from GitHub organization</td></tr><tr><td>~15:40</td><td>Removed from Infisical (secrets manager)</td></tr><tr><td>~15:45</td><td>Removed from AWS IAM Identity Center</td></tr><tr><td>~16:00</td><td>Removed from Vercel and Cloudflare</td></tr><tr><td>16:35</td><td>AWS SSO sessions blocked via deny policy (sessions can't be revoked)</td></tr><tr><td>16:45</td><td>IAM user console login deleted</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-damage">The damage</h2>
<p>Repository clone actions: 669 (public and private), including infrastructure code, internal documentation, and engineering plans.</p>
<p>Branches force-pushed: 199 across 16 repositories</p>
<p>Pull requests closed: 42</p>
<p>Protected branch rejections: 4. Some of our repositories have main branch protection enabled, but we had not enabled it for all repositories at the time of the incident.</p>
<p>npm packages were <strong>not</strong> compromised. This is the difference between "our repos got vandalized" and "our packages got compromised."</p>
<p>Our engineer didn't have an npm publishing token on their machine, and even if they did we had already required 2FA for publishing to npm. Without that, Shai-Hulud would have published malicious versions of <code>@trigger.dev/sdk</code>, <code>@trigger.dev/core</code>, and others, potentially affecting thousands of downstream users.</p>
<p>Production databases or any AWS resources were <strong>not</strong> accessed. Our AWS CloudTrail audit showed only read operations from the compromised account:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Event Type</th><th>Count</th><th>Service</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ListManagedNotificationEvents</td><td>~40</td><td>notifications</td></tr><tr><td>DescribeClusters</td><td>8</td><td>ECS</td></tr><tr><td>DescribeTasks</td><td>4</td><td>ECS</td></tr><tr><td>DescribeMetricFilters</td><td>6</td><td>CloudWatch</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>These were confirmed to be legitimate operations by our engineer.</p>
<p>One nice surprise: AWS actually sent us a proactive alert about Shai-Hulud. They detected the malware's characteristic behavior (ListSecrets, GetSecretValue, BatchGetSecretValue API calls) on an old test account that hadn't been used in months, so we just deleted it. But kudos to AWS for the proactive detection and notification.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-recovery">The recovery</h2>
<p>GitHub doesn't have server-side reflog. When someone force-pushes, that history is gone from GitHub's servers.</p>
<p>But we found ways to recover.</p>
<p>Push events are retained for 90 days via the GitHub Events API. We wrote a script that fetched pre-attack commit SHAs:</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span># Find pre-attack commit SHA from events</span></p></div><div><p><span>gh api repos/$REPO/events --paginate | \</span></p></div><div><p><span>  jq -r '.[] | select(.type=="PushEvent") |</span></p></div><div><p><span>  select(.payload.ref=="refs/heads/'$BRANCH'") |</span></p></div><div><p><span>  .payload.before' | head -1</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Public repository forks still contained original commits. We used these to verify and restore branches.</p>
<p>Developers who hadn't run <code>git fetch --prune</code> (all of us?) still had old SHAs in their local reflog.</p>
<p>Within 7 hours, all 199 branches were restored.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="github-app-private-key-exposure">GitHub app private key exposure</h2>
<p>During the investigation, our engineer was going through files recovered from the compromised laptop and discovered something concerning: the private key for our GitHub App was in the trash folder.</p>
<p>When you create a private key in the GitHub App settings, GitHub automatically downloads it. The engineer had created a key at some point, and while the active file had been deleted, it was still in the trash, potentially accessible to TruffleHog.</p>
<p>Our GitHub App has the following permissions on customer repositories:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Permission</th><th>Access Level</th><th>Risk</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>contents</td><td>read/write</td><td>Could read/write repository contents</td></tr><tr><td>pull_requests</td><td>read/write</td><td>Could read/create/modify PRs</td></tr><tr><td>deployments</td><td>read/write</td><td>Could create/trigger deployments</td></tr><tr><td>checks</td><td>read/write</td><td>Could create/modify check runs</td></tr><tr><td>commit_statuses</td><td>read/write</td><td>Could mark commits as passing/failing</td></tr><tr><td>metadata</td><td>read</td><td>Could read repository metadata</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>To generate valid access tokens, an attacker would need both the private key (potentially compromised) and the installation ID for a specific customer (stored in our database which was not compromised, not on the compromised machine).</p>
<p>We immediately rotated the key:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Time (UTC)</th><th>Action</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Nov 26, 18:51</td><td>Private key discovered in trash folder</td></tr><tr><td>Nov 26, 19:54</td><td>New key deployed to test environment</td></tr><tr><td>Nov 26, 20:16</td><td>New key deployed to production</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>We found no evidence of unauthorized access to any customer repositories. The attacker would have needed installation IDs from our database to generate tokens, and our database was not compromised as previously mentioned.</p>
<p>However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility. An attacker with the private key could theoretically have called the GitHub API to enumerate all installations. We've contacted GitHub Support to request additional access logs. We've also analyzed the webhook payloads to our GitHub app, looking for suspicious push or PR activity from connected installations &amp; repositories. We haven't found any evidence of unauthorized activity in these webhook payloads.</p>
<p>We've sent out an email to potentially effected customers to notify them of the incident with detailed instructions on how to check if they were affected. Please check your email for more details if you've used our GitHub app.</p>

<h2 id="technical-deep-dive-how-shai-hulud-works">Technical deep-dive: how Shai-Hulud works</h2>
<p>For those interested in the technical details, here's what we learned about the malware from <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/shai-hulud-strikes-again-v2">Socket's analysis</a> and our own investigation.</p>
<p>When npm runs the <code>preinstall</code> script, it executes <code>setup_bun.js</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Detects OS/architecture</li>
<li>Downloads or locates the <a href="https://bun.sh/">Bun</a> runtime</li>
<li>Caches Bun in <code>~/.cache</code></li>
<li>Spawns a detached Bun process running <code>bun_environment.js</code> with output suppressed</li>
<li>Returns immediately so <code>npm install</code> completes successfully with no warnings</li>
</ol>
<p>The malware runs in the background while you think everything is fine.</p>
<p>The payload uses TruffleHog to scan <code>$HOME</code> for GitHub tokens (from env vars, gh CLI config, git credential helpers), AWS/GCP/Azure credentials, npm tokens from <code>.npmrc</code>, environment variables containing anything that looks like a secret, and GitHub Actions secrets (if running in CI).</p>
<p>Stolen credentials are uploaded to a newly-created GitHub repo with a random name. The data is triple base64-encoded to evade GitHub's secret scanning.</p>
<p>Files created:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>contents.json</code> (system info and GitHub credentials)</li>
<li><code>environment.json</code> (all environment variables)</li>
<li><code>cloud.json</code> (cloud provider credentials)</li>
<li><code>truffleSecrets.json</code> (filesystem secrets from TruffleHog)</li>
<li><code>actionsSecrets.json</code> (GitHub Actions secrets if any)</li>
</ul>
<p>If an npm publishing token is found, the malware validates the token against the npm registry, fetches packages maintained by that account, downloads each package, patches it with the malware, bumps the version, and re-publishes, infecting more packages.</p>
<p>This is how the worm spread through the npm ecosystem, starting from <a href="https://posthog.com/blog/nov-24-shai-hulud-attack-post-mortem">PostHog's compromised CI</a> on November 24th at 4:11 AM UTC. Our engineer was infected roughly 16 hours after the malicious packages went live.</p>
<p>If no credentials are found to exfiltrate or propagate, the malware attempts to delete the victim's entire home directory. Scorched earth.</p>
<p>File artifacts to look for: <code>setup_bun.js</code>, <code>bun_environment.js</code>, <code>cloud.json</code>, <code>contents.json</code>, <code>environment.json</code>, <code>truffleSecrets.json</code>, <code>actionsSecrets.json</code>, <code>.trufflehog-cache/</code> directory.</p>
<p>Malware file hashes (SHA1):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bun_environment.js</code>: <code>d60ec97eea19fffb4809bc35b91033b52490ca11</code></li>
<li><code>bun_environment.js</code>: <code>3d7570d14d34b0ba137d502f042b27b0f37a59fa</code></li>
<li><code>setup_bun.js</code>: <code>d1829b4708126dcc7bea7437c04d1f10eacd4a16</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We've published a <a href="https://gist.github.com/ericallam/e2ae497d99a21d500fd9fbb01e1bfa02">detection script</a> that checks for Shai-Hulud indicators.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-weve-changed">What we've changed</h2>
<p>We disabled npm scripts globally:</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>npm config set ignore-scripts true --location=global</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>This prevents <code>preinstall</code>, <code>postinstall</code>, and other lifecycle scripts from running. It's aggressive and some packages will break, but it's the only reliable protection against this class of attack.</p>
<p>We upgraded to pnpm 10. This was significant effort (had to migrate through pnpm 9 first), but pnpm 10 brings critical security improvements. Scripts are ignored by default. You can explicitly whitelist packages that need to run scripts via <code>pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies</code>. And the <code>minimumReleaseAge</code> setting prevents installing packages published recently.</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span># pnpm-workspace.yaml</span></p></div><div><p><span>minimumReleaseAge: 4320 # 3 days in minutes</span></p></div><div><p><span>preferOffline: true</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>To whitelist packages that legitimately need build scripts:</p>

<p>This prompts you to select which packages to allow (like <code>esbuild</code>, <code>prisma</code>, <code>sharp</code>).</p>
<p>For your global pnpm config:</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>pnpm config set minimumReleaseAge 4320</span></p></div><div><p><span>pnpm config set --json minimumReleaseAgeExclude '["@trigger.dev/*", "trigger.dev"]'</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>We switched npm publishing to OIDC. No more long-lived npm tokens anywhere. Publishing now uses <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers">npm's trusted publishers</a> with GitHub Actions OIDC. Even if an attacker compromises a developer machine, they can't publish packages because there are no credentials to steal. Publishing only happens through CI with short-lived, scoped tokens.</p>
<p>We enabled branch protection on all repositories. Not just critical repos or just OSS repos. Every repository with meaningful code now has branch protection enabled.</p>
<p>We've adopted <a href="https://docs.commonfate.io/granted/introduction">Granted</a> for AWS SSO. Granted encrypts SSO session tokens on the client side, unlike the AWS CLI which stores them in plaintext.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://posthog.com/blog/nov-24-shai-hulud-attack-post-mortem">PostHog's analysis</a> of how they were initially compromised (via <code>pull_request_target</code>), we've reviewed our GitHub Actions workflows. We now require approval for external contributor workflow runs on all our repositories (previous policy was only for public repositories).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="lessons-for-other-teams">Lessons for other teams</h2>
<p>The ability for packages to run arbitrary code during installation is the attack surface. Until npm fundamentally changes, add this to your <code>~/.npmrc</code>:</p>

<p>Yes, some things will break. Whitelist them explicitly. The inconvenience is worth it.</p>
<p>pnpm 10 ignores scripts by default and lets you set a minimum age for packages:</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>pnpm config set minimumReleaseAge 4320  # 3 days</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Newly published packages can't be installed for 3 days, giving time for malicious packages to be detected.</p>
<p>Branch protection takes 30 seconds to enable. It prevents attackers from pushing to a main branch, potentially executing malicious GitHub action workflows.</p>
<p>Long-lived npm tokens on developer machines are a liability. Use <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers">trusted publishers</a> with OIDC instead.</p>
<p>If you don't need a credential on your local machine, don't have it there. Publishing should happen through CI only.</p>
<p>Our #git Slack channel is noisy. That noise saved us.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-note-on-the-human-side">A note on the human side</h2>
<p>One of the hardest parts of this incident was that it happened to a person.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sorry for all the trouble guys, terrible experience"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our compromised engineer felt terrible, even though they did absolutely nothing wrong. It could have happened to any team member.</p>
<p>Running <code>npm install</code> is not negligence. Installing dependencies is not a security failure. The security failure is in an ecosystem that allows packages to run arbitrary code silently.</p>
<p>They also discovered that the attacker had made their GitHub account star hundreds of random repositories during the compromise. Someone even emailed us: "hey you starred my repo but I think it was because you were hacked, maybe remove the star?"</p>

I already have a flight to see her in four days and I’m not sure it’s worth moving. This isn’t the first time she’s been in the ICU; for years she’s been in and out of hospitals and stuff that used to make us panic now makes us go ‘oh darn, again?’</p><p>I ask, How serious is it? The answers are fuzzy, and I am frustrated. I ask my dad to ask the doctor if she thinks family should come. I get the message: “Doc says yes come immediately.”</p><p>Five hours later, my sister and I are landing in Boise. We stop by my parents’ house to grab my mom’s car; I collect photos, a blanket I made her, a little stuffed otter. My mom loves otters. I haven’t thought too hard about her dying, I don’t know if she’s going to die, but everything we’re doing feels important in a way I haven’t felt before. We’re shaky.</p><p>We park in the freezing Idaho hospital parking lot at 1 am; my sister says it feels like we’re walking through a fiery gate into doom. She’s right, we’re bracing. The edges of reality begin to pulse.</p><p>The front desk gives us wristbands, and we begin the long winding walk to the ICU. At the end of the big hall stands my dad and an old family friend I haven’t seen in years. She hugs us and says “I’m gonna warn you, it’s shocking.” She says, “I’m so sorry, girls.”</p><p>We get into the ICU, they make us wash our hands. A nurse preps us, says our mom can hear us but will be unresponsive. Our mom might move, but this is instinctual and not conscious.</p><p>We go in. My mom is barely recognizeable, shriveled down like her soul is half gone and her flesh is deflating around the space it’s leaving behind. She’s got a tube in her throat and out her arms and neck, wires all over her head. She’s handcuffed to the bed so she doesn’t tear out the ventilator.</p><p>My sister and I hold her hands and cry. We speak to her, but there’s no movement, not even twitching. We sob ‘i love you’ over and over. </p><p>My dad’s been sleeping in the hospital. We tell him he should go home, he’s barely slept in days, we’ll keep watch over her. He leaves, but we can’t sleep; we sit by her side for hours, staring at her, talking to her. I read her sweet messages sent by people who love her. </p><p>I put the blanket I made on her. I’d given it to her last time I visited, two weeks ago. She squealed like a delighted child, but her brain wasn’t working, and she quickly forgot. Any time she seemed distressed, I’d just give her the blanket again - “Look mom, I crocheted this for you” - and she’d drop everything and squeal again, and clutch it to her chest. I got to give it to her probably five times. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png" width="346" height="368.5861111111111" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:767,&quot;width&quot;:720,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:346,&quot;bytes&quot;:1038465,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://aella.substack.com/i/179892510?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!o3SE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8544b003-13bb-489f-918b-ca5950b14a41_720x767.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>We sleep in the room with her, a few hours here and there. I keep waking up with adrenaline every time her monitor beeps, but no changes. Doctors come in and brush her teeth and rotate her body a little. </p><p><span>I remember hearing other people say the phrase “Nobody knew what to do” during crises, but I’d always assumed it was a paralysis around what to do with important decisions like ‘do we keep them alive’ or ‘what do we do with the body’. But here, in the middle of it, I realize it applies to </span><em>everything</em><span>. I can’t think at all. The part of our brain that does evaluation, desire, and choice has been completely overrun; when someone asks “I’m gonna grab sushi, do you want any” we stare at them in confusion. I keep saying ‘sure, I guess’ at food offers, and the little room accumulates </span><em>way</em><span> too much food that slowly goes bad over days. It’s hard to know when to sleep, or when to trade shifts - we should probably take shifts, right? Nobody has a sleep schedule, we’re running on a few hours each night. All I can remember is that when I got there, I thought at least one of us should be well rested at any given time. It’s hard to track that now. We’re disorganized, our half-unpacked suitcases spill everywhere. The air is different. We keep the blinds to the window closed because my dad has autism, and so we can’t see the sun passing; the only sense of time passing is the pulses of nurse activity outside the door and their shift changes. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg" width="516" height="305.187648456057" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:747,&quot;width&quot;:1263,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:516,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9ay5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6579eb13-9ec4-44cc-8002-d2df885ab465_1263x747.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>We’ve fallen into a crack in reality, a place where the veil is thin and the water is still, while the world continues to eddy around us through the hallways outside.</p><p><span>The doctors come in and give us updates, frustratingly vague. She has acute liver shock, with an AST over 2200. Her brain isn’t working but it doesn’t seem like the liver shock was the cause (low amonia). They don’t know exactly what’s going on, could be a seizure but no observed seizure activity. They don’t say anything about survival odds, even when I ask. I say “Okay, if you had a hundred people similar to her, in her condition, what percentage of them would you expect to survive” and they say “we don’t know, it’s so dependent on the person.” I say okay - “but probably not </span><em>99 </em><span>of them, and not only 1 of them. So if you know it’s </span><em>not</em><span> those numbers, what number sounds </span><em>more</em><span> right” and they say “Good point,” but still won’t give me any actual number. I want to scream. I say “do you think taking her off life support is the next step”, and one of them, I think the head doctor, says “If this were my family member, yes, I would prepare to let her pass.” I accept it. I sort of already knew. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7hgn!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2898f541-da9b-45d8-ac75-85270f9ffa46_1263x711.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7hgn!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2898f541-da9b-45d8-ac75-85270f9ffa46_1263x711.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7hgn!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2898f541-da9b-45d8-ac75-85270f9ffa46_1263x711.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7hgn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2898f541-da9b-45d8-ac75-85270f9ffa46_1263x711.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7hgn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2898f541-da9b-45d8-ac75-85270f9ffa46_1263x711.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7hgn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2898f541-da9b-45d8-ac75-85270f9ffa46_1263x711.jpeg" width="446" height="251.07363420427552" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2898f541-da9b-45d8-ac75-85270f9ffa46_1263x711.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:711,&quot;width&quot;:1263,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:446,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7hgn!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2898f541-da9b-45d8-ac75-85270f9ffa46_1263x711.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7hgn!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2898f541-da9b-45d8-ac75-85270f9ffa46_1263x711.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7hgn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2898f541-da9b-45d8-ac75-85270f9ffa46_1263x711.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7hgn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2898f541-da9b-45d8-ac75-85270f9ffa46_1263x711.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>I am accidentally making decisions about her life. I say “I think maybe we should wait for my other sister to get here, and then we’ll take her off the next morning?” and nobody has any better idea, so I start telling other people the plan as though it’s real. </p><p><span>My other sister is overseas, and it’s going to take two days for her to get here. I grow impatient. I am afraid that if my sister takes too long to get here, my mom might start improving, and ‘taking her off life support’ would no longer be an option. Her surviving is a horrifying option; her life has already been constant suffering before this, and the damage to her body now would mean if she did survive, her quality of life would somehow be even </span><em>lower</em><span>. She’s only 66, but she’s been saying she’s ready to die for a long time. </span></p><p>But despite knowing she would not want to survive this, I watch myself pore over her medical records, trying to figure out if there’s anything we can do to keep her alive. I don’t know why I’m doing this. I am looking for an escape from her incoming death, even though I know I couldn’t take it if I found it. It keeps distracting me, I keep impulsively lurching towards it and having to stop myself.</p><p>I find I am possessed by gentleness, my movements are heavy with care. I touch her hands delicately, I brush her hair, I kiss her forehead, I tuck the blankets around her just right. I am shocked at how powerful this urge is, it doesn’t feel like a choice. I’ve been hollowed out by love. My care for her seems like clearly the realest thing. All other things in my life I thought I cared about turn into faint shadows in the face of this. It feels like I’m made out of a billion tiny particles that are all pointing in the same direction. It’s here that I am full. Despite my lack of sleep and my grief, I am a white hot light. I have never been so glad to suffer.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wnSm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7d77dfc-4ede-4488-9d2b-545b3d15ca2c_471x839.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wnSm!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7d77dfc-4ede-4488-9d2b-545b3d15ca2c_471x839.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wnSm!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7d77dfc-4ede-4488-9d2b-545b3d15ca2c_471x839.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wnSm!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7d77dfc-4ede-4488-9d2b-545b3d15ca2c_471x839.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wnSm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7d77dfc-4ede-4488-9d2b-545b3d15ca2c_471x839.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wnSm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7d77dfc-4ede-4488-9d2b-545b3d15ca2c_471x839.jpeg" width="293" height="521.9256900212314" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a7d77dfc-4ede-4488-9d2b-545b3d15ca2c_471x839.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:839,&quot;width&quot;:471,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:293,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wnSm!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7d77dfc-4ede-4488-9d2b-545b3d15ca2c_471x839.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wnSm!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7d77dfc-4ede-4488-9d2b-545b3d15ca2c_471x839.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wnSm!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7d77dfc-4ede-4488-9d2b-545b3d15ca2c_471x839.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wnSm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7d77dfc-4ede-4488-9d2b-545b3d15ca2c_471x839.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Sometimes her friends come in to see her. We stand around her unresponsive body and tell stories about her life. One time there was a hornet’s nest in the back yard, and she went out with a fire extinguisher, determined to kill them all. She held up the nozzle, aimed carefully, and sprayed - but the nozzle was turned backwards, and it went all into her face. We howl as my sister describes her coming back in the house, her hair frizzed out with the white powder. </p><p>I’d gotten an airbnb near the hospital, but I end up napping there only twice - once in the middle of the day, when the room was full of people, and again, the night before we kill her. My other sister had finally gotten in from overseas and we let her sleep in the room the final night.</p><p>As the scheduled time draws near, everything starts to feel different. Each passing minute is a greater percentage of the final minutes we have with her, getting compressed down, heating under the pressure. By the final morning, the contractions have started. We gather in the room for the last time. </p><p>We all leave the room to allow each one of us to say our goodbyes in privacy. When it’s my turn I go in and it’s her and I, alone. I’d already talked to her in the past blurry days, in the middle of the night when everyone was gone or sleeping in corners I sat by her bedside, holding her precious hand and whispering to her. But this is the last time. I tell her she was a wonderful mom. The walls are twisting in, squeezing the words out of me. I tell her I’m sad we ended up such different people, in a tragic, inevitable way that put distance between us. I tell her I’ll miss her. I tell her many other tender things that were for her ears alone. Each second is so loud; there’s so few of them left, and they are screaming. </p><p>Finally we’ve all said our words, and crowd back in. We hold her, we tell the doctors we’re ready. We are shaking. I don’t know what to do. We can’t do anything. They tell us they’re going to remove the ventilator, that we can step out if we want. We all say no. Leaving would be profane. I need to be with her through every second of this. I watch them gently unstrap things around her face, press buttons. They say after they take it out, she will probably die quickly. The ground is rumbling beneath us, the air is bearing down; I think my sister is going to pass out and I manage to pull her into a chair. They lay out a napkin below my mom’s chin. “One, two, three,” says a nurse, and they pull it out, the long tube that comes out with a wet noise. An immense, familiar agony is tearing through my body, starting in my lower gut and pulsing out through my arms and pouring out from my hands and the top of my head and the water from my eyes. The final descent shudders with holiness. The air itself is crying out with a chorus of our primal cries, we have no control over our bodies. She’s on her own now, and she is dying. My sister is sobbing “Momma, I love you”. We feel for her pulse, can’t tell if the beat we feel is our own hearts in our hands or if it’s hers. I put my fingers under her nose, feel the faintest air for a moment, and then I can’t feel any more. A moment later the doctors come in - they’d been watching her heart from the outside - and tell us she’s gone.</p><p><span>Almost immediately, a calmness washes over the Crack in Reality, and we sit back, and reality releases its contraction. I’m surprised by how fast the change is; I thought maybe </span><em>now</em><span> is when it would be the worst, but these seconds are so soft. We cry softly, and hold her body softly, and watch the blood start to pool on the underside of her arms and the bottom of her tongue. She looks like the renassaince paintings of dead bodies, and I wonder how many loved ones those old painters had watched die. My sister crawls into bed with her and wraps her arms around our mom’s body. I am hyper aware of the blood moving in my body, the pink under my own skin. </span></p><p>This is so weird. I talk to her, but it feels different now. We are in the aftershocks. Her body is a symbol; like her rings we saved, the little locks of her hair we cut, the photos we took of her; her body is like that, now, just heavier. </p><p>We spend three more hours in the room before we’re ready to leave the Crack in Reality. We collect our things, and the blanket, and the otter. Leaving her alone seems wrong; I put the stuffed animal in the crook of her arm, wrapping her arms around it, I say she can’t be alone, the otter needs to stay with her so that she’s not alone. This makes no sense; it doesn’t matter, I am sobbing, my love has nowhere to go and so it is leaking out, forcing any action it can through the cracks.</p><p><span>But then I leave, we all leave, dazed and raw, and time goes on. It just keeps going. It goes through her letters, old photos, the funeral, the gathering afterwards. It goes through moments of grief and moments of strange disassociative normality. It goes through dark jokes, and old bitter stories, and sentimental talismans. It goes back out of Idaho, maybe for the last time. It goes through memories slamming into me when I’m trying to sleep, and then through nights of good sleep, and new moments of forgetting. And now that crack in reality lies as a faint shadow over my shoulder. But I can </span><em>see</em><span> it still, like it’s a room in my house. Maybe one day I’ll end up back there.</span></p><p>My mom was the opposite of me in almost every way two humans can be opposite. She was traditional and uncomplicated; she once complained to me she didn’t like these new shows that portrayed the bad guy as sympathetic, that was a level of moral nuance she did not appreciate. She was so devoutly religious, most of you probably cannot actually imagine how much; she loved worshipping Jesus and putting crosses on everything she could. Years ago I asked “when you were little, what did you want to be when you grew up?” and she said “a mom.” She, as far as I know, had one sexual partner her entire life. </p><p>I think it’s then particularly remarkable that she still loved me - a famous atheist prostitute. Our relationship was hard because she didn’t want to hear about my life, and all my projects were in some way sex related - but that was the most it ever got in the way. She never tried to make me feel bad or pressure me. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png" width="316" height="182" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:182,&quot;width&quot;:316,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:9696,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://aella.substack.com/i/179892510?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dpfr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f7b896c-498b-4a8a-baa4-75174b9c4921_316x182.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>She was far from perfect, but for all her flaws she managed to channel an unconditional love made all the more beautiful by how hard it would be for most people like her to love most daughters like me.

She poured it all out into my earliest years, when I was still forming in the world. I will forever be shaped by it. It’s hard to look at the intensity of that love directly. It’s blinding.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.sanity.io/blog/you-should-never-build-a-cms">https://www.sanity.io/blog/you-should-never-build-a-cms</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46261020">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're just going to call it: up until recently, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cursor.com/" target="_blank">cursor.com</a> was powered by Sanity as its CMS.</p><p>Then Lee Robinson sat down and spent 344 agent requests and around $260 to migrate the content and setup to <!--$?--><template id="B:0"></template>markdown<!--/$--> files, GitHub, Vercel, and a vibe-coded media management interface.</p><p>He did <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://leerob.com/agents" target="_blank">a great write-up of the process on his blog</a>. He was classy and didn't name us.</p><p>Of course, when a high-profile customer moves off your product and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://x.com/leerob/status/1867513884382597485" target="_blank">the story resonates with builders you respect</a>, you pay attention.</p><p>The weird twist here is that we sort of agree with Lee’s take. He has a lot of great points. The conversation around complexity and abstractions that a <span>headless CMS</span> brings reflects real frustration. The way things have been done for the past decade deserved criticism.</p><p>But Lee's post doesn't tell the full story. We see what people are trying to solve when it comes to content every day. We live and breathe this CMS stuff. So let us add some context.</p><p>The headless CMS industry built complexity that didn't deliver proportional value for many. This is true.</p><p>Preview workflows are clunky. Draft modes, toolbar toggles, account requirements just to see what your content looks like before it goes live. Having to add data attributes everywhere to connect front ends with backend fields feels unnecessary.  Real friction for something that feels it should be simple.</p><p>Auth fragmentation is annoying. CMS login. GitHub login. Hosting provider login. Three systems to get a preview working.</p><p>Their CDN costs was largely caused by hosting a video from our file storage. It’s not an ideal way to host videos in front of Cursor’s massive audience. We should have made it more obvious that there are better and cheaper ways, like using the Mux plugin.</p><p>332K lines of code was removed in exchange for 43K new ones. That sounds a great win. We love getting rid of code too. </p><p>And here's the one that actually matters: AI agents couldn't easily reach content behind authenticated APIs. When your coding agent can grep your codebase but can't query your CMS, that's a real problem. Lee felt this friction and responded to it. (We did too, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mcp.sanity.io/" target="_blank">the new very capable MCP server is out</a>).</p><p>These complaints are valid. We're not going to pretend otherwise. </p><p>Here's the thing though. Read his post carefully and look at what he ended up with:</p><ul><li>An asset management GUI (built with "3-4 prompts," which, to be fair, is impressive)</li><li>User management via GitHub permissions</li><li><!--$?--><template id="B:1"></template>Version control<!--/$--> via git</li><li>Localization tooling</li><li>A <!--$?--><template id="B:2"></template>content model<!--/$--> (markdown frontmatter with specific fields)</li></ul><p>These are CMS features. Distributed across npm scripts, GitHub's permission system, and Vercel's infrastructure.</p><p>The features exist because the problems are real. You can delete the CMS, but you can't delete the need to manage assets, control who can publish what, track changes, and structure your content for reusability and distribution at scale.</p><p>Give it six months. The bespoke tooling will grow. The edge cases will multiply. Someone will need to schedule a post. Someone will need to preview on mobile. Someone will want to revert a change from three weeks ago and git reflog won't cut it. The "simple" system will accrete complexity because content management <em>is</em> complex.</p><p>Even with agents. Who were mostly trained within the constraints of these patterns.</p><p>Lee's model is clean: one markdown file equals one page. Simple. Grep-able.</p><p>This works until it doesn't.</p><h3 id="5xtauv"><a title="Copy link to heading" href="https://www.sanity.io/blog/you-should-never-build-a-cms#5xtauv">The content === page trap</a></h3><p>What happens when your pricing lives in three places? The pricing page, the comparison table, the footer CTA. In markdown-land, you update three files. Or you build a templating system that pulls from a canonical source. At which point you've invented content references. At which point you're building a CMS.</p><p>What happens when legal needs to update the compliance language that appears on 47 pages? You grep for the old string and replace it. Except the string has slight variations. Except someone reworded it slightly on the enterprise page. Except now you need to verify each change because regex can't understand intent. Now you are building a CMS.</p><p>What happens when you want to know "where is this product mentioned?" You can grep for the product name. You can't grep for "content that references this product entity" because markdown doesn't have entities. It has strings. </p><p>Suddenly you’re parsing thousands of files on every build to check for broken links (that you can’t query). And yes, you are building a CMS.</p><p>Structured content breaks the content = page assumption on purpose. A product is a document. A landing page document references that product and both are rendered together on the website. And in an app. And the support article for that product. When the product information changes, that changes is reflected in all these places. When you need to find every mention, you query the references, not the strings.</p><p>Engineers understand this. It's normalization. It's the same reason you don't store <code>customer_name</code> as a string in every order row. You store a <code>customer_id</code> and join.</p><p><strong>Markdown files are the content equivalent of denormalized strings everywhere. It works for small datasets. It becomes a maintenance nightmare at scale.</strong></p><h3 id="5xtavo"><a title="Copy link to heading" href="https://www.sanity.io/blog/you-should-never-build-a-cms#5xtavo">Git is not a content collaboration tool</a></h3><p>Git is a version control system built for code. Code has specific properties that make git work well:</p><ul><li>Merge conflicts are mechanical. Two people edited the same function. The resolution is structural.</li><li>Line-based diffing makes sense. Code is organized in lines that map to logical units.</li><li>Branching maps to features. You branch to build something, then merge when it's done.</li><li>Async is fine. You don't need to see someone else's changes until they push.</li></ul><p>Content has different properties:</p><ul><li>Merge conflicts are semantic. Two people edited the same paragraph with different intentions. The "correct" merge requires understanding what both people <em>meant</em>.</li><li>Line-based diffing is arbitrary. A paragraph rewrite shows as one changed line that actually changes everything. If you have block content (like Notion) this breaks apart even more.</li><li>Branching doesn't map to content workflows. "I'm working on the Q3 campaign" isn't a branch. It's 30 pieces of content across 12 pages with 4 people contributing.</li><li>Real-time matters. When your content team is distributed, "I'm editing this doc" needs to be visible <em>now</em>, not after a commit and push. Even more so with AI automation and agents in the mix.</li></ul><p>None of this is git's fault. Git solved the problem it was built for brilliantly. Content collaboration isn't that problem.</p><p>We know this because every team that scales content on git builds the same workarounds:</p><ul><li>Lock files or Slack conversations to prevent simultaneous editing</li><li>"I'm working on X, don't touch it" announcements</li><li>Elaborate PR review processes that become bottlenecks</li><li>Content freezes before launches because merge complexity is too high</li></ul><p>Sound familiar? These are the problems CMSes were built to solve. Real-time collaboration. Conflict-free editing. Workflow states that aren't git branches.</p><p>Lee's core argument: AI agents can now grep the codebase, so content should live in the codebase.</p><p>This sounds reasonable until you think about what grep actually does. It's string matching. Pattern finding. It's great for "find all files containing X."</p><p>It's not great for:</p><ul><li>"All blog posts mentioning feature Y published after September"</li><li>"Products with price &gt; $100 that are in stock"</li><li>"Content tagged 'enterprise' that hasn't been translated to German yet"</li><li>"The three most recent case studies in the finance category"</li></ul><p>Here's what that last one looks like in GROQ:</p><p>Try writing that as a grep command against markdown files. You can't. You'd need to parse frontmatter, understand your date format, resolve the category references, handle the sorting, limit the results. At which point you've built a query engine.</p><p>Structured content with a real <!--$?--><template id="B:4"></template>query language<!--/$--> is what agents actually need to reason about content. Markdown files are <em>less</em> queryable than a proper content API, not more.</p><p>The irony here is thick. Lee's argument for moving to code is that agents can work with code. But agents are better at working with structured data and APIs than they are at parsing arbitrary file formats and grepping for strings. That's not a limitation of current AI. That's just how information retrieval works.</p><p>Here's what we think Lee got backwards: the solution to "my agent can't access my CMS" isn't "delete the CMS." It's "give your agent access to the CMS."</p><p>It was also bad timing. Our MCP server wasn't good enough when Lee tried it.</p><p>But we fixed it. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mcp.sanity.io/" target="_blank">Our new MCP server is out now</a>.</p><p>Your coding agent can now create new content projects, query your content, create documents, update schemas, and manage releases. All through the same interface you're already using to build everything else. You never have to see any CMS UI unless you want to.</p><p>Schema, queryable content. From prompts. In about 10 minutes from start to deployed. You can ask it to generate images of those cars too.</p><figure data-type="muxVideo2"><p><img sizes="100vw" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://image.mux.com/fOG02RAwwy00Z4eqtBlOYIQGSvZ4GWUEKC/thumbnail.webp?time=0" srcset="https://image.mux.com/fOG02RAwwy00Z4eqtBlOYIQGSvZ4GWUEKC/thumbnail.webp?time=0&amp;width=200 200w, https://image.mux.com/fOG02RAwwy00Z4eqtBlOYIQGSvZ4GWUEKC/thumbnail.webp?time=0&amp;width=400 400w, https://image.mux.com/fOG02RAwwy00Z4eqtBlOYIQGSvZ4GWUEKC/thumbnail.webp?time=0&amp;width=600 600w, https://image.mux.com/fOG02RAwwy00Z4eqtBlOYIQGSvZ4GWUEKC/thumbnail.webp?time=0&amp;width=800 800w, https://image.mux.com/fOG02RAwwy00Z4eqtBlOYIQGSvZ4GWUEKC/thumbnail.webp?time=0&amp;width=1200 1200w, https://image.mux.com/fOG02RAwwy00Z4eqtBlOYIQGSvZ4GWUEKC/thumbnail.webp?time=0&amp;width=1600 1600w"></p></figure><p>You can also use it for content inquires like this:</p><p>The agent queries your actual schema and returns actionable results. Not string matches. Actual documents with their field states.</p><p>The agent checks your existing schema, generates compatible additions, and can deploy them. No tab-switching to documentation. No copy-pasting boilerplate.</p><p>This is what "agents working with content" actually looks like. Not grep. A query language. Not editing markdown. Operating on structured data through proper APIs. Not string matching. Semantic understanding of your content model.</p><p>Here’s something we should acknowledge: LLMs are good at markdown. They were trained on massive amounts of it. The format is token-efficient compared to JSON and XML. When you ask an agent to write or edit prose, markdown is a reasonable output format. </p><p>This is real. It’s part of why Lee’s migration worked.</p><p>But there is a difference between “good format for LLM I/O” and “good format for content infrastructure.”</p><p>LLMs are also good at SQL (they even now GROQ fairly well when you remind them). That doesn’t mean you should store your database as .sql files in git and have agents grep them. The query language and the storage layer are different concerns.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/02/thoughts-on-markdown/" target="_blank">I wrote about this three years ago in Smashing Magazine</a>, before LLMs changed everything. The arguments still hold: you can’t query markdown, structured content is more tinker-able, and hosting content in a database doesn’t mean you own it less. </p><p>What’s changed is that we now have agents that can work with both formats. The question is which architecture sets them up to do more.</p><p>Let's be fair about scope. Cursor’s setup works for cursor.com right now because:</p><ul><li>Their entire team writes code. "Designers are developers" at Cursor.</li><li>Content has one destination: the website.</li><li>They ship infrequently enough that git workflows are fine.</li><li>They don't need approval chains, compliance audits, or role-based permissions beyond what GitHub provides.</li><li>Localization is "AI at build time."</li></ul><p>If your company looks like this, maybe markdown in git is fine. Genuinely.</p><p>But most companies don't look like this.</p><p>This is what we are seeing every day:</p><ul><li>Content needs to flow to apps, email systems, AI agents, personalization engines. Not just one website.</li><li>You need structured data, not just prose. Product specs. Pricing tables. Configuration. Things that need to be queryable and validated.</li><li>You have governance requirements. "Who changed this and when" needs actual audit trails, not git blame.</li><li>You need real-time collaboration. Multiple people and agents working on the same content simultaneously. Git merge conflicts on prose are miserable for humans and wasteful for agents.</li><li><!--$?--><template id="B:7"></template>Content operations<!--/$--> need to scale independently of engineering. Not because your team can’t learn git, but because content velocity shouldn’t be bottlenecked by PR review cycles.</li></ul><p>Cursor is ~50 developers shipping one product website. That context matters.</p><p>The debate shouldn't be "CMS vs. no CMS."</p><p>There are definitely parts of the traditional CMS we should nuke into the sun with fire:</p><ul><li>WYSIWYG editors that produce garbage HTML soup</li><li>Page builders that store content as layout blobs (you can't query "all hero sections" if hero sections are just JSON fragments in a page blob)</li><li><!--$?--><template id="B:8"></template>Webhook<!--/$--> hell for basic content updates</li><li>"Content modeling" that's really just "pick from these 15 field types and good luck"</li><li>Revision history that tells you something changed but not what or why</li></ul><p>We can leave these things behind without resorting to git and markdown.</p><p>Rather, the question should be: <strong>is your content infrastructure built for AI to be both author and consumer?</strong></p><p>That means:</p><ul><li><strong>Structured, not flat files.</strong> AI that can reason about typed fields and relationships, not arbitrary strings.</li><li><strong>Queryable, not grep-able.</strong> Real query languages that understand your schema, not regex pattern matching.</li><li><strong>Real-time, not batch.</strong> Content changes shouldn't require a <!--$?--><template id="B:9"></template>deployment<!--/$--> to be visible.</li><li><strong>Presentation-agnostic.</strong> No hex colors in your content model. No assumptions about where content renders. Separation of concerns.</li></ul><p>Lee's frustration was valid: "I don't want to click through UIs just to update content."</p><p>The answer is content infrastructure that works the way modern development does. Agents that understand your schema. Queries that express intent. APIs that don't require you to build a query engine out of grep and find.</p><p>Lee's post went viral because it resonated. Developers have real frustrations with content management tools that were built for a different era.</p><p>We know. We literally built Sanity because we were angry at the CMS industry (a.k.a “spite-driven development”)</p><p>The answer isn't to retreat to 2002 and plain text files for agents to parse. It's to build what actually solves the problem: content infrastructure that AI can read, write, and reason about.</p><p>You shouldn't build a CMS from scratch with grep and markdown files. You probably shouldn't have to click through forms to update content either. Both of these can be true.</p><p>The tools exist to have it both ways. Structured content that agents can actually query. Editorial interfaces that don't require git. Real-time collaboration that doesn't involve merge conflicts on prose.</p><p>That's what we're building. Lee's post is a good reminder of what happens when we don't get it right.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>You’re Good</h2>

<p><em>“A few, for sure.”</em><br><em>“About four times, actually. And my family’s rather small.”</em><br><em>“Suicide has impacted my old friend group quite a bit.”</em><br><em>“I’ve lost friends.

</p><p>I’m interviewing fellow Indigenous metalheads at a heavy music festival on the Blackfeet Nation, with Russel Daniels (Diné and Ho-Chunk descent), a photographer who’s not into metal.



</p><div><p><em>“Plenty of times.”</em><br><em>“I had attempted two times.”</em><br><em>“Growing up here, you could feel very isolated.”</em><br><em>“The truth is I felt like I didn’t belong anywhere.”<br>“Everywhere I went I just didn’t feel like I had enough of me in me.”</em><br><em>“It’s a battle, for sure.

</p><h2><strong>Buffalo Hide Academy</strong></h2>

<p>The school year was almost past, and a hot May afternoon lorded over Browning, Montana, capital of the Blackfeet Nation. Grinning rez dogs with patchy coats rested in the sidewalk shade outside an alternative public high school called Buffalo Hide Academy, where lunch was ending. Students ambled into a warehouse-sized classroom with a podium and some tables at the far end, and musical instruments in a corner by the teacher’s office. Student artwork and a Blackfeet Nation flag bedecked the walls alongside a mural of a buffalo skull and the school’s name in dripping red letters. The kids didn’t sit in rows or take out homework; nobody checked whether they were on time. They shuffled around in grubby Converse, joking with each other at full volume. Some picked up instruments and started jamming with their teacher, Robert Hall (Piikunii), who was already messing around on the drum kit. It got loud, fast.



</p><p>“I would describe Browning as metal,” Hall told me, seated at the drums in a luau shirt and bushy black ponytail, his ferocious brown eyes the size of jawbreakers. “We don’t turn away from the darkness,” he said. “We don’t hide our own ugliness, the way that people in big cities could hide.” The town is rough, even by rez standards. “There’s buildings that have been standing just in a void. No humans, no life running through these buildings for years,” Hall explained. “But there’s immense beauty here, too — extreme beauty. Our murals, our family networks, our ancient history, our language, the things that are binding us together for thousands of generations.”

</p>



<p>Another teacher, Charlie Speicher, warmed up the mic. “Who likes chaotic mathcore?” he tried, referring to a rhythmically unpredictable subgenre of hardcore punk that he describes as “bonkers” and “all over the place.” Two hands went up. One was mine. “That makes three of us,” said Speicher as he pulled up a YouTube video.


</p>
<p>The students were finishing the inaugural year of Buffalo Hide Academy’s semester-long, two-hour heavy music symposium dedicated to the study of metal and hardcore. Speicher, who’s non-Native, is a clinical counselor and also Buffalo Hide Academy’s director. The symposium was his brainchild. He and other teachers hand-picked students who looked like they might be isolated, or might be into darker, more aggressive art and music — kids who might be potential metalheads. More than fifty students initially enrolled. By the end of the first semester, kids were sneaking out of other classes to join.



</p><p>Speicher teaches in his “battle vest,” a staple of metal fashion that’s usually denim hand-studded with metal pyramids or spikes, and stitched with patches showing band logos in barbed, rootlike scripts impossible for the uninitiated to decipher. In addition to providing a feeling of physical protection, battle vests are threshold guardians that intimidate normies while signalling to dedicated fans who recognize the glyphs. If you know, you know — and you’re family. If not, fuck off. But Speicher is here to welcome kids into the fold, where a community of music fans understands their suffering. Or, as he put it later, “to create more safety and protection specifically from suicidal distress,” which he said has impacted every family in Browning.



</p><p>Some in Browning think he’s doing the devil’s work, but Speicher is as warm and approachable as a cool youth pastor, speaking gently and smiling easily through a handsome swath of stubble. His vest is emblazoned with the gaunt face from Converge’s 2001 album <em>Jane Doe.</em> He showed the kids the music video to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY-JkeXK4dU">Farewell, Mona Lisa</a>” by mathcore band The Dillinger Escape Plan. It sometimes sounds like Dick Van Dyke’s fancy footwork flawlessly executing a trip and stumble. “Goes hard, huh? What’d you see? What’d you hear?”



</p><p>It’s precise and complicated, students said. The guitars and drums are in conversation, mirroring each other. The drumming starts like black metal blast beats but switches into a groove. Rough vocals alternate with intelligible singing. Guitars are in standard tuning, not drop-tuning like most metal. The fashion is different from metal too – less theatrical. One student noted the singer’s contorted body language: “He’s feeling his emotions while he’s letting the art out of him.”



</p><p>“Mmm, beautiful,” Speicher said. Later, students looked at landscape photos and guessed which heavy genre or subgenre they represented: a frozen forest for black metal; a crumbling alley for doom; an urban protest for hardcore; an alligator swamp for death metal. They discussed “geographic determinism,” the theory that music is shaped partly by its place of origin.



</p><blockquote>
<p>“But there’s immense beauty here, too — extreme beauty. Our murals, our family networks, our ancient history, our language, the things that are binding us together for thousands of generations.”


</p></blockquote>

<p>But Speicher wasn’t just there to nerd out. He shifted seamlessly into an overview of heavy music’s therapeutic benefits: catharsis, community and coping skills. “Heavy music teaches us things such as we’re not alone; when life is dark, we do something about it. We’re not just a prisoner to that darkness. But also that our risk fluctuates, that our misery isn’t gonna last forever. There are ways through it.” Students doodled in notebooks, idly plucked at an unplugged bass guitar, or held hands under the table.&nbsp;



</p><p>A history lesson from another teacher on the ’80s and ’90s Scandinavian origins of black metal — including its problematic elements, like murder and Nazism among some bands — served as a caution to consume media critically. While hardcore is overtly political and tends hard left, the morality of metal is murkier, oriented primarily around pushing extremes and attacking social norms. Results can be chaotic. This segued into a high-level, student-led conversation about whether and when to separate art from artist. In another lesson, Speicher said, they’d studied the Vietnam War through the lens of Black Sabbath, whose 1970 staple “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ssFjyDIyQ0">War Pigs</a>” critiqued American involvement.

</p>



<p>“Your homework tonight, and I’ll remind you of this later, go listen to the song ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiKjcrniJKY">43% Burnt</a>.’” Speicher told students to pay special attention to an influential breakdown at the end. They broke off to paint each other’s faces in “corpse paint,” and take album cover-style photos with animal skulls and hides. Emily Edwards (Piikunii), an almost-15-year-old, schooled me on Swedish rock. “You don’t know Ghost?” she said. Inspired by the class, Edwards and some friends had started their own band, Crimson Harmony. Edwards was one of many students who signed up for a paid internship at an upcoming metal festival called Fire in the Mountains coming to Blackfeet Nation later that summer. Festival internships were part of why teachers started the symposium.&nbsp;



</p><p>Nicholas Rink (Piikunii), who teaches Blackfeet studies and language, pulled me aside, brimming with excitement. He was painting the skull of a buffalo the students helped process. Across its brow he’d painted overlapping bear paws, mother and cub, in flame colors. He dotted them with pinprick white stars — Ursa Major and Minor, which he said both Piikunii and European traditions recognize as bears. The skull was a gift for Norwegian festival headliners Wardruna, whose latest album, <em>Birna</em>, was named in honor of the bear. Rink had aligned the painted stars to match the position the real stars would take when Wardruna performed beneath them in Blackfeet Nation.

<h2><strong>The Firekeepers</strong></h2>

<p><strong>AS COVID ARRIVED IN 2020, </strong>a string of suicides ripped through the Blackfeet Nation, claiming multiple kids per year, some as young as 11. Speicher said it hit the entire community “like a sledgehammer.” He called up a fourth grade teacher in Rathdrum, Idaho, named Steve Von Till, whom metalheads might recognize as a doomy poet-troubadour and the former Neurosis guitarist. Speicher, Hall, Rink, Von Till and a few others banded together to help their students stay alive, as if building a protective fire to shelter them in the darkness. They called themselves the <a href="http://firekeeperalliance.org/">Firekeeper Alliance</a>.



</p><p>A few years earlier, the crunchy-pagan festival Fire in the Mountains was priced out of gentrifying Jackson, Wyoming. Speicher spoke to its owners about bringing the festival to the rez. He planned to build internships into his class to connect kids with career pathways in an industry of like-minded people. It sounded perfect. But first they needed buy-in from tribal council.



</p><p>The Blackfeet Tribal Business Council has long supported youth through athletics, especially running and basketball. Dipping into the arts, specifically music — to say nothing of metal — would be new territory. But Councilman Everett Armstrong told me that because it was for the kids, they considered it. “Let’s try to go a different route to give our youth something that they can open our minds to, open our hearts to, find themselves,” he said.



</p><p>It could help the nation economically, too, Armstrong said. The reservation lies along the imaginary line splitting Piikunii homelands into the colonial annex called Glacier National Park. The park is an <a href="https://www.nps.gov/glac/learn/news/tourism-to-glacier-national-park-contributes-548m-to-local-economy.htm">over-half-billion-dollar industry</a>. But many Piikunii people, Armstrong said, live in poverty. It’s one of the factors contributing to the widespread suicidal distress that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/data.html">disproportionately harms Native communities</a>. When I told folks I was going to Blackfeet Nation, most didn’t know where that was, until I mentioned Glacier. The monied Glacier Park Lodge had a gift shop peddling Glacier mementos — but, despite being on the reservation, offered nothing I could take home that says “Blackfeet Nation.” “We need to try to tap into that and try to get some revenue back into the Blackfeet Reservation,” Armstrong said.&nbsp;



</p><p>For the festival to work, they needed bands big enough to draw fans to the rez. So in August 2024, the Firekeepers flew to Boulder, Colorado, to court pagan folk band Wardruna, whose world tour was starting at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Speicher and the gang wanted to meet in person and convince them to play Blackfeet Nation. It’s for the children, they would say. Norwegian and Piikunii cultures share traditions of animism. The Firekeepers brought sweet pine ties, used for smudging, as gifts, and met Wardruna at the C.U. Boulder library. They didn’t know the band was already sold on the idea. Singer Einar Selvik had spoken to Speicher on the phone, and they were ready to say yes.



</p><p>“A chance to stand with (the) Indigenous in a constructive, powerful way, and a chance to visit a beautiful place and to do something that is more than just a festival, more than just a concert,” Selvik told me, “all the pieces just fit so well together.” It was a major get for the festival. Rink said they stayed up all night talking about it. Their vision and the Nordic stars had aligned.&nbsp;

<h2><strong>Dance Intertribal</strong></h2>

<p><strong>LATE JULY: AMTRAK UNLOADED A GAGGLE OF BLACK DENIM</strong> and bandanna-clad metalheads onto the small, sunny platform at East Glacier Park, Montana, a tiny seasonal town 15 minutes outside Browning. Two days earlier, Ozzy Osbourne, the grandfather of metal and lead singer of Black Sabbath, had died.

</p>



<p>Because it was the festival’s first time on a reservation, nobody knew what to expect. Festivals, after all, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/feb/27/fyre-festival-2-mexico">can go very badly</a>, and no one wanted to remember this as “Fyre” in the Mountains. But good omens greeted us. Our Lord and Savior Ozzy must have parted the week’s rainy spell for a few days of perfect festival weather: high 70s, partly cloudy, cool after sunset.&nbsp;



</p><p>The Firekeeper Alliance distributed tickets to the local community, and invited Blackfoot attendees from Canada. Others road tripped in, or flew into Kalispell, around 2,400 fans — a third of them Natives, Speicher and Rink estimated — converging from across the continent for three days and 23 bands.



</p><p>On the festival grounds, the party opened not with a land acknowledgement but a welcome from the land’s actual Indigenous people. In proper Native fashion, they held a grand entry, and true to form, it started late. “We’re runnin’ on Indian time!”&nbsp; shouted Hall through a megaphone, war-whooping and half-dangling from the back of a motorcycle that Speicher peeled across the rugged ground.



</p><p>As the crew finished setting up a stage in the distance, hundreds of metalheads sat watching in a circle while Piikunii locals in regalia danced fancy, traditional, chicken, jingle and grass. Young Grey Horse hammered the drum and Hall let his rowdy demeanor emcee, throwing out Charlie Hill jokes to keep the mood light. For many, it was a transformative moment. Some fans had never been to a powwow and were encountering Indigenous culture for the first time.



</p><p>Finally, Hall called for an intertribal — an all-inclusive dance. The metalheads hesitated, but after a few courageous outliers broke onto the grass, others followed, bouncing a circle in their battle vests and black jeans, like a respectful, slow-motion mosh pit, as they awkwardly tried to two-step like the pros. A showboating school-aged fancy dancer twirled past them in her shawl, rapid-fire footwork leaving them in the dust. But the dance was a welcome, not a competition. Hearts were opening. People cheered, Natives and non-Natives together.



</p><p>For Selvik, the powwow was a powerful way “to set the tone, to open the circle.” This festival required some vulnerability of attendees, some deference. We were guests on Piikunii lands. There would be no alcohol — a marked adjustment for metal culture. It would be, as Hall declared, “a cultural exchange between the Piikunii and metalheads.”



</p><h2><strong>Fringe Culture</strong></h2>

<p><strong>“ON MY RESERVATION, PEOPLE ONLY LISTEN TO TWO THINGS:</strong> rap or hip-hop,” joked Logan Mason (Colville), who traveled from Spokane and volunteered with the camping crew in exchange for festival admission. Mason lost his brother and nephew to suicide, and metal helped him work through depression in his late teens and early 20s. “Growing up, I did not know anybody else that listened to black metal or death metal.”&nbsp;



</p><p>On other reservations, it’s different. The Navajo Nation, for example, has a genre-defining “<a href="https://www.hcn.org/articles/photos-heavy-metal-music-in-the-navajo-nation-award/">rez metal</a>” scene. Some folks joke that you’re either a hip-hop Native or a metal Native. If anything, Natives seem over-represented in the metal community. “A lot of it is land-based,” said Meg Skyum (Oji-Cree), who’d come to the festival from Ontario to see the Native black metal outfit Blackbraid and get a sneak preview of their third album. Atmospheric black metal in particular is “about the fucking trees and shit,” which Natives appreciate. Plus, Natives and metalheads, Skyum added, both live in the margins of ordinary society. “We’re fringe, they’re fringe.”



</p><blockquote>
<p>“A chance to stand with (the) Indigenous in a constructive, powerful way, and a chance to visit a beautiful place and to do something that is more than just a festival, more than just a concert.”


</p></blockquote>

<p>“The metal tribe itself seems to attract a lot of people that go through different types of struggle,” said Tomas Falomir (Ojibwe, Hopi and Zuni Pueblo descent) from Parker, Colorado, noting that the music is healing, the community welcoming. “Any type of person could be included.”



</p><p>There’s also something about the sound, Falomir added. “It almost goes with the loudness, and even down to the beat of it.” Other fans agreed. The thundering drums and powerful vocals resemble a modernized version of Native music, one said. Pomona-based Indigenous death/doom project Tzompantli would later exemplify this, shaking the festival grounds with stomping downtempos from a battalion of traditional and contemporary drums. And European bands like Wardruna, fans noted, are really, <em>really</em> into their cultures, especially pre-Christian traditions, just like Natives.



</p><p>“A lot of people are into metal because of how much trauma that we go through in our daily lives. And not only in our own daily lives, but our historical trauma,” said Damien Jones Jr. (Diné), who traveled with family from Lukachukai in Navajo Nation, and brought one of the festival’s most-photographed battle vests, decked out with turquoise geometrics and a “Frybread Power” backpatch<em>.</em> Jones plays saxophone — classical and jazz. “That’s what I do as well, throw all my feelings and emotions into music.”

<h2><strong>Dark Horse, Ride</strong></h2>

<p><strong>“WELCOME TO THE BACKBONE OF THE WORLD,” </strong>read the sign at Red Eagle Campground, where the Rockies arched like the knobby vertebrae of a sleeping Elder God half-buried in sediment. Across glassy Two Medicine Lake an amphitheater of pines presided like a chorus between the water line and a low timberline. On the near bank, a footpath wound along the edge of the lake, opening to beach access here and there with pop-up canopies and scatterings of hay-bale seats for workshops and panels on Indigenous sovereignty, ethnobotany, the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous people, and the therapeutic effects of heavy music.



</p><p>A cluster of interconnected meadows transformed into parking lots, a village of glamping yurts, a small bazaar of vendor tents, and the “stage bowl”: a shallow glen with two stages set up between tipis serving as green rooms. Curtains of savory smoke stoked saliva as Montana “off-grid catering” team <a href="https://www.regionsauvage.com/">Region Sauvage</a> barbecued ducks and student-processed buffalo. High school interns decorated the stages with skulls, antlers, driftwood, witchy-Indigenous pieces of the forest. Edwards worked the merch tent, hawking Firekeeper Alliance shirts that showed a malevolent spirit of suicide haunting a tipi where Native kids sheltered around a fire. Proceeds supported suicide prevention. Shirts sold out the first day. Parking attendants and security all seemed suspiciously chill. It was intentional, they explained. Natives are used to being followed and scrutinized. Nobody wanted that atmosphere here.



</p><p>First on stage was Sage Bond (Diné and Nde), an up-and-coming acoustic metal singer-songwriter from Tonalea in Navajo Nation, who’d previously toured in support of suicide prevention efforts on her reservation. Bond matched the mountain sunshine with a low snarl a la Eddie Vedder, before breaking into a roar the size of 10 mountain lions — what she called “the Cookie Monster vocals.” Bond expected a sparse crowd drifting in and out, but her performance captivated hundreds. It was a big moment — her first time playing a festival that size, which she jokingly called a “black metal Coachella” (though the only feather headdresses were on tribal council members). “How the heck did they even find me?”



</p><p>Turns out Bond was recommended by Chicago black metal artists Pan-Amerikan Native Front. During their set, they invited students onstage to headbang alongside the singer, Kurator of War, in black-and-white face paint and crossed bullet sashes. Other students held up a Blackfeet Nation flag&nbsp; and tossed their long hair next to barrel-chested guitarist Necroboar (Purépecha), who looked mean as hell in spiked leather cuffs, but later, backstage, was beaming. “A lot of people are thanking us for being here with the kids,” Necroboar said, “but it’s like you don’t understand what this means to us to be here and to see them.” He told me he and his bandmates saw themselves in the teenagers. Misty-eyed fans agreed, knowing they would remember this moment forever. The band had rehearsed their set that morning at Buffalo Hide Academy with the kids. They’d always wanted to play a rez. Being here was a dream come true. “I’m still shaking from it,” Necroboar said.

<p>Musicians didn’t quarantine themselves. Many hung out with fans — riding horses, paddleboarding, doing yoga by the lake, attending workshops and panel discussions, or headbanging in the crowds. By the food stands selling frybread with huckleberry butter, metalheads set up a little table as an altar to Ozzy. It gathered river rocks, feathers, cigarettes, and trinkets. “Long Live the Prince of Darkness,” read a sign at the feet of a grinning Ozzy bobblehead and some candles.



</p><p>Twenty-four weeks pregnant, Heather Jordan (Diné) delivered a scorching set in the sunshine with her masked drummer pummeling the kit behind her. Jordan is the singer and guitarist for Navajo Nation blackened doomgaze duo Liłith. She’d wanted to play Fire in the Mountains because favorites like Wolves in the Throne Room preceded her. And it helped that this year’s festival focused on “the Native side of things.” Jordan works a day job at a restaurant serving tourists on her own rez, which is also dry. “It’s like the hardest thing for them to understand,” she said. When Fire in the Mountains invited Liłith, their answer was “Hell, yes.”



</p><p>The festival’s spirituality attracted Jon Krieger of Blackbraid, a solo recording project that blew up overnight when his first single, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buh0h-8zrP4">Barefoot Ghost Dance on Blood Soaked Soil</a>,” got traction on YouTube in 2022. “All the black metal that’s the best in the world in my opinion comes from the heart,” Krieger said. Blackbraid was one of around five Native bands playing the festival, though Krieger, who was adopted, doesn’t know his tribal affiliation. Black metal is a spiritual genre, he said, and while it’s dominated by “Scandinavian dudes talking about old Norse religion and culture,” the values align. “Anti-Christianity is something that we share with them.”



</p><blockquote>
<p>“A lot of people are into metal because of how much trauma that we go through in our daily lives. And not only in our own daily lives, but our historical trauma.”


</p></blockquote>

<p>On stage later, beneath an array of a dozen stag skulls, Krieger was slinking around like a ghostly Indigenous Jim Morrison, windmilling his waist-length hair, blasting life force through a cedar flute and leaning over the crowd to shriek upward-arcing shards — whose strength never flagged during his entire blistering set — as his guitarist crowned his howls with constellations of tremolo picking. In the mosh pit, one fan hoisted a buffalo rib the size of a baseball bat, presumably from the barbecue, like some feral invocation. Blackbraid’s performance may have converted Daniels, the photographer, to solid metal fandom. But after Converge, he stood by me and said, “Now I get it.”



</p><p>Converge was another get, one of Speicher’s favorites. Bassist Nate Newton had Zoomed into Speicher’s classroom to chat music with students. So had Ivar Bjørnson from Enslaved — A-listers, donating their time to Browning rez kids.



</p><p>Before Converge played, Speicher and the other Firekeepers presented them with a buffalo skull painted with the iconic <em>Jane Doe</em> face. And they gifted the buffalo’s tongue, the most prized part of the animal, to tribal council.



</p><p>A mosh pit opened in the center of the crowd as soon as Converge blasted forth, the biggest and most fearsome pit yet. The chaos of bodies in conflict summoned a dust devil from the Earth into the sky. It might not look like it, but there’s a shared ethic at work, what Hall called “consensual fucking violence, man.” If you get a bloody nose, you can be proud. If you fall, fans pick you back up. We aren’t fighting. By bracing and colliding, we’re helping each other. The rush is purifying. The release, stabilizing. Jumping in, you might want to die, but when the pit spits you out, you’ll be beaming like Necroboar — happy to have survived the maelstrom.



</p><div><p>Partway through Converge’s set, skinny, sleeve-tatted frontman Jacob Bannon passed the mic to a Piikunii youth, who seamlessly took over the chorus of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV4x5DsES9w">Dark Horse</a>.”</p><p><em>We’ll show the demons<br>For what they are<br>Dark!<br>Horse!<br>Ride!<br>Towards the light!</em></p></div><figure><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2000" height="1335" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=2000%2C1335&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 2500w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=2000%2C1335&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=1536%2C1025&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=2048%2C1367&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=780%2C521&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?resize=400%2C267&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/www.hcn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RAD_5690.jpg?w=370&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"><figcaption>The mosh pit during Converge’s performance. <span><span>Credit:</span> <a href="https://www.russeldaniels.com/">Russel Albert Daniels / High Country News</a></span></figcaption></figure>

<p>He knew every shout and scream by heart, absolutely commanding the stage. The crowd was living for it.



</p><p>Musicians understood the assignment and turned it up to 11, new blood and seasoned pros alike. As dusk settled, staff closed the lakeside trails, mindful of everyone’s safety, while Finnish folk metal band Hexvessel sang about people disappearing into the forests. After dark, fans gathered around a bonfire to ward off the chill. Wardruna took the stage and spread their haunting ambience to the woods’ inky edges. Someone dressed like a wizard slipped through the crowds as a human figure with antlers danced silhouetted before a glowing tipi. High above a membrane of diffuse gray, the bear stars slowly turned.



</p><p><strong>A Strange Road to Joy</strong>



</p><p><strong>A FULL MAP OF METAL’S SPRAWLING SUBGENRES</strong> is hard to pin down. But for what it’s worth, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Musical_subgenres_by_genre">Wikipedia lists 34 subgenres and 16 sub-subgenres</a> of metal, rivalled primarily by much broader genres like pop, rock, and opera, the latter which has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_opera_genres">120</a> subgenres. <em>Encyclopaedia Metallum</em> lists <a href="https://www.metal-archives.com/browse/genre">16 main subgenres</a>, but sub-subgenres and combinations seem unlimited.



</p><p>Like opera, much of metal prioritizes the voice — though as an aesthetic inversion. Similar to Inuit throat singing, vocalizations are guttural and challenging to master. Like wine, metal adheres to a pedigree whose sense experience reflects a place of origin: Cascadian black metal, for instance, is hazy as the misty forests of the Pacific Northwest. And like European classical music, or jazz, metal ranges in style from ambient drone to bombastic spectacle to precise and unpredictable arrangements astonishing to perform.



</p><blockquote>
<p>“We’ve all&nbsp;had periods&nbsp;of hurt. And this music was the medicine we didn’t know we needed until we’re in it.”


</p></blockquote>

<p>But something deeper draws metalheads together, perhaps a willingness to inquire on levels the establishment forbids. What most clearly sets it apart from other genres is that it’s so rooted in anger and sadness — or their common ancestors: terror, lack, isolation and despair. Metal, one fan told me, is “a strange road to joy.”



</p><p>“We’ve all had periods of hurt,” Kurator of War said, seated on a folding chair next to Von Till with singer-songwriter Chelsea Wolfe, Newton and Bjørnson. No makeup, no bullets. Behind them, morning clouds rippled like flags on the glacier-crisp pebble beds of Two Medicine Lake. “And this music was the medicine we didn’t know we needed until we’re in it.” A crowd of metalheads sat cross-legged on the grass, or perched on hay bales in the partial pine shade, listening to the panel. “I think we’re all curious. I think we’re all empathetic. I think we want to get to that other side of connection and knowledge.”

<p>Speicher lobbed questions that prompted an intimate conversation about the healing power of heavy music, which at times drew tears — from fans and musicians. Von Till said heavy music is a way of “getting rid of the sickness,” which helps him become more sensitive and vulnerable. He also noted the importance of catharsis. “How many times has that moment of release prevented that one moment in a kid that can’t be retaken?”



</p><p>Early in Bjørnson’s life, he realized people had to be athletic or good looking for acceptance in some groups. “With the metal gang, the qualification was being into metal,” he said.



</p><p>“It’s not like this kind of stuff attracts normal people. Like we all — you’re weird. You’re all weird,” Newton said to ripples of laughter and cheers. “And it’s beautiful. We could be completely different but we have this one thing that we both understand: why we’re into it.”



</p><p>“It’s them that are weird,” Von Till parried. “We’re the normal ones, right? Fuck that.” More cheers.



</p><p><strong>Oh, Lord, Yeah</strong>



</p><p><strong>ON THE THIRD DAY, THE SKY RENT IN TWO.</strong> Just as the evening drained of color, the power went out — halfway through a set by Virginia headbangers Inter Arma. They didn’t stop. Only the drum kit was audible without amps and mics, but the drummer kept spirits rolling as the minutes wore on, stage hands scrambling to patch the glitch.

<p>Sparse raindrops descended upon the crowd, but nobody seemed to care. Then the familiar tick of a tempo rose from the drummer’s high hat cymbals. The crowd started laughing, cheering, singing. It was “War Pigs” — Sabbath. Colorful stage lights fired back up. When the metalheads sang “Oh, Lord, yeah!” the sneer of Ozzy’s voice carried like mist across the many, a phantom formed by hundreds of mouths in unison. Re-amped guitars picked up the lick to complete the collective homage. Piikunii highschoolers sieged the stage again, drumming powwow style alongside the band.



</p><p>Nigh had the crowd caught its breath when lightning flashed like a Catholic schoolteacher flicking the lights. Thunder murmured from the belly of the Rockies beyond a ridgeline that blurred into rolling gray. Another flash. Closer, noted Daniels, the photographer; maybe two second’s delay. Sparse droplets swelled to a downpour. The lightless heavens opened, the Prince of Darkness summoned.



</p><p>“This is metal,” a festival staff member in a Day-Glo vest shouted to fans gathered under the merch tent. He wasn’t speaking metaphorically. The tent’s frame could draw lightning. “Shelter in your cars or tents!” he ordered. “Go, now! <em>Now!”</em> Metalheads scrambled for cover, evacuating in slick mud.



</p><p>Daniels and I found ourselves with some new friends, ducking into the yurt of one of the musicians, Rebecca Vernon, founder of Salt Lake City doom-sludge band SubRosa, who now performs a solo piano project called The Keening. She invited us in, offered us snacks, made sure we were all safe and hydrated. We laughed together, Natives and non-Natives, prisoners of the darkness, speculating about whether Inter Arma had summoned the spirit of Grandfather Ozzy and he was messing with us from — wherever he was. We worried the next set might be canceled. It was one of the headliners, Old Man’s Child, a fan favorite that helped define the Norwegian black metal sound in the early days. In over 30 years, Old Man’s Child had never played in the United States. But they’d agreed to play Blackfeet Nation.



</p><p>“Debuting in a setting like this adds depth to the moment,” singer Galder <a href="https://knotfest.com/blogs/from-the-artist/galder-discusses-old-man-s-child-s-homecoming-and-american-debut-at-fire-in-the-mountains">told the website <em>Knotfest</em></a> before the festival. “There’s something about the rawness and unpredictability of the natural world that mirrors what I try to capture in Old Man’s Child. The beauty in the darkness, the stillness before the storm, the feeling of something ancient just beneath the surface.” That ancient unpredictability may have just gotten the better of his grand North American debut.

<p>A scream rang through the night. Or a shout? It was hard to understand, like metal vocals. I unzipped the door flap. The rain had stopped. The shouts rang clearer a second time: “Show’s back on!” We jammed our feet back into soggy shoes and boots.



</p><p>It was fully nighttime when the storm’s misery passed. A string of fans with phone flashlights and headlamps meandered back down the muddy path and over a little footbridge, across a babbling brook to the clearing where the bonfire flared bright and warm between the stages, belching embers upward like some inverted underworld rain. From a distance, the returning metalheads looked like a serpent of stars.



</p><p>By firelight we danced with a Piikunii grandmother in a silk bandanna to Dio’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrBUjXaRSUQ">Rainbow in the Dark</a>,” euphoria setting in from the topsy-turvy snafu and the might of nature, which had banished all traces of late-festival fatigue. Then finally, riding in on the heels of the thunderstorm, Old Man’s Child took the stage. Galder, in corpse paint, dispatched legions of fog wraiths, strobe spectres galloping across a sea of electrified faces. A beautiful hell broke loose, exorcising our collective and personal demons. The festival — the ceremony — was complete.



</p><p><strong>‘Our ancestors held ceremony together’</strong>



</p><p><strong>ON SOCIAL MEDIA, FANS WERE STUPID WITH ENTHUSIASM </strong>about the weekend: <em>“Pure magic,”</em> <em>“transformational,”</em> <em>“profound,</em>”<em> “life changing.” </em>They posted reports of unexpected tears and healing. One Instagram comment called it the “the most incredible metal festival I’ve been to, and it was my 3rd one this summer.” Others called it the best music festival they’d been to of any genre. Daniels, newly baptized, joined the chorus: “<em>I have joined the cvlt.”</em>



</p><p>And it wasn’t just the music. The consensus seemed to be that the lack of alcohol actually enhanced the experience. Frank Godla, co-founder of digital publication <em>Metal Injection</em>, said he learned <a href="https://metalinjection.net/show-recap/fire-in-the-mountains-2025-rewrote-the-script-of-what-a-heavy-metal-fest-could-should-be">more about Native people at this festival</a> than he ever had from books or documentaries. Wardruna echoed the many in posting humble thanks to the Blackfeet Nation: “There are so many people out there in the world who deeply sympathize and stand with you and your ancestors in all your struggles. I am one of those people,” Salnik captioned a picture of himself on stage, proudly holding aloft the hand-painted buffalo skull. “It was like our ancestors held ceremony together and their meeting is rippling as we speak.”



</p><p>And the learning was two-way: Tribal Chairman Rodney “Minnow” Gervais took the stage to remark on how kind and diverse the metalheads were, how clean they kept the grounds. “Be proud of yourselves,” he said. “What you see here is proof that music transcends religion, color, whatever you want. It brings us all together.”



</p><p>“They look scary,” Councilman Armstrong told me about the metalheads, “but they’re some of the nicest people. They’re so welcoming.” People I spoke to in East Glacier agreed. Armstrong said tribal council is now considering branching into music events of other genres, too.



</p><p>“It’s heartwarming to have a full circle moment for me,” Mason, the fan from Spokane, said, seeing Native culture come together with the music he loves, in support of a cause close to his heart. “I was like damn, was this festival calling me?” After interning at the merch tent, Edwards said she might pick a different long-term job, but does see herself working in the music industry. And she wants to keep playing in a band when she is older, Crimson Harmony or otherwise.



</p><p>As stray metalheads sat around the grand foyer of Glacier Park Lodge, leaning on their backpacks or napping on the sofas, waiting for the evening train, a classical guitarist plucked out a polished-up version of the Led Zeppelin classic “Stairway to Heaven.” On the train back to the West Coast, the metalheads hung out as new friends. In the observation car, they shared weekend highlights, Natives and non-Natives together.



</p><p>A week later, I saw Von Till and Vernon again, this time in Portland, the last stop on Von Till’s summer tour before the new school year. We were still thinking about the festival. We tried to pin down what it was about Fire in the Mountains that still had us sobbing intermittently a week out. Von Till nailed it: “It made me dare to hope.”

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Did you know migratory birds and sea turtles are able to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field? It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoreception" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">magnetoreception</a>.

</ul>
<p>It would seem evolution <em>adores</em> detecting magnetic fields. And it makes sense! A literal "sense of direction" is quite useful in staying alive - nearly all life benefits from it, including us.</p>
<p>We don't totally understand how our magnetoreception works yet, but we know that it does. In 2019, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6494972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some Caltech researchers</a> put some people in a room shielded from the Earth's magnetic field, with a big magnetic field generator in it. They hooked them up to an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/eeg/about/pac-20393875" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EEG</a>, and watched what happened in their brains as they manipulated the magnetic field. The result: some of those people showed a response to the magnetic fields on the EEG!</p>
<p>That gets my noggin joggin. Our brain responds to magnetic field changes, but we aren't aware of it? What if it affects our mood? Would you believe me if I told you <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-022-01913-4.epdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lunar gravity influences the Earth's magnetosphere</a>? Perhaps I was too dismissive of astrology.</p>
<h3>But seriously</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomagnetism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biomagnetism</a> is "the phenomenon of magnetic fields produced by living organisms". Hold up. Produced by? I made another list for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1262183/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weakly electric fish</a> – electric organs generate pulsed currents whose surrounding magnetic fields (nanotesla scale) have been recorded directly near the fish.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1985.325434" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crayfish</a> – the giant axon’s action currents generate ~10⁻¹⁰–10⁻⁹ T fields measured directly with toroidal pickup coils.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humans</a> – multiple biomagnetic signals are routinely measured: heart fields (magnetocardiography), brain fields (magnetoencephalography), skeletal-muscle fields (magnetomyography) and peripheral-nerve fields (magnetoneurography).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, <em>right</em>. We run on electricity, so we generate magnetic fields. Makes sense. But wait. We can detect magnetic fields AND we produce them? That's...hmm. Interesting. Let's read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">magnetoencephalography</a> (insane word).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a functional neuroimaging technique for mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the brain, using very sensitive magnetometers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not the interesting thing about MEG. The interesting thing about MEG is that researchers at Meta, using MEG, were able to decode the brains magnetic fields into actual <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/brain-ai-image-decoding-meg-magnetoencephalography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">images</a> and <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/ai-speech-brain-activity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">words</a>. Who else forgot we successfully read people's minds in 2023? I know I did.</p>
<p>Here's how it worked: they trained models <em>on public MEG datasets</em>, and then used those models to decode the thoughts of study participants.</p>
<p>In their words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall, our results show that MEG can be used to decipher, with millisecond precision, the rise of complex representations generated in the brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read this back when it happened, but then I read it again the other day and it struck me that it's actually an insane line of research. Like, we can train a model to understand the information that underlies <em>human brain waves</em>. They were able to translate brain activity, from the magnetic field alone, into images and text.</p>
<p>So our brain's magnetic field is like a constant (with millisecond precision) readout of the current state of our brain? That's...HUH?</p>
<p>So, okay. Research has established that humans can sense magnetic fields, and Meta was able to show that our own brain's magnetic field represents a high-enough-fidelity-to-read-data analog representation of our current "state" of mind. To such an extent that we've been able to decode it across many different brains, despite barely understanding it.</p>
<p>So, couldn't our own brain be reading it's own field? I mean, what are the chances evolution <em>wouldn't</em> take advantage of an available wireless summary of the global state of the brain? Wouldn't that answer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the binding problem</a>?</p>
<h2>They're minerals, Marie!</h2>
<p>The question becomes <em>how does the brain read the field</em>? Well, let's go back to <em>magnetoreception</em> for a minute. How does that work again?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Magnetite biomineralization is a genetically-controlled biochemical process through which organisms make perfect ferrimagnetic crystals, usually of single magnetic domain size. This process is an ancient one, having evolved about 2 billion years ago in the magnetotactic bacteria, and presumably was incorporated in the genome of higher organisms, including humans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our brains <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996APS..MAR.M2002K/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>manufacture ferrimagnetic crystals</em></a>. Table stakes. Established science.</p>
<p>But let's not get too excited. The Earth's magnetic field is quite strong. In fact it's 50 to 500 MILLION times stronger than the brain's magnetic field. So these magnets could detect the Earth's magnetic field for sure, but could they detect the brain's own much weaker fields?</p>
<p>I'm here to tell you: hell yeah they could. Those ferrimagnetic crystals created by our brains <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-07988-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tend to be in a tight size range that could resonate with <em>and potentially modulate</em> the specific spectrum of known neural oscillations</a> (A.K.A. brain waves). This "stochastic resonance", which is mathematically possible in the brain, would allow for these tiny crystals to <em>locally overcome the Earth's magnetic field</em>.</p>
<p>So now we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>The brain's magnetic field can be read to extract the actual high-fidelity thoughts a person is having</li>
<li>The brain creates magnetic crystals that just so happen to be the perfect size to interact with it's own magnetic field</li>
</ul>
<p>Feels like we're getting somewhere. Let's pull the thread.</p>
<h2>Everything is computer</h2>
<p>If those crystals can <em>read</em> the brain's magnetic field, they can also certainly <em>write</em> to it. The brain's hardwiring/neurochemistry could manipulate the crystals much more easily than the magnetic field could.</p>
<p>So, using those biological magnets, could the brain...self-tune itself?</p>
<p>Let me zoom out. Here's how I'm thinking about it: the magnetic field seems to represent a current "state" of your thoughts. Nature loves analog systems. What if the brain used it's own magnetic field as a sort of analog compression of all of the underlying information? It definitionally represents the the sum total of all of the electrical activity in the neurons in the brain. It's as low-latency as it gets, limited only by the speed of light. We know our thoughts are encoded within it. Why not?</p>
<p>Let's imagine how this might work. We have this global state vehicle, we can read it with magnetic crystals, but how do we complete the loop? There would need to be some global write system, right?</p>
<h3>The blue spot</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_coeruleus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">locus coeruleus (LC)</a> (latin for "blue spot") is a tiny but obscenely important little part of our brain. It synthesizes "norepinephrine, which is a chemical that changes how alert, focused, and "plastic" (malleable) your brain is. I'll quote the Wiki:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The projections of this nucleus reach far and wide. For example, they innervate the spinal cord, the brain stem, cerebellum, hypothalamus, the hippocampus, the thalamic relay nuclei, the amygdala, the basal telencephalon, and the cortex. The norepinephrine from the LC has an excitatory effect on most of the brain, mediating arousal and priming the brain's neurons to be activated by stimuli.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The page continues to list all of the functions the LC-NA system is known to influence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arousal and sleep-wake cycle</li>
<li>Attention and memory</li>
<li>Behavioral and cognitive flexibility, creativity, personality, behavioral inhibition, and stress</li>
<li>Cognitive control</li>
<li>Decision making and utility maximization</li>
<li>Emotions</li>
<li>Neuroplasticity</li>
<li>Posture and balance</li>
<li>Global model failure where predictions about the world are strongly violated</li>
</ul>
<p>That sure sounds like a global write system.</p>
<p>Did I mention it's located at the center of the brain?</p>
<h3>Compacting...</h3>
<p>Let's summarize again.</p>
<ul>
<li>The brain's magnetic field can be read to extract the actual high-fidelity thoughts a person is having</li>
<li>The brain creates magnetic crystals that just so happen to be the perfect size to interact with it's own magnetic field</li>
<li>The brain has a single system that can, in response to stimuli, release a chemical that changes how the rest of the brain responds to stimuli</li>
</ul>
<p>So let's make this a causal loop.</p>
<ol>
<li>The brain creates a structured magnetic field pattern</li>
<li>Magnetic crystals, in reaction to that pattern, trigger neurons to send signals (some to the LC-NA system)</li>
<li>Based on the data the LC receives (danger, reward, big decision), it fires a burst of norepinephrine</li>
<li>That norephinephrine globally changes brain neurochemistry, which changes how magnetic crystals react to the magnetic field</li>
</ol>
<p>The brain could then use that process to heavily optimize itself <em>locally</em> based on <em>global</em> state.</p>
<h2>The easier-than-expected problem of consciousness</h2>
<p>So hold on, if the "brain computer" uses a lossy summary of <em>all neuron activity</em> to make decisions, doesn't that kind of sound familiar? Isn't a "lossy summary of all neuron activity" kind of equivalent to...what it feels like to be conscious?</p>
<p>Like, basically the brain is a computer, but imagine it has to compress all of this data into one dimension. "Feeling like" something is a compression artifact - it's a lossy representation of all of the underlying data. So, we're computers, but it feels like this to be a computer because of the way the data is compressed.</p>
<p>"What it feels like" to be conscious is the inevitable end result of...extremely optimized data compression. Incredible. Evolution is an unmatched engineer.</p>
<h2>Air pollution may be more serious than we realize</h2>
<p>The magnetic crystals created by our brains are not the only ones we've found in there. Among the perfectly shaped and sized biogenic crystals are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1605941113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pollution-derived magnetic particles</a> of many shapes and sizes that are prolific in urban, airborne particulate matter. We breathe this in through the nose, and it enters the brain directly through the olfactory nerve.</p>
<p>Now, remember how the natural magnetic crystals are a very specific size and shape that allows them to resonate with the brain's magnetic field and ultimately overcome the Earth's magnetic field. Above a certain volume, pollution-derived particles would significantly change the math in that system, and could very easily impact the ability for the brain's magnetic field to interact with it's own natural magnetic crystals.</p>
<p>So, there should be evidence of a system breakdown among people who breathe enough sufficiently polluted air. We would see a breakdown of ability to learn - significant issues with memory. It would build up over time and it's progression would be slow at first. The locus coeruleus in particular would become less active as the brain lost the ability to send signals to "self-tune" itself.</p>
<p>Air pollution has been <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/industrial-air-pollution-leaves-magnetic-waste-brain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">significantly correlated with Alzheimer's disease</a>. They've even recently demonstrated <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412024000989" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evidence of causation</a>.</p>
<p>And critically, where have we (inexplicably thus far) seen some of the earliest signs of Alzheimer's pathology?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8900465/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">locus coeruleus</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://fil-c.org/seccomp">https://fil-c.org/seccomp</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46259064">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <main>


<p>Memory safety and sandboxing are two different things. It's reasonable to think of them as orthogonal: you could have memory safety but not be sandboxed, or you could be sandboxed but not memory safe.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Example of <strong>memory safe</strong> <em>but not</em> <strong>sandboxed</strong>: a pure Java program that opens files on the filesystem for reading and writing and accepts filenames from the user. The OS will allow this program to overwrite any file that the user has access to. This program can be quite dangerous even if it is memory safe. Worse, imagine that the program didn't have any code to open files for reading and writing, but also had no sandbox to prevent those syscalls from working. If there was a bug in the memory safety enforcement of this program (say, because of a bug in the Java implementation), then an attacker could cause this program to overwrite any file if they succeeded at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_machine">achieving code execution via weird state</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Example of <strong>sandboxed</strong> <em>but not</em> <strong>memory safe</strong>: a program written in assembly that starts by requesting that the OS revoke all of its capabilities beyond just pure compute. If the program did want to open a file or write to it, then the kernel will kill the process, based on the earlier request to have this capability revoked. This program could have lots of memory safety bugs (because it's written in assembly), but even if it did, then the attacker cannot make this program overwrite any file unless they find some way to bypass the sandbox.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, sandboxes have holes by design. A typical sandbox allows the program to send and receive messages to broker processes that have higher privileges. So, an attacker may first use a memory safety bug to make the sandboxed process send malicious messages, and then use those malicious messages to break into the brokers.</p>

<p><strong>The best kind of defense is to have both a sandbox and memory safety.</strong> This document describes how to combine sandboxing and Fil-C's memory safety by explaining what it takes to port OpenSSH's seccomp-based Linux sandbox code to Fil-C.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p><a href="https://fil-c.org/how.html">Fil-C is a memory safe implementation of C and C++</a> and this site <a href="https://fil-c.org/documentation.html">has a lot of documentation about it</a>. Unlike most memory safe languages, Fil-C enforces safety down to where your code meets Linux syscalls and the <a href="https://fil-c.org/runtime.html">Fil-C runtime</a> is robust enough that it's possible to use it in <a href="https://fil-c.org/pizlix.html">low-level system components like <code>init</code> and <code>udevd</code></a>. <a href="https://fil-c.org/programs_that_work.html">Lots of programs work in Fil-C</a>, including OpenSSH, which makes use of seccomp-BPF sandboxing.</p>

<p>This document focuses on how OpenSSH uses seccomp and other technologies on Linux to build a sandbox around its <a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html">unprivileged <code>sshd-session</code> process</a>. Let's review what tools Linux gives us that OpenSSH uses:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>chroot</code> to restrict the process's view of the filesystem.</p></li>
<li><p>Running the process with the <code>sshd</code> user and group, and giving that user/group no privileges.</p></li>
<li><p><code>setrlimit</code> to prevent opening files, starting processes, or writing to files.</p></li>
<li><p>seccomp-BPF syscall filter to reduce the attack surface by allowlisting only the set of syscalls that are legitimate for the unprivileged process. Syscalls not in the allowlist will crash the process with <code>SIGSYS</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/0e94f26e8/docs/linux_sandboxing.md">The Chromium developers</a> and <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox/Seccomp">the Mozilla developers</a> both have excellent notes about how to do sandboxing on Linux using seccomp. <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.19/userspace-api/seccomp_filter.html">Seccomp-BPF is a well-documented kernel feature</a> that can be used as part of a larger sandboxing story.</p>

<p>Fil-C makes it easy to use <code>chroot</code> and different users and groups. The syscalls that are used for that part of the sandbox are trivially allowed by Fil-C and no special care is required to use them.</p>

<p>Both <code>setrlimit</code> and seccomp-BPF require special care because the Fil-C runtime starts threads, allocates memory, and performs synchronization. This document describes what you need to know to make effective use of those sandboxing technologies in Fil-C. First, I describe how to build a sandbox that prevents thread creation without breaking Fil-C's use of threads. Then, I describe what tweaks I had to make to OpenSSH's seccomp filter. Finally, I describe how the Fil-C runtime implements the syscalls used to install seccomp filters.</p>

<h2>Preventing Thread Creation Without Breaking The Fil-C Runtime</h2>

<p>The Fil-C runtime uses <a href="https://fil-c.org/fugc.html">multiple background threads for garbage collection</a> and has the ability to automatically shut those threads down when they are not in use. If the program wakes up and starts allocating memory again, then those threads are automatically restarted.</p>

<p>Starting threads violates the "no new processes" rule that OpenSSH's <code>setrlimit</code> sandbox tries to achieve (since threads are just lightweight processes on Linux). It also relies on syscalls like <code>clone3</code> that are not part of OpenSSH's seccomp filter allowlist.</p>

<p>It would be a regression to the sandbox to allow process creation just because the Fil-C runtime relies on it. Instead, I added a new API to <a href="https://fil-c.org/stdfil.html"><code>&lt;stdfil.h&gt;</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>void zlock_runtime_threads(void);
</code></pre>

<p>This forces the runtime to immediately create whatever threads it needs, and to disable shutting them down on demand. Then, I added a call to <code>zlock_runtime_threads()</code> in OpenSSH's <code>ssh_sandbox_child</code> function before either the <code>setrlimit</code> or seccomp-BPF sandbox calls happen.</p>

<h2>Tweaks To The OpenSSH Sandbox</h2>

<p>Because the use of <code>zlock_runtime_threads()</code> prevents subsequent thread creation from happening, most of the OpenSSH sandbox just works. I did not have to change how OpenSSH uses <code>setrlimit</code>. I did change the following about the seccomp filter:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Failure results in <code>SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS</code> rather than <code>SECCOMP_RET_KILL</code>. This ensures that Fil-C's background threads are also killed if a sandbox violation occurs.</p></li>
<li><p><code>MAP_NORESERVE</code> is added to the <code>mmap</code> allowlist, since the Fil-C allocator uses it. This is not a meaningful regression to the filter, since <code>MAP_NORESERVE</code> is not a meaningful capability for an attacker to have.</p></li>
<li><p><code>sched_yield</code> is allowed. This is not a dangerous syscall (it's semantically a no-op). The Fil-C runtime uses it as part of its lock implementation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing else had to change, since the filter already allowed all of the <code>futex</code> syscalls that Fil-C uses for synchronization.</p>

<h2>How Fil-C Implements <code>prctl</code></h2>

<p>The OpenSSH seccomp filter is installed using two <code>prctl</code> calls. First, we <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if (prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1, 0, 0, 0) == -1) {
        debug("%s: prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS): %s",
            __func__, strerror(errno));
        nnp_failed = 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This prevents additional privileges from being acquired via <code>execve</code>. It's required that unprivileged processes that install seccomp filters first set the <code>no_new_privs</code> bit.</p>

<p>Next, we <code>PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if (prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, &amp;preauth_program) == -1)
        debug("%s: prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP): %s",
            __func__, strerror(errno));
else if (nnp_failed)
        fatal("%s: SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER activated but "
            "PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS failed", __func__);
</code></pre>

<p>This installs the seccomp filter in <code>preauth_program</code>. Note that this will fail in the kernel if the <code>no_new_privs</code> bit is not set, so the fact that OpenSSH reports a fatal error if the filter is installed without <code>no_new_privs</code> is just healthy paranoia on the part of the OpenSSH authors.</p>

<p>The trouble with both syscalls is that they affect the calling <em>thread</em>, not all threads in the process. Without special care, Fil-C runtime's background threads would not have the <code>no_new_privs</code> bit set and would not have the filter installed. This would mean that if an attacker busted through Fil-C's memory safety protections (in the unlikely event that they found a bug in Fil-C itself!), then they could use those other threads to execute syscalls that bypass the filter!</p>

<p>To prevent even this unlikely escape, the Fil-C runtime's wrapper for <code>prctl</code> implements <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code> and <code>PR_SET_SECCOMP</code> by <em>handshaking</em> all runtime threads using this internal API:</p>

<pre><code>/* Calls the callback from every runtime thread. */
PAS_API void filc_runtime_threads_handshake(void (*callback)(void* arg), void* arg);
</code></pre>

<p>The callback performs the requested <code>prctl</code> from each runtime thread. This ensures that the <code>no_new_privs</code> bit and the filter are installed on all threads in the Fil-C process.</p>

<p>Additionally, because of ambiguity about what to do if the process has multiple user threads, these two <code>prctl</code> commands will trigger a Fil-C safety error if the program has multiple user threads.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The best kind of protection if you're serious about security is to combine memory safety with sandboxing. This document shows how to achieve this using Fil-C and the sandbox technologies available on Linux, all without regressing the level of protection that those sandboxes enforce or the memory safety guarantees of Fil-C.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                                <p>A former Dyson engineer is rolling out a revolution for household chores in deprived communities after inventing an off-grid, flat-packable washing machine</p>
                
                                
    		    <div>
        <p><span>Some five billion people in remote and developing regions still wash their clothes by hand. It’s a task that unfairly burdens women and young girls, who can spend up to 20 hours a week on the chore.</span></p>
<p><span>Enter Navjot Sawhney, who founded the UK-based social enterprise </span><a href="https://www.thewashingmachineproject.org/"><span>The Washing Machine Project</span></a><span> (TWMP) to tackle this, and has now shipped almost 500 of his hand-crank Divya machines to 13 countries, including Mexico, Ghana, Iraq and the US.</span></p>
<p><span>The Divya washing machine, made up of an outer drum and an inner one which rotates, operates a 30-minute wash cycle where it completes a 5kg load needing only a few minutes of manual turning. </span></p>

    </div>

    		    <div>
        <p><span>It works </span><span>like this</span><span>: after loading the clothes, detergent and water, and letting it sit for 10-15 minutes, users can close the lid and turn the handle for two minutes, repeating this twice more after ten minutes of letting the clothes sit in between spins. And voila — the machine can then be drained using the tap at the front.</span></p>
<p><span>This saves up to 75% of time for its user, and halves water consumption. “The machine takes a task that is exhausting and time-consuming and transforms it into something simple, easier to manage, and time saving,” said Sawhney.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Divya project’s development didn’t end with its invention. “We went back to the drawing board and really listened to the people we were designing for, for the context in which they lived. That research changed everything,” said Laura Tuck, the organisation’s R&amp;D Lead.</span></p>

    </div>



                    
    		

                    
    		    <div>
        <p><span>One crucial consideration was making sure Divyas were fit for the locations where they would be used. For example, in Uganda, machines were delivered to a small island on Lake Victoria using a fishing boat. Repairs or replacements could not get there easily, so the TWMP team needed to rethink how the originally complex gear-system machine could work in these conditions. The solution? Designing a product that was simpler, more intuitive, and repairable locally using the skills and infrastructure available.</span></p>
<p><span>Guided by feedback from real users during workshops and focus groups, TWMP improved the machine’s durability, physical strain, and usability, with the team introducing robust metal frames, simplified workflows, and improved seals and taps.</span></p>
<p><span>The innovation has already impacted the lives of almost 50,000 people – and Sawhney is just getting started.</span></p>
