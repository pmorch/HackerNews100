<p>It's been nearly 10 years since
<a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.0/">KDE&nbsp;Plasma&nbsp;5</a>,
which is the last major release of the <a href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/">desktop</a>.
On February&nbsp;28 the project <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/">announced</a> its "mega release" of KDE
Plasma&nbsp;6, KDE Frameworks 6, and KDE Gear&nbsp;24.02 — all based on the <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/qt6">Qt&nbsp;6</a> development framework. This
release focuses heavily on migrating to Wayland, and aspires to be a seamless
upgrade for the user while improving performance, security, and support
for newer hardware. For developers, a lot of work has gone into removing
deprecated frameworks and decreasing dependencies to make it easier to write
applications targeting KDE.</p>

<h4>What's in Plasma 6</h4>

<p>For the purpose of this article, we'll mostly look at Plasma and <a href="https://develop.kde.org/products/frameworks/">Frameworks</a>, as Gear&nbsp;24.02
contains too many applications like KMail, Kate, and the Kdenlive
video editor that deserve more attention in their own right. I ran <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/kinoite/">Fedora
Kinoite's</a> <a href="https://planet.kde.org/siosms-blog-2023-11-21-kinoite-nightly-images-with-plasma-6/">nightly</a>
releases with pre-release Plasma&nbsp;6 packages, which has proved pleasantly
stable and performant on an aging ThinkPad&nbsp;X280 with 16GB of RAM and a
Core&nbsp;i7-8650U CPU.</p>

<p>The difference between Plasma&nbsp;5 and 6 is apparent, but not
pronounced. Users who are comfortable with Plasma&nbsp;5 are unlikely to feel
discomfited with Plasma&nbsp;6, or have a hard time adapting to the changes
sprinkled throughout the desktop. Plasma&nbsp;6 has
a number of changes to default settings. The big change, of course, is <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/2188">Wayland
as the default</a> graphical session.</p>

<p>Plasma&nbsp;6 also has a smattering of smaller, less controversial changes. For example, prior to
Plasma&nbsp;6, the desktop defaulted to single-click to open a folder, launch a
program, or open a file. Users coming from other operating systems or
Linux desktop environments are often used to double-clicking to do these
things. Now, KDE upstream has relented on using a single-click to open files and
defaults to double-click instead. Distributions like Fedora, Kubuntu, and
Manjaro had been changing the upstream default anyway, so KDE developer Nate Graham <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/72">suggested</a>
disabling the feature. "<q>Distros are closer to users and clearly the feedback they've been
getting is that double-click is a better default...Let's admit it and switch
to double-click by default ourselves</q>".</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/963854/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/Plasma-6-sm.png" alt="[KDE Plasma 6 desktop]" title="KDE Plasma 6 desktop"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Plasma&nbsp;6 is also supposed to do away with the default of using the scroll
wheel on the desktop to switch virtual desktops. However, this setting is
still active in Fedora Kinoite as of this writing. Scrolling to switch virtual
desktops has been the default for some time, but Graham argued in another <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/55">proposal</a>
to disable the feature because it can easily surprise users with unexpected
and unwanted behavior. Users who prefer the old behavior can toggle it
back on in the "Mouse Actions" settings under "Desktop Folder Settings",
so it's not going away entirely. Another change to scrolling behavior
in this release is that clicking on a scrollbar moves the window to
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/92">the
location clicked</a>, rather than one "page" at a time. This is meant to
reduce the amount of fiddling with the scroll wheel to move up or down a long
"distance", in order to be a better option for users with repetitive strain injuries
(RSIs) — or for users who'd like to avoid RSIs in the first place.</p>

<p>Breeze is Plasma's default theme and it has been updated for Plasma&nbsp;6, but it's a subtle change
— sort of like repainting a room and changing the color from "flat white"
to "eggshell white". It has some changes to spacing that make it feel a
little less crowded, and it has fewer lines separating UI elements. The System
Settings application has also been revamped. This may be more noticeable, as
some of the settings have migrated to new locations. The nice thing about KDE
is that so much is configurable, but finding configuration settings is still
a challenge in Plasma&nbsp;6. For example, the aforementioned setting to scroll
virtual desktops is found in the Desktop Folder Settings application, but
not in the System Settings application under the Virtual Desktop settings.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.kde.org/dolphin/">Dolphin</a>, KDE's file manager,
had its configuration settings redesigned to make them easier to navigate. The
prior version of Dolphin included six tabs of settings for navigation, its
context menu, startup behavior, view modes, behavior of the trash, and
general settings. The redesign condenses this into four tabs, scooting the
navigation options and startup options into the new interface tab. It also adds
a fifth tab for user feedback, with options to contribute statistics and
participate in surveys. These are, as one would expect from an open-source
project that respects its users, set to share no data by default. Users
who wish to participate, though, can choose just how much participation
they're willing to engage in. This ranges from sharing just a few details
like version of the application and operating system, to more telemetry
like screen resolution, time Dolphin is used, how many network shares are
available, and more.</p>

<p>The Dolphin interface changes are minor. Instead of showing recent
files from today and yesterday, Dolphin now shows recent files and recent
locations. Settings for file history are system-wide, and found in System
Settings rather than Dolphin's settings — users can opt for keeping
history "forever" or a period of months, or turn off history entirely. (Days or
hours do not appear to be an option.) Users can also specify the applications
allowed to access file history, rather than granting access to any application.

</p><p>Plasma&nbsp;6 on Wayland has some support for <a href="https://zamundaaa.github.io/wayland/2023/05/18/hdr-and-color-management-in-kwin.html">high
dynamic range (HDR) and color management</a>, depending on the application
and if one has a supported monitor. Sadly, the monitors I have on hand are not
supported. One thing that did work nicely, however, was setting the
scaling for a laptop monitor and external monitor, independently. It was easy to set the
external monitor to 100% scaling while the ThinkPad screen was set to 125% so that windows appeared
to be the same size when moved from one monitor to the other.</p>

<p>The Plasma Search feature, which is part of <a href="https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Krunner">KRunner</a> and the
<a href="https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Kickoff">Kickoff</a>
application launcher, has been <a href="https://write.as/alexander-lohnau/profiling-and-optimizing-krunner">refactored</a>
and is claimed to be much faster in this release. The release announcement
claimed major speedups for searching local documents and for applications,
while reducing CPU usage. It's hard to verify this, but KRunner did feel snappy
when performing web and document searches. <a href="https://apps.kde.org/spectacle/">Spectacle</a>,
KDE's screenshot utility, now takes screenshots and recordings of the entire desktop, an application
window, or just a selection of the screen. This promises to be a handy tool
to create tutorials, or share a recording of application behavior when filing
a bug.</p>

<p>KDE giveth, and KDE taketh away. As is common with major updates, some
features and settings have been removed due to design changes or difficulty
with underlying drivers or software. For example, GUI configuration for <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/merge_requests/1509">Synaptics
touchpads</a> and <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man4/evdev.4.xhtml">evdev</a>
input devices has been removed because the drivers have been superseded with <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/what-is-libinput.html">libinput</a>
in Wayland. Unmaintained features like the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/57">Air theme</a>,
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/65">icon
view for System Settings</a>, and <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/khotkeys/-/merge_requests/23">KHotkeys</a>
were all scuttled in this release. The ability to grab
wallpapers from the Unsplash free stock image site was removed due to <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kdeplasma-addons/-/merge_requests/422">API
changes</a> and the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kdeplasma-addons/-/merge_requests/487">QuickShare
applet</a> for file transfer was dropped because it never worked as
intended.</p>

<h4>Under the hood</h4>

<p>Even though Plasma&nbsp;6 may not feel like a major update, a lot of work has gone
into KDE&nbsp;Frameworks&nbsp;6 to make it possible. I asked KDE developer
Carl Schwan by email about the developer-facing changes and plans for KDE&nbsp;5 now
that Plasma&nbsp;6 has been released. Schwan said most of the work in
Frameworks&nbsp;6 was about reducing rather than adding features. Schwan pointed
to removal of deprecated frameworks, like KHtml, the KJS javascript engine,
and KHotkeys. The project has also worked to get rid of deprecated Qt APIs,
such as QtCodecs, and to decrease dependencies between frameworks so external
Qt applications can just use one or two KDE frameworks. Schwan also said that
KDE has removed a lot of APIs "which were barely used or [...] have better
alternatives either in another framework or in Qt itself". In particular,
he noted that KDE's plugin system has moved from two APIs to a single API.</p>

<p>Schwan said that Qt&nbsp;6 itself didn't have many API changes, but
it did add an abstraction layer for graphics APIs like Metal, Vulkan,
OpenGL, and DirectX "instead of only supporting OpenGL+Angle". In
addition, Qt has switched to <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>, away
from the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qmake-manual.html">qmake</a>
build system, which Schwan said helped a lot to improve developer
tooling. Finally, Qt&nbsp;6 brought a number of improvements to <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtwaylandcompositor-index.html">Qt Wayland</a>,
which Schwan said had been driven forward in part by KDE developers.</p>

<h4>Support for KDE 5 and X11</h4>

<p>Plasma&nbsp;6 is likely to be a little
bit rough around the edges for a while, and users might want to review <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/buglist.cgi?bug_severity=critical&amp;bug_severity=grave&amp;bug_severity=major&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=CONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;classification=Applications&amp;classification=Plasma&amp;keywords=qt6%2C%20&amp;keywords_type=allwords&amp;list_id=2462812&amp;query_format=advanced">known
issues</a> before deciding to upgrade. Obviously
Plasma&nbsp;6 won't be immediately available in most
distributions, but users can refer to KDE's community wiki for <a href="https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_6#How_to_use/test_it">instructions</a>
on how to test Plasma&nbsp;6 right away. Users can choose to <a href="https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/Build_software_with_kdesrc-build#Plasma">build
from source</a>, try the <a href="https://neon.kde.org/download">KDE neon</a>
testing edition, or try one of the other distribution-specific methods for
Fedora, Gentoo, KaOS, NixOS, or openSUSE.</p>

<p>There is no rush to switch — KDE&nbsp;5 is not quite out of the picture
just yet. On February&nbsp;12, on the Plasma development list, David Edmundson <a href="https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/plasma-devel/2024-February/123325.html">said</a>
he'd seen enough patches that should go
into&nbsp;5.27 to warrant another release. Justin Zobel <a href="https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/plasma-devel/2024-February/123329.html">agreed</a>
and noted that "<q>many distros won't [adopt] it for some
time. Major bugfixes and security fixes should definitely
continue being applied until such time that most major distros
have updated to 6</q>". Valorie Zimmerman, from the Kubuntu project, <a href="https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/plasma-devel/2024-February/123331.html">said</a>
this is good news since the next long-term support (LTS) release for Kubuntu is
coming in March and won't be based on Qt&nbsp;6. On February&nbsp;19, Jonathan Riddell <a href="https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/plasma-devel/2024-February/123333.html">reported</a>
the Plasma team planned to do a Plasma&nbsp;5.27.11 release on March&nbsp;6.</p>

<p>Even though many in the Fedora project are eager to <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/961899/">drop X11 support</a>, KDE upstream
plans to continue including X11 support for users who depend on it in the
short term. Users can expect to see support
in Plasma&nbsp;6 as well, but Schwan says there's "no fixed timeline" with
various estimates ranging from two to five years before support is fully
removed. He stressed that there will be "plenty of communication
beforehand" and the project "certainly won't drop the support from
one day to the other".</p>

<p>Overall, Plasma&nbsp;6 looks to be a smooth upgrade for users, and
KDE&nbsp;Frameworks&nbsp;6 seems to be a solid foundation for the next few
years of KDE development. It should be interesting to watch how 
Plasma evolves over the next few years.</p><br clear="all">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h2 id="questions-about-billing-changes-between-march-and-may-2024"><a href="#questions-about-billing-changes-between-march-and-may-2024" aria-label="questions about billing changes between march and may 2024 permalink"></a>Questions about billing changes between March and May 2024</h2>
<h3 id="what-will-change-about-the-way-that-hetzner-calculates-the-invoice-for-march-2024-and-why"><a href="#what-will-change-about-the-way-that-hetzner-calculates-the-invoice-for-march-2024-and-why" aria-label="what will change about the way that hetzner calculates the invoice for march 2024 and why permalink"></a>What will change about the way that Hetzner calculates the invoice for March 2024 and why?</h3>
<p>We are in the process of changing our billing structure to make it more unified; by doing this, we hope to make our products more user friendly.</p>
<p>As part of this process, we will change the billing for many of our products from monthly to hourly. Some products will be based on consumption. This structure will be similar to our Cloud billing. It will take effect in March 2024.</p>
<p>If you use a product for the whole month, we will continue to invoice you for the same monthly amount as always.</p>
<p>During the transition period, which will start with the March 2024 invoice, you may see some unusual things on your invoice. Below, you can see an <a href="#example-invoices">example</a> of what these changes may look like during the transition period.</p>
<p>Just to make it clear, the montly price you will pay will NOT change, even if you see some short-term changes in monthly totals on your invoices during the transition period.</p>
<p>It is possible that you will see a smaller-than-normal total on your invoice for March. In April, we will retro-actively invoice you for March for any hourly-based products; the invoice will be pro rata (proportional to the amount of hours in March that you used those products.)</p>
<h3 id="why-will-my-march-invoice-be-different-from-my-earlier-invoices"><a href="#why-will-my-march-invoice-be-different-from-my-earlier-invoices" aria-label="why will my march invoice be different from my earlier invoices permalink"></a>Why will my March invoice be different from my earlier invoices?</h3>
<p>Starting in April, we will only invoice customers for the services that they have used <strong>AFTER</strong> the month that they use those services.</p>
<p>For that reason, the March invoice will NOT contain any products whose prices we already calculated in March under the old billing structure. That's why your invoice for March may have a smaller total that normal.</p>
<p>The affected products (the ones with hourly-based billing) for March will then appear retro-actively on the APRIL invoice, but with the new hourly based billing.</p>
<p>Please take a look at the <a href="#example-invoices">example invoices below</a>.</p>
<h3 id="why-will-my-april-invoice-be-different-from-my-earlier-invoices"><a href="#why-will-my-april-invoice-be-different-from-my-earlier-invoices" aria-label="why will my april invoice be different from my earlier invoices permalink"></a>Why will my April invoice be different from my earlier invoices?</h3>
<p>Your April 2024 invoice will be the first one that is based on hourly billing. It will cover your hourly usage for the month of March. The hourly billing will apply to most products, but not all. For example, it will not apply to one-time products (like setup fees) or to products like domains and SSL certificates, which will continue to have yearly payment periods.</p>
<p>For this one time, the invoice will retro-actively cover products that were NOT covered on March's invoice as part of the transition period.</p>
<p>After that (starting in April) all future invoices will have a service period for hourly-based products. The service period will start on the first day of the month and end on the last day of the month. If you use these products for a full month, you will see the normal monthly price.</p>
<p>For more details, please look at the section below <a href="#example-invoices">("Example invoices")</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-will-be-new-in-the-may-invoice"><a href="#what-will-be-new-in-the-may-invoice" aria-label="what will be new in the may invoice permalink"></a>What will be new in the May invoice?</h3>
<p>By the time you get your May invoice, the transition period will be finished.</p>
<p>The May invoice will show you the products that you used in April. For hourly-based products, you will see how many hours you used each product for April. If you have used the product for the entire month of April, you will see the normal monthly price. If you use the product for less than a month, and the hourly calculation is less than the monthly total, we will charge you the smaller hourly-based amount.</p>
<p>For more details, please look at the section below <a href="#example-invoices">("Example invoices")</a>.</p>

<p>There may be a one-time delay in when we send you your April invoice. We apologize for that in advance and ask you for your understanding. Naturally, we will extend the time that you will have to pay your April invoice. In the months following April, we will send you invoices regularly and on time.</p>
<h3 id="why-am-i-now-receiving-my-invoice-on-a-different-day-of-the-month"><a href="#why-am-i-now-receiving-my-invoice-on-a-different-day-of-the-month" aria-label="why am i now receiving my invoice on a different day of the month permalink"></a>Why am I now receiving my invoice on a different day of the month?</h3>
<p>We want to provide you with better and quicker customer service in the future when you have billing questions. That's why we have decided to spread out the days of the month when we send out invoices to customers. You will always receive your invoice on the same day of the month. But this day will be different from customer to customer. This will allow our support team to answer billing questions more quickly.</p>
<p>We sent you an email informing you about this change; it had the subject line "Changes to the billing model".  We sent you this email between 29 February and 15 March. You can find a copy of this email <a href="#email-from-hetzner">below</a>. You can find your new billing day by going to <a href="https://accounts.hetzner.com/invoice" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">your account</a>.</p>
<h3 id="example-invoices"><a href="#example-invoices" aria-label="example invoices permalink"></a>Example invoices</h3>
<p>Example: You have two servers, Server A and Server B under the old billing model.</p>
<p>Server A had a service period of 21 February to 20 March.
Server B had a service period of 27 January to 26 February.</p>
<p>In <strong>February</strong> you received, as usual, an invoice for both servers with their two different service periods:

    </span></p>
<p>In <strong>March</strong>, you will NOT see any products on the invoice that will have a service period that extends into April 2024.</p>
<p>To be specific in this example, only Server B would appear on March's invoice because its service period does not fall into April. It only goes from 27 February to 26 March.</p>
<p>Server A, on the other hand, has a service period that would extend into April. So it would NOT be calculated on the March 2024 invoice. That's why the invoice for this example for March would be smaller.</p>

    </span></p>
<p>Now let's imagine that you order another server, Server C, in March, and Hetzner gives you access to the server on 15 March.</p>
<p>The <strong>April</strong> invoice will be the first retro-active invoice. It will include the service period of March for any products that have not already been calculated in March's invoice:</p>

    </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Server A for 21-31 March (previous invoice calculated in February)</li>
<li>Server B for 27-31 March (previous invoice calculated in March)</li>
<li>Server C for 15-31 March (new product; first invoice)</li>
</ul>
<p>The calculation for these invoices is based on hourly usage.</p>
<p>Now let's imagine that you cancelled Server A and that cancellation takes effect on 31 March. To replace this server, you order a new one, Server D, which Hetzner gives you access to on 20 April.</p>
<p>The invoice for <strong>May</strong> will include the service period from the previous month, April. So you would see the full service period for April listed for each server. Since you used Server B and Server C for the whole month, you would see the full monthly price there. And since you only used Server D for part of the month of April, you would see the calculation there based on hourly usage.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no. For the foreseeable future, it will not be possible to change the date that we issue your invoice to you. We're sorry about that.</p>
<h3 id="how-precisely-does-hetzner-calculate-the-hourly-billing"><a href="#how-precisely-does-hetzner-calculate-the-hourly-billing" aria-label="how precisely does hetzner calculate the hourly billing permalink"></a>How precisely does Hetzner calculate the hourly billing?</h3>
<p>The beginning of the hourly billing starts as soon as the product becomes available to you. We always round up when calculating the hourly use. If you only use the product for a few minutes, we will charge you a full hour. If you use the product for close to a month, and the montly price is cheaper, we will always charge you the cheaper monthly price rather than a higher hourly price.</p>
<h3 id="when-will-hetzner-charge-me-the-hourly-price"><a href="#when-will-hetzner-charge-me-the-hourly-price" aria-label="when will hetzner charge me the hourly price permalink"></a>When will Hetzner charge me the hourly price?</h3>
<p>We will always use the hourly price when it saves you money, meaning when you have used a product for less than a month, and the total hourly price is less than the monthly price.</p>
<h3 id="when-does-the-time-for-the-hourly-price-start"><a href="#when-does-the-time-for-the-hourly-price-start" aria-label="when does the time for the hourly price start permalink"></a>When does the time for the hourly price start?</h3>
<p>It starts when Hetzner makes the product you ordered available to you. This is true even for products that you use for just a short period of time.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-pay-in-yearly-payment-periods"><a href="#can-i-pay-in-yearly-payment-periods" aria-label="can i pay in yearly payment periods permalink"></a>Can I pay in yearly payment periods?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately not. In the new system, we only allow monthly payments. However, you can make automated payments with two different payment options to help make it easier to make your payments. You can do automated payments using SEPA bank transfers or credit cards.</p>
<p>Important note: It is not always possible to do automated payments. There may be some exceptions.</p>
<h3 id="email-from-hetzner"><a href="#email-from-hetzner" aria-label="email from hetzner permalink"></a>Email from Hetzner</h3>
<p>I don't have the email from Hetzner about the new billing structure at hand.
What is changing?
Starting in March 2024, almost all of our products will have consumption-based and hour-based billing, similar to our Cloud products.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you?</p>
<p>Consumption-based billing: The invoices for these products is based on the service we provide. This means you always receive an invoice for the previous month.</p>
<p>Hour-based billing: Billing is based on the actual usage time in hours. There are some exceptions: products with an annual fee (domains and SSL certificates) and licences. These products' invoices are based on the entire calendar month regardless of when during the month you order them. If you use the products for a whole month, you will be charged the monthly price as usual.</p>
<p>What is important during the changeover phase in March and April?</p>
<p>During the changeover phase, your products will be charged pro rata (based on the proportion of the month). This may result in different invoice amounts for March and April. The changeover will happen automatically. You do not need to take further action. Your monthly price will not change.</p>
<p>What is important after the changeover?</p>
<p>We want to be able to offer you even better customer service in the future. For that reason, we want to change the date of your invoice. This will make it easier for us to quickly answer questions about your invoices.</p></article></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.lumafield.com/article/heinzs-sustainable-ketchup-cap">https://www.lumafield.com/article/heinzs-sustainable-ketchup-cap</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39547109">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Heinz has taken a major step forward for sustainable packaging with the introduction of its first fully recyclable ketchup cap, made possible through a pioneering collaboration with <a href="https://www.berryglobal.com/en/news/articles/kraft-heinz-introduces-first-fully-recyclable-ketchup-cap-with-help-from-berry-global">Berry Global</a>. Combining complex engineering with simple materials, Heinz’s achievement offers a model for manufacturers in the <a href="https://www.lumafield.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods-cpg">consumer packaged goods (CPG)</a> space to strive for waste reduction by designing more environmentally-friendly products.</p><p>Industrial CT is the perfect tool for exploring the intricacies of Heinz's new cap design without damaging it, even while it’s fully assembled and closed. Let’s take a look.</p><h3>Mono-material construction</h3><p>The old cap featured a silicone valve, which posed recycling challenges. The new cap's uniform composition of polypropylene (PP) simplifies recycling and can be accepted by any facility that processes plastic #5. Currently only about 3% of PP products are being recycled in the United States, but it is becoming more widely accepted. The new cap appears as a uniform color in Voyager’s range map, indicating that it’s entirely made of the same material. Compare it to the old cap, whose silicone valve is denser than the surrounding plastic.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63e15418201b6e2a5cabb911/65cbc42a80870f285b2d0c15_4fHOwfEnbmCcBVmnYkFB_8Yt0l5Nos-j_Zh6BBRvX5i688yB0SuadxUlj4lQI9ei4m1n0bYLt2qS3Oy8Hw3eVAXXIVp9mK4mla6hsoEeug2iWtnd0VDZpHm7v2u8iUhUm-fpP9SBhdSm-CWdLB2HqGY.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The dense silicone ring (left) presents obstacles for recycling. The new mono-material cap (right) is of a uniform density.</figcaption></figure><h3>Innovative valve design</h3><p>The new design leverages ketchup's shear-thinning property to dispense the perfect amount. Ketchup requires a specific amount of pressure to flow. When the bottle is squeezed, it moves through the outer channels where the wall separating them from the inner channels plays a crucial role. The wall prevents the ketchup from flowing back and directs it toward the antechamber, building the necessary pressure for the ketchup to pass through the nozzle efficiently.</p><p>Once the squeezing stops, the ketchup's viscosity increases, preventing drips and mess. This design ensures a clean and controlled dispense of the product.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63e15418201b6e2a5cabb911/65cbc42a7b0050f7e8c59d86_CuLl6RDCU0dCWfdZnp8_4ofr0EsloqxIcsUNWJfHyHov9INxT77P_Nc9CpKqyY9hgS0Q3HuCaABFJXu1rtT6U7c0S4m9v83eZMlqdEz8qHTYPg40ZHjyA0sFZnAJW-J-Jx7B1dK41isnpiKOLGjaTpk.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Views from below (left) and above (right) of the Heinz ketchup cap's valve channels</figcaption></figure><h3>Industrial CT and sustainability</h3><p>Developing sustainable packaging can present a significant engineering challenge. Recyclable plastics often don’t perform as well as their non-recyclable counterparts, and reducing material usage can mean that safety factors are reduced as well. Effective, sustainable packaging requires careful design and lots of fine tuning.</p><p>Industrial CT plays a pivotal role in the development of sustainable packaging, offering a non-invasive method to analyze, refine, and perfect packaging solutions. By reducing the need for physical prototypes, CT scanning accelerates the development process, cuts down on waste, and helps avoid the costs associated with scrapped prototypes and recalled products. It embodies the convergence of innovation and sustainability, offering a blueprint for the packaging industry's next steps.</p><p>Heinz's recyclable cap is more than just an innovation; it's a statement of intent, reflecting a broader commitment to environmental sustainability. The cap's successful redesign, fueled by a $1.2 million investment and extensive testing, demonstrates the potential for significant waste reduction—up to 300 million plastic caps annually—and a future where packaging is fully recyclable, reusable, or compostable.</p><h3>Learn more</h3><p>Download our free white paper <strong>Removing Obstacles to Sustainable Packaging</strong> and discover how industrial x-ray CT can help packaging engineers create solutions that work.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>Something happened earlier this year where I got on a run making checkbox animations and just couldn’t stop.</p>
<p>A bit of background: back in pre-pandemic 2020, I went to <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">the Recurse Center</a> for a week and built <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/checkboxland/">Checkboxland</a>, a JavaScript library that lets you display text and animations on a checkbox grid. It was a fun little project. I made some demos, <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2020/06/06/checkboxland/">blogged about it</a>, and ultimately put it on the shelf where I didn’t touch it for about a year.</p>
<p>Eventually, I was feeling desperate for a fun coding diversion so I picked it back up again. I wanted to try making better and more complex animations so I started building a ripple effect, and got hooked.</p>
<h2 id="mathematical-animations">Mathematical Animations</h2>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/cbl-ripple.gif" loading="lazy" alt="A ripple animation made with html checkboxes.">
<figcaption>The ripple animation. See <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2021/04/15/ripple-animation-in-javascript/">my write-up about ripples</a> for more details.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Building the ripple forced me to dig into some animation math. I soon realized that I could use similar techniques to build other animations, including these ones:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/cbl-spiral.gif" loading="lazy" alt="A spiral animation made with html checkboxes">
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/cbl-pinwheel.gif" loading="lazy" alt="A pinwheel animation made with html checkboxes">
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/cbl-circles.gif" loading="lazy" alt="A checkerboard animation made with html checkboxes">
</p>
<p>Whenever I’d show someone an animation like this, they’d often try to click the checkboxes to see what would happen. This never did anything—the animation would just override their clicks.</p>
<p>That was pretty disappointing, so I wanted to try making animations that responded to clicks.</p>
<h2 id="interactive-animations">Interactive Animations</h2>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/cbl-lasers.gif" loading="lazy" alt="A laser animation made with html checkboxes.">
<figcaption>A "laser" animation. <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/checkboxland/docs/demos/lasers/">Try it here</a>.</figcaption>

<figcaption>A "pulse" animation. <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/checkboxland/docs/demos/pulse/">Try it here</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The more interactive demos I made, the more ideas I had. I could make games! <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/checkboxland/docs/demos/snake/">Snake</a>, Pong, Tetris!</p>
<p>But before I got too far down that path, another thought caught hold in my mind. If I could display any image, then I wouldn’t have to go through the laborious process of defining every checkbox manually or coming up with an algorithm for the scene I wanted.</p>
<h2 id="images">Images</h2>
<p>Converting images seemed tricky so I sat on the idea for while until I came across <a href="https://www.jonathan-petitcolas.com/2017/12/28/converting-image-to-ascii-art.html">this excellent article on converting images into ASCII text</a>. A short while later I was converting images:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/cbl-nike.png" alt="The Nike logo displayed side-by-side with an html checkbox version"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/cbl-apple.png" alt="The Apple logo displayed side-by-side with an html checkbox version"></p>
<p>I soon realized that converting images gets you 90% of the way to converting video so that became my next task.</p>
<h2 id="videos">Videos</h2>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/cbl-video.gif" loading="lazy" alt="A video animation displayed side-by-side with an html checkbox version.">
<figcaption>An mp4 video (left) powering a checkbox animation (right). <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/checkboxland/docs/demos/video-test/">Try other videos (or upload your own) here</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Soon I had extended the Checkboxland API so I could load any video (like ones from <a href="https://giphy.com/">giphy</a>) and instantly generate a checkbox version. Now checkbox animations were trivial.</p>
<p>This also meant I could display webcam data, which got a lot of attention on Twitter when I shared it:</p>
<blockquote data-dnt="true">

</blockquote>

<p>Finally, my co-worker Reed told me about a challenge where people try to play the animated video “Bad Apple” on various obscure computing environments (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLajlU5EKJVdonUGTEc7B-0YqElDlz9Sf9">a bunch of examples here</a>). It sounded fun so I went ahead and put together a youtube video for that.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/checkboxland/docs/demos/bad-apple/">Play the in-browser version here</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr>
<p>This whole process has been fun but I really ought to stop.</p>
<p>I got <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd sniped</a>, hard. Sure it’s harmless fun, but I’m starting to feel guilty spending months tinkering on these things when I’ve got the tools and skills to put actually useful stuff into the world. <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2018/02/18/the-cure-for-boredom-is-superpowers/">I feel like Superman</a>, using his powers to fry an egg.</p>
<p>Plus, if I keep doing this then I’m going to end up known as “the checkbox guy.” That’s not exactly marketable but I guess it could be worse.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it feels like I’m starting to exhaust the interesting things I could build in this format. At some point it’s like “dude, we get it, you can make anything with checkboxes.” I still have a few lingering ideas though… maybe it’s like a controlled forest fire and I should just let myself keep making these things until it burns itself out.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://apiiro.com/blog/malicious-code-campaign-github-repo-confusion-attack/">https://apiiro.com/blog/malicious-code-campaign-github-repo-confusion-attack/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39545676">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    
<p>Our security research and data science teams detected a resurgence of a malicious repo confusion campaign that began mid-last year, this time on a much larger scale. The attack impacts more than 100,000 GitHub repositories (and presumably millions) when unsuspecting developers use repositories that resemble known and trusted ones but are, in fact, infected with malicious code.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-do-repo-confusion-attacks-happen-nbsp">How do repo confusion attacks happen?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Similar to dependency confusion attacks, malicious actors get their target to download their malicious version instead of the real one. But dependency confusion attacks take advantage of how package managers work, while repo confusion attacks simply rely on humans to mistakenly pick the malicious version over the real one, sometimes employing social engineering techniques as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this case, in order to maximize the chances of infection, the malicious actor is flooding GitHub with malicious repos, following these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Cloning existing repos (for example: TwitterFollowBot, WhatsappBOT, discord-boost-tool, Twitch-Follow-Bot, and hundreds more).</li>



<li>Infecting them with malware loaders.</li>



<li>Uploading them back to GitHub with identical names.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Automatically forking each thousands of times.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Covertly promoting them across the web via forums, discord, etc.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-what-happens-when-the-malicious-repos-are-in-use">What happens when the malicious repos are in use?</h2>



<p>Once unsuspecting developers use any of the malicious repos, the hidden payload unpacks seven layers of obfuscation, which also involves pulling malicious Python code and later a binary executable. The malicious code (largely a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/Inplex-sys/BlackCap-Grabber-NoDualHook?tab=readme-ov-file#-%E3%80%A2-features">BlackCap-Grabber</a>) would then collect login credentials from different apps, browser passwords and cookies, and other confidential data. It then sends it back to the malicious actors’ C&amp;C (command-and-control) server and performs a long series of additional malicious activities.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/banana4.gif" alt=""></figure>



<h2 id="The-automation-effects-on-GitHub">The automation effects on GitHub</h2>



<p>Most of the forked repos are quickly removed by GitHub, which identifies the automation. However, the automation detection seems to miss many repos, and the ones that were uploaded manually survive. Because the whole attack chain seems to be mostly automated on a large scale, the 1% that survive still amount to thousands of malicious repos. You can check out a small portion of the current wave yourself by simply searching the following in GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%F0%9F%94%A5+2024+language%3Apython&amp;type=repositories&amp;s=updated&amp;o=desc"><em>🔥 2024 language:python</em></a>.</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="277" src="https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-12-1024x277.png" alt="" srcset="https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-12-1024x277.png 1024w, https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-12-300x81.png 300w, https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-12-768x208.png 768w, https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-12-1536x415.png 1536w, https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-12.png 2028w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Counting the removed ones, the number of repos reaches millions. Usually the removal happens a few hours after the upload, so it’s challenging to document them. We know the removal is automated because many of the original ones still exist, and it mainly targets the fork bombs. For example, <a href="https://github.com/Mattia69?tab=repositories">here</a> you can see thousands of forks appear in the summary but <a href="https://github.com/Mattia69/discord-vanity-sniper/forks">none in the details</a>.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/fork-bombs.gif" alt=""></figure>



<p>Because of the operation’s large scope, this campaign has a sort of 2nd-order social engineering network effect when, every now and then, naive users fork the malicious repos without realizing they are spreading malware. Kind of ironic to see it spreading by humans after such heavy reliance on automation.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-did-the-campaign-start">When did the campaign start?</h2>



<p>Here is a brief history of this malicious campaign:</p>



<p><strong>May 2023: </strong>As <a href="https://blog.phylum.io/respawning-malware-persists-on-pypi/">originally reported by Phylum</a>, several malicious packages were uploaded to PyPI containing early parts of the current payload. These packages were spread by ‘<em>os.system(“pip install package”)</em>’ calls planted in forks of popular GitHub repos, such as ‘chatgpt-api’.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>July – August 2023: </strong>Several malicious repos were uploaded to GitHub, this time delivering the payload directly instead of through importing PyPI packages. This came after PyPI removed the malicious packages, and the security community increased its focus there. Aliakbar Zahravi and Peter Girnus from Trend Micro published <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_be/research/23/j/infection-techniques-across-supply-chains-and-codebases.html">a great technical analysis of it</a>.</p>



<p><strong>November 2023 – Now: </strong>We have detected more than 100,000 repos containing similar malicious payloads, and the number keeps growing. <strong>This attack approach has several advantages:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>GitHub is huge, therefore despite the large number of instances, their relative portion is still insignificant and thus hard to detect.</li>



<li>Package managers are not involved as before, therefore explicit malicious package names are not mentioned, so that’s one less indicator.</li>



<li>The targeted repos are in a small niche and have low popularity, making it easier for unsuspecting developers to make the mistake and clone their malicious impersonators.</li>
</ul>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="873" height="455" src="https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Malicious-Package-Timeline.png" alt="" srcset="https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Malicious-Package-Timeline.png 873w, https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Malicious-Package-Timeline-300x156.png 300w, https://apiiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Malicious-Package-Timeline-768x400.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 873px) 100vw, 873px"></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-transition-of-malware-from-package-managers-to-scms">The transition of malware from package managers to SCMs</h2>



<p>Judging by the many incidents we have observed in package managers and SCM platforms, the transition of this campaign from malicious packages in PyPI to malicious GitHub repos seems to reflect a general trend. It seems that nowadays, the security community puts extra focus on package managers, so that was to be expected.</p>



<p>The ease of automatic generation of accounts and repos on GitHub and alike, using comfortable APIs and soft rate limits that are easy to bypass, combined with the huge number of repos to hide among, make it <strong>a perfect target for covertly infecting the software supply chain.</strong></p>



<p>This campaign, along with dependency confusion campaigns plaguing package registries and generally malicious code being spread through source control managers, demonstrates how fragile software supply chain security is, despite the abundance of tools and available security mechanisms.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-protect-yourself-against-repo-confusions">How to protect yourself against repo confusions</h2>



<p>GitHub was notified, and most of the malicious repos were deleted, but the campaign continues, and attacks that attempt to inject malicious code into the supply chain are becoming increasingly prevalent. There are countless solutions for catching malware at the system and network levels, but the supply chain remains a massive and lucrative attack surface for malicious actors.</p>



<p>At Apiiro, we’ve built a malicious code detection system that monitors any connected codebases. We then detect attacks by using deep code analysis using multiple advanced techniques: <a href="https://apiiro.com/blog/llm-code-pattern-malicious-package-detection/">LLM-based code analysis</a>, deconstruction of the code into a complete execution flow graph, an elaborate heuristics engine, dynamic decoding, decryption, and deobfuscation, and more, so it’s very hard to fool it.</p>



<p>Without monitoring your code for injected malicious payloads, the security of your whole organization is determined by things like the ability of your developers to not choose the wrong repo, which is almost identical, not having a single CI/CD misconfiguration, having 100% secure 3rd party code, and other impossible conditions. That’s where Apiiro’s <a href="https://apiiro.com/product/aspm/">deep application security posture management (ASPM)</a> platform comes in, going beyond typical vulnerability detection and ingestion to surface the next generation of software supply chain and application risks.</p>

As long as I was flying out to Vancouver, I wanted to meet Professor</span><a href="https://spph.ubc.ca/faculty/mariana-brussoni/" rel=""> Mariana Brussoni</a><span>, who had been writing important work on the value of outdoor risky play. Our hour-long meeting expanded my thinking about risk and play, and helped me write Chapters 2 and 3 of </span><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/729231/the-anxious-generation-by-jonathan-haidt/" rel="">The Anxious Generation</a><span>.&nbsp; Mariana quickly joined my pantheon of experts on play, along with Lenore Skenazy and Peter Gray.

I liked Mariana and her work so much that I gave her an open-ended invitation to write whatever she wanted at After Babel. Here is her essay, laying out her findings in a format that parents and schools can use. A concise summary of her work is this simple sentence, which she said to me during our meeting: “Children should be kept as safe as necessary, not as safe as possible.”</span></em></p><p><strong>— Jon</strong></p><p>We parents are caught in a paradox. We desperately want to keep our children safe and ensure their success. We are also often terrified that they will get hurt and that they will fail—so we do everything we can to prevent that from happening. Yet many of those very efforts to manage our fears have paradoxically reduced our children’s safety and their odds of success.&nbsp;</p><p><span>For over two decades, I have </span><a href="http://outsideplay.org/" rel="">researched</a><span> children’s development, injury prevention, and outdoor risky play.

Where were you? What were you doing?&nbsp; Was there an adult supervising you?</p><p><span>Adults in many Western nations, particularly those born before the 1990s, </span><a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/330/article/896673/summary" rel="">recall playing with friends</a><span> in their neighborhoods, local parks, and abandoned places, making up the rules as they went along, without adult supervision. They often recall a sense of joy, fun, and freedom as they would run, jump, and move their bodies in ways that weren’t allowed indoors. They felt independent, taking risks and figuring things out for themselves. And this is the kind of childhood that has </span><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-01219-022" rel="">been common</a><span> for nearly all of human history. Children, like all young mammals, play.</span></p><p><span>Today, this kind of childhood is rare. Every successive generation of children since the 1970s has seen their outdoor play and freedom shrink. Time use data show that children’s leisure time has gone down, particularly time spent in unstructured outdoor play, while time spent in academic and screen-based activities has increased.&nbsp; </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1468-4446.12369" rel="">Between 1975 and 2015</a><span>, outdoor play among UK children decreased by 29.4%, while screen-based activities increased by 22.4%. </span><a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/20852679" rel="">In the U.S</a><span>., only 16% of children in 1997 played outdoors every day.

On the surface, it’s not clear why a need for risky play would evolve across species, if it increases the chances that something bad will happen to those who partake in it. But when we dig a little deeper, its benefits become obvious. Risky play provides children with low-cost opportunities to develop the physical and cognitive skills to master the challenges that they will face as they grow older. So, those who engaged in it had a major </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/147470491100900212" rel="">evolutionary advantage</a><span> over those who did not. &nbsp; Physically, risky play allows children to explore more diverse movements and gain physical movement skills. </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21594937.2022.2152531" rel="">Cognitively</a><span>, it helps them overcome their fears, build their critical thinking skills, and become accustomed to coping independently with difficult situations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Risky play can even help children </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10567-020-00338-w" rel="">overcome anxiety disorders</a><span> and the cognitive distortions that go along with them. Anxious children have difficulty tolerating uncertainty, tend to interpret ambiguity negatively and underestimate their ability to cope in uncertain situations. Through risky play, children practice dealing with strong ambiguous emotions (thrill and excitement could also be interpreted as fear and terror) and situations that abound with uncertainty. It can also show them that they are resilient and capable of coping when things go wrong. </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10578-022-01363-2" rel="">Research </a><span>shows that children with more opportunities for risky play have lower internalizing symptoms that are characteristic of anxiety disorders.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In fact, the Canadian Paediatric Society sees risky play as so important, and as a way to address many of the challenges that their patients face, that they recently released a </span><a href="https://cps.ca/en/documents/position/outdoor-risky-play" rel="">statement</a><span> encouraging pediatricians to support it in patients’ lives.</span></p><p>With all of these benefits… and the evolutionary impulse for it… why has risky play been disappearing so rapidly?</p><p><span>Among the most important factors driving the loss of risky play and childhood freedom is the move toward </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-44156-1_2" rel="">intensive parenting</a><span> that began in the 1980s.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-142031950" href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-children-need-risk-fear-and-excitement#footnote-2-142031950" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> Parents, particularly mothers, have been encouraged to micro-manage their children’s lives, curate their experiences, remove any barriers, and enroll them in diverse structured activities with the intention of enhancing their development and giving them an edge in the race to succeed. This approach to parenting has become like the air we breathe—</span><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26931463" rel="">widely accepted in North America</a><span>—with parents of all backgrounds held to its unrealistic standard regardless of whether they can afford the necessary time, money, and energy.</span></p><p><span>This costly parenting strategy has negligible benefits at best, and can even be harmful. </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10826-014-0035-0" rel="">Research</a><span> shows that enrollment in structured activities is not associated with improved developmental outcomes, and the </span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00593/full?_ga=1.242929867.851339493.1400829831" rel="">loss of free time</a><span> can be detrimental to developing basic </span><a href="https://developingchild.harvard.edu/guide/a-guide-to-executive-function/" rel="">executive function</a><span> skills.

Parents today receive constant messaging that in order to be “good parents”, they must always keep their children safe. And it is widely believed that the world is </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/11/20/facts-about-crime-in-the-u-s/" rel="">no longer a safe place</a><span> for children to play in. Yet statistics show that it has never been a safer time to be a child. Injury-related deaths are at an all-time low in most Western nations. In the US, </span><a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0767" rel="">deaths from unintentional injuries fell</a><span> by 73% for boys and 85% for girls between 1973 and 2010. This misperception of risk creates the parental paradox.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>What kids </strong><em><strong>are</strong></em><strong> dying from today are mainly car crashes and suicides, not playing outside unsupervised with friends. </strong><em><strong>Parents are worrying about the wrong causes of injuries and harm</strong></em><strong>. In fact, the very strategies that parents use to try to keep their children safe – driving them around, maximizing supervision, and minimizing freedom – are unintentionally increasing the likelihood of injuries and even death.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>The problem lies not with our intentions. We all want children to thrive. The problem is in the decisions we’ve made to support this noble goal. We’ve prioritized safety over freedom, achievement over play, and screen time over outdoor time. The results are predictable: compromised </span><a href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-play-deficit" rel="">mental </a><span>and </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352464218302785?via%3Dihub" rel="">physical health, cognitive development</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12643" rel="">emotional competence</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The solutions are both simple and hard. We know what children need to thrive. The three key ingredients necessary for thriving play environments are </span><em><strong>Time, Space, and Freedom.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Time: </strong></em><span>Make daily outdoor playtime a priority. That can mean adding it to the schedule, much like we already do for sports or other extra-curricular activities. But schools should also take steps to prioritize outdoor instruction and recess. This can be particularly important for children from disadvantaged families without ready access to safe and stimulating outdoor environments. Parents and educators can use the U.S. Play Coalition’s</span><a href="https://usplaycoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Need-for-Recess-2019-FINAL-for-web.pdf" rel=""> position paper on recess</a><span> to advocate for more recess in schools.&nbsp; My research lab also developed a free teacher </span><a href="https://teacher.outsideplay.org/" rel="">tool</a><span> to help encourage outdoor learning, which includes short how-to videos to help overcome common barriers that teachers face.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em><strong>Space:</strong></em><span> Children need easy access to stimulating spaces for play; flexible spaces where they can use their imagination and explore risks, rather than spaces dominated by boring play structures and strict rules. Unfortunately, these kinds of spaces are harder and harder to come by as more parking lots and highways are built to accommodate a growing number of cars. At a legislative level, we need to move away from municipal planning that prioritizes cars over people–an important step that a number of North American cities have already taken. Outside of legislation, there is much that individuals can do, even with the little space that is available. For example, “loose parts” (e.g., sticks, lumber, rocks, boxes, and tarps) can turn boring and barren play spaces into places of joy and wonder.While these may look like junk to adults, children love them. Scotland developed</span><a href="https://www.inspiringscotland.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Loose-Parts-Play-Toolkit-2019-web.pdf" rel=""> a loose parts toolkit</a><span> for anyone who wants to get started. Some cities also have adventure playgrounds—child-centered, child-directed play spaces that are rich in loose parts. (Such playgrounds always have adult staff on hand, but the staff stays in the background unless serious safety risks arise.). See New York’s</span><a href="https://www.play-ground.nyc/" rel=""> play:groundnyc</a><span> as one example.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2aa15956-a96b-4dfe-95be-19f047e70cfc_1600x1200.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2aa15956-a96b-4dfe-95be-19f047e70cfc_1600x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2aa15956-a96b-4dfe-95be-19f047e70cfc_1600x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2aa15956-a96b-4dfe-95be-19f047e70cfc_1600x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2aa15956-a96b-4dfe-95be-19f047e70cfc_1600x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2aa15956-a96b-4dfe-95be-19f047e70cfc_1600x1200.jpeg" width="591" height="443.25" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2aa15956-a96b-4dfe-95be-19f047e70cfc_1600x1200.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:591,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Adventure playground in NYC&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Adventure playground in NYC" title="Adventure playground in NYC" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2aa15956-a96b-4dfe-95be-19f047e70cfc_1600x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2aa15956-a96b-4dfe-95be-19f047e70cfc_1600x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2aa15956-a96b-4dfe-95be-19f047e70cfc_1600x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2aa15956-a96b-4dfe-95be-19f047e70cfc_1600x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em><strong>Image.</strong><span> Adventure Playground in New York City.&nbsp;Credit: Jon Haidt.</span></em></figcaption></figure></div><p><em><strong>Freedom: </strong></em><span>Children need freedom to be able to play the way they choose. The biggest barrier to children’s freedom is us—the adults in their lives—and our need to manage our own fears.

Peter Gray suggests that building tighter relationships with neighbors can help parents feel more confident about letting their kids out to play.

One of the limitations of AMD's open-source Linux graphics driver has been the inability to implement HDMI 2.1+ functionality on the basis of legal requirements by the HDMI Forum. AMD engineers had been working to come up with a solution in conjunction with the HDMI Forum for being able to provide HDMI 2.1+ capabilities with their open-source Linux kernel driver, but it looks like those efforts for now have concluded and failed.
</p><p>
For three years there has been a bug report around <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1417">4K@120Hz being unavailable via HDMI 2.1</a> on the AMD Linux driver.  Similarly, there have been bug reports like <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1442">5K @ 240Hz not possible</a> either with the AMD graphics driver on Linux.
</p><p>
As covered back in 2021, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/HDMI-Closed-Spec-Hurts-Open">the HDMI Forum closing public specification access is hurting open-source support</a>. AMD as well as the X.Org Foundation have been engaged with the HDMI Forum to try to come up with a solution to be able to provide open-source implementations of the now-private HDMI specs.
</p><p>
AMD Linux engineers have spent months working with their legal team and evaluating all HDMI features to determine if/how they can be exposed in their open-source driver. AMD had code working internally and then the past few months were waiting on approval from the HDMI Forum... Sadly, the HDMI Forum has turned down AMD's request for open-source driver support.
</p><p>
AMD Linux engineer Alex Deucher <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1417#note_2303163">commented</a> on the ticket:
</p><blockquote>"The HDMI Forum has rejected our proposal unfortunately.  At this time an open source HDMI 2.1 implementation is not possible without running afoul of the HDMI Forum requirements."</blockquote>
<p>Thus a sad day for open-source GPU drivers with no apparent solution to safely implement HDMI 2.1+ functionality within open-source display drivers...

<p>Needless to say, open-source Linux advocates should try to use DisplayPort instead if at all possible.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section1"><h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<div id="section1"><h3>1.1. The characteristics of SDG 7 goal, variables, and target levels</h3>
<p>In September 2015, 193 United Nations member states adopted the resolution “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” containing 17 Sustainable Development Goals [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref001">1</a>]. Goal 7: “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” includes three core targets, which are to be achieved by 2030 [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref002">2</a>, p. 19/35]:</p>


<ol>

<li><span>7.1. </span>Ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services.</li>

<li><span>7.2. </span>Increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.</li>

<li><span>7.3. </span>Double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.</li>

<li><span>7.a. </span>Enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology.</li>

<li><span>7.b. </span>Expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States and landlocked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programs of support.</li>

</ol><p>Progress towards reaching core targets of SDG 7 is measured by selecting an appropriate set of indicators. The global indicator framework (United Nations, 2022) contains 248 SDG Indicators for 17 SDGs. Indicators for SDG 7 included in the UN publication and 2030 targets for OECD countries based on [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref003">3</a>] are presented in <a href="#pone-0297856-t001">Table 1</a>.</p>
<p>The main research goal of the study described in this is to assess progress in achieving core targets of SDG 7 by EU member states in the period 2010–2021 and determining their distances in relation to the goals set for 2030. Since 2017 Eurostat has published an “Annual EU SDG indicator review” (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdi/information-on-data">https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdi/information-on-data</a>), which contains an updated list of indicators for 17 SDGs (SDGs in the EU context). Seven indicators, defined in 2017 to monitor progress on SDG 7, have not changed until now. They are systematically monitored and assessed by Eurostat. Only three indicators from this list are consistent or partially consistent with UN Global list indicators (see <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a>).</p>
<p>The following 2030 targets for the seven indicators used to monitor progress on SDG 7 achieved by UE member states have been adopted in the study (see the last column in <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a>):</p>


<ol>

<li>a. In the case of „Primary energy consumption”, „Final energy consumption” and “Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption”, targets for 2030 are the same as those set by the European Commission [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref007">7</a>]. Since indicators of energy consumption (primary, final) are expressed in absolute terms (million tonnes of oil equivalent–mtoe), they cannot be used to compare different EU countries because these quantities are not directly comparable. For this reason, absolute values were replaced with indices representing changes in primary and final energy consumption in relation to values recorded in 2005 (Index 2005 = 100);</li>

<li>b. If no target value can be found in the 2030 Agenda, it is based on “best performance” among EU countries for 2015 year. This is defined as:


<ul>

<li>the 90th percentile for stimulants–i.e., the level attained in 2015 by the top 10% of EU27 countries. A similar approach was proposed by OECD [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref003">3</a>, p. 23] taking into account data for OECD countries;</li>

<li>the 10th percentile for destimulants–i.e., the level attained in 2015 by the top 10% of EU27 countries.</li>

</ul></li>

</ol><p>The analysis is based on average data for the European Union and for 27 EU countries separately from the period 2010–2021. The study includes Croatia, which joined the EU in 2013 and excluded the UK, which left the EU in January 2020. All statistical data come from Eurostat.</p>
<p>Of the seven indicators listed in <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a>, the biggest number of countries achieved in 2021 the EU target for x7 (Share of population unable to keep home adequately warm). The target was set at 1.88%, and the group of countries that managed to achieve this target includes Sweden, Finland, Slovenia, and Austria. The x7 indicator is strongly associated with low levels of income in combination with high expenditure on energy and poor building efficiency standards. Starting from 2012, access to affordable energy for all European Union countries systematically improved until 2019, just before the outbreak of the pandemic. Countries of Northern Europe and most of those in Western Europe had the lowest shares of people without affordable access to heating, in contrast to countries of Southern and South-Eastern Europe, which suffered from the lack of adequate heating. This was mainly due to the poor energy efficiency of buildings, the lack of adequate heating systems and insulation, which caused higher heating costs. In addition, the generally lower income levels in these regions affect housing standards and the ability to pay for fuel [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref008">8</a>].</p>
<p>In the case of the x5 indicator (Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption), related to energy supply, the target for 2030 (40%) was achieved by Sweden, Finland, and Latvia. In 2021 the share of renewable energy sources (RES) in gross final energy consumption was equal to 62.6% in Sweden, 43.1% in Finland and 42.1% in Latvia. Such results were achieved by relying on hydropower and solid biofuels, which are regarded as more environmentally friendly compared to conventional energy sources. In general, the use of renewable energy in the EU can be said to be steadily growing. This growth is largely due to the use of wind and solar energy. However, the variation in the share of renewables across Member States is still very large. This can be attributed, among other things, to differences in the availability of RES as well as the degree of available financial and regulatory support. Compared to 2005, the share of renewable energy sources in 2021 more than doubled, from 10.2% to 21.8% of gross final energy consumption. This increase was driven by reductions in investment costs, the use of more efficient technologies, supply chain improvements and support schemes for renewables [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref007">7</a>]. It is worth noting that the 9.5% increase in the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption in 2019–2021 is also the result of a decline in final energy consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic, which means that this change was temporary. Once final energy consumption returns to pre-pandemic levels, the share of RES in gross final energy consumption will most likely fall [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref005">5</a>].</p>
<p>The 2030 target for the x6 indicator (Energy import dependency), which is related to energy supply, was achieved in 2021 by Sweden and Estonia. In 2020, all EU countries were net importers of energy, with 16 importing more than half of their total energy consumption from other countries (EU and non-EU countries). Compared to 2005, fuel imports from non-EU countries slightly decreased from 57.8% to 57.5% of gross available energy. In 2020, the main non-EU energy suppliers included Russia (43.6% of gas, 28.9% of petroleum products and 53.7% of solid fuel imports), Norway and the United Kingdom (25.4% of gas imports and 16.5% of oil imports), North America (18.8% of solid fuel imports). Imports of fossil fuels still cover more than half of the EU’s energy demand despite the continuous growth of renewable energy sources. The stagnation is due to two factors. First, the EU has reduced energy consumption and increased the use of domestic renewables. Second, primary production of fossil fuels has declined due to the depletion or uneconomical exploitation of domestic sources, especially in the case of natural gas [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref005">5</a>].</p>
<p>In 2021, Spain, Malta and Portugal achieved the 2030 target for the x3 indicator (final energy consumption in households per capita), which is related to energy consumption. Households account for about a quarter of final energy consumption. From 2010 to 2015, household energy consumption in EU countries decreased by 12.7%, and remained at more or less the same level for the next five years: in 2020, it was only about 0.5% higher than in 2015. It was not until 2021, that the indicator had increased by 5.6% compared to 2020. Thanks to improvements in energy efficiency, particularly in space heating, it was possible to balance the population growth and increases in the number and size of dwellings [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref005">5</a>]. In the period from 2010 to 2021, energy consumption per capita in the EU decreased by 7.3%. This decline was accompanied by a slight downward trend in total household energy consumption offsetting a 1.3% increase in the population (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/demo_gind/default/table?lang=en">https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/demo_gind/default/table?lang=en</a>).</p>
<p>In 2021, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg achieved the 2030 target for the x4 indicator (energy productivity), related to energy consumption. Since 2000, the EU continuously increased its energy productivity, reaching EUR 8.55 per kilograms of oil equivalent (kgoe) in 2021. All Member States contributed to this positive trend in an attempt to reach the 2030 target of 10.44 per kgoe.</p>
<p>As regards the last two indicators, x1 (primary energy consumption) and x2 (final energy consumption), related to energy consumption, in 2021 the target set for 2030 was only achieved by Greece. From 2005, primary and final energy consumption in the EU was generally on a downward trend, which was due to various factors, including a structural shift towards less energy-intensive industries and improvements in end-use efficiency in the residential sector. Measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic and the related restrictions on public life and economic activity resulted in a significant decrease in energy consumption by over 8% in 2020 compared to 2019. Other factors that in the long term contribute to falling energy consumption include improvements in energy efficiency and the growing use of energy from renewable sources. Despite the fact that effects of the pandemic can still be felt in the economy, the recovery observed in 2021 certainly led to higher energy consumption, preventing EU countries from achieving the 2030 target. Therefore, innovation and additional improvements in energy efficiency are still required.</p>

<div id="section2"><h3>1.2. The purpose of the article</h3>
<p>Both the European Union as a whole and each of its member states analysed in the study vary in their progress on SDG 7. To adequately describe this problem, it is necessary to use different research approaches. This is also confirmed by the existing literature. Three methodological approaches can be distinguished in this regard:</p>


<ol>

<li>The aggregate measure approach, in which one measures the overall progress on all indicators achieved by individual countries. This approach can be used to create a ranking of countries according to the value of the aggregate measure of all indicators (diagnostic features) representing progress on SDG 7. Because this approach does not take into account the target values these indicators should achieve by 2030, it cannot be used to determine the distance of individual EU countries in relation to targets set for 2030. This approach is applied, among others, by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref009">9</a>–<a href="#pone.0297856.ref013">13</a>].</li>

<li>The aggregate measure approach which takes into account the target values for the indicators (see <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a>) without adjusting the data. National values of individual indicators are related to their target values. This approach can also be used to create a ranking of countries according to the value of the aggregate measure of all indicators (diagnostic features) representing progress on SDG 7. In addition, it is also possible to calculate how far individual EU countries are from achieving the goals set for 2030 (EU-level targets for 2030). This kind of approach was presented, for example, in the work by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref003">3</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref014">14</a>].</li>

<li>The aggregate measure approach which takes into account the target values for the indicators (see <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a>) with adjusted data. In addition to assessing progress on SDG 7 achieved by individual EU countries and their distance in relation to the goals set for 2030, the approach relies on data corrected as follows: when a given country exceeds targets shown in <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a> (EU-level targets for 2030), these higher national values for stimulants and lower national values for destimulants are not included in the analysis but are replaced by target values set for the entire European Union. This approach was presented, for example, in the work by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref015">15</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref016">16</a>] to assess the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy.</li>

</ol><p>The purpose of the following study is to assess progress made by individual EU countries in 2010–2021 towards achieving SDG 7 and to determine their distance in relation to targets set for 2030. To overcome the problems with the first and second approach, we propose an innovative third approach, which accounts for the target values of the indicators and uses adjusted data. This approach has not been used in this type of research so far and the use of the geometric mean in the dynamic relative taxonomy method has made it possible to reduce the impact of the negative compensation effect on the values of aggregate measures. The results of the study have important implications for individual EU countries. In addition to showing progress towards the SDG 7 target, they also represent the distance that separates each country from achieving the 2030 target. The proposed methodology can also be used to assess progress made by EU countries in the implementation of other SDGs of the 2030 Agenda.</p>
<p>Composite indicators play an important role in the analysis of socio-economic phenomena. A number of different approaches to constructing composite indicators have been proposed in the literature [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref017">17</a>, p. 3] depending on the degree of compensation: compensatory, partially compensatory, and non-compensatory. Studies on multi-criteria decision-making uses of non-compensatory methods, see [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref018">18</a>–<a href="#pone.0297856.ref020">20</a>]. An overview of compensatory and partially compensatory aggregate measures applied to different types of data can be found in [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref021">21</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref022">22</a>].</p>
<p>Under the aggregate measure approach, positive and negative deviations from the target values of individual indicators can accumulate. As a result, countries which have exceeded targets for some indicators but have failed to achieve those set for the majority of other indicators can be classified as countries that have made much progress on SDG 7. In other words, the main weakness of methods based on aggregate measures is their compensatory nature, which is most strongly manifested in the first and the second approach.</p>
<p>In order to limit the impact of this compensation effect on the ranking of EU countries, the following were included in the methodology of relative taxonomy (see section 3):</p>


<ul>

<li>the third aggregate measure approach which takes into account the 2030 target values for the indicators (see <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a>) with data adjustment,</li>

<li>in step 6 and 7 of the procedure, the geometric mean was used in the construction of the aggregate measure.</li>

</ul></div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section2"><h2>2. Literature review</h2><p>In recent years, energy security has become a basic element of the economic security system. Recent events have clearly shown that energy policy and its monitoring play a key role in ensuring stable economic development [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref023">23</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref024">24</a>]. Without an energy policy, it is difficult to guarantee the security of energy supply to households and other consumers from all economic sectors. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out by the UN in 2015 are particularly relevant in the present political and economic context [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref001">1</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref025">25</a>]. The 17 goals, including 169 targets, indicate global priorities which comprehensively define sustainable development in terms of economic, environmental, and social aspects [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref026">26</a>]. SDGs are a revised version of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) formulated for the period 2000–2015. The operational period of the MDGs revealed that these goals did not focus enough on some issues related to sustainable development, such as energy [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref027">27</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref028">28</a>]. Although access to sustainable energy services is one of the fundamental conditions for sustainable development, energy was only included as a key theme in Agenda 2030 [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref001">1</a>].</p>
<p>SDG 7 is to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all”. This goal includes five targets to be achieved by 2030 (see section 1.1; [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref029">29</a>]) and is closely related to the targets of eight other goals. Many studies on the quality of interlinkages between SDGs have confirmed that the pursuit of certain targets generates effects that have an impact on other targets [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref025">25</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref030">30</a>]. Researchers highlighted positive and negative effects [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref031">31</a>–<a href="#pone.0297856.ref033">33</a>]. A number of studies have been undertaken to identify correlations and map relationships between the SDGs [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref028">28</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref034">34</a>–<a href="#pone.0297856.ref040">40</a>]. Some have focused only on a specific target area such as energy, water or food and explored its links with other SDGs [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref041">41</a>–<a href="#pone.0297856.ref043">43</a>]. SDG 7 has been found to be very strongly correlated with SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).</p>
<p>While studies on interlinkages between SDGs are helpful in evaluation processes, they do not provide complete information on whether, and to what extent, the SDGs are actually achieved. To maximize progress on SDGs, it is necessary to assess the importance of the individual goals by identifying problems and barriers to achieving them and areas that require attention in the future [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref044">44</a>]. Undoubtedly, one of the key questions that needs to be answered is how to measure countries’ performance and evaluate their actions aimed at achieving SDGs. One of the priorities indicated by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref045">45</a>] for how the scientific community should participate in this process was to design a way for tracking and assessing progress on each SDG. Given the wide scope of the 17 goals, different scales (national, regional, global), multi-issue coverage and ambiguous language, such assessment requires appropriately adjusted statistical tools [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref010">10</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref046">46</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref047">47</a>]. Even at the level of each country, the position in a particular hierarchy is often relative and depends on initial assumptions, the selected method, indicators used to create the ranking. Additionally, some goals (e.g., SDG 7) are more sensitive to methodological choices than others (e.g., SDG 16) [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref014">14</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref048">48</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref049">49</a>].</p>
<p>Although the measurement of progress on the SDGs has been the topic of debate among researchers since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, the literature concerning possible approaches is still limited [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref014">14</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref046">46</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref047">47</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref050">50</a>]. Since the SDGs and targets cannot be measured directly, they have been mostly operationalized by a number of indicators [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref051">51</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref052">52</a>]. 231 indicators were defined by the UN Statistical Commission to monitor and assess global sustainability [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref053">53</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref054">54</a>]. The set of SDG indicators defined by the EU comprises around 100 indicators. 31 indicators are used to monitor more than one goal. The indicators have been selected to take into account the EU context and perspective, availability, country coverage, data freshness and quality [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref005">5</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref055">55</a>].</p>
<p>Some authors have proposed approaches focusing on individual indicators. For example, [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref056">56</a>] conducted a detailed assessment of the indicator 6.4.2 (i.e., Level of water stress). Firoiu et al. [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref057">57</a>] used methods of dynamic analysis and prediction tools to assess progress on the SDGs achieved by Romania. Bidarbakhtnia [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref058">58</a>] analysed three methods used by, respectively, OECD, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP). All of them measure the distance of each indicator from the 2030 target. The study conducted by UNESCAP also shows progress on each indicator since 2000 in proportion to total progress needed for the region to reach the 2030 target. Giupponi et al. [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref059">59</a>] presented an approach for the spatial assessment of Water Use Efficiency (SDG indicator 6.4.1). Moyer and Hedden [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref060">60</a>] used an integrated assessment model to evaluate progress toward target values on nine indicators related to six SDGs related to human development.</p>
<p>The use of individual indicators without an accurate and scientific follow up on their operationalization is difficult because of comparability issues, reporting requirements and decision-making processes [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref061">61</a>–<a href="#pone.0297856.ref063">63</a>]. Since there are studies indicating that relying exclusively on the global set of individual indicators leads to questionable results, some researchers argue that progress on SDGs should be additionally measured by means of composite indicators (e.g. [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref052">52</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref064">64</a>]. It is worth adding that in the case of many indicators, it is difficult to conduct analysis and evaluate the results for a large number of countries without taking into account some form of index aggregation even if a synthetic measure is hard to construct and causes some loss of information. Despite limitations, the literature describes some methods to assess progress on the SDGs, which involve composite indices and aggregated dashboards. Schmidt-Traub et al. [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref065">65</a>] introduced the SDG Index, which synthesizes country-level data for all 17 SDGs taking into account the upper and lower bounds based on best and worst performing countries. The SDG Index can be used to estimate the distance that separates each country from achieving the SDGs. This approach is further developed in the article by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref050">50</a>], who propose a novel approach combining well-known methods to produce a comprehensive assessment of Australia’s progress on all SDGs. An attempt to use a composite indicator called ‘SDG achievement index’ (SDG-AI) to measure the SDGs, covering six dimensions of sustainable development (Health, Education, Services, Employment, Equality and Environment) can be found in [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref066">66</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref067">67</a>]. The SDG-AI can be used in two ways: to highlight differences between countries and to evaluate the contribution of different dimensions to the final result. Dhaoui [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref066">66</a>] assessed progress on SDGs in MENA (Middle East and North Africa) countries. Rocchi et al. [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref067">67</a>] modified the approach proposed by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref066">66</a>] to make it suitable for the EU context. A methodology for assessing SDGs on the aggregate level without losing information on single goals was proposed by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref068">68</a>]. Their study proposes several composite indices to assess the performance of EU member states. The two-stage approach involving Principal Component Analysis was applied to construct goal-based indices, pillar-based indices, and the overall SDG index. The indices were used to determine where a country currently stands on each of the indicators considered in the analysis, but they cannot be used to estimate the rate at which a country is moving towards achieving the SDGs.</p>
<p>Miola and Schiltz [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref014">14</a>] compared three main approaches to measuring progress on SDGs at country level: the SDG Index, the OECD’s distance measure, and progress measures based on Eurostat’s report. They identified crucial weaknesses in these existing methods and their sensitivity to particular choices made along the way: depending on which indicators and approaches are applied, countries can receive substantially different relative evaluations. The authors identify the main methodological challenges that should be addressed when developing analytical tools to evaluate progress on SDGs.</p>
<p>Cavalli et al. [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref069">69</a>] propose a model-based approach to evaluating the sustainability of the EU regional operational programme (ROP) in terms of SDGs, which is based on a synthetic sustainability index representing the part of ROP resources that contribute to the 2030 Agenda in relation to the total ROP resources. The usefulness of composite indicators has been demonstrated by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref010">10</a>], who compared the utility of the Multiple Reference Point Weak-Strong Composite Indicators (MRP-WSCI) and its partially compensatory version (MRP-PCI) for assessing the sustainability of EU countries according to the framework of the 2030 Agenda. The approach was used to produce composite indicators with different degrees of compensation, which constituted the basis for a country ranking.</p>
<p>Different variants of the methodology have already been used to build composite sustainability indicators in relation to SDG 7. Vavrek and Chovancová [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref013">13</a>] assessed EU countries using a set of eight energy-related indicators. Indicator weights were determined using the coefficient of variation from the TOPSIS method. The authors assessed whether a country’s performance resulted from a single indicator regarded as typical for the positively or negatively evaluated countries, or from a combination of indicators reflecting general energy issues. Chovancová and Vavrek [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref011">11</a>] presented a continuation of their research, in which they identified the best and the worst performing EU countries taking into account a set of indicators.</p>
<p>Cheba and Bąk [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref012">12</a>] proposed a synthetic measure based on the TOPSIS method to evaluate the relationship between SDG 7 and environmental production efficiency, which is a key component of the idea of green growth. They found considerable discrepancies between development paths of different EU countries despite their efforts to equalize the level of development in this area.</p>
<p>Dmytrów et al. [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref009">9</a>] proposed an approach to assessing the EU’s progress on SDG 7 at the national level using a synthetic measure obtained by applying the method of complex proportional assessment (COPRAS). They produced a ranking of countries in terms of their progress on SDG 7 by applying the Dynamic Time Warping method. Hierarchical clustering was then used to determine homogeneous groups of countries.</p>
<p>The rate of progress on SDG 7 achieved by the EU countries was also analysed by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref049">49</a>], who applied hierarchical cluster analysis to identify hidden associative structures. They also ranked EU countries in relation to the goals of the 2030 and 2050 Agenda. The ranking was used to identify clusters of countries sharing similar characteristics regarding their performance on SDG 7. Cluster analysis was also used by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref070">70</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref071">71</a>] to assess energy-related indicators of SDGs. In both studies, countries’ performance was analysed and compared taking into account their own conditions and progress on SDG 7 and energy transformation processes taking place in EU member states.</p>
<p>While the importance of assessing progress towards achieving sustainable development goals is recognized, the number of articles proposing new methods, especially those representing a dynamic approach, is still rather limited. In the case of the SDGs, given the large number of indicators, it is reasonable to opt for composite indicators [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref010">10</a>]. Composite indicators are associated with different degrees of compensation. One can distinguish fully compensatory, partially compensatory, or non-compensatory indicators (see section 1.2). The recommended approach is to assess sustainability in relation to a threshold or a target [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref010">10</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref072">72</a>]. According to [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref073">73</a>], ‘a given indicator does not say anything about sustainability, unless a reference value such as thresholds is given to it’. Non-compensatory methods can be used to identify weak points in the global assessment of an object and thus possible areas for improvement. For these reasons, we propose a novel non-compensatory approach based on principles of dynamic relative taxonomy applied to the procedure of constructing an aggregate measure. It can account for reference levels of each indicator and be used to rank countries accordingly showing the varying distance that separates individual EU countries from the targets set out in Agenda 2030. An additional advantage of this method is that the dynamic approach indicates not only relations between the objects in specific periods, but also changes in the phenomenon of interest that took place between objects over the entire reference period. Thus, it can be used to track cross-sectional and longitudinal changes.</p>

<div id="section1"><h3>3. Using dynamic relative taxonomy to construct a composite index</h3>
<p>The classic approach to relative taxonomy was proposed by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref074">74</a>]. Lira [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref075">75</a>] developed its positional version. Both approaches are static which means that relativization given by formula (<a href="#pone.0297856.e005">5</a>) is conducted separately for each single year of period analysed in the study. Static relative taxonomy has been applied, among others, by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref076">76</a>–<a href="#pone.0297856.ref078">78</a>].</p>
<p>The following study involves the use of dynamic relative taxonomy, described in [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref021">21</a>]. In the dynamic version, values of the <em>j</em>-th variable in formula (<a href="#pone.0297856.e005">5</a>) is relativised based on a matrix of data from all periods. This approach was extended by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref022">22</a>] to include robust measures of central tendency. Geometric mean was used in steps 6 and 7 of the dynamic relative taxonomy procedure (c.f. [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref016">16</a>]):</p>


<ol>

<li>Observations of <em>m</em> variables for <em>n</em> objects and <em>T</em> + 1 periods (2010–2021 and the year 2030, for which target values are set) are combined into one data matrix:
<a name="pone.0297856.e001" id="pone.0297856.e001"></a><span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297856.e001" loading="lazy"><span>(1)</span></span>
where: <em>i</em> = 1, …, <em>n</em>—object number (<em>n</em> = 28: the EU as a whole and 27 EU countries),<br><em>j</em> = 1, …, <em>m</em>—variable number (<em>m</em> = 7: indicators for SDG 7 –see <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a>),<br><em>t</em> = 1, …, <em>T</em>, <em>T</em>*—where <em>t</em> = 1, …, <em>T</em> represents years 2010–2021, and <em>t</em> = <em>T</em>* the year 2030, for which target values are set–see <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a>.</li>

<li>Stimulants and destimulants are identified in the set of variables (both terms were introduced by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref079">79</a>]). Instead of describing variables as stimulants and destimulants, [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref080">80</a>] use the terms ‘positive polarity’ (increasing values of the index correspond to an improvement in the phenomenon of interest) and ‘negative polarity’ (increasing values of the index correspond to a deterioration in the phenomenon of interest). Hwang and Yoon [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref081">81</a>, p. 130] use the concepts of ‘benefit’ (larger values of a variable are preferred) and ‘cost’ (larger values of a variable are less preferred).</li>

<li>Observations on each variable are replaced with target values if the following conditions are satisfied (data adjustment):
<a name="pone.0297856.e002" id="pone.0297856.e002"></a><span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297856.e002" loading="lazy"><span>(2)</span></span>
<a name="pone.0297856.e003" id="pone.0297856.e003"></a><span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297856.e003" loading="lazy"><span>(3)</span></span>
<em>y</em><sub><em>ijT</em>*</sub>—target values of SDG 7 indicators set for 2030.<br>For each variable, values higher (for stimulants) or lower (for destimulants) than the targets are replaced with the values of EU-level targets (target values of SDG 7 indicators set for 2030). This operation can be called one-sided Winsorization of the data (see e.g., [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref082">82</a>]).</li>

<li>Destimulants <em>D</em> are converted into stimulants using the ratio transformation:
<a name="pone.0297856.e004" id="pone.0297856.e004"></a><span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297856.e004" loading="lazy"><span>(4)</span></span></li>

<li>Values of each <em>j</em>-th variable are relativized according to the following <em>n</em> ∙ <em>T</em>* × <em>n</em> ∙ <em>T</em>* matrix:
<a name="pone.0297856.e005" id="pone.0297856.e005"></a><span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297856.e005" loading="lazy"><span>(5)</span></span>
As a result of relativization, variable values are dimensionless. When the numerator is not greater than the denominator, the relativization formula produces values included in the interval (0; 1], otherwise, values are included in the interval (1; ∞).</li>

<li>The average similarity of a given relativized observation with respect to other relativized observations of the <em>j</em>-th variable for each column of matrix (<a href="#pone.0297856.e005">5</a>) is calculated using the geometric mean:
<a name="pone.0297856.e006" id="pone.0297856.e006"></a><span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297856.e006" loading="lazy"><span>(6)</span></span>
The [<em>z</em><sub><em>ijt</em></sub>] matrix is equivalent to a normalised matrix in multivariate statistical analysis.</li>

<li>Values of the composite indicator <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> are calculated according to the following formula:
<a name="pone.0297856.e007" id="pone.0297856.e007"></a><span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297856.e007" loading="lazy"><span>(7)</span></span>
Values of the composite indicator <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> given by (<a href="#pone.0297856.e007">7</a>) can be greater or smaller than 1. The smaller the value of <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> is, the better the position of object <em>i</em> relative to other objects in a time interval from <em>t</em> = 1 to <em>t</em> = <em>T</em>*. Unlike the static approach, the dynamic approach shows not only relations between the objects in specific periods, but also changes in the phenomenon of interest that took place between objects over the entire reference period.</li>

</ol><p>The method of dynamic relative taxonomy is characterised by the following properties:</p>


<ul>

<li>it can only be used for variables measured on the ratio scale (their values are positive real numbers). In other words, it cannot be applied to interval-valued data. This is not a serious limitation since the majority of variables describing economic phenomena are measured on the ratio scale;</li>

<li>composite indicators <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> do not have an upper bound, which does not disqualify them as such;</li>

<li>the data matric can have missing values (<em>NA</em>), which are excluded in the calculation of the composite indicators <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub>;</li>

<li>the disadvantage of the static approach when calculating the average similarity of a given relativized observation in relation to other relativized observations has been eliminated (more details can be found in [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref021">21</a>].</li>

</ul></div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section3"><h2>4. Results in relation to EU-level targets for 2030</h2><p>In the first step we analysed changes in <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> representing progress on SDG 7 in the EU countries. <a href="#pone-0297856-t003">Table 3</a> shows values of <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> representing progress on SDG 7 achieved by EU countries in 2010–2021. The lower the value of <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub>, the better the position of object <em>i</em> relative to other objects in each year and over the entire reference period. The dynamic approach reveals not only relationships between objects in different years but also changes that took place in the level of a given indicator over the entire reference period.</p>
<p>The last three columns in <a href="#pone-0297856-t003">Table 3</a> show, respectively, the increment in the composite indicator between 2030 and 2010 (Δ = <em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2030</sub> − <em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub>), the increment in the composite indicator between 2021and 2010 (Δ1 = <em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2021</sub> − <em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub>) and the distance of each EU country in relation to the target set for 2030 (Δ2 = <em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2030</sub> − <em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2021</sub>).</p>
<p>Countries furthest away from the target at the start of the reference period included Malta (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 2.04), Cyprus (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 1.59), Bulgaria (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 1.52), Belgium (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 1.40), Lithuania (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 1.36), Poland (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 1.36). Countries that were closest to the targets in 2010 included three Scandinavian–Denmark (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 0.77), Sweden (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 0.80), Finland (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 0.92) and Austria (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 0.94). Between 2010 and 2021 values of <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> fell on average by nearly 2% each year, which means that the distance of all countries from the targets kept decreasing. The biggest average annual change (decline) during the reference period was observed for Malta (4.5%), Latvia (2.8%), Cyprus (2.7%) and Ireland (2.6%). The smallest average annual change (decline) throughout the reference period was observed for Denmark (0.4%), Finland (1.1%) and Sweden (1.5%).</p>
<p>The distance of the European Union as a whole in 2021 in relation to the target set for 2030 is Δ1 = –0.4207. Fourteen EU countries were closer to the target in 2021 (see <a href="#pone-0297856-g001">Fig 1</a>). Because of changes in the values of the seven indicators that took place over 11 years, the group of countries that came closest to the 2030 target in 2021, apart from the three Scandinavian countries, includes Estonia, Austria, and Slovenia. Despite big increases in the values of the composite indicator, the largest distance in relation to the SDG 7 target in 2021 can be observed for Bulgaria, Lithuania, Malta, and Cyprus.</p>

<p>The biggest progress (improvement in the value of <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> between 2010 and 2021) on SDG 7 in the period 2010–2021 was made by Malta (Δ1 = −0.8165), followed by Cyprus (Δ1 = –0.4156), Latvia (Δ1 = –0.3338), Belgium (Δ1 = – 0.3289), Ireland (Δ1 = –0.3259) and Poland (Δ1 = –0.3211). The European Union as a whole is making progress towards meeting the SDG 7 goal. The improvement in the value of the aggregate measurer <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> in the period 2010–2021 was Δ1 = −0.1878. In the Eurostat report [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref084">84</a>], progress towards the SDG 7 goal was described as moderately favorable.</p>

Because of small improvement in the value of the composite indicator for Spain (Δ1 = −0.0492), Romania (Δ1 = −0.0866) and Slovakia (Δ1 = −0.0941), they fell in the ranking, respectively, by 12 places (from 7th to 19th), by 7 places (from 9th to 16th) and by 8 places (from 14th to 22nd).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that in 2021 as many as 12 countries represent a similar, average level of the composite indicator, ranging from 0.898 (Netherlands) to 0.993 (Spain). The degree of variation between the smallest and the biggest values is considerably greater.</p>
<p><a href="#pone-0297856-g002">Fig 2</a> includes a line graph showing progress on SDG 7 achieved by the 28 objects (the EU and the 27 EU countries) between 2010 and 2021.</p>
<p>The reference period includes the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, which evidently affected deterioration on SDG 7 achieved by Sweden, Denmark, and Germany in 2020 in relation to the performance observed in 2019. A similar deterioration in performance can be observed in 2021 in relation to 2020 in the case of 16 countries (Austria, Finland, Netherlands, France, Czech Republic, Croatia, Ireland, Romania, Italy, Spain, Poland, Slovakia, Belgium, Hungary, Lithuania, Bulgaria). No negative effects during the pandemic can be observed for the remaining 8 countries.</p>
<p>The horizontal line at the bottom of the chart represents the EU-level target for 2030: <em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2030</sub> = 0.5486. A systematic decrease both the average value of the aggregate measure and its diversification can be observed in the entire period under study (see <a href="#pone-0297856-t003">Table 3</a>, <a href="#pone-0297856-g002">Fig 2</a>). First of all, this indicates systematic progress on SDG 7 achieved by the EU countries. Secondly, it shows that differences between EU countries keep getting smaller, as evidenced by the range and the standard deviations of the composite indicator (see <a href="#pone-0297856-t003">Table 3</a>). The range of the composite indicator decreased from <span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297856.e008" loading="lazy"></span> in 2010 to <span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297856.e009" loading="lazy"></span> in 2021.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section4"><h2>5. Conclusions and policy implications</h2><p>Since September 2015, 193 UN countries have been working to implement the resolution “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” containing 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To ensure sustainable performance in the context of the challenges posed by the 2030 Agenda, each EU country needs to properly assess its progress towards achieving SDGs. Given the importance of this need, we set out to analyse the performance of the EU countries in relation to the core targets covered by SDG 7, measuring progress by using seven indicators. For three of these indicators the European Commission has set target values for 2030. For the other four, the target values were based on the “best performance” among the EU countries in 2015.</p>
<p>Progress on SDGs is typically measured by means of composite indicators. Three methodological approaches can be distinguished depending on the degree of compensation: fully compensatory, partially compensatory, and non-compensatory. The third approach is recommended since in addition to accounting for target values of the indicators, it involves data adjustment and can be used to identify weak points in the country’s global assessment, and, consequently, indicate possible areas for improvement (see section 1.2). Because the main goal of the study was to assess progress on SDG 7 achieved by individual EU countries and to determine their distance in relation to the target set for 2030, we decided to use a multidimensional indicator proposed and constructed by applying dynamic relative taxonomy (section 3). The method used in the analysis represents a non-compensatory approach.</p>
<p>During the reference period (2010–2021), all EU countries made systematic progress towards achieving SDG 7, although to a different degree and at different rate. Looking at how many countries managed to achieve the EU targets for 2030, the best result can be observed for the x7 indicator (Share of population unable to keep home adequately warm), which was achieved by Sweden, Finland, Slovenia, Austria; followed by the x5 indicator (Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption)–achieved by Sweden, Finland, Latvia; the x4 indicator (Energy productivity)–achieved by Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg; for the x3 indicator (Final energy consumption in households per capita)–achieved by Spain, Malta, Portugal; for the x6 indicator (Energy import dependency)–achieved by Sweden, Estonia. Greece was the only country to achieve the 2030 target level for the remaining two indicators, namely x1 (Primary energy consumption) and x2 (Final energy consumption).</p>
<p>In 2010, the distance from the 2030 target was the biggest for Malta, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Belgium, Lithuania, Poland, and the smallest for Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and Austria. Because of changes in the values of the seven indicators that took place over 11 years, the group of countries that came closest to the 2030 target in 2021, apart from the three Scandinavian countries, includes Estonia, Austria, and Slovenia. Despite big increases in the values of the composite indicator, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Malta, and Cyprus remained furthest away from the SDG 7 target in 2021.</p>
<p>The trend regarding the implementation of the 2030 Agenda has been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many EU countries experienced a slowdown in the progress towards SDGs. In the case of SDG 7, the distance from the 2030 target in 2020 compared to 2019 had increased for Sweden, Denmark, and Germany. A similar deterioration in performance can be observed from 2020 to 2021 in the case of 16 countries (Austria, Finland, Netherlands, France, Czechia, Croatia, Ireland, Romania, Italy, Spain, Poland, Slovakia, Belgium, Hungary, Lithuania, Bulgaria). It is worth emphasizing that during the pandemic, some improvement could be observed for certain indicators. Counter-pandemic measures helped to enhance energy efficiency, which is one of the key pillars in achieving SDG 7. The restrictions on public life and lower economic activity reduced energy consumption from 2019 to 2020 by more than 8%. The reduction in final energy consumption also resulted in greater energy supply and increased the share of renewables in gross final energy consumption. The economic recovery of 2021 and the return to pre-pandemic mobility patterns increased the demand for energy again. However, consumption remained below pre-pandemic levels as the effects of the pandemic continued to shape energy and economic activities. The most obvious negative consequence of the pandemic was the increase in energy consumption by EU households. Given these short-term trends, it is clear that in order to ensure the EU achieves its goals by 2030, changes in all indicators should be continuously monitored and assessed. The main motivation of our study was therefore to propose a methodological approach that could provide information to make such monitoring possible.</p>
<p>The novelty of the study consists in applying a non-compensatory approach to show the varying distance that separates individual EU countries from the targets set out in Agenda 2030. This was possible thanks to the use of the aggregate approach in the methodology of dynamic relative taxonomy (see section 3) taking into account the target values of the indicators for 2030 with data adjustment (one-sided Winsorization in step 3 –see section 1.2) and the use of the geometric mean in step 6 and 7 of the procedure of the aggregate measure constructing. It is worth noting that the dynamic approach indicates not only relations between the objects in specific periods, but also changes in the phenomenon of interest that took place between objects over the entire reference period. In other words, it can be used to tracking changes from a cross-sectional and longitudinal perspective.</p>
<p>The conducted study has also its limitations. It was not possible to use all SDG 7 indicators included in Agenda 2030 because required statistical data were not directly comparable (the first two indicators in <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a>), as explained in section 1.2. The key disadvantage of aggregate methods, i.e., their compensatory nature (the fact that positive and negative deviations from the target values of individual indicators can accumulate), was considerably reduced by utilising the geometric mean and by applying one-sided Winsorization of the data, according to formulas (<a href="#pone.0297856.e002">2</a>) and (<a href="#pone.0297856.e003">3</a>).</p>
<p>The results of the study contribute to research on energy security, which is currently an essential element of the economic security system. The proposed approach involving dynamic relative taxonomy can be used as a tool supporting efforts to monitor progress on SDG 7 as part of the national energy policy. It is worth emphasizing that progress achieved by particular countries can be more relevant than their final performance outcomes. In order to properly assess progress regarding the goals of Agenda 2030, in addition to calculating indices and creating country rankings for selected years, it is necessary to analyse changes over time using the dynamic approach.</p>
<p>By design, all 17 SDGs are an integrated set of global priorities and objectives but SDG 7, as well as SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 3 (Good health and well-being), SDG 14 (Life below water), are classified as being the most synergistic with other SDGSs. Therefore, the results presented in this article can be treated as a starting point for policy makers and other stakeholders interested in identifying the main directions of change, priorities, and strategies in national policies of sustainable development.</p>
<p>As demonstrated in the study, the proposed methodology can be used not only to assess progress on SDG 7 but it also provides a relevant contribution to research regarding methods of measuring national progress on the other SDGs included in Agenda 2030.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.webexhibits.org/calendars/calendar-roman.html">early Roman calendar</a> was determined by the cycles of the Moon and the cycles of the agricultural year. Looking at this calendar with modern eyes, you might feel a bit short-changed. There are only 10 months in it, starting in March in spring, and the tenth and final month of the year is what we now know as December. Six of those months had 30 days, and four had 31 days – <a href="https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-why-is-february-shorter-than-every-other-month-176915">giving a total of 304 days</a>. What about the rest?</p>
<p>"For the two months of the year when there's no work being done in the field, they're just not counted," says Parish. The Sun rises and falls but, according to the early Roman calendar, no day has officially passed. "Which is where the complications start to come in."</p>
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-why-is-february-shorter-than-every-other-month-176915">In 731BC, the second King of Rome, Numa Pompilius</a>, decided to improve the calendar by introducing extra months to cover that winter period. "Because what's the point in a calendar that only covers part of the year?" Parish says. Pompilius' answer was to add 51 days to the calendar, creating what we now call January and February. This extension brought the calendar year up to 355 days.</p>
<p>If 355 days seems like an odd number for Pompilius to aim for, that was on purpose. The number takes its reference from the lunar year (12 lunar months), <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/year#ref120292">which is 354 days long</a>. However, "because of Roman superstitions about even numbers, an additional day is added to make 355", says Parish.</p>
<p>In this rejig, the months were arranged in such a way that all had odd numbers of days, except for February, with 28. "Therefore it's considered unlucky and the time of social, cultural and political purification," says Parish. "So that's the point at which you try and wipe the slate clean."</p>
<p>It's good progress, says Parish, but it's still around 11 days out from the Solar year of 365-and-a-bit days. "Even with this souped-up calendar from Pompilius, it's very easy for the calendar to get out of synchronisation with the seasons."</p>
<p>By around 200BC things had got sufficiently bad that a near-total eclipse of the Sun was observed in Rome on what we would now consider to be 14 March, but is recorded as having taken place on 11 July.</p>
<p>Because the calendar had by this point gone "so catastrophically wrong", Parish says, the Emperor and priests in Rome resorted to inserting <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/mercedonius/">an additional "intercalary" month, Mercedonius</a>, on an ad-hoc basis to try to realign the calendar to the seasons.</p>
<p>This did not work out very well. There was a tendency to add Mercedonius when favoured public officials were in power, for instance, rather than strictly to align the calendar with the seasons.</p>
<p><a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html">The classical writer and historian Suetonius complained</a> that "the negligence of the pontiffs had long since so disordered [the calendar], through their privilege of adding months or days at pleasure, that the harvest festivals did not come in summer nor those of the vintage in the autumn".</p>
<p>Which brings us back to Julius Caesar. The year 46BC already had a Mercedonius planned, but Caesar's advisor <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100519106">Sosigenes, an astronomer from Alexandria</a>, on Egypt's Mediterranean coast, said Mercedonius wasn't going to be enough this time.</p>
<p>On Sosigenes' advice, Caesar added another two never-before-seen months to the year 46BC, one of 33 days and one 34, to bring the calendar in line with the Sun. The additions made the year the longest in history at 445 days long, with 15 months.</p>
<p>After 46BC, the two new months, Mercedonius and the practice of intercalary months as a whole were abandoned as, all being well, there would be no more need for them.</p>
<p>"So we're back to a calendar that looks a bit more like the one we recognise," says Parish. "Excellent! This is looking refreshingly familiar."</p></div><div id="future/article/20240227-how-julius-caesar-made-the-longest-year-in-history-and-brought-us-leap-years-p0hfd4dv"><picture><source media="(min-width:624px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1024x1280/p0hfd4dv.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:624px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1024x1280/p0hfd4dv.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:485px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/885x1280/p0hfd4dv.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:485px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/885x1280/p0hfd4dv.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:320px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0hfd4dv.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:320px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0hfd4dv.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Agricultural events and religious celebrations were closely tied in the Roman era – but hard to keep track of without a robust calendar (Credit: Getty Images)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0hfd4dv.jpg" alt="Agricultural events and religious celebrations were closely tied in the Roman era – but hard to keep track of without a robust calendar (Credit: Getty Images)" id=""></picture><div><p>Agricultural events and religious celebrations were closely tied in the Roman era – but hard to keep track of without a robust calendar (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div><p>Unfortunately, getting the calendar to line up with the Sun is one thing, but keeping it that way is another. The issue arises from the inconvenient fact that there aren't a nice round number of days (Earth rotations) in a year (Earth orbits of the Sun).</p>
<p>"That's where the whole problem starts," says Daniel Brown, an astronomer at Nottingham Trent University, UK. The number of Earth rotations on a trip round the Sun is <a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-the-science-behind-leap-years-and-how-they-work-54788">roughly 365.2421897</a>… "and on it goes".</p>
<p>That means Earth fits in <em>almost</em> an extra quarter-turn every time it does a full orbit of the Sun. So adding an extra day every four years – in February – would help fix the mismatch, Sosigenes calculated.</p>
<p>And it would have worked quite well, at least for a while, if there hadn't been the problem of the idiosyncratic way the Romans counted the years.</p>
<p>"They look at the years and they count, one, two, three, four," says Parish. "And then they start counting again at four – so they count four, five, six, seven. Then they start at seven – so seven, eight, nine, 10. So they're accidentally double-counting one of those years each time. It doesn't take long to realise that slippage is starting to occur."</p>
<p><a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/home.html">This was corrected in the reign of Augustus</a> and leap years happened every four years instead of every three, and then the Julian calendar was well on its way. "Julius Caesar is getting it almost bang on where the calendar needs to be," says Parish.</p>
<p>It might have been the only calendar needed for the job, if the Earth did in fact do a neat extra quarter-turn each year. But it's a little bit short – by about 11 minutes.</p>
<p>"That means slowly but surely we're still running out of sync," says Brown.</p></div><div id="future/article/20240227-how-julius-caesar-made-the-longest-year-in-history-and-brought-us-leap-years-p0hfd4v2"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0hfd4v2.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0hfd4v2.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0hfd4v2.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0hfd4v2.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0hfd4v2.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0hfd4v2.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0hfd4v2.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0hfd4v2.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Even a small difference between the calendar and the movements of the Earth around the Sun will lead to a growing discrepancy (Credit: Getty Images)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0hfd4v2.jpg" alt="Even a small difference between the calendar and the movements of the Earth around the Sun will lead to a growing discrepancy (Credit: Getty Images)" id=""></picture><div><p>Even a small difference between the calendar and the movements of the Earth around the Sun will lead to a growing discrepancy (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div><p>The solution came much later, <a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-the-science-behind-leap-years-and-how-they-work-54788">in 1582 when Pope Gregory made further tweaks</a>.</p>
<p>"That's what the Gregorian calendar reform then corrected for – noting this and adapting that calendar slightly more so, making sure that it is not only just every four years, but then every 100 years they make sure that they skip that rule," says Brown. "But then they noted that doesn't fully match – you've overcompensated. So every 400 years, you don't skip it."</p>
<p>That's why, for example, the year 2000 was a leap year: because it is divisible by both 100 and 400.</p>
<p>"That all sounds really neat and tidy," says Parish – but this is where politics starts to shape the course of time. "It's a calendar that's implemented by Papal decree and that actually doesn't have authority outside the Church and outside the auspices of the Bishop of Rome."</p>
<p>There were people who complained that the Pope effectively stole 10 or 11 days of their time by adjusting the calendar, says Parish. Nonetheless, over the centuries more and more countries adopt the Gregorian calendar. "But, gloriously, they don't all do it at the same time," says Parish. "So you've tidied up the calendar, but you've now got calendars in different countries that are running on very different models."</p>

<p>Because of this discrepancy, "you can have the most bizarre situation where a reply written in England to a letter that's arrived from Spain can look as though it was sent before the first letter from Spain arrived", says Parish. "Because England is running ahead of Spain on the calendar."</p>
<p>Once the Gregorian calendar was widely adopted and internationally synchronised, it had several millennia of accuracy built in. But it's still not perfect.</p>
<p>In fact, around the middle of the 56th Century, "somebody is going to scratch their head and say, 'Hang on a minute, it should be Monday, but it's actually looking like Tuesday'," says Parish. "I think that's probably a margin of error that we're going to end up accepting."</p>
<p>Until that Monday (or Tuesday), the Gregorian calendar has at least bought us a bit of time.</p>

        <div><p>Dear Open Collective Community,</p><p>It is with sad hearts that we have heard the news about Open Collective Foundation decision to dissolve, effective December 31. The full content of their announcement, which came as a surprise to us, can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1odj1zfwqZgIyGOeBhv5QZxYHn422VOMdo32i3T3CPps/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ref=blog.opencollective.com">here</a>, and they have also created <a href="https://docs.opencollective.foundation/?ref=blog.opencollective.com">an FAQ</a>. We are still grappling with the realities of this decision, which has sent subsequent shock waves through the Open Collective ecosystem and community.</p></div><p><strong>Clarification of entities</strong></p><p><a href="https://opencollective.com/opencollective?ref=blog.opencollective.com">Open Collective. Inc (OC)</a> is a for-profit entity. We are responsible for building the Open Collective Platform that <a href="https://opencollective.com/search?isHost=true&amp;ref=blog.opencollective.com">many fiscal hosts</a> use for their operations. </p><p>The founders of Open Collective also founded and supported the early development of several nonprofit organizations:</p><ul><li><a href="https://opencollective.com/foundation?ref=blog.opencollective.com">Open Collective Foundation</a> (OCF) a US-based 501(c)(3) fiscal host that hosts charitable projects, and which has chosen to dissolve.</li><li><a href="https://opencollective.com/opensource?ref=blog.opencollective.com">Open Source Collective</a> (OSC) a US-based 501(c)(6) fiscal host that only hosts open source software-related projects and which continues to operate in good health.</li><li><a href="https://opencollective.com/europe?ref=blog.opencollective.com">Open Collective Europe</a> (OCE) a European based organization with the ability to have 501(c)(3) equivalency in the US, hosting open source, solidarity, artistic, and cultural projects principally rooted in or connected to Europe and which continues to operate in good health.</li></ul><p>These entities all have similar names and share similar origins, having been started by the founders of Open Collective and incubated in the Open Collective ecosystem, but are <strong>independent nonprofits with their own &nbsp;budget, accounts, staff, board of directors, and mission. </strong>They each have a separate commercial relationship with Open Collective. </p><p>Over recent years the Open Collective ecosystem has experienced rapid growth. While the above four organizations have historically been close partners, as they have grown, they have also become more and more distinct from one another, and are completely separate in their functions, despite their similarities in name and branding. Thus, <strong>Open Collective Foundation has made this decision completely independently.</strong></p><p><strong>Open Collective’s understanding of the situation</strong></p><p>Over the course of the last year, OCF made us aware of increased technological needs, to which we have been responding with new features and other forms of support. It appears that, despite our shared efforts, OCF has not found a viable and sustainable path forward. The exact specifics of OCF’s decision to dissolve are not known to us. We have to trust that OCF had a good reason to do this, but still, we cannot help but be deeply saddened that this has happened. </p><p>Open Collective Foundation is one of the largest nonprofits using the Open Collective Platform, and as an organization, Open Collective will need to evolve in response to these changes, but first, we will do whatever we can to rectify the situation, as quickly as possible, for all OCF collectives that are affected. <strong>What is most important to us is the fate of Open Collective Foundation’s collectives. </strong>We will do everything we can as a platform and as a company to support their transition to whatever is next.</p><p><strong>Transitioning from OCF</strong></p><p>We are moving as quickly as we can to understand how we can support the many collectives that are hosted by OCF and the communities they serve. Per OCF’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1odj1zfwqZgIyGOeBhv5QZxYHn422VOMdo32i3T3CPps/edit?ref=blog.opencollective.com" rel="noreferrer">announcement</a>,<strong> </strong>all <strong>OCF</strong> collectives will need to either:</p><ul><li>spend down and close out their collectives</li><li>spend down and transfer their collectives to another fiscal sponsor, or</li><li>transfer their collective and funds to another charitable organization.</li></ul><p>To be clear, this <strong>only applies to collectives hosted by Open Collective Foundation.</strong> The majority of open source projects on the platform are hosted by a different organization, Open Source Collective, which is in good financial health.</p><p><strong>If you are hosted by OCF</strong>, here are some dates to be aware of:</p><p>• Last day to accept funds/receive donations: March 15, 2024<br>• Last day collectives can have employees: June 30, 2024<br>• Last day to spend or transfer funds: September 30, 2024</p><p>While there is no 1:1 replacement for Open Collective Foundation on the Open Collective platform, the following could be potential paths forward for OCF collectives:</p><ul><li><a href="https://opencollective.com/europe?ref=blog.opencollective.com">Open Collective Europe</a> is a European charity serving as the equivalent of a 501(c)(3) in the US. They support open-source, solidarity, artistic, and cultural projects principally rooted in or connected to Europe.

<p dir="auto"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You don't have to clone this repository to get started!</p>
<p dir="auto">MicroZig uses a monorepo architecture, but provides a lot of different packages. If you just want to get started, head over to <a href="https://downloads.microzig.tech/" rel="nofollow">downloads.microzig.tech</a> and download an example for the chip family you desire.</p>
<p dir="auto">We support several chip families like the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/" rel="nofollow">RP2 family by RaspberryPi Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html" rel="nofollow">STM32 by STMicroelectronics</a>, and many others.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unpack the example, and run <code>zig build</code> in the resulting example folder gives you <code>zig-out/firmware</code> which contains the resulting files.</p>
<p dir="auto">Right now, you gotta figure out how to flash the MCU yourself, but as people say: Google is your friend. But you can also ask for help <a href="https://discord.gg/ShUWykk38X" rel="nofollow">on our Discord server</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Developer experience is degraded right now, and not really good. Windows isn't really a supported dev target and you got to expect some friction. <a href="https://github.com/orgs/ZigEmbeddedGroup/projects/4">There's a project for improving DX, feel free to grab tasks from there!</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Please see the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/ZigEmbeddedGroup/projects/1/views/1">project page</a>, it’s used as a place to brainstorm and organize work in ZEG. There will be issues marked as good first issue or drafts for larger ideas that need scoping/breaking ground on.</p>

<p dir="auto">Right now, the developer experience is not optimal due to 0.11 not really supporting what we're doing at all.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to test your changes, you gotta to the following:</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Install required python packages, either systemwide or via a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow">virtual environment</a>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# systemwide:
[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ 

# using virtual environments:

[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ . .venv/bin/activate # on linux, macos
[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ . .venv/Scripts/activate # on windows
[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ pip3 install -r tools/requirements.txt
[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ "><pre># <span>systemwide:</span>
<span>[user@host] microzig-monorepo/</span> $ <span>pip install -r tools/requirements.txt</span>
<span>[user@host] microzig-monorepo/</span> $ 

# <span>using virtual environments:</span>
<span>[user@host] microzig-monorepo/</span> $ <span>python3 -m venv .venv</span>
<span>[user@host] microzig-monorepo/</span> $ <span><span>.</span> .venv/bin/activate <span><span>#</span> on linux, macos</span></span>

<span>[user@host] microzig-monorepo/</span> $ <span>pip3 install -r tools/requirements.txt</span>
<span>[user@host] microzig-monorepo/</span> $ </pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Create a deployment for local usage:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ python3 ./tools/bundle.py --debug

<span>validating packages...</span>
<span>loaded packages:</span>

<span>  * microzig-core</span>

<span>  * ...</span>
<span>resolving inner dependencies...</span>
<span>creating packages...</span>
<span>bundling microzig-build...</span>
<span>bundling microzig-core...</span>
<span>bundling microchip/avr...</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>[user@host] microzig-monorepo/</span> $ </pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This command yields output in <code>./microzig-deploy</code> that is meant to be fetched via <code>http://localhost:8080/</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Step 3:</strong> To serve the files on this port, you can start a pre-bundled web server:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ python3 ./tools/demo-server.py
..."><pre><span>[user@host] microzig-monorepo/</span> $ <span>python3 ./tools/demo-server.py</span>
<span>...</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This way, you spawn a local HTTP server that will serve <code>./microzig-deploy</code> on port 8080 on your machine, and you can then
start fetching packages from this.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now you can use curl to fetch the packages, or you can just create a local development project.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Create a local test environment</p>
<p dir="auto">This is basically done by unpacking an example from the <code>./microzig-deploy/examples</code> folder, and starting to test changes.
As the <code>build.zig.zon</code> has to be updated after running <code>./tools/bundle.py</code> again, there's a script that helps here:
<code>tools/patch-build-zon.py</code> can be used to patch/upgrade your development project inplace based on what it finds in <code>./microzig-deploy</code>:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>In 2019, a</span> government contractor and technologist named Mike Yeagley began making the rounds in Washington, DC. He had a blunt warning for anyone in the country’s national security establishment who would listen: The US government had a Grindr problem.</p><p>A popular <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/dating-apps/">dating and hookup app</a>, Grindr relied on the <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/gps/">GPS</a> capabilities of modern smartphones to connect potential partners in the same city, neighborhood, or even building. The app can show how far away a potential partner is in real time, down to the foot.</p><p>In its 10 years of operation, Grindr had amassed millions of users and become a central cog in gay culture around the globe.</p><p>But to Yeagley, Grindr was something else: one of the tens of thousands of carelessly designed mobile phone apps that leaked massive amounts of data into the opaque world of online <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/advertising/">advertisers</a>. That data, Yeagley knew, was easily accessible by anyone with a little technical know-how. So Yeagley—a technology consultant then in his late forties who had worked in and around government projects nearly his entire career—made a PowerPoint presentation and went out to demonstrate precisely how that data was a serious national security risk.</p><p>As he would explain in a succession of bland government conference rooms, Yeagley was able to access the geolocation data on Grindr users through a hidden but ubiquitous entry point: the digital advertising exchanges that serve up the little digital banner ads along the top of Grindr and nearly every other ad-supported mobile app and website. This was possible because of the way online ad space is sold, through near-instantaneous auctions in a process called real-time bidding. Those auctions were rife with surveillance potential. You know that ad that seems to follow you around the internet? It’s tracking you in more ways than one. In some cases, it’s making your precise location available in near-real time to both advertisers and people like Mike Yeagley, who specialized in obtaining unique data sets for government agencies.</p><p>Working with Grindr data, Yeagley began drawing geofences—creating virtual boundaries in geographical data sets—around buildings belonging to government agencies that do national security work. That allowed Yeagley to see what phones were in certain buildings at certain times, and where they went afterwards. He was looking for phones belonging to Grindr users who spent their daytime hours at government office buildings. If the device spent most workdays at the Pentagon, the FBI headquarters, or the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency building at Fort Belvoir, for example, there was a good chance its owner worked for one of those agencies. Then he started looking at the movement of those phones through the Grindr data. When they weren’t at their offices, where did they go? A small number of them had lingered at highway rest stops in the DC area at the same time and in proximity to other Grindr users—sometimes during the workday and sometimes while in transit between government facilities. For other Grindr users, he could infer where they lived, see where they traveled, even guess at whom they were dating.</p><p>Intelligence agencies have a long and unfortunate history of trying to root out LGBTQ Americans from their workforce, but this wasn’t Yeagley’s intent. He didn’t want anyone to get in trouble. No disciplinary actions were taken against any employee of the federal government based on Yeagley’s presentation. His aim was to show that buried in the seemingly innocuous technical data that comes off every cell phone in the world is a rich story—one that people might prefer to keep quiet. Or at the very least, not broadcast to the whole world. And that each of these intelligence and national security agencies had employees who were recklessly, if obliviously, broadcasting intimate details of their lives to anyone who knew where to look.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>As Yeagley showed, all that information was available for sale, for cheap. And it wasn’t just Grindr, but rather any app that had access to a user’s precise location—other dating apps, weather apps, games. Yeagley chose Grindr because it happened to generate a particularly rich set of data and its user base might be uniquely vulnerable. A Chinese company had obtained a majority stake in Grindr beginning in 2016—amping up fears among Yeagley and others in Washington that the data could be misused by a geopolitical foe. (Until 1995, gay men and women were banned from having security clearances owing in part to a belief among government counterintelligence agents that their identities might make them vulnerable to being leveraged by an adversary—a belief that persists today.)</p><p>But Yeagley’s point in these sessions wasn’t just to argue that advertising data presented a threat to the security of the United States and the privacy of its citizens. It was to demonstrate that these sources also presented an enormous opportunity in the right hands, used for the right purpose. When speaking to a bunch of intelligence agencies, there’s no way to get their attention quite like showing them a tool capable of revealing when their agents are visiting highway rest stops.</p><p><span>Mike Yeagley saw</span> both the promise and the pitfalls of advertising data because he’d played a key role in bringing advertising data into government in the first place. His 2019 road show was an attempt to spread awareness across the diverse and often siloed workforces in US intelligence. But by then, a few select corners of the intel world were already very familiar with his work, and were actively making use of it.</p><p>Yeagley had spent years working as a technology “scout”—looking for capabilities or data sets that existed in the private sector and helping to bring them into government. He’d helped pioneer a technique that some of its practitioners would jokingly come to call “ADINT”—a play on the intelligence community’s jargon for different sources of intelligence, like the SIGINT (signals intelligence) that became synonymous with the rise of codebreaking and tapped phone lines in the 20th century, and the OSINT (open source intelligence) of the internet era, of which ADINT was a form. More often, though, ADINT was known in government circles as adtech data.</p><p>Adtech uses the basic lifeblood of digital commerce—the trail of data that comes off nearly all mobile phones—to deliver valuable intelligence information. Edward Snowden’s 2013 leaks showed that, for a time, spy agencies could get data from digital advertisers by tapping fiber-optic cables or internet choke points. But in the post-Snowden world, more and more traffic like that was being encrypted; no longer could the National Security Agency pull data from advertisers by eavesdropping. So it was a revelation—especially given the public outcry over Snowden’s leaks—that agencies could just <em>buy</em> some of the data they needed straight from commercial entities. One technology consultant who works on projects for the US government explained it this way to me: “The advertising technology ecosystem is the largest information-gathering enterprise ever conceived by man. And it wasn’t built by the government.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Everyone who possesses an iPhone or Android phone has been given an “anonymized” advertising ID by Apple or Google. That number is used to track our real-world movement, our internet browsing behavior, the apps we put on our phone, and much more. Billions of dollars have been poured into this system by America’s largest corporations. Faced with a commercially available repository of data this rich and detailed, the world’s governments have increasingly opened up their wallets to buy up this information on everyone, rather than hacking it or getting it through secret court orders.</p><p>Here’s how it works. Imagine a woman named Marcela. She has a Google Pixel phone with the Weather Channel app installed. As she heads out the door to go on a jog, she sees overcast skies. So Marcela opens the app to check if the forecast calls for rain.</p><p>By clicking on the Weather Channel’s blue icon, Marcela triggers a frenzy of digital activity aimed at serving her a personalized ad. It begins with an entity called an advertising exchange, basically a massive marketplace where billions of mobile devices and computers notify a centralized server whenever they have an open ad space.</p><p>In less than the blink of an eye, the Weather Channel app shares a ream of data with this ad exchange, including the IP address of Marcela’s phone, the version of Android it's running, her carrier, plus an array of technical data about how the phone is configured, down to what resolution the screen resolution is set to. Most valuable of all, the app shares the precise GPS coordinates of Marcela’s phone and the pseudonymized advertising ID number that Google has assigned to her, called an AAID. (On Apple devices, it’s called an IDFA.)</p><p>To the layperson, an advertising ID is a string of gibberish, something like bdca712j-fb3c-33ad-2324-0794d394m912. To advertisers, it’s a gold mine. They know that bdca712j-fb3c-33ad-2324-0794d394m912 owns a Google Pixel device with the Nike Run Club app. They know that bdca712j-fb3c-33ad-2324-0794d394m912 often frequents Runnersworld.com. And they know that bdca712j-fb3c-33ad-2324-0794d394m912 has been lusting after a pair of new Vaporfly racing shoes. They know this because Nike, Runnersworld.com, and Google are all plugged into the same advertising ecosystem, all aimed at understanding what consumers are interested in.</p><p>Advertisers use that information as they shape and deploy their ads. Say both Nike and Brooks, another running shoe brand, are trying to reach female running aficionados in a certain income bracket or in certain zip codes. Based on the huge amounts of data they can pull from the ether, they might build an “audience”—essentially a huge list of ad IDs of customers known or suspected to be in the market for running shoes. Then in an instantaneous, automated, real-time auction, advertisers tell a digital ad exchange how much they’re willing to pay to reach those consumers every time they load an app or a web page.</p><p>There are some limits and safeguards on all this data. Technically, a user can reset their assigned advertising ID number (though few people do so—or even know they have one). And users do have some control over what they share, via their app settings. If consumers don’t allow the app they’re using to access GPS, the ad exchange can’t pull the phone’s GPS location, for example. (Or at least they aren’t supposed to. Not all apps follow the rules, and they are sometimes not properly vetted once they are in app stores.)</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Moreover, ad exchange bidding platforms do minimal due diligence on the hundreds or even thousands of entities that have a presence on their servers. So even the losing bidders still have access to all the consumer data that came off the phone during the bid request. An entire business model has been built on this: siphoning data off the real-time bidding networks, packaging it up, and reselling it to help businesses understand consumer behavior.</p><p>Geolocation is the single most valuable piece of commercial data to come off those devices. Understanding the movement of phones is now a multibillion-dollar industry. It can be used to deliver targeted advertising based on location for, say, a restaurant chain that wants to deliver targeted ads to people nearby. It can be used to measure consumer behavior and the effectiveness of advertising. How many people saw an ad and later visited a store? And the analytics can be used for planning and investment decisions. Where is the best location to put a new store? Will there be enough foot traffic to sustain such a business? Is the number of people visiting a certain retailer going up or down this month, and what does that mean for the retailer’s stock price?</p><p>But this kind of data is good for something else. It has remarkable surveillance potential. Why? Because what we do in the world with our devices cannot truly be anonymized. The fact that advertisers know Marcela as bdca712j-fb3c-33ad-2324-0794d394m912 as they’re watching her move around the online and offline worlds offers her almost no privacy protection. Taken together, her habits and routines are unique to her. Our real-world movement is highly specific and personal to all of us. For many years, I lived in a small 13-unit walk-up in Washington, DC. I was the only person waking up every morning at that address and going to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>’s offices. Even if I was just an anonymized number, my behavior was as unique as a fingerprint even in a sea of hundreds of millions of others. There was no way to anonymize my identity in a data set like geolocation. Where a phone spends most of its evenings is a good proxy for where its owner lives. Advertisers know this.</p><p>Governments know this too. And Yeagley was part of a team that would try to find out how they could exploit it.</p><p><span>In 2015, a</span> company called PlaceIQ hired Yeagley. PlaceIQ was an early mover in the location data market. Back in the mid-2000s, its founder, Duncan McCall, had participated in an overland driving race from London to Gambia across the land-mine-strewn Western Sahara. He had eschewed the usual practice of hiring an expensive Bedouin guide to help ensure safe passage through the area. Instead, he found online a GPS route that someone else had posted from a few days earlier on a message board. McCall was able to download the route, load it into his own GPS device, and follow the same safe path. On that drive through the Western Sahara, McCall recalled dreaming up the idea for what would become PlaceIQ to capture all of the geospatial data that consumers were emitting and generate insights. At first the company used data from the photo-sharing website Flickr, but eventually PlaceIQ started tapping mobile ad exchanges. It would be the start of a new business model—one that would prove highly successful.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Yeagley was hired after PlaceIQ got an investment from the CIA’s venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel. Just as it had poured money into numerous social media monitoring services, geospatial data had also attracted In-Q-Tel’s interest. The CIA was interested in software that could analyze and understand the geographic movement of people and things. It wanted to be able to decipher when, say, two people were trying to conceal that they were traveling together. The CIA had planned to use the software with its own proprietary data, but government agencies of all kinds eventually became interested in the kind of raw data that commercial entities like PlaceIQ had—it was available through a straightforward commercial transaction and came with fewer restrictions on use inside government than secret intercepts.</p><p>While working there, Yeagley realized that the data itself might be valuable to the government, too. PlaceIQ was fine selling software to the government but was not prepared to sell its data to the feds. So Yeagley approached a different company called PlanetRisk—one of the hundreds and hundreds of tiny startups with ties to the US government dotted around office parks in Northern Virginia. In theory, a government defense contractor offered a more secure environment than a civilian company like PlaceIQ to do the kind of work he had in mind.</p><p>PlanetRisk straddled the corporate world and the government contracting space—building products that were aimed at helping customers understand the relative dangers of various spots around the world. For example, a company that wanted to establish a store or an office somewhere in the world might turn to PlanetRisk to analyze data on crime, civil unrest, and extreme weather as they vary geographically.</p><p>PlanetRisk hired Yeagley in 2016 as vice president of global defense—essentially a sales and business development job. The aim was for him to develop his adtech technology inside the contractor, which might try to sell it to various government agencies. Yeagley brought with him some government funding from his relationships around town in the defense and intelligence research communities.</p><p>PlanetRisk’s earliest sales demo was about Syria: quantifying the crush of refugees flowing out of Syria after years of civil war and the advancing ISIS forces. From a commercial data broker called UberMedia, PlanetRisk had obtained location data on Aleppo—the besieged Syrian city that had been at the center of some of the fiercest fighting between government forces and US-backed rebels. It was an experiment in understanding what was possible. Could you even obtain location information on mobile phones in Syria? Surely a war zone was no hot spot for mobile advertising.</p><p>But to the company’s surprise, the answer was yes. There were 168,786 mobile devices present in the city of Aleppo in UberMedia’s data set, which measured mobile phone movements during the month of December 2015. And from that data, they could see the movement of refugees around the world.</p><p>The discovery that there was extensive data in Syria was a watershed. No longer was advertising merely a way to sell products; it was a way to peer into the habits and routines of billions. “Mobile devices are the lifeline for everyone, even refugees,” Yeagley said.</p><p>PlanetRisk had sampled data from a range of location brokers—Cuebiq, X-Mode, SafeGraph, PlaceIQ, and Gravy Analytics—before settling on UberMedia. (The company has no relation to the rideshare app Uber.) UberMedia was started by the veteran advertising and technology executive Bill Gross, who had helped invent keyword-targeted ads—the kinds of ads that appear on Google when you search a specific term. UberMedia had started out as an advertising company that helped brands reach customers on Twitter. But over time, like many other companies in this space, UberMedia realized that it could do more than just target consumers with advertising. With access to several ad exchanges, it could save bid requests that contained geolocation information, and then it could sell that data. Now, this was technically against the rules of most ad exchanges, but there was little way to police the practice. At its peak, UberMedia was collecting about 200,000 bid requests per second on mobile devices around the world.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Just as UberMedia was operating in a bit of a gray zone, PlanetRisk had likewise not been entirely forthright with UberMedia. To get the Aleppo data, Yeagley told UberMedia that he needed the data as part of PlanetRisk’s work with a humanitarian organization—when in fact the client was a defense contractor doing research work funded by the Pentagon. (UberMedia’s CEO would later learn the truth about what Mike Yeagley wanted the data for. And others in the company had their own suspicions. “Humanitarian purposes” was a line met with a wink and nod around the company among employees who knew or suspected what was going on with Yeagley’s data contracts.) Either way, UberMedia wasn’t vetting its customers closely. It appeared to be more eager to make a sale than it was concerned about the privacy implications of selling the movement patterns of millions of people.</p><p>When it came time to produce a demo of PlanetRisk’s commercial phone-tracking product, Yeagley’s 10-year-old daughter helped him come up with a name. They called the program Locomotive—a portmanteau of <em>location</em> and <em>motive</em>. The total cost to build out a small demo was about $600,000, put up entirely by a couple of Pentagon research funding arms. As the PlanetRisk team put Locomotive through the paces and dug into the data, they found one interesting story after another.</p><p>In one instance they could see a device moving back and forth between Syria and the West—a potential concern given ISIS’s interest in recruiting Westerners, training them, and sending them back to carry out terrorist attacks. But as the PlanetRisk team took a closer look, the pattern of the device’s behavior indicated that it likely belonged to a humanitarian aid worker. They could track that person’s device to UN facilities and a refugee camp, unlikely locales for Islamic State fighters to hang out.</p><p>They realized they could track world leaders through Locomotive, too. After acquiring a data set on Russia, the team realized they could track phones in the Russian president Vladimir Putin’s entourage. The phones moved everywhere that Putin did. They concluded the devices in question did not actually belong to Putin himself; Russian state security and counterintelligence were better than that. Instead, they believed the devices belonged to the drivers, the security personnel, the political aides, and other support staff around the Russian president; those people’s phones were trackable in the advertising data. As a result, PlanetRisk knew where Putin was going and who was in his entourage.</p><p>There were other oddities. In one data set, they found one phone kept transiting between the United States and North Korea. The device would attend a Korean church in the United States on Sundays. Its owner appeared to work at a GE factory, a prominent American corporation with significant intellectual property and technology that a regime like Pyongyang would be interested in. Why was it traveling back and forth between the United States and North Korea, not exactly known as a tourist destination? PlanetRisk considered raising the issue with either the US intelligence agencies or the company but ultimately decided there wasn’t much they could do. And they didn’t necessarily want their phone-tracking tool to be widely known. They never got to the bottom of it.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Most alarmingly, PlanetRisk began seeing evidence of the US military’s own missions in the Locomotive data. Phones would appear at American military installations such as Fort Bragg in North Carolina and MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida—home of some of the most skilled US special operators with the Joint Special Operations Command and other US Special Operations Command units. They would then transit through third-party countries like Turkey and Canada before eventually arriving in northern Syria, where they were clustering at the abandoned Lafarge cement factory outside the town of Kobane.</p><p>It dawned on the PlanetRisk team that these were US special operators converging at an unannounced military facility. Months later, their suspicions would be publicly confirmed; eventually the US government would acknowledge the facility was a forward operating base for personnel deployed in the anti-ISIS campaign.</p><p>Even worse, through Locomotive, they were getting data in pretty close to real time. UberMedia’s data was usually updated every 24 hours or so. But sometimes, they saw movement that had occurred as recently as 15 or 30 minutes earlier. Here were some of the best-trained special operations units in the world, operating at an unannounced base. Yet their precise, shifting coordinates were showing up in UberMedia’s advertising data. While Locomotive was a closely held project meant for government use, UberMedia’s data was available for purchase by anyone who could come up with a plausible excuse. It wouldn’t be difficult for the Chinese or Russian government to get this kind of data by setting up a shell company with a cover story, just as Mike Yeagley had done.</p><p>Initially, PlanetRisk was sampling data country by country, but it didn’t take long for the team to wonder what it would cost to buy the entire world. The sales rep at UberMedia provided the answer: For a few hundred thousand dollars a month, the company would provide a global feed of every phone on earth that the company could collect on. The economics were impressive. For the military and intelligence community, a few hundred thousand a month was essentially a rounding error—in 2020, the intelligence budget was $62.7 billion. Here was a powerful intelligence tool for peanuts.</p><p>Locomotive, the first version of which was coded in 2016, blew away Pentagon brass. One government official demanded midway through the demo that the rest of it be conducted inside a SCIF, a secure government facility where classified information could be discussed. The official didn’t understand how or what PlanetRisk was doing but assumed it must be a secret. A PlanetRisk employee at the briefing was mystified. “We were like, well, this is just stuff we’ve seen commercially,” they recall. “We just licensed the data.” After all, how could marketing data be classified?</p><p>Government officials were so enthralled by the capability that PlanetRisk was asked to keep Locomotive quiet. It wouldn’t be classified, but the company would be asked to tightly control word of the capability to give the military time to take advantage of public ignorance of this kind of data and turn it into an operational surveillance program.</p><p>And the same executive remembered leaving another meeting with a different government official. They were on the elevator together when one official asked, could you figure out who is cheating on their spouse?</p><p>Yeah, I guess you could, the PlanetRisk executive answered.</p><p><span>But Mike Yeagley</span> wouldn’t last at PlanetRisk.</p><p>As the company looked to turn Locomotive from a demo into a live product, Yeagley started to believe that his employer was taking the wrong approach. It was looking to build a data visualization platform for the government. Yet again, Yeagley thought it would be better to provide the raw data to the government and let them visualize it in any way they choose. Rather than make money off of the number of users inside government that buy a software license, Mike Yeagley wanted to just sell the government the data for a flat fee.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>So Yeagley and PlanetRisk parted ways. He took his business relationship with UberMedia with him. PlanetRisk moved on to other lines of work and was eventually sold off in pieces to other defense contractors. Yeagley would land at a company called Aelius Exploitation Technologies, where he would go about trying to turn Locomotive into an actual government program for the Joint Special Operations Command—the terrorist-hunting elite special operations force that killed Osama bin Laden and Ayman Al Zarqawi and spent the past few years dismantling ISIS.</p><p>Locomotive was renamed VISR, which stood for Virtual Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance. It would be used as part of an interagency program and would be shared widely inside the US intelligence community as a tool to generate leads.</p><p>By the time Yeagley went out to warn various security agencies about Grindr in 2019, VISR had been used domestically, too—at least for a short period of time when the FBI wanted to test its usefulness in domestic criminal cases. (In 2018, the FBI backed out of the program.) The Defense Intelligence Agency, another agency that had access to the VISR data, has also acknowledged that it used the tool on five separate occasions to look inside the United States as part of intelligence-related investigations.</p><p>But VISR, by now, is only one product among others that sell adtech data to intelligence agencies. The Department of Homeland Security has been a particularly enthusiastic adopter of this kind of data. Three of its components—US Customs and Border Protection, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the US Secret Service —have bought more than 200 licenses from commercial ad tech vendors since 2019. They would use this data for finding border tunnels, tracking down unauthorized immigrants, and trying to solve domestic crimes. In 2023, a government inspector general chastised DHS over the use of adtech, saying that the department did not have adequate privacy safeguards in place and recommending that the data stop being used until policies were drawn. The DHS told the inspector general that they would continue to use the data. Adtech “is an important mission contributor to the ICE investigative process as, in combination with other information and investigative methods, it can fill knowledge gaps and produce investigative leads that might otherwise remain hidden,” the agency wrote in response.</p><p>Other governments’ intelligence agencies have access to this data as well. Several Israeli companies—<a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-09-14/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/revealed-israeli-cyber-firms-developed-an-insane-new-spyware-tool-no-defense-exists/0000018a-93cb-de77-a98f-ffdf2fb60000">Insanet</a>, <a data-offer-url="https://www.404media.co/inside-global-phone-spy-tool-patternz-nuviad-real-time-bidding/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.404media.co/inside-global-phone-spy-tool-patternz-nuviad-real-time-bidding/&quot;}" href="https://www.404media.co/inside-global-phone-spy-tool-patternz-nuviad-real-time-bidding/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patternz</a>, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-11/surveillance-company-turns-ad-data-into-government-tracking-tool?ref=404media.co&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Rayzone</a>—have built similar tools to VISR and sell it to national security and public safety entities around the world, according to reports. Rayzone has even developed the capability to deliver malware through targeted ads, according to <em>Haaretz</em>.</p><p>Which is to say, none of this is an abstract concern—even if you’re just a private citizen. I’m here to tell you if you’ve ever been on a dating app that wanted your location or if you ever granted a weather app permission to know where you are 24/7, there is a good chance a detailed log of your precise movement patterns has been vacuumed up and saved in some data bank somewhere that tens of thousands of total strangers have access to. That includes intelligence agencies. It includes foreign governments. It includes private investigators. It even includes nosy journalists. (In 2021, a small conservative Catholic blog named <em>The Pillar</em> reported that Jeffrey Burrill, the secretary general of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, was a regular user of Grindr. The publication reported that Burrill “visited gay bars and private residences while using a location-based hookup app” and described its source as “commercially available records of app signal data obtained by <em>The Pillar.</em>”)</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>If you cheated on your spouse in the past few years and you were careless about your location data settings, there is a good chance there is evidence of that in data that is available for purchase. If you checked yourself into an inpatient drug rehab, that data is probably sitting in a data bank somewhere. If you told your boss you took a sick day and interviewed at a rival company, that could be in there. If you threw a brick through a storefront window during the George Floyd protests, well, your cell phone might link you to that bit of vandalism. And if you once had a few pints before causing a car crash and drove off without calling the police, data telling that story likely still exists somewhere.</p><p>We all have a vague sense that our cell phone carriers have this data about us. But law enforcement generally needs to go get a court order to get that. And it takes evidence of a crime to get such an order. This is a different kind of privacy nightmare.</p><p>I once met a disgruntled former employee of a company that competed against UberMedia and PlaceIQ. He had absconded with several gigabytes of data from his former company. It was only a small sampling of data, but it represented the comprehensive movements of tens of thousands of people for a few weeks. Lots of those people could be traced back to a residential address with a great deal of confidence. He offered me the data so I could see how invasive and powerful it was.</p><p>What can I do with this—hypothetically? I asked. In theory, could you help me draw geofences around mental hospitals? Abortion clinics? Could you look at phones that checked into a motel midday and stayed for less than two hours?</p><p>Easily, he answered.</p><p>I never went down that road.</p><p><em>Adapted from</em> Means of Control: How the Hidden Alliance of Tech and Government Is Creating a New American Surveillance State, <em>by Byron Tau, to be published February 27, 2024, by Crown, an imprint of the Crown Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC; Copyright © 2024 by Panopticon Project LLC.</em></p><hr><p><em>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

<p>Pennsylvania resident Joshua Wingenroth was convicted of multiple wildlife violations in Lancaster County District Court on Thursday for using a drone to help recover a deer. It’s the first time anyone in the state has been cited and tried for using the technology to recover a game animal. Wingenroth, who owns <a href="https://www.wingyds.com/" rel="noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Wingy Drone Services</a>, tells <em>Outdoor Life </em>that he plans to appeal the decision at the state court level.</p>



<p>The four charges against Wingenroth stemmed from a December sting operation by the Pennsylvania Game Commission in which an officer called Wingenroth pretending to be a hunter who had wounded a deer and needed help recovering it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The conviction was delivered even as a bill to legalize drones for deer recovery works its way through the Pennsylvania legislature, and as other states grapple with <a href="https://www.outdoorlife.com/hunting/drones-deer-recovery/">how to regulate drones during hunting season</a>. The judge acknowledged this lack of regulatory guidance in his ruling last week.</p>



<p>“The Legislature needs to address this,” Magisterial District Court Judge Raymond Sheller said while delivering his verdict, according to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-hunting-laws-drone-deer-carcass-c7d28318706d64f468b18dfe788510fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Associated Press</a>. “Everyone is playing catchup to science.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even so, Judge Sheller found Wingenroth guilty of two counts of using illegal electronic devices during hunting, one count of disturbing game or wildlife, and one count of violating regulations on recreational spotlighting. Wingenroth was fined $1,500.</p>

<p>Because he plans to appeal, Wingenroth declined to provide additional comment on the court’s decision. Instead, he shared a statement from his attorney Michael A. Siddons. A guilty verdict was expected, says Siddons. But he explains that the larger issue of whether drones should be allowed to recover dead game was overshadowed by “bombshell” testimony by two PGC game wardens that he says “could have profound and draconian consequences for the hunting public.”</p>



<p>The two game wardens were involved in the sting operation against Wingenroth, which took place at the Welsh Mountain Nature Preserve in Lancaster County on Dec. 6. Wingenroth responded to the warden’s request for help recovering a deer and flew the area with his drone; when he shined one of the drone’s lights on a live whitetail, the second officer arrived to seize Wingenroth’s drone and issue the four citations against him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Both the arresting officer and the undercover officer — both a game warden for over 30 years each — testified that it is illegal to recover downed game at night without a weapon,” Siddons writes. “This position is against all known conventional understanding of the hunting public, [and] the requirements under the Game and Wildlife Code regarding a hunter’s legal obligation to use all best efforts to recover downed game animals.”</p>



<p>Siddons says their testimony proved that PGC doesn’t seem to have a uniform position on the difference between hunting an animal and recovering it. He argued during the summary trial that Wingenroth was using his drone with the sole intention of recovering a dead deer.</p>



<p>PGC did not immediately reply to requests for comment, but PGC communications director Travis Lau told <a href="https://www.lancasterfarming.com/country-life/drone-operator-found-guilty-in-deer-recovery-case/article_5165cf50-d289-11ee-9bb6-93762d1d8463.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><em>Lancaster Farming</em></a> on Friday that the agency views recovery as part of the hunt. He clarified that hunters are permitted to track downed game after dark, but that they’re asked to notify the agency first.</p>



<p>“Our position has been unified that hunting and recovery are the same. The definition in Title 34 includes tracking and pursuit,” Lau said. “Tracking a wounded animal would be hunting under the letter of the law.”</p>



<p>In his written statement, Siddons argues that by citing Wingenroth on Dec. 6, the agency was enforcing its laws inconsistently and “further confounding the situation.” He says that during the trial, neither game warden could recall ever citing a hunter for trying to recover downed game at night — nor could they point to a single section of the state’s game code that supported their position. That code was amended in 2018 <a href="https://www.media.pa.gov/Pages/Game-Commission-Details.aspx?newsid=246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to allow the use of tracking dogs</a> when recovering deer and other big game.</p>



<p>Under the “recreational spotlighting” section of Title 34, the <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/34/34.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pennsylvania Game and Wildlife Code</a> explicitly prohibits the use of a spotlight “to search for or locate for any purpose any game or wildlife anywhere within this Commonwealth at any time during the antlered deer rifle season and during the antlerless deer rifle season.” It is not immediately clear if this applies to dead or wounded game, since Title 34 does not explicitly address the use of lights or flashlights for recovering game. Another section prohibits hunters from using artificial lights of any kind while carrying a firearm or other weapon, but there is no mention anywhere in the game code of prohibitions against recovering or tracking downed game at night.    </p>



<p>“Having such an inconsistent and ambiguous position with respect to the enforcement of the Game and Wildlife Code should give every hunter who is faced with recovering downed game at night grave concern,” Siddons writes.</p>



<p>As Wingenroth awaits a decision on his plea to appeal the guilty verdict, at least one state lawmaker has been seeking clarity on the controversial issue of drones and deer recovery — one that revolves around whether the technology violates the principles of fair chase.</p>



<p>In response to the December sting operation, State Sen. Jarret Coleman (R-LeHigh) proposed new legislation in January that would amend Title 34 of the Pennsylvania Game and Wildlife Code to legalize drones and other electronic devices for deer recovery. Many drones used for deer recovery, including Wingenroth’s, are equipped with thermal imaging, and several states have already legalized these devices for deer recovery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The state of Ohio permits the use of drones in the recovery of downed game. Unfortunately, the Pennsylvania Game Commission appears to be taking a hostile view of the use of drones in game recovery,” Coleman wrote in <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=S&amp;SPick=20230&amp;cosponId=41893" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Jan. 2 memorandum</a> seeking co-sponsors for his bill. “Pennsylvanians deserve better. With the advent of drones, hunters have an additional tool to use and reduce the amount of dead game that goes uncollected.”</p>



<p>Coleman also told the <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/life/outdoors/deer-drone-hunting-laws-pennsylvania-ohio-20240116.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em></a><em> </em>last month that he thinks using drones to recover deer is “common sense” and that the state shouldn’t overthink regulations around the technology.</p>

<p>Thanks to Samantha Cole at 404 Media, we are now aware that <a href="https://www.404media.co/tumblr-and-wordpress-to-sell-users-data-to-train-ai-tools/">Automattic plans to sell user data from Tumblr and WordPress.com</a> (which is the host for my blog) for “AI” products.</p>



<p>In response to journalists probing this shady decision from Automattic leadership, the company said nothing but published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240228025838/https://automattic.com/2024/02/27/protecting-user-choice/">a statement</a>.</p>



<p>This statement, which was presumably filtered through more lawyers than their CEO’s <a href="https://twitter.com/kthorjensen/status/1761599420330823935">recent Twitter rambling against trans users</a> (or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240228022939/https://staff.tumblr.com/post/743224389484625920/a-message-from-a-few-of-the-trans-staff-at-tumblr">Automattic employees’ statement about his conduct</a> for that matter), betrays a critical misunderstanding of what consent is.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are also working directly with select AI companies as long as their plans align with what our community cares about: attribution, <strong><u>opt-outs,</u></strong> and control.</p>
<cite>Emphasis mine</cite></blockquote>



<p>This is not the tech industry’s most egregious lack of understanding of consent in recent years. That dishonor belongs to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/paqvn7/dont-fuck-anybody-who-wants-to-get-your-consent-uploaded-to-the-blockchain-legalfling-app">LegalFling</a>: A blockchain app for sexual consent.</p>



<p>However, this is still pretty stupid, and the result of an insidious trend that doesn’t get questioned enough in software engineering circles. So I’m asking that my readers shout this from the fucking rooftops.</p>



<h2>Opt-Out Is NOT Consent</h2>



<p>Opt-out is “our lawyers told us to make this an option to cover our ass, but we don’t want you to actually do it”.</p>



<p>Opt-out is “if you missed the memo, we assume we have your consent”.</p>



<p>The default state of any decision regarding user data should be opted out. Users should instead be required to opt in for your decision to take effect, and they must not be coerced into doing so.</p>



<p>If consent is not explicitly given by an informed user, you haven’t received consent at all, and to pretend otherwise is unethical.</p>



<p>Your users don’t fucking care about opt-out. We care about opt-in.</p>



<h3>“But Soatok, That’ll Hurt Our Revenue”</h3>



<p>If you <em>have to</em> make money doing unethical things, or by following dubious practices that don’t actually respect other users’ autonomy, then you should go out of business.</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AaU6tI2pb3M?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>End of.</p>



<h2>What Automattic Should Do</h2>



<p>If Automattic wants to make things right, they must do two things and could do a third thing (but I’m not holding my breath):</p>



<p>First, nuke the existing opt-out mechanism and replace it with an opt-in mechanism. If nobody checks it, then don’t include their data in the sale to Midjourney or OpenAI.</p>



<p>Second, they should make the permission for third-parties more granular. Some of us don’t care about third parties, but do NOT want “AI” companies using their data to enable plagiarism.</p>



<p>Third, if you want to go the extra mile, add support for a plugin that uses <a href="https://nightshade.cs.uchicago.edu/whatis.html">Nightshade</a> on all hosted media in all WordPress.com plans, including free plans, to increase your users’ protection against LLM scrapists.</p>



<p>This is my open challenge to Automattic leadership to do better.</p>



<h2>This Issue is Bigger than Automattic</h2>



<p>The tech industry has gotten very bad at respecting users’ consent lately. Your options are no longer “Yes” and “No” anymore. Instead it’s “Yes” or “Maybe Later”, without a “Never” option.</p>



<figure><figcaption>This entire goddamn thread.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>It does keep going. I’m going to skip a few, but check it out.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Yes, even Linux is affected.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even worse, you can rarely uninstall the crapware that nags you with these consent dialogs.</p>



<p>This needs to stop. It’s a toxic mentality and it cultivates a culture that doesn’t respect humanity. (Which is kind of funny to write as a furry blogger.)</p>



<p>If you work in the tech industry, scream very loudly about properly implementing human-respecting consent controls into your software.</p>



<p>Just because it’s widespread doesn’t mean it’s inevitable. Push back against it. Your less privileged, less technical neighbors deserve better.</p>
