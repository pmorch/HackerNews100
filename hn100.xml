<p><span>On the last full day of his country’s existence, South Vietnamese air force Maj. Buang-Ly stole a tiny two-seat airplane. He helped his wife and their five children<b>, </b>ages 14 months to 6 years, into the backseat and storage area before climbing into the pilot’s seat. They took off and headed out to sea while enemy ground fire zipped past them. </span></p>



<p><span>It was April 29, 1975, and chaos had enveloped the nation. Two years earlier, the 1973 Paris peace agreement had theoretically ended the war, but after American combat forces left the country, the North Vietnamese took the opportunity to press their new strategic advantage. The long war between North and South Vietnam paused only briefly before ferocious fighting resumed.</span></p>



<p>In early 1975, the North Vietnamese Army seized key bases in the Central Highlands, and, by the end of March, had captured areas along the coast. The remaining American advisers and many South Vietnamese families began frenzied evacuations on American military aircraft and civilian transport planes.</p>



<p>Those large, fixed-wing aircraft flew thousands of people to hastily constructed camps in the Philippines, Guam and Wake Island. The last plane out of Da Nang, a civilian Boeing 727 on March 29, was unable to retract its landing gear in flight because at least seven of the 290 passengers had climbed into its wheel wells. Soon North Vietnamese forces were shelling Saigon.</p>

<p><b>Buang and his family were stationed on Con Son Island</b><strong>,</strong> about 50 miles off the southern coast and home to one of the last bases still under South Vietnamese control. Used mainly as a prison camp, the island also had a small airfield. When Buang and his wife learned that North Vietnamese forces were closing in, they loaded as many of their possessions as possible into the plane and got airborne—with no plan for what to do next.</p>



<p><span>Their tiny aircraft, an O-1 Bird Dog, was a modified Cessna 170, a light, single-engine tail dragger with fixed landing gear. Ruggedly built and highly maneuverable, Bird Dogs flew over South Vietnam’s terrain during the war, spotting enemy targets and then marking them with white phosphorous rockets to guide U.S. artillery shelling and airstrikes. The planes could take off and land on a dime, but their range was limited to just over 500 miles when fully fueled—and Buang’s fuel tank was not. </span></p>



<p><span>As Buang coaxed the overloaded plane airborne, he faced enormous challenges. The Bird Dog was not designed to operate over water. It lacked sophisticated navigation equipment, life vests and the ability to safely ditch in an emergency. Buang had never seen, much less landed on, an aircraft carrier—and to make matters worse, this Bird Dog had no working radio because Buang had not been able to bring a headset. Still, he knew that his family was more likely to find safety out at sea, where the U.S. Navy was in control, than on the land now controlled by communist forces under Gen. Van Tien Dung.</span></p>



<p><span>After flying for a half-hour, Buang spotted a gaggle of helicopters in the distance heading east. At the time he had no idea they were loaded with friendly evacuees, but it seemed like a good idea to follow them. “I was searching for a safe place,” Buang later recalled. “It made me think there was something out there they could depend on.”</span></p>



<p><span><b>On April 19, 10 days before the Buang family </b>departed Con Son Island, the aircraft carrier USS <em>Midway</em> had received orders to leave Naval Station Subic Bay in the Philippines and make best speed toward Saigon to help evacuate the roughly 5,000 Americans remaining there, including diplomats, CIA agents, contractors and a handful of Marines. <em>Midway</em> and the rest of the 7th Fleet would also evacuate as many friendly Vietnamese as possible. </span></p>



<p><span>The old ship had been in service since September 1945 and was just starting a pier side repair period. Its engineering plant, which had been taken offline for maintenance, needed to be hastily restored to operation, and the ship got underway with fewer sailors than normal. At Subic Bay, <em>Midway</em> offloaded half of the fixed-wing jets in its combat air wing. When the ship reached the South China Sea, it received 10 large <a href="https://www.historynet.com/hh-53-super-jolly-green-giant.htm">Sikorsky H-53</a> helicopters—two U.S. Air Force HH-53s from the 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron and eight CH-53s from the Air Force’s 21st Special Operations Squadron. Each of these choppers could comfortably transport 55 passengers at a time. </span></p>



<p><span>The mission, dubbed Operation Frequent Wind, would employ an ad-hoc fleet of helicopters and several elements of the 7th Fleet—an impressive array of combat vehicles—to conduct a massive humanitarian operation, transporting and caring for thousands of refugees. During transit, the carrier’s crew got busy training for the work ahead.</span></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="640" src="https://www.historynet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nam-Cessna-refugee-960_640.jpg" alt="Refugees on the Midway are led by the crew to a place where they can get medical care.

<p>Throughout the war, most air operations from carriers like <em>Midway</em> had been combat sorties: bombing, intelligence gathering and combat air patrol. Noncombat logistics operations normally took up only a small slice of a day’s action on the flight deck. The logistics crews usually transferred a few dozen passengers a day, maybe brought onboard a new jet engine or other supplies, and shipped mail via plane or helicopter.</p>



<p>Typically, a junior air transfer officer leading a crew of about a dozen sailors could easily handle the load. But for Operation Frequent Wind, the entire ship and its crew were devoted to the effort. The carrier’s senior enlisted sailors led the rest of the crew in drills designed to account for every imaginable problem.</p>



<p><span>On the morning of April 29, former South Vietnamese Prime Minister and Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky, accompanied by Lt. Gen. Ngo Quang Truong, requested permission to land on the <em>Midway</em>, after making a one-hour, 15-minute helicopter flight from the mainland. Their arrival signaled to the carrier’s officers that Operation Frequent Wind had begun. About 11 a.m. that morning Secretary of State Henry Kissinger finally gave American diplomats the order to evacuate. An American radio station broadcast the secret signal: “The temperature in Saigon is 105 degrees and rising,” followed by Tennessee Ernie Ford’s “White Christmas”</span><span>—</span><span>because the DJ couldn’t find the more well-known Bing Crosby version. The signal told evacuees in Saigon to move to pre-assigned extraction locations, board buses there and head to the airport. </span></p>



<p><span><b>As the official evacuation commenced</b><strong>,</strong> many resourceful Vietnamese commandeered whatever aircraft they could to fly to safety. “At least 74 planes of the South Vietnamese Air Force, including about 30 F-5 fighters, streamed into the U Taphao air base in southern Thailand from South Vietnam without warning,” </span><span><em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em> reported the next day. “The pilots and passengers—about 2,000 people—requested asylum,” and more planes kept arriving. Thai officials declared their intention to return the aircraft to South Vietnam, which soon became impossible as the South was absorbed into a unified Vietnam under Hanoi’s communist leadership.</span></p>



<p><span>More choppers began arriving on <em>Midway</em>’s flight deck. The ship’s contingent of Marines and the sergeant at arms searched the new arrivals for contraband and weapons, confiscating pistols and wads of worthless South Vietnamese cash that they threw over the side. Then they helped passengers into the ship’s command structure on the starboard side, known as “the island,” where crew members gave them food and basic medical care. All but 80 or so of the most dire cases were transferred by helicopter to other ships to be distributed across the whole fleet, a process that went on well into the next day. </span></p>



<p><span>Young, tough sailors who were used to handling bombs, chains and fuel lines amid the roar of jet engines now devoted themselves to caring for bewildered parents, frightened children, the elderly and the sick. The flight deck was choked with choppers and lines of men and women carrying suitcases and children. The hangar bay below decks ran out of room for more aircraft as efforts to aid hundreds of refugees continued there.</span></p>



<p><span>The <em>Midway</em> was commanded by Capt. Lawrence Chambers, the first African-American carrier captain and just the second to graduate from the U.S. Naval Academy when he earned his degree in 1952. Chambers had reported aboard the carrier in January 1975 and been in command for only a few weeks. In a television interview 35 years later, he recalled the scene as he watched from his chair on the bridge, just above the action: “A flight deck is a hazardous operation under normal conditions. And when you see little kids and mothers holding little babies, and airplanes, helicopters are taking off and landing, you just kind of hold your breath.” </span></p>



<p>Weather conditions were not ideal, observed the ship’s air boss, Cmdr. Vern Jumper, from his perch five stories above the flight deck in the Primary Flight Control room<b>. </b>Jumper was responsible for all aspects of flight operations, including any aircraft flying near the ship, all the action on the flight deck, and the work happening down in the hangar bay. He noted rain falling from a 500-foot cloud ceiling, 15 knots (17 mph) of wind over the deck and 5 miles visibility. But the seas remained relatively calm, which meant the deck, though sometimes slick with water, wasn’t pitching.</p>



<p><span>Air traffic controllers inside the ship and landing signals crew on deck used whatever means necessary to keep helicopters in order as they approached. Communication went smoothly with the 10 H-53 helicopters that were part of the operation. They would land, unload, refuel and make repeated trips to Saigon. By mid-afternoon, an additional 45 <a href="https://www.historynet.com/arsenal-uh-1-iroquois-huey-helicopter.htm">UH-1 Iroquois</a> “Huey” helicopters had arrived from the mainland. Most had no ability to communicate with the ship via radio. “We were using hand signals to the pilots to control where they landed on the flight deck,” Jumper recalled 35 years later. Sailors and aircrews also communicated via signal flags and colored signal lamps—red, don’t land; green, OK to land. </span></p>



<p>Every pilot managed his fuel and waited patiently for his turn. At one point, Jumper and his assistant, Cmdr. Pete Theodorelos, counted 26 helicopters circling the carrier while sailors assisted waves of arriving passengers. As soon as a chopper’s rotors stopped twirling, sailors pushed it away from the action, using small rectangular tractors or brute manpower. By packing the incoming aircraft close together, they were able to recover them all. None had to ditch next to the carrier, but the flight deck soon filled to capacity.</p>

<p><b>Toward the end of that wild afternoon</b>, spotters on the carrier saw a tiny two-seat Cessna come into view. Through binoculars they counted at least four people in the plane, which had South Vietnamese markings. The Bird Dog began circling overhead with its landing lights switched on. Periodically the pilot rocked the plane’s wings. A Vietnamese translator was rushed to Primary Flight Control to join Jumper and Theodorelos in the ship’s tower, but attempts to radio the plane were met with static. From the bridge Chambers quickly consulted task force commander Adm. William Harris, who was at his battle station below deck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The admiral ordered me to tell the Bird Dog to ditch,” Chambers later recalled. A helicopter could be dispatched to drop swimmers in the water and rescue the occupants. Other pilots flying choppers near the rest of the 7th Fleet were putting their aircraft into the sea. They hovered to drop passengers onto the fleet’s smaller ships, including destroyers and supply craft. When all passengers had safely left a chopper, the pilot would maneuver away and steer the machine on a course to safely ditch into open water. At the last moment he would jump clear of the rotors and drop into the sea, then swim toward the nearest vessel.</p>



<p><span>However, the fixed-wing Bird Dog couldn’t hover to drop off its passengers, and its fixed landing gear would cause the plane to flip onto its back as soon as the wheels touched the water. Only a well-trained crew member, properly strapped in, would get out alive. If the plane was ditched, the rest of its occupants had almost no chance. </span></p>



<p>“My judgment told me, if I didn’t give him a chance to land that he was going to crash it on the deck,” Chambers said.</p>



<p>As the Bird Dog circled, the pilot dropped three paper notes from the plane, but they blew over the side before the ship’s crew could snatch them. On the next pass he stuffed a fourth note into his pistol’s leather holster to weigh it down, and sailors rushed to grab the little package after it hit the deck. They read a scribbled message written on a crumpled chart of South Vietnam: Can you mouve [sic] these Helicopter to the other side, I can land on your runway, I can fly 1 hour more, we have enough time to mouve. Please rescue me. Major Buang wife and 5 child.</p>



<p>The message was quickly relayed to the bridge where Chambers was discussing the situation with Jumper over the phone. Ignoring pressure from the admiral, Chambers decided to do whatever was necessary to let the Bird Dog land, even if that meant throwing millions of dollars worth of equipment over the side and possibly being relieved of his command.</p>



<p>“Vern,” Chambers said into the phone, “give me a ready deck.” Jumper called for all available crewmen and volunteers to help prepare the angled flight deck for the Cessna. Meanwhile, with six boilers offline for maintenance, Chambers ordered his chief engineer to transfer the ship’s electric load to the emergency diesel engines and make steam for 25 knots (29 mph).</p>

<p>The captain turned his ship into the wind to prepare for a fixed-wing landing. Fire crews readied their hoses and donned fire-retardant suits. Since the Bird Dog had no tail hook, sailors removed the four landing cables that normally spanned the runway. Other crew members leaned in together to heave three Hueys and one Chinook over the side. When their skids went over the flight deck’s edge, the empty choppers nosed up, twisted, then fell backward into the sea with big splashes.</p>



<p><span>Immediately, five more airborne Huey pilots took advantage of the cleared runway to land and disembark their passengers. Assuming he would be court martialed, Chambers ordered those helicopters thrown overboard as well. He later told interviewers that since he expected to be deposed by prosecutors, he turned away from the action to avoid seeing exactly how many were pushed into the sea. In the same interview Jumper also claimed not to know how many helicopters went overboard. </span></p>



<p><span>The old ship rattled and groaned as its speed increased. Jumper gave the green lamp signal to land. Buang made two practice passes over the ship to get a feel for the approach while translators—in English and Vietnamese—tried to warn him about the dangerous downdrafts that naturally occur behind the ship’s fantail. With no response, the crew could only watch, hoping that he would carry enough power to fly through that turbulence.</span></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="640" src="https://www.historynet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Buang-family-960_640.jpg" alt="South Vietnamese Major Buang and his family are escorted by a Marine Security Guard across the deck of the USS Midway in one of the most dramatic moments during operation Frequent Wind.

<p><span>Buang lowered the Bird Dog’s flaps and approached in a shallow descent at a speed of 60 knots (69 mph). With the ship providing an estimated 40 knots (46 mph) of headwind to aid the landing, the light plane slowly caught up. It seemed to flutter for a moment just above the deck, then bounced once in the landing area and rolled to a smooth stop in the middle of the runway.</span></p>



<p><span>Dozens of sailors ran toward the plane to grab it in case the aircraft’s momentum was enough to send it over the side, but the Bird Dog stayed where it had stopped. A hodgepodge of&nbsp;</span><span>squadron crew and ship’s company weighed the plane down with their bodies while Buang and his wife, carrying their youngest child, climbed out of the cockpit. He pulled forward the seat and out tumbled the other four children. Cheers rang out and sailors clapped while the family walked into the ship’s island. </span></p>



<p><span><b>Altogether, 71 American helicopters</b> flew a total of 662 sorties from Saigon to the 7th<span>&nbsp;</span>Fleet’s ships, rescuing more than 7,800 people. The 10 Air Force H-53s flew four round trips from the Midway to Saigon, evacuating more than 1,400 personnel from the start of the operation on the morning of April 29 until its end at 9 a.m. on April 30. Three hours later, South Vietnamese Gen. Duong Van Minh surrendered Saigon to North Vietnamese Col. Bui Tin, effectively ending the war—as well as the nation of South Vietnam.</span></p>



<p><span>The Bird Dog Buang-Ly flew that day now hangs at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida. Chambers kept his job as the aircraft carrier’s captain and was later promoted to rear admiral; he retired in 1984. Nobody was prosecuted for the estimated $10 million loss of the helicopters that Chambers ordered overboard. The Midway’s crew collected money to help ease the transition for the Buang family, who became seven of the estimated 130,000 refugees from the Vietnam War to eventually resettle in the United States. All seven are now naturalized American citizens. </span></p>

<h2 id="but-why">But… Why?</h2>

<p>TL;DR Well, the Steam Deck didn’t fit in my backpack…</p>

<p>The Steam Deck has been a game changer for travel, but I found myself leaving it behind more often than not, as it wouldn’t fit in my backpack, took up a huge amount of carry-on space, and was a hassle to bring down from the overhead compartment when I wanted to use it.
When I did use the Deck, it was either plugged in to AR Glasses (<a href="https://amzn.to/3CpmMgW">XReal Air 2 Pro</a>) or plugged in to a TV. So, I got to thinking: it could be so much smaller and lighter without the build in controller and screen, but that would be ridiculous, right? …right?</p>

<h2 id="️-disclaimer">⚠️ Disclaimer</h2>
<p>“I am not a smart man”</p>

<p>This project was not approved or endorsed in any way by Valve and is generally a very bad idea. I’m honestly surprised it worked and have no idea how long the modified console will survive. The following is provided “as is” and without any expressed or implied warranty. If you choose to attempt this do so at your own risk. Be warned that are likely to “brick” (as in destroy, but pun intended) your console and you might get hurt in the process (lithium batteries and power tools are dangerous, among other things).</p>

<p>This is not a guide, more of a “how I did it”. If there’s enough interest, I might expand this to a more step-by-step style write-up.

<p>First of all – huge shoutout to iFixIt for their great <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Steam_Deck">Steam Deck Repair Guides</a> as well as to Valve for supporting the DIY repair and mod community!</p>

<p>This mod was performed on a <a href="https://amzn.to/40MP0f7">1TB OLED Steam Deck</a>, there are some differences between the OLED and LCD models.</p>

<p>The first hurdle on this ridiculous road was figuring out if the Steam Deck would even boot without any peripherals or a screen attached. Working off the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Steam+Deck+Battery+Replacement/149070">battery replacement</a> and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Steam+Deck+Motherboard+Replacement/148928">motherboard replacement</a> tutorials was able disconnect everything from the motherboard other than the fan – success!
In this state the Deck will boot output display over USB and accept peripherals via an external dock.</p>

<h2 id="internals">Internals</h2>

<p>This initial teardown also revealed a useful aluminum(?) frame, unfortunately, you’ll have to remove the screen [link] to remove it from the shell. This shell had some unnecessary “wings” so of course they had to be removed with a rotary tool. With the excess metal removed, I had the perfect internal frame for the Brick.</p>

<p>Note that some of the fan and motherboard cover screws are outer-shell screws which must be added back so everything is properly held in place.</p>

<p>I probably should have removed or masked out the fan before grinding away the metal…</p>

<h2 id="case">Case</h2>

<p>Using my limited CAD abilities, I designed a rudimentary shell for the Brick. The shell has two pegs to align the board and you can add a dollop of PLA with a 3d printing pen to further secure the board to the case. There’s a cutout in the case to accommodate the original power button, and the air intake is sized to accept the metal grill from the original back shell.</p>

<p>I printed out the case in Overture Polycarbonate Pro (PC) [link] which <em>should</em> be  heat-resistant enough not to melt while the deck attempts to run Cyberpunk 2077. Color accents were added in PLA with a 3D printing pen.</p>

<p>And there it is, in all its glory: the Steam Brick!
About a 3rd of the size of the Deck, and about 4 times smaller than the Deck’s OEM case. As a bonus, it’s also 24% lighter!</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Why remove the screen? It wouldn’t have made the build larger!</strong></p>

<p>Keeping the screen would have significantly complicated the build, as you’d need something to keep in in place. More importantly – the brick was built to be tossed in a bag as-is. No case, no screen protector, just throw it in a backpack or suitcase and don’t worry about it!</p>

<p><strong>Why did you do this again?</strong></p>

<p>Because I was so preoccupied with whether or not I could that I didn’t stop to think if I should.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>The build includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>4x 3M heat set inserts</li>
  <li>4x 20mm 3M screws</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="known-issue">Known Issue</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Accessing the BIOS is currently impossible as it requires holding down the ‘+’ button while powering up, and that button isn’t included in the build. Haven’t found a workaround yet.</li>
  <li>It’s difficult to tell if the Brick is on or not – as the Deck’s indicator light doesn’t indicate on/off status</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the story of how Apple made a mistake in the ROM of the Macintosh Classic II that probably should have prevented it from booting, but instead, miraculously, its Motorola MC68030 CPU accidentally prevented a crash and saved the day by executing an undefined instruction.</p>



<p>I’ve been playing around with <a href="https://www.mamedev.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MAME</a> a lot lately. If you haven’t heard of MAME, it’s an emulator that is known best for its support of many arcade games. It’s so much more than that, though! It is also arguably the most complete emulator of 68000-based Mac models, thanks in large part to <a href="https://rbelmont.mameworld.info/" data-type="link" data-id="https://rbelmont.mameworld.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arbee</a>‘s incredible efforts. I will admit that I’ve used MAME to play a game or two of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles:_Turtles_in_Time" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles:_Turtles_in_Time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time</a>, but my main use for it is Mac emulation.</p>



<p>Here’s how this adventure begins. I had been <a href="https://github.com/mamedev/mame/commit/178e9fee20c508ca3c1125c2f211c43c8c848f6e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fixing some issues in MAME with the command + power key combination that invokes the debugger</a>, and decided to see if the keystroke also worked on the Classic II. Even though this Mac model has a physical interrupt button on the side, it also has an “Egret” 68HC05 microcontroller for handling the keyboard and mouse (among other things) that should be able to detect the keypress and signal a non-maskable interrupt to the main CPU. I believe the Egret disables this keystroke by default, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacsBug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MacsBug</a> contains code that sends the command to enable it.</p>



<p>I didn’t get very far while testing the command+power shortcut in MAME’s emulated Classic II, because I observed something very odd. It booted up totally fine in 24-bit addressing mode, but I could not get it to boot at all if I enabled 32-bit addressing, which I needed in order for MacsBug to load. It would just pop up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_startup#Sad_Mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sad Mac</a>, complete with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_startup#Chimes_of_Death" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chimes of Death</a>. On this machine, the death chime is a few notes from the Twilight Zone theme song.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-29.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="514" height="416" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-29.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-29.png 514w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-29-300x243.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px"></a></figure>



<p>If you’re not familiar with Apple’s whole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS_memory_management#32-bit_clean" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS_memory_management#32-bit_clean" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">24-bit versus 32-bit addressing saga</a>, I’ll briefly summarize it for you here. The original Motorola 68000 processor only had 24 address lines even though it used 32 bits internally for addresses. Apple took those eight extra otherwise unused bits and repurposed them for storing flags as a way to save on RAM, which was scarce at the time. When newer machines/processors came out that supported a full 32-bit address space, the upper byte couldn’t be used for flags anymore. Because of that discrepancy, old software would have been incompatible, so newer machines had two modes: 24-bit mode for compatibility with older software, and 32-bit mode for being able to use all of your RAM.</p>



<p>So why was the Classic II failing to boot in 32-bit mode in MAME? What was broken? Arbee also reproduced the issue, so at least I knew I wasn’t losing my mind. I assumed it was a random bug in MAME, so I started looking deeper into it to try to understand what needed to be fixed.</p>



<p>According to <a href="http://absurdengineering.org/library/MASTER%20Tech%20Info%20Library/Hardware%20Troubleshooting%20&amp;%20Service%20Issues/TIL07748%20-%20Macintosh%20-%20Sad%20Mac%20Error%20Code%20Meaning%20(11-95).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an old Apple Tech Info Library article</a>, 0000000F means an exception occurred and 00000001 means the exception was a bus error. A bus error on 68k Macs typically means that something tried to access an invalid address, like if you try to read from or write to an expansion card when there isn’t one installed.</p>



<p>What was the invalid address being accessed? I decided to step through the code using MAME’s amazing debugger to understand what was leading to the crash. Comprehending what’s going on in the ROM with no context at all can be tricky, but luckily, Apple included symbol maps for a bunch of Mac ROMs with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Programmer%27s_Workshop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Macintosh Programmer’s Workshop (MPW)</a>. MPW was Apple’s development environment.</p>



<p>Tracing backwards from the actual Sad Mac screen would be difficult, because there is a ton of code involved in setting up and displaying the screen. To make it easier on myself, I decided I would set a breakpoint on the bus error handler and then look backwards from there. The 68030’s vector table starts at the very beginning of the address space, and the bus error vector is at 0x00000008. With the Sad Mac error still on the screen, here’s what memory looked like at that location:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-26.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" width="571" height="193" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-26.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-26.png 571w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-26-300x101.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px"></a></figure>



<p>This meant the bus error handler was at 0x40A026F0, which is also known as <em>GenExcps</em> in the ROM map. I performed a hard reset of the emulated machine, set a breakpoint on that address, and then waited until it hit the breakpoint. It looks like <em>GenExcps</em> is a big list of BSR instructions that all jump to 0x40A026A0, which is common error handling code identified in the ROM map as <em>ToDeepShit</em>. Nice name, Apple!</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-32.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" width="795" height="393" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-32.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-32.png 795w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-32-300x148.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-32-768x380.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"></a></figure>



<p>Anyway, since MAME hit my breakpoint, this meant Apple’s technote was correct about it being a bus error. I was able to use the MAME debugger’s <em>history</em> command to show a backtrace of instructions that led to this point. The end of the history output is displayed in the bottom pane of the screenshot below:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-33.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="393" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-33.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-33.png 795w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-33-300x148.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-33-768x380.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"></a></figure>



<p>If we walk upwards, we can see that the instruction that caused the bus error was at 0x40A43B9C:</p>





<p>I opened up this section of code in IDA, which I still find myself using with 68k Mac stuff because I’m used to it. It was pretty clearly part of the routine that starts at 0x40A43B40, which is helpfully labeled in the ROM map as <em>InstallSoundIntHandler</em>. Let’s look at the whole function in more depth.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-3.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="756" height="107" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-3.png 756w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-3-300x42.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 756px) 100vw, 756px"></a></figure>



<p>The first thing it does is immediately jump to <em>V8SndIntPatch1</em>. This appears to be something that was patched into this ROM for handling sound initialization for the V8. For some added context, the Classic II isn’t powered by an eight-cylinder gasoline engine; V8 is the name of the custom chip that Apple first used in the Macintosh LC. From the LC hardware developer note:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="512" height="141" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-4.png" alt="A new custom VLSI (very large scale integration) chip, the V8 gate array, is the heart of the hardware design. It integrates the timing, address decode, video generation, clock generation, sound control, and GLU (general logic unit) functions that were provided by individual chips in earlier Macintosh computers." srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-4.png 512w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-4-300x83.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></figure>



<p>Why are we talking about the LC here? Well, the reason is because the Classic II is architecturally based more on the LC than the original Macintosh Classic. Here’s an explanation from the corresponding developer note for the Classic II:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="607" height="354" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-5.png" alt="Although the physical appearance of the Macintosh Classic II computer is very similar to that of the Macintosh Classic, the electrical design of the Macintosh Classic II is based as much as possible on the Macintosh LC architecture. Figure 1-1 is an overall block diagram of the Macintosh Classic II. Notice that the number of components has been significantly reduced through the use of custom integrated circuits. The following are the major changes in the Macintosh Classic II design:

The Macintosh Classic II uses an MC68030 processor rather than the MC68020 used by the Macintosh LC.
A new custom VLSI (very large-scale integration) chip, the EAGLE gate array, is the heart of the hardware design. It integrates the timing, memory mapping, video generation, clock generation, sound control, and glue functions that were provided by individual chips in the earlier Macintosh computers." srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-5.png 607w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-5-300x175.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px"></figure>



<p>The text description of the EAGLE gate array is very similar to that of the V8, so it should come as no surprise that the chips themselves are very similar too. MAME handles them both in the same source file. The point I’m trying to make here is that it makes sense that the Classic II’s ROM has code referring to the V8. With that info out of the way, let’s look at <em>V8SndIntPatch1</em>:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-6.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="763" height="240" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-6.png 763w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-6-300x94.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px"></a></figure>



<p>This chunk of code is calling the Gestalt trap, which is how you determine various info about the Mac. In particular, it’s using the gestaltHardwareAttr selector, which is defined as ‘hdwr’ in Apple’s public header files.</p>



<p>If bit 3 (gestaltHasASC) isn’t set in the response, it bails and returns. Otherwise, it jumps to <em>V8SndIntPatch1Rtn</em> at 0x40A43B4A, which you can see in the history trace in the MAME debugger screenshot from earlier. I went pretty deep into the hardware tables for the Classic II and can confirm that gestaltHasASC is definitely set on the Classic II. After all, the EAGLE contains a stripped-down equivalent of the Apple Sound Chip (ASC).</p>



<p>Now, let’s take a look at <em>V8SndIntPatch1Rtn</em>:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-7.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="1024" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-7-640x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-7-640x1024.png 640w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-7-188x300.png 188w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-7.png 722w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></figure>



<p>Phew! This is a decent amount of code. It’s not that complicated though. I’ll explain the important stuff. You can see the instruction that leads to the Sad Mac at 0x40A43B9C. If you start at the top, what’s happening is it’s loading a byte from RAM at 0xCB3 into register D0:</p>


<div><pre title="">moveq #$0,d0
move.b (byte_CB3).w,d0
</pre></div>


<p>If you know where to look out there, you can discover that this global variable is called BoxFlag and contains a value identifying which machine you have. If I step through this code in MAME, I can see that D0 ends up loaded with the value 0x11 = 17, which is correct for the Classic II.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-34.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="406" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-34.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-34.png 795w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-34-300x153.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-34-768x392.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"></a></figure>



<p>Continuing further through the code, some other stuff happens, and then at 0x40A43B6C the value in D0 ends up being doubled (so it turns into 0x22). Immediately after this, it is used as an offset in a jump instruction. Here’s IDA’s syntax for the jump, because it’s more intuitive than what MAME displays:</p>


<div><pre title="">add.w d0,d0
jmp loc_40A43B72(pc,d0.w)
</pre></div>


<p>Since D0 ends up as 0x22 after being doubled, we jump to 0x40A43B72 + 0x22 = 0x40A43B94, and here’s what that code looks like in MAME’s debugger when we reach it:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="393" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35.png 795w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35-300x148.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35-768x380.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"></a></figure>



<p>Stepping further through the code, you can see we eventually reach the instruction that causes a Sad Mac. Let’s see what all the registers look like before it’s executed:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-36.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="393" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-36.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-36.png 795w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-36-300x148.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-36-768x380.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"></a></figure>



<p>Hmm, that’s odd. This crashing instruction writes the value 0x90 to an offset 0x1C00 bytes past the address stored in A1. A1 is set to 0xFFFF8FBA, so the address where the write occurs at is 0xFFFF8FBA + 0x1C00 = 0xFFFFABBA. This is a totally invalid address on the Classic II! No wonder we get a Sad Mac. As expected, as soon as we step into this instruction, instead of reaching the RTS instruction just below it, we end up in the code path for displaying a Sad Mac error at 0x40A026F0. This is definitely where everything craps out.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-37.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="393" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-37.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-37.png 795w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-37-300x148.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-37-768x380.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"></a></figure>



<p>Okay, so now I had a pretty good idea of what was happening in MAME. A1 had a junk value, so the ROM code was writing to an invalid address. FFFFABBA dabba doo! I decided to investigate further to understand how A1 came to be loaded with a bad address. And that’s when I discovered something really bizarre.</p>



<p>Let’s take a closer look at one of the earlier screenshots, after we used the value of D0 (BoxFlag) to jump to the correct chunk of code for the Classic II:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="393" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35.png 795w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35-300x148.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-35-768x380.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"></a></figure>



<p>I thought about this some more, and eventually realized that something absolutely crazy happened here. We were supposed to be jumping into a table of BRA.S instructions, one for each possible BoxFlag value. That’s why we added D0 to itself before using it as a jump offset — each BRA.S instruction is two bytes long, so the index into the table needed to be doubled to turn it into a byte offset. Why didn’t we end up pointing at a BRA.S instruction? And where did this CAS.W instruction come from?</p>



<p>If you look closely at the table of branches below the JMP instruction at 0x40A43B6E, there are only 16 entries in the table, corresponding to BoxFlags 0 through 15. The Classic II is BoxFlag 17!</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-38.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="389" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-38.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-38.png 795w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-38-300x147.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-38-768x376.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"></a></figure>



<p>As I said earlier, the calculated offset we jump to is 0x40A43B94, which is not even supposed to be the start of an instruction. It’s smack dab in the middle of the MOVEA.L instruction at 0x40A43B92, which is the instruction that loads A1 with a real address that this code can use for enabling the sound interrupt.</p>



<p>When we jump to 0x40A43B94, we aren’t running intended code anymore. The CPU gets out of sync with the path that the code was designed to follow. 0x0CEC was supposed to be the second half of the MOVEA.L instruction — the address in RAM to load from — but instead, it is being treated as the start of a new instruction.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-13.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="796" height="101" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-13.png 796w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-13-300x38.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-13-768x97.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px"></a></figure>



<p>The CPU doesn’t get back in sync right away. We execute this mystery CAS (compare and swap) instruction, and then an unintended “MOVE.B D0, D4” instruction, before finally reaching a real MOVE.B instruction at 0x40A43B9C — the instruction that crashes. That is the point where the CPU has returned to running code that Apple actually wanted it to run. But unfortunately, A1 contains an invalid address because the code that was supposed to fill it out wasn’t reached, so of course everything crashes when we try to write to A1 + 0x1C00. It all makes sense.</p>



<p>Going back further, A1 gets loaded with the “junk” value of 0xFFFF8FBA as part of the initial jump to InstallSoundIntHandler. So, of course, it’s not really junk. It’s being used as an offset for a jump instruction:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-39.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="795" height="394" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-39.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-39.png 795w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-39-300x149.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-39-768x381.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"></a></figure>



<p>IDA’s disassembly is a little more readable. That value of 0xFFFF8FBA loaded into A1 represents how much you have to add to the program counter in order to reach <em>InstallSoundIntHandler</em> from where you currently are. Interpreting it as signed, it’s a negative number because that function is further back in the ROM code.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-17.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="761" height="59" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-17.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-17.png 761w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-17-300x23.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px"></a></figure>



<p>Overall, I felt that I totally understood what was happening. I’m probably repeating myself, but I just want it to sink in one more time: The problematic value in A1 gets loaded as part of a big relative jump to this section of ROM, and an out-of-bounds table access is jumping past code that is supposed to load A1 with an actual address of a peripheral to configure for sound interrupts. So A1 still contains that negative offset for the jump instead of a real address. Finally, it ends up being used as an address in a write operation, and boom, Sad Mac.</p>



<p>If you’ve followed along with me thus far, I’m sure there are some burning questions on your mind. This explains how MAME fails, but not why. Why was this happening? Also, why didn’t this same failure occur on actual hardware? Obviously, the Classic II wasn’t recalled because of an inability to use 32-bit addressing. There’s no way that happened. It would have been all over tech news. Not to mention the fact that the people actually working on the ROM code would have quickly noticed it while they were testing. It’s kind of a glaring issue.</p>



<p>So what gives? Was MAME doing something wrong here that didn’t match hardware? This code couldn’t have really been reached on hardware, right? I have the answer to these questions, but as a forewarning, the situation is way more complicated than I expected it to be.</p>



<p>I started out by trying to understand what the CAS instruction reached after the out-of-bounds jump was doing. Here are the bytes:</p>



<pre>0C EC 08 A9 00 04</pre>



<p>I quickly noticed that if I changed my disassembly in IDA so that it thought the code was supposed to start there, it refused to disassemble the instruction at all:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-18.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="585" height="106" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-18.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-18.png 585w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-18-300x54.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px"></a></figure>



<p>When I tried to convert it to code starting at 0x40A43B94, it said:</p>



<pre>Command "MakeCode" failed</pre>



<p>GNU objdump also failed to disassemble it, and then got right back in sync with the intended code:</p>



<pre>40a43b94:	0cec           	.short 0x0cec<br>40a43b96:	08a9 0004 1800 	bclr #4,%a1@(6144)<br>40a43b9c:	137c 0090 1c00 	moveb #-112,%a1@(7168)<br>40a43ba2:	4e75           	rts</pre>



<p>The fact that two well-known disassemblers balked at this instruction piqued my curiosity. I decided to use MacsBug on my Macintosh IIci, which also has a 68030 processor, to put all that code into RAM at a random location and see what MacsBug thought about it. Since I was going through all this effort, I also arranged all the other registers to be identical to what I was seeing on MAME. It wasn’t a perfect match with what I was seeing in MAME, though; I had to leave the program counter pointing into RAM instead of ROM.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugbefore3.jpg" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="306" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugbefore3.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugbefore3.jpg 800w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugbefore3-300x115.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugbefore3-768x294.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></figure>



<p>Interesting — MacsBug also said it was a CAS.W instruction, but it interpreted it slightly differently. It said it was CAS.W D1,D2,$0004(A4).</p>



<p>Of course, I couldn’t resist stepping through the code in MacsBug to see what it would do on a real 68030 processor:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugafter3.jpg" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="302" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugafter3.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugafter3.jpg 800w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugafter3-300x113.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/macsbugafter3-768x290.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></figure>



<p>Wait…what? If you compare the register display on the left side of the screen in the first picture with the same display in the second picture, something incredibly strange has happened. Even though MacsBug and MAME both don’t mention A1 in their interpretations of this CAS instruction at all, the value of A1 has changed! It started out as 0xFFFF8FBA, and ended up as 0xFC6B8. It seems to have turned into a value similar to what’s in A5 through A7 — a valid RAM address.</p>



<p>Further tinkering with MacsBug and different register values revealed that the new value of A1 depended on the original value of A1, A7, and the program counter. I couldn’t figure out exactly what it was doing, but it was definitely majorly changing A1’s value.</p>



<p>At this point, I felt like I was onto something. The MAME-emulated Classic II was crashing because A1 didn’t change, so it still contained an invalid address. On hardware, this weird instruction, which several disassemblers refused to touch, and wasn’t even intended to be jumped to because it starts in the middle of an actual valid instruction, was changing A1 to a new value that was a good address. Was this crazy instruction accidentally fixing A1 and thus hiding a bug from Apple’s ROM developers in the early 1990s?</p>



<p>This was about the time that Arbee suggested I <a href="https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/classic-ii-possible-rom-bug-weird-68030-instruction.49071/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start sharing my research on the 68kmla forums</a> and the <a href="https://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=124008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bannister.org forums</a> to see if some of the incredible folks who know way more than me about the 68k instruction set might be able to chime in. I also asked around on IRC in #mac68k on Libera.</p>



<p>The consensus was that this is not a valid CAS instruction, and that MacsBug’s interpretation of the registers being D1 and D2 is correct. Let’s look at what the <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/reference-manual/M68000PRM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Motorola M68000 Family Programmer’s Reference Manual</a> says about the encoding of the CAS instruction:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-20.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="672" height="652" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-20.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-20.png 672w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-20-300x291.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px"></a></figure>



<p>Comparing this with the 3 words of the instruction (0x0CEC 0x08A9 0x0004) and filling in the fields, we can see the following:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BadInstruction-1.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="651" height="105" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BadInstruction-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BadInstruction-1.png 651w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BadInstruction-1-300x48.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px"></a></figure>



<p>The first word appears to be a valid CAS instruction. The second word, though, has a few bits that are 1 even though the instruction format specifically says they are supposed to be 0. I’ve marked them in red. Also, the Du and Dc fields match what MacsBug says, as opposed to how MAME interpreted it.</p>



<p>The third word, 0x0004, is the d16 value mentioned in the MODE field. It’s the $0004 offset from A4. So according to Motorola’s reference manual, this instruction is:</p>





<p>…except it has three bits that are 1 in places where they are supposed to be 0. So it’s not a valid instruction at all. At least, it’s not documented.</p>



<p>Side note: I think MAME’s debugger is also decoding normal CAS instructions incorrectly; if I change it to 0x0CEC 0x0081 0x0004 instead, which is the correct way to write this instruction without the three bad “1” bits, it still thinks Du is D0 instead of D2. But that’s beside the point — the instruction we’re dealing with in this story is completely messed up either way.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAS (compare-and-swap) instruction is an interesting one</a>. It’s used for accomplishing various atomic operations without requiring a lock. It is one of the few instructions in the 68000 family CPUs that perform a read-modify-write bus cycle. What this particular instruction is supposed to do is compare the word value in memory at A4 + 4 to the value of D1. If they are the same, then the value in D2 is written to memory at A4 + 4. Otherwise, the value in memory at A4 + 4 is loaded into D1.</p>



<p>It clearly still does some of this stuff, like the read-modify-write cycle involving A4 + 4. If I change A4 to point to an invalid address, MacsBug complains to me. For example, on my Mac IIci with the same test setup I showed earlier, if I set A4 to 0xFFFF0000 and rerun the bad instruction, MacsBug tells me this:</p>



<pre>Bus Error at 0004CB20<br>while reading word (read-modify-write) from FFFF0004 in Supervisor data space</pre>



<p>This definitely means that this instruction still performs the RMW cycle at A4 + 4. It doesn’t seem to do exactly what the CAS instruction is supposed to do though. Obviously, the normal CAS instruction wouldn’t mess with the value of A1. I ran more tests after changing A4 to point to RAM. If I store the value 0xFFFF at A4 + 4, and D1 is set to 0x1111 and D2 is set to 0x2222, then after executing the instruction, memory at A4 + 4 changes to 0x2222. But that doesn’t really make any sense, because it only should have written 0x2222 to memory if D1 was equal to 0xFFFF.</p>



<p>Let’s summarize what we’ve learned so far.</p>



<ul>
<li>The invalid code that the ROM accidentally jumps to (0x0CEC 0x08A9 0x0004) is sort of like “CAS D1,D2,$0004(A4)”, but not really, because some of the bits that are supposed to be 0 are actually set to 1.</li>



<li>On another 68030-based Mac, I’ve observed that this instruction ends up modifying the value stored in register A1.</li>



<li>MAME’s 68030 CPU emulator does not change A1 like this, because the instruction is undocumented and normal code would never use it.</li>



<li>The Sad Mac in MAME occurs a couple of instructions later because A1 is set to an invalid address, and code in ROM tries to write a byte to A1 + 0x1C00.</li>
</ul>



<p>I was starting to believe something that sounded almost too crazy to be true: Apple had an out-of-bounds jump bug in the Classic II’s ROM that should have caused a Sad Mac during boot, but they had no idea the bug was there because the 68030 was accidentally fixing the value of A1 by executing an undocumented instruction. How could I prove that my theory was correct?</p>



<p>By buying a Classic II and hacking the ROM in order to see exactly what is happening on hardware, of course!</p>

<p>This Classic II was manufactured in 1991, so it’s about 34 years old at this point. Computers this old usually need to be repaired if nobody has already fixed them. As I mentioned in a <a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2024/11/the-capacitor-that-apple-soldered-incorrectly-at-the-factory/" data-type="post" data-id="9225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous post about the LC III capacitor polarization mistake</a>, the surface mount capacitors in old Macs leak out corrosive goo over time. This machine was no exception. I didn’t even try powering it up. I immediately opened it up and removed what I believe was the original Sonnenschein 1/2 AA lithium battery with a March 1991 date code. The battery had not leaked at all, luckily! That’s another unfortunate thing that happens in a lot of old Macs that have been sitting around for decades — severe battery damage.</p>

<p>I don’t want to go into excruciating detail about the repair and make this post even longer to read, but if you’re interested in hearing more about that process, I <a href="https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/classic-ii-possible-rom-bug-weird-68030-instruction.49071/page-3#post-552591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a few updates about the repair in my 68kmla forum thread</a>. I did accidentally short /RESET to ground while soldering in new capacitors, but I eventually got the logic board working. This was very similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8KXPXT4E1U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what happened to Adrian’s Digital Basement on his SE/30 board</a> a few months ago, but lucky for me, my accidental short didn’t involve 12 volts and fry a bunch of chips! Adrian’s channel is an excellent resource for vintage computer enthusiasts out there, if you’re not already subscribed.</p>



<p>The Classic II has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cathode-ray tube</a> for its screen, which scares the crap out of me, so I opted to use a different solution in order to run the logic board by itself without any dangerous voltages. Plus, the analog boards in these computers are known to be a huge pain to repair. This one had really bad capacitor leakage, so that’ll probably be a future repair project. The bottom line is I knew I’d be installing and removing ROM chips a bunch, so I wanted to run the logic board out in the open, for reasons of both safety and convenience. Special thanks to 68kmla forum member davewongillies for <a href="https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/running-a-macse-30-without-an-analog-board.38857/#post-522389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posting his similar setup with a Classic II logic board</a>, complete with Amazon links for a bunch of the parts. That Mini-Fit Jr. pin extractor tool on Amazon is absolute garbage though — I could never get it to work. I ended up using staples instead.</p>

<p>I got impatient while waiting for my RGBtoHDMI to arrive for converting the Classic II’s video signal into HDMI, and eventually discovered <a href="https://github.com/guruthree/mac-se-video-converter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another solution created by GitHub user guruthree</a> involving a Raspberry Pi Pico that converts the signal to VGA. I made a few cables, tweaked the code until the timings and colors were correct, and ended up with this concoction to adapt between a CGA DE-9 video connector and VGA:</p>

<p>Although I would never do anything like this in a real production environment where reliability matters, I didn’t even use level shifters for the 5V signals coming from the Mac. Technically, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/04/05/rp2040-and-5v-logic-best-friends-this-fx9000p-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the RP2040 is “sort of” 5V tolerant</a>, even though it’s not documented in the datasheet. That, combined with the fact that I had a few Picos laying around that I didn’t care about destroying, gave me enough confidence to try it out.</p>



<p>Here’s the whole mess, all wired up together, along with an ATX power supply. I also swapped the original ROM chips out with some programmable SST29EE010 EEPROMs I had on hand. Interestingly, the factory chips from Apple were actually UV-erasable EPROMs, so I could have even used the original chips if I had a UV chip eraser.</p>

<p>I successfully booted from a SCSI drive using this setup, and could capture the video signal with one of my many video capture devices:</p>

<p>By the way, I think there’s something wrong with at least one column of pixels on the left side. I think it has something to do with the tweak I made to the code running on the RP2040 in order to make it sync up correctly with the Classic II’s video signal. I’m sure I could fix it if I played around more. The RGBtoHDMI, which arrived a few days later, does not have this problem.</p>



<p>Anyway, I knew I was in business. I threw together some 68030 assembly code to display the value of A1 on the screen, found an unused place in the ROM to put it, and then came up with three custom ROMs to try on the Classic II:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Custom ROM 1: </strong>Replace the instruction at 0x40A43B9C that results in a Sad Mac (the MOVE.B instruction) with a jump to my special code that draws A1 to the screen, so we can see what A1 is on hardware at that point. Also, this would verify whether this code even runs at all on hardware.</li>



<li><strong>Custom ROM 2: </strong>Replace the instruction at 0x40A43B94 (the CAS instruction) with the same jump to my special code. This would verify whether the out-of-bounds jump was really happening, and what the value of A1 was leading up to it.</li>



<li><strong>Custom ROM 3:</strong> Replace the instruction at 0x40A43B94 (the CAS instruction) with NOPs. This would ideally replicate exactly what I was seeing in MAME, proving that the bad CAS instruction was vital to the Classic II’s ability to boot.</li>
</ul>



<p>Let’s look at the results one by one. Here’s the result that was displayed when I ran Custom ROM 1:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-21.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="509" height="341" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-21.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-21.png 509w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-21-300x201.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px"></a></figure>



<p>This verified that the section of code I was looking at definitely ran on hardware. It also showed that A1 was set to a very interesting value when it reached the instruction that crashed on MAME. 0x40A4BBB2 is not really an address you would write to because it’s a ROM address, but it doesn’t cause a bus error if you attempt it.</p>



<p>Here is what I got when I ran Custom ROM 2:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-22.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="509" height="341" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-22.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-22.png 509w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-22-300x201.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px"></a></figure>



<p>The same A1 value that we saw in MAME! This proved two things. One, the out-of-bounds table jump was definitely happening — if it wasn’t, my custom A1 drawing code wouldn’t have ran at all, since the JMP to it was stored out of sync of the normal intended code flow just like the accidental CAS instruction. Second, it also proved, along with the first test, that the CAS instruction was indeed fixing A1 on hardware, just like I theorized.</p>



<p>Lastly, my test run of Custom ROM 3, which eliminated the CAS instruction from the situation altogether, gave me the final proof I needed:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-23.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="509" height="341" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-23.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-23.png 509w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-23-300x201.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px"></a></figure>



<p>A Sad Mac, just like I saw with MAME in 32-bit mode. I also discovered during this test that on hardware, the same Sad Mac happens in 24-bit mode too. So MAME is actually more tolerant than hardware of that invalid write in 24-bit mode.</p>



<p>These results motivated me to make a couple more hacked ROM images to run on hardware in order to glean the values of all of the CPU’s data and address registers immediately before and after the CAS instruction. The data register values are shown in the left column, address registers in the right column. Before:</p>

<p>And after:</p>

<p>Yep! Everything is the same except for A1, which has magically been transformed from FFFF8FBA to 40A4BBB2. The mystery instruction is definitely what was responsible for that.</p>



<p>One fun part about this test was being able to successfully verify that everything on hardware was exactly identical to what MAME did up to the bad instruction. The entire register state shown in the “before” picture is a perfect match to what MAME shows when booting in 32-bit mode prior to the bad CAS instruction. See for yourself:</p>

<p>If your brain is fried after reading all this, first of all I don’t blame you at all, and second, let me bring everything together to explain what this all means:</p>



<p><strong>I’ve discovered an undocumented MC68030 instruction that performs a read-modify-write bus cycle and also changes the value of the A1 register.</strong></p>



<p>This newly-discovered instruction turns out to be the glue that’s accidentally holding the Classic II together. Without this instruction modifying A1, the Classic II can’t boot. I’m confident that it was a mistake and not something intentional. A totally understandable mistake, at that. If the pesky 68030 hadn’t been hiding the bug from Apple’s ROM developers, there is no doubt they would have caught it before the Classic II shipped. It’s not like they did all of their development work in 24-bit mode!</p>



<p>I searched deeper and found the same chunk of code in the newer Macintosh IIvx ROM, and in that ROM they finally increased the size of the jump table. I confirmed that the case for the Classic II in that code does nothing at all. It just jumps directly to an RTS instruction. I wonder if the Apple ROM developer working on that chunk of code in the IIvx ROM scratched their head in confusion when they added new entries for a bunch of new models, including the Classic II, after the Classic II ROM had already been finalized and shipped. Who knows? I’m not sure how Apple handled all the different ROM variants back then.</p>



<p>Because of this new discovery, I think it’s very likely that there is not a 100% perfect Motorola MC68030 emulator or replica in existence right now. This might be the only case in existence where it matters though. What this means is I could write a small chunk of code that determines whether it’s running on a physical 68030 or an emulator, by simply using that instruction and looking at the resulting value of A1.</p>



<p>What can MAME do in order to work around this problem and allow the Classic II to boot? We don’t really know the exact details of what this instruction does. With some limited testing, I believe I’ve observed that the resulting value of A1 depends on the original A1 value, the value of A7, and the program counter. But I’m not sure. Maybe someone can make a program that tries out a bunch of different register values and memory contents, and attempt to deduce what exactly the instruction does so that it can be emulated accurately. Until someone decides that it’s worth trying to figure out, <a href="https://github.com/mamedev/mame/commit/56af26b77aa5d564cefad4ae2f435ee155b1409d#diff-2ed507da8835078a892501397a58bcd18e52779493b97e3c2d550c52dedce3e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MAME is patching this bug out of the ROM</a> in order to allow the Classic II to boot. As <a href="https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/classic-ii-possible-rom-bug-weird-68030-instruction.49071/page-2#post-551578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arbee pointed out</a>, we’re a little late to get Motorola/Freescale/NXP to issue an errata. Unless someone who worked on the 68030 happens to see this post and might have a clue about what’s going on here…</p>



<p>Here’s a screenshot of MAME with Arbee’s patch applied, now able to successfully emulate a Classic II with 32-bit addressing enabled. Yay!</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-44.png" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="514" height="416" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-44.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-44.png 514w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-44-300x243.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px"></a></figure>



<p>After all that, what’s the lesson we can learn from this story? I guess it’s that emulators can teach us new things about hardware that we never would have thought to look into! I bet this bug in the ROM would have gone undiscovered for all eternity if not for MAME providing emulation of the Classic II, which isn’t a particularly notable machine compared to more popular compact Macs like the SE/30 and Color Classic.</p>



<p>It also goes to show you how bugs can be lurking in the background in places where you might think everything is totally polished. I think it’s also a good example of how some bugs just aren’t that big of a deal. This bug fits that category pretty well. The machine worked fine and nobody noticed.</p>



<p>Oh, and as for the original reason I somehow managed to pull myself into this investigation in the first place: the command+power key combination does not work in MAME. Now that I have a real Classic II, I have been able to confirm that the keystroke does indeed work on hardware. It only works with MacsBug installed, which is likely due to what I said earlier about the Egret disabling it by default. Either way, it really should work in MAME when MacsBug is installed. I suppose that’s another MAME fix for me to work on!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>“Anomalous”, “glitch”, or “unspeakable” tokens in an LLM are those that induce bizarre behavior or otherwise don’t behave like regular text.</p><p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">SolidGoldMagikarp saga</a><span> is pretty much essential context, as it documents the discovery of this phenomenon in GPT-2 and GPT-3.</span></p><p>But, as far as I was able to tell, nobody had yet attempted to search for these tokens in DeepSeek-V3, so I tried doing exactly that. Being a SOTA base model, open source, and an all-around strange LLM, it seemed like a perfect candidate for this.</p><p>This is a catalog of the glitch tokens I've found in DeepSeek after a day or so of experimentation, along with some preliminary observations about their behavior.</p><p><span>Note: </span><em>I’ll be using “DeepSeek” as a generic term for V3 and r1.</em></p><p>I searched for these tokens by first extracting the vocabulary from DeepSeek-V3's tokenizer, and then automatically testing every one of them for unusual behavior.</p><p><span>Note: </span><em>For our purposes, r1 is effectively a layer on top of V3, and all anomalous tokens carry over. The distillations, on the other hand, are much more fundamentally similar to the pre-trains they're based on, so they will not be discussed.</em></p><p>The most obvious thing differentiating DeepSeek’s tokenizer from other’s is a substantial fraction of the training data being Chinese. This makes things much more difficult to work with — tokenizations are learned at the byte level, but UTF-8 Chinese characters are usually several bytes long. They end up split at inconsistent positions, cutting characters in half, and making most of it impossible to decode. Because of this, about half the vocabulary looked like the following:</p><pre><code><code>ä¸į æĸ¹ä¾¿
ä½ł æ²¡æľī
à¦¨ à¦¿
äººåĳĺ åľ¨</code></code></pre><p>To get rid of these, I pretty aggressively filtered out nonstandard characters, cutting the vocabulary size down from 128000 to 70698. I'm sure there's a lot worth exploring going on in those tokens, but I pretty quickly decided that I’d rather not stare at Chinese and broken Unicode for hours on end.</p><p><span>Next, I ran every single one of these tokens through DeepSeek's chat API twice, and automatically saved all of them that behaved unexpectedly. (</span><em>Much credit is due to DeepSeek for making this process dirt cheap and not imposing any sort of rate limiting.</em><span>)</span></p><p>In both runs, I asked DeepSeek-V3 to simply repeat the given token, albeit with slightly different formatting to avoid missing anything. Glitch tokens can be identified by the model’s inability to perform this task:</p><pre><code><code>System: Repeat the requested string and nothing else.
User: Repeat the following: "{token}"</code></code></pre><pre><code><code>System: Say the requested string, exactly as it is written, and nothing else.
User: Say the following: "{token}"</code></code></pre><p>After that, I had to sift through the massive set of tokens which were repeated by the model as something non-trivially different.</p><p>I first manually filtered out uninteresting samples (V3 adding escape backslashes, extra or removed spaces, refusals on slurs, etc), and then clustered them into some rough groupings based on their initial appearance. From there, I started exploring them individually.</p><p><span>Note: </span><em>When trying any of these out, pay close attention to whitespace — </em><span>'XXXX'</span><em> and </em><span>' XXXX'</span><em><span> are different tokens. The official </span><a href="https://chat.deepseek.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">DeepSeek chat interface</a><span> strips whitespace padding.</span></em></p><p>Many of the tokens appear unspeakable on their own, as they're only ever seen in the context of some larger string. This is the simplest and most explainable category.</p><p>"Fragment tokens" aren't too surprising to find in a large vocabulary, but I suspect there's still enough interesting behavior to be worth eventually examining more closely. They usually behave like the following:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09dfb3ec-8b98-4a80-bfa1-5440846b7a24_1334x401.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09dfb3ec-8b98-4a80-bfa1-5440846b7a24_1334x401.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09dfb3ec-8b98-4a80-bfa1-5440846b7a24_1334x401.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09dfb3ec-8b98-4a80-bfa1-5440846b7a24_1334x401.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09dfb3ec-8b98-4a80-bfa1-5440846b7a24_1334x401.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09dfb3ec-8b98-4a80-bfa1-5440846b7a24_1334x401.png" width="1334" height="401" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/09dfb3ec-8b98-4a80-bfa1-5440846b7a24_1334x401.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:401,&quot;width&quot;:1334,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Pasted image 20250124125105.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="Pasted image 20250124125105.png" title="Pasted image 20250124125105.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09dfb3ec-8b98-4a80-bfa1-5440846b7a24_1334x401.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09dfb3ec-8b98-4a80-bfa1-5440846b7a24_1334x401.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09dfb3ec-8b98-4a80-bfa1-5440846b7a24_1334x401.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09dfb3ec-8b98-4a80-bfa1-5440846b7a24_1334x401.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Here's a few other examples:</p><pre><code><code>CHANTABILITY -&gt; MERCHANTABILITY

This immediately caught my eye, and was the first token I examined a bit closer.</p><pre><code><code>Prompt: Say Nameeee (And variations of that prompt)
Images: ↑, ��, 🗣️, ⟩⟩, MR, 🖉, ►▼</code></code></pre><p>When given context clues, ' Nameeee' is more likely to be read as a word. Sometimes the substitute makes sense contextually, other times it seems extremely arbitrary:</p><pre><code><code>Prompt: Who is John Nameeee?
Images: John McCain, John MP3, John Wikisource, John the Baptist, John †, John ██████
</code></code></pre><pre><code><code>Prompt: What's Nameeee plus Nameeee?
Images: ¼ plus ¼, [Math Processing Error] plus [Math Processing Error], one plus one</code></code></pre><p>The API needs to be used to send ' Nameeee' on its own (due to the whitespace), but when alone, it's identified as short broken ASCII sequences like '{{', or seemingly random choices like 'Mughal'.</p><p>r1 occasionally reads ' Nameeee' as special tokens such as '&lt;｜end▁of▁thinking｜&gt;', which results in the COT breaking and r1 entering a confused state. We'll see this kind of thing happen often.</p><p>As for the origin of this token, I have no idea yet. Determining the causes behind these glitches is a much more involved endeavor, and identifying them is only the first step.</p><p>There's another token, 'EDMFunc', which tends to behave similarly to ' Nameeee', and shares some of the same weird images (like '►▼'). Otherwise, it has a preference for words starting with "H" and Japanese names.</p><p>Interestingly, ' FullEDMFunc' is a separate anomalous token. Usually, the image only replaces the 'EDMFunc' substring, leaving 'Full' intact:</p><pre><code><code>Prompt: Say FullEDMFunc (And variations of that prompt)
Images: FullMesh, FullMoon, FullDisclosure, Fully Mapped Function, Full Machine Translation</code></code></pre><p><span>the </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.metadata.edm.edmfunction?view=netframework-4.8.1" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">EdmFunction class</a><span> class in the .NET framework is the only plausible source I've found so far.</span></p><p>' everydaycalculation' usually has images in the vibe-cluster of math education utilities, such as 'percentcalc', 'FractionCal', 'youtube', or 'VisualFractions'.</p><p>' numbersaplenty' seems to be in a similar cluster as ' everydaycalculation', sharing common images such as 'VisualFractions' or 'Numbermatics'. Interestingly, r1 often associates it with thousand-related ideas, like "millennia".</p><p>'SetSavedPoint', while sometimes read correctly, most often has images that occur in context of Unity, like 'SetValue' or 'SerializeField'.</p><p>' CategoryTreeLabel' will often end up as 'Categorize', but other times as non-English words such as 'Kaagapay' (Filipino) and 'καταλογείς' (Greek).</p><p>A few tokens exist in something of a middle ground, not being entirely unspeakable, but otherwise still leading to strange behavior and confusion. ' MentionsView' sometimes ends up as syntactically similar words like 'Mendeley' or 'Viewfinder', sometimes itself, and sometimes nothing at all. r1 often changes its mind about what the token is, repeatedly contradicting itself. ' mediefiler' and 'HasColumnType' also fall into this class.</p><p>When r1 is prompted with most of the above tokens on their own, it breaks in one of two modes.</p><ol><li><p>It'll hallucinate a

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://iamwillwang.com/dollar/every-html-element/">https://iamwillwang.com/dollar/every-html-element/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42823722">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>
There are over a hundred HTML elements. This page uses all of them.
        You're looking at &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; right now.
</p> <hgroup> <h2>HTML loves text. We can get some huge text with &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;.</h2> <h2>Or smaller with &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</h2> <h3>And so on...</h3> <h4>And so on...</h4> <h5>And so on...</h5> <h6>
And... nope that's it for headings. These are all in an &lt;hgroup&gt;&lt;/hgroup&gt; by the way.
</h6> </hgroup> <pre>      Some text is &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;-formatted. Just a different look.
    </pre> <ul>
We can make a list with &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; <li>and</li> <li>some</li> <li>&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;s</li> </ul> <ol>
Or a numbered list with &lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; <li>and</li> <li>some</li> <li>&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;s</li> </ol> <dl>
Or even a description list with &lt;dl&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;.
<dt>It</dt> <dt>holds</dt> <dt>description terms, &lt;dt&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;</dt> <dd> and description definitions, &lt;dd&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;. </dd> </dl> <menu> &lt;menu&gt;&lt;/menu&gt; is also a list. But it's the same as &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;.
</menu> <blockquote> &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; indents text. How credible!
</blockquote> <q>&lt;q&gt;&lt;/q&gt; is block's little brother.</q> <figure>
Here's a &lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;... It usually contains some other media
        (like an image).
<img src="https://iamwillwang.com/_astro/figure.o8SCE8C_.png" alt="figure" width="363.3333333333333" height="32.666666666666664"> <figcaption>
and this &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt; can then describe said media.
</figcaption> </figure>
And we can take a break with &lt;hr /&gt;. <hr>
We <strong>can</strong>
get a lot <em>fancier</em> with text <mark>of course</mark> with elements like
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;mark&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;.
<p> <b>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; bolds</b> </p> <p> <i>&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; italicizes</i> </p> <p> <u>&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt; underlines</u> </p> <p> <small>&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is small </small> </p> <p> &lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; <sub>subscripts</sub> </p> <p> &lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; <sup>superscripts</sup> </p> <p> <s>&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt; is for marking text as accurate</s>... err never mind
</p> <p> <ins>&lt;ins&gt;&lt;/ins&gt; marks text as inserted</ins> </p> <p> <del>&lt;del&gt;&lt;/del&gt; marks text as deleted</del> </p> <p> <bdi> &lt;bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt; is for isolating text that may flow in a different direction
          than surrounding text: ex. محمد.
</bdi> </p> <p> &lt;bdo&gt;&lt;/bdo&gt; <bdo dir="rtl">
is for overriding the direction of text: ex. محمد.
</bdo> </p> <p>   
Ah, now there's some breathing room, thanks to &lt;br /&gt;.
</p><p> <cite>You can &lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; this website as Every HTML Element.</cite> <code>And this whole thing is &lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;,</code>
living on the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>.
</p> <data value="123">Ignore &lt;data&gt;&lt;/data&gt;. That's more for the machines.</data> <time datetime="2025-01-23">&lt;time&gt;&lt;/time&gt; too. It's 10:35 PM right now.</time> <p>  
That sense of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> might all be in your head. Well, actually it's
      in &lt;kbd&gt;.
</p><p> <dfn>This</dfn> is defined. And <var>this</var> is a &lt;var&gt;&lt;/var&gt;iable.
</p> <p>
How bout some hidden gems?
<ruby>
漢 <rp>(</rp><rt>かん</rt><rp>)</rp> </ruby> </p> <samp>Here's a taste of a &lt;samp&gt;&lt;/samp&gt;</samp> <p> <span>&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; doesn't do much alone. But who can?</span> </p> <p>
Here's an opportunity for a break &lt;wbr/&gt;.
<wbr>
The browser will decide when to take it.
</p> <hr>
All this text... where does it live? Well we're inside the &lt;main&gt;&lt;/main&gt; &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
of an &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt; document. There's a &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; here with us
      too. The
&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; thinks about things like &lt;link&gt;s to other things, &lt;meta&gt;data, our &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;, and our &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;.
<header> <p>
A &lt;header&gt;&lt;/header&gt; is different than the head. It's for content.
</p> </header>  <section> <article> <p>
By this point, I think it's clear that HTML elements run the gamut
            from content to container to logic to edge case. Some elements we
            can see, others not so much. Some elements are meant to combine with
            others. Some elements are only meant for your browser to read. Some
            elements had good intentions but never picked up mainstream use.
</p>  </article> <nav>
If you're getting a bit lost, &lt;nav&gt;&lt;/nav&gt; can help you
<a href="#">find</a> <a href="#">the</a> <a href="#">way</a> </nav> <address>
Or maybe an &lt;address&gt;&lt;/address&gt; would be better?
</address> <br>
That concludes this section.
</section> <hr> <p>HTML is more than text.</p> <map name="map"> <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,300,100" href="#first" alt="area"> <area shape="rect" coords="300,0,600,100" href="#second" alt="area"> </map> <img src="https://iamwillwang.com/_astro/map.ZvQu5ZE9.png" alt="figure" usemap="#map" width="600"> <div> <p>
Sometimes it's more fun to listen than read. This is the sound of the
          website being made.

That concludes our journey! I lied a bit at the beginning. There are
        more elements than this: experimental ones, deprecated ones, web
        components, hydrogen, oxygen, and so on. Regardless, I hope this text
        got you a little hyper because, mark my words, you're speaking a new
        language now.

            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Emotional support networks among men shrink by 50% between the ages of 30 and 90, reflecting an average decrease from two to one emotional support providers, according to research published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/pag0000843"><em>Psychology &amp; Aging</em></a>.</p><p>Research consistently shows that social networks tend to <a href="https://www.psypost.org/loneliness-follows-a-u-shaped-path-across-adulthood-study-finds/">shrink with age</a>. Emotional support, defined as providing comfort and understanding, is essential for well-being, particularly in older adults, where it predicts <a href="https://www.psypost.org/loneliness-linked-to-cognitive-decline-in-older-adults-study-finds/">better cognitive health</a>, emotional stability, and life expectancy. Past studies demonstrate that general social network contraction occurs globally and across genders. However, whether the decline extends to the most intimate forms of support is debated.</p><p>Motivated by frameworks like socioemotional selectivity theory, which proposes that older adults strategically prioritize close relationships, and theories emphasizing emotional independence with age, Kate Petrova and colleagues aimed to clarify how emotional support networks evolve and identify early predictors of their size.</p><p>This study utilized a unique longitudinal dataset drawn from a sample of 235 men who were originally recruited as Harvard University students between 1939 and 1942. These participants were followed for 71 years, with data collected at regular intervals to assess changes in their emotional support networks. Emotional support was defined as the number of people participants turned to for comfort and counsel during challenging times. Data collection involved seven waves of emotional support assessments conducted between 1951 and 2010.</p><p>Participants were asked open-ended questions about their emotional support providers, such as “Who do you turn to for emotional support?” or “With whom do you usually talk over personal problems?” The total number of support providers was calculated based on participants’ responses. However, generalized responses, such as “family” or “friends,” as well as mentions of non-human sources like pets, were excluded from formal analyses.</p><p>The study also examined early-life predictors of network size. Archival data from participants’ intake interviews in the late 1930s and early 1940s provided information about childhood family environments, including parental warmth and socioeconomic status (SES). Parental warmth was measured using coders’ ratings of the participants’ relationships with their mother and father, as well as the overall emotional climate of their home. Childhood SES was assessed using parental education and income levels. Life transitions, such as marriage and retirement, were also considered in the analysis, with data collected about participants’ marital and employment statuses throughout the study.</p><p>This comprehensive, longitudinal approach allowed the researchers to examine how emotional support networks changed over time and the factors that influenced these changes.</p><p>Petrova and colleagues found that emotional support networks declined significantly across the adult lifespan, with participants’ reported number of emotional support providers decreasing by approximately 50% between the ages of 30 and 90. At age 30, participants reported relying on an average of two support providers, which decreased to just one by age 90. This linear decline suggests that aging is accompanied by a reduction in the number of people individuals regularly turn to for emotional support. Interestingly, this decline was consistent across participants, indicating that the trajectory of network shrinkage was a shared experience within this cohort.</p><p>Results also highlighted the impact of specific life transitions on emotional support networks. Participants’ networks were smaller during periods when they were married, suggesting a consolidation of emotional reliance on their spouse. However, retirement did not appear to influence the number of emotional support providers.</p><p>The study also revealed that early-life experiences played a critical role in shaping network size. Participants who grew up in warmer family environments—characterized by supportive and nurturing relationships with parents—had larger emotional support networks in adulthood. In contrast, childhood SES, as measured by parental income and education, did not predict later-life network size.</p><p>These results emphasize the enduring influence of early family dynamics on socioemotional development, even as other life transitions occur throughout adulthood.</p><p>This research was limited by its all-male, predominantly White sample and its reliance on self-reported data. Additionally, the quality of emotional support and its impacts on well-being were not assessed.</p><p>The study, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/pag0000843">Emotional support across adulthood: A 60-year study of men’s social networks</a>,” was authored by Kate Petrova, Michael D. Nevarez, Robert J. Waldinger, and Marc S. Schulz.</p></div></div>]]></description>

If you were looking to identify functions to cut, people to cut, having an HR director there and having a lawyer say ‘here's what we're allowed to do or not do’ would be one way that you would facilitate that,” says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, noting that DOGE’s potential access to federal employee data could put “them in some sort of crosshairs to be fired.”</p><p>When Musk took over Twitter, he brought in outside help from his <a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/technology/elon-musk-twitter-control.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/technology/elon-musk-twitter-control.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/technology/elon-musk-twitter-control.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">close circle as well as his other companies</a> to transform the company, a <a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-government-trump.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-government-trump.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-government-trump.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">move he appears to be repeating</a>.</p><p>Who exactly is going to be part of DOGE is a particularly thorny issue, because there are technically two DOGEs. One is the permanent organization, the revamped USDS—now the US DOGE Service. The other is a temporary organization, with a termination date of July 4, 2026. Creating this organization means the temporary DOGE can operate under a special set of rules. It can sequester employees from other parts of the government and can accept people <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/3161">who want to work for the government as volunteers</a>. Temporary organizations can also hire what are known as special government employees—experts in a given field who can bypass the rigors of the regular federal hiring processes. They’re also not subject to the same transparency requirements as other government employees.</p><p>In the best-case scenario, this would allow DOGE to move quickly to address issues and fast-track necessary talent, as well as build systems that make government services more seamless by facilitating the flow of information and data. But in the worst case, this could mean less transparency around the interests of people working on important government projects, while enabling possible surveillance.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“I think part of the reason they're wanting to use special government employees is because so long as they all work less than 60 days, the financial reporting requirements are less, which is going to be attractive to billionaires who have a lot of financial things they don't want to disclose,” says Nick Bednar, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota School of Law. “And with agency approval, these individuals are allowed to continue contracting with the federal government if they represent, say, a corporation that has a lot of contracts with the government.”</p><p>Musk alone has over <a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-agencies-contracts.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-agencies-contracts.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-agencies-contracts.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">received billions of dollars</a> via contracts with the federal government through his company SpaceX.</p><p>“To me, [the temporary organization] suggests there's some sort of, there's some reason for that which probably has to do with skirting disclosure and conflicts of interest requirements,” claims Moynihan.</p><p>Noah Kunin, former infrastructure director at the US General Services Administration, tells WIRED that “the government has access to incredible amounts of sensitive or proprietary business information that [businesses] had to share with the government in order to get a contract or take some action.” And while not everyone gets to access this—it generally requires some form of clearance, and government employees are not supposed to share it—this kind of information could be particularly useful to someone like Musk or other members of the business community who might be brought into DOGE.</p><p>“You always have concerns whenever you have private sector individuals entering government for a temporary position,” says Bednar. “This is how regulatory capture occurs.”</p><p>Even with all these special maneuvers, DOGE will likely still face hurdles. Sharing data across government departments and systems is tricky, particularly when different laws govern different agencies and the information they collect. Similarly, sensitive data often requires some form of government authorization, which DOGE volunteers and employees might not be able to get.</p><p>“There are legal restrictions to sharing data between organizations, and those agreements take an enormous amount of effort to put into place,” the former USDS employee says. “There are tons of examples of obstacles to information sharing like that. So maybe this is more aspirational than it is possible.”</p><p>“DOGE has just sort of added this element of unpredictability to what happens next in government,” says Moynihan. “It could be a bipartisan effort to make government technology work better. It could be an oligarch extracting resources from the government. We just really don't know. We're all gazing at tea leaves right now.”</p><p><em>Updated 1/24/2024, 12:26 pm EST: This story has been updated to reflect the reasons why a source was granted anonymity.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

    <p>,
        <time datetime="2025-01-23" itemprop="datePublished">23 January 2025 (in summary), 25 January 2025 (in detail) and 26 January 2025 (with links).</time>.

<p>Buying an old and neglected house in Leeds and working on its renovation for two years has increased and broadened my podcast listening. A series that has provided the soundtrack to stripping the stairs and priming the window frames has been <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/">Conversations with Tyler</a>.</p>
<p>For a decade, American economist Tyler Cowen has interviewed people on a wide range of topics. There is a heavy skew — especially in the episodes I select to consume — towards America and Britain and towards discussion of economics and prosperity. The episodes are fast-paced and Tyler’s questions are well-prepared and incisive.</p>
    <p>This blog post is split into two parts. A summary and a detailed expansion. Links to blog posts, references, and episodes of Conversations with Tyler will be added in the coming days.</p>
<h2>In summary</h2>
<p>In at least six Conversations with Tyler, Tyler Cowen asks his interviewee why they think North England is poor. I don’t think he gets good enough answers, which I guess is why he keeps asking.</p>
<p>So here is a better explanation of why North England is poor with a bonus explanation of why so many Britons think much less of Margaret Thatcher’s Premiership than he and his guests do. It is a heavily simplified and selective story, but I think it tells the key parts of how North England fell from being the birthplace of the industrial revolution and among the richest places in the world two centuries ago to being an economy substantially lagging everywhere else in Northern Europe today.</p>
<p>The North’s economic decline is made even clearer when it is compared to two near neighbours and far more prosperous counterfactuals. Scotland and Ireland, who have achieved greater independence within and from the United Kingdom, and whose success is awkwardly ignored and denied by the people responsible for the North’s decline, are today far stronger economies than North England.</p>
<p>I will publish my expansion of these points in detail as soon as I can, but for now I offer this summary,</p>
<h4>1. The Norman conquest.</h4>
<p>Since at least 1066, England has been ruled from the South East for the benefit of those who rule it and the places where they live and work.</p>
    <h4>2. Ban on Northern universities.</h4>
<p>In the 1600’s, and for two centuries after, England and then Britain’s overwhelmingly and disproportionately Southern Parliament in Westminster rejected North English requests to establish universities in the North. The outsized influence of members representing Oxford and Cambridge and graduates of their universities played a big role in this. The Parliamentarian victory in the English civil war was working on the problem but the Monarchy was restored before Northern universities were established.</p>
<h4>3. The industrial revolution.</h4>
<p>The lack of universities in North England meant that the industrial revolution was heavily powered by Scottish science and largely occurred at a distance, both geographically and culturally, from London and Westminster. It was this distance that allowed North England to prosper through industry, despite constant effort by British national institutions in South East England to constrain their success. And it was the competition of ideas across that distance that led to great Northern social ideas such as Manchester Liberalism, an end to the Corn Laws and more free trade, professional sports, and a fairer democracy eventually triumphing nationally.</p>
<h4>4. Universities were allowed too late.</h4>
<p>North English universities, although quickly successful once they existed, were permitted too late (1880 for Manchester). They could not quickly enough achieve a critical mass of high-skill and elite institutions in North England that would help the economy to retain a technological advantage or transition to higher productivity service activities when Britain’s industrial advantage started to decline.</p>
<h4>5. Grouping, nationalisation, and privatisation destroyed the North's institutions.</h4>
<p>North England’s strongest local institutions were born of the industrial revolution and included the railways and the municipal corporations. Alongside wealthy local industrialists, municipal corporations built and municipalised gas, electricity, and water networks, healthcare, education, and social housing systems and much more. These service and assets were taken out of local control and run overwhelmingly from Westminster as they were grouped, nationalised, and privatised by UK governments of both left and right from the 1920s onward.</p>
<h4>6. Thatcher and the end of competition of power.</h4>
<p>The process of transferring assets and power from local government to central government or to the private sector (regulated by central government) was substantially completed under Thatcher. Major changes included the abolition of metropolitan counties in the North’s great cities, the removal of most remaining local taxation powers, the removal from local control of the Mechanics’ Institutes and Polytechnics (the North’s locally-created alternative to the Universities they were denied during the early industrial revolution), the privatisation and deregulation of local bus services, and the introduction of right-to-buy forcing local governments to sell their largest asset base and source of income at well below market rates and give a portion of the proceeds to the central government.</p><p>Absent any of the protections against it that exist in the US constitution, Thatcher <a href="https://x.com/thomasforth/status/1272993033391427585">moved the British state past the French state into being the most centralised in the developed world</a>. "You can just do things" is an emerging meme in the pro-growth community in London, but since Thatcher that has been largely untrue in North England. Most of the time, someone from central government will block you, if you succeed they will try and stop you, and if you continue succeeding they will subsidise your competitors.</p>
<h4>7. Ultra-centralisation of the state.</h4>
<p>Since Thatcher there has been no effective local counterbalance within England to the UK government’s power held in Westminster, no right for cities or regions within England to raise taxes to fund investment in growth, and no limit on the power of the UK central government to constrain growth in the North. The UK central government, backed by Britain’s national institutions, has intensified its preference for South East England. Britain’s government and institutions have moved Britain’s science and innovation from the rest of the country to the South East, focused on London, Oxford and Cambridge.</p><p>The central government, holding the monopoly power on such investment, has invested heavily in transport infrastructure in, around, and to London and almost nowhere else in England. The development of a competitive agglomeration to London in North England has been deliberately constrained almost continually. These patterns have deepened even while central governments claim to be focusing on regional investment. In the last fifteen years, while the UK government has claimed to be moving power out of Westminster it has <a href="https://tomforth.co.uk/stillnottrying/">centralised its civil service, centralised its investments in R&amp;D and transport infrastructure, and moved an extra million employees from local government control to central government control</a>.</p>
<h4>8. A new generation of policy thinkers.</h4>
<p>A new generation of British national policy thinkers, policy advisors, politicians, and custodians of Britain’s national institutions now live almost none of their lives outside of South East England. They rarely have a memory of, or interest in, an England that is not ruled overwhelmingly from the centre.</p><p>While arguing for growth today these people and their organisations repeat the mistakes that Thatcher cemented in British political economy thinking that a well-managed central monopoly on power is better than a competitive dispersal of power. They celebrate new scientific institutions in London such as ARIA that repeat — against <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/the-missing-4-billion/">strong evidence that it will not deliver greater returns</a> in doing so — the centralisation in the South East of England of our national research capacity.</p><p>We are repeating today previous disasters for the North’s economy such as <a href="https://x.com/jon_agar/status/1591841161068568579?lang=en-GB">the relocation of Britain’s synchrotron to Oxford</a>, the relocation of AstraZeneca to Cambridge and London, and the centralisation of biomedical research in South East England with <a href="https://x.com/thomasforth/status/1633554594939781120">the construction of The Crick Institute</a>. Our institutions celebrate the creation of new "national" organisations in the South East such as The Open Data Institute, Nesta, GDS, Tech City, and the AI Safety Institute that employ large numbers of well-paid people in the capital. At best these organisations allocate their money with preference to South East England and represent local interests as national objectives. At worst they actively oppose and shut down success elsewhere in the country.</p><p>This all happens largely without malice, though prejudice against people from "the regions", while greatly reduced, remains rife within British high society. It is the result of England having forgotten, and — embarrassed by the comparative success of Ireland and Scotland having rejected this centralisation — not having taken the opportunity to remind themselves of the power of competition and markets in government.</p>
<h4>9. Why Britain can't afford to carry on as it is.</h4>
    <p>I have now spent the best part of two decades helping to build successful businesses and organisations in North England. Organisations and companies that I help run and work for consistently beat competitors in the South East who benefit from the support of a generous and powerful central government biased towards their success and not mine. And despite the gloom in this piece, I retain some optimism that things can improve and that continuing to make the case for that improvement is worthwhile.</p><p>Limited success such as in Manchester, whose economy has <a href="https://tomforth.co.uk/humancapital/">nearly kept up with East German cities while the rest of North England falls behind</a>, shows that strong local leadership can convince the British state to treat the North less badly. And we see that given even slightly reduced dispreference from the centre, or a release of constraints on growth from the centre, the North can do well.</p><p>I also know that the North cannot be ignored. The British state cannot afford the large and increasing fiscal transfers needed to maintain national public services which the South demands in a North whose economy is so weak. There are simple and proven actions that would change the trajectory of Northern growth and boost British prosperity. I have faith that the British government and institutions in the South East of England will do the right thing once they can no longer afford not to.</p>


<h2>In detail</h2>
<p>I begin with two apologies.</p>
<p>First, I am sorry to the people of South England. I know from giving talks on these subjects and having written about these issues before that many of you take personal offence to what I mean overwhelmingly as institutional criticism. If I included all the important caveats like “there is of course poverty in the South too, just as there are pockets of prosperity in the North” and “the standard of living is hardly higher in the South given high house prices” and “it’s not as if any more than a handful of people of the South were electing the Southern MPs and Lords” at every position where they would diffuse upset, this essay would be ten thousand words not seven thousand. I am sorry, and I hope you see that I am writing on the advice of Ice T to not hate the player, but instead hate the game.</p>
<p>Second, I apologize in advance for the geographical crime I’m about to commit. I am going to draw a line from the Wash to the Severn and annexe the industrial Midlands of England in the name of the North.</p>
<p>We already speak alike and <a href="https://tandlemanbeerblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/great-divide.html">serve our beer in the same way</a> and I think we are close allies on these issues.</p>
    <figure><img src="https://tomforth.co.uk/whynorthenglandispoor/1_TrapBathSplit.jpeg">
        <figcaption>England's North-South divide is disputed and can be defined in hundreds of ways, but the way we speak is a pretty good one. This is the definition I will use from now on.</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>But having lived in Birmingham for nearly four years I understand the pain it will cause in that city, in Coventry, and in the Black Country to be lumped in with us. I apologise additionally to the people of Nottingham, Derby, and Leicester.</p>
<p>When Tyler talks about why North England is poor he is including you with us and indeed much of our story is shared. The missed opportunity for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Society_of_Birmingham">The Lunar Society</a> to become a cherished national institution merits its own blog post, but it should be written by someone in Birmingham, not me.</p>
<h3>Poorer than Poland.</h3>
<p>I’ve written dozens of blog posts over many years detailing the economic underperformance of North England, how the UK government perpetuates that underperformance, how in similar circumstances <a href="https://tomforth.co.uk/unreasonablesuccess/">Scotland</a>, <a href="https://tomforth.co.uk/northernlands/">the Netherlands</a>, and <a href="https://tomforth.co.uk/furthernorth/">two similar parts of Germany</a> have done much better.</p>
<p>The graph below is to remind us of that context.</p>
    <figure><img src="https://tomforth.co.uk/whynorthenglandispoor/2_NorthEnglandFallsBehind.png">
        <figcaption>North England's economic perfromance since the 1990's has been awful, with almost no growth in GDP/capita. It has been caught up by Poland, been overtaken by East Germany, and fallen well behind the rest of North West Europe.</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>North England was 120 years ago just about the richest place in the world. Today it is very poor by North European standards. If it didn’t receive such generous transfers from England’s prosperous South East (the regions containing Oxford, Cambridge, and London) it would be even poorer still. The primary economy of this North, especially its cities, is astonishingly weak and has long been painfully slow growing.</p>
<p><a href="https://tomforth.co.uk/humancapital/">East Germany overtook us over a decade ago</a>, Poland probably overtook us in the last couple of years, though weak regional data within England and our decision to leave Eurostat following Brexit make it hard to know. The challenges of purchasing power parities, especially when applied to regional economies, especially when large fiscal transfers are involved, will leave it arguable for at least a decade.</p>
<p>I do not want to only describe the problem. I also propose solutions. They are largely unchanged in two decades since I started writing on this topic and are unchanged for many more decades in the writings of dozens of other North Englanders. Britain’s government has just never tried them, while bizarrely protesting that it has.</p>
<p>My three steps for how North England could grow the strength of its economy by somewhere between the 20% above trend it would need to equal Scotland or East Germany and keep up with Poland, the 40% above trend it would need to equal North Rhine Westphalia, its most similar post-industrial region in Germany, or the 60% above trend it would need to equal the Netherlands remain simple.</p>
<ol>
<li>Shift UK national public infrastructure investment to urban North England where it will generate higher national returns by joining up the North into a collection of functioning agglomerations.</li>
<li>Shift UK national public R&amp;D spending to North England where it will more closely match the distribution of private sector spend and drive a new wave of British innovation and growth, especially in the private sector.</li>
<li>Decentralise or relocate government and power within the UK. Ideally this would happen by shrinking the central government and returning tax and spend powers to local and regional governments so that they could lead on requirements 1 and 2. But since this is so deeply and emotionally unacceptable to so many South East British conservatives we may have to do it by moving much of the central government North.</li>
</ol>
<p>In many other blog posts I have shown how the data does not support common excuses for North English underachievement such as poor education, poor health and low genetic IQs (astonishingly this remains an acceptable topic of discussion in polite company and published science in much of Britain) — what Tyler refers to in his interviews as “a human capital crisis”.</p>
<p>Another excuse for North English underachievement I often hear is that the North is too disperse, has no large cities, and what cities it does have are too low density to achieve agglomeration benefits. I have built a number of tools to show that this is not consistent with the data.</p>
<p>The most promising area for North English growth is a 100km radius circle containing five major metropolitan areas with similar populations and populations densities to cities like Amsterdam and a total of 20 million people.</p>
    <figure><img src="https://tomforth.co.uk/whynorthenglandispoor/3_RedCircleBlueCircle.jpg">
        <figcaption>North England's urban core is the second largest such region in Europe. It should be a high density functioning collection of agglomerations, though the UK government has stopped it from becoming one. Data from <a href="https://tomforth.co.uk/passengerflows/">this tool</a>, based on my <a href="https://tomforth.co.uk/circlepopulations/">global population around a point tool</a>.</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>This red circle has the same population as the most expansive definition of London and its commuter zone but its economy is barely half the size. There is no denser circle of population in Europe except London. Only New York, Los Angeles, and Mexico City top it in North America. This is a dense urban concentration that could easily be a functioning collection of agglomerations.</p>
    <p>Using this and <a href="https://tomforth.co.uk/circlepopulations/">other tools</a> we can see that the North’s cities are not small, either individually or in sum. Nor are they low density, except in as much as awful transport infrastructure makes them extremely difficult to travel within and between. In addition to showing that human capital is not the major barrier to North English economic growth, <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/publications/awp/awp198">fantastic work by Anna Stansbury at MIT has shown this convincingly</a>, building on my earlier work. It is no surprise that Anna has achieved greater insight into North English economic underperformance outside of Britain than within it. I find that Tyler, similarly, shows more insight than most people who live and work in South East England.</p>
<h3>Why is the North poor?</h3>
<p>I love Tyler’s question, and I don’t think he’s yet got a good answer.</p>
<p>That’s partly because, on his podcast at least, he’s not asked any of the 25 million people of North England. There is almost no-one in the blue circle who has a good answer, no matter how much they protest that they do or how relevant a third of them think that the eighteen years they spent growing up in the North England leaves them qualified to comment on its future now that they have left. And it’s partly because the answer is quite an expensive one to give in terms of status, income, and perception by those close to the large and growing British state and its national institutions.</p>
<p>Northerners with a good answer for Tyler and wishing to avoid looking too conspiratorial will avoid talking too honestly, too seriously, and in too much detail about the root causes of why the North is poor.</p>
<p>But I run my own businesses from which I can’t easily be fired (though plenty try), we’re doing well and growing quickly, and I don’t need an academic position, a job reference, an event invite, or a show on national radio. I can afford to write pretty much what I like.</p>
<p>So here’s a longer version of why I think North England is poor, with reference to some relevant episodes of Tyler’s podcast and with some links back to the summary I put at the top.</p>
<h3>1. and 2. 1066 and Universities.</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/simon-johnson/">his conversation with Tyler, Simon Johnson</a>, originally from Sheffield and now in the USA, flippantly suggests that the Norman Conquest is to blame for the North’s weak economy today. There is some truth to this, as Tyler is quick to note. Simon’s flippancy is part of the desire to avoid looking too conspiratorial I mentioned earlier. He’s right, but he’s learned not to say it too seriously.</p>
<p>England’s King Harold had in early 1066 expelled the Danes from North England, decisively winning the battle of Stamford Bridge, a village just five miles from where I grew up and for whom I played kids football.</p>
<p>A few months later, Harold’s life and reign would end in defeat to Norman French King William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings. In the following decade England’s new King William’s harrying of the North decimated the population of potentially-rebellious North England and destroyed much of its wealth. Genocide is probably too strong a word, though some have used it.</p>
<p>But a millennium is a long time, and more recent historical events of this pattern matter more because they set North England on a much more damaging economic path.</p>
<p>In the 1600s, the North English cities of York, twice, and Durham, once, asked the King and/or Parliament for the right to establish Universities. Their <a href="https://x.com/thomasforth/status/1734986963780796542">grovelling petitions are fun to read and worth your time</a>. They show just how subservient the North English needed to be to be listened to in their national parliament in the South.</p>
<p>This requirement for grovelling has greatly reduced over time, but still remains. I already know I will, for I always have in the past, receive feedback on this blog post from the South suggesting that I show more respect for Britain’s institutions and experts, blame others less and be more constructive on ways forward, and find a way to work together for the greater national good. British institutions usually invite me to London to be told this, which is one reason I so rarely go.</p>
<p>The North’s grovelling petitions were rejected each time under strong pressure from representatives of Oxford and Cambridge, whose universities each received two dedicated MPs in the House of Commons until 1950. Today South East England has its two ancient Universities in Oxford and Cambridge while Scotland and Ireland have five between them. North England has none.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://losthunderlads.com/2011/03/25/great-universities-and-great-cities/">If you want to build a great city, create a university and wait 200 years</a>” the saying goes, though I don’t think the lesson translates well from the American federal context to the English centralised government context. But if it does, York will be waiting a while to achieve greatness having only been finally allowed to build its University in 1963. Durham shows no sign of lifting its surroundings from poverty as it approaches its two hundredth anniversary.</p>
<p>This pattern of South East England asserting dominance by weakening the North occurs frequently in British history and is still common. We’ll return to it after the industrial revolution.</p>
<h3>3. The industrial revolution.</h3>
<p>Industry had been stumbling along for a century or more but it was when the Stockton to Darlington railway in County Durham began operating in 1825 that North England really changed, and the world quickly changed with it. Soon the original modern city of Manchester was connected to one of the busiest ports in the world at Liverpool. From Birmingham to Glasgow the industrial revolution had accelerated to full pace. The trend rate of British growth had changed forever and <a href="https://x.com/thomasforth/status/1864055505506734092">the graph of British GDP turns sharply upward in precisely 1825</a>.</p>
<p>For a brief period, North England was near enough the economic equal of the South. The tragedy for the North is that this did not persist through the decline of industry. Part of the blame for that is the lack of North English universities.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/paul-graham/">his conversation with Paul Graham</a>, Tyler talks about the industrial revolution and the split between the North’s industry and the South’s ideas.</p>
<p>“Tyler: The Industrial Revolution happens further north, but the ideas, the science, in or near London, maybe Cambridge. Paul: And Oxford.”</p>
<p>There is much truth to this, largely for the obvious reason that North England is still prohibited from having universities by the British Parliament.</p>
<p>Oxford and Cambridge are the two permitted universities of England and organisations such as the Royal Society and Royal Institution with royal charters provide state-sanctioned forums for the promotion of science in London.</p>
<p>But this does not mean that North England’s industrial revolution relied on ideas and science from the South East. North England’s industrial revolution was powered by North English engineers and substantially by Scottish scientists such as James Watt from Glasgow and its university.</p>
<p>Nor did the North’s industrial revolution rely on Southern money.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/noel-johnson-and-mark-koyama/">their conversation, Mark Koyama notes</a> that “one noticeable thing about the English Industrial Revolution is it doesn’t occur in a political centre. it occurs in the periphery, in Manchester, Yorkshire, Birmingham, Derbyshire” and that “London has a sophisticated banking sector, but the London bankers are not financing the Industrial Revolution. They’re being financed out of savings”.</p>
<p>Even more than being at first unaware and then uninterested, much of the British establishment in South East England was deeply negative about the industrial North and its inventions. Queen Victoria was infamously repulsed by the Black Country, North West of Birmingham, and England’s de facto national anthem Jerusalem refers to “dark satanic mills” not fantastic wealth-generating mills.</p>
<p>New ideas coming from the newly rich North threatened social order and the establishment yielded as slowly as they could. The chartists and the suffragettes pushed for and eventually won the right for MPs to represent more or less equal sized constituencies (until 1832, the City of London had four MPs while Birmingham, Manchester, and Leeds together had none) elected by both men and women from a broad section of their societies in secret ballots. The Labour Party grew out of Glasgow and Bradford and rose to be the second power in British politics.</p>
<p>Against great protests of Oxford and Cambridge, the British Parliament finally allowed a third university in England. London first, of course, in 1836, and then Durham in 1837. Even Manchester eventually won that right in 1880.</p>
<p>This competition of societies within Britain led to great Northern social ideas such as Manchester Liberalism, an end to the Corn Laws, free trade, professional sports, and a fairer democracy eventually triumphing nationally. The North is rightly proud of the huge legacy it has of making Britain and the world better. I take great pride in the statues of Bright, Cobden, and many others that stand in the centres of North England's cities and towns.</p>
<p>Local power in the North also created great municipal innovations ranging from Newcastle’s excellent electrical system, Bradford’s pioneering waste system, and Birmingham’s exceptional (except for the Welsh villages flooded to create it) water supply. We’ll return to that in a bit.</p>
<h3>4. The hierarchy of Britons.</h3>
<p>The North’s rise was not to last. Britain’s national institutions were always working to grab back power as soon as they got the chance.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/roy-foster/">his interview with Roy Foster</a> — an interview which to most listeners, and possibly even to Roy Himself, seems completely unrelated to North England — and as part of a discussion on why Ireland was treated substantially worse than Scotland within the Union, Tyler asks if there was ever any hope of Ireland remaining United and within the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Roy Foster: “The theory of the Act of Union between Ireland and Britain was that Ireland would be treated as any other part of the United Kingdom. The fact of it  —  when Irish people starved and died in their hundreds of thousands, and indeed millions, during the Great Potato Famine of the 1840s  —  was that they were not treated as if they were “any” part of the United Kingdom.”</p>
<p>This is true. There was a hierarchy of Britons in the eyes of the British state and its institutions. The Irish were at the bottom from the moment they joined until the moment they died of famine, emigrated in despair, or saw their country achieve independence.</p>
<p>In these histories it is often written as if it was the English who were on top, but, as so often when treating the English as a homogenous whole, this leaves unsaid that England had a hierarchy of its own.</p>
<p>Using the number of MPs in Parliament per 100,000 population, we see that, as always, it is the South English on top, with the North English closer to the Scots and Irish.</p>
    <figure><img src="https://tomforth.co.uk/whynorthenglandispoor/4_MPsPerPerson.png">
        <figcaption>The number of MPs per person in 1831 gives us a way to measure the importance of each part of Briton within Britain and shows that far from the English dominating the Union, it was, and is, specifically the South English, as it has been for at least eight centuries.</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>No understanding of North English poverty today can separate itself from the founding hierarchy of our nation which is visible in the data nearly eight centuries later. This imbalance is today fixed in the Commons, though the hierarchy of Britons which it betrays has simply shifted to unelected parts of Britain’s institutions. This is <a href="https://www.tomforth.co.uk/movethelords/">most visible in the House of Lords which remains an overwhelmingly Southern part of our Parliament</a>.</p>
<p>And it is the House of Lords that Roy Foster brings up later in their conversation,</p>
<p>“The other great missed chance is in 1886, when Gladstone converted himself and a large part of his ruling Liberal Party in Britain to the cause of Irish home rule … they did reject it, the House of Commons. They passed it a few years later, but it was rejected by the House of Lords.”</p>
<p>The rest is history as regards Ireland. But another event in 1886 tells us even more about the hierarchy of Britons, its contribution to the end of that Union, and hints at an alternative that could have saved it.</p>
<h3>4a. Rugby and what it teachers us about an alternative history.</h3>
<p>The game of Rugby was run from London, having been invented in England, and the four nations of the UK had been playing regular international matches for about a decade. But when in 1884 England and Scotland disputed the result of a match on an interpretation of the rules, England’s resolution was to say that since they set the rules of the game, they were right. This was typical, and typically unwise.</p>
<p>Scotland refused to play England in 1885. In 1886 Ireland, Wales, and Scotland met in Dublin to agree to form their own governing body of Rugby, and in 1887 the three countries, England did not attend nor would they play the other home nations until they conceded defeated and joined the breakaway code in 1890, met in Manchester to write the rules.</p>
<p>Manchester is of course in England, so it may seem odd to many that the three breakaway nations met there. But Manchester is not in the same England as the England that ran Rugby. If you need more proof of this you should know that within a decade the North English rugby clubs would themselves split from the South so that they could play professionally in a Rugby League, cementing against Southern outrage the existence of one of the UK’s most lucrative industries today: professional sports leagues.</p>
<p>Manchester was in England, but it was felt to be a different and a neutral England by Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. It was and is substantially free of the worst of the attitude of superiority and the denial of self-preference that come from the South East. To this day I and other North Englanders are excused, often awkwardly after the fact, from rants by the Irish and Scots in pubs after events about “the bloody English”. We are rarely who they are complaining about.</p>
<p>I am convinced that a United Kingdom that had taken similar steps to Canada (Ottawa), Australia (Canberra), the USA (Washington DC), and Nigeria (Abuja) of putting its capital on neutral territory would have stood a good chance of remaining United.</p>
<p>This did not happen. It would never have been acceptable to the South East, as it almost certainly remains today.</p>
<p>Things would soon change. After nearly a century of losing, the centre of power which remained in the South East, would start winning its battles.</p>
<h3>5., and 6. Grouping, nationalisation, privatisation, and the centralisation of all government under Thatcher</h3>
<p>The First World War, its slaughter of Europe’s young men, and the distraction that caused is part of Ireland’s path to independence. I’ll leave holding much of an opinion on that to people like Roy Foster.</p>
<p>More to my interest, it was also a path to the centralisation of power in Britain and the restoration of a South Eastern order that the industrial revolution had disrupted.</p>
<p>It began, as the flourishing of the industrial revolution had, with the railways, which had in themselves made travel within England easy enough that the North could be governed in absence from the South.</p>
<p>Britain’s railways were large institutions that remained substantially Northern. But as part of the war effort and to make sure that munitions and supplies from the industrial North could efficiently make their way to the front lines, they were put under national government control. The taste of power was too seductive and in 1921, rather than return them to local private control, the UK government decided to combine almost all of them into four groups, all headquartered in London. Full nationalisation of the railways from 1947 would finish the job.</p>
<p>The other powerful institutions of the North were the municipal corporations. With national government largely absent from the industrial North, the horrendous conditions that Marx and Engels described in their books had been substantially ameliorated by new, wealthy, and powerful local governments. They built and municipalised gas, water, electricity, tram, and bus networks and created health, education, parks and recreation, and waste services. They built and maintained roads, and accelerated the building of houses, offices, and factories along them.</p>
<p>The grand city and town halls of North England (a formal “city” in England can only be created from Westminster and by the Monarch, so the North has fewer than it merits) are a testament to the power, prosperity, and Victorian spirit that used to exist in these places. That the city halls are often run down and used for paid concerts and events rather than governing their cities is a testament to what came next.</p>
    <figure><img src="https://tomforth.co.uk/whynorthenglandispoor/5_CentralisationOfGovernment.png">
        <figcaption>The centralisation of the UK government has occured in two phases. First, the nationalisation of municipal corporations which is not shown in this graph. Second, the huge centralisation of UK government in the last fifteen years.</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>Following the second world war, in the 1940s (healthcare, transport, and electricity) through to the 1970s (gas and water) the functions of the municipal corporations were nationalised. By 1979 they were all in one place, neatly organised and run overwhelmingly (and frequently poorly) from London. They were ready for the election of a new Prime Minister with big plans.</p>
<h3>5a. Thatcher</h3>
<p>In his <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/andrew-sullivan/">conversation with Andrew Sullivan</a> Tyler asks “why is there so much residual British hatred of Margaret Thatcher?”. Andrew Sullivan cannot answer. He simply doesn’t understand it. He notes that he is originally from South England in the episode. He sees Thatcher as an overwhelming force for good.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/russ-roberts/">Tyler’s episode with Russ Roberts</a>, Roberts says “the last prominent politician, I think, who made the case for liberty and freedom in and of itself was Maggie Thatcher. Reagan, to some extent, also, but Maggie Thatcher did it relentlessly”.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, Thatcher is mentioned in nine of Tyler’s conversations, never negatively, and mostly in very positive terms.</p>
<p>But Thatcher is a big part of why North England is poor today and her legacy cannot be wished away.</p>
<p>Those wanting a more detailed and more anti-neoliberal account of what follows can read the excellent essay on <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v38/n24/tom-crewe/the-strange-death-of-municipal-england">The Strange Death of Municipal England</a> in the London Review of Books.</p>
<p>I am not going to criticise Thatcher’s liberalism. I wouldn't believe it and others can do that better. I was born in the mid-80’s, socialism was defeated and industry was largely gone by the time I cared. My politics aligns most closely with the Manchester Liberals. Where their political legacy most strongly lies within Britain’s modern political parties is a whole other blog post.</p>
<p>So my beef with Thatcher is not her liberalism. It is with precisely the opposite.</p>
<p>Thatcher privatised the legacy of the municipal corporations that others had already nationalised. No big change. Much more importantly, she destroyed local government so thoroughly that North England’s cites could never rebuild what they had built before.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">Embraced, extended, and extinguished</a>, the North could not argue effectively for its own interests. It was over. And while the South’s economy has grown faster than the North European average since, the North’s economy has sat stagnant for nearly four decades.</p>
<p>Britain has no constitution beyond “Parliament is Sovereign” and so it can have no Tenth Amendment like “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people”.</p>
<p>Without this constraint, Thatcher could destroy all government power outside of South East England. She did just that. Michael Heseltine, the Minister who made so much of the destruction happen, describes it as the greatest regret of his political career and he has spent much of his life trying, with some success, to undo the damage he executed.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan counties were abolished, fragmenting Northern cities into powerless chunks. Buses in those powerless chunks, one of the last remaining local services, were privatised. The Northern cities (London was treated differently for underlying reasons which should be obvious if you’ve read this far) were banned from interfering in public transport in any way. The Mechanics Institutes which the North had built largely in the face of a ban on Northern universities and which had evolved into Polytechnics and Technical Colleges were removed from local control and have since been run down to shadows of their former selves. Right-to-buy forced local governments to sell social housing, among their largest asset bases and a stable source of income, to tenants at well below market rates and give a portion of the proceeds to the central government. Powers of local governments to raise taxes were substantially removed</p>
<p>While Thatcher promoted the market and competition for the private sector, she created a central monopoly on the power of government. Northern cities did not privatise their remaining services because Thatcher won the argument for liberalism. Northern cities privatised their remaining services because their leaders would go to jail and Thatcher would do it for them if they refused to. The last flicker of the Northern power that the industrial revolution had created was stamped out.</p>
<p>"You can just do things" is an emerging meme in the pro-growth community, but since Thatcher that has been largely untrue in North England. Most of the time, someone from central government will block you, if you succeed they will try and stop you, and if you continue succeeding they will subsidise your competitors.</p>
<p>Britain’s equivalents of Detroit (Birmingham), Chicago (Manchester and Liverpool), and Pittsburgh (Sheffield) have not been able to bounce back from deindustrialisation in anything like the same way. They have nowhere near the same powers. Alternatives to Austin, Miami, or Phoenix similarly have no chance of emerging, lest they pose a competition to South East England. We cannot just do things.</p>
<p>Scotland could see what was happening. It had signed up to be part of a United Kingdom, not complete rule from London. Support for <a href="https://tomforth.co.uk/unreasonablesuccess/">independence rose from below 15% to over 40% under Thatcher</a>. Tony Blair’s devolution to Scotland brought that back down and freed Scotland up to outperform North England, but the return of the Conservatives to power and the huge centralisation of government within England over the last fifteen years has pushed support for Scottish independence back up to a majority view among the working age of Scotland.</p>
<h3>7. and 8. Industrial strategy today.</h3>
<p>For the last fifteen years, the UK government has spoken much about returning power to the North and levelling up Britain.</p>
<p>We should recognise the achievements. George Osborne as Chancellor and importantly as a North English MP forced through the recreation in the form of Metro Mayors of the metropolitan counties that Thatcher had destroyed. Under Theresa May the central government ban on local government regulating bus services was removed for England’s large cities. This year Greater Manchester finally took back control of every bus in the city, ensuring consistent fares, compatible tickets, and a measure of integrated transport.</p>
<p>But these hard-won steps forward have each time been accompanied by larger steps back.</p>
<p>Britain’s government and institutions have continued to move Britain’s science and innovation from the rest of the country to London, Oxford and Cambridge.</p>
<p>Investment in transport infrastructure remains effectively forbidden outside of central government, except in London by special dispensation, and the UK government has invested in and around London and almost nowhere else in England.</p>
<p>London’s eye-wateringly expensive cross-city railways — Thameslink and Crossrail — are world-leading. Meanwhile, Manchester and Birmingham remain the two largest cities in Europe without a metro system.</p>
<p>London is connected to Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam by high speed rail to the beautifully restored St. Pancras station. From that station the domestic trains to small towns in the South East are long, modern, reliable, high speed and electric. At the same time the domestic trains to North England from that station — a station built with Northern money to serve Northern destinations — are pushed aside to make way for more important destinations to the South, are short, delayed, and emit diesel fumes that stain the ceiling of the Northern corner of the station. The Northern city of Sheffield which they run to is the largest city in Europe (except Albania) without a single electric train service. And its connection to Manchester, the North’s now-undisputed hub city, is unique among such a large pair of cities in the developed world in being a single lane in each direction.</p>
<p>HS2, the enormously expensive new railway that the North supported largely because it would smuggle Northern investment into a single project containing London and which which was thus likely to be funded by the UK government has had all of its Northern sections cancelled despite them offering the best return on investment. It will terminate shortly after leaving South England.</p>
<p>Leeds remains the largest city in Europe and North America with no mass transit system at all. The UK government recently blocked an expansion of its airport in part to keep the carbon budget available for airport expansion in London and a mistake of law by the UK government saw nearly half of the homes it planned to build this decade blocked.</p>
<p>While the UK government talked about getting power and government out of London, even establishing outposts of central power in towns like Darlington — deliberately chosen because its small size and position between great cities means it could not contribute to the creation of an agglomeration that might challenge London’s monopoly on power — it centralised its civil service overall and moved a further million government employees from local government to central government control.</p>
<p>The return to the historical hierarchy of Britons that Thatcher accelerated now seems at times irreversible. People who live and work in South England simply count more to Britain’s national institutions than people who live and work in North England.</p>
<p>A new generation of British national policy thinkers, policy advisors, politicians, and custodians of Britain’s national institutions now live almost none of their lives outside of South East England. They rarely have a memory of, or interest in, an England that is not ruled overwhelmingly from the centre. They are more likely to hire Americans, exhilarated by the potential to wield and influence the centralised power that is prohibited to them at home by their constitution, than let someone who lives and works in North England take a position of power without moving to London or spending much of their time there.</p>
<p>While arguing for growth today, a new generation of pro-growth voices in British policy repeat the mistake that Thatcher cemented in British political economy of thinking that a well-managed central monopoly on power is better than a competitive dispersal of power.</p>
<p>They celebrate new scientific institutions in London such as ARIA that repeat, against <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/the-missing-4-billion/">strong evidence that it will not deliver greater returns in doing so</a>, the centralisation in the South East of England of our national research capacity.</p>
<p>They celebrate British political thinkers like Dominic Cummings whose consistent political legacy is the centralisation of ever more power in Whitehall and Westminster and the belief that this time, if we just hire the smartest people and get them all the data they need and apply AI to government we can get central planning to work.</p>
<p>They also celebrate the creation of new organisations, when they like them, such as The Open Data Institute, Nesta, GDS, the Ada Lovelace Institute, Tech City, the AI Safety Institute, and many more that employ large numbers of well-paid people in the capital and that at best prefer to spend money locally and represent local interests as national objectives and at worst actively oppose and shut down success elsewhere in the country.</p>
<p>They rarely notice that The British Library, <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/10/23/the-miracle-of-kings-cross">a hub for so much growth in North London</a>, continues to fail to progress its now decades-long stated ambition of opening an outpost in North England.</p>
<p>They promote the forced expansion by central government of the small city of Cambridge and London’s main airport at Heathrow while not considering that the same powers that will force this growth also enable, and have been proven to enable, the UK government to block the expansion of airports in the North and the growth of Northern cities.</p>
<p>This all happens largely without malice. It is the result of England having forgotten, and — embarrassed by the comparative success of Ireland and Scotland having rejected this centralisation — not taking the opportunity to remind themselves of the power of competition and markets in government.</p>
<p>South England’s pro-growth policy thinkers seem well-informed on the perils of monopoly power and the tempting but wrong arguments for the efficiencies of central planning in the private sector, but ambivalent to those same arguments applied to government.</p>
<h3>9. Sanity checking, AI, and a problem that cannot be ignored.</h3>
<p>At this point, especially if you are not from Britain and Ireland, I would be surprised if you did not think I was at least slightly mad. I sometimes wonder that myself, to the extent that I try and test my sanity. I speak to a lot of people who tell me I’m not mad, but maybe there’s something in Northern water that’s affecting us all.</p>
<p>I am fortunate as an early builder of, and Head of Data at, one of the UK’s few new Northern institutions that the South has been unable to close down (though they did make us change our name, and we can’t strictly call ourself an institute as that word requires permission from the South to use).</p>
<p>So when the interesting new London-based think tank UK Day One published the results of a survey of pro-growth economists who I suspect to be overwhelmingly South English and suggested that these results showed a national opinion, I was able to quickly organise <a href="https://open-innovations.org/blog/2024-10-15-results-from-another-uk-growth-survey.html">a survey of North English economists to show how differently we see the path to growth</a>. I convinced myself I wasn’t mad.</p>
<p>I am also fortunate to be a founder and the CTO of <a href="https://thedatacity.com/">one of the UK’s fastest-growing AI startups</a>.</p>
<p>So I can run extremely powerful AI models locally and thus ensure they cannot simply agree with my known opinions (which they are otherwise known to do). I can check that my reading of UK policies, strategies, and laws that I think obviously preference South England also read that way to a relatively impartial machine.</p>
<p>Recently I asked DeepSeek to tell me if the UK’s new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-opportunities-action-plan/ai-opportunities-action-plan">AI Opportunities Action Plan</a> favoured South England or North England. It was able to confirm my suspicions that the concrete action of establishing the UK’s first AI Growth Zone in Oxfordshire (the South) trumped the promise of such growth zones benefitting post-industrial towns (the North) and coastal Scotland.</p>
<p>So I don’t think I’m completely mad and nor do I think that my rantings in this blog post are completely futile.</p>
<p>Where the UK government has funded growth in North England in a way that should work, it has worked in about the measure their funding and freedoms would allow. It is a low bar, but <a href="https://tomforth.co.uk/humancapital/">Manchester’s economy has nearly kept up with East German cities while the rest of North England falls behind</a>. We see from that city that strong local leadership can convince the British state to treat the North less badly and that given even slightly less bad government from the centre, the North can do well.</p>
<p>I also know that the North cannot be ignored. The British state cannot afford the large and increasing fiscal transfers needed to maintain national public services in a North whose economy is so weak.</p>
        <figure><img src="https://tomforth.co.uk/whynorthenglandispoor/6_Fiscal%20balance%202023.png">
        <figcaption>North England's weak economy requires large and growing fiscal transfers from the South East.</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>There are simple and proven actions that would change the trajectory of Northern growth and boost British prosperity. I wrote them down at the top of this piece.</p>
<p>I have hope that the British government and our national institutions in the South East of England will do the right thing once they can no longer afford not to. I will continue contributing to a model of partial success that they can build on when they are ready.</p>

            It was a simple, sunny afternoon on Canada’s Prince Edward Island as Joe Velaidum and his partner, Laura Kelly, set off to walk their dog. Noticing a stray leash lying in the yard, Velaidum briefly stopped to pick it up before setting off on a quick walk.

            Minutes later, a meteorite pummeled the walkway — exactly where Velaidum had been standing — and a Ring doorbell camera captured the entire incident on video.

            “I never stop on that spot — ever,” Velaidum told CNN about the incident, which occurred in July 2024. “And looking back on it now, we noticed, because of the video, if I had stayed on that very spot for just two minutes longer, I absolutely would have been struck and probably killed by this meteor.”

            Months later, after undergoing lab analysis that confirmed it was, in fact, a rock that had plummeted from space, the object has been officially <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbull.php?code=84378" target="_blank">cataloged</a> in a database kept by the nonprofit Meteoritical Society.

            The specimen — named “Charlottetown” after the nearby city — stands out because of its accompanying video, which the University of Alberta <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/news/news-releases-and-statements/news-releases/2025/jan/what-does-a-space-rock-sound-like-when-it-hits-the-ground-first-ever-meteorite-to-land-in-prince-edward-island-is-caught-on-camera-makes-auditory-history-and-ends-up-in-u-of-a-collection.html" target="_blank">released</a> last week.

            Velaidum, a university professor himself, did not readily accept the possibility that the object that struck his front yard was extraterrestrial in origin. More likely, he guessed, it fell from an aircraft or off the roof.

            It was Kelly’s father, who lives nearby, who prompted the couple to dredge up some samples for further inspection. Using a vacuum and magnet — which can attract the metals found in meteorites — they scraped together a 95-gram (3-ounce) sample.

            What makes the occurrence more special, Herd said, is the fact that a camera captured the moment of impact — a stunning observation not just because it confirms the meteorite’s arrival, but also because the footage can benefit science.

            But its origin is no less fascinating: “We’re quite certain in the scientific community that these types of meteorites come from broken pieces off of asteroids in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter,” Herd said.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	   
<p><img alt="Hacker smiley face" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2022/09/15/cyber-smiley-lower.jpg" width="1600"></p>

<p>A threat actor targeted low-skilled hackers, known as "script kiddies," with a fake malware builder that secretly infected them with a backdoor to steal data and take over computers.</p>

<p>Security researchers at CloudSEK report that the malware infected 18,459 devices globally, most located in Russia, the United States, India, Ukraine, and Turkey.</p>

<p>"A trojanized version of the XWorm RAT builder has been weaponized and propagated," reads the <a href="http://www.cloudsek.com/blog/no-honour-among-thieves-uncovering-a-trojanized-xworm-rat-builder-propagated-by-threat-actors-and-disrupting-its-operations" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CloudSEK report</a>.</p>

<p>"It is&nbsp;<strong><em>targeted specially towards script kiddies who are new to cybersecurity</em></strong> and directly download and use tools mentioned in various tutorials thus showing that there is no honour among thieves."</p>

<p>CloudSEK has found the malware included a kill switch that was activated to uninstall the malware from many of the infected machines, but due to practical limitations, some remain compromised.</p>

<div>
<figure><img alt="Location of infected devices" height="500" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2025/January/hackers.jpg" width="842"><figcaption><strong>Location of infected devices</strong><br><em>Source: CloudSEK</em></figcaption></figure></div>

<h2>Fake RAT builder installs malware</h2>

<p>The researchers say they recently discovered a Trojanized XWorm RAT builder being distributed through various channels, including&nbsp;GitHub repositories, file hosting platforms, Telegram channels, YouTube videos, and websites.</p>

<p>These sources promoted the RAT builder, stating it would allow other threat actors to utilize the malware without having to pay for it.</p>

<p>However, instead of being an actual builder for the XWorm RAT, it infected the threat actor's devices with the malware.</p>

<p>Once a machine is infected, the XWorm malware checks the Windows Registry for signs it is running on a virtualized environment and stops if the results are positive.</p>

<p>If the host qualifies for infection, the malware performs the required Registry modifications to ensure persistence between system boots.</p>

<p>Every infected system is registered to a Telegram-based command and control (C2) server using a hardcoded Telegram bot ID and token.</p>

<p>The malware also automatically steals Discord tokens, system information, and location data (from IP address), and exfiltrates it to the C2 server. Then, it waits for commands from the operators.</p>

<p>Out of the 56 commands supported in total, the following are particularly dangerous:</p>

<ul><li><strong>/machine_id*browsers</strong> – Steal saved passwords, cookies, and autofill data from web browsers</li>
	<li><strong>/machine_id*keylogger</strong> – Record everything the victim types on their computer</li>
	<li><strong>/machine_id*desktop</strong> – Capture the victim’s active screen</li>
	<li><strong>/machine_id*encrypt*&lt;password&gt;</strong> - Encrypt all files on the system using a provided password</li>
	<li><strong>/machine_id*processkill*&lt;process&gt;</strong> - Terminate specific running processes, including security software</li>
	<li><strong>/machine_id*upload*&lt;file&gt;</strong> - Exfiltrate specific files from the infected system</li>
	<li><strong>/machine_id*uninstall</strong> – Remove the malware from the device</li>
</ul><p>CloudSEK found that the malware operators had exfiltrated data from roughly 11% of the infected devices, mostly taking screenshots of infected devices, as shown below, and stealing browser data.</p>

<h2>Disrupting with the kill switch</h2>

<p>The CloudSEK researchers disrupted the botnet by utilizing hard-coded API tokens and a built-in kill switch to uninstall the malware from infected devices.</p>

<p>To do this, they sent a mass uninstall command to all listening clients, looping through all known machine IDs they had previously extracted from Telegram logs. They also brute-forced machine IDs from 1 to 9999, assuming a simple numeric pattern.</p>

<div>
<figure><img alt="Sending out the uninstall command" height="600" width="615" data-src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2025/January/unisntall.jpg" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2025/January/unisntall.jpg"><figcaption><strong>Sending out the uninstall command</strong><br><em>Source: CloudSEK</em></figcaption></figure></div>

<p>Although this caused the malware to be removed from many of the infected machines, those not online when the command was issued remain compromised.</p>

<p>Also, Telegram subjects messages to rate limiting, so some of the uninstall commands may have been lost in transit.</p>

<p>Hackers hacking hackers&nbsp;is a common scenario we often see manifesting in the wild.</p>

<p>The takeaway from CloudSEK's findings is never to trust unsigned software, especially those distributed by other cybercriminals,&nbsp;and only install malware builders on testing/analysis environments.</p>
