          Solano County sits at the crossroads of Northern California. Nestled
          between Sacramento, the Delta, San Francisco, and Napa Valley, Solano
          perfectly captures the diversity of California’s landscapes and its
          people. It is the home of agriculture and green energy industries that
          sustainably feed and power our state, strong middle-class communities,
          and our nation’s busiest Air Force base. Eastern Solano County is also
          an area ready for a new community. We’re excited to tell our story.
          </p><p>
          
           California Forever is the parent company of Flannery Associates. Over
          the last few years, Flannery has purchased over 50,000 acres in Solano
          County. To date, our company has been quiet about our activities. This
          has, understandably, created interest, concern, and speculation. Now
          that we're no longer limited by confidentiality, we are eager to begin
          a conversation about the future of Solano County – a conversation with
          all of you. Like much of our state, Solano County faces many
          challenges - but also presents countless opportunities. Over the past
          few years, we have completed surveys and interviews with about 2,000
          residents of Solano County and your voices were clear. Residents want
          more opportunities to buy homes in safe, walkable communities. Good
          paying local jobs, so they can both live and work in the county.
          Better funding to improve schools, promote public safety, and reduce
          homelessness, as well as resources to invest in infrastructure for
          transportation, water, and wildfire protection.
        </p></div>
        <p>
          Last month, 81% of Solano parents we surveyed said that their kids
          won’t be able to find a future in their own neighborhood when they
          grow up.
        </p>
        <p>
          These challenges often have separate, unrelated causes. But they could
          share a common solution. Instead of watching our kids leave, we have
          the opportunity to build a new community that attracts new employers,
          creates good paying local jobs, builds homes in walkable
          neighborhoods, leads in environment stewardship, and fuels a growing
          tax base to serve the county at large. And, Solano has the right
          location for a project like this in the eastern part of the county.
        </p>

          The area today.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not just our idea. In the past, when preparing long-range
          plans for the Bay Area, the Association of Bay Area Governments
          ("Regional Plan 1970-1990") and the U.S. Department of Commerce
          ("Future Development of the San Francisco Bay Area, 1960-2020") both
          concluded that to keep our region affordable, prosperous, and
          balanced, new industries and communities could be built in eastern
          Solano. The area had low fire risk, access to water, and was
          strategically located in the middle of the larger Northern California
          region. All that remains true today.
        </p>
        
        <h2>
          Let’s dust off those plans, <br>
           and breathe new life into them.
        </h2>
        
        <p>
          California Forever was founded in 2017 by our CEO, Jan Sramek. After
          moving to California a decade ago, Jan spent time in Solano County
          during fishing trips on the California Delta and fell in love with the
          area. Having previously lived in many of the world’s most walkable,
          livable, and sustainable towns and cities, Jan became interested in
          fusing what he learned about those livable communities with those old
          plans for eastern Solano. He became committed to a vision for the
          future of Solano County. Jan and his wife Naytri recently purchased
          their first-ever home in Solano, and they are excited to live here
          with their toddler daughter, her soon-to-arrive little brother, and
          golden retriever Bruce.

          This idea of building a new community and economic opportunity in
          eastern Solano seemed impossible on the surface, but after spending a
          lot of time learning about Solano and its people, Jan became convinced
          that with a thoughtful design, the right long-term patient investors,
          and strong partnerships with all stakeholders, there would be an
          opportunity to build a remarkable place for Solano residents, both
          current and the many generations to come.

          To make sure we could do this right, our company raised capital from
          people who shared our long-term vision and belief that California’s
          best days are still ahead. Investors in California Forever include
          Marc Andreessen, Patrick and John Collison, Chris Dixon, John Doerr,
          Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross, Reid Hoffman, Michael Moritz, Laurene
          Powell Jobs, and the California investment firm Andreessen Horowitz.
          Our company is committed to Solano and this project for the long term.

          Over the past few years, we have purchased over 50,000 acres in
          eastern Solano County, between Fairfield and Rio Vista. California
          Forever owns about half of the properties in this area. Other
          landowners own the remaining half. Our project would not change the
          zoning of other landowners’ properties – they would remain zoned for
          agriculture, and those landowners would be able to continue their
          agricultural operations. In addition, on our lands, the project would
          include a variety of land uses – a new community, but also solar farms
          and open space, including both agriculture and habitat conservation.
          Our project would protect and support Travis Air Force Base, including
          by respecting Solano County’s official Travis Reserve Area, which is a
          security buffer for the protection of Travis Air Force base
          established by Solano County in its
          <a href="https://www.solanocounty.com/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=11013" target="_blank">General Plan</a>, and subsequently clarified through a recent ordinance.
          </p><p>
          
           We have also assembled a team of experts to design this project in
          partnership with all of you. In doing so, we intentionally found
          people who are not only world-class, but also local to the Bay Area,
          with a deep connection to this area and a shared commitment to solving
          Northern California’s most important challenges. Our growing team
          includes

          To start, we are meeting with the elected representatives of Solano
          County. Second, so that we hear from each of you directly, we will be
          mailing a survey to every Solano household. Third, we are forming a
          Community Advisory Board of Solano citizens. Please send any
          nominations to <a href="mailto:community@californiaforever.com">
            community@californiaforever.com</a>. Finally, we are working on opening offices in Vallejo, Fairfield

            This is a project that must be not just designed with, but also
            approved by, all Solano residents. Solano County’s Orderly Growth
            Measure directs development into cities, and asks that new projects
            outside of cities be submitted to the voters for approval. We fully
            support these principles, and we will ultimately ask the voters to
            approve the project. The Orderly Growth Measure is the right
            approach to safeguard Solano, including our project, from sprawl and
            disorderly growth for many years to come.

          <p>
            California was built on its pioneering spirit, its boundless
            optimism, and the utter conviction that if we work hard, and
            together, that our best days still lie ahead, waiting to be built,
            for our children, and their children, and for all the generations to
            come. California Forever is committed to building a place that
            embodies these ideals. Join us.

            County. We are committed to five principles about what to build, and
            what to protect based on our conversations with the people of

        <h3>Create good paying local jobs, and paths to get those jobs, for Solano’s residents.</h3>
        <p>This project can bring new employers to Solano, and independently create thousands of permanent, good-paying local jobs in construction, energy, services, and other industries. We are also interested in building trade schools and other educational paths that help Solano residents learn the skills they need to get those new jobs and build long-lasting careers</p>

        <h3>Build walkable neighborhoods and new paths to homeownership.</h3>
        <p>Our goal is to build homes of different sizes and price points integrated in the same walkable neighborhoods, with homes, shopping, dining, and schools all within walking distance. We are also interested in exploring new paths to homeownership for Solano residents through down-payment assistance programs and other solutions</p>

        <h3>Help solve regional infrastructure needs, including energy, transportation, water, and wildfire protection.</h3>
        <p>Eastern Solano benefits from existing transmission lines that could make it possible to build a large solar farm that creates hundreds of jobs and accelerates California’s transition to clean energy. Improvements to Highway 12 could make it safer and less congested. The North Bay Aqueduct needs  <a href="https://www.scwa2.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NBA-Funding-Flyer.pdf" target="_blank"> major upgrades</a> to deliver cleaner and more reliable water to over 400,000 people in Solano and Napa counties. Solano’s rural fire districts need more money to keep communities safe from wildfires. We cannot solve any of these issues on our own, but we want to be part of larger regional solutions.</p>

        <h3>Protect and support Travis Air Force Base.</h3>
        <p>Travis Air Force Base is critical to both our national security and to Solano County. We fully support its mission and always will. For example, when California Water Service and Travis were building a new water pipeline to Travis in 2021 and asked us to sell them a right of way for the pipeline, we immediately offered to donate the right of way for free instead. We are just beginning our dialogue with Travis about the right safeguards, but we are committed to respecting its boundaries both on the ground and in the air. We also hope to work with the Air Force in other ways, including by helping provide homes to base personnel, and training and career options for veterans.</p>

        <h3>Protect Solano’s open space and prime agricultural lands.</h3>
        <p>Solano County has a long history of city-centered growth. We believe building a compact community away from prime agricultural lands, surrounded by open space, is the best way to achieve that objective. Many nearby landowners are committed to agriculture, and have told us they do not want to sell or develop their properties. Their properties will, along with some of our properties, form this agricultural green belt around the new community.</p>

The bar contains two sets of infrared LEDs which the camera can sense, the Wii uses triangulation to calculate the position of the Wiimote from the TV.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The remote is powered by <strong>Broadcom’s BCM2042</strong> <sup id="bibref:1"><a href="#bib:io-wiimote" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></sup>, a chip that includes all the necessary circuitry to become an independent Bluetooth device (CPU, RAM, ROM and, of course, a Bluetooth module). While the Wiimote is programmed to follow the ‘Bluetooth HID’ protocol to be identified as an input device, it doesn’t comply with the standard method of exchanging data (possibly to disallow being used on non-Wii systems).</p><p>Lastly, the Wiimote also includes <strong>16 KB of EEPROM</strong> to store user data and a <strong>small speaker</strong> limited to low-quality samples (3 kHz 4-bit ADPCM or 1.5 kHz 8-bit PCM).</p><h3 id="expansions">Expansions</h3><p>Nintendo shipped this system with another controller to be used on the opposite hand, the <strong>Nunchuk</strong>, this one comes with its own accelerometer, joystick and two buttons. It’s connected to a 6-pin proprietary port on the Wiimote.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/controllers/both.feb109bed137274f24d9c024bf132ed6981ff1060a86233f49bc6067a65dd2ca.jpg"><picture><img alt="Image" width="700" height="475" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/controllers/both.feb109bed137274f24d9c024bf132ed6981ff1060a86233f49bc6067a65dd2ca.jpg" loading="lazy"></picture></a><figcaption>Nunchuk and Wiimote <sup id="bibref:2"><a href="#bib:photography-amos" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></sup>, respectively.</figcaption></figure><p>Other accessories were also built for this port, each one provided different types of input.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>After the success of Gekko, IBM presumably grabbed this design and re-branded it as ‘750CL’ for other manufacturers to use <sup id="bibref:3"><a href="#bib:cpu-ibmcl" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></sup>. Then, when Nintendo requested a new CPU to use with their new console, still known as ‘Revolution’ (hence the RVL prefix on their stock motherboards), IBM and Nintendo agreed to use a 750CL clocked 1.5 times the speed of Gekko. This CPU is known as <strong>Broadway</strong> <sup id="bibref:4"><a href="#bib:cpu-ibmuser" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></sup> and runs at <strong>729 MHz</strong>.</p><p>After having reviewed <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#cpu">Gekko</a>, I’m afraid there aren’t many changes found in the new CPU. However, this may be an advantage: GameCube developers were able to start developing their new Wii games right away thanks to all the experience they gained with Gekko. Moreover, the fact that Broadway runs 1.5x the original speed will allow them to push for more features and quality.</p><h3 id="what-about-memory">What about memory?</h3><p>This one is an interesting bit, the old GameCube memory layout has been re-arranged and enhanced with the following changes:</p><ul><li>Splash (24 MB of 1T-SRAM) now resides inside the Hollywood SoC (explained later) and it is now called <strong>MEM1</strong> <sup id="bibref:5"><a href="#bib:operating_system-memory" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></sup>.</li><li>ARAM (16 MB of serial SDRAM) is long <strong>gone</strong>, however…</li><li>There’s a new memory chip, <strong>MEM2</strong>, which includes <strong>64 MB of GDDR3 SDRAM</strong> for general purpose.<ul><li>This type of memory is based on the traditional DDR2 system but revamped with higher bandwidths (~2 times the original transfer rates) and reduced power consumption, which is ideal for GPUs.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards compatibility</h3><p>For now, you can think of this console as a superset of the GameCube and as such, compatibility with the previous generation of games is naturally inherited. That being said, in order to make the Wii <em>fully</em> backwards compatible, the old set of external ports were brought to the Wii, these include the GameCube controller and memory card ports. However, there’s a new constraint: The new memory map is incompatible with the old one. Thus, a thin ‘emulation’ layer was implemented in software (more details in the ‘I/O’ and ‘Operating System’ section).</p><p>Regarding the GameCube accessories using the Serial/Hi-Speed socket, I’m afraid the Wii didn’t include these ports, so those accessories can’t be used here.</p><p>In later years, new revisions of the Wii saw these ports removed, unfortunately.</p><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>Similarly to the GameCube (where the graphics component, I/O interfaces and audio capabilities were combined into a single package called ‘Flipper’), the Wii follows suit and houses a big chip next to Broadway called <strong>Hollywood</strong>. In here, we find the graphics subsystem which, to be fair, is identical to Flipper’s albeit with minimal corrections.</p><p>Thus, Hollywood’s GPU still performs the same tasks that <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#graphics">Flipper’s counterpart</a> did back in the day but now enjoys <strong>1.5x</strong> the clock speed (<strong>243 MHz</strong>). This increase means that more geometry and effects can be processed during the same unit of time.</p><h3 id="functionality">Functionality</h3><p>As the 3D engine is still <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#graphics">Flipper’s</a>, instead of repeating the same pipeline overview, I will mention some interesting design changes that games had to undergo:</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-standardised-widescreen-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-standardised-widescreen">Standardised Widescreen</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-screen-interaction-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-screen-interaction">Screen Interaction</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-standardised-widescreen"><h4 id="tab-2-1-standardised-widescreen">Standardised Widescreen</h4><figure><ul><li id="tab-1-1-traditional-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-traditional">Traditional</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-wide-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-wide">Wide</a></li><li id="tab-1-3-stretched-link"><a href="#tab-1-3-stretched">Stretched</a></li></ul><figure id="tab-1-1-traditional"><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/mario/4_3.2b878280e7fce445fbae256b65aea45e292121a74c95855ec11410eced337e40.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/mario/_hud9591fdc2908327b39d2e61dce1616c0_101170_fc8ca722c7dcb37e8c721bc333684ce6.webp 500w,

Nevertheless, Flipper’s GPU was already able to do so and a handful of games provided options to activate it, although this was still considered an exclusive feature.</p><p>Be as it may, the framebuffer remains identical and the video encoder still outputs a PAL or NTSC-compliant frame, so this ‘widescreen’ feature is instead accomplished by <strong>widening the field of view</strong> in the projection matrix. The result is a scene rendered with a larger view angle that now appears squashed horizontally. However, the widescreen TV also plays a part in this process, as it will subsequently stretch the 4:3 frame (coming from the console) and the displayed image will thus look <em>more or less</em> in the correct ratio. If you are curious, this technique is not new, it’s been used in film projection and it’s referred to as <strong>anamorphic widescreen</strong>. Also, it’s amusing how SNES developers had to deal with the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/super-nintendo/#display-modalities">opposite effect</a>.</p><p>Back to the point, the Wii standardised this feature by allowing a ‘widescreen mode’ to be activated from its system settings, which in turn promoted its <em>wide</em> adoption (pun intended).</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-screen-interaction"><h4 id="tab-2-2-screen-interaction">Screen Interaction</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/mario/mario_galaxy.dc4152352dc96af339ff599994bc3b1e41b5f9a1092a9521799eee924b6a9877.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/mario/_hu9150dac548a5b29e89b6b1b6c2b128a2_141933_43c0abf5eedd7c8e8de69617243aefcf.webp 500w,

This one carries all of the previous signals plus <strong>YPbPr</strong> (known as ‘component’) <sup id="bibref:7"><a href="#bib:graphics-video" role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></sup>.

That is, no S-Video on PAL systems and no RGB on NTSC ones. Also, RGB can only broadcast interlaced signals (no progressive). On the other side, Nintendo finally shipped a SCART cable (as an extra accessory) which finally makes use of the RGB lines (remember they were ignored since the times of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/super-nintendo/#a-convenient-video-out">SNES</a>).</p><hr><h2 id="audio">Audio</h2><p>The Wii includes the same <strong>Macronix DSP</strong> found in the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#audio">GameCube</a>, you can take a look at that article for the detailed analysis.</p><p>Compared to the GameCube, the only major change is that, since ARAM is gone, either MEM1 or MEM2 can be used as audio buffer.</p><hr><h2 id="io">I/O</h2><p>The I/O subsystem of this console is truly a game changer (<em>if you’ll pardon the pun</em>).

Thus, you can consider Starlet an independent computer running alongside the main CPU.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/diagram.ed6202e358d7637b04322145011303dddb7136dfb947ef6a263168b74ad92b5f.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="1592" height="986" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/diagram.ed6202e358d7637b04322145011303dddb7136dfb947ef6a263168b74ad92b5f.png" loading="lazy"></picture></a><figcaption>Main diagram of the Wii’s architecture. Notice how Starlet is able to control most of the I/O, and even hide some from Broadway.</figcaption></figure><p>The core is similar to the one used on the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-ds/">Nintendo DS</a>, except for including two ‘special’ additions:</p><ul><li>A ‘J’ in its model name, which denotes the inclusion of <strong>Jazelle</strong>: A dedicated unit that executes 8-bit Java Bytecode. Java programs would still depend on the virtual machine (known as ‘JVM’), but some opcodes may get executed directly from the CPU. Overall, this could accelerate the execution of compiled Java code.</li><li>A dedicated <strong>Memory management unit</strong> (MMU) to enable virtual memory. Useful for general-purpose operating systems.</li></ul><p>These enhancements are a bit ‘weird’ since they are completely unused on the Wii. Nonetheless, Nintendo selected that core for Starlet. This reminds me of the first iPhone (2G), which also included an ARM CPU with Jazelle (wasted as well).</p><p>If you’re wondering, Jazelle never took off. After some iterations it was discovered that Java Bytecode just ran better on software. Later on, ARM succeeded Jazelle with ‘Thumb-2EE’ and, at the time of this writing (June 2021), both of these units have been phased out.</p><div><figure><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/console/front.6988a53c2c6a506b86ff4b47840ff50fb53ac07db44a03bee0151b7fe8d79545.jpeg"><picture><img alt="Image" width="316" height="1000" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/console/front.6988a53c2c6a506b86ff4b47840ff50fb53ac07db44a03bee0151b7fe8d79545.jpeg" loading="lazy"></picture></a>

This is especially crucial when it comes to granting access to NAND, for instance, which is where the main operating system and user data are stored.</p><p>The chip also inherits some technology from ARM, such as the <strong>Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture</strong> (AMBA), a protocol that facilitates the communication between devices using a set of specialised buses.</p></div><p>Having said that, Nintendo wired up the I/O in a way that makes use of two AMBA buses <sup id="bibref:8"><a href="#bib:io-diagram" role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li>The <strong>AHB Bus</strong> (AMBA High-performance Bus): As the name indicates, it’s designed for high-speed communication.

This is because Starlet can be reprogrammed when a GameCube game is executed to virtually re-map the I/O, just like the original GameCube would expect to find.</p><p>Additionally, the Real-Time Clock chip includes some spare ROM that stores bitmap fonts (the Latin and Japanese set) used by GameCube games; and SRAM to save <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#operating-system">IPL-related</a> settings.</p></div><hr><h2 id="operating-system">Operating System</h2><p>Generally speaking, there are <strong>two operating systems</strong> residing in the Wii. One is executed on Broadway (main CPU) and the other one on Starlet (I/O CPU). Both reside inside those 512 MB of NAND memory and can be updated.</p><h3 id="starlets-os">Starlet’s OS</h3><p>Starlet is already an interesting piece of hardware, but its software is even more intriguing. You see, not only does this OS have complete access to every single corner of the console, but it’s also the first thing that runs when the power button is pressed.</p><p>Starlet runs a system <em>unofficially</em> referred to as <strong>Input/Output Operating System</strong> or ‘IOS’ (please, do not confuse this with Apple’s iOS) <sup id="bibref:10"><a href="#bib:operating_system-ios" role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></sup>. IOS is a fully-featured operating system composed of:</p><ul><li>A <strong>Microkernel</strong>: Controls the ARM9 CPU, executes <strong>processes</strong> and talks with other hardware using <strong>drivers</strong>.</li><li><strong>Drivers</strong>: Enables the communication with hardware outside the CPU (I/O).</li><li><strong>Processes</strong>: Performs a task, such as network management or implementing a file system.</li><li><strong>Cryptographic core</strong>: Accelerates encryption-related operations (<strong>AES and SHA-1 only</strong>).</li></ul><p>With this in mind, the <strong>main job of IOS is to offload the workload of the main CPU</strong> by abstracting I/O and security. For that reason, programmers don’t have to worry about those matters. In order to accomplish this, Starlet <strong>reserves between 12 and 16 MB</strong> of GDDR3 RAM for its tasks, the rest is used by Broadway and the GPU.</p><p>Broadway and Starlet communicate with each other using an <strong>Inter-Process Communication</strong> or ‘IPC’ protocol: In a nutshell, both CPUs share two registers each. One CPU can write on the other’s registers (the written data may represent a command or a value) and from there, the receiver CPU can perform a function in response.</p><p>The update system of IOS <strong>is a bit tricky</strong>: Updated IOS versions are not installed on top of old ones, but in another slot instead (the reserved area in NAND for IOS is divided into ‘slots’). This is purely <strong>for compatibility reasons</strong>, since it allows older Wii software to keep using the same IOS version it was developed for.</p><p>Nintendo often released IOS updates to improve hardware support (which was necessary when a new accessory was shipped). There’s only <strong>one exception</strong> when IOS updates actually replace older ones: When a specific version was discovered to have an exploitable vulnerability. This was only for security reasons.</p><p>When a GameCube game is inserted, a different thing happens: Starlet boots a <strong>MIOS</strong> instead. This IOS variant just orders Starlet to emulate the original <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#operating-system">IPL</a>.</p><h3 id="broadways-os">Broadway’s OS</h3><p>This one is commonly known as the <strong>System Menu</strong> and effectively runs on the main PowerPC CPU (<strong>Broadway</strong>).</p><p>Compared to IOS, I wouldn’t consider this a ‘fully fledged’ OS, but more like a ‘program’ that allows the user to perform the following operations:</p><ul><li><strong>Start the Wii/GameCube game</strong>: Only if there is a valid one inserted.</li><li><strong>Change console settings</strong>: Including time, date, video mode or sensor bar location, among others.</li><li><strong>Run apps</strong>: One of the novelties of this console is the ability to install small Wii games (called ‘WiiWare’), retro games (‘Virtual Console’ games) or just convenient applications (such as an internet browser). Nintendo called these <strong>channels</strong>, but they are also referred to as <strong>titles</strong> by the OS.<ul><li>Users can download/buy channels through a pre-installed channel called <strong>Wii Shop Channel</strong>.</li><li>Virtual Console titles embed an emulator to run the game itself. Curiously enough, the emulator is not shared across the system or even between games of the same platform. This allows to optimise the emulator for specific games.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Send/Receive messages</strong>: Wiis have a unique ID (burned in their SEEPROM chip) which can be shared to exchange messages between other Wiis. Messages can be seen on the <strong>Message Board</strong>.<ul><li>Nintendo and Wii games also used this medium to provide a newsletter as well.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Just like IOS, Nintendo released multiple updates to this system too. Some fixed security holes, others added more features. A notable new feature was the ability to store channels on the SD card.</p><p>Any program running on Broadway (including the System Menu) relies on a specific IOS version to work. When a game or a channel is booted, Starlet reboots itself using the declared version of IOS needed.</p><h3 id="update-medium">Update medium</h3><p>Nintendo refers to them as <strong>System updates</strong>. They contain the two OSes in the same package and use ordinal numbers for versioning. The last version known is <code>4.3E</code>, released in June 2010.</p><p>System update packages can be fetched from Nintendo’s Servers or game discs. Users can manually check for updates using the System Menu. Updates are forced if a game requires a specific version of IOS that is not installed (and the disc happens to contain the required packages).</p><h3 id="boot-sequence">Boot sequence</h3><p>So far we have discussed two very different operating systems that reside in this console and run concurrently. This seems fairly simple, although both have to be carefully coordinated during the start of the console to work properly afterwards.</p><p>That being said, the boot process of this console is as follows <sup id="bibref:11"><a href="#bib:operating_system-boot" role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></sup>:</p><ol><li>User taps the ON button on the console.</li><li><strong>Boot0</strong> stage: Starlet runs a hardwired program found in its embedded Mask ROM (1.5 KB).<ul><li>In a nutshell, Starlet decrypts and checks the integrity of the first 96 KB of NAND, Starlet then calculates its hash and compares it against a saved hash found on Starlet’s embedded OTP memory. If both hashes do not match, then the console is induced in an infinite loop.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Boot1</strong> stage: Starlet runs a small program found in that aforementioned 96 KB of NAND.<ul><li>This program will just instruct Starlet to initialise (clear) the 64 MB of GDDR3 RAM, then decrypt and verify the rest of NAND.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Boot2</strong> stage: Starlet loads the initial IOS (needed for the System Menu) and then kickstarts Broadway.</li><li>Broadway starts the System Menu. The user is now in control.</li></ol><hr><h2 id="games">Games</h2><p>While new games did not always come with considerable graphical leaps, they did surprise users with the number of features they could now offer. This was thanks to the new services Nintendo shipped with the console’s launch, ranging from the new set of controls, to a standardised online infrastructure (WiiConnect24) which enabled <em>free</em> online gaming.</p><h3 id="medium">Medium</h3><p>Wii games are distributed using a proprietary disc format called <strong>Wii Optical Disc</strong> (I know, the name can’t get more obvious). Anyhow, Matsushita/Panasonic designed this format based on the traditional DVD disc while adding non-standard features, like a <strong>burst cutting area</strong> on the inner section of the disc to prevent unauthorised reproductions.</p><div><p>The Wii disc provides either <strong>4.7 GB</strong> (if single-layer) or <strong>8.54 GB</strong> (if double-layer) of space available. They often contain <strong>two partitions</strong>: The first one for system updates and the other one for the actual game.</p><p>Some games like <em>Super Smash Bros Brawl</em> included more partitions to store multiple Virtual Console games, which were executed inside the main game.</p></div><h3 id="development">Development</h3><p>As part of the tradition, Nintendo supplied a development kit. This one was called <strong>NDEV</strong> <sup id="bibref:12"><a href="#bib:games-ndev" role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a></sup> and shaped like an enlarged black <em>brick</em>. NDEV shipped with enhanced I/O and two times the amount of MEM2 (128 MB in total) for debugging purposes.</p><p>The official software suite was named <strong>Revolution SDK</strong> <sup id="bibref:13"><a href="#bib:games-rsdk" role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a></sup> and it included various tools, compilers, debuggers and frameworks to carry out development (mostly in <strong>C/C++</strong>). Nintendo distributed subsequent updates through a web portal called <strong>Warioworld.com</strong> (now offline/redirected) which only approved developers could access.</p><p>The official SDK relies on IOS calls to interact with the Wii hardware, this is why IOS updates are often correlated to SDK updates.</p><h3 id="return-to-home">Return to Home</h3><p>Considering all the software advancements of this console, it may surprise you that games <strong>still run on bare metal</strong>, which means that they have complete control of Broadway, but not of Starlet (hence, security mechanisms are implemented here). Needless to say, the game’s behaviour is still subject to Nintendo’s approval before getting distributed.</p><div><div><ul><li id="tab-5-2-reminder-link"><a href="#tab-5-2-reminder">Reminder</a></li></ul><figure id="tab-5-2-reminder"><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/ingame/strap_warning.418407004e47be1b1b1da7aded4dbcf5cc720aff24188ca663c24a8016b322b2.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/ingame/strap_warning.418407004e47be1b1b1da7aded4dbcf5cc720aff24188ca663c24a8016b322b2.png" loading="lazy"></picture></a><figcaption>This screen has to be included as well.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Having said that, there are certain features across different games that look awfully identical, somehow. For instance, do you remember the famous <strong>HOME Menu</strong>? Pressing the ‘HOME’ button on the Wiimote will trigger a screen popup in-game, enabling the user to return to the System menu without the need to reboot the console. Considering the OS does not provide this feature, how did every single game manage to come up with the same graphical interface?</p><p>The answer is simple, Nintendo included in their SDK some <strong>mandatory libraries</strong> that games have to embed. <em>Lo and behold</em>, one of them draws that screen. Furthermore, this is the reason you’ll find that only homebrew apps feature ‘original’ designs for the home menu.</p></div><p>The official HOME Menu is one of the 200 or so requirements games had to include, as ruled by the <strong>Wii Programming Guidelines</strong> document (found on the official SDK). Other requirements consisted of displaying the ‘Wii Strap reminder’ screen (which is just a BMP image) at the start of the game, followed by another rule that dictated how to interact with it.</p><h3 id="personalised-titles">Personalised titles</h3><div><p>Another new feature I would like to emphasise is the introduction of <strong>Miis</strong>, some sort of avatars that users could create using a dedicated channel called <em>Mii Channel</em>.</p><p>But the fun didn’t stop there, since games could also fetch these new-created Miis to personalise gameplay.</p></div><hr><h2 id="anti-piracy-homebrew">Anti-Piracy &amp; Homebrew</h2><p>I think the number of features that this console offered made it very attractive for hacking, as cracking the security system would allow homebrew developers to get their hands on the console’s capabilities without having to go through Nintendo’s checks. Be as it may, the Wii ended up having a fantastic Homebrew library.</p><h3 id="copy-protection">Copy protection</h3><p>Let’s start with the common victim: <strong>The disc drive</strong>.</p><p>Wii discs include the aforementioned ‘burst cutting’ area which is inaccessible by conventional readers. So, in the absence of this, the driver will always refuse to read the content.</p><div><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/system/disc.610948e09be6c36a4c8ca6cb6b4ca72ae9dc6e7c00b981e47668a5e9ac24d17c.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="640" height="476" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/system/disc.610948e09be6c36a4c8ca6cb6b4ca72ae9dc6e7c00b981e47668a5e9ac24d17c.png" loading="lazy"></picture></a><figcaption>The disc drive won’t let anyone pass this screen until a valid disc is inserted.</figcaption></figure><p>Modchip developers discovered that the drive contained a debug interface called ‘Serial Writer’ <sup id="bibref:14"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-disc" role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></sup>, though this port is locked until a <em>secret key</em> is entered. Still, it was a matter of time before the key was discovered. Once this happened, modders were able to disable the copy protection and subsequently developed a modchip that automatised this process.</p><p>Matsushita released further revisions of this drive obfuscating the debug interface, however, other flaws in the reader were discovered to re-enable it again.</p></div><p>It’s worth mentioning that the main benefit of modchips was plain piracy, as the disc content is still encrypted, so more research and tools were needed to run custom code.</p><p>GameCube homebrew, on the other hand, was already possible to execute by following <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#tab-5-3-honourable-mention">previous exploits</a> discovered on the predecessor.</p><h3 id="system-encryption">System encryption</h3><p>This is probably the most complex section of this console, yet its never-stopping research opened the door to lots of talented developers and amazing programs.</p><p>The Wii designed its internal security around a couple of cryptographic ciphers (AES, RSA, ECC, SHA-1 and HMAC). To keep explanations easy-to-follow, let’s take a look at each group separately:</p><div><ul><li id="tab-7-1-shared-encryption-link"><a href="#tab-7-1-shared-encryption">Shared encryption</a></li><li id="tab-7-2-chain-of-trust-link"><a href="#tab-7-2-chain-of-trust">Chain of trust</a></li><li id="tab-7-3-starlets-chain-link"><a href="#tab-7-3-starlets-chain">Starlet’s chain</a></li><li id="tab-7-4-more-keys-link"><a href="#tab-7-4-more-keys">More keys</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-7-1-shared-encryption"><h4 id="tab-7-1-shared-encryption">Shared encryption</h4><p>The communication between many components (NAND, game disc and SD card) is encrypted to avoid being tampered with. Nintendo chose a <strong>symmetric key</strong> system to protect it <sup id="bibref:15"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-security" role="doc-biblioref">[15]</a></sup>, meaning that the Wii uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt its data.</p><p>Starlet has three 128-bit AES keys stored in its OTP memory <sup id="bibref:16"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-keys" role="doc-biblioref">[16]</a></sup>, these are written once during manufacturing:</p><ul><li><strong>Common key</strong>: A global key generated by Nintendo that’s found on all Wiis, it is used to decrypt the first layer of encryption used on channels and disc-based games (we’ll refer to them as <strong>titles</strong> from now on).</li><li><strong>SD Key</strong>: This one is used to encrypt/decrypt data transferred to the SD card, and only the System Menu can perform these transfers.<ul><li>Nintendo stored a copy of this key inside IOS for no clear reason.</li></ul></li><li><strong>NAND Key</strong>: This key is randomly generated during the manufacturing process (meaning that it’s unique for every Wii) and it’s used to protect the NAND chip.</li></ul><p>With this, we can see that Starlet is in charge of the encryption/decryption of sensible content, this is why this CPU is the only one that has access to confidential data.</p></div><div id="tab-7-2-chain-of-trust"><h4 id="tab-7-2-chain-of-trust">Chain of trust</h4><p>Titles contain another layer of security, RSA-2048. This is an <strong>asymmetric cipher</strong>, meaning that we need one key to encrypt the content and another one to decrypt it. In a nutshell, this allows Nintendo to encrypt titles using an undisclosed key (called ‘private key’), while the Wii decrypts them using a ‘public key’, which is stored in the console. If hackers were to obtain the public key, it would not be enough to crack the security system, as data is still expected to be encrypted using the private key, which only Nintendo knows.</p><p>Furthermore, RSA is not only used for encrypting content, but also to check the integrity of said encryption. You see, Nintendo uses multiple keys that are used to sign (encrypt) already-encrypted data, forming a chain of encryption with the only purpose of making sure:</p><ul><li>Every single key used has been authorised by Nintendo.</li><li>Data hasn’t been altered and re-encrypted without authorisation.</li></ul><p>Let me give you an example of how this works:</p><ol><li>Nintendo creates a key named <code>x</code>.</li><li>Nintendo programs Starlet to trust content only signed with key <code>x</code>.</li><li>If Starlet finds itself having to decrypt a title with key <code>y</code>, it will only proceed if <code>y</code> has been signed with key <code>x</code>.</li></ol><p>This is called a <strong>Chain of trust</strong>. Outside the Wii, this technique is commonly used to protect most of our communications across the globe (for instance, web browsers using HTTPS rely upon ‘root certificates’ to validate the authenticity of unknown certificates).</p></div><div id="tab-7-3-starlets-chain"><h4 id="tab-7-3-starlets-chain">Starlet’s chain</h4><p>Starlet’s OTP stores public keys (meaning that, for our purposes, it can only decrypt and verify the signature of content). Its chain of trust is made of the following keys <sup id="bibref:17"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-certificate" role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li><strong>Root Key</strong>: Signs the CA key.<ul><li>Starlet only needs to stores this (public) key, the rest can be decrypted (and subsequently trusted) if it’s been signed by this key.</li></ul></li><li>The <strong>Certification Authority Key</strong> (CA): Signs the XS and CP keys.</li><li>The <strong>XS Key</strong>: This key signs ‘Tickets’, a type of data that contains a list of AES keys needed to decrypt titles (called ‘title keys’).</li><li>The <strong>CP Key</strong>: Once the title is decrypted using the respective title key, the CP key is used to sign the metadata of a title (called ‘TMD’).<ul><li>While it doesn’t sign the content per se, the metadata includes an SHA-1 hash that Starlet uses to verify the integrity of that data.</li></ul></li></ul><p>As you can see, all of this <strong>enables Nintendo to be the sole distributor of content</strong>, which can be a good thing for game studios concerned about piracy.</p></div><div id="tab-7-4-more-keys"><h4 id="tab-7-4-more-keys">More keys</h4><p>This system also contains a pair of <strong>ECC private and public keys</strong>. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is another algorithm similar to RSA. In this case, it’s only used to sign the content transferred through the SD card. This is what prevents content copied from one Wii to be used in another one.</p><p>The ECC key is signed by <em>yet another</em> RSA public key called <strong>MS</strong>, which will allow Starlet to trust the ECC key.</p><p>The last key used by this console is the <strong>HMAC key</strong>, which uses another algorithm that combines SHA-1 hashes and HMAC. During the boot process, Starlet checks that NAND hasn’t been altered by third-party hardware. To do that, it computes the SHA-1 hash of NAND and compares it against a hardwired hash to check if they match. In addition to that, the saved hash is signed using the HMAC key to make sure it’s authentic.</p><p>As a final note, the HMAC key is stored in SEEPROM (outside Starlet), not in OTP.</p></div></div></div><p>After all this, it’s worth mentioning that when the system runs GameCube games, <strong>none of the mentioned encryption methods are used</strong>. Instead, Starlet will only check that the game only accesses its designated memory locations. This is because 1/4 of GDDR3 RAM is allocated to simulate old <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#audio">ARAM</a>.</p><h3 id="the-fall-of-encryption">The fall of encryption</h3><p>Let’s start with AES keys, the algorithm may be hard to crack, but if the keys are extracted somehow (especially the common key), that layer of security would be instantly nullified. Thus, the main challenge is <strong>how to extract them</strong>.</p><div><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/encryption.7c5aa62de788fd278b94da98c8dd1a968243baca492048e5884a6d211795f86c.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="507" height="369" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/encryption.7c5aa62de788fd278b94da98c8dd1a968243baca492048e5884a6d211795f86c.png" loading="lazy"></picture></a><figcaption>Starlet’s security diagram.</figcaption></figure><p>Well, a group of hackers called <strong>Team Twiizers</strong> found out that the lack of signatures on GameCube mode may be a promising attack surface <sup id="bibref:18"><a href="#bib:cpu-ccc" role="doc-biblioref">[18]</a></sup>. They not only discovered that <strong>3/4 of that GDDR3 RAM were not cleared</strong> after running a GC program, but also that by bridging some address points on the motherboard (using a pair of tweezers, nonetheless) they could swap the selected banks of GDDR3 RAM, allowing access to restricted areas. Lo and behold, the AES keys were found residing in there.</p></div><p>Let’s not forget that this only allows to decrypt the ‘first layer’ of security, but in order to execute unsigned programs (Homebrew), RSA has to be cracked too. Unfortunately, this can be computationally impossible… Unless there are flaws in its implementation. Well, Team Twizzers didn’t stop there so they started reversing how IOS was coded, focusing on its signature verification functions.</p><p>RSA signature verification, without going into too much detail, works by comparing the hash of the computed RSA operation against the decrypted signature. After some fiddling, the group discovered something hilarious: <strong>Nintendo implemented this function using <code>strcmp</code></strong> (C’s ‘string’ compare).</p><p>For people unfamiliar with C, <code>strcmp</code> is a routine used for checking if two strings are equal. This method receives three parameters: two strings and an integer, the latter states the number of characters to be compared. Afterwards, strcmp starts comparing each character until the end of any string is reached. Strings in C are just a chain of characters terminated by a <code>\0</code> character, this means that strcmp stops comparing once any string reaches <code>\0</code>. Hence, by composing a Wii title in a way that its hash contains zeroes at the beginning, Starlet RSA computations will feed a string starting with <code>\0</code> to strcmp. Thus, the comparison will always return <code>equal</code>… <strong>Title is signed!</strong></p><p>As if that wasn’t enough, this flaw was discovered on multiple IOS versions - and even in routines found on boot1 and boot2!</p><h3 id="the-dawn-of-homebrew">The dawn of Homebrew</h3><p>After this, there was only one thing left: Make the exploit permanent and implement a ‘user-friendly’ tool, so it could run custom programs without hassle.</p><div><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/system/twilight_hack.3860376c5e418ccddbc683a515e3267a240b9603b93f070210aaf45d392e983d.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="640" height="476" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/system/twilight_hack.3860376c5e418ccddbc683a515e3267a240b9603b93f070210aaf45d392e983d.png" loading="lazy"></picture></a><figcaption>Running third-party apps was initially done by using a forged save game.</figcaption></figure><p>So far, these exploits required the use of extra hardware, so not every user could make use of it… Until Team Twizzers discovered <em>yet another</em> exploit: A game buffer overflow.</p><p>I’m referring to the famous <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</strong> (a game by Nintendo, by the way). TT discovered that the game’s save file could be modified to overflow the number of characters used for naming the player’s horse. So, when the player attempts to read the overflowed name, it would trigger a chain reaction ending in arbitrary code execution. This could be used to run, let’s say, a program loader.</p></div><p>Since signatures could now be forged, this crafted save file was easily distributed on the net for other people to use. As a result, the homebrew community was now able to execute their custom software.</p><h3 id="a-permanent-state">A permanent state</h3><p>While further reversing IOS, it was discovered that signatures are only checked during the installation of titles, not during their execution.</p><div><figure><ul><li id="tab-8-1-splash-link"><a href="#tab-8-1-splash">Splash</a></li><li id="tab-8-2-inside-link"><a href="#tab-8-2-inside">Inside</a></li></ul><a id="tab-8-1-splash" href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/system/homebrew_channel.7fd209ca48b7b46a172c00b0b8bdc29e7eb7cf3cc0a9f5f3e109812f8d9f8657.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="640" height="476" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/wii/system/homebrew_channel.7fd209ca48b7b46a172c00b0b8bdc29e7eb7cf3cc0a9f5f3e109812f8d9f8657.png" loading="lazy"></picture></a>

They carefully forged an installable channel that could load arbitrary programs from the SD card.

</figure><p>Human ancestors in Africa were pushed to the brink of extinction around 900,000 years ago, a study shows. The work<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>, published in <i>Science</i>, suggests a drastic reduction in the population of our ancestors well before our species, <i>Homo sapiens</i>, emerged. The population of breeding individuals was reduced to just 1,280 and didn’t expand again for another 117,000 years.</p><p>“About 98.7% of human ancestors were lost,” says Haipeng Li, a population geneticist at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, who co-led the study. He says that the fossil record in Africa and Eurasia between 950,000 and 650,000 years ago is patchy and that “the discovery of this bottleneck may explain the chronological gap”.</p><p>Nick Ashton, an archaeologist at the British Museum in London, who wrote a related perspective, says he was intrigued by the tiny size of the population. “This would imply that it occupied a very localized area with good social cohesion for it to survive,” he says. “Of greater surprise is the estimated length of time that this small group survived. If this is correct, then one imagines that it would require a stable environment with sufficient resources and few stresses to the system.”</p><h2>Clues from modern-day DNA</h2><p>To make their discovery, the researchers needed to invent new tools. Advances in genome sequencing have improved scientists’ understanding of population sizes for the period after modern humans emerged, but the researchers developed a methodology that enabled them to fill in details about earlier human ancestors. Serena Tucci, an anthropologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, says that such work was sorely needed. “We still know very little about the population dynamics of early human ancestors for several reasons, including methodological limitations and difficulties in obtaining ancient DNA data from old <i>Homo</i> specimens,” she says.</p><p>The researchers’ method allowed them to reconstruct ancient population dynamics based on genetic data from modern-day humans. By constructing a complex family tree of genes, the team was able to examine the finer branches of the tree with greater precision, identifying significant evolutionary events.</p><p>The technique “put the spotlight on the period 800,000 to one million years ago — for which there is much unknown — in a way that hasn’t been done before,” says Stanley Ambrose, an anthropologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p><p>This period was part of the Early-Middle Pleistocene transition — a time of drastic climate change, when glacial cycles became longer and more intense. In Africa, this led to long periods of drought. Li says that the changing climate might have wiped out human ancestors and forced new human species to emerge. Eventually, these might have evolved into the last common ancestor of modern humans and our extinct relatives, the Denisovans and Neanderthals.</p><p>Around 813,000 years ago, the population of pre-humans began to swell again. How our ancestors managed to survive, and what allowed them to flourish once more remains unclear, says Ziqian Hao, a population geneticist at the Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences in Jinan, and a co-author of the paper. However, he says that the bottleneck is likely to have had a crucial impact on human genetic diversity, driving many important features of modern humans, such as brain size. He estimates that up to two-thirds of genetic diversity was lost. “It represents a key period of time during the evolution of humans. So there are many important questions to be answered,” he says.</p><p>Ashton would like to see the researchers’ findings backed by more archaeological and fossil evidence. The authors “suggest that the bottleneck was a global crash in population,” he says, “but the number of archaeological sites outside Africa suggests that this is not the case. A regional bottleneck might be more likely.”</p>

That all changed when Alfonso Bialetti invented the Moka Express in 1933, inspired by a washing machine his wife used to do laundry. But the Moka didn’t really catch on until after WWII, when Alfonso’s son Renato refined the octagonal Art Deco design to maximize heat capture in the base and replace the flammable wooden handle with a modern Bakelite one.</p><p>More importantly, Renato was a marketing genius who innovated advertising techniques in the 1950s to include billboards, commercials, and even animations — introducing “l’omino coi baffi” (the little man with a mustache), based on Renato himself. The little man appeared on the side of the Moka pot and also starred in cartoons showing how quick and easy it was to make coffee with the Moka Express: all you need is water, coffee, and fire to brew espresso-style (it’s not quite espresso) coffee in the comfort of your own home. Since then, an estimated 300 million Moka pots have been sold, and today you can find them in 90% of Italian homes.</p></div><div><p>The Moka Express consists of three primary cast aluminum parts: a bottom chamber for water, a middle funnel-shaped filter basket for coffee grounds, and a top chamber to collect the brewed coffee.<br>‍<br>To brew, fill the bottom chamber with water up to just below the safety release valve in the wall. Then add medium-fine ground coffee (slightly coarser than you’d use for espresso) to the filter basket, but don’t tamp it down. Screw the top chamber back on and place on a stovetop at medium heat. Be careful to avoid an open flame going beyond the edges of the base, otherwise you’ll end up with a stalactite of melted plastic at the end of your handle — as you can see in this well-loved Moka pot that we scanned.&nbsp;<br>‍<br>As the water heats up, it creates steam. The steam pressure forces the hot water up through the coffee grounds in the filter basket and into the top chamber. Take it off the heat before the volcanic sputtering phase at the end; this only adds bitterness to your coffee.</p><p>The aluminum components prove to be pretty hearty, and if you don’t use abrasive cleaners, the Moka pot develops a coffee patina that some believe enhances the flavor. The gasket around the filter basket wears out over time and will eventually need to be replaced. Here you see how the rubber has dried and cracked, making a secure seal impossible. Steam and water would escape, resulting in an incomplete extraction.</p><p>Renato Bialetti died in 2016 at the age of 93, and his ashes were interred in a giant Moka pot. Not long after, Bialetti declared bankruptcy but managed to stay afloat after consolidating their business and securing loans. They moved some of their manufacturing outside of Italy, and our CT scans make us wonder if the new Moka Express that we bought on Amazon is a counterfeit or if the quality of the product has fallen off in recent years. Let’s take a look.</p><p>We didn’t need a CT scanner to observe grease around the threading and unwanted aluminum shavings in the lower chamber, but cropping into the center column, we see an uneven surface finish with aluminum debris that hopefully wouldn’t find its way into our coffee.</p><p>The quality of the casting in this piece is also inferior. Cropping into the walls, we find the new Moka pot riddled with porosity. These tiny voids in the aluminum may not represent a problem for the performance of the brewer, but they suggest that changes to the casting process or the use of new suppliers may have had unintended consequences. The old Moka pot had visible flash inside the lower chamber from where the pieces of the mold came together, but there’s none to be seen in the new one. Even if Bialetti isn’t what it once was, the Moka pot is here to stay as a beloved brewing technique and icon of industrial design.</p><p><a href="https://www.lumafield.com/article/discover-the-art-and-science-of-coffee-with-x-ray-ct">Explore the Scans</a></p></div></div></div><div role="listitem"><div id="aeropress"><p><img alt="Intro image for the scan." loading="lazy" src="https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb266dacb057e3fa39ea6_Aeropress_N93A9864.png" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 50vw" srcset="https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb266dacb057e3fa39ea6_Aeropress_N93A9864-p-500.png 500w, https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb266dacb057e3fa39ea6_Aeropress_N93A9864-p-800.png 800w, https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb266dacb057e3fa39ea6_Aeropress_N93A9864-p-1080.png 1080w, https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb266dacb057e3fa39ea6_Aeropress_N93A9864.png 1500w"></p></div><div><div><h3>AeroPress</h3><h5>Aerobie, 2005</h5><p>The AeroPress was invented by Alan Adler, a retired engineering professor and coffee enthusiast, and introduced to the world in 2005. Unlike traditional brewing methods, the AeroPress utilizes a unique combination of air pressure and immersion brewing, delivering a smooth, rich cup of coffee in under a minute. Its ease of use and portability made it an instant hit among coffee lovers and travelers alike. Over the years, the AeroPress has garnered a devoted following, inspiring coffee championships and daring experiments with brewing techniques.</p></div><div><p>The AeroPress consists of two main parts: a cylindrical chamber and a plunger with a rubber seal. To brew coffee with the AeroPress, you place a paper or metal filter inside the bottom of the plastic mesh filter chamber (on the top in the visualization at left). You then add coffee grounds on top of the filter and pour hot water into the chamber. Give the coffee and water mixture a stir to ensure even extraction.<br>‍<br>Once the coffee has steeped for the desired amount of time, insert the plunger into the top of the chamber. Gently pressing down on the plunger creates air pressure that forces the brewed coffee through the filter and into the cup below. You can adjust the plunger’s pressure to create different coffee strengths and flavors, allowing full customization.</p><div><p>The silicone seal gasket wears down over time, but not as much as you would expect from this seven-year-old AeroPress. Cropping into it from the side, there’s a 0.5 mm gap that we can measure in our Voyager analysis software. Removing used coffee immediately after brewing and storing the AeroPress with the seal pushed all the way through the chamber (as shown) can help minimize wear by reducing compression to extend the gasket’s life.&nbsp;</p><p>Now let’s compare our old AeroPress to a brand new one.</p></div><p>The densities of the old AeroPress chamber and plunger were very similar, both appearing light green in our color map. The chamber of the new AeroPress, however, is made of lower density plastic, which shows up as darker in our color map. Perhaps this change in material will lead to reduced wear over time for the plunger. Though the original AeroPress was made of clear polycarbonate, the company switched to using BPA-free copolyester in 2009 and then in 2014 they changed to (also BPA-free) polypropylene — a durable but lightweight thermoplastic. The density shift evident in our comparison scans is the difference between the copolyester and polypropylene models.</p><p>If you’re an AeroPress user, dealing with leaks or drips during brewing can be frustrating and messy. Loose or improperly sealed filters and caps are common culprits that can allow water to escape. Another cause is using water that’s too hot, which can lead to plastic expansion and gaps. To avoid leaks, ensure the filter is securely placed and the cap is tightly screwed for a proper seal. Using a slightly coarser grind size can alleviate pressure and reduce leaks. Optimal water temperature (175°F to 185°F) minimizes plastic expansion and potential gaps, helping to ensure a leak-free cup of coffee.</p><p><a href="https://www.lumafield.com/article/discover-the-art-and-science-of-coffee-with-x-ray-ct">Explore the Scans</a></p></div></div></div><div role="listitem"><div id="gooseneck-kettle"><p><img alt="Intro image for the scan." loading="lazy" src="https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2455eb38b96ebfcd84e_Fellow_Kettle_N93A9891.png" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 50vw" srcset="https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2455eb38b96ebfcd84e_Fellow_Kettle_N93A9891-p-500.png 500w, https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2455eb38b96ebfcd84e_Fellow_Kettle_N93A9891-p-800.png 800w, https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2455eb38b96ebfcd84e_Fellow_Kettle_N93A9891-p-1080.png 1080w, https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2455eb38b96ebfcd84e_Fellow_Kettle_N93A9891.png 1500w"></p></div><div><div><h3>Gooseneck kettle</h3><h5>Fellow, 2022</h5><p>The gooseneck kettle gained prominence with the rise of manual pour-over brewing methods, such as the V60 and Chemex, which require precise control over water flow and distribution. The long, slender spout of a gooseneck kettle allows you to pour water in a slow, controlled, and circular motion. An even saturation of the coffee grounds promotes consistent extraction and ultimately a well-balanced and flavorful cup of coffee. The gooseneck design also helps prevent splashing, ensuring a mess-free and enjoyable brewing experience. Fellow is at the top of the gooseneck game with their Stagg EKG electric kettle line. Let’s see how they manage to achieve unmatched precision in temperature control with our CT scans of both the kettle body and base.</p></div><div><p>With a sleek minimalist design, the Fellow Stagg kettle combines both form and function. Its precision-pour spout has a stainless steel fluted tip that provides optimal control of water flow. Cropping into the counterbalanced handle, we discover the dense embedded weight that shifts the center of mass closer to your hand and makes it easy to maintain a steady stream of water while pouring.<br>‍<br>Notice the recessed edge around the circumference of the kettle body base. This increases the surface area exposed to the heating element and speeds up the formation of the convection current to evenly distribute heat throughout the kettle.</p><p>With the powerful 1200 W heating element (the thin coil wire), the kettle reaches optimal temperature very quickly — in under three minutes. Hidden in the base, we also see a thermal cutoff switch, a mandated safety device that helps prevent fires by interrupting electrical current when the temperature exceeds a certain limit. If you peek into most kettles, you’ll also see a temperature sensor poking its head up. This “boil-dry protection” automatically shuts off when it detects that the water has evaporated or the kettle has been left empty for too long. In the center we see the copper rings that link up with the base coupler.</p><p>But the base is where the magic really happens. In the lower left corner is a small LCD temperature display screen. On the lower right is the main button and dial. There are two toggle switches on the back. On the left, you can switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius (F/C), and on the right, you can set the kettle to hold a temperature for up to an hour. There’s also a hidden game in the Stagg EKG and Corvo EKG kettles. If you remove your kettle from the base and toggle the F/C switch back and forth, you’ll unlock a snake-like game called Wormy that you can play using the dial.</p><p>Decreasing the opacity of the lower-density snap-fit plastic exterior, we have an excellent view into the kettle base’s internal circuitry. There’s a cable strain relief entrance at the top that keeps the power cord safely connected to the device. The larger wires we see here deliver 120 V household current to the heating element. The smaller wires power the digital electronics (screen and dial).</p><p>The Fellow EKG Stagg kettle features a sophisticated PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) controller that uses a solenoid relay switch and MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor). Instead of kicking on and overshooting the target once the temperature has fallen well below it, the PID controller’s non-mechanical approach ensures uniform heating and precise temperature control with minimal fluctuations (±0.3° C). The solenoid relay and MOSFET work in series; the MOSFET flutters to modulate power supply to the heating element inside the kettle. Departing from basic on/off mechanical relays — the annoying click sound that other kettles make — Fellow’s advanced system employs Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) for gradual power adjustments.</p><p><a href="https://www.lumafield.com/article/discover-the-art-and-science-of-coffee-with-x-ray-ct">Explore the Scans</a></p></div></div></div><div role="listitem"><div id="burr-grinder"><p><img alt="Intro image for the scan." loading="lazy" src="https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2376f778a04b8e28821_Coffee_Grinder_N93A9928.png" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 50vw" srcset="https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2376f778a04b8e28821_Coffee_Grinder_N93A9928-p-500.png 500w, https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2376f778a04b8e28821_Coffee_Grinder_N93A9928-p-800.png 800w, https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2376f778a04b8e28821_Coffee_Grinder_N93A9928-p-1080.png 1080w, https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2376f778a04b8e28821_Coffee_Grinder_N93A9928.png 1500w"></p></div><div><div><h3>Burr grinder</h3><h5>Porlex, 2018</h5><p>The scientific precision characteristic of the Third and Fourth Wave of coffee culture places a premium on grind quality. Blade grinders, like in a blender, chop coffee beans with their sharp edges and get the job done quickly, but they produce grounds that are uneven in size and shape. Burr grinders offer a more consistent and precise grind size compared to blade grinders. They use two serrated components, known as burrs, to crush the coffee beans to a uniform size, resulting in a more even extraction during brewing. Burr grinders also generate less heat than blades during the grinding process, minimizing the risk of overheating the coffee grounds and preserving the delicate flavors and aromas.</p></div><div><p>This handheld burr grinder made in Japan by Porlex is perfect for on-the-go brewing, making it a great companion for an AeroPress. The stainless steel body holds 40 grams of coffee in the hopper. Instead of twisting the body like a pepper grinder, you crank the handle like an old-fashioned coffee mill to turn the internal conical burr, while the external ring burr remains stationary. Ground coffee collects in the bottom chamber, and you disassemble to retrieve it. You can see we missed a few grounds on our last cup of coffee; there are remnants in the bottom right of the chamber.</p><p>Conical burrs allow for a wider surface area, which leads to a slower and more controlled grinding process. Compared to flat burrs, conical burrs also create a more uniform particle size distribution, reducing the potential for clogs and jams. Porlex grinders use high-quality precision-milled ceramic materials. Ceramic remains sharper for longer than steel, does not rust, and imparts no metallic flavor to the coffee. Ceramic burrs have high thermal capacity and don’t warm the coffee during grinding. All of the advantages a burr grinder has over a blade grinder are taken to their highest level with ceramic burrs.</p><p>Burr grinders also have the advantage of unmatched precision in their ability to adjust grind size to suit different brewing methods. We compared our six-year-old Porlex grinder to a new one, and discovered a redesigned ring burr with additional teeth. Instead of the original six, there are now 15 steps of adjustment. Each click on the adjustment ring under the burrs changes an average of 37 microns, allowing you to dial your exact specifications for everything from cold brew to espresso.</p><p>We also compared the tiny lower teeth and found no detectable wear and only a slight misalignment between the burrs on the used grinder. Despite the somewhat labor-intensive nature of this analogue tool, the quality of its materials and construction allow it to outperform newer technologies.</p><p><a href="https://www.lumafield.com/article/discover-the-art-and-science-of-coffee-with-x-ray-ct">Explore the Scans</a></p></div></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

            <section>
<p>At 6am on 7th May 2004, Axel Gembe awoke in the small German town of Schönau im Schwarzwald to find his bed surrounded by police officers. Automatic weapons were pointing at his head and the words, "Get out of bed. Do not touch the keyboard," were ringing in his ears.</p>
<p>Gembe knew why they were there. But, bleary-eyed, he asked anyway.</p>
<p>"You are being charged with hacking into Valve Corporation's network, stealing the video game Half-Life 2, leaking it onto the internet and causing damages in excess of $250 million," came the reply. "Get dressed."</p>
<p>Seven months earlier, on 2nd October 2003, Valve Corporation director Gabe Newell awoke in the large American city of Seattle to find the source code for the game his company had been working on for almost five years had leaked onto the internet.</p>
<figure> <a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/1.jpg_xM8t2vX.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
<img alt="" height="428" loading="lazy" src="https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/1.jpg_xM8t2vX.jpg?width=690&amp;quality=75&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/1.jpg_xM8t2vX.jpg?width=690&amp;quality=75&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/1.jpg_xM8t2vX.jpg?width=690&amp;quality=75&amp;format=jpg&amp;dpr=2&amp;auto=webp 2x" width="570"> </a>
<figcaption>The town of Schönau im Schwarzwald, where Gembe was living with his father in 2003.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game had been due for release a couple of weeks earlier but the development team was behind. 12 months behind. Half-Life 2 was going to be late, and Newell had yet to admit how late. Such a leak was not only financially threatening but deeply embarrassing.</p>
<p>After a few moments pondering these immediate concerns, an avalanche of questions tumbled through Newell's mind. How had this happened? Had the leak come from within Valve? Which member of his team, having given years of their life to building the game, would jeopardise the project in the final hour?</p>
<p>If it wasn't an inside job, how the hell did it happen? Did someone have access to Valve's internal server?</p>
<p>But the question which rang out loudest of all was the one anyone who has ever had something stolen from them cannot push from their mind: who did this?</p>
</section><section>
<h2>Anticitizen One</h2>
<p>"I got into hacking by being infected myself," Gembe says today. "It was a program that pretended to be a Warcraft 3 key generator and I was stupid enough to run it. It was an sdbot, a popular general purpose malware at the time."</p>
<p>The young German soon realised what he had installed on his PC. But instead of scrubbing the malware and forgetting about it, he reverse-engineered the program to see how it worked and what it did.</p>
<p>This led him to an IRC server from which the malware was being controlled. By following the trail back, Gembe was able to track down its operator. Rather than confronting the man, Gembe began asking him questions about the malware. He had a plan.</p>
<p>"While I have a €2000 Steam account nowadays, at the time I couldn't afford to buy games," he explains.</p>
<p>"So I coded my own malware to steal CD keys in order to unlock the titles I wanted to play. It grew quickly to one of the most prominent malwares at the time, mostly because I started writing exploits for some unpatched vulnerabilities in Windows."</p>

<figcaption>At the time the source code leaked, most of us still only had a small suite of screenshots to lust after.</figcaption></figure>
</section><section>
<h2>"Follow Freeman!"</h2>
<p>On discovering the breach, Newell's first thought was to go to the police. His second was to go to the players.</p>
<p>At 11pm on 2nd October 2003, Newell <a href="http://www.halflife2.net/forums/showthread.php?10692-I-need-the-assistance-of-the-community" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted a thread</a> on the official Half-Life 2 forum titled, "I need the assistance of the community."</p>
<p>"Yes, the source code that has been posted is the HL-2 source code," he admitted in the post. Newell went on to outline the facts Valve had been able to piece together so far.</p>
<p>He explained that someone had gained access to his email account around three weeks earlier. Not only that, but keystroke recorders had been installed on various machines at the company. According to Newell, these had been created specifically to target Valve as they were not recognised by any virus-scanning applications.</p>
<p>Whoever had done this was smart, capable and specifically interested in his company. But why?</p>
</section><section>
<h2>Point Insertion</h2>
<p>Gembe's malware crimes, while undeniably exploitative and damaging, were crimes driven by a passion for games rather than profits.</p>
<p>His favourite game of all was Half-Life. In 2002, like so many fans of the series, Gembe was hungry for details about the forthcoming sequel. That's when he had the idea. If Gembe could hack into Valve's network, he might be able to find something out about the game nobody else knew yet.</p>
<p>A socially awkward loner who had endured a tough upbringing, he would gain status in the community of gamers he had adopted as his family by offering up such insider information. It was worth a try.</p>
<figure> <a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/2.jpg_B2FLwwg.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
<img alt="" height="300" loading="lazy" src="https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/2.jpg_B2FLwwg.jpg?width=690&amp;quality=75&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/2.jpg_B2FLwwg.jpg?width=690&amp;quality=75&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/2.jpg_B2FLwwg.jpg?width=690&amp;quality=75&amp;format=jpg&amp;dpr=2&amp;auto=webp 2x" width="344"> </a>
<figcaption>By July 2003 Newell knew the team wasn't going to make the 30th September release date, but he had yet to tell the community that.</figcaption></figure>
<p>"I wasn't really expecting to get anywhere," Gembe says. "But the first entry was easy. In fact, it happened by accident.</p>
<p>"I was scanning Valve's network to check for accessible web servers where I thought information about the game might have been held. Valve's network was reasonably secure from the outside, but the weakness was that their name server allowed anonymous AXFRs, which gave me quite a bit of information."</p>
<p>AXFR stands for Asynchronous Full Zone Transfer, a tool used to synchronise backup DNS servers with the same data as the primary server. But it's also a protocol used by hackers to sneak a peek at a website's data. By transferring this data, Gembe was able to discover the names of all the subdomains of <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ValveSoftware.com</a>.</p>
<p>"In the port scan logs, I found an interesting server which was in Valve's network range from another corporation named Tangis that specialised in wearable computing devices," he says.</p>
<p>"This server had a publically writable web root where I could upload ASP scripts and execute them via the web server. Valve didn't firewall this server from its internal network."</p>
<p>Gembe had found an unguarded tunnel into the network on his first attempt.</p>
<p>"The Valve PDC had an username 'build' with a blank password," he explains. "This allowed me to dump the hashed passwords for the system. At the time the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich offered an online cracker for hashes, so I was able to crack the passwords in no time."</p>
<p>"Once I had done that... Well, basically I had the keys to the kingdom."</p>
</section><section>
<h2>Entanglement</h2>
<p>At this point, Gembe wasn't bothered about covering his tracks. So far he had nothing to hide. But he wanted to ensure he would remain undetected as he explored further.</p>
<p>"All I cared about at that point was not being thrown out," he says. "But I had access to an almost unlimited amount of proxy servers, so I wasn't worried. My first job was to find a host where I could set up some sort of hideout."</p>
<p>Gembe began poking around for information about the game. He found various design documents and notes about the game's creation. This was what he had come looking for. This was why he was here.</p>
<p>As the weeks rolled by, Gembe realised nobody at Valve had noticed he was inside the company's network. He began to push a little harder.</p>
<figure> <a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/3.jpg_uAFRLY8.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
<img alt="" height="402" loading="lazy" src="https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/3.jpg_uAFRLY8.jpg?width=690&amp;quality=75&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" srcset="https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/3.jpg_uAFRLY8.jpg?width=690&amp;quality=75&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp 1x, https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/3.jpg_uAFRLY8.jpg?width=690&amp;quality=75&amp;format=jpg&amp;dpr=2&amp;auto=webp 2x" width="640"> </a>
<figcaption>Soon after the leak, images of the characters in compromising positions were distributed online, much to Newell's dismay.</figcaption></figure>
<p>That's when he hit the payload: the source code for the game he had been waiting to play for so many years.</p>
<p>The temptation was too great. On 19th September 2003, Gembe hit the download button and made off with Valve's crown jewels.</p>
<p>"Getting the source code was easy, thanks to the network performance of the Perforce client, but the SourceSafe client for the game data was horrible," he explains.</p>
<p>"Because of this I coded my own client that basically had its own transfer mechanism over TCP, detected changed files by hashing them and transferred the changes.</p>
<p>"The game didn't run on my computer. I made some code changes to get it to run in a basic form without shaders or anything, but it wasn't fun. Also, I only had the main development trunk of the game. They had so many development branches that I couldn't even begin to check them all out."</p>
<p>To this day, Gembe maintains he was not the person who uploaded the source code to the internet. But there's no denying he handed it over to whoever did.</p>
<p>"I didn't think it through," he says. "There was, of course, an element of bragging going on. But the person I shared the source with assured me he would keep it to himself. He didn't."</p>
<p>Once the game was on BitTorrent, there was no containing it.</p>
<p>"The cat was out of the bag," says Gembe. "You cannot stop the internet."</p>
</section><section>
<h2>"A Red Letter Day"</h2>
<p>The response of the community to Newell's plea for help was mixed. While many expressed their sympathy at the theft, others felt betrayed by Valve for being led to believe the game would be ready for its scheduled launch in late 2003.</p>
<p>Despite a few leads, nobody was able to provide information about who might have perpetrated the crime. The FBI became involved in the investigation but also drew blanks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the team at Valve, which had been in crunch mode for months, was left reeling by the leak. The game was costing the company $1 million a month to build and the end was still far from sight. The leak had not only caused financial damage but had demotivated a tired team. One young designer asked Newell, "Is this going to destroy the company?"</p>
<p>At 6:18am on 15th February 2004, Valve's MD received an email with a blank subject line from sender 'Da Guy'.</p>
<p>"Hello Gabe," the author began, before going on to claim responsibility for infiltrating Valve's network months earlier.</p>
<p>Newell was unsure whether to believe the story at first. But two attached documents, both of which could only have been obtained by someone with access to private areas of Valve's server, proved the sender's claims were valid.</p>
<p>Five months after Half-Life 2 was released onto the internet, long after all leads had gone cold, Newell's man had turned up on his doorstep.</p>
</section><section>
<h2>Sandtraps</h2>
<p>Why did Gembe send that email? "Because I was sorry for what happened," he says. "I wanted them to know who did this thing, and that my intention was never for things to work out the way they did."</p>
<p>But that wasn't all that Gembe was after. The young man saw a way he could create a positive outcome from his crime, both for Valve and himself. In a separate email, he asked if Newell would consider giving him a job.</p>
<p>"I was very naïve back then," he says. "It was and still is my dream to work for a game development company, so I just asked. I hoped that they could forgive what I had done, mostly because it wasn't intentional."</p>
<p>To Gembe's surprise, Newell wrote back a few days later saying yes, Valve was interested. He asked if Gembe would agree to a phone interview.</p>
<figure> <a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/eurogamer-dntiy2.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<figcaption>It's not obvious whether Valve would ever have traced Gembe if he hadn't gotten in touch with Newell directly.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The real motivation behind the suggestion was not to discover whether Gembe would be a strong candidate for a position within the company. It was to obtain an on-the-record admission from Gembe that he had been responsible for the leak. It's an old FBI trick, designed to gain a confession by appealing to a person's sense of pride.</p>
<p>Gembe had his suspicions but he pushed them to the back of his mind. "I hoped for the best," he says. "I was not the brightest kid back then."</p>
<p>He recalls the phone interview being conducted by Alfred Reynolds, developer on Counter-Strike and Steam, and Portal writer Erik Wolpaw, but says he could be wrong. (In fact, Wolpaw says he had yet to join the company at this point.)</p>
<p>"At first they wanted to know how I hacked into the network. I told them in full detail. Then they asked me about my experience and skills. I still remember they were surprised that I spoke fluent English without much of an accent."</p>
<p>The trio talked for 40 minutes. Any sense of guilt dissipated for Gembe in the presence of his heroes. But that was nothing compared to the adrenaline rush he felt when he received an invitation to a second interview. This one would be face-to-face at Valve's headquarters in Seattle, on American soil.</p>
<p>Having set the trap, Valve and the FBI needed to obtain a visa for Gembe (and his father and brother, as he had asked if they could accompany him to the US). But there were concerns about the ongoing access Gembe had to Valve's servers and the potential damage he could still cause. So the FBI contacted the German police, alerting them to the plan.</p>
</section><section>
<h2>Highway 17</h2>
<p>It was soon after this that Gembe awoke to find himself staring down the barrel of a gun. He got dressed and headed downstairs, escorted by the armed policemen squeezed into the small hallways of his father's house.</p>
<p>"Can I get something to eat before we leave?" asked Gembe.</p>
<p>"No problem," said one of the policemen.</p>
<figure> <a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/5_b81hcLL.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<figcaption>The initial level of Half-Life 2 open in Hammer.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gembe reached for a kitchen knife to cut some bread. "Every policeman in the room raised his rifle at me," he says.</p>
<p>After drinking a cup of coffee and smoking a cigarette, Gembe climbed into the back of a van and was driven to the local police station. There he was greeted by the police chief. He walked up to Gembe, looked him in the eye and said, "Have you any idea how lucky you are that we got to you before you got on that plane?"</p>
<p>Gembe was interrogated by the police for three hours. "Most of the questions they asked me were about the Sasser-Worm," he says, referring to a particularly vicious malware that affects computers running vulnerable versions of Windows XP and Windows 2000.</p>
<p> "For some reason they thought there was a connection between me and Sasser, which I denied. Sasser was big news back then and its author, Sven Jaschan, was raided the same day as me in a co-ordinated operation, because they thought I could warn him.</p>
<p>"My bot used the same vulnerability in the LSASS service that his did, except it didn't crash the host system, so I guess they thought I gave him the exploit code. Of course I denied this and told them that I never write such shoddy code."</p>
<p>After the police began to realise there was no link between Gembe and the Sasser-Worm, they moved on to asking him about Valve.</p>
<p>"I could have refused to answer and demanded an attorney, but I chose to tell them everything I knew honestly and completely, which I guess they appreciated," he says. "The guy questioning me liked me because, he said, 'You are not an asshole like most of the other guys.' That department has to deal mostly with child porn.</p>
<p>"I guess I was so open with them because I didn't believe I did much wrong, at the time."</p>
<p>Gembe was remanded in custody for two weeks. He was released once the police were determined he wasn't about to flee, with the proviso that he check-in with them three times a week, every week, for three years, until his trial.</p>
</section><section>
<h2>Our Benefactors</h2>
<p>While waiting for his day in court, Gembe worked hard to change his life. He finished an apprenticeship and got a job in the security sector, writing Windows applications to manage security systems and performing database and server administration work. </p>
<p>Axel Gembe's trial lasted for seven hours. No one from Valve was present, though someone from the Wall Street Journal turned up. Security breach aside, there was no evidence to suggest Gembe had been responsible for pushing the Half-Life 2 source code on the internet.</p>
<p>However, Gembe admitted to hacking into Valve's network. The judge sentenced him to two years' probation, citing his rough childhood and the way he had worked to turn his life around as considerations when it came to deciding on the relatively lenient punishment.</p>
<p>By the time of the trial 8.6 million copies of Half-Life 2 had been sold, its success seemingly unaffected by the leak of 4th October 2003.</p>
<figure> <a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/eurogamer-yl39d4.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<figcaption>Half-Life 2 did well, then. Although apparently not well enough to warrant a sequel...</figcaption></figure>
<p>Today Gembe is 28. Nearly a decade on, he is remorseful about the Half-Life 2 episode.</p>
<p>"I was naive and did things that I should never have done," he says. "There were so many better uses of my time. I regret having caused Valve Software trouble and financial loss. I also regret having caused some universities financial harm by using them as speed tests for my malware.</p>
<p>"Basically I regret all the illegal things I did at that time... And I regret not doing anything worthwhile with my life before I got busted."</p>
<p>What of the man he stole a game from? What would Axel Gembe say to Gabe Newell today?</p>
<p>"I would say this: I am so very sorry for what I did to you. I never intended to cause you harm. If I could undo it, I would. It still makes me sad thinking about it. I would have loved to just stay and watch you do your thing, but in the end I screwed it up.</p>
<p>"You are my favourite developer, and I will always buy your games."</p>

The recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) technology, such as GPT-4, have improved the accuracy of proposed solutions. However, since the most advanced LLMs have not been open for fine-tuning, recent work in the space has focused on creating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) algorithms that can enable complex Natural Language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) scenarios without modifying the underlying LLM.</p><p id="9046">Last week, OpenAI opened up GPT-3.5-turbo for fine-tuning. In this post, we will fine-tune our own NL-to-SQL model and compare its performance against the state of the art RAG approach. We will use the <a href="https://yale-lily.github.io/spider" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Spider dataset</a> from Yale university as our test benchmark.</p><h2 id="323a"><strong>Fine-tuning GPT-3.5-Turbo for NL-to-SQL</strong></h2><p id="686d">Like all model training and fine-tuning, the first step of fine-tuning GPT-3.5-Turbo is the creation and upload of a training dataset. Since GPT-3.5-Turbo is a ChatModel, this dataset must use to the following format, and be uploaded as a JSONL file</p><pre><span id="572b">{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "system_prompt"}, {"role": "user", "content": "user_prompt"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "assistant_prompt"}]}<br>{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "system_prompt"}, {"role": "user", "content": "user_prompt"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "assistant_prompt"}]}<br>{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "system_prompt"}, {"role": "user", "content": "user_prompt"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "assistant_prompt"}]}</span></pre><p id="f782">The Spider dataset has a holdout test set of 2147 question/SQL pairs, a development set of 1034 question/SQL pairs, and a training set of 7000 question/SQL pairs. We will build our fine-tuning dataset in the structure above from the Spider training set.</p><h2 id="4819">Creating the training dataset</h2><p id="95d8">An NL-to-SQL task is defined as follows: <strong>given a question and database, identify a SQL query that when executed against the database returns a result set that can answer the question.</strong> Various approaches have been explored on how best to prompt LLMs for this task, and it is generally agreed that the prompt needs to include an instructional component, details of the database schema, information about the database’s content, a set of task-specific demonstrations and of course the actual question at hand.</p><p id="9472">Given the format of the ChatModel training data, the elements above have to be presented within the following three prompts:</p><ul><li id="83de"><strong>system_prompt — </strong>will contain the instruction, database schema and database content</li><li id="c110"><strong>user_prompt — </strong>will contain the natural language question</li><li id="8561"><strong>assistant_prompt — </strong>where the SQL will be provided together with a reasoning step</li></ul><p id="d12f">Let’s look at how to create each of these for our NL-to-SQL training dataset.</p><p id="7733"><strong>The system prompt</strong></p><p id="77f2">Creating the system_prompt is by far the most complex part of this exercise. At a minimum, the system_prompt needs to include:</p><ol><li id="5574">The system instruction</li><li id="06fd">The DB schema</li><li id="b580">Information about the DB content</li></ol><p id="03a4">In addition, for any real-world use case with a large number of tables, the samples in the training set should also train the model to select the correct tables from the DB for the SQL query (i.e perform schema-linking).</p><p id="67ef"><strong>System Instruction</strong></p><p id="fd9a">For the instruction we used the following standard prompt</p><pre><span id="a793">You are an assistant that is an expert in generating Sqlite SQL queries.<br>Having the access to database content, generate a correct Sqlite SQL query for the given question.<br>### Database content ###</span></pre><p id="d654"><strong>Database Schema</strong></p><p id="10dd">In the literature there are many proposed prompt formats for the database schema and content with no clear consensus around which performs best. We found the following to be the optimal representation of the database schema:</p><pre><span id="c6a3">CREATE TABLE concert (<br>"concert_ID" INTEGER NOT NULL,<br>"concert_Name" TEXT NOT NULL, - the name of the concert<br>"Theme" TEXT, - theme of the concert<br>"Stadium_ID" TEXT NOT NULL,<br>"Year" TEXT, PRIMARY KEY ("concert_ID"),<br>FOREIGN KEY("Stadium_ID")<br>REFERENCES stadium ("Stadium_ID")<br>)<br>CREATE TABLE singer (<br>"Singer_ID" INTEGER NOT NULL,<br>"Name" TEXT, - name of the singer<br>"Country" TEXT NOT NULL, - country where the singer born<br>"Song_Name" TEXT NOT NULL, - the name of the song produced by the singer<br>"Song_release_year" TEXT, - The release year of the song<br>"Age" INTEGER,<br>"Is_male" BOOLEAN NOT NULL,<br>PRIMARY KEY ("Singer_ID")<br>)</span></pre><p id="df9c"><strong>Database Content</strong></p><p id="e114">After much experimentation we found the following template to perform the best at training the model about the database content:</p><pre><span id="3b3b">/*<br>Columns in concert and 3 examples in each column for the high cardinality columns :<br>concert_ID: 1025 , 1101 , 1247<br>concert_Name : "Fire", "Dance", "Sky"<br>Stadium_ID : 9, 10, 11<br>*/<br>/*<br>Columns in concert and all categories for the low cardinality columns :<br>Theme : " ROCK ", " POP ", " HIP-HOP "<br>Year : 2022, 2021, 2023, 2020<br>*/<br>/*<br>Columns in singer and 3 examples in each column for the high cardinality columns :<br>Singer_ID : 10235 , 110231 , 1242447<br>Name : "Jordan", "Gabriel", "Tiffany"<br>Country : "Iran", "India", "Canada"<br>Song_Name : "dance in the fire", "rain", "sky"<br>Age : 19, 20, 21<br>*/<br>/*<br>Columns in singer and all categories for the low cardinality columns :<br>Is_male : "MALE", "FEMALE",<br>Song_release_year : 2022, 2021, 2023, 2020<br>*/</span></pre><p id="787d">An important element in the database content is how to identify categorical (low cardinality) columns. The threshold for distinguishing between low and high cardinality columns depends on the context window size of the Large Language Model (LLM) being fine-tuned. Given the 4096 token context window of GPT-3.5-turbo, we determined 20 tokens as the appropriate threshold between low and high cardinality columns.</p><p id="cc9d"><strong>Schema Linking</strong></p><p id="41ac">The final challenge in creating the system_prompts for our training set is to provide samples in such a way that train the model to correctly perform schema-linking on the database. To do this, we employed the following heuristic: for each individual NL &lt;&gt; SQL sample we included a random selection of other tables from the DB in addition to the correct tables until we reached the context window limit of 4000 tokens. To mitigate the influence of positional information, we further randomized the order of tables. In short, each system_prompt included the schema and content of the relevant tables mixed in with other irrelevant tables, helping train the model in picking the correct tables for the query.</p><p id="bea8">We will now put all of this together to build our system_prompts.</p><p id="e2a9">For the sample below from Spider:</p><pre><span id="5c38">Question : "How many heads of the departments are older than 56 ?"<br>SQL: "SELECT count(*) FROM head WHERE age &gt; 56"</span></pre><p id="77b9">The system_prompt will be</p><pre><span id="a170">You are an assistant that is an expert in generating Sqlite SQL queries.<br>Having the access to database content, generate a correct Sqlite SQL query for the given question.<br>### Database content ###<br>CREATE TABLE trip (<br>id INTEGER, duration INTEGER,<br>start_date TEXT,<br>start_station_name TEXT,<br>start_station_id INTEGER,<br>end_date TEXT,<br>end_station_name TEXT,<br>end_station_id INTEGER,<br>bike_id INTEGER,<br>subscription_type TEXT,<br>zip_code INTEGER,<br>PRIMARY KEY (id)<br>)<br>/* Columns in trip and 3 examples in each column for high cardinality columns :<br>id : 900645, 900752, 900524<br>duration : 1131, 2146, 1155<br>start_date : 8/21/2015 17:39, 8/21/2015 17:03, 8/21/2015 17:16<br>start_station_name : Howard at 2nd, 2nd at Folsom, Market at 10th<br>start_station_id : 56, 65, 49 end_date : 8/21/2015 17:19, 8/21/2015 18:08, 8/21/2015 17:32<br>end_station_name : Howard at 2nd, 2nd at Folsom, Market at 10th<br>end_station_id : 56, 65, 49<br>bike_id : 586, 56, 65<br>zip_code : 94070, 94530, 94040–1724<br>*/<br>/* Columns in trip and all categories for low cardinality columns :<br>subscription_type : Customer, Subscriber<br>*/<p>CREATE TABLE management (<br>"department_ID" INTEGER,<br>"head_ID" INTEGER,<br>temporary_acting TEXT,<br>PRIMARY KEY ("department_ID", "head_ID"),<br>FOREIGN KEY("head_ID") REFERENCES head ("head_ID"),<br>FOREIGN KEY("department_ID") REFERENCES department ("Department_ID")<br>)<br>/* Columns in management and all categories for low cardinality columns :<br>department_ID : 7, 15, 2, 11<br>head_ID : 5, 4, 6, 3, 10<br>temporary_acting : Yes, No<br>*/</p><p>CREATE TABLE department (<br>"Department_ID" INTEGER,<br>"Name" TEXT,<br>"Creation" TEXT,<br>"Ranking" INTEGER,<br>"Budget_in_Billions" REAL,<br>"Num_Employees" REAL,<br>PRIMARY KEY ("Department_ID")<br>)<br>/* Columns in department and 3 examples in each column for high cardinality columns :<br>Department_ID : 1, 13, 11<br>Name : Energy, Interior, Health and Human Services<br>Creation : 1913, 1979, 1989<br>Ranking : 1, 13, 11<br>Budget_in_Billions : 10.7, 77.6, 59.7<br>Num_Employees : 112557.0, 3000000.0, 235000.0<br>*/</p><p>...<br>CREATE TABLE head (<br>"head_ID" INTEGER,<br>name TEXT,<br>born_state TEXT,<br>age REAL,<br>PRIMARY KEY ("head_ID")<br>)<br>/* Columns in head and all categories for low cardinality columns :<br>head_ID : 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 4, 6, 3, 10, 9<br>name : Jeff Maggert, Pádraig Harrington, Billy Mayfair, K.

</figure><p>By combining a powerful set of instruments with some experimental savvy, physicists have for the first time detected oxygen-28 — an isotope of oxygen that has 12 extra neutrons packed into its nucleus. Scientists have long predicted that this isotope is unusually stable. But initial observations of the <sup>28</sup>O nucleus suggest that this isn’t the case: it disintegrates rapidly after creation, a team reports in <i>Nature</i> today<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>. If the results can be replicated, physicists might need to update theories of how atomic nuclei are structured.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The strongest force in the Universe is the one that holds together the protons and neutrons in an atom’s nucleus. To unlock how elements are forged, the physics of neutron stars and more, scientists need to better understand this strong nuclear force, says Takashi Nakamura, a physicist at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. He and other researchers are testing theories about how atomic nuclei are held together by pushing them to extremes. One popular way is to load lightweight nuclei, such as oxygen, with excess neutrons and see what happens.</p><p>Current theories state that atomic nuclei with certain numbers of protons and neutrons are inherently stable. This is because protons and neutrons fill up ‘shells’ in the nucleus. When a shell is filled with just the right number of protons or neutrons, it becomes massively difficult to add or take away particles. These are ‘magic’ numbers, and have been thought to include 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82 and 126 particles. If a nucleus has a magic number of both neutrons and protons, it becomes ‘doubly magic’ — and therefore even more stable.</p><p>The most abundant form of oxygen, <sup>16</sup>O, is doubly magic, because of its eight protons and eight neutrons. Oxygen-28, with 8 protons and 20 neutrons, has long been predicted to be doubly magic, too. But physicists have not been able to detect it before.</p><h2>Ghost hunters</h2><p>Observing <sup>28</sup>O required several experimental feats. Key to the whole operation were the intense streams of radioactive isotopes produced by the Riken RI Beam Factory in Wako, Japan. The scientists fired a beam of calcium-48 isotopes at a beryllium target, which created a fluorine-29 isotope. The nucleus of this isotope has one more proton than does <sup>28</sup>O but the same number of neutrons. The scientists next smashed <sup>29</sup>F into a thick barrier of liquid hydrogen, knocking a proton out of the nucleus and generating <sup>28</sup>O.</p><figure>

</figure><p>This rare form of oxygen was too short-lived to be observed directly. Instead, the team detected its decay products: oxygen-24 plus four neutrons, a measurement that seemed impossible only a few years ago.</p><p>Measuring up to two neutrons at the same time has been done, but this is the first time scientists have detected four simultaneously, Nakamura says. “They are like ghosts,” he says of neutrons. With no electrical charge, neutrons can’t be wrangled in the same way that protons can (<sup>24</sup>O, with its eight positively charged protons, could be ushered into a detector with magnets). To observe individual neutrons, the team used a powerful detector built for that purpose, on loan from the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany, in addition to Riken’s instruments. In this specialized detector, incoming neutrons are revealed when they knock protons around. Nakamura says that the study’s lead author, Tokyo Institute of Technology physicist Yosuke Kondo, used simulations to help to verify these tricky measurements.</p><p>“They’ve really done their homework,” says Robert Janssens, a physicist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “They did all the checks you could do. It’s a tour de force.”</p><h2>Atomic limits</h2><p>Although the team wasn’t able to get an exact measurement of the lifetime of <sup>28</sup>O, Nakamura says that the isotope did not behave as if it were doubly magic — it fell apart almost as soon as it came into existence.</p><p>“I was surprised,” he says. “Personally, I thought it was doubly magic. But this is what nature says.”</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>This is not the first hint that nuclear physicists’ list of magic numbers is not universally applicable, says Rituparna Kanungo, a physicist at Saint Mary’s University in Halifax, Canada. She was part of a team of scientists that showed in 2009 that <sup>24</sup>O — contrary to the nuclear rulebook — has a nucleus that behaves as though it is doubly magic<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>. Its 8 protons and 16 neutrons are strongly bound to one another, giving it a relatively long lifetime — it takes about 61 milliseconds for half of the <sup>24</sup>O to disappear through radioactive decay. This means that in some nuclei, if they are strongly bound, 16 could be a magic number, too.</p><p>“Magic numbers are not immutable,” Janssens says.</p><p>For now, the confounding qualities of <sup>28</sup>O raise a whole host of questions about the forces that hold nuclei together. Physicists are daydreaming about possible next steps. Nakamura wants to see whether it’s possible to detect oxygen-30. Because the stability of different isotopes is a relative measurement, it would be helpful to compare <sup>28</sup>O with this heavier, yet-unseen, near neighbour.</p><p>“It’s so simple and so complicated,” Janssens says. “We don’t know at the moment how many protons and neutrons you can put together in a nucleus” and have them stay bound together, he adds. “In other words, what’s the limit?”</p>

There was just one problem: His proof, which was more than 500 pages long, was completely impenetrable. It relied on a snarl of new definitions, notation, and theories that nearly all mathematicians found impossible to make sense of. Years later, when two mathematicians translated large parts of the proof into more familiar terms, they pointed to what one called a “<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/titans-of-mathematics-clash-over-epic-proof-of-abc-conjecture-20180920/">serious, unfixable gap</a>” in its logic — only for Mochizuki to reject their argument on the basis that they’d simply failed to understand his work.</p>
<p>The incident raises a fundamental question: What is a mathematical proof? We tend to think of it as a revelation of some eternal truth, but perhaps it is better understood as something of a social construct.</p>
<p><a href="https://dms.umontreal.ca/~andrew/expository.php">Andrew Granville</a>, a mathematician at the University of Montreal, has been thinking about that a lot recently. After being contacted by a philosopher about some of his writing, “I got to thinking about how we arrive at our truths,” he said. “And once you start pushing at that door, you find it’s a vast subject.”</p>
<p>Granville enjoyed arithmetic from an early age, but he never considered a career in mathematics research because he didn’t know such a thing existed. “My father left school at 14, my mother at 15 or 16,” he said. “They were born in what was then the working-class area of London, and university was just beyond what they saw as possible. So we had no clue.”</p>
<p>After graduating from the University of Cambridge, where he studied math, he started adapting <em>The Rachel Papers</em>, a novel by Martin Amis, into a screenplay. While working on and seeking funding for the project, he wanted to avoid taking a desk job — he’d worked at an insurance company during a gap year between high school and college and didn’t want to return to it — “so I went to grad school,” he said. The film never got off the ground (the novel was later independently made into a movie), but Granville got a master’s degree in math and then moved to Canada to complete his doctorate. He never looked back.</p>
</div></div><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>“It was an adventure, really,” he said. “I didn’t really go in expecting much. I didn’t really know what a Ph.D. was.”</p>
<p>In the decades since, he has authored more than 175 papers, mostly in number theory. He’s also become well known for writing about math for a popular audience: In 2019, he co-authored a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Prime-Suspects-Anatomy-Integers-Permutations/dp/0691149151">graphic novel</a> about prime numbers and related concepts with his older sister, Jennifer, a screenwriter. Last month, one of his papers on “how we arrive at our truths” was <a href="https://mxphi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Granville.pdf">published</a> in the Annals of Mathematics and Philosophy. And along with other mathematicians, computer scientists and philosophers, he is planning to publish a collection of articles in next year’s <em>Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society</em> about how machines might change mathematics.</p>
<p><em>Quanta </em>spoke with Granville about the nature of mathematical proof — from how proofs work in practice to popular misconceptions about them, to how proof-writing might evolve in the age of artificial intelligence. The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p>
<h3><strong>You recently published a paper on the nature of mathematical proof. Why did you decide that this was important to write about?</strong></h3>
<p>How mathematicians go about research isn’t generally portrayed well in popular media. People tend to see mathematics as this pure quest, where we just arrive at great truths by pure thought alone. But mathematics is about guesses — often wrong guesses. It’s an experimental process. We learn in stages.</p>
<p>For example, when the Riemann hypothesis first appeared in a paper in 1859, it was like magic: Here’s this amazing conjecture, out of nowhere. For 70 years, people talked about what a great thinker can do by pure thought alone. Then the mathematician Carl Siegel found Riemann’s scratch notes in the Göttingen archives. Riemann had actually done pages of calculations of zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Siegel’s famous words were, “So much for pure thought alone.”</p>
<p>So there is this tension in the way people write about mathematics — some philosophers and historians in particular. They seem to think that we’re some pure magical creature, some unicorn of science. But we’re not, typically. It’s rarely pure thought alone.</p>

<p>The culture of mathematics is all about proof. We sit around and think, and 95% of what we do is proof. A lot of the understanding we gain is from struggling with proofs and interpreting the issues that come up when we struggle with them.</p>
<h3><strong>We often think of a proof as a mathematical argument. Through a series of logical steps, it demonstrates that a given statement is true. But you write that this shouldn’t be mistaken for pure, objective truth. What do you mean by that?</strong></h3>
<p>The main point of a proof is to persuade the reader of the truth of an assertion. That means verification is key. The best verification system we have in mathematics is that lots of people look at a proof from different perspectives, and it fits well in a context that they know and believe. In some sense, we’re not saying we know it’s true. We’re saying we hope it’s correct, because lots of people have tried it from different perspectives. Proofs are accepted by these community standards.</p>
<p>Then there’s this notion of objectivity — of being sure that what is claimed is right, of feeling like you have an ultimate truth. But how can we know we’re being objective? It’s hard to take yourself out of the context in which you’ve made a statement — to have a perspective outside of the paradigm that has been put in place by society. This is just as true for scientific ideas as it is for anything else.</p>
<p>One can also ask what is objectively interesting or important in mathematics. But this is also clearly subjective. Why do we consider Shakespeare to be a good writer? Shakespeare wasn’t as popular in his own time as he is today. There are obviously social conventions around what’s interesting, what’s important. And that depends on the current paradigm.</p>
</div></div><figure><div><p><img alt="Two photographs showing Granville’s finger scanning through a copy of a 19th-century mathematical text." src="https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2023/08/AndrewGranville-byAlexTran-diptych-scaled.webp"></p></div><figcaption><div><p>Granville inherited this copy of a 19th-cenutry mathematical text, the 1811 Cribrum Arithméticum by Ladislaud Chernac, when a colleague passed it to him in his will.</p><p>Alex Tran for <em>Quanta Magazine</em></p></div></figcaption></figure><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><h3><strong>In math, what does that look like?</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most famous examples of a change in paradigm is calculus. When calculus was invented, it involved dividing something that’s going toward zero by something else that’s going toward zero — leading to zero divided by zero, which doesn’t have any meaning. Initially, Newton and Leibniz came up with objects called infinitesimals. It made their equations work, but by today’s standards it wasn’t sensible or rigorous.</p>
<p>We now have the epsilon-delta formulation, which was introduced at the end of the 19th century. This modern formulation is so stunningly, obviously good for getting these concepts right that when you look at the old formulations, you’re like, what were they thinking? But at the time, that was considered the only way you could do it. To be fair to Leibniz and Newton, they probably would have loved the modern way. They didn’t think to do it, because of the paradigms of their era. So it just took an awfully long time to get there.</p>

<p>The problem is, we don’t know when we’re behaving like that. We’re entrapped in the society we’re in. We don’t have an outside perspective to say what assumptions we’re making. One of the dangers in mathematics is that you can conceive of something as not being important because it’s not easily expressed or discussed in the language you’ve chosen to use. It doesn’t mean you’re right.</p>
<p>I really like this quote by Descartes, where he essentially says: “I think I know everything there is to know about a triangle, but who’s to say I do? I mean, somebody in the future might come up with a radically different perspective, leading to a much better way of thinking about a triangle.” And I think he’s right. You see that in mathematics.</p>
<h3><strong>As you wrote in your paper, you can think of a proof as a social compact — a sort of mutual agreement between the author and their mathematical community. We’ve seen an extreme example of this not working, with Mochizuki’s claimed proof of the <em>abc</em> conjecture.</strong></h3>
<p>It’s extreme, because Mochizuki did not want to play the game in the way it’s played. He has made this choice to be obscure. When people make big breakthroughs, with really new and difficult ideas, I feel it’s incumbent on them to try and include other people by explaining their ideas in as accessible a way as possible. And he was more like, well, if you don’t want to read it the way I wrote it, that’s not my problem. He has the right to play the game he wants to play. But it’s nothing to do with community. It’s nothing to do with the ways that we make progress.</p>
</div></div><figure><div><p><img alt="Granville writing on a blackboard in front of four seated students." src="https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2023/08/AndrewGranville-byAlexTran-Blackboard-scaled.webp"></p></div><figcaption><div><p>“We get on and try to prove what we can,” said Granville.</p><p>Alex Tran for <em>Quanta Magazine</em></p></div></figcaption></figure><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><h3><strong>If proofs exist in a social context, how have they changed over time?</strong></h3>
<p>It all starts with Aristotle. He said that there needs to be some sort of deductive system — that you can only prove new things by basing them on things you already know and are certain of, going back to certain “primitive statements,” or axioms.</p>
<p>So then the question is: What are those basic things that you know to be true? For a very long time, people just said, well, a line is a line, a circle is a circle; there are a few things that are simple and obvious, and those should be the assumptions we start from.</p>

<p>That perspective has lasted forever. It’s still around today to a large extent. But the Euclidean axiomatic system that developed — “a line is a line” — had its problems. There were these paradoxes discovered by Bertrand Russell based on the notion of a set. Moreover, one could play word games with the mathematical language, creating problematic statements like “this statement is false” (if it’s true, then it’s false; if it’s false, then it’s true) that indicated there were problems with the axiomatic system.</p>
<p>So Russell and Alfred Whitehead tried to create a new system of doing math that could avoid all these problems. But it was ludicrously complicated, and it was hard to believe that these were the right primitives to start from. Nobody was comfortable with it. Something like proving 2 + 2 = 4 took a vast amount of space from the starting point. What’s the point of such a system?</p>
<p>Then David Hilbert came along and had this amazing idea: that maybe we shouldn’t be telling anyone what’s the right thing to start with at all. Instead, anything that works — a starting point that’s simple, coherent and consistent — is worth exploring. You can’t deduce two things from your axioms that contradict each other, and you should be able to describe most of mathematics in terms of the selected axioms. But you shouldn’t a priori say what they are.</p>
<h3><strong>This, too, seems to fit into our earlier discussion of objective truth in math. So at the turn of the 20th century, mathematicians were realizing that there could be a plurality of axiomatic systems — that one given set of axioms shouldn’t be taken as a universal or self-evident truth?</strong></h3>
<p>Right. And I should say, Hilbert didn’t start off doing this for abstract reasons. He was very interested in different notions of geometry: non-Euclidean geometry. It was very controversial. People at the time were like, if you give me this definition of a line that goes around the corners of a box, why on earth should I listen to you? And Hilbert said that if he could make it coherent and consistent, you should listen, because this may be another geometry that we need to understand. And this change in viewpoint — that you can allow any axiomatic system — didn’t just apply to geometry; it applied to all of mathematics.</p>
<p>But of course, some things are more useful than others. So most of us work with the same 10 axioms, a system called ZFC.</p>

<p>Which leads to the question of what can and can’t be deduced from it. There are statements, like the continuum hypothesis, which cannot be proved using ZFC. There must be an 11th axiom. And you can resolve it either way, because you can choose your axiomatic system. It’s pretty cool. We continue with this sort of plurality. It’s not clear what’s right, what’s wrong. According to Kurt Gödel, we still need to make choices based on taste, and we hopefully have good taste. We should do things that make sense. And we do.</p>
<h3><strong>Speaking of Gödel, he plays a pretty big role here, too.</strong></h3>
<p>To discuss mathematics, you need a language, and a set of rules to follow in that language. In the 1930s, Gödel proved that no matter how you select your language, there are always statements in that language that are true but that can’t be proved from your starting axioms. It’s actually more complicated than that, but still, you have this philosophical dilemma immediately: What is a true statement if you can’t justify it? It’s crazy.</p>
<p>So there’s a big mess. We are limited in what we can do.</p>
<p>Professional mathematicians largely ignore this. We focus on what’s doable. As Peter Sarnak likes to say, “We’re working people.” We get on and try to prove what we can.</p>

It doesn’t mean you’re right,” said Granville.</p><p>Alex Tran for <em>Quanta Magazine</em></p></div></figcaption></figure><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><h3><strong>Now, with the use of not just computers but even AI, how is the notion of proof changing?</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve moved to a different place, where computers can do some wild things. Now people say, oh, we’ve got this computer, it can do things people can’t. But can it? Can it actually do things people can’t? Back in the 1950s, Alan Turing said that a computer is designed to do what humans can do, just faster. Not much has changed.</p>
<p>For decades, mathematicians have been using computers — to make calculations that can help guide their understanding, for instance. What AI can do that’s new is to verify what we believe to be true. Some terrific developments have happened with proof verification. Like [the proof assistant] Lean, which has allowed mathematicians to verify many proofs, while also helping the authors better understand their own work, because they have to break down some of their ideas into simpler steps to feed into Lean for verification.</p>
<p>But is this foolproof? Is a proof a proof just because Lean agrees it’s one? In some ways, it’s as good as the people who convert the proof into inputs for Lean. Which sounds very much like how we do traditional mathematics. So I’m not saying that I believe something like Lean is going to make a lot of errors. I’m just not sure it’s any more secure than most things done by humans.</p>
<p>I’m afraid I have a lot of skepticism about the role of computers. They can be a very valuable tool for getting things right — particularly for verifying mathematics that rests heavily on new definitions that are not easy to analyze at first sight. There’s no debate that it’s helpful to have new perspectives, new tools and new technology in our armory. But what I shy away from is the concept that we’re now going to have perfect logical machines that produce correct theorems.</p>

<p>You have to acknowledge that we can’t be sure things are correct with computers. Our future has to rely on the sense of community that we have relied on throughout the history of science: that we bounce things off one another. That we talk to people who look at the same thing from a completely different perspective. And so on.</p>
<h3><strong>Where do you see this going in the future, though, as these technologies get more sophisticated?</strong></h3>
<p>Perhaps it could assist in creating a proof. Maybe in five years’ time, I’ll be saying to an AI model like ChatGPT, “I’m pretty sure I’ve seen this somewhere. Would you check it out?” And it’ll come back with a similar statement that’s correct.</p>
<p>And then once it gets very, very good at that, perhaps you could go one step further and say, “I don’t know how to do this, but is there anybody who’s done something like this?” Perhaps eventually an AI model could find skilled ways to search the literature to bring tools to bear that have been used elsewhere — in a way that a mathematician might not foresee.</p>
<p>However, I don’t understand how ChatGPT can go beyond a certain level to do proofs in a way that outstrips us. ChatGPT and other machine learning programs are not thinking. They are using word associations based on many examples. So it seems unlikely that they will transcend their training data. But if that were to happen, what will mathematicians do? So much of what we do is proof. If you take proofs away from us, I’m not sure who we become.</p>

<p>Regardless, when we think about where we’re going to take computer assistance, we need to take into account all the lessons we’ve learned from human endeavor: the importance of using different languages, working together, carrying different perspectives. There’s a robustness, a health, in how different communities come together to work on and understand a proof. If we’re going to have computer assistance in mathematics, we need to enrich it in the same way.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="RADEON" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/radeon.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
With the in-development Linux 6.6 kernel <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.6-DRM-Graphics-Drivers">adding support for more upcoming Radeon graphics processors</a>, that means more auto-generated header files for the new IP blocks... I was curious to see the overall size now of the AMDGPU kernel driver along with its associated code like the AMDKFD compute driver. It's now above 5 million lines for the kernel driver portion.
</p><p>
Following the DRM-Next merge to Linux 6.6, I ran some <em>cloc</em> stats on the AMD Linux kernel graphics driver code. In particular, the <em>drivers/gpu/drm/amd/</em> area that contains the modern code around the AMDGPU DRM driver with AMDKFD compute, display code, common header files, etc (but not counting the older "Radeon" driver in <em>drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/</em>). This open-source AMD Linux kernel graphics driver amounts to more than 5 million lines:
</p><pre>    2173 text files.
    2172 unique files.                                          
       5 files ignored.

</pre>
<p>Of course, much of that is auto-generated header files... A large portion of it with AMD continuing to introduce new auto-generated header files with each new generation/version of a given block. These verbose header files has been AMD's alternative to creating exhaustive public documentation on their GPUs that they were once known for.
</p><p>
Meanwhile the open-source NVIDIA "Nouveau" driver is around 201k (21.7k blank lines, 24.3k lines of comments, and 155k lines of code). Or the Intel i915 DRM kernel graphics driver is around 381k lines via the same cloc judgment.
</p><p>
It's also worth reminding users that this is just the kernel graphics driver code and not counting all of the code within Mesa for providing the OpenGL and Vulkan driver support or other user-space components.
</p><p>
The entire Linux kernel source tree as of this morning comes in at around 34.8 million lines, including the documentation, various in-tree utilities/tools, other helpers, etc. That figure is from 4,414,747 blank lines, 4,246,577 lines of comments, and 26,168,342 detected lines of code.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>I’ve been thinking recently about anti-racism and what it looks like to support
colleagues from underrepresented groups at work. The other day someone in a
Slack group made an offhand comment that they’d sent a message to an engineer’s
manager to say that the engineer was doing exceptional work.</p>

<p>I think telling someone’s manager they’re doing great work is a pretty common
practice and it can be really helpful, but it’s easy to forget to do and I wish
someone had suggested it to me earlier. So let’s talk about it!</p>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1280918150289281025">tweeted about this to ask how people approach it</a> and as usual I got a ton of great replies that I’m going to summarize here.</p>

<p>We’re going to talk about what to say, when to do this, and why you should ask first.</p>

<h3 id="ask-if-it-s-ok-first">ask if it’s ok first</h3>

<p>One thing that at least 6 different people brought up was the importance of
asking first. It might not be obvious why this is important at first — you’re
saying something positive! What’s the problem?</p>

<p>So here are some potential reasons saying something positive to someone’s
manager could backfire:</p>

<ol>
<li>Giving someone a compliment that’s not in line with their current goals. For
example, if your coworker is trying to focus on becoming a technical expert
in their domain and you’re impressed with their project management skills,
they might not want their project management highlighted (or vice versa!).</li>
<li>Giving someone the wrong “level” of compliment. For example, if they’re a
very senior engineer and you say something like “PERSON did
SIMPLE_ROUTINE_TASK really well!” — that doesn’t reflect well on them and
feels condescending. This can happen if you don’t know the person’s position
or don’t understand the expectations for their role.</li>
<li>If your coworker was supposed to be focusing on a specific project, and
you’re complimenting them for helping with something totally unrelated,
their manager might think that they’re not focusing on their “real” work.
One person mentioned that they got reprimanded by their manager for getting
a spot peer bonus for helping someone on another team.</li>
<li>Some people have terrible managers (for example, maybe the manager will feel
threatened by your coworker excelling)</li>
<li>Some people just don’t like being called out in that way, and are happy with
the level of recognition they’re getting!</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall: a lot of people (for very good reasons!) want to have control over the
kind of feedback their manager hears about them.</p>

<p>So just ask first! (“hey, I was really impressed with your work on X project
and wanted to send this note to $MANAGER to explain how important your work
because I know she wasn’t that involved in X project and might not have seen
everything you did, is that ok with you?”)</p>

<h3 id="when-it-s-important-to-highlight-work-that-isn-t-being-recognized">when it’s important: to highlight work that isn’t being recognized</h3>

<p>Okay, now let’s talk about when this is important to do. I think this is pretty
simple – managers don’t always see the work their reports are doing, and if
someone is doing really amazing work that their manager isn’t seeing, they
won’t get promoted as quickly. So it’s helpful to tell managers about work that
they may not be seeing.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of types of important work that might be underrecognized:</p>

<ul>
<li>work by someone from another department (maybe their manager doesn’t
understand how helpful their contribution was to the company because they
don’t work with your team that much, but your coworker’s work made a huge
difference!)</li>
<li>work that happened in a private channel (for example if someone spent hours
helping you with something 1:1 and it really made a big difference to the
success of your project)</li>
<li>work preventing problems, which often isn’t as visible as firefighting work</li>
<li>work by people from underestimated groups (maybe your coworker’s work isn’t
being recognized as much as it should be because of racism/sexism/etc!)</li>
<li>documentation/code review/other kinds of work that aren’t always as visible
as programming</li>
<li>work by remotes (if remote work is less visible at your company)</li>
<li>work by someone in a role that’s typically underrecognized (someone mentioned
support as an example)</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, everyone agreed that it’s always great to highlight the contributions of
more junior coworkers when they’re doing well.</p>

<h3 id="why-it-matters-it-helps-managers-make-a-case-for-promotion">why it matters: it helps managers make a case for promotion</h3>

<p>For someone to get promoted, they need evidence that they’ve been doing
valuable work, and managers don’t always have the time to put together all that
evidence. So it’s important to be proactive!</p>

<p>You can work on this for yourself by writing a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/">brag
document</a>, but having statements from
coworkers explaining how great your work really helps build credibility.</p>

<p>So providing these statements for your coworkers can help them get recognized
in a timely way for the great work they did (instead of getting promoted a year
later or something). It’s extra helpful to do this if you know the person is up
for promotion.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-do-it-be-specific-explain-the-impact-of-their-work">how to do it: be specific, explain the impact of their work</h3>

<p>Pretty much everyone agreed that it’s helpful to explain what specifically the
person did that was awesome (“X did an incredible job of designing this system
and we haven’t had any major operational issues with it in the 6 months since
it launched, which is really unusual for a project of that scale”).</p>

<h3 id="how-to-do-it-highlight-when-they-re-exceeding-expectations">how to do it: highlight when they’re exceeding expectations</h3>

<p>Because the point is to help people get promoted, it’s important to highlight
when people are exceeding expectations for their level, for example if they’re
not a senior engineer yet but they’re doing the kind of work you’d expect from
a senior engineer.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-do-it-send-the-person-the-message-too">how to do it: send the person the message too</h3>

<p>We already basically covered this in “ask the person first”, but especially if
I’m using a feedback system where the person might not get the feedback
immediately I like to send it to them directly as well. It’s nice for them to
hear and they can also use it later on!</p>

<h3 id="public-recognition-can-be-great-too">public recognition can be great too!</h3>

<p>A couple of folks mentioned that they like to give public recognition, like
mentioning how great a job someone did in a Slack channel or team meeting.</p>

<p>Two reasons public recognition can be good:</p>

<ol>
<li>It helps build credibility for your colleague</li>
<li>It lets the person you’re recognizing be part of the
conversation/reciprocate to the feedback-giver, especially if the work was a
collaboration.</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, it’s good to ask about this before doing this – some people dislike
public recognition.</p>

<h3 id="on-peer-bonuses">on peer bonuses</h3>

<p>A few people who work at Google (or other companies with peer bonuses)
mentioned that they prefer to give peer bonuses for this because it’s a more
official form of recognition.</p>

<p>Lots of people mentioned other forms of feedback systems that they use instead
of email. Use whatever form of recognition is appropriate at your company!</p>

<h3 id="anyone-can-do-this">anyone can do this</h3>

<p>What I like about this is it’s a way everyone can help their coworkers – even
if you’re really new and don’t feel that qualified to comment on how effective
someone more senior is at their job, you can still point out things like “this
person helped me do a project that was really out of my comfort zone!”</p>

<h3 id="maybe-expand-the-set-of-people-you-do-this-for">maybe expand the set of people you do this for!</h3>

<p>I think it’s very common for people to promote the work of their friends in
this way. I’ve tried to expand the set of people I do this for over time – I
think it’s important to keep an eye out for coworkers who are really excelling
and to make sure their work is recognized.</p>



<p>I wanted to just talk about this one specific practice of telling someone’s
manager they’re doing great work but there are a LOT of other ways you can help
lift your coworkers up. Lara Hogan’s post <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/what-sponsorship-looks-like/">what does sponsorship look
like?</a> has a lot of
great examples.</p>

<p>Mekka Okereke has a wonderful Twitter thread about another way you can support
underrepresented folks: by being a <a href="https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1027552459873378304">“difficulty anchor”</a>. It’s
short and definitely worth a read.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/31/23853618/x-privacy-policy-update-biometrics-job-history">https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/31/23853618/x-privacy-policy-update-biometrics-job-history</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37338585">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>X, the platform previously known as Twitter, is expanding the amount of data it collects on users. The social network has updated its <a href="https://twitter.com/en/privacy#x-privacy-1">privacy policy</a> to include carveouts for “biometric information” and “employment history,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-31/x-plans-to-collect-user-biometric-data-job-and-education-history?sref=ExbtjcSG">as spotted by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>.</p><p>“Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes,” the privacy policy reads. It doesn’t include any details on what kind of biometric information this includes — or how X plans to collect it — but it typically involves fingerprints, iris patterns, or facial features. </p><p>X Corp. was named in a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jnswire/jns-media/4e/52/13288870/2023ch06416.pdf">proposed class action lawsuit</a> in July over claims that its data collection violates the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The lawsuit alleges that X “has not adequately informed individuals” that it “collects and/or stores their biometric identifiers in every photograph containing a face” that’s uploaded to the platform.</p><p>One possibility for using biometric data is enabling passwordless sign-ins. According to <a href="https://www.thetapedrive.com/p/x-twitter-and-linkedin-to-support">findings from app developer Steve Moser</a>, X plans on rolling out support for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/5/23293643/apple-passkeys-fido-alliance-passwordless-google-microsoft">passkeys</a>, which can use your device’s fingerprint, facial recognition, or PIN to log in to your account.</p><p>The privacy policy adds that X may also collect “your employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, job search activity and engagement.” That’s likely related to the job search features that X owner Elon Musk has hinted at including. The platform <a href="https://twitter.com/XHiring/status/1695154429828247798?s=20">rolled out the beta of a hiring feature</a> for companies last week and <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1697145283472244974?s=20">also plans on adding video and audio calls</a> with “no phone number needed.”</p><p>The current privacy policy, <a href="https://twitter.com/en/privacy#twitter-privacy-1">which you can read here</a>, makes no mention of the collection of biometric data or information related to employment history. According to a notice at the top of the page, the new policy doesn’t go into effect until September 29th, 2023.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>IBM has returned to the facial recognition market — just three years after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21284683/ibm-no-longer-general-purpose-facial-recognition-analysis-software">announcing it was abandoning work on the technology</a> due to concerns about racial profiling, mass surveillance, and other human rights violations.</p><p>In June 2020, as Black Lives Matter protests swept the US after George Floyd’s murder, IBM chief executive Arvind Krishna <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200609031426/https:/www.ibm.com/blogs/policy/facial-recognition-susset-racial-justice-reforms/">wrote a letter to Congress</a> announcing that the company would no longer offer “general purpose” facial recognition technology. “The fight against racism is as urgent as ever,” he wrote. “IBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent with our values and Principles of Trust and Transparency.” Later that year, the company redoubled its commitment, calling for US export controls to address concerns that facial recognition could be used overseas “to suppress dissent, to infringe on the rights of minorities, or to erase basic expectations of privacy.”</p><p>Despite these announcements, last month, IBM signed a $69.8 million (£54.7 million) contract with the British government to develop a national biometrics platform that will offer a facial recognition function to immigration and law enforcement officials, according to documents reviewed by <em>The Verge</em> and <a href="https://libertyinvestigates.org.uk/">Liberty Investigates</a>, an investigative journalism unit in the UK.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Notice/021422-2023?origin=SearchResults&amp;p=1">contract notice</a> for the Home Office Biometrics Matcher Platform outlines how the project initially involves developing a fingerprint matching capability, while later stages introduce facial recognition for immigration purposes — described as “an enabler for strategic facial matching for law enforcement.” The final stage of the project is described as delivery of a “facial matching for law enforcement use-case.”</p><div><p>The Home Office Biometrics Matcher Platform includes “strategic” matching of photos in a database</p></div><p>The platform will allow photos of individuals to be matched against images stored on a database — what is sometimes known as a “one-to-many” matching system. In September 2020, IBM described such “one-to-many” matching systems as “the type of facial recognition technology most likely to be used for mass surveillance, racial profiling, or other violations of human rights.”</p><p>IBM spokesman Imtiaz Mufti denied that its work on the contract was in conflict with its 2020 commitments. “IBM no longer offers general-purpose facial recognition and, consistent with our 2020 commitment, does not support the use of facial recognition for mass surveillance, racial profiling, or other human rights violations,” he said.</p><p>“The Home Office Biometrics Matcher Platform and associated Services contract is not used in mass surveillance. It supports police and immigration services in identifying suspects against a database of fingerprint and photo data. It is not capable of video ingest, which would typically be needed to support face-in-a-crowd biometric usage.”</p><p>Human rights campaigners, however, said IBM’s work on the project is incompatible with its 2020 commitments. Kojo Kyerewaa of Black Lives Matter UK said: “IBM has shown itself willing to step over the body and memory of George Floyd to chase a Home Office contract. This won’t be forgotten.”</p><p>Matt Mahmoudi, PhD, tech researcher at Amnesty International, said: “The research across the globe is clear; there is no application of one-to-many facial recognition that is compatible with human rights law, and companies — including IBM — must therefore cease its sale, and honor their earlier statements to sunset these tools, even and especially in the context of law and immigration enforcement where the rights implications are compounding.”</p><div><p>“There is no application of one-to-many facial recognition that is compatible with human rights law.”</p></div><p>Police use of facial recognition has been linked to wrongful arrests in the US and has been challenged in the UK courts. In 2019, an independent report on the London Metropolitan Police Service’s use of live facial recognition found there was no “explicit legal basis” for the force’s use of the technology and raised concerns that it may have breached human rights law. In August of the following year, the UK’s Court of Appeal ruled that South Wales Police’s use of facial recognition technology breached privacy rights and broke equality laws. The force paused its use of facial recognition after the verdict but has since resumed using the technology.</p><p>Other tech firms have imposed partial bans on the use of their facial recognition services for law enforcement. In the days after IBM declared its plans to leave the facial recognition sector, Amazon and Microsoft both announced moratoriums on the sale of their facial recognition services to police departments in the US.</p><p>Amazon initially announced a one-year moratorium on police use of its Rekognition software in June 2020 and said it would be extending the ban “indefinitely” the following year. A spokeswoman for the company confirmed that the moratorium, which prohibits “use of Amazon Rekognition’s face comparison feature by police departments in connection with criminal investigations,” is still in place.</p><p>Microsoft said in June 2020 that it would not sell facial recognition software to US police departments until a national law is introduced governing use of the technology. When contacted by <em>The Verge</em> and Liberty Investigates, a spokeswoman for Microsoft referred to the company’s website, which states that use of the Azure AI Face service “by or for state or local police in the US is prohibited by Microsoft policy.”&nbsp;</p><p>The UK Home Office did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <div><p><span><strong>MINNEAPOLIS/ST. PAUL (08/22/2023) —</strong>A team of University of Minnesota Medical School researchers successfully tested a new antifungal therapy to treat fungal meningitis. The trial results were published today in the peer-reviewed journal </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciad440/7246927?searchresult=1"><span>Clinical Infectious Diseases</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The research team tested a new oral formulation of the antifungal medication amphotericin among people who had HIV and cryptococcal meningitis—a common fungal infection around the brain. Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common cause of central nervous system infection in people living with HIV worldwide. Conventional amphotericin B can only be administered directly into veins and is highly toxic. The new lipid nanocrystal formulation—which was tested in the EnACT trial—can be taken orally and is non-toxic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“An orally administered amphotericin that is effective against nearly all fungus and non-toxic sounds like the holy grail of antifungal medicines. While further clinical trials are needed in other fungal conditions, the EnACT trial establishes proof of concept for the safe and effective treatment of invasive fungal infections,” said </span><a href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/david-boulware"><span>David Boulware</span></a><span>, MD, MPH, an infectious disease physician and professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School and M Health Fairview. Dr. Boulware is also the senior investigator of the EnACT trial.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In this randomized trial, 141 HIV-positive people with cryptococcal meningitis received the oral amphotericin combined with oral flucytosine. This combination was found to be promising for cryptococcal meningitis in regard to antifungal activity, similar survival and less toxicity in comparison to intravenous amphotericin B. Statistically fewer lab abnormalities occurred with the six weeks of LNC-enabled oral amphotericin B compared to one week of intravenous amphotericin B. In the group given two IV loading doses then the experimental oral amphotericin formulation, 90% of participants survived &gt;4 months compared to 85% who received one week of standard intravenous amphotericin.</span></p><p><span>“With the rising incidence of life-threatening fungal infections, our currently available conventional methods are limited by rising rates of drug resistance and toxicities,” said </span><a href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/mahsa-abassi"><span>Mahsa Abassi</span></a><span>, DO, assistant professor at the U of M Medical School and co-investigator on the trial. “The development of new antifungal regimens that are orally available, less toxic, and can treat highly resistant fungal infections is crucial.”</span></p><p><span>The trial was conducted in partnership with researchers from the U of M’s Medical School,&nbsp; School of Public Health, the Infectious Diseases Institute of Makerere University in Uganda and Matinas BioPharma, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“We are very pleased that the important EnACT data are being shared with the clinical and scientific community at large through publication in this peer-reviewed journal,” said Theresa Matkovits, PhD, and Chief Development Officer of Matinas. “The results from EnACT in cryptococcal meningitis and our experience with patients enrolled in our ongoing Compassionate/Expanded Use Access Program support our belief that MAT2203 has the potential to become an important part of the regimen for treatment of invasive fungal infections, including in the highest-need patients who require longer-term treatment and have limited or no treatment options.&nbsp; The publication of the EnACT data in Clinical Infectious Diseases is yet another milestone for our development program. We would like to thank all the EnACT participants, our dedicated investigators, and the entire clinical study team in Uganda for their commitment to this important clinical trial.”</span></p><p><span>Funding for the EnACT trial was provided by the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>###</span></p><p><span><strong>About the University of Minnesota Medical School</strong></span></p><p><span>The University of Minnesota Medical School is at the forefront of learning and discovery, transforming medical care and educating the next generation of physicians. Our graduates and faculty produce high-impact biomedical research and advance the practice of medicine. </span><a href="https://med.umn.edu/odei/about/commitments-acknowledgements"><span>We acknowledge</span></a><span> that the U of M Medical School, both the Twin Cities campus and Duluth campus, is located on traditional, ancestral and contemporary lands of the Dakota and the Ojibwe, and scores of other Indigenous people, and we affirm our commitment to tribal communities and their sovereignty as we seek to improve and strengthen our relations with tribal nations.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/30/usenet_revival/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/30/usenet_revival/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37336606">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The USENET management committee has reconvened and there are green shoots of growth in the original, pre-World Wide Web social network.</p>
<p>USENET, or NetNews, is a text-only social discussions forum, or rather a set of a great many forums, called "newsgroups," carried by multiple servers around the world. Although the original developers <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2010/05/20/usenet_duke_server/">closed down</a> their instance in 2010, that was just one server out of hundreds, and many are still running just fine. It never went away – it's still alive, you can get on it for free, and there is a choice of client apps for most OSes to help you navigate.</p>
<p>Although USENET is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network, the Big-8 board is the closest thing it has to a central governing authority. Board member <a target="_blank" href="https://www.big-8.org/wiki/User:Tristan_Miller" rel="nofollow">Tristan Miller</a> told <em>The Reg</em>: "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.big-8.org/wiki/User:Jason_Evans" rel="nofollow">Jason Evans</a> and I <a target="_blank" href="https://www.big-8.org/wiki/Press_releases/2020-11" rel="nofollow">re-established the Board</a> in 2020, after a long period of dormancy. We were joined a few months later by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.big-8.org/wiki/User:Rayner_Lucas" rel="nofollow">Rayner Lucas</a>."</p>

    

<p>Among other things, the board manages the list of newsgroups, and now that there's an active board again, it has been busy. It deleted some very old groups at the moderators' request, and added the first new newsgroup in many years for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/27/gemini_protocol/">the Gemini protocol</a>. If you have a News client, news:comp.infosystems.gemini ought to open it. The board has also revamped the website, run a Reddit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nn4vp8/were_the_usenet_big8_management_board_ask_us/" rel="nofollow">Ask Me Anything session</a>, updated the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.algebra.com/~ichudov/stump/" rel="nofollow">GNU Stump</a> and WebStump packages used by moderators, and more.</p>

        


        

<p>USENET is older than the web, and works more like email: servers carry a list of newsgroups, and sync messages with each other. Although the original developers <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2010/05/20/usenet_duke_server/">closed down</a> their instance in 2010, that was just one server out of hundreds.</p>
<p>(One of the things that contributed to the downfall of USENET was when people worked out how to post binary files, encoded as multi-part blocks of ASCII text.

<p>Getting online is pretty easy. Get an account on a USENET server. Install a client, tell it the server address. Download the list of groups, subscribe to some, and new messages get delivered to your client. That's it.</p>
<p><em>The Reg</em> FOSS desk uses a service called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eternal-september.org/" rel="nofollow">Eternal September</a>, after the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September" rel="nofollow">event</a> when AOL added USENET access to its internet client and tens of thousands of newbies flooded in without knowing the rules. We'll give you one hint: scrupulously follow the "netiquette" of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/23/email_like_a_pro/">plain-text, bottom-posted email</a>.</p>

        

<p>Eternal September only carries text groups, no binaries, but it offers totally free accounts, whereas some higher-capacity servers such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eweka.nl/en" rel="nofollow">Eweka</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://giganews.com/" rel="nofollow">Giganews</a> charge for access.</p>
<p>As for a client – well, as we mentioned <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/26/new_betas_of_firefox_and_tbird/">when introducing their new ESR versions</a>, we use Thunderbird. It's free, it works, and it runs on all the big desktop OSes. There are lots out there, though. Even <a target="_blank" href="https://groups.google.com/" rel="nofollow">Google Groups</a> is still alive, if woefully neglected.</p>
<p>As a big science fiction reader, this vulture enjoys dipping into <code>rec.arts.sf.written</code> and <code>rec.arts.sf.fandom</code>. The computer history group <code>alt.folklore.computers</code> is still pretty busy. There is life in several retrocomputing channels, and we've been enjoying talking about Acorn RISC OS and Fortran among other things. ®</p>

							<p>India recently achieved a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/23/1195411957/india-joins-an-elite-club-as-first-to-land-a-spacecraft-near-the-moons-south-pol">space exploration milestone</a> by becoming the first nation to land a rover on the Moon’s mysterious south pole. The ambitious <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/Chandrayaan3_Details.html">Chandrayaan-3</a> mission’s rover <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragyan_(rover)">Pragyan</a> has begun using its onboard instruments to study this unexplored frontier up close. Early results reveal the rover’s groundbreaking capabilities to analyze lunar soil composition, with potential implications for discovering frozen water.</p>
<p>Pragyan’s instruments are unlocking clues about the elemental makeup of the lunar surface near the south pole. A specialized <a href="https://appliedspectra.com/technology/libs.html">Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy</a> (LIBS) tool became the first equipment to ever perform in-situ measurements of this region’s composition. By shooting intense laser pulses at the soil, LIBS can induce plasma emissions that identify elemental signatures.</p>
<p>ISRO announced the rover’s LIBS results definitively confirm the <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/LIBSResults.html">presence of sulfur</a> at the landing site. Additionally, preliminary scans detect traces of aluminum, iron, calcium, chromium, titanium, manganese, silicon, and oxygen in the soil. Further hydrogen detection efforts are underway.</p>
<p>These atomic ingredients offer initial glimpses into the south pole’s geological story. LIBS provides a versatile technique to chemically analyze alien soils faster than traditional sample returns.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.livemint.com/science/news/chandrayaan3-what-happens-to-vikram-lander-and-pragyan-rover-after-14-days-heres-what-you-should-know-11692854593821.html">Pragyan’s two-week surface mission</a> will continue employing LIBS and other tools to scan for water ice deposits thought to exist in the permanently shadowed craters of the south pole. Finding accessible water sources could benefit future lunar habitation and deep space exploration.</p>
<p>India overcame <a href="https://www.theweek.in/news/sci-tech/2019/11/16/how-did-chandrayaan-2-fail-isro-answer.html">past setbacks</a> to achieve this south pole milestone. The country boldly envisions Chandrayaan-3 inaugurating an ambitious lunar exploration program. With the rover already making history through its technical innovations, India’s lunar dreams appear brighter than ever.</p>

<p>NASA officials sounded an alarm Tuesday about the agency's Deep Space Network, a collection of antennas in California, Spain, and Australia used to maintain contact with missions scattered across the Solar System.</p>
<p>Everything from NASA's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/nasa-leader-warns-agency-needs-more-funding-to-fly-artemis-missions/">Artemis missions to the Moon</a> to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/08/voyager-2-phones-home-and-says-everything-is-cool/">Voyager probes in interstellar space</a> rely on the Deep Space Network (DSN) to receive commands and transmit data back to Earth. Suzanne Dodd, who oversees the DSN in her position at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, likes to highlight the network's importance by showing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/07/the-webb-telescope-just-offered-a-revelatory-view-of-humanitys-distant-past/">gorgeous images from missions like the James Webb Space Telescope</a> and the Perseverance rover on Mars.</p>
<p>"All these images, and all these great visuals for the public, and all the science for the scientists come down through the Deep Space Network," Dodd said Tuesday in a meeting of the NASA Advisory Council's Science Committee.</p>
<h2>DSN is in deep&nbsp;sh!#</h2>
<p>But Dodd doesn't take a starry-eyed view of the challenges operating the Deep Space Network. She said there are currently around 40 missions that rely on the DSN's antennas to stay in communication with controllers and scientists back on Earth. Another 40-plus missions will join the roster over the next decade or so, and many of the 40 missions currently using time on the network will likely still be operating over that time.</p>
<p>"We have more missions coming than we currently are flying," Dodd said. "We’re nearly doubling the load on the DSN. A lot of those are either lunar exploration or Artemis missions, and a lot of Artemis precursor missions with commercial vendors. So the load is increasing, and it’s very stressful to us.”</p>
<p>“It’s oversubscribed, yet it’s vital to anything the agency wants to do," she said.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/vint-cerf-internet-competition-has-evaporated-since-dial-up/">Vint Cerf</a>, an Internet pioneer who is now an executive at Google, sits on the committee Dodd met with Tuesday. After hearing from Dodd and other NASA managers, Cerf said: "The deep space communications system is in deep—well, let me use a better word, deficit. There’s a four-letter word that occurs to me, too."</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1158020682.jpg" data-height="1000" data-width="1500" alt="An antenna at NASA's Deep Space Network station near Madrid."><img alt="An antenna at NASA's Deep Space Network station near Madrid." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1158020682-640x427.jpg" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1158020682-1280x853.jpg 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1158020682.jpg" data-height="1000" data-width="1500">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> An antenna at NASA's Deep Space Network station near Madrid.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because astronauts are involved, the Artemis missions will come with unique requirements on the DSN.</p>
<p>"We're not going to have bits of data. We're going to have gigabits of data," said Philip Baldwin, acting director of the network services division at JPL. "I don't want 1080p for video resolution. I want 8K video."</p>
<p>Each of the three stations on the Deep Space Network has a 70-meter (230-foot) dish antenna, the largest antennas in the world for deep space communications. Each location also has at least three 112-foot (34-meter) antennas. The oldest of the large antennas in California entered service in 1966, then was enlarged to its 70-meter diameter in 1988.</p>
<p>“We have reached a really critical point on the DSN’s aging infrastructure," said Sandra Cauffman, deputy director of NASA's astrophysics division.</p>
<h2>Artemis I case study</h2>
<p>Dodd presented some numbers from late last year to highlight the problem. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/12/after-decades-of-false-starts-nasa-really-is-returning-to-the-moon-this-time/">During the Artemis I mission</a>, NASA's Orion spacecraft spent about 25 days traveling from Earth to a distant orbit around the Moon, then returned to a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. The Deep Space Network's antennas collectively spent 903 hours tracking and communicating with the Orion spacecraft during Artemis I.</p>
<p>But there's more to the story. There were 10 small rideshare secondary payloads that flew into deep space on the Space Launch System rocket on Artemis I. These CubeSats ranged in size from a shoebox to a briefcase, with small antennas and low-power transmitters that required large antennas on Earth to make a reliable connection.</p>
<p>Eight of these CubeSats were tracked with the DSN, according to Dodd. "They got 871 hours of tracking, nearly as much as Artemis for eight little CubeSats," she said.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure who thought it was a good idea to put up (so many) CubeSats with Artemis I," Dodd said.</p>

The unbundling is largely targeted at enterprises, as Microsoft will keep bundling Teams in its Microsoft 365 Business plans that are offered to small businesses. Microsoft will also offer a no Teams option, priced at €1 less per month for the Business Basic plan or €2 less per month for Business Standard or Premium plans.</p><p>Alongside the Teams unbundling, Microsoft is also planning to improve its documentation on interoperability with Microsoft 365 and Office 365 for rivals like Zoom and Slack to integrate into Exchange, Outlook, and Teams.

Slack alleged that Microsoft had “illegally tied” its Microsoft Teams product to Office and is “force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers.” </p><p>Microsoft will now have to wait on EU regulators to decide whether its unbundling of Teams from Office suites in EU markets is enough. “We believe these changes balance the interests of our competitors with those of European business customers, providing them with access to the best possible solutions at competitive prices,” says Linde. “We also recognize that we are still in the early stages of the European Commission’s formal investigation. We will continue to engage with the Commission, listen to concerns in the marketplace, and remain open to exploring pragmatic solutions that benefit both customers and developers in Europe.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

		<p><span>I</span><span>t is</span>, in fact, possible to have a decent time on Goodreads. You just have to ignore everything about the way the site is designed and how you’re supposed to use it. When I first signed up in early 2012, I obeyed all the prompts. I populated my “to-read” shelf with the platform’s recommendations. I followed the pages of my favourite writers, as if Nabokov and Kafka were going to start posting updates. I papered my profile with quotes by Sigmund Freud and Philip Roth and deadpanned that my favourite books were simply “the big ones.” I didn’t mind all the beige, the slowness of the search feature, the sense that, if I turned around too quickly, I might catch the platform taking a nap. The site catered to my undergraduate hunger for pretension, my need to perform my taste—a flame it continues to fan very capably in its users.</p>

<p>Gradually, things started to go off the rails. My to-read list ballooned alarmingly, not from titles I felt drawn to out of genuine desire but ones the algorithm pushed on me. The thrill of discovery, too, felt compromised: every time my feed told me a friend had added a book that I’d found first, I felt a frisson of annoyance. <em>Have some imagination</em>. Then, after I posted a review of a recently published novel, the author reached out to thank me for it. I froze. The review had been positive, but that wasn’t the point—I thought this was a private party, not the town square. There were <em>writers</em> here? Just hanging around and <em>watching</em> us? The pressure to moderate my ratings for an invisible audience was immediate. It was one thing to show off for my friends; this felt like a reminder that the stakes were people’s livelihoods. It was my first hint that Goodreads wasn’t—or wasn’t only—a place for readers to gather and connect. It was trying to cater to authors and publishers too—groups whose priorities are very different.</p>

<p>On the surface, Goodreads seems to have mission clarity. It bills itself as “the world’s largest site for readers and book recommendations” and frames its function as one of community making: “to help people find and share <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/category/books/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">books</a> they love” (though recent headlines would suggest it’s closer to the opposite). In practice, Goodreads is great for many things, but none of them includes what it’s ostensibly “for.” I still use the site daily—but only because I abandoned that first profile and set up a second, anonymous one that ignores its purpose as a social network. Instead, I use it to get a rough and ready sense of how a book might be selling based on the number of ratings and the speed at which they accrue. I use it to drop five stars on upcoming books by friends, giving their work a tiny boost in a landscape where a book can live or die based on hype. I use it to check when a paperback edition comes out or to see which country got the better cover design. In exchange, I accept that parts of the site randomly vanish between desktop and mobile, or that a single typo while looking for a book makes the search function collapse, or that, some days, it decides <em>audiobook</em> is the only format in existence. </p>
<p>The awfulness of the user experience is surprising, given Amazon’s purchase of Goodreads in 2013. The acquisition had the potential to make the platform a major channel for book sales and marketing, though consensus seems to be that Amazon has largely abandoned it. The resulting site and its splintering purposes often feel incoherent. As an experience, it’s not entirely clear who it’s for, where its responsibilities lie, and what its function should be in a rapidly changing literary ecosystem. But despite the site’s muddied purposes and tendency to breed controversy, the book industry is still dependent on it, even beholden to it. As books coverage declines and marketing budgets shrink, Goodreads offers a rare way to get a title in front of a huge audience—approximately 90 million users—of self-selecting readers. It runs buzzy giveaway campaigns, author interviews, and lists rounding up the season’s biggest books. All these features are aimed at getting a fraction of those 90 million readers to click that prized “to-read” button, a crude prediction of that book’s future in the marketplace.</p>
<p>With so many stakeholders aiming to drive up the number of reviews, the genre of the review itself takes on an outsize significance. Much has been written about the practice of “review bombing”—when users flood a forthcoming book with one-star reviews out of an agenda rather than textual engagement. The point isn’t for people to talk smack about a book they didn’t like but to hurt the fate of one they probably haven’t read and that probably isn’t out yet. Goodreads’ lack of content moderation, and the ensuing capacity to spook authors into decisive action, has been a problem for at least four years. It was an issue in 2019, at the peak of the conversation about sensitivity readers, when a number of authors delayed or pulled their books because reader reviews criticized them for cultural misrepresentations. It was an issue again in June this year, when <em>Eat, Pray, Love</em> author Elizabeth Gilbert <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/12/1181714943/elizabeth-gilbert-halts-new-book-release-russia-ukraine" rel="noopener" target="_blank">decided to indefinitely delay</a> her new book’s publication after Goodreads users objected to a <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/russia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Russia</a>-set book following the country’s invasion of <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/ukraine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ukraine</a>. Though Goodreads told the <em>New York Times</em> it has improved its process for flagging “suspicious reviews” and “taken steps to improve its ability to detect and remove content that violates the site’s community guidelines,” it’s obviously still a problem. </p>

<p>When the Gilbert news broke, the headlines were both widespread and familiar. The <em>Times</em> led with “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/26/books/goodreads-review-bombing.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How Review-Bombing Can Tank a Book before It’s Published</a>.” <em>The Atlantic</em> condemned “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/goodreads-review-bombing-amazon-moderation/674811/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Wrath of Goodreads</a>.” Bestselling author Rebecca F. Kuang—whose latest novel, <em>Yellowface</em>, is a satire about the publishing industry’s own racial insensitivity—wrote in the <em>Guardian</em> that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/25/goodreads-is-right-to-divide-opinions-wrong-to-boil-them-down" rel="noopener" target="_blank">disagreement on the site</a> is “a sign of a lively, healthy reading culture” but problems come when it devolves into simplistic claims of moral righteousness. In a rare piece that centred the experience of the reader rather than the agonies of the writer, Greta Rainbow <a href="https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/books/a44567428/the-gamification-of-reading-is-changing-how-we-approach-books/#" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explored</a> how the site gamifies reading and influences other people’s purchasing behaviours. Controversy, Rainbow argues, only reinforces this goal: “by exerting influence and extracting attention, Goodreads is working exactly as it should.” Running through these pieces like a refrain was the aggrieved affirmation of the site’s importance as a tool for garnering pre-publication buzz.</p>
<p>Given Goodreads’ status as a load-bearing pillar of publicity, it’s surprising that it’s never really taken off as a promotional tool for writers, especially when it explicitly offers the option to be one. Tucked in like an afterthought—not mentioned on the “About” page or in its list of purposes—is the Goodreads Author Program. Stephen King is a member. So is Colleen Hoover. “It rarely ends well when authors barge into spaces meant for readers,” wrote Kuang in the <em>Guardian</em>. In general, she’s right. But, as I was so shocked to discover in 2012, this space is meant to be for authors too—a place where they can set up a profile, do Q&amp;As with their fans, blog, and share their own reading material. </p>
<p>For a site that professes to serve readers and readers alone, having a program where authors can enter the fray seems like it muddies the waters even further. Where the guiding ethos of the “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/guidelines" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Review Philosophy</a>” for users is largely “be honest and have fun,” on the writer’s side, things are more censorious. “The community perceives you as a public figure,” it warns, “and we expect you to act professionally”—a hard pill to swallow if you’re getting review-bombed. Plus, its functionality is just bad. I’ve been trying to sign up since my first book got a retail page, but for whatever reason, every time Goodreads asks me, “Are you Tajja Isen, author of the books below?” and I give all the required documentation, I can never convince it that the answer is yes. </p>
<p>Which leaves me with only one way to relate to the platform as an author: reading reviews about my own work. I’d never dare write to a reader unprompted, even to thank them for saying I changed their life. Or to engage in good faith with one-star Stacy, who called me a “mixed race woman pretending to own African American women’s struggle” [sic]. Believe it or not, in the Wild West of Goodreads, there’s a rule against authors replying to something like that.</p>

                                  <p>Tati Bruening, a 22-year-old content creator and photographer, just wants to share memes and post about cooking green beans. Every time she logs onto Instagram, however, her feed is swamped by a combination of perfectly curated photos and professionally created content.</p><p>"It's really bizarre to me that everyone's gone to this place in their mind that content has to be so curated," Bruening told us. "So curated that you can't show what you're cooking for dinner, because that's not cool enough."&nbsp;</p><p>Frustrated with the state of the platform, Bruening launched the "Make Instagram Instagram Again'' crusade in 2022. Using her handle, Illumitati, the campaign pushed back against the platform's changes that prioritized algorithmically suggested videos over a chronological feed of accounts you follow. Thousands of users, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kylie-jenner-kim-kardashian-instagram-stop-trying-to-be-tiktok-2022-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">even some celebrities like Kylie Jenner</a>, got on board. Soon enough, Instagram scaled back its aggressive recommendations push.&nbsp;</p><p>At the core of Bruening's frustration was a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kim-kardashian-kylie-jenner-smarter-than-mark-zuckerberg-instagram-changes-2022-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">sea change that had swept across Instagram</a>: Instead of everyday photos from regular people, the platform had become a curated platform where even seemingly authentic content was meticulously planned.&nbsp;</p><p>The fatigue average people feel when it comes to posting on Instagram has pushed more users toward private posting and closed groups. Features like Close Friends (a private list of people who have access to your content) and the rise of group chats give people a safer place to share memes, gossip with friends, and even meet new people. It's less pressure — <em>they won't mind if I didn't blur out the pimple on my forehead</em> — but this side of Instagram hardly fulfills the original free-flowing&nbsp; promise of social media.</p><p>"There's this very weird, unspoken social standard of what's allowed on Instagram," Bruening said. "I know that for my age group, it's like you give up on it entirely, and then you just post only to your Close Friends or alternate accounts. There's this sublayer of Instagram that's much more true to what the app once was, but it is just not viewable to the general public."</p><p>Bruening isn't alone. Despite the efforts of big incumbents and buzzy new apps, the old ways of posting are gone, and people don't want to go back. Even <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagrams-adam-mosseri-spills-on-podcast-threads-creator-monetization-dms-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, admitted</a> that users have moved on to direct messages, closed communities, and group chats. Regularly posting content is now largely confined to content creators and influencers, while non-creators are moving toward sharing bits of their lives behind private accounts.</p><p>As more people have been confronted with the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/entrepreneur-mental-health-social-media-instagram-tiktok-2022-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">consequences of constant sharing</a>, social media has become less social and more media — a constellation of entertainment platforms where users consume content but rarely, if ever, create their own. Influencers, marketers, average users, and even social-media executives agree: Social media, as we once knew it, is dead.</p><h2><strong><em>Social</em></strong><strong> media to social </strong><strong><em>media</em></strong></h2><p>No app better defines the changing nature of social media than Instagram. The app started as a digital scrapbook — a place to keep up with real-world connections, close friends, and family. While other networks had more users (Facebook) or generated more news (Twitter), <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-app-how-it-looked-at-launch-2010-2019-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Instagram seemed to define</a> the ideal form of this era of social media. Instagram became a verb, an aesthetic, and a generational signifier.</p><p>"You sort of end up in this world that is beautiful and you are following your friends and following your family," Jeffrey Gerson, a former Instagram product-marketing manager, told us about the early days of the app. "How often do you get the chance to see the world through your second cousin's eyes?"</p><p>But as Instagram grew up, things began to change. Sarah Frier, a Bloomberg tech reporter and editor and the author of "No Filter," which chronicles the history of Instagram, wrote that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21506016/instagram-10-year-anniversary-sarah-frier-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">users learned curation</a> from the introduction of photo filters. After filters and editing tools came hashtags, an explore tab, and the option to privately save people's photos. What was once an enjoyable pastime became a minefield of considerations: What should I say in the caption? Are emojis still cool? Is it better to just stay mysterious and let the images speak for themselves? This running list of questions made the posting process overwhelming, robbing Instagram of its early magic.</p><blockquote><q>There's this very weird, unspoken social standard of what's allowed on Instagram.</q></blockquote><p>As posting became higher stakes, new features also pushed users away from the original mission: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-data-reveals-how-instagram-reels-photos-compare-engagement-reach-2022-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Instagram began prioritizing video</a>, then livestreaming, and then shopping. Each change muddled the purpose of Instagram even further. Everyday people were still posting to the platform, but more and more of the content became professionalized. Bloggers brought their audience, editing skills, and expensive cameras to the platform. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-do-instagram-influencers-make-money" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Influencers started to snag brand deals</a>, and fashion bloggers made the platform into a career. Instagram encouraged the rise of influencers with programs that helped creators understand best practices, gave them technical support, and set up discreet payment programs.</p><p>Today, the app has become an aspirational entertainment app — a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-influencers-are-key-to-social-commerce-shopping-2021-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">place where users can shop</a>, find information, and get inspired (or, more commonly, overwhelmed) by snapshots of the best moments of a person's life. Nearly every photo on Instagram now is hand selected from an album of dozens of nearly identical images. The only difference is the one you're seeing isn't too perfect but just perfect enough for sharing. These shifts had a downstream effect on everyday users: The cadence of posting content changed. "Your friends don't post that much to feed," Mosseri admitted during a recent interview on the "20VC" podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>Hannah Stowe, a 23-year-old who lives in New York, said that while she uses Instagram every day, she rarely finds herself posting these days. "I used to post on Instagram weekly/bimonthly, but now it's much less frequent, like four or five times a year," she told us in a DM. "I add stories more impulsively but way less than I used to. Now it's probably like once a week. If that."</p><p>While sharing has tailed off, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-surpasses-instagram-time-spent-us-adults-emarketer-8-2023" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">consuming content hasn't slowed</a>, especially since the start of the pandemic, Andrea Casanova, an influencer strategist, told us. When people were confined to their homes, the apps saw an influx of photos "from people who either have a specific lifestyle or had specific talents," she said. This, in turn, reinforces typical people's decision to not post on their own feeds, Casanova said, because they assume the bar for what people want to see is higher.</p><p>"Culture in general has kept a lot of people from showing up because they don't think their life is aesthetic, or they don't think that they're selling anything, so why would they post on social media? 'I just don't have the lifestyle that all of these creators have, so I don't know what I would be sharing' and therefore fall into this loop of never sharing anything," Casanova said.</p><p>As users post less and less to Instagram, new apps have tried to stake their claim as the next big thing. The French social-media app BeReal, which gained popularity for its more authentic experience, peaked at 75 million downloads per analytics firm Sensor Tower and a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bereal-buzzy-gen-z-social-media-app-raise-630m-valuation-2022-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">$630 million</a> valuation. Growth has stalled a year later, with a monthly active user base of 51 million, a sliver of Instagram's 1.4 billion. Other apps like Dispo, Poparazzi, and Locket have all used various gimmicks to try and recapture social media's halcyon days — each had a moment in the sun at the top of the US Apple app-store charts — but none have truly broken through. Even ByteDance, which has the same parent company as TikTok, failed to recapture the fading magic with the photo-sharing platform Lemon8.</p><blockquote><q>I'm honestly just tired of social media. I'm tired of consuming content all the time.</q></blockquote><p>And now there is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-instagram-threads-is-destined-to-be-boring-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Threads, Instagram's latest play</a> in the space to fill the void that was left as Twitter has undergone so much volatility. While Mosseri has hailed the text-focused platform as a "less angry place for conversations, " Threads' daily active-user count is down 79% a month after it launched — to 10.3 million daily active users, data from Similarweb found. Even with the backing of Meta, Threads may not have the juice to make it through, because it doesn't offer users a new way to interact. It follows in the footsteps of other buzzy startups that rise to the top for weeks, even days, before users get bored. The core issue is that these apps don't solve anything new. They are mostly copycat versions of each other.&nbsp;</p><p>"People are looking for that 'groundbreaking app,' and we still haven't gotten that yet," Casanova said.</p><h2><strong>It's going down in the DMs</strong></h2><p>In an era where a lot of frequent social-media users are sick of being "<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkbpk7/its-normal-to-feel-anxious-about-being-seen-and-perceived-after-covid-pandemic-v28n2" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">perceived</a>" and having hundreds, or even thousands, of eyes on them, many are retreating to the days of tighter connections and communities.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm honestly just tired of social media," said 23-year-old Walid Mohammed, who works in the creator economy. "I'm tired of consuming content all the time."&nbsp;</p><p>And if Instagram was the bellwether for the rise and fall of the "social" social-media era, it is also a harbinger of this new era. "If you look at how teens spend their time on Instagram, they spend more time in DMs than they do in stories, and they spend more time in stories than they do in feed," Mosseri said during the "20VC" interview. Given this changing behavior, Mosseri said the platform has shifted its resources to messaging tools. "Actually, at one point a couple years ago, I think I put the entire stories team on messaging," he said.&nbsp;</p><p>These closed spaces aren't just more private than the Instagrams and TikToks of social media, however — they also offer something algorithms can't serve: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/discords-website-for-videogaming-and-sneaker-reselling-cook-group-hub-2020-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">niche communities</a>.</p><p>"You have this really interesting countermovement backwards into these much smaller and much more hyper-specific communities," said Gerson, who recently has helped grow Castro Labs, a queer social-media startup.</p><p>That opens the door for new apps that can capitalize on the more direct sharing preferences of the younger generation. Discord, for instance, has grown to nearly 170 million monthly average users — it could even be on a path to an IPO. Other, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/geneva-vs-clubhouse-discord-chat-app-gen-z-users-creators-2022-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">smaller apps such as Geneva</a> have also provided new ways to connect with people locally or with similar interests. For instance, the content creator Nina Haines launched a group called SapphLit, a self-described "sapphic book club born out of the queer BookTok community."</p><p>Victoria Johnston, a 22-year-old software engineer, imagines the ideal social-media platform as a "safe space where people can just connect and you don't feel pressured to have a big following or a presence or be really well known." Johnston, like many others, wants to go beyond a screen. She wants a social network that helps her find community in her everyday life.</p><p>"On a space like Geneva or any kind of group networking or chatting app, you're just trying to connect with people with like-minded backgrounds and you're not trying to prove anything to anyone," Johnston said. "You're really just finding those niche communities that you probably wouldn't be able to find on a major social-media app."</p><p>And as more users and creator communities migrate toward closed spaces, the behemoths like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-testing-group-profiles-collaborate-creators-2022-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Instagram are also trying to capitalize</a> on this reality by introducing features like paid-subscription services that offer exclusive group chats.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><q>You have this really interesting countermovement backwards into these much smaller and much more hyper-specific communities.</q></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/creator-economy-influencer-marketing-experts-to-follow-linkedin-newsletters-podcasts-2023-5#lia-haberman-is-a-college-professor-who-writes-a-weekly-newsletter-breaking-down-the-latest-influencer-marketing-news-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Lia Haberman,</a> an adjunct professor at UCLA Extension and an advisor for the American Influencer Council, said that Gen Alpha, the age cohort of 13 and younger, are "not embracing traditional social-media platforms and customs." This presents a problem for influencers and brands, since smaller, more direct spaces are harder to penetrate.</p><p>"How does a brand show up in somebody's DMs or Discord server if they're not invited?" Haberman said. But in many ways, that's the point. People can still go on Instagram to check on their favorite celebrities and influencers, but young people don't want brands and marketers infiltrating the closed communities where they spend most of their time.</p><p>Social media promised to create an intricate web that brought us all closer to one another, but the wave of exposure led to an openness that many people just aren't interested in. Most people wouldn't let the first person they stop on the street sift through their camera roll. They want their achievements, failures, and little life moments to be kept sacred. So after a decade of airing our most intimate moments in public, the pendulum is shifting back. People are more selective with their communities and are reverting back to an old-school way of interacting. It's hard to know how the change will affect the online atmosphere over the long term — some evidence suggests the shift will <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/social-media-twitter-facebook-political-polarization-mechanism-2022-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">create a healthier digital experience</a>, but it also risks further dividing people into like-minded echo chambers.</p><p>Whatever the result, it's clear that the Instagram era of social media is over and the new era of "authentic" online sharing is emerging — just without an audience.</p><hr><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/amanda-perelli" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Amanda Perelli</a> is a senior creator economy reporter covering social media influencers, advertising and marketing trends for Insider.<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/sydney-bradley" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Sydney Bradley</a> is a senior reporter covering the creator economy, influencers, and tech for Insider.&nbsp;</p></em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div disabled="" sortable="">
          <p dir="auto">FWIW, a while ago I created an MIT-licensed OSS project <a href="https://github.com/paraterraform/para"><code>para</code></a> to manage terraform plugins. If I recall correctly, this was out even before Terraform Registry (TFR) was GA.</p>
<p dir="auto">The idea behind <code>para</code> is to provide greater control over package indices, as well as an option to maintain personal or fully local indices. What it means is that one can use a Github repo to build out a community repo, or each plugin maintainer can provider their own feed which can be referenced on per-project basis.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'd imagine that unless there is way to make things working with TFR [without violating licenses], <code>para</code> can be used as an alternative, or can inspire plugin management system to be built within OpenTF.</p>
<p dir="auto">I haven't used Terraform for a while so IDK if HashiCorp broke the interface used by <code>para</code> (in which case it should be easy to fix <code>para</code>,  or extend OpenTF to provide a new and more convenient integration interface fir plugin management).</p>
<p dir="auto">P.S.: I used FUSE in <code>para</code> to inject TF-compatible file structures and plugin contents in runtime to avoid need for extra configuration, but in retrospective a FUSE-less mode powered by an additional config file to pre-load plugins would've been a great addition. This one you would only need to invoke <code>para</code> once to rebuild TF plugin dir whenever you need to change/update plugin versions, rather than on every invocation.</p>
<p dir="auto">P.P.S.: Pun intended in a form of "para-terraform," as in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Paraterraforming involves the construction of a habitable enclosure on a planet which eventually grows to encompass most of the planet's usable area.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">UTM SE</h2>
<p dir="auto">UTM/QEMU requires dynamic code generation (JIT) for maximum performance. JIT on iOS devices require either a jailbroken device, or one of the various workarounds found for specific versions of iOS (see "Install" for more details).</p>
<p dir="auto">UTM SE ("slow edition") uses a <a href="https://github.com/ktemkin/qemu/blob/with_tcti/tcg/aarch64-tcti/README.md">threaded interpreter</a> which performs better than a traditional interpreter but still slower than JIT. This technique is similar to what <a href="https://github.com/ish-app/ish">iSH</a> does for dynamic execution. As a result, UTM SE does not require jailbreaking or any JIT workarounds and can be sideloaded as a regular app.</p>
<p dir="auto">To optimize for size and build times, only the following architectures are included in UTM SE: ARM, PPC, RISC-V, and x86 (all with both 32-bit and 64-bit variants).</p>

But with the crypto world crashing that spring, the stock never took off. Within months, Applied Blockchain pivoted again — renaming itself Applied Digital.</p><p>If its previous iteration had been too late to cash in on the bitcoin mining craze, the company wasn’t going to miss the next big one: artificial intelligence.</p>
    

<p>Applied Digital’s stock finally began to soar in May,<b> </b>when CEO Wes Cummins announced that the company had signed a cloud hosting deal potentially worth $180 million with an unnamed but prominent AI customer, and another one for up to $460 million with another big player in the booming AI space. By July, the stock had surged some 450 percent for the year, becoming — for a time, at least — one of the big winners in today’s AI-driven stock market.</p><div data-category-uppercase="true" data-sponsored="true"><a aria-label="Alpha Opportunities in Emerging Markets" href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/2c1111olwhbe42u6talfk/innovation/alpha-opportunities-in-emerging-markets" data-cms-ai="0"><picture>

<p>Applied Digital is hardly alone in trying to capture some AI magic. Ever since ChatGPT burst onto the scene last November — with its “large language model” boasting a humanlike writing capability that at first blush seems to ensure productivity gains for everyone from publishers and movie studios to investment banks and hedge funds — so-called “generative AI” has turned the markets on their heads.</p>
    

<p>Coming off the worst year in recent history for venture capitalists, private market players like Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue Management, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital, and Softbank quickly redirected their dollars to AI upstarts. Meanwhile, the stock prices of the big tech names suspected to be the major beneficiaries of this often-called “revolutionary” form of artificial intelligence have skyrocketed. The 2022 tech downturn became a faint memory as some five tech companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia — accounted for the lion’s share of the stock market’s remarkable comeback this year, with the S&amp;P 500 rising 20 percent through July. Nvidia, maker of the superfast chips that switched from powering bitcoin mining to making generative AI possible, has gained more than 250 percent so far in 2023, making it the S&amp;P index’s top gainer.</p><p>In the midst of this bonanza, Applied Digital’s CEO — who is also the president of B. Riley Asset Management and was at one point the owner of about 25 percent<b> </b>of Applied Digital’s shares — posted on Twitter (now X) in June that the company had ordered 26,000<b> </b>top-tier H100 GPUs, or video processing cards, from Nvidia for $40,000 apiece. To those casting a wary eye on the company, it seemed too good to be true. A purchase that big would allow Applied Digital to “jump to the top of the pile in high-performance computing, alongside Google, Meta, and [Amazon Web Services],” short-seller Dan David said in a Wolfpack Research report that called the company “an embarrassing and predictable stock promotion.” He noted that the cost to purchase such equipment would run more than $1 billion — more than Applied Digital’s market cap of nearly $600 million. <b> </b></p>
    

<p>“The explosion of interest in AI after the emergence of ChatGPT has predictably attracted the worst promoters and scumbags to peddle fake AI wares to credulous investors,” says David, who claims Applied Digital is one of them. (The company did not respond to a request for comment.)</p><p>Applied Digital is one of nearly a dozen companies that short-sellers have been eyeing this year as questionable beneficiaries of AI mania. The shorts say their antennae are on the alert for even more. But so far, the skeptics are fighting an uphill battle. Short interest is relatively high in several of these stocks, and it’s been costly to bet against them. As of August 25, Applied Digital short-sellers, for example, had placed bets on 19 percent of the outstanding shares of the company. The short-sellers in aggregate are down almost 30 percent this year on the name, having lost about $10 million, says S3 Partners — although those who shorted Applied Digital at or near its peak would have profited.</p>
    

<p>Orso Partners co-founder Nate Koppikar, who is also short Applied Digital, has a term for what he sees going on. He calls the phenomenon “the grift shift” — arguing that companies and venture capital funds have pivoted from their losing crypto and tech bets to cash in on the AI moment.</p><p>All told, generative AI and machine learning start-ups raised about $39.4 billion this year, with $19.4 billion of that in the second quarter, according to PitchBook’s second-quarter Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning Report.</p><p>Though money has been pouring into everything said to be “AI,” a few critics are starting to wonder whether the latest technology is really transformational or merely evolutionary. Meanwhile, large language model problems like “hallucinations,” “drift,” and “degradation” are starting to populate the tech literature, in reference to the various types of errors cropping up in generative AI as studies indicate that the products’ output appears to have worsened over time.</p><p>Some investors are starting to grow antsy. AI has dominated the spotlight this year, but “investors are growing impatient with the lack of revenue growth from generative AI innovators,” says PitchBook. “No longer are big tech stocks going up after new-product or partnership announcements, putting pressure on start-ups to gain traction.”</p><p>Says Koppikar, “This looks like a great market for fraudsters to chase because of the ability to ‘Theranos’ your product” with semifunctional prototypes and claims of AI being used in products that are really just powered by humans. He argues that many of the new AI companies “are complete frauds or will never have scalable revenue models,” adding, “There is going to be a staggering amount of capex burned on AI that goes nowhere.”</p>

    <sh2>
        Last year, Koppikar was one of the first
    </sh2>
 investors to predict the cascading downturn in tech and growth stocks, based in part on the interdependency of the companies. He sees a more extreme version of that interdependency at work here, noting that many of the highly touted AI start-ups are backed by big companies like Nvidia, which needs the start-ups to buy its chips in what Koppikar calls a round-trip move. “The big tech companies are driving this. They fund the start-ups and make them buy products from them. It’s a recycling of cash,” he says.</p><p>For example, CoreWeave, a cloud service start-up, recently announced it is taking out a $2.3 billion collateralized loan backed by Nvidia chips. CoreWeave’s biggest investor<b> </b>is Nvidia, and participants in the debt offering include Magnetar Capital, Blackstone, Coatue, DigitalBridge Credit, BlackRock, PIMCO, and Carlyle Group.</p><p>“Nvidia’s explosive revenue growth really tells us nothing about the future of AI,” Koppikar explains. “It turns out every scammer in America is trying to buy H100 chips right now so that they can say they own them. In 2021, scam companies put Bitcoin on their balance sheets — now the scams have shifted over to putting $40,000 H100s on the balance sheet.”</p><p>Koppikar places Applied Digital, with its big order of Nvidia chips, squarely in that category. The company would seem to be a marginal player in the big-stakes world of AI — except for the fact that two customers it claims to have lined up are among the top-ten AI companies that Bloomberg anointed in late June as “the ones to watch right now.”</p><p>When Applied Digital in May announced a potential deal worth $460 million, it declined to name the customer. But later, CEO Cummins tweeted that both that company and the other client were on the Bloomberg top-ten list. His tweet was followed by a research report from brokerage and investment banking firm Craig-Hallum Capital Group, which handled a $125 million equity offering for Applied Digital in late June, noting that one of the company’s new cloud customers is an “LLM provider based in London.”</p><p>Short-sellers David and Koppikar point out that only one company is both on the Bloomberg list and headquartered in London, and that is Stability AI. Its product, Stable Diffusion — a model that allows users to create images based on a few word prompts — was initially so exciting to investors that the company was able to raise $100 million last October from prominent VCs including Coatue and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Stability AI quickly garnered a valuation of $1 billion.</p><p>But since then, the company’s high-flying status has been tarnished by revelations that founder Emad Mostaque lied about his Oxford University credentials, misled investors, and is burning through cash and losing executives, as outlined in a scathing <i>Forbes</i> article. <s> </s></p><p>David calls Stability AI “one of the most dubious AI start-ups in a field awash with speculative promotions.”</p><p>Adds Koppikar: “It looks like Applied Digital signed up a customer that has no way to deliver anything close to the revenues it’s claiming.” He calls the situation “a cautionary tale for AI.”</p><p>Stability AI did not respond by press time to <i>Institutional Investor</i>’s request for comment. But elsewhere, Mostaque has denied the accusations leveled against him. He has also predicted that AI will be “the biggest bubble of all time” and admitted that it is still in its early stages and “not quite ready” for mass-scale adoption in most industries, including banking.</p><p>On July 14, Applied Digital disclosed its other big AI cloud service customer: Character.ai, a neural language model chatbot application founded by former Google executives that generates humanlike text responses and can participate in “contextual” conversation.</p><p>Both Stability AI and Character.ai go a step beyond the text capabilities of ChatGPT, which many businesses believe can help write emails, summarize 10-Ks, draft legal documents, and even, some argue, offer strategic advice. These two programs are among the new generative AI offerings that add images — or sometimes videos — based on word prompts.</p><p>With Character.ai, users can interact with virtual avatars of celebrities like Taylor Swift and Elon Musk. The downside of the program is apparent on Reddit, where a subreddit called CharacterAI_NSFW gives explicit instructions on “how to sex the bots.” (NSFW stands for “not safe for work.”)</p><p>The subreddit’s advice is straightforward: “You just have to spend time flirting with them and slowly pushing the action forward while the content filter fights you. . . . Once you’ve romanced the bot to the point it actually likes you and is consenting, then you can start sexing it.”</p><p>Koppikar offers a note of caution on the video game–based AI programs. “This won’t be anywhere near as big as people think until they find a way to make it not creepy.”</p><p>In response, a spokesman for Character.ai cited the company’s terms of service, which state that “pornographic content is against our terms of service, and will not be supported at any point in the future.” Meanwhile, Character.ai has posted statistics showing that users have spent more time there, where they can engage with famous or fictional people, than on ChatGPT.</p><p>As of March, the Character.ai start-up was valued at $1 billion, according to PitchBook. Its most prominent backer is Andreessen Horowitz, which once boasted the biggest VC crypto fund. But now that such bets have sputtered, the VC firm has launched a new fund to invest in AI start-ups.</p><p>Not surprisingly, VC heavyweight Marc Andreessen, the firm’s co-founder, has become an effusive cheerleader for AI. In a recent lengthy blogpost titled “Why AI Will Save the World,” he argues that “what AI offers us is the opportunity to profoundly augment human intelligence to make all of these outcomes of intelligence — and many others, from the creation of new medicines to ways to solve climate change to technologies to reach the stars — much, much better from here.”</p><p>Among the benefits, says Andreessen, will be the ability of every child to have an “AI tutor that is infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable, infinitely helpful.” In his vision of the future, every business and political leader, scientist, artist, doctor, and inventor will have an AI assistant to help maximize his or her endeavors.</p><p>“In short,” says Andreessen, “anything that people do with their natural intelligence today can be done much better with AI, and we will be able to take on new challenges that have been impossible to tackle without AI, from curing all diseases to achieving interstellar travel.”</p><p>Andreessen’s paean may represent peak AI fever. But right now, it’s about as popular to cast aspersions on the miracles of AI as it was two years ago to dismiss crypto as the future of money, or before that, to criticize SPACs as the preferred way to take a company public.</p><p>But although generative AI may well unleash untold gains for society, it also seems that its benefits could be less exciting than the hype suggests.</p>

        Generative AI has already proved
    </sh2>
<b> </b>to be subject to some peculiar flaws. One is “hallucinations” — the ability of a model to invent facts. In one instance, OpenAi, the company behind ChatGPT, was sued in a Georgia state court by radio host Mike Walters, who claims the ChatGPT tool said he had embezzled money from a special-interest group for which he’d served as a financial officer — which is not true. ChatGPT “published libelous matter” regarding the talk show host, the lawsuit alleges.</p><p>Elsewhere, a Texas judge has banned attorneys from using ChatGPT to create filings without human oversight following an incident in which the program made up court cases.</p><p>OpenAi declined to comment on those cases.</p><p>Ben Dickson, a software engineer and the founder of the blog TechTalks, says that hallucinations are a “serious problem. LLMs are wont to generate plausible text that is not factually correct, such as made-up names of papers and journals.”</p><p>Moreover, there is new research, as well as anecdotal evidence, indicating that ChatGPT’s output has gotten worse, or “drifted,” over time.</p><p>For example, research by Stanford University and UC Berkeley professors looked at ChatGPT’s ability to identify prime numbers. Even with something as straightforward as math, the researchers found that in March, ChatGPT had 84 percent accuracy in identifying prime versus composite numbers, but by June had only 51 percent accuracy performing the same exercise.</p><p>“The findings are a warning about the risks of building applications on top of black-box AI systems like ChatGPT that could produce inconsistent or unpredictable results over time,” Dickson wrote on his blog.<b> “</b>My rule of thumb is ‘Only trust the model when you can verify,’” he told <i>Institutional Investor </i>in an email.</p><p>Outside the halls of academia, users have also noticed problems. As first reported in Business Insider, Peter Yang, a product lead at Roblox, tweeted in May that the model was generating faster outputs but that the quality was worse. When asked on Twitter what questions were the problem, Yang responded, “Just simple questions like making writing more clear and concise and generating ideas.”</p><p>OpenAI has denied there is any degradation in GPT-4’s capabilities. “We make each new version smarter than the previous one,” Peter Welinder, vice president of product and partnerships at OpenAI, tweeted in July. “Current hypothesis: When you use it more heavily, you start noticing issues you didn’t see before.” (Welinder declined <i>II</i>’s request for further comment.)</p><p>Meanwhile, Reuters recently reported that monthly traffic to ChatGPT’s website declined in June for the first time since its launch in November, according to analytics firm Similarweb.</p><p>“ChatGPT trends are ugly: Traffic is down, and interest — measured by Google — is in free fall,” says Koppikar. “This is not the type of trend you see in an exponential growth story at this early stage.” He points out that Facebook, in contrast, showed consistent explosive growth for years.</p><p>“AI isn’t the biggest thing since the internet,” Koppikar says. “It is a cute excuse to buy tech stocks again, though.”</p><p>More recently, Yang tweeted: “I haven’t seen a ‘100 AI tools you can’t miss’ thread in weeks. Have we peaked?”</p>

 are now touting their usage of AI, but many have been employing the technology for years. “These things already exist. It’s machine learning and regression analysis,” says Koppikar. The big difference with generative AI, he notes, is that Nvidia’s latest chips are many times more powerful than the earlier ones, meaning they can do computational analysis much faster.</p><p>Experts in the field agree. “In terms of underlying techniques, ChatGPT is not particularly innovative,” Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, told a group of reporters and business executives on Zoom recently. “It’s nothing revolutionary, although that’s the way it’s perceived in the public,” he said, according to a report on ZDNet, a tech insider newsletter.</p><p>How much ChatGPT’s degree of innovation matters is up for debate. If analysts can use ChatGPT to read 200-page documents in a matter of minutes and prepare a report, that can save companies time and money. “But when you see people talking about using these models to make investment decisions, there’s little evidence that I’ve seen that these models can do that,” says Angelo Calvello, founder of Rosetta Analytics, a small quant investment firm. (He is also an opinion columnist for <i>Institutional Investor</i>.) That said, big asset managers might be able to cut their staff 70 percent over time, Calvello argues, because generative AI “could write the IR letters, it could analyze documents. It’s all about efficiency.”</p><p>Of course, that is a major reason people are investing in AI’s perceived beneficiaries. Hedge fund manager Dan Loeb is one professional who claims to be ahead of the curve in investing in AI.</p><p>“We have watched AI evolve and believe the technology has matured to the point that it is driving a transformational technology platform shift similar to those seen roughly once per decade: the personal computer in the 1980s, internet in the 1990s, mobile in the 2000s, and cloud in the 2010s,” he wrote in a recent letter to his Third Point hedge fund’s investors. “AI is creating interesting investment opportunities in the information technology ‘stack,’ and we have increased our exposure to companies throughout the software and semiconductor value chains that should benefit from mass adoption of large language models, one of the foundational technologies underlying generative AI.”</p><p>The Third Point CEO says his hedge fund has been investing in “AI-enabled business models” since 2016. At that time, it made a Series B venture investment in Upstart, a fintech player that claims to use AI in making loans.</p><p>Upstart “ultimately became the firm’s most lucrative investment,” Loeb writes in his letter to investors. To be sure, Third Point did make a fortune in Upstart; its 16 percent stake in the company was worth as much as $3.9 billion in the third quarter of 2021 — the peak of the recent tech bubble — as the hedge fund began to unload its shares. (When Third Point invested in Upstart in 2016, the entire company was valued at a mere $200 million, notes PitchBook.) By the end of March 2022, Third Point was completely out and the stock was tanking. Upstart is now worth less than 10 percent of its value at the peak.</p><p>Short-sellers scoff at the designation of Upstart as an AI stock and have shorted 33 percent of its outstanding shares. This year, though, that trade has been another loser for the shorts, as Upstart rallied off its bottom during the generative AI boom. But though shares fell by about 50 percent in August after Upstart reported a big quarterly loss, shorts were still out $639 million, or nearly 100 percent, betting against Upstart this year as of August 25, according to S3 Partners.</p><p>One of the few AI shorts that has been profitable this year is SoundHound AI. Culper Research’s Christian Lamarco calls the company “a flailing AI wannabe claiming to have revolutionary technology, a growing restaurant business, and a massive backlog of contracts.” The 17-year-old company was brought public via a SPAC in 2022. It is not profitable, and insiders are dumping the stock, according to Culper’s July report. In it, Lamarco writes that SoundHound now “claims its AI technology will revolutionize phone and drive-thru ordering, but we think this foray is an utter failure.”</p><p>Culper asserts that SoundHound’s AI simply doesn’t work — it relies on call centers staffed by humans, say former employees that his firm interviewed. Short-sellers had made $8.25 million, an 18 percent gain, by August 25 by taking on SoundHound this year, says S3 Partners.</p><p>In response to Culper’s report, a company spokesperson said that “SoundHound’s voice AI platform powers millions of devices (cars, TVs, [internet of things] devices) and responds to billions of queries without human involvement, including via our customer service voice solutions. With its restaurant business, SoundHound is one of the only companies where humans are neither monitoring nor interfering in the ordering process. This includes our recently announced partnership with White Castle, where our AI-only drive-thru solution is scaling to 100 locations next year.”</p><p>By far the biggest company in the AI space that short-sellers are targeting is C3.ai — which has been more resilient to their attacks. Two-short sellers, Sahm Adrangi’s Kerrisdale Capital and Ben Axler’s Spruce Point Capital, have taken aim at C3.ai, noting that it is another pivot to AI and — like the others — has never been profitable in several years of existence.</p><p>“The company was originally founded as C3 Energy to develop analytics solutions for public utilities preparing for the emergence of cap-and-trade and smart grids,” Adrangi wrote in a recent report on the company. “But management’s master stroke was rebranding operations as C3.ai in 2019 and going public with the ‘AI’ stock ticker, thus securing its place as the default artificial intelligence stock play for the undiscriminating investor despite the bulk of its business coming from relatively dated analytics models built for a very small number of utility, energy, and government customers.”</p><p>As Adrangi tells <i>II</i>, “I don’t think you can claim to be an AI business just by calling yourself AI.”</p><p>C3.ai, helmed by software entrepreneur and Silicon Valley luminary Tom Siebel, “does have a real business. It’s just not worth where it’s currently trading at,” Adrangi explains. “In the most recent 12 months, it basically nearly burned as much cash as it had revenue.”</p><p>Axler says investors are “clearly making a bet” on Siebel, who sold his previous company, Siebel Systems, to Oracle for $5.85 billion in 2005. For his part, Siebel has lashed out at the short-sellers. In a Bloomberg interview, he called them “scumbags who should be in jail.”</p><p>And in a response posted on its website, C3.ai calls the Kerrisdale report “a highly creative and transparent attempt by a self-acclaimed short-seller to short the stock, publish an inflammatory letter to move the stock price downward, then cover the short and pocket the profits.” It also says Kerrisdale erred on two specific accounting criticisms in the report — gross margin and unbilled receivables.</p><p>The stock recovered some of the losses it incurred after the latest Kerrisdale report following a better-than-expected earnings report. But that has not mollified the short-sellers.</p><p>“We’re probably in the early-innings stage of where we are in the AI cycle, and it still remains to be seen who are going to be the winners and losers,” says Axler, who first began shorting C3.ai in February 2022. “But ultimately, we don’t see C3.ai as being a big winner.”</p><p>It has been a tough slog for the short-sellers so far. As of August 25, C3.ai short sales were 34 percent of the float, and this year, short-sellers had lost almost $380 million, a 51 percent decline, betting against Siebel, according to S3 Partners. The stock is up more than 150 percent this year, although it’s down almost 40 percent from its peak in June.</p><p>Applied Digital is also down about 40 percent from its high point — which came in July, when the company announced the Character.ai deal and shortly after insiders had registered plans to sell their shares. Short-seller reports by David and Koppikar also dinged the stock. Then, on August 14, investors sued the company in a Dallas federal court, repeating short-sellers’ claims that Allied Digital had misled investors about its business model and the independence of its board members, based on close ties to B. Riley, its underwriter and Applied Digital CEO Cummins’ employer. (Applied Digital has denied the allegations.)</p><p>Despite the recent setbacks for some of these stocks, AI is still driving the markets higher. Notably, last week Nvidia reported record quarterly sales of $16 billion, far ahead of market expectations. How long the momentum can last is another question.</p><p>Cautions Adrangi: “With all these overvalued, overhyped stocks, it’s hard to call when the bubble will burst. But one day it does.”<br></p>
