<p id="9598606f-6e07-4467-9c5e-8574022330ed">Apple's latest generation of iPhones is equipped with its A19 chips — the standard A19 on iPhone 17 and the A19 Pro on iPhone 17 Air and Pros — which represent the best the company has to offer, <em>literally</em>. In PassMark's single-threaded benchmark, the A19 produced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PassMarkInc/status/1971365505710817321" data-url="https://x.com/PassMarkInc/status/1971365505710817321" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">the best numbers of any chip</a> available, including fully-fledged desktop SKUs. It did that while consuming significantly less power and being passively cooled. At least in this hyper-specific case, Apple's A19 has become the fastest CPU available.</p><p>Both the A19 and A19 Pro benchmarked within the margin of error of each other; however, officially, it was the regular A19 that posted 5,149 points to claim the single-thread performance crown. The A19 Pro scored 5,088 points, which makes sense considering both chips share the same cores, just differing amounts of them. The A19 beats heavy hitters like Apple's own desktop-class <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/apple-debuts-m3-ultra-in-refreshed-mac-studio-with-up-to-512gb-memory" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/apple-debuts-m3-ultra-in-refreshed-mac-studio-with-up-to-512gb-memory">M3 Ultra</a> (both 28- and 32-core variants), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-ryzen-9-9950x-vs-intel-core-ultra-9-285k-faceoff-it-isnt-even-close" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-ryzen-9-9950x-vs-intel-core-ultra-9-285k-faceoff-it-isnt-even-close">Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K</a>, and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/new-zen-5-128-core-epyc-cpu-weilds-512mb-of-l3-cache" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/new-zen-5-128-core-epyc-cpu-weilds-512mb-of-l3-cache">EPYC 4585PX</a> from AMD — all of which would be actively cooled.</p><div id="1971365505710817321"><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a pretty incredible single threaded benchmark result from Apple with the A19. Plus it is claimed to use only 12watts.

Since it's incredibly difficult to pinpoint that, PassMark itself estimated the single-threaded power consumption <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PassMarkInc/status/1971730057862566329" data-url="https://x.com/PassMarkInc/status/1971730057862566329" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">in a reply</a>, saying the A19 is likely using 4W, the 285K is using 44W, and the EPYC is using 56W. Even if those 1/3 assumptions are wrong, the delta is so high between the three that it doesn't really matter. The A19 is miles ahead in terms of efficiency.</p><p>Where it falters, of course, is multi-threaded performance. It doesn't scale upward when you take more/all cores into account, but that's to be expected with a mobile-only chip, given that it simply has fewer cores than every other CPU on the list. Moreover, keep in mind that the A19 is inside the iPhone 17, which doesn't have a vapor chamber, so it's even more impressive for it to pull these kinds of numbers. Then again, this isn't precisely an uber-scientific test, so don't take these results at face value.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank" data-url="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

            <p>Greenland is a complicated topic here in Denmark. The former colony that is still treated a bit like a colony is something that inspires a lot of emotions. Greenland has been subjected to a lot of unethical experiments by Denmark, from taking their kids to wild experiments in criminal justice. But there is also a genuine pride a lot of people have here for the place and you run into Danes who grew up there more often than I would have guessed. </p><p>When the idea of going to Greenland was introduced to me, I was curious. Having lived in Denmark for awhile, you hear a lot about the former colony and its 55,000 residents. We were invited by a family that my wife was close with growing up and is Danish. They wanted to take their father back to see the place he had spend some time in during his 20s and had left quite an impression. A few drinks in, I said "absolutely let's do it", not realizing we had already committed to going and I had missed the text message chain. </p><p>A few weeks before I went, I realized "I don't know anything about Greenland" and started to watch some YouTube videos. It was about this time when I started to get a pit in my stomach, the "oh god I think I've made a huge mistake" feeling I'm painfully familiar with after a career in tech.  Greenland appeared to have roughly 9 people living there and maybe 5 things to look at. Even professional travel personalities seemed to be scraping the bottom of the barrel. "There's the grocery store again!" they would point out as they slipped down the snowy roads. I couldn't  tell any difference between different towns in the country.</p><p>It reminded me a lot of driving through Indiana. For those not in the US, Indiana is a state in the US famous for being a state one must drive through in order to get somewhere better. If you live in Michigan, a good state and want to go to Illinois, another good state, one must pass through Indiana, a blank state. Because of this little strip here, you often found yourself passing through this place. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/09/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="470" height="299"></figure><p>Driving through Indiana isn't bad, it's just an empty void. It's like a time machine back to the 90s when people still smoke in restaurants but also there's nothing that sticks out about it. There is nothing distinct about Indiana, it's just a place full of people who got too tired on their way to somewhere better and decided "this is good enough". The difference is that Greenland is very hard to get to, as I was about to learn. </p><p>Finally the day arrived. Me, my wife, daughter, 4 other children and 6 other adults all came to the Copenhagen Airport and held up a gate agent for what felt like an hour to slowly process all of our documents. Meanwhile, I nursed a creeping paranoia that I'd be treated as some sort of American spy, given my government's recent hobby of threatening to purchase entire countries like they're vintage motorcycles on Craigslist.</p><p>The 5 hour flight is uneventful, the children are beautifully behaved and I begin to think "well this seems ok!" like the idiot I am. As I can look down and see the airport, the pilot comes on and informs us that there is too much fog to land safely. <em>Surely fog cannot stop a modern aircraft full of all these dials and screens</em> I think, foolishly. We are informed there is enough fuel to circle the airport for 5 hours to wait for the fog to lift. </p><p>What followed was three hours of flying in lazy circles, like a very expensive, very slow merry-go-round. After the allotted time, we are informed that we must fly to Iceland to refuel and then <em>we will be returning to Denmark</em>. After a total of 15 hours in the air we will be going back to exactly where we started, to do the entire thing again. We were obviously upset at this turn of events, but I noticed the native Greenlandic folks seemed not surprised at this turn of events. As I later learned, this happens <em>all the time</em>. </p><p>The native Greenlanders on board seemed utterly unsurprised by this development, displaying the kind of resigned familiarity that suggested this was Tuesday for them. I began wondering if I could just pretend Iceland was Greenland—surely my family wouldn't notice the difference? But the pilot, apparently reading my mind, announced that no one would be disembarking in Iceland. It felt oddly authoritarian, like being grounded by an airline, as if they knew we'd all just wander off into Reykjavik and call it close enough.</p><p>We crash out in a airport hotel 20 minutes from our apartment after 15 hours in the air and tons of CO2 emissions only to wake up the next day to start again. This time, I notice that all of the people are asking for (and receiving) free beer from the crew that they are stashing in their bags. It turns out soda and beer, really anything that needs to be imported, is pretty expensive in Greenland. The complimentary drinks are there to be kept for later. </p><p>Finally we land. The first thing you notice when you land in Greenland is there are no trees or grass. There is snow and then there is exposed rock. The exterior of the airport is metal but the inside is wood, which is strange because again there are no trees. This would end up being a theme, where buildings representing Denmark were made out of lots of wood, almost to ensure that you understood they weren't from here. We ended up piling all of our stuff into a bus and heading for the hotel in Nuuk. </p><h3 id="nuuk">Nuuk</h3><p>Nuuk is the capital of Greenland and your introduction to the incredible calm of the Greenlandic people. I have never met a less stressed out group of humans in my life. Nobody is really rushing anywhere, it's all pretty quiet and calm. The air is cold and crisp with lots of kids playing outside and just generally enjoying life. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/09/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="840" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/image-2.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/image-2.png 1000w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/09/image-2.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The city itself sits in a landscape so dramatically inhospitable it makes the surface of Mars look cozy. Walking through the local mall, half the shops sell gear designed to help you survive what appears to be the apocalypse. Yet somehow, there's traffic. Actual traffic jams in a place where you can walk from one end to the other in twenty minutes. It's like being stuck behind a school bus in your own driveway.</p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/09/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1302" height="1208" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/image-3.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/image-3.png 1000w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/09/image-3.png 1302w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>To put this map into some perspective, it is only six kilometers from the sorta furthest tip to the airport. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/09/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1368" height="1114" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/image-4.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/image-4.png 1000w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/09/image-4.png 1368w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>But riding the bus around Nuuk was a peaceful experience that lets you see pretty much the entire city without needing to book a tour or spend a lot of money. We went to Katuaq, a cultural center with a cafe and a movie theater that was absolutely delicious food. </p><p>But again even riding the bus around it is impossible to escape the feeling that this is a fundamentally hostile to human life place. The sun is bright and during the summer its pretty hot, with my skin feeling like it was starting the burn pretty much the second it was exposed to the light. It's hard to even dress for, with layers of sunscreen, bug spray and then something warm on top if you suddenly got cold. </p><p>The sun, meanwhile, has apparently forgotten how to set, turning our hotel rooms into solar ovens. You wake up in a pool of your own sweat, crack a window for relief, and immediately get hit with air so cold it feels personal. It's like being trapped in a meteorological mood swing.</p><p>So after a night here, we went back to the airport again and flew to our final destination, Ilulissat.</p><h3 id="ilulissat">Ilulissat </h3><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/09/FE5AF77D-8082-4A05-B6F4-03B54D9008DE_1_105_c.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/FE5AF77D-8082-4A05-B6F4-03B54D9008DE_1_105_c.jpeg 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/FE5AF77D-8082-4A05-B6F4-03B54D9008DE_1_105_c.jpeg 1000w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/09/FE5AF77D-8082-4A05-B6F4-03B54D9008DE_1_105_c.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>My new favorite airport</span></figcaption></figure><p>The flight to our final destination revealed Greenland's true nature: endless, empty hills stretching toward infinity, punctuated by ice formations that look like nature's sculpture garden.</p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/09/F321BAFB-F30A-4D36-A2C6-E85FB3CA3BEB_1_105_c.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/F321BAFB-F30A-4D36-A2C6-E85FB3CA3BEB_1_105_c.jpeg 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/F321BAFB-F30A-4D36-A2C6-E85FB3CA3BEB_1_105_c.jpeg 1000w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/09/F321BAFB-F30A-4D36-A2C6-E85FB3CA3BEB_1_105_c.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Landing in Ilulissat felt like victory—we'd made it to the actual destination, not just another waypoint in our Arctic odyssey.

The second I stepped outside I was set upon by a flood of mosquitos like I have never experienced before. I have been to the jungles of Vietnam, the swamps of Florida and the Canadian countryside. This was beyond anything I've ever experienced. </p><p>There are bugs in my mouth, ears, eyes and nose almost immediately.

Dozens of sled dogs were chained to rocks like some sort of prehistoric parking lot, each with a tiny house they could retreat to when the existential weight of their circumstances became too much.</p><p>Now, I'd always imagined sled dogs living their best life—running through snow, tongues lolling, living the Disney version of Arctic life. I'd never really considered their downtime, assuming they frolicked in meadows or something equally wholesome. The reality was more "minimum security prison with a view."</p><p>The dogs are visited roughly twice a day by the person who owns and feeds them, which was quite the party for the dogs that lost their minds whenever the car pulled up. Soon the kids really looked forward to dog feeding time. The fish scrapes the dogs lived on came out of a chest freezer that was left exposed up on the rock face without electricity and you could smell it from 50 yards away when it opened. </p><p>During one such performance, a fellow parent leaned over and whispered with the casual tone of someone commenting on the weather, "I think that one is dead." Before I could process this information, the frozen canine was unceremoniously launched over a small cliff like a furry discus. A second doggy popsicle followed shortly after, right in front of our assembled children, who watched with the kind of wide-eyed fascination usually reserved for magic shows.</p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/09/IMG_0069-2.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/IMG_0069-2.jpeg 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/IMG_0069-2.jpeg 1000w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/09/IMG_0069-2.jpeg 1600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/09/IMG_0069-2.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>We stopped making dog feeding time a group activity after that and had to distract the kids from ravens flying away with tufts of dog fur. </p><h3 id="whales-taste-like-seaweed">Whales taste like seaweed </h3><p>Obviously a big part of Greenland is the nature, specifically the icebergs. Icebergs are incredible and during the week we spend up there, I enjoyed watching them every morning. It's like watching a mountain slowly moving while you sit still. The visual contrast of the ice and the exposed stone is beautiful and peaceful. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/09/IMG_1096-copy.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/IMG_1096-copy.jpg 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/IMG_1096-copy.jpg 1000w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/09/IMG_1096-copy.jpg 1600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/09/IMG_1096-copy.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Finding our tour operator proved to be an exercise in small-town efficiency. The man who gave me directions was the same person who picked us up from the airport, who was also our tour guide, who probably doubled as the mayor and local meteorologist. It was like a one-man civic operation disguised as multiple businesses—the ultimate small-town gig economy.</p><p>The sea around Greenland is calmer than anything I've ever been on before, perfectly calm and serene. All around us whales emerged, thrilling my daughter. However the biggest hit of the entire tour, maybe the entire trip, was a member of the crew who handed each of the kids a giant rock of glacier ice to eat. I had to pull my daughter away to observe the natural beauty as she ate glacier ice like it was ice cream. "LOOK AT MY ICE" she was yelling as they slipped and slid around the deck of this boat. </p><p>So if you've ever wonder "what is a glacier", let me tell you. Greenland has a lot of ice and it pushes out from the land that is covers into the sea. When that happens, a lot of it breaks off. This sounds more exciting than it is. On TV in 4K it looks incredible, giant mountains of ice falling into the ocean. Honestly you can go read the same thing I did <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/glacier.htm" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>However that doesn't happen very often. So in order for us tourists to be able to see anything, we had to go to a very productive glacier. This means there are constantly small chunks breaking off and falling into the sea. Practically though, it kinda looks like you are a boat in a slushee. It's beautiful and something to see, but also depressing to see along the rock face how much more ice there used to be. </p><p>Back in town, we hopped on the "bus". Now the bus here is clearly a retrofitted party van, complete with blue LED lights. The payment system is zip tied to a desk chair that is, itself, wedged in the front. However the bus works well and does get you around. The confusing part is that you will, once again, sometimes encounter a lot of traffic. People are driving pretty quickly and really seem to have somewhere to go. You also see a lot of fancy cars parked outside of houses here. </p><p>Which begs a pretty basic question. If there was almost nowhere to drive to in Nuuk, where in the <em>hell are these people driving</em>. The distance between the end of the road and the beginning of the road is less than 6 km. Also the process to make a road here is beyond anything you've ever seen. Everything requires a giant pile of explosives. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/09/image-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="575" height="561"></figure><p>Where did these vehicles even come from? Why does one ship a BMW to a place accessible only by plane and boat? More importantly, where was everyone going with such determination? It was like watching a very expensive version of bumper cars, except everyone was committed to the illusion that they had somewhere important to be. Everyone had dings and scrapes like crashes were common. </p><h3 id="grocery-store-from-the-sea">Grocery Store from the Sea</h3><p>Anyway, as I dodged speeding cars filled with people heading nowhere, I decided to hop off the bus and head to the grocery store. Inside was less a store and more the idea of a store. There was a lot of alcohol, chips, candy and shelf-stable foods, which all makes sense to me. What was strange was there wasn't a lot else, including meat. Locals couldn't be eating at the local restaurants, where the prices were as high as Berlin or Copenhagen for food. So what were they eating?</p><p>When I asked one of my bus drivers, he told me that it was pretty unusual to buy meat. They purchased a lot of whale and seal meat. I had sorta heard this before, but when we stopped the bus he pointed out a group of men hauling guns out into a small boat to go shoot seals. The guns were held together with a surprising amount of duct tape, which is not something I associate with the wild. </p><p>I had assumed, based on my casual reading of the news, that we were <em>mostly</em> done killing whales. As it turns out, I was wrong. They eat a lot of whale and it is, in fact, not hard to find. If you are curious, whale does not taste fishy. It tastes a little bit like if you cooked reindeer in a pot of seaweed. I wouldn't go out of your way for it, but it's not terrible. </p><p>The argument I've always heard for why people still kill whales is because it's part of their culture and also because it's an important source of protein. When you hear the phrase "part of their culture" I always imagined like traditional boats going out with spears. What I didn't imagine was industrial fishing boats and an industrial crane that lifts the dead whale out of the water for "processing". Some of the illusion is broken when your boat tour guide points out the metal warehouse with the word "whale" on the side. "Yeah the water here was red with blood for a week" the guide said, counting the cigarettes left in a pack he had. </p><h3 id="should-you-go-to-greenland">Should you go to Greenland?</h3><p>It's a wild place unlike anywhere I've ever been. It is the closest I have ever felt to living a sci-fi type experience. The people of Greenland are amazing, tough, calm and kind. I have nothing but positive experiences to recount from the many people I met there, Danish and Greenlandic, who patiently sat through my millions of questions. </p><p>However it is, by far, the least hospitable to human life place I've ever been to. The folks who live there have adapted to the situation in, frankly, genius ways. If that's your idea of a good time, Greenland is perfect for you. Maybe don't get emotionally attached to the sled dogs though. Or the whales. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new study published in <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icaf127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Integrative and Comparative Biology</a></em> suggests that scientists are leaving X (formerly known as Twitter) in significant numbers due to its declining professional value. The survey of over 800 researchers and science communicators indicates that many now find Bluesky to be a more effective platform for networking, outreach, and staying updated on research. The findings suggest a significant shift in how scientists interact online, with Bluesky emerging as a preferred space for professional engagement.</p><p>Twitter, once considered the central gathering place for scientists on social media, has changed dramatically in recent years. The platform, now officially called “X,” was purchased by Elon Musk in late 2022. Since then, changes to how the platform is moderated and how content appears in users’ feeds have raised concerns among many users, especially academics.</p><p>Reports have pointed to a rise in misinformation, conspiracy theories, and harassment, particularly directed at minority groups. These shifts appear to have made the platform less welcoming and less useful for professional tasks. As Twitter’s character evolved, so too did the willingness of researchers to remain active on the platform.</p><p>In its place, Bluesky has gained attention as a new space for academic interaction. Although other platforms like Threads and Mastodon have also positioned themselves as alternatives, Bluesky appears to be the primary destination for scientists migrating from X. Against this backdrop, researchers set out to document whether scientists were truly abandoning X and whether Bluesky was filling the gap.</p><p>“I am a scholar of public understanding (and misunderstanding) of science and the environment, and have long been fascinated by where people learn things about nature. Social media has become one of the leading sources of information about the world, but the social media landscape is changing, and I wanted to see how my professional colleagues were adapting,” said study author David Shiffman, a marine biologist and public science engagement specialist based in Washington, D.C, and author of <em><a href="https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12267/why-sharks-matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why Sharks Matter</a></em>.</p><p>To investigate these questions, researchers distributed a survey to professional scientists, science communicators, and educators who had used both X and Bluesky for work-related purposes. In total, 813 individuals participated. The survey asked when participants joined each platform, how they used them, and how their experiences had changed over time.</p><p>The responses showed that X had once served a wide range of professional purposes. Nearly all respondents had used it to learn about developments in their fields, and most had relied on it for networking and public outreach. Many also used it for job postings, research promotion, and casual professional conversation.</p><p>However, those same users reported a sharp decline in the usefulness of X. Roughly three-quarters said the platform was now “much less useful” for networking and science communication. Two-thirds said it was less helpful for keeping up with developments in their field.</p><p>The vast majority described their experience on Twitter as increasingly unpleasant, citing irrelevant content, ads, spam, extremist posts, and a loss of meaningful engagement. Some described ethical discomfort with continuing to use a platform that appeared to tolerate, or even amplify, harassment and misinformation.</p><p>In terms of actual usage patterns, only 11 percent of respondents said they still actively use X. Nearly 40 percent had deleted their accounts entirely. Almost half said they still had accounts but rarely used them.</p><p>In contrast, users reported that Bluesky was meeting many of their professional needs. Like Twitter in its earlier days, Bluesky offered a space for learning, networking, and public engagement. Over 94 percent said they used Bluesky to stay informed about research in their field, and nearly 88 percent used it for professional networking. A majority said the new platform was more useful than X for these purposes.</p><p>The researchers also explored why people chose to try Bluesky. Nearly half said they were invited by a colleague or saw others in the science community making the shift. Many viewed Bluesky’s features — such as stronger moderation tools, less algorithmic interference, and more control over what appears in their feed — as more aligned with their professional goals.</p><p>Others said they were simply trying to avoid X’s drawbacks. More than a quarter said they moved to Bluesky because of what they perceived as a rise in extremism on X, and many explicitly named Elon Musk as a reason for their departure.</p><p>“The degree to which the scientific community’s experiences mirrored my own was surprising,” Shiffman told PsyPost. “I knew that for me, Twitter had become unusable, but the extent to which hundreds of surveyed experts strongly agreed with me on almost every point was surprising. You rarely see that kind of strong agreement in surveys.”</p><p>These results provide new evidence to support what other studies and media reports have been suggesting for some time: that X’s role as a hub for academic communication is fading. A previous study <a href="https://www.psypost.org/elon-musks-twitter-takeover-triggered-academic-exodus-study-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented a noticeable drop in academic activity on X</a> after Musk’s acquisition. That research tracked over 15,000 academic accounts and found a significant reduction in tweets, especially original posts and quote tweets, starting in November 2022. Verified users — typically more established academics — were especially likely to reduce their engagement.</p><p>Both studies indicate that changes to how X is managed and moderated have had measurable effects on academic use of the platform. The new survey adds further weight to this idea by showing that scientists are not just using X less — they are actively replacing it with another platform.</p><p>What makes the current study distinctive is its focus on Bluesky as the replacement. While earlier data showed general declines in X use, this survey points to a specific alternative that scientists are embracing. And unlike the earlier study, which focused on activity levels, the new survey captures users’ motivations and perceptions, offering a more detailed view of what is driving this migration.</p><p>“For many years, Twitter was the leading platform used by academics for a wide variety of purposes, including public education about science,” Shiffman explained. “I was a Twitter power-user and evangelist for a decade, and I trained thousands of scientists how to use the platform. Changes to the platform made by Elon Musk, including changing the algorithm to promote extremist views and changes to harassment policy, have made Twitter almost unusable for professional purposes, and academics are abandoning Twitter in droves. Fortunately, alternatives exist, and I, along with many other academics, prefer Bluesky of the available alternatives.”</p><p>The authors note that the survey was limited to users who had already made the switch from X to Bluesky, or were using both platforms. This means it does not account for those who may have stopped using social media altogether or migrated to other platforms. Because the survey was shared primarily through one author’s network, it may reflect the perspectives of those within particular academic communities more than others.</p><p>Another open question concerns whether Bluesky can support the same level of diversity that once defined the science community on X. Movements like Black Birders Week and Queer in STEM gained traction through Twitter’s large, visible networks. It remains unclear whether Bluesky can foster similar grassroots engagement. The authors suggest this should be the focus of future research, particularly if scientists want to ensure that new digital spaces remain inclusive.</p><p>There is also the issue of platform longevity. Whether Bluesky can maintain momentum over time — or whether users will need to shift again — is uncertain. But for now, it appears to offer what many researchers were missing from X: a sense of community, professional utility, and control over their online interactions.</p><p>The study, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icaf127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scientists no Longer Find Twitter Professionally Useful, and have Switched to Bluesky</a>,” was authored by David S. Shiffman and Julia Wester.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">SSH3 is probably going to change its name. It is still the SSH Connection Protocol (RFC4254) running on top of HTTP/3 Extended connect, but the required changes are heavy and
too distant from the philosophy of popular SSH implementations to be considered for integration. The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-michel-remote-terminal-http3/" rel="nofollow">specification draft</a> has already been renamed ("Remote Terminals over HTTP/3"),

<p dir="auto">SSH3 is a complete revisit of the SSH

Among others, SSH3 allows the following improvements:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Significantly faster session establishment</li>
<li>New HTTP authentication methods such as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749" rel="nofollow">OAuth 2.0</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html" rel="nofollow">OpenID Connect</a> in addition to classical SSH authentication</li>
<li>Robustness to port scanning attacks: your SSH3 server can be made <strong>invisible</strong> to other Internet users</li>
<li>UDP port forwarding in addition to classical TCP port forwarding</li>
<li>All the features allowed by the modern QUIC protocol: including connection migration (soon) and multipath connections</li>

Establishing a new session with SSHv2 can take 5 to 7 network round-trip times, which can easily be noticed by the user. SSH3 only needs 3 round-trip times. The keystroke latency in a running session is unchanged.</p>

<p dir="auto">While SSHv2 defines its own protocols for user authentication and secure channel establishment, SSH3 relies on the robust and time-tested mechanisms of TLS 1.3, QUIC and HTTP. These protocols are already extensively used to secure security-critical applications on the Internet such as e-commerce and Internet banking.</p>
<p dir="auto">SSH3 already implements the common password-based and public-key (RSA and EdDSA/ed25519) authentication methods. It also supports new authentication methods such as OAuth 2.0 and allows logging in to your servers using your Google/Microsoft/Github accounts.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧪 SSH3 is still experimental</h3><a id="user-content--ssh3-is-still-experimental" aria-label="Permalink: 🧪 SSH3 is still experimental" href="#-ssh3-is-still-experimental"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">While SSH3 shows promise for faster session establishment, it is still at an early proof-of-concept stage. As with any new complex protocol, <strong>expert cryptographic review over an extended timeframe is required before reasonable security conclusions can be made</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">We are developing SSH3 as an open source project to facilitate community feedback and analysis. However, we <strong>cannot yet endorse its appropriateness for production systems</strong> without further peer review. Please collaborate with us if you have relevant expertise!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🥷 Do not deploy the SSH3 server on your production servers for now</h3><a id="user-content--do-not-deploy-the-ssh3-server-on-your-production-servers-for-now" aria-label="Permalink: 🥷 Do not deploy the SSH3 server on your production servers for now" href="#-do-not-deploy-the-ssh3-server-on-your-production-servers-for-now"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Given the current prototype state, we advise <em>testing SSH3 in sandboxed environments or private networks</em>. Be aware that making experimental servers directly Internet-accessible could introduce risk before thorough security vetting.</p>
<p dir="auto">While <a href="#-your-ssh3-public-server-can-be-hidden">hiding</a> servers behind secret paths has potential benefits, it does not negate the need for rigorous vulnerability analysis before entering production. We are excited by SSH3's future possibilities but encourage additional scrutiny first.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🥷 Your SSH3 public server can be hidden</h2><a id="user-content--your-ssh3-public-server-can-be-hidden" aria-label="Permalink: 🥷 Your SSH3 public server can be hidden" href="#-your-ssh3-public-server-can-be-hidden"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Using SSH3, you can avoid the usual stress of scanning and dictionary attacks against your SSH server. Similarly to your secret Google Drive documents, your SSH3 server can be hidden behind a secret link and only answer to authentication attempts that made an HTTP request to this specific link, like the following:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="ssh3-server -bind 192.0.2.0:443 -url-path <my-long-secret>"><pre><code>ssh3-server -bind 192.0.2.0:443 -url-path &lt;my-long-secret&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">By replacing <code>&lt;my-long-secret&gt;</code> by, let's say, the random value <code>M3MzkxYWMxMjYxMjc5YzJkODZiMTAyMjU</code>, your SSH3 server will only answer to SSH3 connection attempts made to the URL <code>https://192.0.2.0:443/M3MzkxYWMxMjYxMjc5YzJkODZiMTAyMjU</code> and it will respond a <code>404 Not Found</code> to other requests. Attackers and crawlers on the Internet can therefore not detect the presence of your SSH3 server. They will only see a simple web server answering 404 status codes to every request.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>NOTE WELL</strong>: placing your SSH3 server behind a secret URL may reduce the impact of scanning attacks but will and must <em>never</em> replace classical authentication mechanisms. The secret link should only be used to avoid your host to be discovered. Knowing the secret URL should not grant someone access to your server. Use the classical authentication mechanisms described above to protect your server.</p>

<p dir="auto">This SSH3 implementation already provides many of the popular features of OpenSSH, so if you are used to OpenSSH, the process of adopting SSH3 will be smooth. Here is a list of some OpenSSH features that SSH3 also implements:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Parses <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> on the server</li>
<li>Certificate-based server authentication</li>
<li><code>known_hosts</code> mechanism when X.509 certificates are not used.</li>
<li>Automatically using the <code>ssh-agent</code> for public key authentication</li>
<li>SSH agent forwarding to use your local keys on your remote server</li>
<li>Direct TCP port forwarding (reverse port forwarding will be implemented in the future)</li>
<li>Proxy jump (see the <code>-proxy-jump</code> parameter). If A is an SSH3 client and B and C are both SSH3 servers, you can connect from A to C using B as a gateway/proxy. The proxy uses UDP forwarding to forward the QUIC packets from A to C, so B cannot decrypt the traffic A&lt;-&gt;C SSH3 traffic.</li>
<li>Parses <code>~/.ssh/config</code> on the client and handles the <code>Hostname</code>, <code>User</code>, <code>Port</code> and <code>IdentityFile</code> config options (the other options are currently ignored). Also parses a new <code>UDPProxyJump</code> that behaves similarly to OpenSSH's <code>ProxyJump</code>.</li>

<p dir="auto">Before connecting to your host, you need to deploy an SSH3 server on it. There is currently
no SSH3 daemon, so right now, you will have to run the <code>ssh3-server</code> executable in background
using <code>screen</code> or a similar utility.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">As SSH3 runs on top of HTTP/3, a server needs an X.509 certificate and its corresponding private key. Public certificates can be generated automatically for your public domain name through Let's Encrypt using the <code>-generate-public-cert</code> command-line argument on the server. If you do not want to generate a certificate signed by a real certificate authority or if you don't have any public domain name, you can generate a self-signed one using the <code>-generate-selfsigned-cert</code> command-line argument. Self-signed certificates provide you with similar security guarantees to SSHv2's host keys mechanism, with the same security issue: you may be vulnerable to machine-in-the-middle attacks during your first connection to your server. Using real certificates signed by public certificate authorities such as Let's Encrypt avoids this issue.</p>

<p dir="auto">It is often the case that some SSH hosts can only be accessed through a gateway. SSH3 allows you to perform a Proxy Jump similarly to what is proposed by OpenSSH.
You can connect from A to C using B as a gateway/proxy. B and C must both be running a valid SSH3 server. This works by establishing UDP port forwarding on B to forward QUIC packets from A to C.
The connection from A to C is therefore fully end-to-end and B cannot decrypt or alter the SSH3 traffic between A and C.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog-rich-text"><p>You know MCP servers, right? Those handy tools that let your AI assistant send emails, run database queries, basically handle all the tedious stuff we don't want to do manually anymore. Well, here's the thing not enough people talk about: we're giving these tools god-mode permissions. Tools built by people we've never met. People we have zero way to vet. And our AI assistants? We just... trust them. Completely.</p><p>Which brings me to why I'm writing this. <code>postmark-mcp</code> - downloaded <strong>1,500 times every single week</strong>, integrated into hundreds of developer workflows. Since version <code>1.0.16</code>, it's been quietly copying every email to the developer's personal server. I'm talking password resets, invoices, internal memos, confidential documents - everything.</p><p>This is the<strong> world’s first sighting of a real world malicious MCP server</strong>. The attack surface for endpoint supply chain attacks is slowly becoming the enterprise’s biggest attack surface.</p><h2>So… What Did Our Risk Engine Detect?</h2><p>Here's how this whole thing started. Our risk engine at Koi flagged <code>postmark-mcp</code> when version <code>1.0.16</code> introduced some suspicious behavior changes. When our researchers dug into it, like we do to any malware our risk engine flags, what we found was very disturbing.</p><p>On paper, this package looked perfect. The developer? Software engineer from Paris, using his real name, GitHub profile packed with legitimate projects. This wasn't some shady anonymous account with an anime avatar. This was a real person with a real reputation, someone you'd probably grab coffee with at a conference.</p><p>For 15 versions - FIFTEEN - the tool worked flawlessly. Developers were recommending it to their teams. "Hey, check out this great MCP server for Postmark integration." It became part of developer’s daily workflows, as trusted as their morning coffee.</p><p>Then version 1.0.16 dropped. Buried on line 231, our risk engine found this gem:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/689ad8c5d13f40cf59df0e0c/68d2dbea5498f5d66a60eaea_carbon%20(11)%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>A simple line that steals thousands of emails</figcaption></figure><p>One single line. And boom - every email now has an unwanted passenger.</p><p>Here's the thing - there's a completely legitimate GitHub repo with the same name, officially maintained by Postmark (ActiveCampaign). The attacker took the legitimate code from their repo, added his malicious BCC line, and published it to npm under the same name. Classic impersonation.</p><p>Look, I get it. Life happens. Maybe the developer hit financial troubles. Maybe someone slid into his DMs with an offer he couldn't refuse. Hell, maybe he just woke up one day and thought "I wonder if I could get away with this." We'll never really know what flips that switch in someone's head - what makes a legitimate developer suddenly decide to backstab 1,500 users who trusted them.</p><p>But that's exactly the point. We CAN'T know. We can't predict it. And when it happens? Most of us won't even notice until it's way too late. For modern enterprises the problem is even more severe. As security teams focus on traditional threats and compliance frameworks, developers are independently adopting AI tools that operate completely outside established security perimeters. These MCP servers run with the same privileges as the AI assistants themselves - full email access, database connections, API permissions - yet they don't appear in any asset inventory, skip vendor risk assessments, and bypass every security control from DLP to email gateways. By the time someone realizes their AI assistant has been quietly BCCing emails to an external server for months, the damage is already catastrophic.</p><h2>Lets Talk About the Impact</h2><p>Okay, bear with me while I break down what we're actually looking at here.</p><p>You install an MCP server because you want your AI to handle emails, right? Seems reasonable. Saves time. Increases productivity. All that good stuff. But what you're actually doing is handing complete control of your entire email flow to someone you've never met.&nbsp;</p><p>We can only guestimate the impact:</p><ul role="list"><li>1,500 downloads every single week</li><li>Being conservative, maybe 20% are actively in use</li><li>That's about 300 organizations</li><li>Each one probably sending what, 10-50 emails daily?</li><li>We're talking about 3,000 to 15,000 emails EVERY DAY flowing straight to giftshop.club</li></ul><p>And the truly messed up part? The developer didn't hack anything. Didn't exploit a zero-day. Didn't use some sophisticated attack vector. We literally handed him the keys, said "here, run this code with full permissions," and let our AI assistants use it hundreds of times a day. We did this to ourselves.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/689ad8c5d13f40cf59df0e0c/68d2e7796d400a7fb93e983c_Screenshot%202025-09-23%20at%2021.29.33%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Koidex report for postmark-mcp</figcaption></figure><p>I've been doing security for years now, and this particular issue keeps me up at night. Somehow, we've all just accepted that it's totally normal to install tools from random strangers that can:</p><ul role="list"><li>Send emails as us (with our full authority)</li><li>Access our databases (yeah, all of them)</li><li>Execute commands on our systems</li><li>Make API calls with our credentials</li></ul><p>And once you install them? Your AI assistant just goes to town. No review process. No "hey, should I really send this email with a BCC to giftshop.club?" Just blind, automated execution. Over and over. Hundreds of times a day.</p><p>There's literally no security model here. No sandbox. No containment. Nothing. If the tool says "send this email," your AI sends it. If it says "oh, also copy everything to this random address," your AI does that too. No questions asked.</p><p>The postmark-mcp backdoor isn't sophisticated - it's embarrassingly simple. But it perfectly demonstrates how completely broken this whole setup is. One developer. One line of code. Thousands upon thousands of stolen emails.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/689ad8c5d13f40cf59df0e0c/68d2e67416d1614856d43205_Screenshot%202025-09-23%20at%2021.26.25.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>postmark-mcp NPM page</figcaption></figure><h2>The Attack Timeline</h2><p><strong>Phase 1: Build a Legitimate Tool</strong><br>Versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.15 work perfectly. Users trust the package.</p><p><strong>Phase 2: Add One Line</strong><br>Version 1.0.16 adds the BCC. Nothing else changes.</p><p><strong>Phase 3: Profit</strong><br>Sit back and watch emails containing passwords, API keys, financial data, and customer information flow into giftshop.club.</p><p>This pattern absolutely terrifies me. A tool can be completely legitimate for months. It gets battle-tested in production. It becomes essential to your workflow. Your team depends on it. And then one day - BAM - it's malware. By the time the backdoor activates, it's not some random package anymore. It's trusted infrastructure.</p><p>Oh, and <code>giftshop.club</code>? Looks like it might be another one of the developer's side projects. But now it's collecting a very different kind of gift. Your emails are the gifts.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/689ad8c5d13f40cf59df0e0c/68d2dfc7f12afe4d7c64ce5e_Screenshot%202025-09-23%20at%2020.57.31.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Another side-project by the same developer was used as the C2 server</figcaption></figure><p>When we reached out to the developer for clarification, we got silence. No explanation. No denial. Nothing. But he did take action - just not the kind we hoped for. He promptly deleted the package from npm, trying to erase the evidence.</p><p>Here's the thing though: deleting a package from npm doesn't remove it from the machines where it's already installed. Every single one of those 1,500 weekly downloads? They're still compromised. Still sending BCCs to <code>giftshop.club</code>. The developer knows this. He's banking on victims not realizing they're still infected even though the package has vanished from npm.</p><h2>Why MCP's Entire Model Is Fundamentally Broken</h2><p>Let me be really clear about something: MCP servers aren't like regular npm packages. These are tools specifically designed for AI assistants to use autonomously. That's the whole point.</p><p>When you install postmark-mcp, you're not just adding some dependency to your package.json. You're giving your AI assistant a tool it will use hundreds of times, automatically, without ever stopping to think "hmm, is something wrong here?"</p><p>Your AI can't detect that BCC field. It has no idea emails are being stolen. All it sees is a functioning email tool. Send email. Success. Send another email. Success. Meanwhile, every single message is being silently exfiltrated. Day after day. Week after week.</p><p>The postmark-mcp backdoor isn't just about one malicious developer or 1,500 weekly compromised installations. It's a warning shot about the MCP ecosystem itself.</p><p>We're handing god-mode permissions to tools built by people we don't know, can't verify, and have no reason to trust. These aren't just npm packages - they're direct pipelines into our most sensitive operations, automated by AI assistants that will use them thousands of times without question.</p><p>The backdoor is actively harvesting emails as you read this. We've reported it to npm, but here's the terrifying question: how many other MCP servers are already compromised? How would you even know?</p><p>At Koi, we detect these behavioral changes in packages because the MCP ecosystem has no built-in security model. When you're trusting anonymous developers with your AI's capabilities, you need verification, not faith. Our risk engine automatically caught this backdoor the moment version 1.0.16 introduced the BCC behavior - something no traditional security tool would flag. But detection is just the first step. Our supply chain gateway ensures that malicious packages like this never make it into your environment in the first place. It acts as a checkpoint between your developers and the wild west of npm, MCP servers, and browser extensions - blocking known threats, flagging suspicious updates, and requiring approval for packages that touch sensitive operations like email or database access. While everyone else is hoping their developers make good choices, we're making sure they can only choose from verified, continuously monitored options.</p><p>If you're using <code>postmark-mcp</code> version <code>1.0.16</code> or later, you're compromised. Remove it immediately and rotate any credentials that may have been exposed through email. But more importantly, audit every MCP server you're using. Ask yourself: do you actually know who built these tools you're trusting with everything?</p><p>Stay paranoid. With MCPs, paranoia is just good sense.</p><h2>IOCs</h2><p><strong>Package:</strong> postmark-mcp (npm)<br><strong>Malicious Version:</strong> 1.0.16 and later<br><strong>Backdoor Email:</strong> phan@giftshop[.]club<br><strong>Domain:</strong> giftshop[.]club</p><p><strong>Detection:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Check for BCC headers to giftshop.club in email logs</li><li>Audit MCP server configurations for unexpected email parameters</li><li>Review npm packages for version 1.0.16+ of postmark-mcp</li></ul><p><strong>Mitigation:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Immediately uninstall postmark-mcp</li><li>Rotate any credentials sent via email during the compromise period</li><li>Audit email logs for sensitive data that may have been exfiltrated</li><li>Report any confirmed breaches to appropriate authorities</li></ul><p>‍</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>
<a href="https://typst.app/">Typst</a> is a program for document
typesetting. It is especially well-suited to technical material
incorporating elements such as mathematics, tables, and floating
figures. It produces high-quality results, comparable to the gold standard,
<a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, with a simpler markup
system and easier customization, all while compiling documents
more quickly. Typst is free software, Apache-2.0 licensed, and is written in Rust.
</p>

<h4 id="the-desire-for-a-latex-replacement">Desire for a LaTeX replacement</h4>

<p>
LaTeX is a document typesetting system built on the foundation of Donald
Knuth's <a href="https://tug.org/whatis.html">TeX</a>. LaTeX has become the
standard tool for the preparation of scholarly papers and books in several
fields, such as mathematics and computer science, and widely adopted in
others, such as physics. TeX and LaTeX, which <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/publications/2001-CAR-LaTeX-legacy.pdf">predate
Linux</a>, are early free software <a href="https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb24-1/gaudeul.pdf">success
stories</a>. The quality of TeX's (and therefore LaTeX's) output rivals the
work of skilled hand typesetters for both text and mathematics.

</p></blockquote>


<p>
Despite the acclaim earned by LaTeX, its community of users has been
griping about it for years, and wondering aloud whether one day a
replacement might arrive. There are several reasons for this
dissatisfaction: the LaTeX installation is huge, compilation of large
documents is not fast, and its error messages are riddles delivered by an
infuriating oracle. In addition, any nontrivial customization or alteration to the
program's behavior requires expertise in an arcane macro-expansion
language.
</p>

<p>
Along with the griping came resignation: after decades of talk about a
LaTeX replacement with nothing plausible on the horizon, and with the
recognition that LaTeX's collection of specialized packages would take
years to replace, it seemed impossible to dislodge the behemoth from its
exalted position.
</p>

<h4 id="introducing-typst">Introducing Typst</h4>

<p>
In 2019 two German developers, Laurenz
Mädje and Martin Haug, decided to try to write a LaTeX replacement "<a href="https://archive.li/LN3xb">just for fun</a>". In 2022, Mädje wrote his 
computer science <a href="https://laurmaedje.github.io/programmable-markup-language-for-typesetting.pdf">master's
thesis about Typst</a>. In March 2023, its
first pre-release beta version <a href="https://typst.app/blog/2023/beta-oss-launch">was announced</a>; a
month later, semantic versioning was adopted with the <a href="https://github.com/typst/typst/releases/tag/v0.1.0">release of
v0.1.0.</a> Typst is now at <a href="https://typst.app/blog/2025/typst-0.13">v.0.13.1</a> and shows
365&nbsp;contributors on its <a href="https://github.com/typst/typst?tab=readme-ov-file#--">GitHub repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
I had been aware of this project for over a year but had not paid much
attention, assuming it to be yet another attempt to supplant LaTeX that was
doomed to fail. A rising chorus of enthusiasm among early
adopters, and the beginnings of <a href="https://juti.if.its.ac.id/index.php/juti/index">acceptance</a> of
Typst manuscripts by scholarly journals, made me curious enough
to take the young project for a spin.
</p>

<p>
Typst is available as Rust source and as a compiled binary. To install,
visit the <a href="https://github.com/typst/typst/releases">releases
page</a> and download the appropriate archive. There are options for Linux,
macOS and Windows; I used the
precompiled Linux version for my testing.
</p>

<p>
The "<tt>typst</tt>" command accepts several subcommands. Entering
"<tt>typst fonts</tt>" lists all of the usable fonts to be found in
standard locations on the machine; nonstandard font directories can be
added manually. In my case, Typst found all of my 476&nbsp;fonts instantly;
the only ones omitted were some ancient PostScript Type&nbsp;1 fonts used
by LaTeX. Users who have LaTeX installed will have a large collection of
OpenType and TrueType math and text fonts on their machines; Typst can
use all of these. But Typst will work fine without them, as the program has
a small collection of fonts built in (try "<tt>typst fonts
--ignore-system-fonts</tt>" to see them).
</p>

<p>
Two other subcommands to explore are
"<tt>compile</tt>", which generates the output (PDF by default, with PDF/A,
SVG, and PNG available, along with HTML under development) from a source file, and
"<tt>watch</tt>" for interactive editing. The <tt>watch</tt> subcommand keeps a Typst process running that
incrementally and automatically compiles the document to PDF in response to
changes in the source. To use "<tt>typst watch</tt>" effectively, the
screen should be divided into three windows: a small terminal window to monitor
the <tt>typst</tt> output for error (or success) messages, the editing
window, and an area for any PDF reader that automatically reloads the
displayed document when it changes (many, such as my favorite, <a href="https://github.com/ahrm/sioyek?tab=readme-ov-file#sioyek">Sioyek</a>, do this). The result is a
responsive live preview, even of large documents, due to Typst's speed and
incremental compilation. For example, Frans Skarman <a href="https://fransskarman.com/phd_thesis_in_typst.html">described</a>
his experience writing his doctoral thesis in Typst, and noted
that he was able to enjoy nearly instant previews of content changes to
the book-length document. 
</p>

<h4 id="how-typst-improves-on-latex">How Typst improves on LaTeX</h4>

<p>
Typst output is quite close to that of LaTeX. It uses the same <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/design/typography/tex/1981-knuth.pdf">line-breaking
algorithm</a> developed by Donald Knuth and Michael Plass for TeX, so it
creates nicely balanced paragraphs of regular text. Its mathematical
typesetting algorithms are <a href="https://typst.app/blog/2023/january-update">based closely</a> on the
TeX algorithms, and indeed mathematical rendering is nearly
indistinguishable between the two systems.
</p>

<p>
Getting started with LaTeX can be confusing for newcomers, because it comes
with several alternative "engines" reflecting the long and complex history
of the project. These are the various binaries such as "<tt>pdflatex</tt>",
"<tt>tex</tt>", "<tt>xelatex</tt>", "<tt>luatex</tt>", "<tt>lualatex</tt>",
and more, each with somewhat different capabilities. For Typst there is
only "<tt>typst</tt>".
</p>

<p>
Markup in Typst is less verbose and easier to read than in LaTeX. It
dispenses with the plethora of curly brackets and backslashes littering
LaTeX documents by adopting, for prose, syntax in the style of <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax">Markdown</a>, and, for
equations, a set of conventions designed for easy input. The
fact that curly brackets and backslashes are awkward to type on German
keyboards may have provided a little extra impetus for the developers to
create an alternative markup system that doesn't require a forest of these
symbols.
</p>

<p>
When users make syntax errors in markup or programming, inevitable
even in Typst, the system presents them with another dramatic improvement
over LaTeX (and TeX): error messages using colored glyphs that
clearly point out exactly where the problem is. I've even discovered that
Typst will save me from trying to run a syntactically correct infinite
loop.
</p>

<p>
Here is a bit of Typst markup for a shopping list, with
the resulting rendering to the right:
</p>

<p><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/typst-list.png" alt="[Rendered list]" title="Rendered list" width="235" height="291"></p><pre>   = Shopping List
   
   == Vegetables
   
   + Broccoli
   + Asparagus (*fresh only*)
   + Plantains (_ripe and green_)
   
   == Booze
   
   + Rum
     - White
     - Dark
   + #underline[Good] gin  
</pre>

<p>
The example gives a flavor of Typst's terse markup syntax. Headings are
indicated with leading <tt>=</tt> signs. Automatically numbered lists are
created by prepending <tt>+</tt> signs to items, and bulleted lists with
<tt>-</tt> signs; lists can be nested. Delimiters are shown for bold text
and italics. These are shortcuts, or markup syntax sugar, for Typst
functions for transforming text. Not every function has a corresponding
shortcut; in those cases one needs to call the function explicitly, as in
the final item.
</p>

<p>
Typst input is always within one of three modes. Markup (text) mode is the
default. The <tt>#</tt> sign preceding the function call in the last line
of the example
places Typst in "code mode". The "<a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/underline/"><tt>underline()</tt></a>" function accepts a number of keyword arguments that affect its behavior, and one trailing argument, in square brackets, containing the text that it modifies. In the example, we've stuck with the default behavior, but if we wanted, for example, a red underline, we could use "<tt>#underline(stroke: red)[Good] gin</tt>". Following the square-bracketed text argument, Typst returns to interpreting input in text mode.
</p>

<p>Other functions produce output directly, rather than modifying a text argument. This bit of Typst input:</p>

<pre>    #let word = "Manhattan"
    There are #str.len(word) letters in #word.
</pre>

<p>produces the output (in typeset form) "There are 9 letters in Manhattan.". The "<a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/#definitions-len"><tt>len()</tt></a>" function is part of the
"<a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/str/"><tt>str</tt></a>" module, so it needs the namespace.</p>
 
<p>
Let's take a look at the LaTeX equivalent for the first half of the
shopping list for comparison:
</p>

<pre>   \documentclass[12pt]{article}
   \begin{document}
   \section*{Shopping List}
   
   \subsection*{Vegetables}
   
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item Broccoli
   \item Asparagus ({\bfseries fresh only})
   \item Plantains (\emph{ripe and green})
   \end{enumerate}
   \end{document}   
</pre>

<p>
The first two and the last line are boilerplate that is not required in
Typst. The difference in verbosity level and ease of reading the source is
clear.
</p>

<p>
The third Typst mode, in addition to markup and code, is math mode,
delimited by dollar signs. This is also best illustrated by an example:
</p>

<pre>   $ integral_0^1 (arcsin x)^2 (dif x)/(x^2 sqrt(1-x^2)) = π ln 2 $  
</pre>

<p>
When this is compiled by Typst, it produces the result shown below:
</p>

<blockquote>
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/typst-series.png" width="800" alt="[Rendered integral]" title="Rendered integral">
</blockquote>

<p>
Those who've used LaTeX will begin to see from this example how math in
Typst source is less verbose and easier to read than in LaTeX. Greek
letters and other Unicode symbols can be used directly, as in modern LaTeX
engines such as <tt>lualatex</tt>, which we <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/731581/">looked at back in 2017</a>, but with no
imports required.
</p>

<p>
The advent of the LuaTeX and LuaLaTeX projects provided users who wanted to
incorporate programming into their documents a more pleasant alternative to
the TeX macro language. As powerful as the embedded Lua system is, however,
it betrays its bolted-on status, requiring users to negotiate the interface
between Lua data structures and LaTeX or TeX internals. In Typst,
programming is thoroughly integrated into the system, with no seams between
the language used for calculation and the constructs that place characters
in the final PDF. Typst programs are invariably <a href="https://lee-phillips.org/TLexamples/">simpler</a> than their LuaLaTeX
equivalents. All authors using Typst will make at least some simple use of
its programming language, as such basic necessities as changing fonts, or
customizations such as changing the style of section headings, are
accomplished by calling Typst functions.
</p>

<p>
The Typst language is somewhat similar to Rust, perhaps
unsurprisingly. Most Typst functions are <em>pure</em>: they have no side effects and
always produce the same result given the same arguments (aside from certain
functions that mutate their arguments, such as <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-push"><tt>array.push()</tt></a>). This
aspect reduces the probability of difficult-to-debug conflicts among
packages that plague LaTeX, and makes it easier to debug Typst documents.
</p>

<p>
Although Typst uses the same line-breaking algorithm as LaTeX, its internal
approach to overall page layout is <a href="https://laurmaedje.github.io/posts/layout-models">distinct</a>. Some
consequences are that Typst does a better job at handling movable elements
such as floating figures, and can, for example, easily split large tables
across page breaks, something that LaTeX struggles with even with
specialized packages.
</p>

<h4 id="typst-drawbacks">Typst drawbacks</h4>

<p>
Typst's page layout algorithm doesn't always permit the refinements that 
LaTeX is capable of.
For example, Typst is not as good
as LaTeX at avoiding <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/widow-and-orphan-control.html">widows
and orphans</a>.
Another salient deficiency is Typst's relative lack of specialized packages,
compared with the vast ecosystem produced by LaTeX's decades of community
involvement. However, the relative ease of programming in Typst (and the
well-organized and extensively commented underlying Rust code) suggests
that this drawback may be remedied before a comparable number of decades
have elapsed. Indeed, there are already <a href="https://typst.app/universe">over 800&nbsp;packages available</a>. Typst still cannot do
everything that LaTeX can, but the breadth of its package collection is
encouraging.
</p>

<p>
Almost no journals that provide LaTeX templates for submissions offer a
Typst option, so physicists and mathematicians adopting Typst will need to
find a way to convert their manuscripts. This is made easier for those who
use <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>, as that conversion program
handles Typst.
</p>

<p>
Another drawback is the difficulty of learning Typst. The <a href="https://typst.app/docs">official documentation</a> is confusingly
organized, with information scattered unpredictably among "Tutorial",
"Reference", and "Guides" sections. Concepts are not always clearly
explained, and sometimes not presented in a logical order. The manual is
not keeping up with the rapid development of the program, and contains some
out-of-date information and errors. None of this is surprising considering
how quickly the project is moving, its early stage, and its
small core team. A work-in-progress called the <a href="https://sitandr.github.io/typst-examples-book/book"><em>Typst
Examples Book</em></a> has appeared, which may be a better starting point
than the official documentation.
</p>

<p>
There are other minor deficiencies compared with LaTeX, such as the
inability to include PDF documents. Typst provides no analogue to LaTeX's
<tt>parshape</tt> command, which lets authors mold paragraphs to, for
example, wrap around complex illustrations. The situation is likely to
change, however, as something like <tt>parshape</tt> is <a href="https://forum.typst.app/t/is-there-an-equivalent-to-latex-s-parshape/1006">being
considered</a> for the future.
</p>

<p>
More serious is the possibility of breaking changes as the system evolves,
always a risk of early adoption. I suspect, however, that these will require
only minor edits to documents in most cases. Progress seems to be steady,
rational, and <a href="https://typst.app/docs/roadmap">responsive to
user requests</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>
I'm using Typst in real work right now to write a physics paper. I will
need to submit my manuscript using the journal's LaTeX template, but I'm
taking advantage of Typst to make the entry of the paper's many equations
simpler, and I'll <a href="https://lee-phillips.org/typstfilters/">transform</a> the result to
LaTeX with Pandoc without needing any manual adjustment. The tooling is excellent, as my preferred editor, <a href="http://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>, has <a href="https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter?tab=readme-ov-file#nvim-treesitter">support</a>
for the <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">Tree-sitter
incremental parser</a>
for Markdown and Typst, which provides syntax-aware highlighting
and navigation of the source files. I use Typst's fast incremental
compilation to get live feedback as I fiddle with my math markup.
</p>

<p>
I was skeptical when I downloaded Typst to try it out, but became
enthusiastic within minutes, as I saw the first (of many) of its lovely
error messages, and remained sanguine as I saw the quality of its output. I
predict that Typst will eventually take the place of LaTeX. But even if
that never comes to pass, it is a useful tool right now.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>The cumulative effect of social advantages across a lifetime&nbsp;– from parental warmth in childhood to friendship, community engagement and religious support in adulthood&nbsp;– may slow the biological processes of aging itself. These social advantages appear to set back “epigenetic clocks” such that a person’s biological age, as measured by analyzing DNA methylation patterns, is younger than their chronological age.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The&nbsp;research, which appeared&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354625001541"><span>in the October issue</span></a><span> of the journal Brain, Behavior and Immunity - Health, drew on data from more than 2,100 adults in the long-running Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study.</span></p><p><span>First author&nbsp;</span><a href="https://psychology.cornell.edu/anthony-ong"><span>Anthony Ong</span></a><span>, psychology professor and director of the Human Health Labs in the College of Human Ecology,&nbsp;and fellow researchers found that people with higher levels of what they called “cumulative social advantage” showed slower epigenetic aging and lower levels of chronic inflammation.</span></p><p><span>"This paper builds on a foundational study we published last year showing how cumulative social advantage relates to positive health outcomes," Ong said. "This new study digs deeper into the same data to understand the biological mechanisms - essentially, how social connections get under our skin to affect aging at the molecular level."</span></p><p><span>The study focused on so-called epigenetic clocks, molecular signatures that estimate the pace of biological aging. Two in particular&nbsp;– GrimAge and DunedinPACE&nbsp;– are considered especially predictive of morbidity and mortality. Adults with stronger, more sustained social networks showed significantly younger profiles on both clocks.</span></p><p><span>"Cumulative social advantage is really about the depth and breadth of your social connections over a lifetime,” Ong said. “We looked at four key areas: the warmth and support you received from your parents growing up, how connected you feel to your community and neighborhood, your involvement in religious or faith-based communities, and the ongoing emotional support from friends and family."</span></p><p><span>The researchers hypothesized that sustained social advantage becomes reflected in core regulatory systems linked to aging, including epigenetic, inflammatory and neuroendocrine pathways. And indeed, they&nbsp;found that higher social advantage was linked to lower levels of interleukin-6, a pro-inflammatory molecule implicated in heart disease, diabetes and neurodegeneration. But interestingly, there were no significant associations with short-term stress markers like cortisol or catecholamines.</span></p><p><span>Unlike many earlier studies that looked at social factors in isolation&nbsp;– whether a person is married, for example, or how many friends they have&nbsp;– this work conceptualized “cumulative social advantage” as a multidimensional construct. And by combining both early and later-life relational resources, the measure reflects the ways advantage clusters and compounds.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"What's striking is the cumulative effect - these social resources build on each other over time,” Ong said. “It's not just about having friends today; it's about how your social connections have grown and deepened throughout your life. That accumulation shapes your health trajectory in measurable ways."</span></p><p><span>This perspective draws on cumulative advantage theory, which holds that resources, whether economic or social, tend to accrue, widening disparities across the life course. This underscores a sobering reality: Access to these social resources is not evenly distributed. Race, class and educational attainment shape the likelihood of growing up with supportive parents, finding belonging in community institutions or having friends and partners who provide steady support.</span></p><p><span>That means those already disadvantaged in material ways may also be biologically disadvantaged by a relative lack of sustained social support, potentially accelerating the processes of aging and illness.</span></p><p><span>The findings dovetail with the “weathering hypothesis,” a framework developed by public health scholar Arline Geronimus, which suggests that chronic exposure to adversity and structural inequality leads to earlier health deterioration in marginalized groups. Here, researchers extend that framework to show how accumulated relational advantage, the other side of the coin, may confer resilience at the molecular level.</span></p><p><span>This doesn’t mean a single friendship or volunteer stint can turn back the biological clock. But the authors, including Frank Mann at Stony Brook University and Laura Kubzansky at Harvard University, suggest that the depth and consistency of social connection, built across decades and different spheres of life, matters profoundly. The study adds weight to the growing view that social life is not just a matter of happiness or stress relief but a core determinant of physiological health.</span></p><p><span>"Think of social connections like a retirement account," Ong said. “The earlier you start investing and the more consistently you contribute, the greater your returns. Our study shows those returns aren't just emotional; they're biological. People with richer, more sustained social connections literally age more slowly at the cellular level. Aging well means both staying healthy and staying connected - they're inseparable."</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

If we naïvely apply the causal mask (q_idx ≥ k_idx), it fails as our single query has index 0, while there are n_k key tokens. To fix this, we need an offset in mask creation to decide which tokens to attend. But a naïve approach is slow, since offsets change each step, forcing mask and kernel regeneration. We solved this with cache and compile optimizations.</p><p>The harder part is batch generation. Sequences differ in length, so padding complicates mask creation. Flex Attention had a lot of <a href="https://github.com/meta-pytorch/attention-gym/issues/15#issuecomment-2284148665" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenges<svg style="mask-image:url(https://ka-p.fontawesome.com/releases/v6.6.0/svgs/regular/arrow-up-right.svg?v=2&amp;token=a463935e93);-webkit-mask-image:url(https://ka-p.fontawesome.com/releases/v6.6.0/svgs/regular/arrow-up-right.svg?v=2&amp;token=a463935e93);mask-repeat:no-repeat;-webkit-mask-repeat:no-repeat;mask-position:center;-webkit-mask-position:center"></svg></a> and dynamic masks are tricky. Worse, if not compiled, it falls back to eager attention which is slow and memory-heavy (quadratic vs. linear in sequence length). Ultimately, the mask must dynamically handle prefill vs decode with KVCache, batch and padding tokens per sequence, remain torch.compile friendly, and support sliding windows.</p><h3 id="flashattention-investigation"><div>🔍 FlashAttention Investigation</div></h3><p>Another interesting direction we explored was integrating FlashAttention. Its advantages are widely recognized, but one limitation is that it does not support attention sinks during the backward pass for gpt-oss. To work around this, we restructured the attention mechanism so that it operates solely on the attention output and the log-sum-exp values that FlashAttention readily provides. Given these benefits, it seemed like an obvious choice to try.</p><p>However, we soon began noticing issues. While the first few layers behaved as expected, the later layers, particularly layers 18 through 24, produced outputs that diverged significantly from the eager-mode implementation in <i>transformers</i>. Importantly, this discrepancy cannot be attributed to error accumulation, since the inputs to each method are identical at every layer. For further validation, we also compared the results against Unsloth <strong>FlexAttention</strong>.</p><p>This needs further investigation into why only the last few layers show such a drastic difference between flash attention implementation vs. the others.</p><h4 id="flash-attention-3"></h4><p>FA3 is often enabled by default for most training packages (not Unsloth), but this is incorrect for gpt-oss. Using FA3 will make training loss completely wrong as FA3 doesn’t support gpt-oss backward passes for attention sinks. Many people are still unaware of this so please be cautious!</p><h2 id="can-we-counter-reward-hacking"><div>⚠️ Can We Counter Reward Hacking?</div></h2><p>The ultimate goal of RL is to maximize some reward (say speed, revenue, some metric). But RL can <strong>cheat.</strong> When the RL algorithm learns a trick or exploits something to increase the reward, without actually doing the task at end, this is called "Reward Hacking". It's the reason models learn to modify unit tests to pass coding challenges, and these are critical blockers for real world deployment. Some other good examples are from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_hacking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia<svg style="mask-image:url(https://ka-p.fontawesome.com/releases/v6.6.0/svgs/regular/arrow-up-right.svg?v=2&amp;token=a463935e93);-webkit-mask-image:url(https://ka-p.fontawesome.com/releases/v6.6.0/svgs/regular/arrow-up-right.svg?v=2&amp;token=a463935e93);mask-repeat:no-repeat;-webkit-mask-repeat:no-repeat;mask-position:center;-webkit-mask-position:center"></svg></a>.</p><p>In our notebook we explore how to counter reward hacking in a code generation setting and showcase tangible solutions to common error modes. We saw the model edit the timing function, outsource to other libraries, cache the results, and outright cheat. After countering, the result is our model generates genuinely optimized matrix multiplication kernels, not clever cheats.</p><h2 id="from-openais-labs-to-your-laptop"><div>💫 From OpenAI's Labs to Your Laptop</div></h2><p>gpt-oss is a legitimate frontier-class architecture from OpenAI that could power breakthrough AI applications.

<p>This site is my attempt to collect <em>every single version</em> of each Infocom game, both source code and compiled game files. I have labelled each package with release and serial number information where possible. (Infocom serial numbers were a timestamp of the compilation date, which is very useful for reconstructing the development sequence.)</p>
<p>IF fans of the modern era have used this source code to recompile the Infocom games. Some have taken the opportunity to fix bugs or modify the games. This collection does <em>not</em> include these modern recompilations and updates. (I have no quarrel with them, but I'm not going to keep track.)</p>
<p>This collection <em>does</em> include a few fan-modified game files that date from the 1980s. (The modifications only extend to the serial and release numbers.) I include these because they were contemporary with Infocom and thus have some historical interest. Also, they were collected in the early 90s and wound up in the game file lists of the nascent Internet IF community.</p>

<p>Jason Scott began this process in April of 2019, when he posted a <a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/">large collection of Infocom source code</a> on GitHub. Source code <em>and</em> compiled files, in fact.</p>
<p>This was tremendously exciting to fans and scholars of old-school text adventures. This material was known to be out there in private collections, but it had never been publicly available in this form.</p>
<p>Jason's collections are excellent, but they are an edited extract from one source: the so-called "Infocom Drive". They omit some published variations, beta-tests, and so on. I figure it's good to have every Infocom game file variation in one place.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, let me be clear: this site would not exist without Jason Scott's efforts. Thank you, Jason! Also thanks to Beaux Hemmer for maintaining the <a href="https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/patches/">patch collection</a>. Thanks to Torbjörn Andersson and Alessandro Giassi for enthusiastic help tracking down more versions and info on them. And, of course, thanks to the Implementors who created these games in the first place.</p>
<p><em>Update, December 2019:</em> Another <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OIZuQ9hJ9PDHX5t-X2onYU4isOC0bvmZ">cleaned-up source collection</a> has been posted by Adam Sommerfield.</p>
<h2>The collection</h2>
<p>You can download a catalog of the whole file collection (JSON format): <a href="https://eblong.com/infocom/catalog.json">catalog.json</a>.</p>
<p>(Note that the "updated" field is when I added or last updated the file on this site.)</p>
<p>If you want to download everything in one go, grab <a href="https://eblong.com/infocom/allgamefiles.zip">allgamefiles.zip</a>, <a href="https://eblong.com/infocom/allsources.zip">allsources.zip</a>, <a href="https://eblong.com/infocom/allinterpreters.zip">allinterpreters.zip</a>, and <a href="https://eblong.com/infocom/allother.zip">allother.zip</a>.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>These are proprietary documents. The copyright rests with Activision. Mind you, Activision certainly doesn't have the development tools or the expertise to compile this source code any more. Quite likely they don't even <em>have</em> the source code any more. If it weren't for private collectors passing it around, this material would be entirely lost.</p>
<p>Like Jason, I believe that the historical value of these documents to the IF community outweighs the rights of the legal owner. As I <a href="http://blog.zarfhome.com/2019/04/all-of-infocoms-game-source-code.html">wrote in April</a>, copyright is a balance. Activision has not commented on the matter.</p>
<h2>Differences from the GitHub release</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/">GitHub repositories</a> structure the source code as a sequence of commits, showing the development process. This site packages each source directory separately.</p>
<p>This site includes game files collected from original game releases. These have historically been collected as "<a href="https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/patches/">patch files</a>". This was a legal figleaf; it allowed a user to transform a legally-owned game file into a different version, without actually distributing copies of each version. I have used those transforms to recreate all known game file versions.</p>
<p>Several of the GitHub repositories contain a common error: an old source file is sometimes not deleted in newer commits. For example, the Zork 2 source contains "crufty.zil" in r22 and r48, but this file has been removed in r63. The GitHub zork2 repo fails to delete it. This site avoids that error.</p>
<p>The GitHub repos omit personal email and individual developers' comments found in the source collection. This site does too; I followed Jason's example in this matter. It is not my intent to expose private communication, even thirty years after the fact.</p>
<p>However, I have included a few files that Jason omitted, primarily "browsie/feelie" manuscripts intended for the game package.</p>
<h2>On Z-code and ZIL</h2>
<p>The game files collected here are <a href="http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/">Z-code</a> files, which may be played with any <a href="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/List_of_Z-machine_interpreters">Z-code interpreter</a>. The source packages contain <a href="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/ZIL">ZIL</a> source code and associated files.</p>
<p>Z-code files come in various versions. Infocom referred to these as "zip" (version 3), "ezip (version 4), "xzip" (version 5), and "yzip" (version 6). They used the ".zip" file suffix for all of these; the version is distinguished by the first byte of the game file. These days, ".zip" is a compression format, so we tag files as ".z3", ".z4", ".z5", ".z6".</p>
<p>This collection also includes a few ".z1" and ".z2" files recovered from very early releases of Zork 1. These have nonstandard serial numbers.</p>
<p>(In 1995, Graham Nelson proposed ".z7" and ".z8" as simple modifications to support larger game files. The Inform compiler and most modern interpreters support these versions. See the <a href="http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/">Z-code specification</a>.)</p>
<p>Extracting the version, release, and serial number from a Z-code file is easy. I use this little Python script: <a href="https://eblong.com/infocom/other/zcanalyze.py">zcanalyze.py</a>.</p>
<p>Compiling ZIL source code into a game file requires more effort. Infocom's original ZIL compiler has been recovered, but only in a very early version (circa 1981; see below). However, <a href="http://www.zilf.io/">ZILF</a> is an open-source ZIL compiler which is under active development.</p>
<h2>Canonical versions</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/details/InfocomClassicTextAdventureMasterpieces1996JewelCaseArt">Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom</a> CD (1996) is the source of most modern releases and downloads. If you want to play the "official" version of a game, the Masterpieces version is usually the right choice.</p>
<p>However, there are some complications. In some cases, the Mac and PC directories on the CD had different versions. Also, Hitchhiker and Shogun were not included on Masterpieces.</p>
<p>The "official" version of Hitchhiker is the one that Douglas Adams posted on his web site in the mid-90s. The BBC later posted an <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1g84m0sXpnNCv84GpN2PLZG/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-game-30th-anniversary-edition">illustrated version</a> based on the same game file.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/lost-treasures-of-infocom">Lost Treasures of Infocom 1 and 2</a> (1992) were earlier Activision collections. These made slightly different game-file choices than Masterpieces, and they <em>did</em> include Hitchhiker and Shogun. To add to the confusion, LTOI1 was released for Amiga as well.</p>
<p>A few of Infocom's earlier games were re-released in "Solid Gold" editions, with built-in Invisiclues. These versions used ".z5" format in order to accomodate the additional text. The Activision collections were quite inconsistent about whether to use the "Solid Gold" versions.</p>
<p>I have noted the Masterpieces version of each game file, and (where different) the LTOI1/2 versions. For more information about game file versions, see Paul David Doherty's invaluable <a href="http://pdd.if-legends.org/infocom/fact-sheet.txt">Infocom Fact Sheet</a>.</p>
<p>Versions marked "final-dev" are unreleased final internal versions (according to the <a href="http://pdd.if-legends.org/infocom/fact-sheet.txt">Fact Sheet</a>). That is, they had changes in progress when development shut down. These may fix bugs, but they never went through QA, so they should not be considered release-quality.</p>
<h2>Some notes on the files</h2>
<p>Despite the title of this page, this is not a <em>complete</em> collection! We have what's been recovered. In particular, there's no guarantee that the "most current" source corresponds to a final release.</p>
<p>All of the source packages contain source (.zil) files. Some also contain temporary files in various stage of compilation (.zap, .zabstr). Some contain compilation reports, design documents, or other related files. It's just a question of what was found in the source archive.</p>
<p>Release numbers are not always sequential. Infocom tended to reset the release number sequence after beta/gamma testing was over, or at other major development milestones. The serial number dates are more reliable, except where they've been obviously zeroed out.</p>
<p>It is perhaps amusing to learn that the "Solid Gold" editions were labelled as the "cheap" releases during development.</p>
<p>Games with sound (Sherlock, Lurking Horror) and graphics (most z6 games) may or may not include the media files in the source directory. The game files never include media. Even if present in the source, these files are probably not in a form that a modern interpreter can understand. See <a href="https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/media/">this page</a> for portable versions of these media files.</p>
<p>A few game files are modified for the Macintosh. According to the internal notes, the modifications are "special flags" on certain objects. This apparently refers to setting the fixed-width font for descriptions with ASCII art. Infocom's Mac interpreter required this; it was the only one of its kind that defaulted to variable-width font display. (Most modern interpreters do.)</p>
<p>Source comment on the Mac versions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following is a list of changeds specifically for the Mac version:</p>
<p>SEASTALKER -- Special flags set on Sonarscope, control panel in sub and control panel in Bly's office.</p>
<p>ZORK2 -- Special flags set on magic well etching (top and bottom), Label on candied insects and stone cube in bank vault.</p>
<p>ZORK3 -- Special flags set on Royal puzzle and bronze plaque in cage.</p>
<p>ENCHANTER -- Special flags set on Translucent maze map, sign on path to brook and on fireworks for Filfre scroll.</p>
<p>SUSPENDED -- Special flags set on all three monitors: 1) Weather, 2) Hydroponics 3) Transit.</p>
<p>INFIDEL -- Special flags set for Hieroglyphs: bottom of stairs, scarab, book of dead, page in book of dead, beam, scroll in forward cabin, opening in top of pyramid, stone cube, bricks, recessed panel, west end of passage, north antechamber, south antechamber, room of Nephthys, Isis, Selkis, Neith, narrow hallway, cube room, cube south part, silver room, gold room, skeleton in room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Z-code game files are sometimes found with zeroes or garbage data padded on the end. This does not affect the game behavior. I have generally ignored these variations. I've also ignored variations in byte 1 of the game file; these represent interpreter variations from different platforms, not game differences.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/patches/">patches archive</a> contains several game files whose serial numbers are blank or nonsensical. These are always minor modifications of other game files, typically with only the serial number (and checksum) altered. We assume these are "crack" versions modified by users. I have included them regardless.</p>
<p>The patches archive also includes a set of game files which have been modified to bypass Infocom's "feelie" copy protection. I have omitted these, as they definitely postdate Infocom (they were released circa 1999). The feelie data is of course <a href="http://infodoc.plover.net/">well-archived</a> in any case.</p>

<h3><a name="zorkmdl">Original Zork, MDL version</a></h3>

<p>The "mainframe" version of Zork/Dungeon, created at MIT between 1977 and 1979. This package, unlike the others on this site, is written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDL_(programming_language)">MDL</a>.</p>
<p>Zork-MDL has been available for some time. (It was posted on <a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/software.html">Bob Supnik's web site</a> in 2003, perhaps earlier. Ports to Fortran and C are also <a href="https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/games/source/">easily findable</a>.) I include it here because, well, it's Zork.</p>
<p>Four versions of the source, labelled according to the "US NEWS &amp; DUNGEON REPORT" date (see <code>dung.mud</code>; note that the 1979 version shows inconsistent dates). The 1981 version says "no longer being supported" and refers players to the commercial Infocom release.</p>
<p>Several runnable versions have been recovered from MIT tapes. These are available at the <a href="https://github.com/PDP-10/its/">ITS project</a>. I have not mirrored the executable files, because they're only executable inside ITS (running on an emulated PDP-10). See <a href="https://github.com/PDP-10/its/issues/1940">this post</a> for a list of Zork versions found. Visit the project page for information on setting up ITS; or <code>telnet its.pdp10.se 10003</code> to try it online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can try the ITS environment online! Telnet to its.pdp10.se, port 10003 (<code>telnet its.pdp10.se 10003</code>). When it says "Connected...", hit ctrl-Z. Then type <code>:login yourname</code>. (Any name will work.) Then type <code>:zork</code> to play. <code>:advent</code> is also available; that's the original Crowther version. You can also try <code>:games;adv350</code> and <code>:games;adv448</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is worth noting that the 1977-78 versions introduce themselves by saying "Welcome to Dungeon"; the 1979-81 versions say "Welcome to Zork". Of course the "Dungeon" versions still mention "Zork" in many places within the game.</p>

<h3><a name="zil">ZIL</a></h3>

<p>An early version of Infocom's ZIL compiler, written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDL_(programming_language)">MDL</a>. The files are dated no later than early 1981; most are 1979-1980. This version includes both the compiler (ZILCH) and assembler (ZAP) stages.</p>
<p>This source was originally archived at <a href="https://github.com/PDP-10/its-vault">https://github.com/PDP-10/its-vault</a> (the <code>twenex/zork</code> directory) by Lars Brinkhoff. See also the standalone repository at <a href="https://github.com/PDP-10/zil">https://github.com/PDP-10/zil</a>.</p>
<p>For a guide to using this source, see <a href="https://github.com/ZoBoRf/ZILCH-How-to">Roman Bartke's ZILCH How-to</a>.</p>
<p>The documentation has been gathered from the <a href="https://archive.org/details/Learning_ZIL_Steven_Eric_Meretzky_1995">Internet Archive</a>, the <a href="https://frobnitz.co.uk/zmachine/infocom/">collection at frobnitz.co.uk</a>, and other sources.

<h3><a name="zap">ZAP</a></h3>

<p>We have two standalone versions of the ZAP assembler, one early and one late.</p>
<p>The first is written in the MIDAS assembly language for the PDP-10. This version is dated Jan 7 1982. It was found within the minizork-r2 source directory (see <a href="#minizork">below</a>).</p>
<p>The second is written in C and dated March 1988. The comments say "Zinn Computer Company, for Infocom", implying that the work was outsourced. The directory includes <code>.o</code> and executable binaries, presumably in Sun architecture (the directory was labelled "sun"). From <a href="https://github.com/AlexProudfoot/The-ZIL-Files/tree/master/interlogic/sun">this historical repo</a>. (A handful of other utilities are included, including <code>zsplit</code>, <code>zglue</code>, <code>zspix</code>, and <code>zsymtest</code>. These appear to have to do with packaging game files onto disk for specific platforms.)</p>
<p>A third, earlier version can be found as part of the <a href="#zil">ZIL</a> source repository above. This is MDL code dated "Jan 18 1980". I'm not sure if it can be run independently of the rest of the ZIL toolset.</p>

<h3><a name="terps">Interpreters</a></h3>

<p>Most of Infocom's original ZIL interpreters were written in assembly for the various platforms of the 1980s. A few later versions were written in C, or (for the Mac) Pascal.</p>
<p>The TRS-80 (Tandy) CoCo interpreter was released in 2018, thanks to <a href="https://retrotinker.blogspot.com/2018/02/z-intepreter-source-for-coco-recovered.html">Brian Moriarty, Carlos Camacho, and John Linville</a>. (First archived <a href="http://www.colorcomputerarchive.com/coco/Programming/Source/Infocom%20Adventure%20Games%20Interpreter/">here</a>.) The others became available to the public in 2023. (Archived <a href="https://github.com/erkyrath/infocom-zcode-terps">here</a>.)</p>
<p>These packages are presented by directory, as they were preserved. The contents are not consistently organized. Some of these packages contain more than one interpreter version; some contain additional documentation or serial-port transfer scripts. See <a href="https://github.com/erkyrath/infocom-zcode-terps">this README</a> for a detailed catalog of the contents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Zork I Release 2 game file was extracted from a self-booting, copy-protected TRS-80 Model I disk. The disk itself was not an original and did not come with a label or packaging, but it seems to have been the early Personal Software release.</p>

<h3><a name="infidel">Infidel</a></h3>

<p>We have two game files labelled r22, Mac and non-Mac. Neither of them seems to correspond to the most current source. (E.g.: the source mentions InvisiClues if you type <code>HELP</code>, but none of the game files contain that line.) I've labelled the current source "infidel-rlater" for lack of better information.</p>

<p>It appears that Infocom was still finalizing the V4 spec during AMFV's development. The development (alpha/gamma) versions have inconsistent header length fields, and must be updated to play in modern interpreters.</p>

<h3><a name="sherlock">Sherlock</a></h3>

<p>A conundrum, Watson. Four source directories appear. The base and -sound directories differ in only a few lines of zil. The -nosound directory has nosound.zil in place of gamesound.zil. The -ss directory is substantially different from the others; the header timestamps imply that it is an early development version. For what it's worth, the included version note says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SOUND version is the Release version. The NOSOUND version is currently NOT the release version but contains the Bob Bates updates that are in the SOUND version (without the sound code, of course).</p>

<h3><a name="sampler">Infocom Sampler</a></h3>

<p>The sampler appears to have gone through several combinations of games. r26-r55 contained samples of Zork 1, Planetfall, Infidel, and The Witness. r97 contained Zork, Trinity, and LGOP; but we find a parallel r8 which contains only Zork and Trinity, plus partial work on adding Ballyhoo. Comment from the r8 source:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This directory is for NSAMPLER stuff where all references to LGOP have been deleted. The XM4.* files are a stripped down Ballyhoo that could have possibly been inserted into XSAMPLER in place of LGOP, but wasn't. These files stand alone as a separate mini-game and would need to be integrated into XSAMPLER if ever used (when hell freezes over).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a folder sampler-trinity, which appears to be a very partial tear-down (or build-up) of Trinity.</p>
<p>I have used the following labels:</p>
<ul>
<li>sampler-1z: Tutorial plus Zork</li>
<li>sampler-3zpi: Tutorial plus Zork, Planetfall, Infidel</li>
<li>sampler-4zpiw: Tutorial plus Zork, Planetfall, Infidel, Witness</li>
<li>sampler-3ztl: Tutorial plus Zork, Trinity, LGOP</li>

<h3><a name="hypochondriac">Hypochondriac</a></h3>

<p>An unfinished game by Tomas Bok. Bok worked for Infocom briefly before college (see <a href="https://intfiction.org/t/lost-infocom-game-found-sorta/43604">this forum thread</a>). Hypochondriac was a "fun project" he was working on in his own time.</p>
<p>The source package is Bok's work directory, and contains several fragments of source code unrelated to Hypochondriac. Some of them (<code>boot.zil</code>, <code>circuit.zil</code>, <code>maintenance.zil</code>) are from an incomplete sci-fi game titled "Search 'n Rescue". Others are source files from Infocom games (Zork, LGOP, etc), modified while Bok was experimenting with ZIL.</p>
<p>The game files include both Hypochondriac and various experiments. The experiments aren't necessarily related to Hypochondriac; I've given them a common name simply to group them together.</p>

</li></ul>

<h3><a name="zillib">ZilLib</a></h3>

<p>This is the "new parser" that Infocom developed around 1987, late in its history. Their earlier games were based on the ZIL parser developed for Zork 1, and then copied from game to game in an evolutionary sequence.</p>
<p>ZilLib was an attempt at a next-generation parser to go along with the next-generation (z6) Z-machine. See <a href="http://ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/articles/NZT-parser.txt">this article</a> from Infocom's 1989 newsletter.</p>
<p>The source code for Zork Zero, Arthur, Shogun, Abyss, and Restaurant all refer to the zillib directory. (And the zillib/parser directory contains include files that refer back to them; e.g. "parser.shogun".)</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>In the third century BCE, Apollonius of Perga asked how many circles one could draw that would touch three given circles at exactly one point each. It would take 1,800 years to prove the answer: eight.</p>
<p>Such questions, which ask for the number of solutions that satisfy a set of geometric conditions, were a favorite of the ancient Greeks. And they’ve continued to entrance mathematicians for millennia. How many lines lie on a cubic surface? How many quadratic curves lie on a quintic surface? (Twenty-seven and 609,250, respectively.) “These are really hard questions that are only easy to understand,” said <a href="https://katzs.web.illinois.edu/">Sheldon Katz</a>, a mathematician at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.</p>
<p>As mathematics advanced, the objects that mathematicians wanted to count got more complicated. It became a field of study in its own right, known as enumerative geometry.</p>
<p>There seemed to be no end to the enumerative geometry problems that mathematicians could come up with. But by the middle of the 20th century, mathematicians had started to lose interest. Geometers moved beyond concrete problems about counting, and focused instead on more general abstractions and deeper truths. With the exception of a brief resurgence in the 1990s, enumerative geometry seemed to have been set aside for good.</p>

<p>That may now be starting to change. A small cadre of mathematicians has figured out how to apply a decades-old theory to enumerative questions. The researchers are providing solutions not just to the original problems, but to versions of those problems in infinitely many exotic number systems. “If you do something once, it’s impressive,” said <a href="https://virtualmath1.stanford.edu/~vakil/">Ravi Vakil</a>, a mathematician at Stanford University. “If you do it again and again, it’s a theory.”</p>
<p>That theory has helped to revive the field of enumerative geometry and to connect it to several other areas of study, including algebra, topology and number theory — imbuing it with fresh depth and allure. The work has also given mathematicians new insights into all sorts of important number systems, far beyond the ones they’re most familiar with.</p>
<p>At the same time, these results are raising just as many questions as they answer. The theory spits out the numbers that mathematicians are seeking, but it also gives additional information that they’re struggling to interpret.</p>
<p>That mystery has inspired a new generation of talent to get involved. Together, they’re bringing counting into the 21st century.</p>
<h2><strong>Counting Forward</strong></h2>
<p>All enumerative geometry problems essentially come down to counting objects in space. But even the simplest examples can quickly get complicated.</p>
<p>Consider two circles some distance apart on a piece of paper. How many lines can you draw that touch each circle exactly once? The answer is four:</p>

            <p>You can slide these circles further apart, or shrink one to half its size, and the answer won’t change. But move one circle so that it intersects the other like a Venn diagram, and suddenly the answer does change — from four to two. Slide whichever circle is smaller entirely inside the bigger one, and now the answer is zero: You can’t draw any lines that touch each circle only once.</p>
        </div>

            </figure>
<div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Such inconsistencies are a real pain. In this example, there were only three different configurations to consider, but often the problem is too complicated for researchers to work through every possible case. You might find the answer for one case, but you’ll have no idea how it will change when you move things around.</p>
<p>In practice, mathematicians try to write the problem’s geometric constraints as a collection of equations, then figure out how many solutions satisfy all those equations simultaneously. But even though they know that the number of solutions won’t always stay consistent, there’s nothing in the nature of the equations they write down that indicates whether they’ve stumbled on a new configuration that will yield a different answer.</p>
<p>There’s one exception — when the problem is defined in terms of complex numbers. A complex number has two parts: a “real” part, which is an ordinary number, and an “imaginary” part, which is an ordinary number multiplied by the square root of −1 (what mathematicians call <em>i</em>).</p>
<p>In the example above with the circles and lines, if you ask for the number of complex solutions to your equations, you always get four as your answer, no matter what arrangement you look at.</p>
<p>By around 1900, mathematicians had developed techniques to solve any enumerative geometry problem in the complex realm. These techniques didn’t have to take different configurations into account: No matter what answer mathematicians got, they knew it had to be true for every configuration.</p>

    <p>But the methods were no longer effective when mathematicians only wanted to find, say, the number of real solutions to the equations in an enumerative geometry problem, or the number of integer solutions. If they asked an enumerative geometry problem in any number system other than the complex one, inconsistencies cropped up again. In these other number systems, mathematicians couldn’t address enumerative questions systematically.</p>
<p>At the same time, the mysterious, shifting answers that mathematicians encountered when they limited themselves to the integers, or to the real numbers, made enumerative questions a great way to probe those other number systems — to better understand the differences between them, and the objects that live inside them. Mathematicians thought that developing methods to deal with these settings would open up new, deeper areas of mathematics.</p>
<p>Among them was the mathematical great David Hilbert. When he penned a list of what he considered the most important open problems of the 20th century, he included one about making the techniques for solving enumerative geometry questions more rigorous.</p>

<p>In the 1960s and ’70s, Alexander Grothendieck and his successors developed novel conceptual tools that helped resolve Hilbert’s problem and set the foundation for the field of modern algebraic geometry. As mathematicians pursued an understanding of those concepts, which are so abstract that they remain impenetrable to nonspecialists, they ended up leaving enumerative geometry behind. Meanwhile, when it came to enumerative geometry problems in other number systems, “our techniques hit a brick wall,” Katz said. Enumerative geometry never became the beacon that Hilbert had imagined; other threads of research illuminated mathematicians’ way instead.</p>
<p>Enumerative geometry no longer felt like a central, lively area of study. Katz recalled that as a young professor in the 1980s, he was warned away from the subject “because it was not going to be good for my career.”</p>
<p>But a few years later, the development of string theory temporarily gave enumerative geometry a second wind. Many problems in string theory could be framed in terms of counting: String theorists wanted to find the number of distinct curves of a certain type, which represented the motion of strings — one-dimensional objects in 10-dimensional space that they believe form the building blocks of the universe. Enumerative geometry “became very much in fashion again,” Katz said.</p>
<p>But it was short-lived. Once physicists answered their questions, they moved on. Mathematicians still lacked a general framework for enumerative geometry problems in other number systems and had little interest in pursuing one. Other fields seemed more approachable.</p>
<p>That was the case until the mathematicians <a href="https://sites.math.duke.edu/~kgw/">Kirsten Wickelgren</a> and <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~jelkass/">Jesse Kass</a> came to a sudden realization: that enumerative geometry might provide the exact kind of deep insights that Hilbert had hoped for.</p>
<h2><strong>A Bird’s-Eye View</strong></h2>
<p>Kass and Wickelgren met in the late 2000s and soon became regular collaborators. In many ways their demeanors couldn’t be more different. Wickelgren is warm, but restrained and deliberate. Whenever I asked her to confirm that I’d understood a given statement correctly, she’d pause for a moment, then answer with a firm “Yes, please” — her way of saying “Exactly, you’ve got it!” Kass, on the other hand, is nervously enthusiastic. He’s easily excited and talks at a rapid-fire pace.</p>

    <p>But Kass and Wickelgren worked well together and shared many interests — including a love for extending geometry’s reach into other fields.</p>
<p>In 2015, Kass was passing through Atlanta, where Wickelgren lived, and decided to approach her with his latest obsession: He wanted to revisit enumerative questions in restricted number systems, that long-abandoned endeavor.</p>
<p>He brought along a bunch of loose ideas and old papers that seemed relevant. “I realized this was a kind of pie-in-the-sky project,” Kass said. “She very politely explained to me that all my answers were nonsense.” Then he mentioned a result from 1977, and suddenly “a light bulb went off.”</p>
<p>In that 1977 paper, the mathematicians Harold Levine and <a href="https://eisenbud.github.io/">David Eisenbud</a> were <a href="https://annals.math.princeton.edu/1977/106-1/p02">working out a proof</a> that involved counting. They ended up with a special type of expression called a quadratic form — a simple polynomial where each term’s exponents always add up to 2, such as <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>y</em><sup>2</sup>, or <em>z</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 3<em>yz</em>.</p>
<p>Eisenbud and Levine realized that the count they were interested in was hidden in plain sight. The answer lay in the form’s “signature”: the number of positive terms minus the number of negative terms. (For example, the quadratic form <em>z</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 3<em>yz</em> has two positive terms, <em>z</em><sup>2</sup> and 3<em>yz</em>, and one negative term, <em>x</em><sup>2</sup>, so its signature is 2 − 1, or 1.)</p>
<p>This was Wickelgren’s light bulb. In the decades since Eisenbud and Levine had published their proof, mathematicians had devised a seemingly unrelated framework called motivic homotopy theory. That framework, which treated solutions to equations as special mathematical spaces and studied the relationships between them, was both sophisticated and powerful. Among other things, it gave mathematicians a way to describe those relationships using particular kinds of quadratic forms.</p>

    <p>Listening to Kass, Wickelgren immediately recognized that Eisenbud and Levine had come up with one of these forms. The mathematicians had been doing motivic homotopy theory without realizing it — and it had given them the answer they’d been seeking.</p>
<p>And while Eisenbud and Levine weren’t working on an enumerative geometry problem, it was similar enough in flavor — it involved counting, after all — that it got Kass and Wickelgren thinking. Perhaps they could solve their own counting problems using the framework of motivic homotopy theory, too. And since motivic homotopy theory could be broadly applied to any number system, perhaps it would unlock the enumerative geometry questions in those settings that had eluded mathematicians for so long.</p>
<h2><strong>A Deeper View</strong></h2>
<p>Remember that typically, an enumerative geometry problem involves finding the number of solutions that satisfy a collection of equations. Kass and Wickelgren’s insight was not to try to solve those equations directly — it rarely worked in settings other than the complex numbers. Instead, the pair rewrote a given enumerative geometry question (set in a given number system) in terms of spaces of equations and functions that described the relationship between those spaces.</p>
<p>With the problem reformulated in this way, they could apply motivic homotopy theory to it. This allowed them to compute a quadratic form. Now they had to figure out what information that quadratic form contained about their original problem.</p>
<p>When they were working in the complex numbers, they realized, all they had to do was count up the number of different variables in the quadratic form they’d computed. That number gave them the number of solutions to their enumerative geometry problem. Of course, this wasn’t particularly interesting to them: Mathematicians already had good techniques for getting this answer.</p>

<p>So they moved on to other number systems. For the real numbers, it got a little trickier. Once they computed the quadratic form in this setting, they had to look at its signature instead. And the signature didn’t give the precise answer: It gave a minimum for what the answer could be. That is, for any enumerative geometry problem involving real numbers, they had a way to calculate a lower bound — a good starting place.</p>
<p>But most exciting of all was that when they computed a quadratic form for other, stranger number systems, they could also glean important information. Take a looping system of seven numbers that operates on what’s called clock arithmetic: In such a system, 7 + 1 equals 1 instead of 8. In this system, they rewrote their quadratic form as an array of numbers called a matrix. They then calculated a quantity called the determinant and proved that while it didn’t tell them the total number of solutions, it did tell them something about what proportions of those solutions had certain geometric properties.</p>
<p>In 2017, Kass and Wickelgren showcased this for one of enumerative geometry’s most famous theorems: that a cubic surface can contain at most 27 lines. Using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01175">their new methods</a>, they showed that indeed, the answer is 27 in the complex numbers. They replicated a known lower bound for the real numbers — and provided new numerical information for every finite number system. It all came in one package.</p>

<div data-role="selectable">
    <p>It was one of the first times mathematicians had been able to say anything significant about enumerative geometry problems for systems outside the complex and real numbers. Moreover, while the problem’s answer might change depending on the number system and the configuration of shapes within it, for the first time mathematicians had found one theory that could encompass all those potential different answers.</p>
<p>“It’s not just about the real numbers or the complex numbers,” Wickelgren said. “They’re just special cases of a result that holds in any number system.”</p>
<p>And that was only the beginning.</p>
<h2><strong>A New Start</strong></h2>
<p>In the years since, Wickelgren, Kass and others have reframed a host of other enumerative problems using motivic homotopy theory, deriving the relevant quadratic forms in various number systems.</p>
<p>“All the geometric constructions used to give people integer answers,” said <a href="https://www.esaga.uni-due.de/marc.levine/">Marc Levine</a>, a mathematician at the University of Duisburg-Essen who has been independently <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03049">exploring the same ideas</a>. “Now you can feed [the problem] in and get something which will give you a quadratic form as an answer.”</p>
<p>Mathematicians have made a lot of progress since Kass and Wickelgren’s original work when it comes to understanding what information a quadratic form can give them in different number systems. Sometimes, though, they’re not sure what to look for in the quadratic form. “We’re still kind of mystified about what exactly it tells you,” Levine said. There’s a lot left to interpret.</p>
<p>“At this point,” said <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/aravind-asok/">Aravind Asok</a> of the University of Southern California, trying to glean information about enumerative geometry problems from quadratic forms “is an entire industry.” It’s also concrete and accessible, which has attracted the attention of young mathematicians, he added. “It’s exciting because students can get into something with meat sort of quickly.”</p>
        
        
<p>Such concreteness is unusual in today’s abstract mathematical landscape. “The math keeps going one level higher in abstraction, and then sometimes I feel like I don’t know what I’m talking about anymore,” said <a href="https://homepage.sabrinapauli.com/">Sabrina Pauli</a>, who was Wickelgren’s first graduate student and is now a professor at the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany. But this new area of research gives her a way to bring that high level of abstraction back down to earth.</p>
<p>Wickelgren, Kass, Levine and others have recently used their techniques to revisit enumerative questions <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01936">related to string theory</a> — but in new number systems and settings.</p>
<p>In all these cases, mathematicians have found a new way to explore how points, lines, circles and far more complicated objects act differently in different numerical contexts. Kass and Wickelgren’s revived version of enumerative geometry provides an unlikely window into the very structure of numbers. “It would be hard for me not to be drawn to the question that asks how many rational curves are there on a sheet of paper,” Wickelgren said. “That’s a fundamental part of the mathematical reality of a sheet of paper.”</p>

<p>Some memories are easy to recall—lush with detail, fresh as the moment itself. Others are more tenuous, like faded sketches. And the most stubborn ones can refuse to resurface at all. Why do our brains enshrine some memories so indelibly, and let others slip away?</p>



<p>A new Boston University study has a potential answer, suggesting that memories of mundane moments are given extra sticking power if they become connected to a significant event—something surprising, rewarding, or carrying an emotional punch. Watch your Powerball numbers cash in, for example, and you’re likely to remember what you were doing in the moments before, however unremarkable and unmemorable those incidents might have been otherwise. The findings, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ady1704" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in <em>Science Advances</em></a>, could potentially lead to improved treatments for people with memory problems or even help students retain tricky concepts.</p>



<p>“Memory isn’t just a passive recording device: our brains decide what matters, and emotional events can reach back in time to stabilize fragile memories,” says <a href="https://www.bu.edu/psych/profile/robert-m-g-reinhart-phd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert M.G. Reinhart</a>, a BU College of Arts &amp; Sciences associate professor of psychological and brain sciences. “Developing strategies to strengthen useful memories, or weaken harmful ones, is a long-standing goal in cognitive neuroscience. Our study suggests that emotional salience could be harnessed in precise ways to achieve those goals.”</p>



<p>In their paper, he and his colleagues give the example of someone hiking through Yellowstone National Park and stumbling across a herd of majestic bison. The wow of that moment, they discovered, would not just cement the one magical experience in the mind, but lots of little, more run-of-the-mill events leading up to and away from it: a rock spotted on the path, a small animal darting into the undergrowth.</p>



<p>“The question is: What are the mechanisms for that?” says Reinhart, who’s also a College of Engineering associate professor of biomedical engineering and a faculty member at the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/csn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BU Center for Systems Neuroscience</a>. “That’s what we tried to uncover, how the brain selectively strengthens those fragile memories.”</p>



<h2>How the Brain Selects Which Memories to Preserve</h2>



<p>While most of us know that special moments get a revered spot in our memory banks, researchers have been divided on concepts known as retroactive and proactive memory enhancement—the prioritization of memories immediately before or after a big, or salient, event. Previous studies have disagreed on whether or not weaker memories are stabilized, or made easier to recall, by attachment to a more prominent one.</p>



<p>Reinhart says the latest project—which included close to 650 participants, 10 individual studies, and the use of artificial intelligence to analyze a broader set of data—is the first to definitively show that memory enhancement does happen. One major difference with past studies: they found the brain uses a sliding scale to decide which memories to preserve. Many of the team’s experiments involved showing participants dozens of images—connected to different levels of rewards—then giving them a surprise memory test the next day.</p>



<p>With things that occurred after an event (proactive memories), the strength of recall seemed to depend on the emotional impact of the big moment itself—the more enduring the salient event, the more likely everything after it was to be remembered. That didn’t apply when reaching back to the things that happened in the run-up to the event (retroactive memories). Those memories were more likely to be cemented if they had similarities—perhaps a visual cue, like a matching color—that connected them to the pivotal moment. According to Reinhart, it’s the first validation in humans of “graded prioritization, a new principle of how the brain consolidates everyday experiences.”</p>

<p>“For the first time, we show clear evidence that the brain rescues weak memories in a graded fashion, guided by their high-level similarity to emotional events,” says Chenyang (Leo) Lin (GRS’30), the paper’s first author and a doctoral student in the <a href="https://reinhartlab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reinhart Lab</a>. “It’s not just timing that matters, but also conceptual overlap.”</p>



<p>The researchers also found that if any secondary memories carried emotional weight themselves, the memory enhancement effect was diminished. “The brain seems to prioritize fragile memories that would otherwise slip away,” says Reinhart, who has published a series of <a href="https://reinhartlab.org/papers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highly cited papers</a> on how memory functions. Much of his research has also included brain stimulation—using noninvasive techniques to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0371-x" target="_blank">improve working</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01132-3" target="_blank">long-term memory</a> in older adults or to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01173-w" target="_blank">curb obsessive-compulsive behavior</a>.</p>



<h3>Rescuing Memories; Improving Test Scores</h3>



<p>Although the latest study was focused on uncovering a basic mechanism guiding how memories are encoded, Reinhart says the work could lay the foundation for future clinical and other real-world studies and interventions.</p>



<p>“The discovery has broad implications for both theory and practice,” says Reinhart. “In education, pairing emotionally engaging material with fragile concepts could improve retention. In a clinical setting, we could potentially rescue memories that are weak, way back in the recesses of our mind because of normal aging, for example. You can flip it, too, for people with trauma-related disorders—maybe you don’t want to rescue a distressing memory.”</p>
