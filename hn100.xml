<p>I woke up this morning about an hour ahead of my alarm, the sky already light, birds calling.&nbsp; After a few minutes, a brief patter of rain swept across the roof and moved on.</p>

<p>I just lay there, not really thinking.&nbsp; Feeling.&nbsp; Remembering.</p>

<p>Almost sixteen years to the minute before I awoke, my second daughter was born.&nbsp; Almost ten years to the same minute before, she’d turned six years old, already semi-unconscious, and died not quite twelve hours later.</p>

<p>So she won’t be taking her first solo car drive today.&nbsp; She won’t be celebrating with dinner at her favorite restaurant in the whole world.&nbsp; She won’t kiss her niece good night or affectionately rag on her siblings.</p>

<p>Or maybe she wouldn’t have done any of those things anyway, after a decade of growth and changes and paths taken.&nbsp; What would she really be like, at sixteen?</p>

<p>We will never know.&nbsp; We can’t even guess.&nbsp; All of that, everything she might have been, is lost.</p>

<p>This afternoon, we’ll visit Rebecca’s grave, and then go to hear her name read in remembrance at one of her very happiest places, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anshe_Chesed_Fairmount_Temple">Anshe Chesed Fairmount Temple</a>, for the last time.&nbsp; At the end of the month, the temple will close as part of a merger.&nbsp; Another loss.</p>

<p>A decade ago, I said that I felt the weight of all the years she would never have, and that they might crush me.&nbsp; Over time, I have come to realize all the things she never saw or did adds to that weight.&nbsp; Even though it seems like it should be the same weight.&nbsp; Somehow, it isn’t.</p>

<p>I was talking about all of this with a therapist a few days ago, about the time and the losses and their accumulated weight.&nbsp; I said, “I don’t know how to be okay when I failed my child in the most fundamental way possible.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t fail her,” they said gently.</p>

<p>“I know that,” I replied. “But I don’t feel it.”</p>

<p>A decade, it turns out, does not change that.&nbsp; I’m not sure now that any stretch of time ever could.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The boxes came from Tokyo: first by tanker, then overland via container truck from a Pacific port, across the Continental Divide, and finally backed into a driveway at the end of a cul-de-sac in a south Denver suburban enclave. This was a neighborhood with Razor scooters dumped in trimmed front lawns. Where family walks with leashed dogs happened down the middle of intentionally curved streets named after long demolished natural landmarks like "Timbercrest" and "Forest Trails." Where the HOA (because of course there was an HOA) banned the installation of driveway basketball hoops.</p><p>Receiving industrial freight deliveries, freshly cleared through international customs, probably wasn't explicitly prohibited in the homeowner's handbook. But then, why would it need to be? Nobody would think to bring that kind of commercial chaos into the burgeoning middle-class peace of Castle Pines North in 1998.</p><p>If neighbors peeking behind curtains at the idling 18-wheeler thought to call in a complaint, the husband and wife receiving the delivery didn't notice. They were too busy unloading boxes—more than 800 of them.&nbsp;</p><p>Balancing four at a time on a handcart, it took 200 trips through the open garage door and down the unfinished basement steps. The boxes, holding smaller rectangular packages inscribed with Japanese lettering, were piled to the ceiling. There was enough room left for a skinny aisle leading back up the stairs, and two plastic tables ladened with tape and flat-rate USPS packaging.&nbsp;</p><p>5,800 miles away, a man in middle management at the global toy conglomerate Hasbro must have been very pleased. The delivery represented a small yet unexpected boon.&nbsp;</p><p>Those boxes were dead inventory, wasting space in a nondescript warehouse. They should have been headed for a landfill and a tax write-off. Instead, a Mr. Toshio Takiguchi brokered the export at a ¥1,300 per-unit cost. Not a tidy profit, but no longer a loss on the annual P&amp;L. The remains of a failed business decision disappeared across the ocean. It was a certain Mr. Fox's problem now.</p><p>That problem cost $43,000, a sum that represented the entire life savings of Mr. Fox and his wife, who at that point had been surviving on public-school salaries. Friends and family never really said it out loud, but they were certainly thinking it: <em>This was insane. What about the three kids and that mortgage?&nbsp;</em></p><p>The couple, though, never had a doubt.&nbsp;</p><p>"He always used to tell me, 'If I had 10,000 of these, I could sell them in a year,'" Mrs. Fox&nbsp;recalled, 27 years later.</p><p>That's the unabashed confidence you'd expect from any good entrepreneur, especially with the benefit of hindsight. But ask yourself this: Would you, watching this couple unload box after box into their bank-financed home, have bet on this man and his family's future if you knew exactly what he needed to sell?</p><p>Tucked inside those boxes, in nested columns of 12, were 120,000 plastic cups. They were turned upside down, each with a hole drilled through the middle of the base, rendering them useless in terms of a cup's normal, and really only, task.</p><p>The couple's future hinged on accomplishing what the world's second largest toy company could not: convincing thousands of kids that stacking these plastic cups in pre-determined patterns was … <em>fun</em>. More critically, the couple needed to convince the parents of those kids to actually buy these cups, despite not even being able to drink from them.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Takiguchi could breathe a sigh of relief. Mr. and Mrs. Fox had to get to work.</p><hr><div><figure><img src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710" alt="Three speed stacking cups in a row"></figure><div><blockquote><p><strong><em>The first thing you need to know about Bob Fox is that he used to be a clown</em></strong> ... <em><strong>The second thing you need to know about my dad is that he was a really, really good clown.&nbsp;</strong></em></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div></div><hr><p>Every few months, in different corners of the internet, someone asks a version of the same question: <em>Why did we all stack plastic cups in elementary school PE class?</em></p><p>You'll see it multiple times in the Reddit community<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zillennials/comments/qmx0jx/anyone_else_remember_cup_speed_stacking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> r/Zillenials,</a> or infrequently posted as a random musing on <a href="https://x.com/lincolnwjohnson/status/1129999148567019520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> and Facebook. In 2023, it was examined in a 25-minute YouTube video with 200,000 views titled, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-iSGG3uD6s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What happened to this strange early 2000s craze?</a>"</p><p>You might have even asked it yourself, perhaps after a few beers when a friend turned some Solo Cups upside down, activating one of your mid-aughts memories of sitting cross-legged on a linoleum gym floor, surrounded by the clatter of your classmates piling cups into pyramids.</p><p><a href="https://www.speedstacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sport Stacking</a>, as it's officially known (cup stacking and speed stacking as it is colloquially known), exists in the same cloud of millennial nostalgia where you'll find vague recollections of SlamBall and JoJo. It has appeared on pretty much every morning and late show, been a trend piece in both the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/sports/sport-stacking-speed-cups.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>New York Times</em></a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124044351073445491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>, and was once labeled by Glenn Beck as "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/story/glenn-beck-why-health-care-reform-is-like-cup-stacking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what’s really wrong with America</a>."</p><p>It has been a minor plot line in <em>Fred Claus</em>, Matt LeBlanc's <em>Episodes</em>, and <em>Weeds</em>; it's been the major plot line in a 2022 Thai-language film released on Netflix titled <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18357588/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fast &amp; Feel Love</em></a> (100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes). The infamous "Oh my gosh!" scream in Skrillex's "Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites" was sampled from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j54yGxuk0yo&amp;t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">viral sport stacking video</a> from 2008.</p><p>At its peak, between 2002 and 2011, roughly 5,000 American schools included it as part of their annual curriculum, according to Mr. and Mrs. Fox. That means somewhere between five and eight percent of U.S. adults between the ages of 22 and 35 share the same core memory—and in the ensuing years have asked themselves, their friends, or social media the same question: <em>Why did credentialed educational professionals make us do this ludicrous activity in gym class?</em></p><p>I am, perhaps, the person best suited on the planet to answer this question.&nbsp;Because the answer … is my dad.</p><p>The first thing you need to know about Bob Fox is that he used to be a clown. Not in the figurative, funnyman personality sense. In the literal red-nose, black-eyeliner, juggling-tennis-balls-at-children’s-birthday-parties sense.</p><p>The second thing you need to know about my dad is that he was a <em>really, really good clown</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>He'd scoff at the mental image you probably have of him right now: oversized shoes, cartoonish honks, and bumbling choreography. My dad's act was entirely silent, required immense skill, and was predicated on audience participation. He was equally good at riding a unicycle and convincing the most curmudgeonly dad in the room to leave their back corner and join him onstage to try—and always fail—at blowing up a balloon animal. Kids went bananas. Adults always laughed.&nbsp;</p><p>The San Francisco 49ers hired him to be the walk-around entertainment for their post–Super Bowl ring ceremony in 1995. We used to shut the shades so neighbors didn't think he robbed a bank as he counted the cash he earned during Denver's largest busking festival.</p><p>This was a man who took the unserious very, very seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>As a high school theater teacher, he'd spend 60–80 hours a week building out increasingly elaborate sets for the annual musical. He built a life-sized plant puppet that could actually eat cast members for <em>Little Shop of Horrors</em>, and cut a full-sized muscle car in half so it would fit on stage during <em>Grease</em>; another car was hoisted onto the school's roof to promote the show. Before her bevy of Oscar nominations, Amy Adams was one of his choreographers and students.</p><p>He quit because his wife, Jill, needed him home more to help raise their three children. So he became an elementary school classroom and PE teacher instead, where he would end up teaching hundreds of kids how to ride unicycles and produce an annual show on the blacktop basketball court called KidZircus.</p><p>The first thing you need to know about Jill Fox is that before working as a communications administrator at a school district, she used to be a journalist at a small newspaper, where she was assigned to write a profile about a local clown on "sabbatical" from his full-time job.&nbsp;</p><p>The second thing you need to know about Jill Fox is that despite the word "sabbatical" doing a generous amount of euphemistic work in her final published piece, she married that unemployed clown.</p><p>This was a woman who was very, very good at seeing—and supporting—the potential in the crazy.</p><hr><div><figure><img src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710" alt="Three speed stacking cups in a row"></figure><div><blockquote><p><strong><em>They had to figure out how to tap into the supply chain of global toy conglomerates. Fortunately, they had a guy: Uncle Johnny.</em></strong></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div></div><hr><p>It took them 10 months to sell the 10,000 sets of 12 cups.&nbsp;</p><p>Kids in south Denver, it turns out, went absolutely nuts over this new phenomenon called "cup stacking." That's mostly because my dad figured out the one thing Hasbro did not: The level of interest in the activity hinged almost exclusively on the enthusiasm and skill level of a real-life teacher. Without that, it was just inanimate plastic ephemera sitting on a shelf.</p><p>The basic rules take about 15 minutes to learn. Like a track meet, the sport is built on completing different "distances" as fast as you can. The shortest, and simplest, is called the 3-3-3. Envision each one of those 3's as a nested column of cups. You start on one side and "upstack" the first 3 into a pyramid, then move to the middle, and then the last 3. Then you return to where you started, and "downstack" them back into columns in the same order. The 3-6-3 has the same principle, but with a pyramid of six cups in the middle. The "Cycle," is the sport's primetime event, starting with the 3-6-3, morphing into a 6-6, and ending with a 1-10-1.</p><p>If you skimmed over that clunky paragraph, you've proved my dad's foundational epiphany: You really need to see it to buy in. In fact, scrap reading this for a few seconds (that's all it will take) and watch this video instead.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Fastest Cup Stacker Sets New World Record | Cup Stacking" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VyyscuIq56I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Place a set of these cups in the corner of a room or on a toy shelf with paper instructions, and you might earn five minutes of an 8-year-old's frenzied attention. Put that same 8-year-old on the gym floor in front of a professionally trained clown with a passion for juggling, and they will be utterly hooked.</p><figure><img alt="Three speed stacking cups in a row" src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"></figure><p>A brief digression on nomenclature: The sport was known as "cup stacking" until 2005, when my parents had the savvy to officially change the name to "sport stacking." Why? 1) Because it sounds way cooler, and if enough people call it a sport then it must damn well be one. 2) The phrase "cup stacking" out of context evokes toddlers playing with blocks, a vibe they wanted to avoid. Confusingly, you might have also seen it referenced as "speed stacking," after the company they eventually founded, Speed Stacks. They strategically eschewed this label to avoid the fate of Roller Blades, Frisbee, and Kleenex, all formerly good standing trademarks, until you lot ruined everything. </p><p>Except for this early-stage reference, I'll be calling it sport stacking hereafter so as to avoid a grumpy phone call from my dad (he'll probably still call about my use of "damn," though). If you have a problem with that, consider the last time you went berserk over a nine-darter or screamed at the Swedish curling team during the Olympics. As my dad likes to say, there used to be a man trying to convince the world that tossing balls made from dried cow skin into retrofitted peach baskets was fun—and you all bought in.</p><figure><img alt="Three speed stacking cups in a row" src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"></figure><p>It is important to note that my dad did not actually invent sport stacking. Credit goes to a group of bored kids at a Boys and Girls Club in Oceanside, Calif., in the early 1980s. They'd been given a stack of paper cups, and told to figure out a game that didn't involve messy liquid. Under the guidance of a program director named Wayne Godinet, both the rules and equipment evolved. He is responsible for the sport's first major innovation: He drilled a hole through the base of hard plastic cups to reduce air friction and prevent sticking. The California group's high-water mark came on Nov. 2, 1990, when they appeared on <em>The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson</em>. Among the millions watching that night, from his bed in a south Denver suburb: a clown and future PE teacher who thought it looked a bit like upside-down juggling.</p><p>Hasbro must have been watching, too. Perhaps chasing the Hoola Hoop and Pogs high of the '80s, the company scooped up a license to sell "Kup Stax," popping sets in a rectangular plastic sleeve on toy store shelves around the world. Instead of becoming a fad, the product moved to the clearance rack. Someone in middle management was probably scolded. Manufacturing ceased.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1995, my dad attended a physical education development workshop to give new teachers a dozen ideas on how to keep kids occupied, exercised, and docile. The classics were all there: four-wheeled square scooters designed to give 80 percent of users elbow burn, dodgeballs primed to pop kids like me in the face, that large circus tent you toss above your head until it temporarily inflates so you can sit under it for a few seconds. So were the cups.&nbsp;</p><p>He brought them home and taught his kids. I was 4, my brother 6, our sister 9. We not only fell in love with them, we got good—<em>fast</em>. We weren't outliers. Among an elementary school of 500 students, 250 signed up for an afterschool program to keep stacking. My mom drove to every Toys "R" Us and Walmart within a 50-mile radius. She bought every set of Kup Stax she could find. They were always discounted, tucked in a back corner.</p><p>The local supply ran dry as my parents hosted workshops. Demand started to skyrocket from other PE teachers. My parents needed to go upstream. They had to figure out how to tap into the supply chain of global toy conglomerates. Fortunately, they had a guy: <em>Uncle Johnny</em>.</p><p>Now 64 with a Colonel Sanders goatee and passion for intricate leather carving, my dad's brother has been at certain points in his life: a professor at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College; a street mime in San Diego; a director of&nbsp;a Las Vegas magic show, performed entirely on ice; and a consultant for Japan's oldest and largest circus. If you need to find a man in middle management at Hasbro's Tokyo corporate office, you call Uncle Johnny.</p><p>The deal was struck. The shipment arrived. And the cups, rather magically, disappeared from our basement.</p><p>By 1998, Bob Fox was a dealer with no product and an increasingly addicted customer base. There was only one logical next step: Transition from distribution to fabrication.</p><p>He did make a final good-faith effort to partner with the sport's originator, Wayne Godinet, offering to purchase $20,000 worth of product. It was almost a third of the profit earned from reselling the Japanese shipment. Godinet sent back two sample sets with a bill for the cost of goods and shipping.</p><p>In a similar vein, Nike was founded in 1964 only after a running shoe company called Onitsuka lost interest in partnering with a recent Oregon track grad named Phil Knight. While his shoe empire was born between the grooves of a waffle iron, Bob and Jill's cup empire was sketched on the back of a Fresh Fish Co. paper placemat.</p><p>Speed Stacks LLC was incorporated in December 1998. My parents quit their full-time public school jobs in June 2000.&nbsp;</p><p>This was to be an official test of a core tenet of the American Dream: With enough passion and even more prodigious work ethic, you can turn a ludicrous idea into a successful business. To get started, they just needed four things.</p><p>First: a mold to mass produce the cups. It required $20,000 and overcoming the absolute befuddlement of executives at a Denver plastics manufacturer who did not understand the <em>explicit request</em> to include three small holes at the base. As each cup came off the line, our family would inspect the shape; minor defects in its roundness caused sticking. Nearly every cup in the first run had to be tossed out for deformities.</p><p>Second: a nylon and mesh cup-carrying bag. Those were sewn in the back basement of a Vietnamese immigrant–owned textile company. We bagged each set of 12 by hand, my parents staying up until 2:00 in the morning to fulfill orders after working full school days. Bob wasn't satisfied unless the logo of every cup perfectly faced forward.</p><p>Third: to hit the road. Speed Stack's first tagline was "See it! Believe it! Teach it!" My parents meant it: They knew that success was linearly related to the number of PE teachers who witnessed the sport in person. Our family of five put almost 100,000 miles on our 1997 maroon Suburban in a little over four years.</p><p>Fourth: kids who could stack the cups. <em>Outrageously fast</em>. For some reason, all three of the Fox progeny developed both the interest and intrinsic skill to do just that.</p><hr><div><figure><img src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710" alt="Three speed stacking cups in a row"></figure><div><blockquote><p><strong><em>At a booth in hotel conference halls and city convention centers, we'd stack for hours, drawing crowds spread three and four rows deep, often to the annoyance of the dodgeball or shuttlecock purveyors next door.&nbsp;</em></strong></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div></div><hr><p>Legendary ring announcer Michael Buffer’s voice was always our music cue. <em>"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the main event!"</em>&nbsp;</p><p>It would blast over portable speakers on either side of a gym floor. Emmy, my older sister, would lead us out from a hidden corner, followed by my brother, Brennan, then me: a 7-year-old with Coke-bottle glasses, immensely satisfied by the fact that hundreds of eyes were watching my every move.</p><p>We stopped when we reached separate tables spread evenly across our makeshift stage, usually under the basketball hoop. We stood still to let the tempo build.&nbsp;</p><p><em>"Let’s get ready to rumble!"</em></p><p>The synths would drop, and we would commence stacking plastic cups. Faster and with more skill than the students and teachers in Amarillo or Ft. Lauderdale or Butzbach, Germany, or Copenhagen, Denmark, could ever think possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Our family performed hundreds of school assemblies in almost every corner of the country (and some overseas). The 30-minute spectacle was choreographed specifically to blow the minds of kids between the ages of 7 and 14 as quickly as possible. This wasn't a talk from your fire chief about safety, or puppets teaching you the value of sharing. We humiliated principals and popular teachers by making them race us. There was a fabricated jacket with holes cut in the back that we fitted onto a volunteer, then stuck our arms through the sleeves to make it appear like they were magically adept (performed to the <em>Rocky</em> soundtrack). The finale was a choreographed stacking routine, set to "Dueling Banjos" from <em>Deliverance</em>.</p><p>But a school-by-school roadshow wasn't a scalable business model. So we went to the nexus of physical education sweatsuitdom: state and national teacher conventions. At a booth in hotel conference halls and city convention centers, we'd stack for hours, drawing crowds spread three and four rows deep, often to the annoyance of the dodgeball or shuttlecock purveyors next door.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="The author stacking cups as a child." src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Kit-1996.jpeg?w=320" srcset="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Kit-1996.jpeg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Kit-1996.jpeg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Kit-1996.jpeg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Kit-1996.jpeg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Kit-1996.jpeg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Kit-1996.jpeg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span>The author stacking cups as a child</span><span></span><span>Kit Fox/Defector</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's most likely that you learned how to sport stack because your teacher, with a lanyard badge bouncing over her multi-colored windbreaker on her way to get a free muffin from the guys who sell tug-o-war ropes, stopped in her tracks in the back corner of Exhibit Hall B at an exurban Renaissance hotel. She would watch as our hands manipulated dishware so fast it blurred.</p><p>If my dad was adept at putting on a good show, my mom was equally adept at corralling the press. Her journalism and PR–honed chops put sport stacking in front of millions, from the D-block of local newscasts to 30 Rock Plaza during the <em>Today Show</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>That's how I found myself chatting with a shirtless Simon Cowell in the makeup room before we both appeared on Ellen DeGeneres's show, taught Tiki Barber the basics of the 3-3-3, and tried to convince a baffled Michael Caine in the green room of <em>LIVE with Regis and Kelly</em> that yes, indeed, kids really do stack plastic cups for fun.</p><p>All press, to my parents, was good. My dad was absolutely thrilled when Glenn Beck spent four minutes of his daily Fox News monologue staring directly into the camera, railing against the dangers of stacking cups.</p><p>"We can't fix our country by keeping our children weak," Beck sputtered, roughly two minutes in. "They need to have spines. They need to get hit in the face a few times with a ball, you know what I mean? They have to learn how to live with and thrive on past failures."</p><p>Brands soon took advantage of sport stacking's essential power: No matter the context, it attracts near-instant attention. In 2005, I appeared in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxwybLaGciSxQJgS1FKh-3PeJwa9xtXtN8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nationwide Comcast commercial</a> for high speed internet. FritoLay shut down part of Times Square to feature our stacking talents as it launched Stax, a competitor to Pringles. A beverage company in England flew a dozen of us to London to help launch an abomination of a drink called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eelE8tHEScM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Freekee Soda</a>. Main ingredient? Carbonated milk. (Did I pretend to enjoy drinking that carbonated milk so as to not piss off any of the execs helping to pay for my college education? Obviously. But it is a cursed flavor.)</p><p>Perhaps the only media my parents turned down was an appearance on the infamous reality show <em>Wife Swap</em>. The producers, naturally, presumed the scions of a ludicrous gym activity would have some weird baggage to mine for the masses.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, despite the cups, we were pretty normal.</p><hr><div><figure><img src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710" alt="Three speed stacking cups in a row"></figure><div><blockquote><p><strong><em>To stack as fast as you possibly can in a World Championship is to strike a balance between fluidity and chaos.</em></strong></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div></div><hr><p>It was the Germans who made everything more serious.</p><p>They arrived at the 2004 World Sport Stacking Championships in matching flag-inspired sweatsuits. Multiple coaches would analyze everything from hand-tag efficiency during the four-person relay event to the mental routines of stackers before their individual competition.</p><p>Sport stacking, I believe, grew into a minor phenomenon for three reasons: 1) It's visually arresting, 2) it's easy to learn, and 3) competing against the clock is incredibly addicting.</p><p>Media buzz and schoolteachers kindled the first two. But my dad's magnum opus—the reason the sport didn't wither in the way of skip ball and snake boards—was that he (with the help of the 20 employees at the burgeoning HQ) built the infrastructure and equipment to spur global competition.&nbsp;</p><p>The sport's growth coincided with two of my dad's innovations: the StackMat, a patented self-timing device that allowed kids to practice on their own for hours, aiming to trim hundredths of a second off their best times; and the World Sport Stacking Association, a governing body to codify the rules and serve as the keeper of world, national, and local records.</p><p>In 1997, 250 kids were hand-timed with stop watches at the first Colorado State Championship.&nbsp;By 2007, ESPN aired an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm8EKnl4ZDQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hourlong David Lloyd–hosted special</a> of the World Championships, featuring more than 1,000 competitors from seven countries (re-aired in 2020 during their pandemic "The Ocho" promotion).&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Stackers compete at the World Speed Stacking Championships" src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Stack-of-Champions.jpeg?w=640" srcset="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Stack-of-Champions.jpeg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Stack-of-Champions.jpeg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Stack-of-Champions.jpeg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Stack-of-Champions.jpeg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Stack-of-Champions.jpeg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/Stack-of-Champions.jpeg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span>Stackers compete at the World Speed Stacking Championships</span><span></span><span>Kit Fox/Defector</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like everything in his life, my dad choreographed a spectacle. He ordered a three-story banner to hang behind garbage can–sized cups that served as center stage. The competition floor was arranged with dozens of tables, all marked with laser-lined tape to demarcate relay boundaries.</p><p>During the final "Stack of Champions," the top competitors (and relay teams) from each event competed under the scrutiny of spotlights, three officials, an instant replay camera, and hundreds of spectators. In individual events, you're allotted two warmups and three tries. Relays are conducted head-to-head in teams of four.</p><p>For a few years, I was among those finalists.&nbsp;</p><p>To stack as fast as you possibly can in a World Championship is to strike a balance between fluidity and chaos. Push too hard and the cups tumble. Pull back and you'll lose by thousandths of a second.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="World Sport Stacking Championships 2007" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yxokrklbcdw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A relay race in the Stack of Champions, in which I (the third stacker on the left team) stumble at the start, allowing my brother (the last stacker on the right team) to beat us by two-hundredths of a second.</figcaption></figure></div><p>For those moments, you exist at the outer physical boundary of human biology. When performing at your peak, the cups feel less like they're being stacked and more like they're being sprayed.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2001, the world record for sport stacking's marquee event, the Cycle, was 7.43 seconds. It was held by my sister. At the time, most people assumed a sub-seven-second time was physically impossible. The pattern requires more than 40 separate moves. At those speeds, hands make micro-adjustments faster than the brain can register. Her time stood for nearly four years.</p><p>In 2025, the world record for the cycle is 4.739 seconds.&nbsp;</p><p>Please understand: I know this whole endeavor is silly, that it's worthy of your slight mockery and general patina of confusion. But also understand that my dad created a culture in which German coaches passed strategic tips to Australian competitors. Where Japanese teenagers became pen pals with suburban Texans. Where nerves collapsed faster than the cups. Where kids and adults shrieked with joy over millisecond improvements. Where tension and drama and friendship mingled with the clattering cacophony of sliding and tapping plastic (there really is no sound like the one at these competitions).&nbsp;</p><p>Sport stacking had broad exposure in both mainstream and weird places. But it had a deep impact in a much smaller community. It changed lives.</p><hr><div><figure><img src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710" alt="Three speed stacking cups in a row"></figure><div><blockquote><p><strong><em>You've probably heard Rachael’s voice. Her effusive reaction on a stacking YouTube video meant for her small group of friends is behind the iconic "YES, OH MY GOSH!" scream, sampled in one of EDM's most mainstream hits, "Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites," by Skrillex.</em></strong></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div></div><hr><p>Milo Ferguson discovered sport stacking in first-grade PE class.&nbsp;</p><p>"My teacher was the final boss of butch lesbians. That's the only way I know how to describe her," Ferguson, now a 23-year-old co-founder of an independent animation studio, said. Their teacher loved competition and was beloved by her students, exactly the archetype to stop at a conference booth and believe in a quirky new cup-centric educational trend.</p><p>Rachael Nedrow, now a 29-year-old product manager at Amazon, first saw the sport while scrolling YouTube when she was 11. She pulled paper cups from the kitchen drawer to try and mimic the movement.</p><p>Both became obsessed, quickly. Though for different reasons.</p><p>"I was never the fastest kid. I was always kind of chubby. I was much more the creative person than an athletic one," Ferguson said. "Sport stacking was about hand-eye coordination more than strength. It was intricate. Delicate." For the first time, they were excited to attend PE class.</p><p>Nedrow, an accomplished tennis player, was intrigued by the self-improvement and rigid strictures of the clock. She bought an official set of Speed Stacks and started logging her progress on her own YouTube channel.</p><p>"My first competition was at a local church," Nedrow said. "I did terribly, but I still won."</p><p>Despite differing motivations, Ferguson and Nedrow's paths to competitive sport stacking mirror each other. Friends weren't interested, so they went looking for a community online and at competitions.&nbsp;</p><p>For the thousand kids that congregated on the arena floor at each World Championships, like Ferguson and Nedrow, the sentiment was common. They had found <em>their</em> people. They fit in, sometimes for the first time in their life.&nbsp;</p><p>There were future college athletes and kids with autism. There were rugby fans from New Zealand (riffing off their national team, they called themselves the "All Stacks") and South Koreans who had never been to the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>Roll your eyes, but my dad loved to say that the sport only helped build "positive pyramids." Spend a few hours watching kids pat each other on the back after a fumbled cup, or earn a hug for achieving a new personal best, and you'd buy into the platitude too.</p><p>Compared to other top-level stackers, Nedrow and Ferguson's experiences only differ in one way.&nbsp;</p><p>You've probably heard Rachael's voice. Her effusive reaction on a stacking YouTube video meant for her small group of friends is behind the iconic "YES, OH MY GOSH!" scream, sampled in one of EDM's most mainstream hits, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSeNSzJ2-Jw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites</a>," by Skrillex. Between Spotify and YouTube, it has more than 500 million streams.</p><p>And you probably know Ferguson's dad, Craig, the comedian and host of <em>The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson</em> from 2005 to 2014.</p><p>Nedrow's collision with virality gave her backstage passes to several Skrillex concerts and the greatest fodder for "Two Truths and a Lie" of all time. But sport stacking also gave her something else she wasn’t expecting: a wide group of online friends.</p><p>"I don't think I would have taken stacking so far if it wasn't for the online community," Nedrow said. "When you are doing anything kind of competitive, it seems like it's much better when you are doing it with people. I really loved the aspect of kids commenting on my videos, saying they started stacking because of me. What greater pleasure can you get than inspiring other people to do what you love the most?"</p><p>Sport stacking gave Ferguson inclusion and validation. But perhaps more important than what it gave them is what it gave their parents. While Craig and his ex-wife Sascha had been separated for a few years by the time their kid started competing, both fully committed to supporting this weird, wholesome obsession. Sascha helped Milo learn how to breathe and center themselves before starting to stack. And she supplied an ever-growing collection of stacking equipment, stored in a dedicated room in their Southern California home.</p><p>To see what sport stacking gave Craig, you need to watch his show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Wjk0PkpWco" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from April 20, 2009</a>. He spends four minutes—more than half of the entire monologue—bragging about Milo. Beneath the scripted jokes and of-the-era references (Octomom is mentioned twice), you see a guy just genuinely proud of his kid. He's like any neighbor, going off a bit too effusively about the weekend's peewee football game or math test.&nbsp;</p><p>Except this was done for millions. And it was about ... cups.&nbsp;</p><hr><div><figure><img src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/divider.png?w=710" alt="Three speed stacking cups in a row"></figure><div><blockquote><p><strong><em>"I wanted to give kids, no matter their athletic ability, the opportunity for success.

It brought kids around the world together."</em></strong></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div></div><hr><p>Sport stacking gave different things to a lot of people.</p><p>For a few, it genuinely improved their life. College funds were paid through YouTube viewership revenue and small brand endorsements. Children with autism and special needs learned, practiced, competed, and socialized with others for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>For me and my siblings, it gave us a stable home, trips to a dozen countries, and some excellent college essay material. My sister, Emmy, went on to play basketball for four years at the University of Minnesota, was drafted into the WNBA by the Minnesota Lynx, and then played professionally overseas with Sheryl Swoopes. My brother Brennan played D-III college football and turned into a mechanical engineer at a global cosmetics company. I turned into a fairly unathletic writer.</p><figure><img alt="The Fox family" src="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/unnamed-4.jpg?w=240" srcset="https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/unnamed-4.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/unnamed-4.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/unnamed-4.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/unnamed-4.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/unnamed-4.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/02/unnamed-4.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption><span>The Fox family</span><span></span><span>Kit Fox/Defector</span></figcaption></figure><p>For my parents, it gave them an early retirement. A sometimes-operational 1957 VW Bug and an obsession with growing ever-larger pumpkins occupied my dad, while training to run another marathon at age 70 became a focus for my mom. They left their active roles at Speed Stacks in 2015, leaving control to some of its earliest employees. Programs are still active in thousands of schools around the world.</p><p>"I was motivated to spread sport stacking for the same reason I taught my students how to juggle or unicycle," my dad recalled, nearly 10 years into retirement. "I wanted to give kids, no matter their athletic ability, the opportunity for success. It gave them something new and different. And it created a community. It brought kids around the world together. And believe it or not, that all happened because of a couple million plastic cups."</p><p>For some of you reading this, sport stacking gave you an identical memory.&nbsp;A cross-legged seat on a linoleum gym floor. The hush from the principal. The music crescendoing into <em>Jock Jams</em>' most iconic synth riff. The sound of cups, stacking at lightning speed. You knew, in that moment, that you weren't in for another monotonous few hours at school. Your day was about to rock.&nbsp;</p><p>For that, you can thank my dad.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></description>

          <p>We’re building a public cloud, on hardware we own. We raised money to do that, and to place some bets; one of them: GPU-enabling our customers. A progress report: GPUs aren’t going anywhere, but: GPUs aren’t going anywhere.</p>
<p>A couple years back, <a href="https://fly.io/gpu">we put a bunch of chips down</a> on the bet that people shipping apps to users on the Internet would want GPUs, so they could do AI/ML inference tasks. To make that happen, we created <a href="https://fly.io/docs/gpus/getting-started-gpus/">Fly GPU Machines</a>.</p>

<p>A Fly Machine is a <a href="https://fly.io/blog/docker-without-docker/">Docker/OCI container</a> running inside a hardware-virtualized virtual machine somewhere on our global fleet of bare-metal worker servers. A GPU Machine is a Fly Machine with a hardware-mapped Nvidia GPU. It’s a Fly Machine that can do fast CUDA.</p>

<p>Like everybody else in our industry, we were right about the importance of AI/ML. If anything, we underestimated its importance. But the product we came up with probably doesn’t fit the moment. It’s a bet that doesn’t feel like it’s paying off.</p>

<p><strong>If you’re using Fly GPU Machines, don’t freak out; we’re not getting rid of them.</strong> But if you’re waiting for us to do something bigger with them, a v2 of the product, you’ll probably be waiting awhile.</p>
<h3 id="what-it-took"><a href="#what-it-took" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>What It Took</span></h3>
<p>GPU Machines were not a small project for us. Fly Machines run on an idiosyncratically small hypervisor (normally Firecracker, but for GPU Machines <a href="https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor">Intel’s Cloud Hypervisor</a>, a very similar Rust codebase that supports PCI passthrough). The Nvidia ecosystem is not geared to supporting micro-VM hypervisors.</p>

<p>GPUs <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/09/attacking-qualcomm-adreno-gpu.html">terrified our security team</a>. A GPU is just about the worst case hardware peripheral: intense multi-directional direct memory transfers</p>
<p>(not even bidirectional: in common configurations, GPUs talk to each other)</p>
<p>with arbitrary, end-user controlled computation, all operating outside our normal security boundary.</p>

<p>We did a couple expensive things to mitigate the risk. We shipped GPUs on dedicated server hardware, so that GPU- and non-GPU workloads weren’t mixed. Because of that, the only reason for a Fly Machine to be scheduled on a GPU machine was that it needed a PCI BDF for an Nvidia GPU, and there’s a limited number of those available on any box. Those GPU servers were drastically less utilized and thus less cost-effective than our ordinary servers.</p>

<p>We funded two very large security assessments, from <a href="https://www.atredis.com/">Atredis</a> and <a href="https://tetrelsec.com/">Tetrel</a>, to evaluate our GPU deployment. Matt Braun is writing up those assessments now. They were not cheap, and they took time.</p>

<p>Security wasn’t directly the biggest cost we had to deal with, but it was an indirect cause for a subtle reason.</p>

<p>We could have shipped GPUs very quickly by doing what Nvidia recommended: standing up a standard K8s cluster to schedule GPU jobs on. Had we taken that path, and let our GPU users share a single Linux kernel, we’d have been on Nvidia’s driver happy-path.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we could have used a conventional hypervisor. Nvidia suggested VMware (heh). But they could have gotten things working had we used QEMU. We like QEMU fine, and could have talked ourselves into a security story for it, but the whole point of Fly Machines is that they take milliseconds to start. We could not have offered our desired Developer Experience on the Nvidia happy-path.</p>

<p>Instead, we burned months trying (and ultimately failing) to get Nvidia’s host drivers working to map <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/virtual-solutions/">virtualized GPUs</a> into Intel Cloud Hypervisor. At one point, we hex-edited the closed-source drivers to trick them into thinking our hypervisor was QEMU.</p>

<p>I’m not sure any of this really mattered in the end. There’s a segment of the market we weren’t ever really able to explore because Nvidia’s driver support kept us from thin-slicing GPUs. We’d have been able to put together a really cheap offering for developers if we hadn’t run up against that, and developers love “cheap”, but I can’t prove that those customers are real.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we’re committed to delivering the Fly Machine DX for GPU workloads. Beyond the PCI/IOMMU drama, just getting an entire hardware GPU working in a Fly Machine was a lift. We needed Fly Machines that would come up with the right Nvidia drivers; our stack was built assuming that the customer’s OCI container almost entirely defined the root filesystem for a Machine. We had to engineer around that in our <code>flyd</code> orchestrator. And almost everything people want to do with GPUs involves efficiently grabbing huge files full of model weights. Also annoying!</p>

<p>And, of course, we bought GPUs. A lot of GPUs. Expensive GPUs.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-isnt-working"><a href="#why-it-isnt-working" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Why It Isn’t Working</span></h3>
<p>The biggest problem: developers don’t want GPUs. They don’t even want AI/ML models. They want LLMs. <em>System engineers</em> may have smart, fussy opinions on how to get their models loaded with CUDA, and what the best GPU is. But <em>software developers</em> don’t care about any of that. When a software developer shipping an app comes looking for a way for their app to deliver prompts to an LLM, you can’t just give them a GPU.</p>

<p>For those developers, who probably make up most of the market, it doesn’t seem plausible for an insurgent public cloud to compete with OpenAI and Anthropic. Their APIs are fast enough, and developers thinking about performance in terms of “tokens per second” aren’t counting milliseconds.</p>
<p>(you should all feel sympathy for us)</p>
<p>This makes us sad because we really like the point in the solution space we found. Developers shipping apps on Amazon will outsource to other public clouds to get cost-effective access to GPUs. But then they’ll faceplant trying to handle data and model weights, backhauling gigabytes (at significant expense) from S3. We have app servers, GPUs, and object storage all under the same top-of-rack switch. But inference latency just doesn’t seem to matter yet, so the market doesn’t care.</p>

<p>Past that, and just considering the system engineers who do care about GPUs rather than LLMs: the hardware product/market fit here is really rough.</p>

<p>People doing serious AI work want galactically huge amounts of GPU compute. A whole enterprise A100 is a compromise position for them; they want an SXM cluster of H100s.</p>
<p>Near as we can tell, MIG gives you a UUID to talk to the host driver, not a PCI device.</p>
<p>We think there’s probably a market for users doing lightweight ML work getting tiny GPUs. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/technologies/multi-instance-gpu/">This is what Nvidia MIG does</a>, slicing a big GPU into arbitrarily small virtual GPUs. But for fully-virtualized workloads, it’s not baked; we can’t use it. And I’m not sure how many of those customers there are, or whether we’d get the density of customers per server that we need.</p>

<p><a href="https://fly.io/blog/cutting-prices-for-l40s-gpus-in-half">That leaves the L40S customers</a>. There are a bunch of these! We dropped L40S prices last year, not because we were sour on GPUs but because they’re the one part we have in our inventory people seem to get a lot of use out of. We’re happy with them. But they’re just another kind of compute that some apps need; they’re not a driver of our core business. They’re not the GPU bet paying off.</p>

<p>Really, all of this is just a long way of saying that for most software developers, “AI-enabling” their app is best done with API calls to things like Claude and GPT, Replicate and RunPod.</p>
<h3 id="what-did-we-learn"><a href="#what-did-we-learn" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>What Did We Learn?</span></h3>
<p>A very useful way to look at a startup is that it’s a race to learn stuff. So, what’s our report card?</p>

<p>First off, when we embarked down this path in 2022, we were (like many other companies) operating in a sort of phlogiston era of AI/ML. The industry attention to AI had not yet collapsed around a small number of foundational LLM models. We expected there to be a diversity of <em>mainstream</em> models, the world <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/bumblebee" title="">Elixir Bumblebee</a> looks forward to, where people pull different AI workloads off the shelf the same way they do Ruby gems.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://www.cursor.com/" title="">Cursor happened</a>, and, as they say, how are you going to keep ‘em down on the farm once they’ve seen Karl Hungus? It seems much clearer where things are heading.</p>

<p>GPUs were a test of a Fly.io company credo: as we think about core features, we design for 10,000 developers, not for 5-6. It took a minute, but the credo wins here: GPU workloads for the 10,001st developer are a niche thing.</p>

<p>Another way to look at a startup is as a series of bets. We put a lot of chips down here. But the buy-in for this tournament gave us a lot of chips to play with. Never making a big bet of any sort isn’t a winning strategy. I’d rather we’d flopped the nut straight, but I think going in on this hand was the right call.</p>

<p>A really important thing to keep in mind here, and something I think a lot of startup thinkers sleep on, is the extent to which this bet involved acquiring assets. Obviously, some of our <a href="https://fly.io/blog/the-exit-interview-jp/" title="">costs here aren’t recoverable</a>. But the hardware parts that aren’t generating revenue will ultimately get liquidated; like with <a href="https://fly.io/blog/32-bit-real-estate/" title="">our portfolio of IPv4 addresses</a>, I’m even more comfortable making bets backed by tradable assets with durable value.</p>

<p>In the end, I don’t think GPU Fly Machines were going to be a hit for us no matter what we did. Because of that, one thing I’m very happy about is that we didn’t compromise the rest of the product for them. Security concerns slowed us down to where we probably learned what we needed to learn a couple months later than we could have otherwise, but we’re scaling back our GPU ambitions without having sacrificed <a href="https://fly.io/blog/sandboxing-and-workload-isolation/" title="">any of our isolation story</a>, and, ironically, GPUs <em>other people run</em> are making that story a lot more important. The same thing goes for our Fly Machine developer experience.</p>

<p>We started this company building a Javascript runtime for edge computing. We learned that our customers didn’t want a new Javascript runtime; they just wanted their native code to work. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22616857" title="">We shipped containers</a>, and no convincing was needed. We were wrong about Javascript edge functions, and I think we were wrong about GPUs. That’s usually how we figure out the right answers:  by being wrong about a lot of stuff.</p>

		In 2007, on my first trip to New York City, I grabbed a brand-new DSLR camera and photographed all the fonts I was supposed to love. I admired American Typewriter in all of the I &lt;3 NYC logos, watched Akzidenz Grotesk and Helvetica fighting over the subway signs, and even caught an occasional appearance of the flawlessly-named Gotham, still a year before it skyrocketed in popularity via Barack Obama’s first campaign. 
	</p>
	<p>
		But there was one font I didn’t even notice, even though it was everywhere around me.
	</p>
	<p>		
		Last year in New York, I walked over 100 miles and took thousands of photos of one and one font only.
	</p>
	<p>		
		The font’s name is Gorton.
	</p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<h3>
		1
	</h3>
	<p>		
		It’s hard to believe today that there was a time before I knew of Gorton and all its quirks and mysteries. The first time I realized the font even existed was some time in 2017, when I was researching for <a target="_blank" href="https://shifthappens.site/">my book about the history of typing</a>. 
	</p>
	<p>		
		Many keyboards, especially older ones, sported a particular distinctive font on their keycaps. It was unusually square in proportions, and a weird mélange of “mechanical” and “childish.”
	</p>
	
	
	
	<figure>
		<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/keyboards/dsc03621.avif">
	</figure>
	

	<p>		 
		The more I looked at it, the more I realized how bizarre and amateurish it was. The G always felt like it was about to roll away on its side. There was a goofy wavy hook sticking out of Q. P and R were often too wide. &amp; and @ symbols would be laughed away in a type crit, and the endings of C felt like grabbing something next to it – a beginning of a ligature that never came.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/keyboards/dsc00642.avif">
	</figure>
	<p>		
		The strangeness extended to the digits. There was a top-flatted 3 resembling a Cyrillic letter, 7 sloping down in a unique way, a very geometric 4, an unusual – perhaps even naïve – symmetry between 6 and 9, and a conflation of O with 0 that would be a fireable offense elsewhere.
	</p>
	<p>			
		Looking at just a few keyboards, it was also obvious that it wasn’t just one rigid font. There were always variations, sometimes even on one keyboard. 0 came square, dotted, or slashed. The usually very narrow letter I sometimes sported serifs. The R and the 6 moved their middles higher or lower. There also seemed to be a narrower version of the font, deployed when a keycap needed a word and not just a letter. (Lowercase letters existed too, but not very often.) 
	</p>
	

	
	

	<p>		
		My first thought was: What a mess. Is this how “<a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.ilovetypography.com/category/grotesque">grotesque</a>” fonts got their name?
	</p>
	<p>		
		Then, the second thought: I kind of like it.
	</p>

	
	<figcaption>The most distinctive letterforms of Gorton<span> (Press a key!)</span></figcaption>
	
	
	<p>		
		But what font was it? What The Font website posited TT Rounds, Identifont suggested it could be Divulge, my early guess was DIN Rounded or something related to road signage. Whatever it was, a flat R clearly separated it from Helvetica, and the shapes were not as round as even the un-rounded Gotham’s.
	</p>
	<p>		
		A few places for keyboard nerds referred to the font as “Gorton,” but that phrase yielded zero results anywhere I typically looked for fonts I could download and install.
	</p>
	<p>				
		I originally thought this had to do with how keys were made. Only in newer keyboards are the letters printed on top of the keys, or charred from their surface by a laser. In older ones – those from the early 1960s laboratory computers, or the 1980s microcomputers –&nbsp;the way every key was constructed was by first molding the letter from plastic of one color, and then grabbing a different plastic and molding the key around the letter. A Gorton letter was as physical as the key itself. It made the keys virtually indestructible – the legend could not wear off any more than its key – and I imagined required some specialized keyboard-making machinery that came with the “keyboard font” already there.

	<p>			
		But then, I started seeing Gorton in other places.
	</p>
	<p>					
		Hours of looking at close-ups of keys made me sensitive to the peculiar shapes of some of its letters. No other font had a Q, a 9, or a C that looked like this.
	</p>
	<p>					
		One day, I saw what felt like Gorton it on a ferry traversing the waters Bay Area. A few weeks later, I spotted it on a sign in a national park. Then on an intercom. On a street lighting access cover. In an elevator. At my dentist’s office. In an alley. 
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>						
		These had one thing in common. All of the letters were carved into the respective base material – metal, plastic, wood. The removed shapes were often filled in with a different color, but sometimes left alone.
	</p>
	<p>					
		At one point someone explained to me Gorton must have been a routing font, meant to be carved out by a milling machine rather than painted on top or impressed with an inked press.
	</p>
	<p>							
		Some searches quickly led me to George Gorton Machine Co., a Wisconsin-based company which produced various engraving machines. The original model 1 led to model 1A and then 3U and then, half a decade later, P1-2. They were all pantograph engravers: They allowed you to install one or more letter templates and then trace their shape by hand. A matching rotating cutter would mimic your movements, and the specially configured arms would enlarge or reduce the output to the size you wanted.

	<figcaption>Edited from a video <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7am-ysvGD3s">Saving The Machine the World Forgot</a> with kind permission from Inheritance Machining</figcaption>
	
	
	
	<p>					
		The first font in <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/gorton-master-copy-type-for-all-pantograph-machines">the 1952’s company catalogue</a> was called Gorton Normal and I felt I already knew it by heart.
	</p>
	
	

	
	<p>							
		This immediately explained both the metaphorical and literal rough edges of Gorton.
	</p>
	<p>					
		A lot of typography has roots in calligraphy – someone holding a brush in their hand and making natural but delicate movements that result in nuanced curves filled with thoughtful interchanges between thin and thick. Most of the fonts you ever saw follow those rules; even the most “mechanical” fonts have surprising humanistic touches if you inspect them close enough.
	</p>
	<p>			
		But not Gorton. Every stroke of Gorton is exactly the same thickness (typographers would call such fonts “monoline”). Every one of its endings is exactly the same rounded point. The italic is merely an oblique, slanted without any extra consideration, and while the condensed version has some changes compared to the regular width, those changes feel almost perfunctory.
	</p>
	<p>	
		Monoline fonts are not respected highly, because every type designer will tell you: This is not how you design a font. 
	</p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<h3>

	</h3>
	
	<p>		
		It seemed at this point that perhaps P1-2 and its predecessors were a somewhat popular machining product during the 20th century’s middle decades. But casual research through materials preserved by some of George Gorton Machine Company’s fans – including <a target="_blank" href="http://gorton-machine.org/">the grandson of the founder</a> – revealed something even more interesting. Gorton the font was a lot older than I expected. 
	</p>
	<p>		
		I found a 1935 catalog showing the very same font. Then one from 1925. And then, there was one all the way from 1902, showing the shapes I was starting to be mildly obsessed with.
	</p>
	<p>			
		To put it in perspective: the font I first assumed was a peer to 1950s Helvetica was already of retirement age the day Helvetica was born. Gorton was older than Gill Sans, Futura, or Johnston’s London Underground font. It was contemporaneous to what today we recognize as the first modern sans serif font, Akzidenz-Grotesk, released but three years before the end of the century.
	</p>

	
	<figcaption>This 1902 catalogue is so old it still has <a target="_blank" hef="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_code_(communications)">telegraph codes</a></figcaption>
	
	<p>
		Imagine how stripped down and exotic Gorton must have felt right next to George Gorton Machine’s then-current logo!
	</p>
	
	<figure>
		<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/old-logo/old-logo.avif">
	</figure>

	<p>							
		<em>Now</em> I was interested. 
	</p>
	<p>					
		I started researching Gorton more. Unfortunately, as I already suspected, no one ever wrote “I used Gorton to typeset this,” because Gorton was a tenuous name at best. It was the first font, and perhaps originally the <em>only</em> font that came with the engraver, so it suffered a nameless fate, familiar later to many bespoke bitmap fonts adoring the screens of early computers.
	</p>
	<p>					
		The difference from these fonts, however, was that Gorton was meant to travel. And so, since searching for it by name was impossible, for months and years I just kept looking around for the now-familiar shapes.
	</p>
	<p>			
		And I found… a lot. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Gorton wasn’t just on computer keyboards, intercom placards, and sidewalk messages visited by many shoes. Gorton was there on typewriter keyboards, too. And on office signs and airline name tags. On boats, desk placards, rulers, and various home devices from fridges to tape dispensers.
	</p>
	<p>					
		It was also asked to help in situations other fonts rarely did. I spotted Gorton on overengineered buttons that were put to heavy industrial and military use. I saw it carved into surfaces of traffic control devices, elevators and escalators, locomotives and subway trains, submarines and jet fighters. Gorton made its way to peace- and wartime nuclear facilities, it was there on the elevator at the Kennedy Space Center with labels marked EARTH and SPACE… and it went <em>to actual space,</em> and then the Moon, as key legends on Apollo’s onboard computer.
	</p>
	
	
	
		

	
	<p>							
		But why? Why would anyone choose this kind of an ugly font where so many nicer fonts have already been around for ages?
	</p>
	<p>					
		Some of it might be the power of the default. Popular engraving equipment comes with a built-in font that’s so standard it reuses the router’s name? Of course you will see it, the same way you saw a lot of Arial in the 1990s, or Calibri today.
	</p>
	<figure>

	</figure>
	<figcaption>An example of a typical range of reducations. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gorton-machine.org/links/prayer.html">More range was available when needed</a></figcaption>

	<p>
		Gorton was also convenient. If your previous engraving work required you do to the routing equivalent of handwriting or lettering – every letter done by hand – then a modern font you could simply <em>copy,</em> and one designed with “a minimum of sharp corners for rapid tracing with a smooth stroke,” must have felt like a breath of fresh air.
	</p>
	
	<p>							
		But why engraving to begin with? Because the affordable and casual printing options we enjoy today – the office laser printers and home inkjets, the FedEx Kinko’s, the various cheap labelers – weren’t there. Even things that today feel obsolete, like dot matrix printers, Letraset, and popular letter stencils, were yet to be invented. Often, your only realistic option was the complicated and time-consuming lettering by hand.
	</p>
	<p>			
		On top of that, Gorton’s longevity must have felt attractive. Ink smudges. Paint fades away. Paper can catch fire (quickly) or germs (slowly). Carve something into plastic, on the other hand, and it can survive decades. Substitute plastic for metal, and you just turned decades into centuries. The text is not added atop heavy-duty material. The text <em>is</em> the material.

	<p>					
		I felt good about all my findings: What a strange story of a strange routing font! 
	</p>
	<p>
		But it turns out I was just getting started. Because soon, I noticed Gorton as ink on paper, and as paint on metal.
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>We’re used to the flexibility of fonts today. Fonts as bits inside a computer can become a website, paint on paper, CNC routing, a wall projection, and many other things. But those freedoms weren’t as easy back when fonts were made out of metal. Life’s not as much fun outside of the glamor of a TTF file, and a routing font couldn’t immediately become a regular font – so seeing Gorton being additive and not subtractive was an unexpected discovery.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<video muted="" loop="" playsinline="" src="https://aresluna.org/videos/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/leroy-edgar.mp4"></video>
	</figure>
	<figcaption>A Leroy lettering set in action, from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/made.by.edgar/">Made by Edgar</a></figcaption>
	<p>							
		It turns out that there developed a small cottage industry of things that extended Gorton past its engraving origins.
	</p>

	<p>							
		A company called Keuffel &amp; Esser Co. grabbed Gorton’s machines, and used them to create lettering sets called Leroy. This was Gorton abstracted away – still a pantograph, but cheap, small, completely manual, and a vastly simplified one: no possibility to make things bigger and smaller, and no carving –&nbsp;instead, you’d mount a special pen and draw letters by tracing them.
	</p>
	<p>							
		Another company, Wood-Regan Instrument Co., made a similar set called (semi-eponymously) Wrico. But then, they simplified the process even more. Instead of a pantograph, they offered for sale a set of simple lettering guides used to guide your pen directly on paper.
	</p>
	<p>							
		Some of the traditional draftspeople pooh-poohed these inventions – one handbook wrote “[Those are] of value chiefly to those who are not skilled in lettering. A professional show-card writer could work better and faster without it. A Leroy or Wrico lettering set permits work that is neat, rapid, and nearly foolproof, if not inspired.”
	</p>
	
	
	

	
	<p>			
		But the products ended up being popular and influential. Their output appeared in many technical documents, but spread even a bit further than that. Eventually, there were stencils made by Unitech, Lutz, Tacro, Teledyne Post, Tamaya, Tech Graphic, Ridgway’s, Faber Castell, Zephyr, Charvoz, Rotring, Pickett, and probably many more.
	</p>
	
		
	
	

	<p>			
		Then, both EC Comics and All-Star Comics <a target="_blank" href="https://kleinletters.com/Blog/wizards-of-leroy-and-wrico-lettering/">used Leroy in the 1940s and 1950s</a>, most notably in the first comic book that introduced Wonder Woman. This was Gorton spreading further than just technical documents, and inspiring more people.
	</p>
	
	
	

	<p>			
		Elsewhere silkscreening – a pretty cool technique of applying paint on surfaces through a wet mesh of fabric – took Gorton and Leroy in a different direction, by allowing paint on metal.
	</p>
	
	


	<p>			
		There was more. The popular plastic letters attached to fell boards, popularized by restaurants decades ago, and more recently revisited by Instagram mom influencers, also clearly derive from Gorton and Leroy.
	</p>
	
	
	

	
	<p>
		I also counted at least three different systems of “Gorton movable type” – some where you could assemble physical letters, and some where you could impress them into soft materials using steel types – and I imagine there were probably more.
	</p>
	
	
	

	
	<p>			
		Letraset, a cheap technique of applying a font by rubbing a letter from a provided sheet onto paper, popular throughout the 1960s, introduced first- or second-hand Leroy too – and so did a few competitors.
	</p>

	<p>					
		In the regulatory space, the U.S. military canonized Gorton in 1968 as a standard called MIL-SPEC-33558 for aircraft and other equipment dials, cancelled it in 1998… then brought it back again in 2007. NATO and STANAG followed. ANSI, American standardization body, made a more rounded Leroy an official font for technical lettering via <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/ansi-y14.2m-1971-line-conventions-and-lettering">ANSI Y14.2M</a>, and so did institutions like the US National Park Service.
	</p>

	

	<p>				
		Gorton went on and on and on. The early <a target="_blank" href="https://hackaday.com/2021/03/30/hershey-fonts-not-chocolate-the-origin-of-vector-lettering/">Hershey vector fonts</a>, developed on very early computers and still popular in CAD applications today, were also derived from Gorton/Leroy shapes, simplified so that the already-simple curves weren’t even necessary –&nbsp;any letter could now be drawn by a series of straight lines.
	</p>
	
	
	
	<p>					
		And even in the first universe Gorton inhabited things weren’t standing still. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		As the engraving industry learned what’s popular and what is not, the offerings started getting more and more sophisticated. A promotional booklet called “The Whereabouts of 230 Engraving Machines” listed Gorton customers ranging from biscuit makers to fire engine constructors. <a target="_blank" href="http://gorton-machine.org/forms/form_933/index.html">Other</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://gorton-machine.org/forms/form_1370a/index.html">catalogs</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://gorton-machine.org/forms/form_2070/index.html">proudly listed</a> applications like book covers, billiard balls, organ keys, and toothbrushes, as well as “tools making more tools” – using Gorton engravers to create legends for other machines.
	</p>
	<p>		
		After you bought your pantograph engraver, you could buy attachments for sometimes surprising use cases:
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	<p>
		The original machine-shop pantographs were supplanted by smaller portable units (called Pantoetchers) on one side, and by increasingly complex <em>electronic</em> devices on the other. First generation of those were still huge room-size endeavors with Nixie tubes and complex interfaces labeled… in Gorton itself. 
	</p>

	
	
	
	<p>
		But the technology matured quickly and soon more and more early manual “tracer-guided” pantographs that forced the operator to put letters side by side and then trace them by hand, were superseded by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control">computerized ones</a>, with both the composition and the routing completely automated. They came from George Gorton Machine Co., and from competitors like New Hermes or H.P. Preis.
	</p>
	<p>				
		You no longer had to buy the chromium-plated brass alphabets weighing up to 13 pounds, choosing the right size from 3/8´´ to 3´´ ahead of time (pantographs allowed for reductions and enlargements, but only gave you a few steps within a specific range.) 
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	<p>
		Now, fonts came as digits or formulas built into computer memory, or – for a moment in time –&nbsp;as separate cartridges you’d insert in eager slots. (And yes, before you ask:&nbsp;there were <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/gorton-master-copy-type-for-all-pantograph-machines/page/n5/mode/2up">other routing monoline fonts</a>, too. But I really don’t care about any of them.)
	</p>
	
	<p>					
		It was the same story as in word processing right next door, where old-fashioned Gutenberg-era typesetting was being replaced by increasingly smaller and cheaper computers equipped with first-laughable-then-capable software.
	</p>
	<p>					
		And automation came for the Leroy branch of the tree as well. A few companies grabbed Leroy lettering templates and abstracted them away once more. They created curious small typewriter/plotter hybrids where typing letters on a keyboard would make the pen draw them on paper for you. (I own one of them, a Max Cadliner. It might be one of the strangest typewriters I’ve seen – a weird combination of a machine pretending to be another machine pretending to be a human hand.)

		If this was a Gorton typewriter, there were also Gorton <em>computers</em>, even more sophisticated 1980s machines whose text could be programmed in advance rather than typed one line at a time, and mixed with graphics.

	<p>			
		I don’t think the – by now 80 years and counting – fractal explosion of Gorton made its original creators rich.
	</p>
	<p>			
		Copy protection in the world of typography is complicated. The font’s name can be trademarked and other companies legally prevented from using it, and you can’t just grab matrices or font files and copy them without appropriate licenses. But take any text output using a font and then redraw it – and you are within your right to do so, and even to sell the final result. At least in America, or in some other countries until somewhat recently, the shapes of the letters themselves are not legally protected.
	</p>
	<p>			
		This is why Keuffel &amp; Esser, Wood-Regan Instrument, and Letraset could potentially grab Gorton and claim it their own, as long as they didn’t name it Gorton. 
	</p>
	<p>							
		But of course, Gorton was barely named “Gorton” to begin with. In the early days of George Gorton pantographs, as the default pantograph font, it came without a name. (The font sets for purchase were called “standard copies.”) Then, as other fonts were added, it was retroactively named Gorton Normal – the name of the company and the most generic word possible.
	</p>
	<p>					
		Leroy lettering sets started with one font, so similarly to Gorton the font started to be known as “Leroy,” then “Series C,” then “Gothic.” New Hermes called it simply “Block,” Letraset went with “Engineering Standard,” and Rotring – another producer of little computerized plotters&nbsp;– with “Universal.” I’ve also seen “A style,” “Plain Gothic,” and, mysteriously, “Standpoint.” 
	</p>
	<p>							
		I don’t think this was meant to be disrespectful. “Standard,“ “Universal,” “A style” might not have had the connotations of “generic” we associate with them today, but rather meaning “the only one you need,” “approved of by millions,” or “the ultimate.”
	</p>
	<p>							
		But there <em>was</em> one name that felt somewhat inconsiderate. It appeared in one product in the 1980s, a few decades after the birth of another font whose name became recognizable and distinguished. In that product, Gorton was referred to as “Linetica.”

	<p>						
		Each of these reappearances made small changes to the shapes of some letters. Leroy’s ampersand was a departure from Gorton’s. Others softened the middle of the digit 3, and Wrico got rid of its distinctive shape altogether. Sometimes the tail of the Q got straightened, the other times K cleaned up. Punctuation –&nbsp;commas, quotes, question marks –&nbsp;was almost always redone. But even without hunting down the proof confirming the purchase of a Gorton’s pantograph or a Leroy template set as a starting point, the lineage of its lines was obvious. (The remixes riffed off of Gorton Condensed or the normal, squareish edition… and at times both. The extended version – not that popular to begin with – was often skipped.)
	</p>

	
	<figcaption>Classic Gorton vs. Gorton Modified</figcaption>
		

	<p>						
		The only “official” update to Gorton I know of, and one actually graced with a name, was Gorton Modified. It was made some time in the 1970s by one of the main keyboard keycap manufacturers, Comptec (later Signature Plastics). It was almost a fusion of Gorton and Futura, with more rounded letterforms. Gone was the quirkiness of 3, 7, Q, C, and the strange, tired ampersand. This is the version people might recognize from some of the 1980s computers, or mechanical keyboards today. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		It is also that last Gorton that mattered.

	<p>					
		By the time I learned about this, seven years in, I’ve become truly obsessed with Gorton and made it public by <a target="_blank" href="https://newsletter.shifthappens.site/archive/a-tale-of-three-skeuomorphs/">writing about it in my newsletter</a>. 
	</p>
	<p>							
		My every walk in Chicago or San Francisco was counting down “time to Gorton” – sometimes mere minutes before I saw a placard or an intercom with the familiar font.
	</p>
	<p>							
		This might be embarrassing to admit, but I have never been so happy seeing a font in the wild, particularly as there was almost always some new surprise – a numero, a line going through the Z, a new use, or a new imperfection. And, for a font that didn’t exist, I saw it surprisingly often.
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	

	
	<p>									
		I even spotted Gorton a few times in Spain, or the U.K., and didn’t make too much of it, not thinking about the likelihood of machines from George Gorton’s company in a small town of Racine, Wisconsin making it all the way to different continents. In hindsight I should have.
	</p>

	
	<figcaption>Gorton on old British cars, with a particularly delightful Rolls Royce logo made by a simple duplication of the classic Gorton letter R</figcaption>


	<p>						
		It was only on a trip to Australia where something started connecting. Here, once more, I saw Gorton on the streets, put to work in all sorts of unglamorous situations:
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>							
		Some letterforms in the above photos felt slightly odd, and so did Gorton on the heavy machinery in an abandoned shipyard on an island near Sydney:
	</p>

	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>							
		And a visit to a naval museum cemented it all:
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

	
	
		
	
	<p>
		It was Gorton, although with some consistent quirks: 2, 5, 6, and 9 were shorter, the centers of M and W didn’t stretch all the way across, and the distinctive shape of S was slightly different here.
	</p>
	<p>							
		What on literal earth! 
	</p>
	<p>							
		Fortunately, this time around, a type designer familiar with my now-public obsession with Gorton clued me in. Gorton didn’t actually originate from Racine, Wisconsin in the late 19th century. It started a bit earlier, and quite a bit further away, at a photographic lens maker in the U.K. called Taylor, Taylor &amp; Hobson. 
	</p>
	<p>							
		In 1894, TT&amp;H needed some way to put markings on their lenses. This being late 19th century, their options were limited to manual engraving, which must have felt tricky given the small font sizes necessary. So the company did what makers sometimes do – instead of searching for a solution that might not have even existed, they made new types of machines to carve out letters, and then designed a font to be used with them.
	</p>

	
	<figure>
		<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/lenses/img02330.avif">
	</figure>
	
	
	<p>
		I don’t know how this first proto-Gorton was designed – unfortunately, Taylor, Taylor &amp; Hobson’s history seems sparse and despite personal travels to U.K. archives, I haven’t found anything interesting – but I know simple technical writing standards existed already, and likely influenced the appearance of the newfangled routing font.

	<figcaption>From a 1895 “Free-hand lettering” book by Frank T. Daniels</figcaption>

	<p>					
		This was perhaps the first modern pantograph engraver, and perhaps even the arrival of a concept of an engraving font – the first time technical writing was able to be replicated consistently via the aid of the machine.
	</p>

	
	

	<p>			
		No wonder that other companies came knocking. Only a few years later, still deep within the 19th century, Taylor, Taylor &amp; Hobson <a target="_blank" href="http://gorton-machine.org/archives/TTH_license_1898/index.html">licensed their stuff to a fledgling American company</a> named after its founder. Gorton Model 1 was the first U.S. version of the engraver, and the TT&amp;H font must have been slightly adjusted on arrival.

	<p>			
		This adds to the accomplishments of Gorton – the font was actually <em>older</em> than even Akzidenz-Grotesk, and has been used on World War II equipment and later on on British rifles and motorcycles (and 3,775 finger posts in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/behind-the-signs-the-man-and-the-machine/">one of the UK’s national parks</a>), but it complicates the story of the name even more. Turns out, the font without a name has even less of a name than I suspected.
	</p>
	<p>			
		If the Taylor, Taylor &amp; Hobson (or, Taylor-Hobson, as their engravers were known) “branch” of Gorton were more used, should it usurp the at least somewhat popular Gorton name? Or should it just because it was first and the letterform changes were small? Does it matter? Where does one font end and another begin? (Unsurprisingly, TT&amp;H didn’t properly name the font either, eventually calling it “A style” for regular and “C style” for condensed variants. Google searches for “taylor hobson font” are a lot more sparse than those for Gorton.)

		In the end, I’m sticking with Gorton for the whole branch since that feels the most well-known name, but I feel ill-equipped to make that call for everyone. You might choose to call it Gorton, Leroy, TT&amp;H, Taylor-Hobson, or one of the many other names. (Just, ideally, not Linetica.)

	<p>					
		And so, throughout the 20th century, Gorton has lived two parallel lives –&nbsp;one originating in the U.K. and later expanding to its colonies and the rest of Europe, and another one in America. 
	</p>
	<p>							
		I am still tracing various appearences of Gorton and perhaps you, dear reader, will help me with that. (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion">Chances are</a>, you will see Gorton later today!) I’m curious about whether Gorton made it to Eastern Europe, Africa, or Asia. I’m interested in seeing if it appeared in Germany where the objectively better-designed DIN fonts became much more popular in Gorton’s niche.
	</p>

	
			
	

			
	

	
	<p>
		The history of this strange font spans over a century and I’ve seen it in so many countries by now, used in so many situations. But it’s impossible for me to say Gorton is the most hard-working font in the world.
	</p>
	<p>							
		To this title, there are many contenders. Garamond has a head start of 300+ years and has been released in more versions than letters in any alphabet. Helvetica is so famous and used so much that even its ugly copy, Arial, became a household name. Whatever font MS Office or a popular operating system appoint to be “the default” – from Times New Roman through Calibri to Roboto – immediately enjoys the world premiere that any Hollywood movie would be envious of. There is even a 5×7 pixel font originally started by Hitachi that you can see everywhere on cheap electronic displays in cash registers and intercoms.
	</p>
	<p>							
		But there is one place in the world where Gorton pulls triple duty, and I feel confident in saying at least this: Gorton is the hardest working font in Manhattan.
	</p>
	<p>						
		In 2007, on my first trip to New York City, I grabbed my brand-new DSLR camera and photographed all the fonts I was supposed to love: American Typewriter, Helvetica, Gotham. But, in hindsight, I missed the most obvious one.
	</p>
	<p>							
		Gorton is everywhere in Manhattan. It’s there in the elevators, in the subway, on ambulances, in various plaques outside and inside buildings. And god knows it’s there on so, so many intercoms.
	</p>

	
	
	
	

	<p>					
		I wouldn’t be surprised if there weren’t a single block without any Gorton in a whole of Manhattan.
	</p>

	
	<figcaption>A complete inventory of Gorton outside, near my hotel, between 5th and 7th avenues and 25th and 35th streets. I didn’t have access to the interiors of most buildings.</figcaption>

	<p>	
		The omnipresence of Gorton makes it easy to collect all the type crimes layered on top of the font’s already dubious typographical origins. Walking through Manhattan, you can spot the abominable lowercase that should better be forgotten:
	</p>
	
	

	

	
	<p>							
		You can see all sorts of kerning mistakes:
	</p>


	
	
	
	
	<p>									
		You will notice the many, many routing imperfections – an unfinished stroke, a shaky hand, or services of a pantograph that never felt the loving touch of regular maintenance:
	</p>

	
		
	
	
	<p>
		There are all the strange decisions to haphazardly mix various styles of Gorton, or even to mix Gorton with other fonts:
	</p>
	
	
	
		
	
	<p>											
		You can even spot reappearing strange characters like a weirdly deep 3, or a flattened 4:
	</p>

	
	
		
  <p>
    I wish I understood how they came to be, but I have a hunch. The nature of pantographic reproduction is that Gorton carved into metal is not that far away from the original Gorton font template you started with! So in addition to the George Gorton and Taylor Hobson originals, and the other named and above-the-table copies, they might have been bigger or smaller Gorton <em>bootlegs</em>. I have one myself, carved into acrylic, of unknown provenance and even more nameless than I thought possible for an already name-free font.
  </p>
    
	<p>
		But New York Gorton holds pleasant surprises, too. Despite the simplicity of Gorton itself, the combinations of font sizes, cutter sizes, materials, reproductions, and applications can still yield some striking effects:

		This was what made me walk 100 miles. Over and over again, Gorton found ways to make itself interesting. Without hyperbole, I consider the above photos simply beautiful.
	
	

	<p>
		In a city that never sleeps, Gorton wasn’t allowed to sleep, either. Even in the richest and most glamorous neighborhoods of Manhattan, the font would be there, doing the devil’s work without complaining. Gorton made Gotham feel bougie; American Typewriter touristy.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		And once in a while, I’d find Gorton that would wink at me with a story –&nbsp;followed by that aching in the heart as I realized I’d never know what the story was.

		You’re not supposed to fall in love with an ugly font. No one collects specimens of Arial. No one gets into eBay fights for artifacts set in Papyrus. No one walks a hundred miles in a hot New York summer, sweating beyond imagination, getting shouted at by security guys, to capture photos of Comic Sans.
	</p>
	<p>							
		So why do I love Gorton so much? 
	</p>
	<p>							
		The Occam’s Razor seems sharp on this one. Perhaps I like it because I’m a boy and Gorton is often attached to heavy machinery. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Or perhaps I have a strange affection to quirky hard-working fonts created by people who did not come from the world of type: the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Subway_(typeface)">Toronto Subway font</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/collections/stories/people/edward-johnston-man-behind-londons-lettering">London Underground font</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Modern">Computer Modern</a>. 	(This essay is typeset in a strangely-spaced version of Century put together for <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/ibm-selectric-composer-type-style-portfolio/page/18/mode/2up">Selectric Composer typewriters</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kutilek.de/selectric/">recreated for on-screen use</a>. If that didn’t bother you before, it will bother you through the rest of this article.)
	</p>
	<p>				
		But there must be more to it. Perhaps it’s all about the strange contrasts Gorton represents. The font is so ubiquitous, but also profoundly unrecognizable, sporting no designer and no name. Gorton is a decidedly toy-like, amateurish font deployed to for some of the most challenging type jobs: nuclear reactors, power plants, spacecraft. More than most other fonts, Gorton feels it’s been made by machines for machines –&nbsp;but in its use, it’s also the font that allows you to see so many human mistakes and imperfections.
	</p>
	<p>				
		Gorton also feels mistake-friendly. The strange limitations of Gorton mean that some of the transgressions of other fonts don’t apply here. The monoline nature of the font means that messing with the size of Gorton is okay: Shrinking the font for small caps or superscript, for example, gives you still-valid letterforms, almost by accident. 
	</p>

	
	
	<p>
		Stretching or slanting Gorton is not as much a typographical crime as it would be with other fonts because you don’t stretch the tip of the router itself.
	</p>
	
	

	
	<p>							
		There are genuinely moments where I felt Gorton gave people freedoms to maul it decades before variable fonts allowed us similar flexibiity.
		And on top of that, the simplicity of the letterforms themselves feels compatible with the typical naïveté of Gorton’s typesetting. 
	</p>

	<figcaption>Various accessories and attachments allowing you to shift Gorton around in a way other fonts would not allow</figcaption>
	
	<p>
    Sure, there are really bad renditions that are inexcusable. 

		But most of the time, the imperfections and bad decisions are what makes Gorton come alive. They don’t feel like a profound misunderstandings of typography, typesetting, or Gorton itself. They don’t feel like abuses or aberrations. No, they feel exactly how Gorton was supposed to be used – haphazardly, without much care, to solve a problem and walk away. (Later routing fonts copied Helvetica, but seeing Helvetica in this context with all the same mistakes grates so much more.)
	</p>

	<p>			
		The transgressions are not really transgressions. They all feel honest. The font and its siblings just show up to work without pretense, without ego, without even sporting a nametag. Gorton isn’t meant to be admired, celebrated, treasured. It’s meant to do some hard work and never take credit for it. Gorton feels like it was always a font, and never a typeface. (Depending on how rigid you are with your definitions, some versions of Gorton – especially those without instructions on how letters are positioned against each other – might not even <a target="_blank" href="https://mastodon.design/@fhardwig@mastodon.social/113515144112560218">classify as a font</a>!)
	</p>
		
	<p>					
		And I think I love Gorton because over the years I grew a little tired of the ultra flat displays rendering miniature pixels with immaculate precision. 	
		With Gorton, carving into metal or plastic means good-looking fixes are impossible:
	</p>
	
	
	

	<p>
		And unsurprising given its roots, Gorton has dimensionality that most fonts cannot ever enjoy: A routing tip picked in the 1980s and a sun coming in from just the right angle forty years later can create a moment that thousands of letterpress cards can only dream of.
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>
		Perhaps above everything else, Gorton is all about <em>texture</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Every kind of engraving has it, of course. But these are not precise submillimeter letters at the bottom of your MacBook Pro or Apple Watch. This is the utilitarian, often harried, sometimes downright <em>careless</em> Gorton, carved into steel of a  
		mid-century intercom and filled in with <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/llzdLgMurvw?si=8S7px9gg8iH4iav2&amp;t=101">special paste or wax</a>, or put on an office placard made out of a special two-layer material made especially so engraving it reveals the second color underneath, without the need for infill. 
	</p>

	
	
	
	
	
	<p>			
		(This is also true when it comes to the original reason I learned of Gorton. Letters on keycaps show the same artifacts – you just have to look very, very closely.)
	</p>

		<img src="https://aresluna.org/images/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/keycap-engraving/cropped.avif">
	</figure>
	
	<p>
		That’s the last, and perhaps the best thing to fall in love with. 
	</p>
		
	<p>
		You won’t be able to fully appreciate it here, of course, but maybe this will give an approximation of how beautiful Gorton’s non-beauty can be:

		This has been a strange thing to write. Gorton has been around for over 135 years and used in so many countries for so many reasons, and yet I found no single article about it. 
	</p>
	<p>					
		I feel the burden of being an amateur historian, wanting to know and share so much more, but only being able to provide little. I don’t know the full extent of Gorton’s use. I don’t know who designed it. My chronology is rickety and pieced together from a few breadcrumbs. I dream of seeing the original drawings or drafts once laid on the tables of Taylor, Taylor &amp; Hobson offices, or some notes, or some correspondence. I fear they might no longer exist.

	<p>					
		Also, if part of the allure of Gorton is shying away from the limelight and not being admired, am I doing it a disservice by writing about it?
	</p>
	<p>					
		But mostly, I can’t shake the feeling that we all missed a window. That this essay can’t be just a celebration, but also needs to be the beginnings of a eulogy.

	<p>					
		Walking around New York, you get a sense that even Gorton carved into metal can disappear. Some of the signs are rusted or destroyed beyond repair. Others get replaced by more modern, charmless equivalents.
	</p>
	<p>							
		Gorton itself is obsolete. All <a target="_blank" href="https://spkeyboards.com/">the keyboards that use Gorton Modified</a> you can still buy new today are tipping a hat to nostalgia. The omnipresence of Gorton in New York City is already time shifted from its decades of glory, a simple confirmation of what Robert Moses knew so well: that once built, cities don’t change all that much. But few of the new placards use Gorton, and none of the new intercoms do. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Taylor, Taylor &amp; Hobson went through multiple splits and mergers and survives as a subsidiary of Ametek, chiefly working on measuring devices. George Gorton Machine Co. from Racine has been bought by Kearny &amp; Trecker, which became Cross &amp; Trecker, was acquired by Giddings &amp; Lewis, and then acquired <em>again</em> by ThyssenKrupp, but not before the Gorton branch was spun off as Lars, and in a sequence of events now resembling a telenovella, eventually bought by Famco in 1987. I do not believe any corporate grandchildren of TT&amp;H and George Gorton’s company are today selling Gorton in any capacity.
	</p>
	<p>							
		It will take decades, perhaps even centuries, but one day the last of this font will be gone. The modern recreations (<a target="_blank" href="https://aresluna.org/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/recreations">I eventually found quite a few</a>) won’t help. They are perhaps all missing a point, anyway.
	</p>

	<p>
		But there’s a somewhat silver lining. Yes, when Gorton is carved into fresh metal, there might be nothing more pretty than seeing its depths glistening in the sun.
	</p>
	
	
	

	
	<p>
		But fresh, shining metal is at this point rare. Fortunately, the Gorton I love most is the weathered Gorton.
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	<p>							
		Manhattan’s tired Gorton is the best variant of Gorton: infill cracked by hot summers followed by frigid winters, the surface scratched by keys or worn out by many finger presses, the routing snafus meeting decades of wear and tear. Gorton’s no stranger to water, snow, rust, or dirt.
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>		
		This is, perhaps, how you become gortonpilled. You learn to recognize the 7 with a crooked hook, the Q with a swung dash, the strange top-heavy 3, the simple R. You start noticing the endings of each character being consistently circular, rather than occasionally flat. A routing mistake, suspicious kerning, or the absence of lowercase are not a wrongdoing – they’re a <em>confirmation</em>.
	</p>
	
		
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>							
		You find yourself enchanted with how this simple font went so very far. And then you touch the letters, just to be sure. If you can <em>feel</em> them, chances are this is Gorton.

parallelism. However, Transformers are computationally expensive at inference
time, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings (e.g., mobile
and embedded devices). Addressing this, we (1) begin by showing that attention
can be viewed as a special Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the ability to
compute its many-to-one RNN output efficiently. We then (2) show that popular
attention-based models such as Transformers can be viewed as RNN variants.
However, unlike traditional RNNs (e.g., LSTMs), these models cannot be updated
efficiently with new tokens, an important property in sequence modelling. Tackling
this, we (3) introduce a new efficient method of computing attention’s many-tomany RNN output based on the parallel prefix scan algorithm. Building on the
new attention formulation, we (4) introduce Aaren, an attention-based module that
can not only (i) be trained in parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be updated
efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like
traditional RNNs). Empirically, we show Aarens achieve comparable performance
to Transformers on 38 datasets spread across four popular sequential problem
settings: reinforcement learning, event forecasting, time series classification, and
time series forecasting tasks while being more time and memory-efficient.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>It's true that Tsetlin Machines are currently a fringe area of ML research, especially compared to the focus on deep learning advancements coming out of SF and China. It's early days, but the energy efficiency potential is insane. I believe further investment could yield significant results. Having been supervised by the creator, I'm admittedly biased, but the underlying foundation in Tsetlin's learning automata gives it a solid theoretical grounding. Dedicated funding is definitely needed to explore its full potential.</p>

Although they eventually restored my account, this time the process took 4–5 days, which caused me to miss an interview.</p><p>5) Now my profile is accessible via direct link, but I’ve disappeared from search. No one can find me, and hardly anyone visits my page. My post was hidden while support was "sorting out" my account, and I lost all the potential post views it would have gained because it wasn't featured in the recommendations.</p><p>All of this happened within the first three months of using LinkedIn. I’ve never seen a more appalling social media, one so full of dark patterns and outright abuse towards its users, forcing them through humiliating identity verification processes and hiding them from search.</p><p>Needless to say, I have never violated any of the platform’s rules. I don’t spam, I don’t bother people, and I don’t advertise anything. Meanwhile, my friend, whose account is over five years old—can do whatever he wants. He uses VPNs, changes his profile location several times a week, and switches his VPN location from Dubai to Europe multiple times a day without ever facing any restrictions.</p><p>And yes, I completely forgot to add: when your account gets restricted, it doesn’t matter whether you’re a premium user or not — the treatment is equally poor and the response is equally slow.</p><p>I’ve never seen a worse social media, and I’d be thrilled if a worthy competitor to LinkedIn ever emerged, I’d be one of the first to join.</p><p>BONUS: This content was originally posted on reddit, quickly became popular in the LinkedIn subreddit and was then deleted by moderator who works for M$ (which owns LinkedIn).

      <p>The official NBA Apple Vision Pro app now has Tabletop, a diorama-scale virtual representation of the live game you're watching. </p><p>Tabletop shows in addition to the 2D livestream view you see floating in front of you as a large virtual screen, giving you the benefits of both. Note that the 2D livestream view is not visible in the screen recording below, due to the DRM protection system it uses.</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://www.uploadvr.com/content/media/2025/02/NBA-Apple-Vision-Pro-Tabletop-view_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When captive loggerhead sea turtles anticipate food, they do a little dance. The turtles raise their heads out of water, open their mouths, flap their flippers and spin in circles.</p><p>Not only is this “turtle dancing behavior” cute, it was also the key to unlocking a significant scientific discovery by researchers at UNC-Chapel Hill.</p><p>The prestigious international science journal Nature published the study Feb. 12. Kayla Goforth, a recent doctoral graduate in the College of Arts and Sciences’ biology department, is the lead author of “Learned magnetic map cues and two mechanisms of magnetoreception in turtles.”</p><p>Early on in her graduate studies at Carolina, Goforth was fascinated by sea turtles returning to the same feeding sites again and again throughout their lifetimes — despite traveling up to 10,000 miles across the planet. She hypothesized that these turtles used Earth’s magnetic field to memorize specific geographic areas that they associated with food, and she devised an experiment in the biology department’s <a href="https://lohmannlab.web.unc.edu/">Lohmann Lab</a> — run by husband-and-wife duo Kenneth and Catherine Lohmann.</p><p>“Kayla began to wonder if we could get the turtles to associate the magnetic signature of a geographic area with food — and therefore act out this turtle dance behavior,” said Kenneth Lohmann, the Charles P. Postelle Jr. Distinguished Professor of Biology. “She really took the lead in this. I wasn’t at all sure in the beginning whether it would work, but we were happy to have her try, and it turned out remarkably well.”</p><div id="attachment_252848"><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-252848" src="https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Untitled-design9.gif" alt="Short, soundless video of a small sea turtle flapping around in water." width="800" height="533"></p><p id="caption-attachment-252848">The team of Carolina researchers analyzed how sea turtles use Earth’s magnetic field to guide their long-distance migrations across the ocean, and how the turtles sense magnetic fields.</p></div><p>Goforth and the rest of the all-Carolina team conditioned loggerhead turtles to magnetic fields replicating those that exist in various oceanic locations, repeatedly feeding the turtles in some magnetic fields while not feeding them in others. When later exposed to the fields in which they were fed, the turtles exhibited “turtle dancing behavior,” indicating that they associated that specific magnetic signature with food.</p><p>“That’s how we figured out what to measure, just by watching them do this as we were feeding them in the lab,” said Goforth, who is now conducting postdoctoral research at Texas A&amp;M University. “When they get really excited, they stick their heads out; they slap their flippers wildly; they spin in place sometimes.”</p><p>The assay suggests that loggerhead sea turtles can learn the magnetic signatures of geographical areas — much like dropping a pin in a GPS app.</p><div id="attachment_252840"><p><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-252840" src="https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HatchlingLoggerheadMultitudes-225x300.jpeg" alt="Aerial image of many sea turtles on a beach." width="225" height="300" srcset="https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HatchlingLoggerheadMultitudes-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HatchlingLoggerheadMultitudes-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HatchlingLoggerheadMultitudes-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HatchlingLoggerheadMultitudes-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HatchlingLoggerheadMultitudes-scaled.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-252840">The groundbreaking study was published in the prestigious international science journal Nature. (Ken Lohmann/biology department)</p></div><p>When turtles use magnetic signatures, they are using their magnetic map sense, but they also have a magnetic compass sense that enables them to move north, south or some other direction. The research further showed that the map and compass senses detect magnetic fields in different ways.</p><p>Working in collaboration with the College’s physics and astronomy department, the team investigated the effects of radiofrequency oscillating magnetic fields on the turtles’ magnetic senses. What the team found surprised them. The oscillating magnetic fields had no impact on the turtles’ magnetic map ability but did disrupt the turtles’ ability to use the magnetic compass and orient themselves.</p><p>“It suggested there are two different mechanisms for the magnetic map and compass,” Goforth said. “And they might have evolved separately.”</p><p>Exactly how turtles and other migratory species use these senses is a question that has baffled scientists for more than 50 years, and it’s one that Goforth continues to research at Texas A&amp;M, now studying monarch butterflies instead of sea turtles.</p><p>“The big question is always the mechanism,” Goforth said. “What’s the mechanism and what is the sensor? We know that for the visual sense, you have eyes; for the sense of smell, you have a nose; and for hearing, you have ears. But no receptor like that has been identified for the magnetic sense, and the mechanism remains unknown.”</p><div id="attachment_252838"><p><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-252838" src="https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TurtleEmbedFinal-1024x576.jpg" alt="Hand holding a tiny sea turtle." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TurtleEmbedFinal-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TurtleEmbedFinal-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TurtleEmbedFinal-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TurtleEmbedFinal-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TurtleEmbedFinal-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TurtleEmbedFinal-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TurtleEmbedFinal-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TurtleEmbedFinal-550x310.jpg 550w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TurtleEmbedFinal-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TurtleEmbedFinal-350x196.jpg 350w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TurtleEmbedFinal-250x141.jpg 250w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TurtleEmbedFinal-200x112.jpg 200w, https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TurtleEmbedFinal.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-252838">(Ken Lohmann/biology department)</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AI agents aren’t just indexing your content anymore. With tools like OpenAI’s Operator, Anthropic’s Computer Use API, and BrowserBase’s Open Operator, these agents can navigate the web, mimic real users, and even take actions at scale. The challenge? Knowing whether they’re enhancing your user experience—or opening the door to abuse.</p><p>In some scenarios, apps might encourage agent use if it improves usability and adoption, but in other cases, it could present unacceptable risks for application developers or be used as a method for malicious attacks (e.g. credential stuffing or fake account creation).</p><p>In either scenario, observability is paramount. Applications need to know what traffic is on their site (is this a human? A bot? A good bot or a bad one?) in order to make intelligent decisions about how to shape traffic and enforce desired usage patterns. AI agents add an additional wrinkle as users are already sharing their credentials with tools like Operator, meaning even a well-intentioned agent creates potential risk for these applications and their users.</p><p>The key question is: <strong>Can you detect AI agent traffic on your application today?</strong></p><p>We tested multiple AI agent toolkits across high-traffic consumer sites, and the results were clear—legacy detection techniques (CAPTCHAs, IP blocking, user-agent filtering) are largely ineffective. Here’s what we found.</p><h2 id="thenewrealityofbottrafficwhataiagenttrafficlookslike">The New Reality of Bot Traffic:<strong> </strong>What AI Agent Traffic Looks Like</h2><p>Traditionally, bot detection relied on CAPTCHAs, IP blocking, and user-agent filtering. But modern AI agents are engineered to look like actual users:</p><ul><li><strong>Realistic fingerprints:</strong> They use genuine IP addresses, user agents, and even simulate mouse movements.</li><li><strong>Headless browsing at human speeds:</strong> Their interactions mimic natural browsing behavior, evading rate-limit triggers.</li><li><strong>Datacenter origins—but not always:</strong> While some (like OpenAI’s Operator) come from known Azure datacenters, others (like Anthropic’s API) can run locally, borrowing your machine’s properties.</li></ul><div><figure><img alt="Reddit blocking AI agent operators." loading="lazy" width="726" height="753" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/3jwyzebk/production/e195fa64f9235588fb217cae233f3258d7ac3e9a-726x753.png?auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 1x, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/3jwyzebk/production/e195fa64f9235588fb217cae233f3258d7ac3e9a-726x753.png?auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/3jwyzebk/production/e195fa64f9235588fb217cae233f3258d7ac3e9a-726x753.png?auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>On the surface level, AI agent traffic can look quite similar to regular human user traffic.

Because these solutions originate from a cloud‑hosted environment (with IP addresses and other signatures tied to the provider’s infrastructure), they can be <strong>easier to detect</strong> via methods like ASN lookups if the provider’s IP ranges are well known.</p><p>By contrast, Anthropic’s “Computer Use” functionality is available only through its API as of now, and you can choose how to run that API (e.g., directly on your own machine vs. inside a VM or container). If you run it locally, it inherits your local system’s properties like IP and ASN; if you host it in the cloud, it uses whichever environment that provider offers. Each approach has its own implications for fingerprinting and detection.</p><p>Currently, Anthropic provides two options for using their agent:</p><ol><li>Direct use of your computer environment (not recommended due to security concerns around unrestricted access).</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/computer-use-demo">Setting up a virtual machine or container</a> with minimal privileges to run the API.

For some like Reddit &amp; Youtube, their block on OpenAI Operator indicates they want to lock down agentic traffic. When these AI Agents bypass their restrictions (as detailed below), it’s a good signal those tools are actually flying below their radar today versus being officially sanctioned.</p><p>For others that allow this traffic, they may actually encourage it for user convenience or potentially have perverse incentives in some cases to allow a certain amount of bot traffic (Ticketmaster is a potential example of this given they can benefit from some level of bot activity increasing ticket purchase rates). Many more sites, however, simply don’t have the traffic intelligence to detect these AI agents, which explains why they can operate freely.</p><p>In testing the three primary AI Agent browsing toolkits on a set of high traffic consumer sites, we found that Youtube and Reddit were the only ones that consistently blocked this traffic:</p><table><thead><tr><td></td><th><h4>OpenAI Operator</h4></th><th><h4>Anthropic Computer Use API</h4></th><th><h4>BrowserBase Open Operator</h4></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="3"><h4>Youtube</h4></td></tr><tr><td><h4>Youtube</h4></td><td><p>❌</p></td><td><p>✅</p></td><td><p>✅</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h4>Reddit</h4></td></tr><tr><td><h4>Reddit</h4></td><td><p>❌</p></td><td><p>✅</p></td><td><p>❌</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h4>LinkedIn</h4></td></tr><tr><td><h4>LinkedIn</h4></td><td><p>✅</p></td><td><p>✅</p></td><td><p>✅</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h4>Twitter/X</h4></td></tr><tr><td><h4>Twitter/X</h4></td><td><p>✅</p></td><td><p>✅</p></td><td><p>✅</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h4>Facebook.com</h4></td></tr><tr><td><h4>Facebook.com</h4></td><td><p>✅</p></td><td><p>✅</p></td><td><p>✅</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h4>OpenTable</h4></td></tr><tr><td><h4>OpenTable</h4></td><td><p>✅</p></td><td><p>✅</p></td><td><p>✅</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h4>Pinterest</h4></td></tr><tr><td><h4>Pinterest</h4></td><td><p>✅</p></td><td><p>✅</p></td><td><p>✅</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h4>Nike</h4></td></tr><tr><td><h4>Nike</h4></td><td><p>✅</p></td><td><p>✅</p></td><td><p>✅</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Few websites are blocking popular AI Agents today – indicating either a lack of detection, ambivalence towards enforcement, or both. Reddit &amp; Youtube are a couple of key outliers that block this traffic when they can discern it.</p><p>Still, the differences are interesting. It’s worth understanding why Anthropic or BrowserBase are sometimes able to bypass sites that otherwise are blocking this traffic. In BrowserBase’s case, they generate a slightly different user-agent each session, which sometimes aligns with the underlying chromium runtime but sometimes attempts to be deceptive by claiming to be a different version, which leads to more inconsistency in whether companies detect it correctly.</p><p>Companies like LinkedIn and X are particularly sensitive to scraping on their sites, so the lack of enforcement is surprising. This suggests they’re not currently able to confidently discern this is programmatic traffic.</p><h2 id="howtotellanagentfromahuman">How to Tell an Agent from a Human</h2><p>The obvious question here is: <strong>shouldn't this be easy to detect by using just an IP or user agent?</strong></p><p>And the answer is yes and no. For OpenAI Operator, it’s pretty straightforward to detect given its stability &amp; origin point. For Anthropic and BrowserBase (and the new agents entering the market), it’s a bit more complicated.</p><table><thead><tr><td></td><th><h4>OpenAI Operator</h4></th><th><h4>Anthropic Computer Use API</h4></th><th><h4>BrowserBase Open Operator</h4></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="3"><h4>Browser Stack</h4></td></tr><tr><td><h4>Browser Stack</h4></td><td><p>Chromium</p></td><td><p>Firefox</p></td><td><p>Chromium</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><h4>IP address properties</h4></td></tr><tr><td><h4>IP address properties</h4></td><td><p>Known Azure Datacenter</p></td><td><div variant="listItem"><p>Depends on how you run it:</p><ul><li>Unlike Operator, you can run it locally directly on your machine or (recommended) on a dockerized container.

And core to that is having high confidence in whether a browser interacting with your site is a real browser or a headless instrumentation.</p><p>This is where we’ve personally found Machine Learning to be incredibly useful by building a browser lie detector. We look at a very wide range of browser signals &amp; we have downloaded the entire historical archives of every browser version that has been released that we can find and trained our model on what authentic browsers look like vs. anomalous or deceitful browsers. </p><p>To provide this visibility, we’ve automated additions of new legitimate browser signatures upon new releases, we fingerprint it, run it past the model to establish an authentic set of signals for the current browser version, allowing us to detect anyone trying to emulate that version inorganically. With that fingerprinted dataset, machine learning can be used to detect anomalies with high accuracy. It’s this signal collection that has allowed us to see that OpenAI &amp; BrowserBase are full chromium builds, while Anthropic’s Firefox browser fails to emulate certain characteristics that would be present on a real user’s Firefox instance.</p><h2 id="chartingyourpathforward"><strong>Charting Your Path Forward</strong></h2><p>Whether you choose to block, restrict, or harness AI agent traffic, effective observability is non-negotiable. Here’s our current playbook:</p><ul><li><strong>Monitor actively:</strong> Start by detecting and monitoring AI agent fingerprints. Learn from their behavior before enforcing hard limits.</li><li><strong>Embrace legitimate use cases:</strong> Some users may leverage AI agents to streamline workflows (e.g., automating reporting on your dashboard). Recognize these opportunities while safeguarding against abuse.</li><li><strong>Iterate quickly:</strong> As AI agents evolve, so must your detection strategies. Invest in ML-based solutions that adapt alongside new agent behaviors.</li></ul><p>AI agents are rewriting the rules of web interaction. They offer exciting UX advancements—but also present new security challenges.

Victims of police misconduct and their families often spend years in court to seek justice only for officers to be shielded by qualified immunity, their lawyers have argued.</p><p id="PHA2JFPD5NCLFJBYDYVRAOVJFI">Dahab represents Haley Olson, who runs a marijuana dispensary store in John Day, population 1,660.</p><p id="I4PABPRW5BFMDNL6UQT7YCAMXA">Olson’s case began when she was pulled over and arrested in Jerome County, Idaho, on Jan. 22, 2019, and charged with possessing marijuana. </p><p id="A7O5LU6VJJDLHGJOBIUDS7LJXA">Recreational marijuana use is legal in Oregon but not in Idaho. </p><p id="CESXQNSFLZHDZEDRO46OBU2SHI">Olson told the Idaho State Police trooper during the stop that her boyfriend was a sheriff’s deputy and police also found a business card for Grant County sheriff’s Deputy Tyler Smith in Olson’s car, according to the appellate opinion.</p><p id="HHD76GJLI5FYLBXFK6XRF7VB7E">Olson signed a form, giving Idaho police consent to search her cellphone. They extracted and copied the contents of her phone for review. Idaho authorities later dropped charges against her.</p><p id="UYRIYSHHXVE3RFRAE7QOAMFI3M">But <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/topic/sheriff%20glenn%20palmer/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.oregonlive.com/topic/sheriff%20glenn%20palmer/">Glenn Palmer, the Grant County sheriff at the time</a>, had called the Idaho trooper who handled Olson’s case shortly after her arrest. Palmer had apparently heard about the arrest from another sheriff’s office employee and was “curious” about whether Olson’s phone might reveal misconduct on Smith’s part, the appellate court wrote.</p><p id="75K4L7VMX5ADVCDSFFIOR6R3WU">Palmer learned during the conversation that the deputy’s card had been discovered in Olson’s car and asked the Idaho trooper to share the contents of Olson’s phone, but Idaho authorities rejected his request, according to the opinion.</p><p id="FY4CRKSUXZFGDH6TFBFGSX7KUY">Palmer then asked the district attorney to request the contents of Olson’s cellphone from Idaho police and review the material.</p><p id="GNIPSMRACRB37O7ZDFNKQ2ACLA">Palmer was allegedly concerned that his deputy “might be involved in illegal activities with Olson” that would require an internal investigation, the ruling said.</p><p id="PVAR47OU6JEXBJLTRTPVCARWLQ">Carpenter wrote to a prosecutor in the Jerome County District Attorney’s Office, saying the phone extraction “will be used only for internal purposes” and wouldn’t be disseminated to another agency or third party, according to the ruling. </p><p id="GZJBC66NF5FEZMMRNP4QJSMBGM">An Idaho prosecutor then shared a flash drive containing the contents of Olson’s phone with Carpenter.</p><p id="D4RLJA22ONBL7LOMWAL7QJZEVY">Carpenter immediately violated his pledge to Idaho police and asked detectives from two outside agencies, the Oregon State Police and the Deschutes County Sheriff’s Office, to review the flash drive material, according to the appellate opinion. </p><p id="TW5Q6GFB5ZFD5OXGQRQQ674EBI">Both agencies declined, because it wasn’t tied to a criminal investigation, the opinion said.</p><p id="UXJFYLXVTVCRBBDTKO46GZY5ZI">Carpenter reviewed the phone contents himself in April 2019, found nude photos of both Olson and Smith and contacted the sheriff to tell him that the phone showed evidence of an intimate relationship between Smith and Olson, the ruling said.</p><p id="SEHCX4HGJJA7ZIOASAKWEC5FYU">But Carpenter added in his letter to the sheriff that he found no evidence of misconduct by Smith on the phone, according to court records.</p><p id="53Z26XHSKNDQBPUUJ5TGB7TZQE">Olson argued in her lawsuit that the district attorney shared the nude photos with the sheriff, but both Carpenter and Palmer denied those allegations. </p><p id="DUNWJVNTEJFJXJTMVAEUYQUCHE">Yet Palmer testified in his deposition that Carpenter twice offered him a copy of the thumb drive and told him, “There were things on the cell phone that, ‘once you see them, you can’t unsee them,’” according to the ruling.</p><p id="HNUTXA7K5BCFFGQZX6W2B5MK4I">Oslon said she started hearing gossip regarding her arrest, the examination of her phone, her relationship with Smith and the nude photos -- “all seemingly originating from the sheriff’s office,” the opinion said.</p><p id="UEWQED7GKFCXHGNDYXSK3FHTEU">Olson said a Grant County deputy whom she didn’t know came into her marijuana store and told her that he had heard “there’s some pretty smokin’ pictures of you going around the sheriff’s office,” the appeals court wrote</p><p id="YLD72IBZGFHANPRXXFEGLJ6CME">Another witness reported observing two sheriff’s employees looking at nude photos of Olson on a phone, according to the opinion. </p><p id="QFRKHWBFSZEMLBNUMMEYYYYTFQ">One of Olson’s customers asked her, “What happened to ya out in Idaho? Palmer told me you got arrested” and later said he had heard something about the contents on her phone, according to court records.</p><p id="7PPLDJVJDNHBVFRXYF77QXMKB4">Olson sued Palmer, Carpenter and Grant County in federal court, alleging violation of her Fourth Amendment right to be free from an unreasonable search and 14th Amendment right to privacy. </p><p id="DMXHJPM5XBA2DKQGMHDK7IJOUM">U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut of Portland threw out the case, finding that Carpenter was entitled to qualified immunity and that Palmer had no “supervisory liability” because she found no evidence that the sheriff had reviewed the cellphone material or supervised Carpenter.</p><p id="LPAZX2KJCNCZ7IMK5YQFQXRLFY">But 9th Circuit Judge M. Margaret McKeown determined Carpenter’s review of the cellphone material was an unreasonable search, considering it was done “without consent, without a warrant and without even a suspicion of further criminal activity by Olson or even Smith.”</p><p id="GXQTAMVR2ZBT5KSETEV6ZQLIM4">McKeown, writing for the majority, said the Idaho State Police consent form that Olson signed didn’t extend to a search of the phone by a different law enforcement agency “in another state, for evidence of her boyfriend’s theoretical misdeeds.”</p><p id="4KNAKL5TQRBCVBUKDUOU7WHULE">Although Palmer denied seeing or sharing the contents of Olson’s phone with members of the public, Olson’s allegations that strangers made derogatory comments to her regarding the circulation of her nude photos “also support the claim that Olson’s private information was shared far beyond the scope of her original consent,” McKeown wrote.</p><p id="B5USDBT5I5AMFFQOC7UXUGPF4E">“Palmer was ‘curious’ about whether Olson’s phone might reveal misconduct on Smith’s part, and Carpenter was interested in reviewing the phone for possible Brady material in cases where Smith might testify,” the opinion said. </p><p id="KU5Q6PYOQNBMVL4OXMQWZRSXGU">Under the landmark 1963 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Brady v. Maryland, police must inform prosecutors about an officer’s potential credibility problems on the witness stand or the need to turn over information that might be favorable to defense attorneys in a case.</p><p id="6UFHLNAJ7ZAKFGR3TWPM5QRKAM">“But neither Palmer’s curiosity nor Carpenter’s improbable search for Brady material for some hypothetical future investigation justifies expanding the consent form’s express scope,” McKeown wrote.</p><p id="IMB4Z33NENC6LKVTBRXYCHZO5M">McKeown found Carpenter’s explanation for his search of the phone material unbelievable. </p><p id="ALA2KUMFDZES5EDOWDKSZOZ4OI">“It defies common sense to hypothesize a potential Brady complication when there has been no prosecution, no investigation, nor even a whiff of criminal activity,” she wrote. </p><p id="DOANPTF5MRAW7ACIG6OKEX2N5U">The 9th Circuit panel also blasted Carpenter’s claim that his actions comported with longstanding practices of electronic data sharing between law enforcement agencies, calling it “devoid of any supporting authority.”</p><p id="OAHSVDN4XJHMNAKM5T2PJMXC5A">Jill Conbere, the Oregon Justice Department lawyer who defended Carpenter in the case, argued that information sharing between law enforcement agencies “is standard practice in many contexts.”</p><p id="HTVB5UYA3JBNZLKQD37HN3P6ZM">Conbere said Carpenter wasn’t required to get a warrant before accessing the phone data because Olson had given Idaho State Police consent to search her phone.</p><p id="OZW2AMR4ZBGOJJUZKGJHIXJ6SM">Yet the 9th Circuit’s majority ruling noted, “At every turn, Carpenter and Palmer were stymied by other law enforcement personnel or agencies in both Idaho and Oregon that refused to aid them. The Idaho state trooper declined to give Palmer the extraction of Olson’s phone, and the other criminal investigation agencies in Oregon declined to review the data when asked by Carpenter, because there were no allegations of a crime, and therefore nothing for them to investigate.”</p><p id="ZGQBPRVQ7ZFOLOZTXJZB4ZFDL4">In a separate concurring 9th Circuit opinion, Circuit Judge Daniel A. Bress agreed that the court should uphold the trial court’s granting of immunity and dismissal of the claims. But he wrote that the panel should have simply affirmed the lower court ruling and not gone on to find a constitutional violation. </p><p id="NMD5TCYVLZBATCPEJGDYC6BN7Y">It’s unclear, Bress wrote, whether Idaho authorities are more at fault, for example. “In my respectful view, prudence here dictated that we decide only what we needed to decide,” he wrote.</p><p id="GMTML2LN45GS3CRPPMUXTLSCQQ">Later in 2019 in an unrelated case, Smith was fired from the sheriff’s office after his arrest on alleged assault and sex abuse complaints. </p><p id="T7FW7ECEYNA2BNPI7UBBEP7J4E">He was acquitted of all charges in 2022, and argued in a federal whistleblower complaint that Palmer retaliated against him for reporting misconduct involving another sheriff’s deputy, who was the wife of Palmer’s undersheriff. Smith obtained more than $1.3 million from Grant County and the state of Oregon in a series of settlements after challenging his firing in the whistleblower complaint, the <a href="https://www.bluemountaineagle.com/news/ex-grant-county-deputy-reaps-1-3-million-legal-settlement/article_dc60bcb0-d846-11ee-b191-ffaffee43bfe.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bluemountaineagle.com/news/ex-grant-county-deputy-reaps-1-3-million-legal-settlement/article_dc60bcb0-d846-11ee-b191-ffaffee43bfe.html">Blue Mountain Eagle</a> reported.

<p><span>Amid anger and</span> protest over the Trump administration’s plan to deport millions of immigrants, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement plans to monitor and locate “negative” social media discussion about the agency and its top officials, according to contract documents reviewed by The Intercept.</p>



<p>Citing an increase in threats to ICE agents and leadership, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25517962-statement-of-objectives/">the agency is soliciting pitches from private companies</a> to monitor threats across the internet — with a special focus on social media. People who simply criticize ICE online could pulled into the dragnet.</p>



<p>“In order to prevent adversaries from successfully targeting ICE Senior leaders, personnel and facilities, ICE requires real-time threat mitigation and monitoring services, vulnerability assessments, and proactive threat monitoring services,” the procurement document reads.</p>



<p>If this scanning uncovers anything the agency deems suspicious, ICE is asking its contractors to drill down into the background of social media users.</p>



<p>That includes:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Previous social media activity which would indicate any additional threats to ICE; 2). Information which would indicate the individual(s) and/or the organization(s) making threats have a proclivity for violence; and 3). Information indicating a potential for carrying out a threat (such as postings depicting weapons, acts of violence, refences to acts of violence, to include empathy or affiliation with a group which has violent tendencies; references to violent acts; affections with violent acts; eluding [sic] to violent acts.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s unclear how exactly any contractor might sniff out someone’s “proclivity for violence.” The ICE document states only that the contractor will use “social and behavioral sciences” and “psychological profiles” to accomplish its automated threat detection.</p>



<!-- BLOCK(cta)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) -->

<!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[0] -->



<p>Once flagged, the system will further scour a target’s internet history and attempt to reveal their real-world position and offline identity. In addition to compiling personal information — such as the Social Security numbers and addresses of those whose posts are flagged — the contractor will also provide ICE with a “photograph, partial legal name, partial date of birth, possible city, possible work affiliations, possible school or university affiliation, and any identified possible family members or associates.”</p>



<div><p>The document also requests “Facial Recognition capabilities that could take a photograph of a subject and search the internet to find all relevant information associated with the subject.” The contract contains specific directions for targets found in other countries, implying the program would scan the domestic speech of American citizens.</p><!-- BLOCK(promote-post)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22slug%22%3A%22immigrants%22%2C%22crop%22%3A%22promo%22%7D) -->  </div>
<!-- END-BLOCK(promote-post)[1] -->&nbsp;



<p>The posting indicates that ICE isn’t merely looking to detect direct threats of violence, but also online criticism of the agency.</p>



<p>As part of its mission to protect ICE with “proactive threat monitoring,” the winning contractor will not simply flag threatening remarks but “Provide monitoring and analysis of behavioral and social media sentiment (i.e. positive, neutral, and negative).” This includes regular updates on the “total number of negative references to ICE found in social media” from week to week.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“ICE’s attempt to have eyes and ears in as many places as we exist both online and offline should ring an alarm.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Such sentiment analysis — typically accomplished via machine-learning techniques — could place under law enforcement scrutiny speech that is constitutionally protected. Simply stated, a post that is critical or even hostile to ICE isn’t against the law.</p>



<p>“ICE’s attempts to capture and assign a judgement to people’s ‘sentiment’ throughout the expanse of the internet is beyond concerning,” said Cinthya Rodriguez, an organizer with the immigrant rights group Mijente. “The current administration’s attempt to use this technology falls within the agency’s larger history&nbsp;of mass surveillance, which includes gathering information from personal social media accounts and retaliating against immigrant activists. ICE’s attempt to have eyes and ears in as many places as we exist both online and offline should ring an alarm for all of us.”</p>



  



<p>Scanning online speech in the name of homeland security is a <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/86876/dhss-newest-target-atlanta-cop-city-activists/">bipartisan</a> initiative. The document soliciting contractors appears nearly identical to a procurement document published by ICE in 2020, which resulted in a $5.5 million contract between the agency and Barbaricum, a Washington-based defense and intelligence contractor. A new contract has not yet been awarded. ICE spokesperson Jocelyn Biggs told The Intercept, “While ICE anticipates maintaining its threat risk monitoring services, we cannot speculate on a specific timeline for future contract decisions.”</p>

<p>ICE already has <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-ices-database-derogatory-information-giant-oak-gost/">extensive social media surveillance capabilities</a> provided by federal contractor Giant Oak, which under both Trump’s first term and the Biden administration sought “derogatory” posts about the United States to inform immigration-related decision-making. The goal of this contract, ostensibly, is focused more narrowly on threats to ICE leadership, agents, facilities, and operations.</p>



<p>Civil liberties advocates told The Intercept the program had grave speech implications under the current administration. “While surveillance programs like this under any administration are a concerning privacy and free speech violation and I would fight to stop them, the rhetoric of the Trump administration makes this practice especially terrifying,” said Calli Schroeder, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “Threats to ‘punish’ opponents or deport those exercising 1st Amendment rights combine with these invasive practices to create a real ‘thought police’ scenario.”</p>

They wanted to chart their own paths, make money for themselves, and have fun doing so. They’d had significant exposure to UNIX at university, and there was a new, free, and open source kernel called Linux from Helsinki. At the same time, there was Peter MacDonald’s Linux distribution, the Softlanding System (SLS), and Patrick Volkerding was publishing fixes for SLS and making them freely available via FTP. Somewhat problematically, most UNIX systems and most Linux systems were exclusively English language oriented. These four students were ready to do something for themselves and they began the process of localizing SLS into German.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png" width="728" height="633.1549295774648" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:494,&quot;width&quot;:568,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:728,&quot;bytes&quot;:293158,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Burchard Steinbild, Hubert Mantel, Roland Dyroff, Thomas Fehr</figcaption></figure></div><p>On the 2nd of September in 1992, the quartet founded Gesellschaft für Software und Systementwicklung mbH (or S.u.S.E.). In English that would be Software and System Development, but the contraction S.u.S.E. also bore more than a passing similarity to the name of Konrad Zuse who’d built the world’s first programmable and Turing-complete computer (depending upon how one defines this) the Z3 in May of 1941.</p><p><span>Shortly after they began, Patrick Volkerding released </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-slackware" rel="">Slackware Linux</a><span>. Their work then shifted to localizing Slackware, and they managed to obtain assistance in this endeavor from Volkerding. Of course, translations weren’t quite enough to get a company going. They chose to focus on localization, software development, distribution, documentation, and customer support. With the kind of energy seemingly available only to college students, they worked hundred hour weeks, and they sought no outside investment having opted to sell software CD-ROMs and floppies to fund their endeavor (via phone/mail and retail boxes). They were among the first resellers of Yggdrasil, and they also had their semi-localized versions of SLS and Slackware, along with patch sets. While this may not appear to be an obvious path to younger readers today, this was truly a huge service to their customers. The internet wasn’t widespread, and for those who had it, it was slow. Sure, one could download all forty Slackware floppy disk images, but it would take quite a bit of time on a 28.8kbps modem. Then, if someone in the household had needed to make a call, the download would have been interrupted. After that, one needed to have forty blank floppies available, and image each one, one at time. After what may have been intermittent work over the course of a few days, the potential Linux user was then greeted with a command line in a foreign language. The alternative was to call up S.u.S.E. with a number found in an advertisement in a trade magazine and get a CD-ROM for your 386/486 PC that had been localized to your own language. With that, you might also get a manual, again in your own language, that explained how the software system worked and what it was you might need to do to get things fully operational.</span></p><p>In these halcyon days, the young company had no real hierarchy, no regular meetings, no reports, and no bureaucracy. The company operated in a sort of democratic fashion. Being so small, everyone knew everything that was occurring at any given time. If a major decision needed to be made, they’d simply take an informal vote. If they had unanimity, they’d make the change and this meant that the company could change direction in a single night which was when they normally got the most work done.</p><p>In 1994, S.u.S.E released a fully localized version of Slackware Linux 2.0 with some patches and software incorporated from other Linux distributions, S.u.S.E. Linux 1.0. This release was quickly followed by 1.1.27 in July. This was a Linux system with the XFree86 2.1.1, TCP/IP, NFS, kernel 1.0.9, GNU CC 2.5.8 and 2.4.5, and documentation on disc. The system requirements were a 386 with at least 4MB of RAM, but if one intended to use X11 the RAM requirement was a minimum of 8MB. The system supported ISA, EISA, VLB, and PCI, but it did not support MCA.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg" width="1456" height="1132" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1132,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4403305,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>S.u.S.E.

He began with writing patches for various UNIX and GNU packages to make them work on the Linux kernel, and he kept these separate from the vanilla sources. He then wrote a script that he placed at </span><code>/usr/bin/pkgpack</code><span> which would collect those patches and apply them prior to compilation. The distribution was shipped as a binary system on five floppy disks, and the first production installation was completed in 1994 at Saarland University for those studying law (Jura is “law” and “ix” is the common suffix for UNIX-like systems). This first install was online at </span><code>jura.uni-sb.de</code><span> and there were several client systems internally. The university used this system to make email, web, and other software available to students. La Roche joined S.u.S.E. in 1995.</span></p><p><span>With La Roche on the team, the company began work on their next major Linux release, but this time, the company was mixing in pieces of Jurix. From what I can tell, this was largely the build system. Slackware has used standardized bash scripts for package creation (these are now known as SlackBuilds), while Jurix had a system that would become AutoBuild, and much later the Open Build Service. Much like the purely Slackware-based S.u.S.E. Linux releases, this version would use a curses menu system for installation, and many users would boot to MS-DOS and then use </span><code>LOADLIN </code><span>to get into the Linux system. However, these similarities can be deceiving. The S.u.S.E. installer was for more polished and far more informative at each step. Version 4.2 (numbered for the answer to life the universe and everything) was released in May of 1996 with the Linux kernel 2.0 and YaST (yet another setup tool) 0.42. This release was on three CD-ROMs with one being the live filesystem and two for the installation. From DOS, the first install disc’s contents were as follows:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F182fa3ea-a342-460c-8f1c-418bc6e6742a_905x295.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F182fa3ea-a342-460c-8f1c-418bc6e6742a_905x295.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F182fa3ea-a342-460c-8f1c-418bc6e6742a_905x295.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F182fa3ea-a342-460c-8f1c-418bc6e6742a_905x295.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F182fa3ea-a342-460c-8f1c-418bc6e6742a_905x295.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F182fa3ea-a342-460c-8f1c-418bc6e6742a_905x295.png" width="905" height="295" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/182fa3ea-a342-460c-8f1c-418bc6e6742a_905x295.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:295,&quot;width&quot;:905,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:109984,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F182fa3ea-a342-460c-8f1c-418bc6e6742a_905x295.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F182fa3ea-a342-460c-8f1c-418bc6e6742a_905x295.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F182fa3ea-a342-460c-8f1c-418bc6e6742a_905x295.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F182fa3ea-a342-460c-8f1c-418bc6e6742a_905x295.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Most references of version 4.2 state that the distribution was only available in German, but this is incorrect.

This essentially runs through the LOADLIN portion for a second time, after which I restarted the setup, loaded the config for all packages, and proceeded with the installation.</p><div><figure><a

Linux version 5 was released in July of 1997, and that was the version to begin the transition of the distribution to RPMs. Slackware’s TGZs were still supported. That release used kernel 2.0.30, Bash 2.0, Qt 1.2, XFree86 3.3 and FVWM 4.0.45. October of that year saw the release of version 5.1 with the most notable changes being the support of FTP package updates and KDE. This version was five CD-ROMs. Four of these were for the installation, and one was for the LiveCD environment. The final version 5 release was on the 10th of September in 1998, version 5.3 with kernel 2.0.35, KDE 1.0, and Netscape Communicator version 4.05.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

Everything is a bit more refined, the installation was far more straight forward, and we can easily see that what has been reported as a complete rebase on Jurix, was truly more of a merger between the Slackware-rooted origin, and the RPM-based Jurix with its automatic build system. We can also see that S.u.S.E. was now evolving into something unique, something gestalt.

as well as more offices across Europe. Not long after these expansions came new partnerships with IBM, SAP, Compaq, and Oracle. For IBM and Compaq, this partnership included S.u.S.E. offering 24-hour support services. The same year, SuSE began offering servers pre-installed with S.u.S.E. Linux. For 1998, the company moved their corporate office from Fürth to Nürnberg. In 1999, the company opened a branch office in the UK.</p><p>The company released version 6.0 on the 21st of December in 1998, and with this release, the company rebranded as SuSE Linux. Version 6 shipped with kernel 2.0.36, and it saw point release up to 6.4 which released on the 9th of March in 2000. Version 6.4 included YaST2 which was graphical.</p><p>On the 27th of September in 2000, SuSE Linux version 7 was released. SuSE Linux Professional 7.0 consisted of six CD-ROMs and one DVD for those who had a DVD-ROM drive, two floppies for those who couldn’t boot from optical media, a quick install guide, a handbook, a configuration guide, and an applications guide. By this point, like many other commercial Linux distributions, SuSE included StarOffice, Netscape, Acrobat, GIMP, Sane, KDE, and other familiar applications. It had a graphical YaST2 setup tool, ReiserFS and ext2 filesystems, RPM package management, and retailed for $69.99. SuSE Linux Personal lacked many of the proprietary applications and shipped on three CDs. This version saw released for x86, Alpha, PPC, and SPARC. The last of the version 7 systems was 7.3 released on the 23rd of October in 2001.</p><p><span>In the late 1990s, it was becoming obvious that Linux was going to be a major player in the operating system space, and IBM was well aware. The company had been engaging with open source projects like Apache and Linux for their Power and x86 systems, but the idea of running any non-IBM operating system on an IBM mainframe was heresy within the company. Yet, this was something that IBM’s leadership knew needed to happen. To that end, in December of 1998, IBM began a secret project to port Linux and the GNU C toolchain to the S/390 in Böblingen. At this time, the company had no plans to release a distribution of their own, but they hoped to offer a starting point for distribution makers. This effort was released in December of 1999. SuSE was the first company to do anything with this, and their effort would reshape SuSE. They approached IBM in early 2000 with a proof of concept for which they received an orientation on IBM mainframes and a reference system for software development. They used their AutoBuild system to generate packages resulting in 400 or so in the first weekend. They then ported YaST and continued refinements. A major shakeup for SuSE was that this version incorporated some things more similar to Red Hat than to Slackware, such as the directory hierarchy and some file naming conventions. The prior origins could still be seen, but things were a bit more nuanced. The more difficult task for SuSE was really learning about the enterprise market with its low-volume, high reliability, and service intensive nature. On the 31st of October in 2000, SuSE Linux Enterprise Server was born. Linux had come to IBM S/390. SLES for x86 followed in April of 2001, and ports continued for </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-itanic-saga" rel="">Itanium</a><span>, PPC, and zSeries.</span></p><p>By November of 2000, something around 66% of SuSE’s revenues were from Linux CD-ROM sales at retail, online, over the phone. Roughly 24% was from services, and the remaining 8% or so was from hardware sales. The company had around forty developers working on open source software, and this didn’t include people who handled the compiling and packaging into RPMs (release engineers), or those who handled support services. Beyond this, the company contributed both money and talent to projects like ReiserFS, KDE, and the Linux kernel.</p><p><span>The recession of 2001 hit the company hard. First, thirty of the forty five employees at the Oakland office were laid off on the 8th of February in 2001, and the support services previously offered from that office were shifted to Germany. At this time, the company had grown to 470 employees, and they were one of the four major players in enterprise Linux globally (</span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-red-hat" rel="">Red Hat</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-caldera-part-1" rel="">Caldera</a><span>, Turbolinux, and a potential fifth, </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-linux-mandrake" rel="">Mandrake</a><span> fighting to make their entry). This move wasn’t quite unexpected. The US and German offices had never really worked together all too well, and the US office had seen four presidents in as many years. Later that year, Johannes Nussbickl took over the CEO role from Roland Dyroff. Nussbickl then went out attempting to secure venture funding, and slashed headcounts a bit further, about a quarter of all staff. Nussbickl was replaced by Richard Seibt the following year.</span></p><p>SuSE Linux 8.0 was released on the 22nd of April in 2002 with Linux kernel 2.4.18, KDE3, KOffice, and several other enhancements. The installer was more automated, had better hardware detection, and YaST2 could detect Windows partitions. Upon the detection of a Windows partition, the installer would suggest changes to hard disk allocation for the installation of SuSE. YaST2 was also much better at configuring the X server with SaX2 (SuSE advanced X configuration). On the media side of things, SuSE 8 included applications for audio mixing, editing, and CD writing. These audio applications were aided by the inclusion of ALSA 0.9 (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) which allowed for the playback of more than one audio stream at a time. Security enhancements also came to SuSE with SuSE Personal Firewall 2, GNU Privacy Guard, OpenSSH, PAM, and IPsec. Version 8 concluded with the release of 8.2 on the 7th of April in 2003.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png" width="1280" height="1024" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:379246,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>SuSE 8 default desktop</figcaption></figure></div><p>SuSE Linux 9.0 was released on the 15th of October in 2003 with Linux kernel 2.4.21, GNOME 2.2.3, and KDE 3.1.4. This version brought two major changes. First, SuSE Linux 9 was the first distribution to support AMD64. SuSE had reached out to AMD early in the Hammer architecture’s development, and they built an emulator from AMD’s specifications. The company then proceeded to port the entire distribution AMD64 with AutoBuild. When the first hardware arrived at their offices, the system worked flawlessly. The second big addition was support for NTFS (non-root) filesystems.</p><p><span>On the 13th of January in 2004, </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-novell" rel="">Novell</a><span> announced that it had completed its acquisition of SuSE, now styled SUSE, for $210 million in cash. With this completed, IBM then invested $50 million in Novell. This followed Novell’s acquisition of Ximian in 2003. Ximian had developed Ximian Evolution (eMail client), Connector (plugin for Evolution offering MS Exchange support), Red Carpet (RPM-based package manager), Bonobo (MS OLE-like), and Mono (.NET framework for Linux). These acquisitions fundamentally changed Novell. The company’s prior focus on networking products was gone, and the company became, at its core, an enterprise Linux company. That is, it essentially became the SUSE company. For many at the company, this was actually a welcomed change. The company had been on the verge of insolvency for quite sometime, the lay offs were obviously horrible (not just for those who lost jobs, but also for the increased workload for those who remained), and this take over brought some breathing room. </span></p><p>The first release after acquisition was SUSE Linux 9.1 on the 23rd of April in 2004. This version shipped with kernel 2.6.4, GNOME 2.4, and KDE 3.2.1. SUSE 9.1 brought in some visual changes between the personal and professional editions as well. The personal editions maintained the green theming while the professional editions had blue theming. This was also evident in the default background images.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

A single CD release was available without support of any kind. For the most part, this was just SUSE Personal without some extra packages.</p><p>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 was released in August of 2004 and Novell Linux Desktop 9 (built on much the same package base) was released on the 8th of November in 2004. This release saw official support from IBM, HP, Sun, Dell, SGI, Lenovo, and Fujitsu. For the first time, GNOME became the default, but KDE remained present. Naturally, Ximian’s Evolution became Novell Evolution. Given events at Sun, StarOffice was replaced by OpenOffice. With more of the Ximian acquisition in evidence, the availability of software updates were made apparent to the user with a Red Carpet icon.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7c5ed46-5f1e-4b2b-9ce3-3156e1487668_680x510.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7c5ed46-5f1e-4b2b-9ce3-3156e1487668_680x510.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7c5ed46-5f1e-4b2b-9ce3-3156e1487668_680x510.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7c5ed46-5f1e-4b2b-9ce3-3156e1487668_680x510.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7c5ed46-5f1e-4b2b-9ce3-3156e1487668_680x510.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7c5ed46-5f1e-4b2b-9ce3-3156e1487668_680x510.png" width="724" height="543" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f7c5ed46-5f1e-4b2b-9ce3-3156e1487668_680x510.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:510,&quot;width&quot;:680,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:724,&quot;bytes&quot;:512071,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7c5ed46-5f1e-4b2b-9ce3-3156e1487668_680x510.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7c5ed46-5f1e-4b2b-9ce3-3156e1487668_680x510.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7c5ed46-5f1e-4b2b-9ce3-3156e1487668_680x510.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7c5ed46-5f1e-4b2b-9ce3-3156e1487668_680x510.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Novell Linux Desktop 9, with GNOME 2</figcaption></figure></div><p>While SUSE had been an enterprise focused distribution for quite a while, on the 4th of August in 2005, Novell announced that the creation of the openSUSE Project.

Xen, the ext3 filesystem, Firefox 2, and NetworkManager. To my knowledge, this was the first major inclusion of Xen in any Linux system. Both enterprise server and desktop versions of 10 were released in July of 2006, and the Novell Linux Desktop was dropped in favor of SUSE Linux Enterprise Deskstop. Version bumps and the name change to openSUSE arrived with 10.2 on the 7th of Decemer in 2006. The final version 10 release was made on the 4th of October in 2007 with 10.3 featuring kernel 2.6.22, GNOME 2.12, KDE 3.5.1, and XFCE 4.4.1. This version also included a preview release of KDE4 Beta 2. On the enterprise side, updates were shipped in Service Packs with SP4, the final version 10 service pack, having shipped on the 15th of April in 2011.</p><p>In November of 2006, Microsoft and Novell signed an intellectual property agreement that involved immunity over patent litigation and freed SUSE Linux users over any possibility of lawsuits from Microsoft. This followed claims from Microsoft that Linux systems were in violation of 235 patents without any disclosure over what those violations were. While some in the community viewed this negatively and were quite vocal about it, this did gain some piece of mind for SUSE to include things like Exchange support, MS Office file format support, and interoperability between the two companies’ directory implementations. This would prove to have lasting effects on both the wider Linux ecosystem and on Microsoft. In the following years, improvements in MS Office support would proliferate, Active Directory support would be common, and Microsoft’s Azure would have Linux support. Microsoft even made SQL Server, VS Code, and Powershell available on Linux.</p><p><span>openSUSE 11 was released on the 19th of June 2008. This version introduced ZYpp (Zen/YaST Packages Patches Patterns Products) for package management. The command for invocation was </span><code>zypper</code><span> and ZYpp was implemented primarily in C++ under the GPLv2. Of course, this is SUSE, so the graphical ZYpp implementation was YaST. The new package manager would hit 1.0 with openSUSE 11.1’s release on the 18th of December in 2008. ZYpp was later adopted by Ark, Meego, Sailfish, and Tizen. Version 11.2 came on the 12th of November in 2009 and introduced the ext4 filesystem and preliminary support for Btrfs, full disk encryption, and support for USB boot with all ISOs. Version 11.3 was released on the 15th of July in 2010 and brought LXDE to SUSE. The final version 11 system, 11.4, was released on the 3rd of March in 2011. It moved SUSE from OpenOffice to LibreOffice, and brought Firefox 4 to the distribution. The enterprise Linux variants shipped on the 24th of March in 2009 with the inclusion of some proprietary software like Flash, Moonlight, Mono, AD support, and Exchange Server integration.</span></p><p>On the 22nd of November in 2010, Novell and Attachmate announced that Novell would be acquired by Attachmate. Jeff Hawn, chairman and CEO of Attachmate, commented:</p><blockquote><p><em>The openSUSE project is an important part of the SUSE business. As noted in the agreement announced today, Attachmate plans to operate SUSE as a stand-alone business unit after the transaction closes. If this transaction closes, then after closing, Attachmate Corporation anticipates no change to the relationship between the SUSE business and the openSUSE project as a result of this transaction.</em></p></blockquote><p>On the 30th of April in 2011, Attachmate completed their acquisition of Novell. On Monday, the 2nd of May, eight hundred employees were laid off. </p><p>openSUSE 12.1 came into the world on the 16th of November in 2011 with kernel 3.1.0, GNOME 3.2, and KDE 4.7. This release also included Snapper for Btrfs snapshot management, and systemd for the init system. System V init was still available to users should they want it. Version 12.2 hit on the 5th of September in 2012 with KDE Plasma 4.8, GNOME 3.4, XFCE 4.10, Firefox 14, Plymouth, GRUB 2, and kernel 3.4.6. Version 12.3, the final for the 12 series, released on the 13th of March in 2013. This version gave version bumps to most software, did away with LiveCDs in favor of USB images, and introduced a “rescue” image with XFCE. </p><p>openSUSE version 13.1 was released on the 19th of November in 2013 with kernel 3.11.6, GNOME 3.10, KDE Plasma 4.11.2, Firefox 25, LibreOffice 4.1, experimental Wayland support, and YaST rewritten in Ruby. SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 was built on openSUSE 13, and it shipped on the 28th of October in 2014. openSUSE 13.2 followed on the 4th of November in 2014 with version bumps across the board. That same month, the openSUSE project introduced openSUSE Tumbleweed. This is a rolling release distribution with periodic snapshots made into installable images for i686, AMD64, ARM 64, PPC64, IBM zSystems, KVM, Xen, HyperV, and public and private cloud. Live system images are available with GNOME, KDE, XFCE, and rescue.</p><p>On the 20th of November in 2014, Micro Focus completed its acquisition of Attachmate. Under Micro Focus, SUSE was operated independently from the rest of the organization with its own products. Nils Brauckmann became CEO of SUSE and gained a board seat at Micro Focus.</p><p>With rolling releases now available, the traditional openSUSE system became openSUSE Leap. The first release of Leap hearkened back to the distribution’s history with version 42.1 becoming available on the 4th of November in 2015. This system was based off of enterprise 12 SP1. With another reference to history, Leap brought about a return to KDE as the default desktop with KDE Plasma 5.8. The 42 series saw two updated releases with 42.2 on the 16th of November in 2016, and 42.3 on the 26th of July in 2017. These later releases were based off of SP2 and SP3 respectively.</p><p>On the 25th of May in 2018, SUSE released Leap 15 with SUSE Linux Enterprise following on the 25th of June. These were built on the same codebase with GNOME 3.26, LibreOffice 6, GCC 7, Wayland as the display server, and kernel 4.12. Updates of this release are the current offering as of this writing.</p><p>Micro Focus sold SUSE to EQT AB on the 2nd of July in 2018 for $2.535 billion. Melissa Di Donato became CEO on the 22nd of July in 2019. SUSE finally went public on the Frankfurt stock exchange on the 19th of May in 2021. The company was valued at about $6.1 billion on the first day of trading. Di Donato resigned on the 21st of March in 2023 with Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen being appointed as CEO. On the 17th of August in 2023, EQT delisted SUSE. On the 13th of November in 2023, SUSE merged with Marcel New Lux IV S.A. and the combined entity became SUSE S.A.</p><p>I now have readers from many of the companies whose history I cover, and many of you were present for time periods I cover. A few of you are mentioned by name in my articles.

<p>Apple is feeling the heat over its acclaimed iPhone privacy policy after a German regulator's review of iOS tracking consent alleged that the tech giant exempted itself from the rules it enforces on third-party developers.</p>
<p>In a preliminary legal assessment of Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework (ATTF), Germany's competition watchdog <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Meldung/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2025/02_13_2025_ATTF.html?nn=48916">said</a> the "strict requirements under the ATTF only apply to third-party app providers, not to Apple itself."</p>
<p>It is a common tactic to track users across devices – sometimes by a free app dev trying to get paid a premium for "profiled" ads, sometimes by a technical vendor selling services to the ad industry or a content provider that traditionally would have run print ads, like a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/14/uk_newspaper_apple/">newspaper</a>. Whether or not users know it is happening and agree to it is probably a better question.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/05/14/shutterstock_uk_newspapers.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1" width="174" height="115" alt="A collection of UK national daily newspapers"></p><h2 title="Breaking news, perhaps literally: AI content blocking tool in Safari for iOS">Brit publishers beg Apple not to hurt online ad revenue</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/14/uk_newspaper_apple/"><span>READ MORE</span></a></p></div>
<p>Since 2021, when Apple set up the iOS ATTF, app devs have had to ask ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ users for their consent before applications could track their activity across other apps such as Facebook. Facebook owner Meta had a problem with this, especially when a 2022 ATTF update began to preclude advertisers from using data across their own platforms. This practice is known as "first-party" tracking as opposed to "third-party" tracking.</p>
<p>As one programmatic ad news outlet <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.adexchanger.com/mobile/how-facebook-is-overhauling-its-attribution-standards-to-deal-with-apples-att/">pointed out</a>, Facebook was actually hit the hardest by the 2022 first-party rules because its software development kit (SDK) "plugged into so many outside apps and ... its attribution pixels [were] littered liberally across the web." This meant that when an iPhone user with the latest ATTF update was on Instagram, data could not be collected on what the user was doing on Facebook, and vice versa.</p>

    

<p>Meta was so worried about this that it chalked up a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/03/facebook_q4_2021/">$10 billion hole</a> in potential ad sales to the move, with CFO Dave Wehner saying in a February <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/Meta-Q4-2021-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf">2022 earnings call</a> [PDF] discussing its full-year 2021 results: "We believe the impact of iOS overall as a headwind on our business in 2022 is on the order of $10 billion."</p>

        


        

<p>Judging by what the Bundeskartellamt said of its preliminary findings, though, Apple's "comprehensive digital ecosystem" appears to suffer less degradation in cross-tracking.</p>
<p>The Federal Cartel Office claims that Apple's ATTF defines "tracking" in a way that only covers data processing for advertising purposes across companies – but that these "strict ... rules do not cover Apple's own practice of combining user data across its ecosystem – from its App Store, Apple ID and connected devices – and using them for advertising purposes."</p>

</ul>
<p>Additionally, it says the consent dialogues for Apple's apps differ "substantially" from those of third-party apps. The current design, particularly the wording of the dialogue for Apple's own apps, makes it "more likely that users will consent than that of the ATTF dialogue for third-party apps."</p>
<p>It also claims that people using third-party apps will see up to four consecutive consent prompts, while Apple apps receive only a "maximum of two," which do not properly explain that Apple's processing of user data across services constitutes first-party tracking.</p>

        

<p>Apple has been under extra scrutiny in Germany since April 2023, when the regulator determined that Apple had "cross-market significance for competition," meaning it is now subject to "extended abuse control." Apple appealed to the Federal Court of Justice over this on January 28. The court's decision will be delivered on March 18.</p>
<p>Andreas Mundt, President of the Federal Cartel Office, said: "Apple operates a comprehensive digital ecosystem, which, through its many services and connected devices, the App Store and Apple ID, provides Apple with extensive access to user data relevant for advertising. Apple uses some of these data to offer advertising space for personalized advertising in its App Store, generating significant revenues."</p>
<p>He said advertising was also of "great commercial significance for other companies wishing to offer free apps, some of which compete with Apple's own services, in the App Store." Those providers do not have a "wealth of broad and deep user data to draw on" like Apple does, he added.</p>

        

<p>"For us, it is key that users can make a free and informed decision about whether or not their data may be used for personalized advertising at all. The question at hand is whether Apple is allowed to apply stricter criteria to other providers than to itself when it comes to requesting such user consent. In our preliminary view, doing so may amount to unequal treatment and self-preferencing, which are prohibited under competition law."</p>
<p>Apple had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>I propose that the advent and integration of AI models into the workflows of developers has stifled the adoption of new and potentially superior technologies due to training data cutoffs and system prompt influence.</p>
<p>I have noticed a bias towards specific technologies in multiple popular models and have noted anecdotally in conversation and online discussion people choosing technology based on how well AI tooling can assist with its usage or implementation.</p>
<p>While it has long been the case that developers have considered documentation and support availability when choosing software, AI’s influence dramatically amplifies this factor in decision-making, often in ways that aren’t immediately apparent and with undisclosed influence.</p>
<h2 id="the-knowledge-gap">The Knowledge Gap</h2>
<p>Large language models, especially those on the scale of many of the most accessible, popular hosted options, take humongous datasets and long periods to train. By the time everything has been scraped and a dataset has been built, the set is on some level already obsolete. Then, before a model can reach the hands of consumers, time must be taken to train and evaluate it, and then even more to finally deploy it.</p>
<p>Once it has finally released, it usually remains stagnant in terms of having its knowledge updated. This creates an AI knowledge gap. A period between the present and AI’s training cutoff. This gap creates a time between when a new technology emerges and when AI systems can effectively support user needs regarding its adoption, meaning that models will not be able to service users requesting assistance with new technologies, thus disincentivising their use.</p>
<p>The cutoff means that models are strictly limited in knowledge up to a certain point. For instance, Anthropic’s latest models have a cutoff of <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8114494-how-up-to-date-is-claude-s-training-data">April 2024</a>, and OpenAI’s latest models have cutoffs of <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models">late 2023</a>.</p>
<p>The influence of the popularisation of AI models has also led to the proliferation of AI slop content, which AI companies are likely trying to avoid introducing in their scraped data sets – potentially increasing this knowledge gap.</p>
<p>This knowledge gap doesn’t just stifle the adoption of new frameworks and tooling but also the adoption of new and potentially superior features introduced in updates to already in-use frameworks and tooling as a result of the models not yet including information about them in their training set. This is a lesser issue though, because a technology with existing market adoption is bound to have fanatics who will use it, create examples, and produce blog posts, documentation, and other media about it that will eventually end up in training data.</p>
<p>While some models are used in contexts where they are equipped with tooling, such as ChatGPT with its internet search capabilities, their prompts often only instruct them to use this functionality when explicitly requested by a user. Of course, plenty of implementations don’t have any access to any internet query functionality at all, such as Claude via its web interface, which will inform you it will only discuss things included in its training data.</p>
<p>Of course, if people are reluctant to adopt a new technology because of a lack of AI support, there will be fewer people likely to produce material regarding said technology, which leads to an overall inverse feedback effect. Lack of AI support prevents a technology from gaining the required critical adoption mass, which in turn prevents a technology from entering use and having material made for it, which in turn starves the model of training data, which in turn disincentivises selecting that technology, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Consider a developer working with a cutting-edge JavaScript framework released just months ago. When they turn to AI coding assistants for help, they find these tools unable to provide meaningful guidance because their training data predates the framework’s release. This forces developers to rely solely on potentially limited official documentation and early adopter experiences, which, for better or worse, tends to be an ‘old’ way of doing things and incentivises them to use something else.</p>
<h2 id="system-prompt-influence">System Prompt Influence</h2>
<p>I’ve anecdotally noticed that many AI tools have a ‘preference’ for React and Tailwind when asked to tackle a web-based task, or even to create any app involving an interface at all.</p>
<p>With Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which is generally my AI offering of choice given its superior coding ability, my “What personal preferences should Claude consider in responses?” profile setting includes the line “When writing code, use vanilla HTML/CSS/JS unless otherwise noted by me”. Despite this, Claude will <em>frequently</em> opt to generate new code with React, and in some occurrences even rewrite my existing code into React against my intent and without my consultation.</p>
<p>While Anthropic <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/release-notes/system-prompts">publishes Claude’s core system prompts</a>, they do not publish the system prompts of specific features, such as artifacts. However, a <a href="https://github.com/jujumilk3/leaked-system-prompts/blob/main/claude-artifacts_20240620.md">leaked system prompt</a> for Claude’s artifacts feature shows that both React and Tailwind are specifically mentioned with explicit instruction on how they should be handled. It also specifically mentions the diagramming tool <a href="http://mermaid.js.org/">Mermaid</a> and a set of React libraries, including <a href="https://recharts.org/">Recharts</a>, <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/">shadcn/ui</a>, and <a href="https://lucide.dev/">Lucide icons</a>, as well as <a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare’s cdnjs</a>.</p>
<p>This can be evidenced when asking Claude to use a certain technology, such as Svelte Runes, where it will instead direct the user towards its preferred technology. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Build me something with Svelte Runes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Claude:</strong> I apologize, but I am not able to create Svelte Runes components directly, as the artifact environment only supports certain technologies like React, HTML, and SVG. I can help you build something similar using React, or I can provide you with Svelte Runes code that you can use in your own Svelte project. Which would you prefer?</p>
<p>If you’d like to see a React version, I can create something with similar reactive functionality using React’s hooks. Or if you want Svelte Runes code specifically, I can write that for you to use in your own environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does provide a choice, but chances are someone will select <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_of_least_resistance">the path of least resistance</a>.</p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>To test if popular models do have built-in bias for React, I logged into the web interfaces of four of the current most popular AI chat platforms<sup><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> via my free account and asked the models to “Create me a web app. It can do anything.”. I repeated this with each of the four models three times in fresh chats with previous chats deleted and any shared context (such as ChatGPT’s memory feature) disabled or cleared between each test.</p>
<p>I asked Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet with blank personal preferences and artifacts enabled. The first time it opted to create a mood tracking app, the second a reading list manager, and the third time a to-do list. Each time it chose to generate it using React with Tailwind CSS for styling. It generated each project in an artifact which offered an interactive preview directly in the interface.</p>
<p>I asked OpenAI’s ChatGPT 4o with both custom instructions and memory disabled. It produced a note-taking app the first time, a random quote generator the second time, and a to-do list the third time. All using React with Tailwind for styling and presented in <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas">canvases</a>. These canvases came with a preview button, which, much like with Claude, offered an interactive preview of the React project it built directly in the interface.</p>
<p>I asked Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash with app activity disabled. All three times it built to-do list apps using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each time, it also noted that I should consider using JavaScript frameworks on the frontend, namely React, Angular, and Vue - in that order.</p>
<p>I asked DeepSeek’s DeepSeek-V3, and it returned a to-do list app using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the second request, it created a project outline for a to-do list app, but this time with Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, and SQLite. The third time, it created another outline for a note-taking app but with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.</p>
<p>DeepSeek had the greatest variation in technology used but is the least accessible model and didn’t actually ‘create’ the app as requested – merely a general outline for it.</p>
<p>These tests show both Claude and ChatGPT have a strong preference for React and Tailwind, <sup><a id="footnote-ref-2" href="#footnote-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> that Gemini has a preference for HTML/CSS/JS but will recommend React and that DeepSeek is much more flexible and varied with its technological choices, though requires more prompting to produce an actual output.</p>
<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>I’d suggest that a beginner developer, or someone creating an app exclusively via prompting, is likely to use ChatGPT due to its position in the zeitgeist and use whatever output the model first produces without much second thought – thus influencing their tech selection without their realising.</p>
<p>Even if a developer does opt to use another framework or toolset, there is a chance that the model will prod them towards a selection more aligned with its system prompt, even going as far as rewriting their code to its ‘preference’ against user request, as evidenced by Claude ignoring my request for vanilla web technologies.</p>
<p>That is assuming that a specific framework or toolset hasn’t already been chosen by the user specifically because they have heard or experienced it being best handled by AI models. Also, while this very much applies to larger technical choices, such as what framework or general tooling a project may choose, it also trickles down into smaller decisions, such as what libraries or modules they may import.</p>
<p>I think it is evident that AI models are influencing technology, and that the technologies currently in use – especially those that reached popularity before November 2022, when ChatGPT was released, or that are otherwise in current data sets – will be around for a long time to come, and that AI models’ preferential treatment of them will expand their adoption and lifespan.</p>
<p>I think it would be prudent for AI companies to provide more transparent documentation of technology biases in their models, like they disclose that their models can make mistakes. These models are becoming a common part of developer knowledge and decision-making, and we’re letting the training and prompting decisions of OpenAI, Anthropic, etc shape the entire direction of software development.</p>
<p>As for further research on this topic, if one had a collection of system prompts over time, it may be possible to compare them to download trends of specified packages and identify correlations. Of course, there are a lot of other influences on the download and adoption of packages, so this may prove difficult and provide data too noisy and influenced by outside variables to be unusable.</p>

<p>We’ve been upgrading the operating system from CentOS to Ubuntu on hosts across our fleet. Our CentOS hosts run an outdated Linux kernel version (3.10), whereas our Ubuntu hosts run a more modern kernel version (6.8). In August 2024, we began rolling out the Ubuntu upgrade across our Apache web servers. When we migrated larger portions of our fleet to Ubuntu, we began seeing elevated listen overflow errors. This elevated error rate prompted us to roll back the Ubuntu upgrade while we debugged:</p>

    What are listen overflows? <a href="#what-are-listen-overflows">#</a>
  
  
</h2>
    

<p>Apache listens on a socket for incoming web requests. When incoming requests arrive more quickly than Apache can serve them, the queue of requests waiting to be served grows longer. This queue is capped to a configurable size. When the queue overflows its maximum size, we have a <em>listen overflow</em>.</p>

<p>Listen overflows are a symptom of either of two things: the rate of incoming web requests is too high, and / or Apache is serving web requests too slowly.</p>

<p>Each listen overflow that occurs means we failed to serve a web request. This can result in user-facing errors. Furthermore, if the listen overflows are a symptom of web requests being served slowly, it means users may be experiencing slow page loads.</p>

    What’s causing listen overflows? <a href="#whats-causing-listen-overflows">#</a>
  
  
</h2>
    

<p>Listen overflows occurred a few minutes after a newly autoscaled web server was pooled. They did not tend to recur subsequently. Furthermore, web requests had elevated latency during this same time period:</p>

<p><img src="https://dasl.cc/assets/posts/2025-01-01-debugging-our-new-linux-kernel/i2.png" alt="web server listen overflow and web request latency graphs"></p>

<p>We believed listen overflows were occurring because web requests served in the first few minutes after the host was pooled were being served unusually slowly.</p>

<p>Log lines, <code>strace</code> timing information, and <a href="https://github.com/adsr/phpspy"><code>phpspy</code></a> flame graphs showed that network operations were executing particularly slowly. But investigating further, we found evidence that the network was performing normally. Instead, PHP had seemingly stalled for over a second. The below log line indicates that a memcached SET command was slow, but network packet captures on both the client and the server that we analyzed in Wireshark indicate that the SET command experienced normal network latency. The client waited over 1 second before sending the subsequent GET command, as if our PHP script stalled after the packet was received but before we recorded the elapsed time.</p>

<p>Adding on to the evidence pointing away from network problems, we saw a large spike in system CPU usage about four minutes after newly autoscaled hosts were booted. If we waited until after this spike in system CPU to pool the hosts, we experienced no listen overflows. This spike in system CPU only occurred on Ubuntu hosts – CentOS did not have this problem:</p>

<p><img src="https://dasl.cc/assets/posts/2025-01-01-debugging-our-new-linux-kernel/i4.png" alt="system CPU graph"></p>

<p>This made us realize that the problems we were seeing were unrelated to pooling the hosts – the spike in system CPU occurred regardless of whether the hosts were pooled. During the spike in system CPU, we saw logs in <code>dmesg</code>:</p>

<p><code>workqueue: inode_switch_wbs_work_fn hogged CPU for &gt;10000us 4 times, consider switching to WQ_UNBOUND</code></p>

<p>And <code>htop</code> showed kernel workers were using lots of CPU in a function <code>inode_switch_wbs</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://dasl.cc/assets/posts/2025-01-01-debugging-our-new-linux-kernel/i5.png" alt="htop screenshot"></p>

<p>We made a <code>perf</code> recording demonstrating that when system CPU spikes, the kernel is busy inside <code>inode_switch_wbs_work_fn</code>:</p>

    Why did we initially suspect the network? <a href="#why-did-we-initially-suspect-the-network">#</a>
  
  
</h2>
    

<p>Our logs and profiling tools showed that network operations were executing particularly slowly. However, when CPU is busy, network operations may appear to slow down disproportionately. Network calls require CPU <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch">context switches</a> (I think?). After a process blocked on network receives a response, the process may spend a long time waiting in the CPU <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_queue">run queue</a> before it gets scheduled again when the CPU is busy. Network operations that appear slow at the user space level may be a symptom of CPU busyness.</p>

<p>Although there can be cases where this is not true, it has been my experience that when the network is the cause of slowness, CPU usage on client hosts is often lower than normal. When the client is blocked waiting for the network, it is often more idle. In retrospect, perhaps the fact that elevated CPU was one of the symptoms we were seeing should have pointed us away from network issues.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-writeback-no">
  
  
    Is it writeback? (no) <a href="#is-it-writeback-no">#</a>
  
  
</h2>
    

<p>We believed something in the kernel function <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/906bd684e4b1e517dd424a354744c5b0aebef8af/fs/fs-writeback.c#L490"><code>inode_switch_wbs_work_fn</code></a> was causing elevated system CPU. This function is in a file <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/fs/fs-writeback.c"><code>fs-writeback.c</code></a>, which contains functions related to the <a href="https://github.com/firmianay/Life-long-Learner/blob/master/linux-kernel-development/chapter-16.md">writeback functionality of the Linux page cache</a>. We knew that system CPU was elevated about four minutes after new hosts were booted. One of the first things a new host does is download the latest code – this is part of our host bootstrapping process and involves writing thousands of files to disk. We wondered if the process of flushing the dirty pages to disk was causing the elevated system CPU. While we did not see elevated disk write metrics during the system CPU spike, we decided to test this theory. We added a <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sync.1.html"><code>sync</code></a> call after the <code>rsync</code> command that downloads the code on new hosts. In theory, that should synchronously write the dirty pages in the page cache to disk. Perhaps by controlling when the page cache was flushed to disk, we could control when the spike in system CPU occurred and ensure that it occurred before we pooled the host. This attempt, however, was unsuccessful. We saw no spike in system CPU when calling <code>sync</code>. Furthermore, we still saw the spike in system CPU a minute or two later.</p>

<p>We were back to the drawing board. As we mentioned above, one of the first things a new host does is download the latest code. This process is called <code>setupwebroot</code>, and it runs as a <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.service.html">systemd oneshot</a> service. We found something perplexing: if we prevented the <code>setupwebroot</code> service from running, we never saw the spike in system CPU. And if we subsequently ran the <code>setupwebroot</code> service manually, we would see the spike in system CPU a couple minutes later. This implies that something in <code>setupwebroot</code> was the cause of the issues. However, if we ran the <code>rsync</code> command in <code>setupwebroot</code> manually in our interactive shell, we saw no spikes in system CPU. This apparent contradiction led us on a wild goose chase of trying to determine if some systemd service that was dependent on <code>setupwebroot</code> was the cause of the elevated system CPU, or if there was some subtle difference in the way we were running the commands in our shell versus how systemd was running the commands.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-inode-cgroup-switching-yes">
  
  
    Is it inode cgroup switching? (yes) <a href="#is-it-inode-cgroup-switching-yes">#</a>
  
  
</h2>
    

<p>Each of the thousands of files that is written by the <code>setupwebroot</code> service has a corresponding <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/ext4/inodes.html">index node</a>, also known as an inode, that the kernel uses to store file metadata. <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.0/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#control-group-v2">Control groups</a>, also known as cgroups, are a feature of Linux which allows for setting per process limits on system resources. For example, cgroups allow us to limit a given process from consuming too much memory, disk I/O, network bandwidth, etc. Every process belongs to a cgroup. Cgroups form a tree-like hierarchical structure. Processes in a given cgroup are given limits both by the cgroup to which they belong and that cgroup’s parents.</p>

<p>In the context of cgroups, page cache writeback is tracked at the inode level. A given inode is assigned to whichever cgroup contains the process that is responsible for the majority of writes to the inode’s file. If a new process starts writing a lot to a file, the file’s inode may switch to the new process’s cgroup. Likewise, if a process managed by systemd is terminated, systemd will <a href="https://systemd.io/CGROUP_DELEGATION/#controller-support">remove the process’s cgroup</a>, at which point any inodes assigned to the process’s cgroup will be moved to the parent cgroup.</p>

<p><img src="https://dasl.cc/assets/posts/2025-01-01-debugging-our-new-linux-kernel/i6.png" alt="cgroup diagram">
<em>Initially, inodes are assigned to <code>setupwebroot</code>’s cgroup</em></p>

<em><code>setupwebroot</code> finishes. Systemd removes its cgroup, and inodes are moved to the parent cgroup</em></p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/906bd684e4b1e517dd424a354744c5b0aebef8af/fs/fs-writeback.c#L490"><code>inode_switch_wbs_work_fn</code></a> that we believed was causing the elevated system CPU is responsible for moving an inode from one cgroup to another in the context of writeback. We got more insight by running this <a href="https://github.com/bpftrace/bpftrace"><code>bpftrace</code></a> command on a newly booted host:</p>

<div><pre><code>% sudo bpftrace -e '
tracepoint:writeback:inode_switch_wbs {
  printf(
    "[%s] inode is switching! inode: %d old cgroup: %d new cgroup: %d\n",
    strftime("%H:%M:%S", nsecs),
    args-&gt;ino,
    args-&gt;old_cgroup_ino,
    args-&gt;new_cgroup_ino
  );
}'
</code></pre></div>

<p>During the spike in system CPU, we saw thousands of these lines printed out by the <code>bpftrace</code> command:</p>

<div><pre><code>[20:49:30] inode is switching! inode: 3730800 old cgroup: 22438 new cgroup: 88
[20:49:30] inode is switching! inode: 3730799 old cgroup: 22438 new cgroup: 88
...

</code></pre></div>

<p>Each line corresponds to a file written by <code>setupwebroot</code> that was switching from <code>setupwebroot</code>’s dying cgroup to the parent cgroup. The old cgroup identifier (<code>22438)</code> corresponds to <code>setupwebroot</code>’s cgroup. The new cgroup identifier (<code>88</code>) corresponds to the parent cgroup.</p>

<p>The <code>bpftrace</code> command prints out data from a <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/906bd684e4b1e517dd424a354744c5b0aebef8af/fs/fs-writeback.c#L415">kernel tracepoint</a> in the Linux kernel’s <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/906bd684e4b1e517dd424a354744c5b0aebef8af/include/trace/events/writeback.h#L216-L243">writeback code</a>. The fields available to print in this tracepoint can be viewed via:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>We found that when we added a <code>sleep 3600</code> to the end of the script that <code>setupwebroot</code> executes, we could delay the spike in system CPU by one hour. Because systemd only removes a service’s cgroup when its process exits, the <code>sleep</code> delayed when inodes switched from one cgroup to another.</p>

<p>We found a systemd directive that allows us to turn off certain cgroup accounting features: <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.resource-control.html#Control%20Group%20Management"><code>DisableControllers</code></a>. If either the <code>io</code> or <code>memory</code> controllers are disabled, the kernel <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/c291c9cfd76a8fb92ef3d66567e507009236ce90/include/linux/backing-dev.h#L172">will not</a> perform cgroup writeback or any of the related accounting and cgroup switching. We found that by creating a systemd <a href="https://gist.github.com/dasl-/87b849625846aed17f1e4841b04ecc84#file-dasl-slice-L5">slice with those controllers disabled</a> and configuring <code>setupwebroot</code>’s unit file to <a href="https://gist.github.com/dasl-/06ced03d4b905fd79d8d58283ecaf67d#file-setupwebroot-service-L7">use that slice</a>, we could no longer reproduce the elevated system CPU. We had solved our performance issue.</p>

<p>No more system CPU spike and no more listen overflows:

<p>We came up with a minimal reproduction of the issue:</p>

<p><code>$ sudo mkdir -p /var/random-files &amp;&amp; sudo systemd-run --property=Type=oneshot bash -c 'dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1024 count=400000 | split -a 16 -b 1k - /var/random-files/file.'</code></p>

<p>This command creates 400,000 files, each consisting of 1,024 random bytes. The files have names like <code>/var/random-files/file.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</code> and <code>/var/random-files/file.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaab</code>. This command is run as a systemd oneshot service. Within anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes after this command finishes, we see a spike in system CPU. Viewing <code>htop</code> will confirm this (press <code>shift + k</code> to show kernel threads in <code>htop</code>) – we see kernel workers using lots of CPU in the function <code>inode_switch_wbs</code>.</p>

<p>The initial release of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html">cgroups</a>, known as cgroups v1, was in kernel version 2.6.24. Cgroups v1 has since been replaced by a new implementation: cgroups v2. Cgroups v2 was officially released in kernel version 4.5. Our old CentOS operating system used kernel version 3.10. We believe this inode switching CPU issue is related to the <code>io</code> and <code>memory</code> controllers introduced in cgroups v2. Thus CentOS, which uses cgroups v1, is not vulnerable to this issue.</p>

<p><a href="#is-it-writeback-no">Recall</a> that when we ran the <code>rsync</code> command from <code>setupwebroot</code> manually in our interactive shell, we saw no spike in system CPU. It turns out that each interactive ssh session you have open creates its own cgroup. Below is the output of <code>systemd-cgls</code> on a web server on which I have two interactive ssh sessions open. One session is running a <code>sleep 100</code> command, and the other session is running <code>systemd-cgls</code>.

<p>These <code>session-*.scope</code> cgroups stick around until you terminate your ssh session. After terminating your ssh session, systemd removes the corresponding cgroup. With this insight, we tested terminating the interactive ssh session after manually running the <code>rsync</code> commands. Sure enough, about 2 minutes after we terminated the ssh session, we saw the big spikes in system CPU caused by inode cgroup switching.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>This paper introduces an open-source benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks in dynamic video environments. We present a curated dataset containing 1,477 manually annotated frames spanning diverse domains, including code editors, news broadcasts, YouTube videos, and advertisements. Three state of the art VLMs - Claude-3, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o are benchmarked against traditional OCR systems such as EasyOCR and RapidOCR. Evaluation metrics include Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER), and Accuracy. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of VLMs in video-based OCR tasks, demonstrating their potential to outperform conventional OCR models in many scenarios. However, challenges such as hallucinations, content security policies, and sensitivity to occluded or stylized text remain. The dataset and benchmarking framework are publicly available to foster further research.

    <h2><a href="https://go.dev/blog/">The Go Blog</a></h2>
    

    
      
      
      
      <p>Go 1.24 enhances its WebAssembly (Wasm) capabilities with the
addition of the <code>go:wasmexport</code> directive and the ability to build a reactor
for WebAssembly System Interface (WASI).
These features enable Go developers to export Go functions to Wasm,
facilitating better integration with Wasm hosts and expanding the possibilities
for Go-based Wasm applications.</p>
<h2 id="webassembly-and-the-webassembly-system-interface">WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System Interface</h2>
<p><a href="https://webassembly.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">WebAssembly (Wasm)</a> is a binary instruction format
that was initially created for web browsers, providing the execution of
high-performance, low-level code at speeds approaching native performance.
Since then, Wasm’s utility has expanded, and it is now used in various
environments beyond the browser.
Notably, cloud providers offer services that directly execute Wasm
executables, taking advantage of the
<a href="https://wasi.dev/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)</a> system call API.
WASI allows these executables to interact with system resources.</p>
<p>Go first added support for compiling to Wasm in the 1.11 release, through the
<code>js/wasm</code> port.
Go 1.21 added a new port targeting the WASI preview 1 syscall API through the
new <code>GOOS=wasip1</code> port.</p>
<h2 id="exporting-go-functions-to-wasm-with-gowasmexport">Exporting Go Functions to Wasm with <code>go:wasmexport</code></h2>
<p>Go 1.24 introduces a new compiler directive, <code>go:wasmexport</code>, which allows
developers to export Go functions to be called from outside of the
Wasm module, typically from a host application that runs the Wasm runtime.
This directive instructs the compiler to make the annotated function available
as a Wasm <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/valid/modules.html?highlight=export#exports" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">export</a>
in the resulting Wasm binary.</p>
<p>To use the <code>go:wasmexport</code> directive, simply add it to a function definition:</p>
<pre><code>//go:wasmexport add
func add(a, b int32) int32 { return a + b }
</code></pre>
<p>With this, the Wasm module will have an exported function named <code>add</code> that
can be called from the host.</p>
<p>This is analogous to the <a href="https://go.dev/cmd/cgo#hdr-C_references_to_Go">cgo <code>export</code> directive</a>,
which makes the function available to be called from C,
though <code>go:wasmexport</code> uses a different, simpler mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-wasi-reactor">Building a WASI Reactor</h2>
<p>A WASI reactor is a WebAssembly module that operates continuously, and
can be called upon multiple times to react on events or requests.
Unlike a “command” module, which terminates after its main function finishes,
a reactor instance remains live after initialization, and its exports remain
accessible.</p>
<p>With Go 1.24, one can build a WASI reactor with the <code>-buildmode=c-shared</code> build
flag.</p>
<pre><code>$ GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -buildmode=c-shared -o reactor.wasm
</code></pre>
<p>The build flag signals to the linker not to generate the <code>_start</code> function
(the entry point for a command module), and instead generate an
<code>_initialize</code> function, which performs runtime and package initialization,
along with any exported functions and their dependencies.
The <code>_initialize</code> function must be called before any other exported functions.
The <code>main</code> function will not be automatically invoked.</p>
<p>To use a WASI reactor, the host application first initializes it by calling
<code>_initialize</code>, then simply invoke the exported functions.
Here is an example using <a href="https://wazero.io/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Wazero</a>, a Go-based Wasm runtime
implementation:</p>
<pre><code>// Create a Wasm runtime, set up WASI.
r := wazero.NewRuntime(ctx)
defer r.Close(ctx)
wasi_snapshot_preview1.MustInstantiate(ctx, r)

// Configure the module to initialize the reactor.
config := wazero.NewModuleConfig().WithStartFunctions("_initialize")

// Instantiate the module.
wasmModule, _ := r.InstantiateWithConfig(ctx, wasmFile, config)

// Call the exported function.
fn := wasmModule.ExportedFunction("add")
var a, b int32 = 1, 2
res, _ := fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(a), api.EncodeI32(b))
c := api.DecodeI32(res[0])
fmt.Printf("add(%d, %d) = %d\n", a, b, c)

// The instance is still alive. We can call the function again.
res, _ = fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(b), api.EncodeI32(c))
fmt.Printf("add(%d, %d) = %d\n", b, c, api.DecodeI32(res[0]))
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>go:wasmexport</code> directive and the reactor build mode allow applications to
be extended by calling into Go-based Wasm code.
This is particularly valuable for applications that have adopted Wasm as a
plugin or extension mechanism with well-defined interfaces.
By exporting Go functions, applications can leverage the Go Wasm modules to
provide functionality without needing to recompile the entire application.
Furthermore, building as a reactor ensures that the exported functions can be
called multiple times without requiring reinitialization, making it suitable
for long-running applications or services.</p>
<h2 id="supporting-rich-types-between-the-host-and-the-client">Supporting rich types between the host and the client</h2>
<p>Go 1.24 also relaxes the constraints on types that can be used as input and
result parameters with <code>go:wasmimport</code> functions.
For example, one can pass a bool, a string, a pointer to an <code>int32</code>, or a
pointer to a struct which embeds <code>structs.HostLayout</code> and contains supported
field types
(see the <a href="https://go.dev/cmd/compile#hdr-WebAssembly_Directives">documentation</a> for detail).
This allows Go Wasm applications to be written in a more natural and ergonomic
way, and removes some unnecessary type conversions.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>While Go 1.24 has made significant enhancements to its Wasm capabilities,
there are still some notable limitations.</p>
<p>Wasm is a single-threaded architecture with no parallelism.
A <code>go:wasmexport</code> function can spawn new goroutines.
But if a function creates a background goroutine, it will not continue
executing when the <code>go:wasmexport</code> function returns, until calling back into
the Go-based Wasm module.</p>
<p>While some type restrictions have been relaxed in Go 1.24, there are still
limitations on the types that can be used with <code>go:wasmimport</code> and
<code>go:wasmexport</code> functions.
Due to the unfortunate mismatch between the 64-bit architecture of the client
and the 32-bit architecture of the host, it is not possible to pass pointers in
memory.
For example, a <code>go:wasmimport</code> function cannot take a pointer to a struct that
contains a pointer-typed field.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The addition of the ability to build a WASI reactor and export Go functions to
Wasm in Go 1.24 represent a significant step forward for Go’s WebAssembly
capabilities.
These features empower developers to create more versatile and powerful Go-based
Wasm applications, opening up new possibilities for Go in the Wasm ecosystem.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Zed is built for speed. We've always strived for an editing experience that feels <em>instant</em>. But what's faster than instant?  A tool that anticipates your next move. That's why we're introducing <a href="https://zed.dev/edit-prediction">edit prediction</a> in Zed, powered by <a href="https://huggingface.co/zed-industries/zeta">Zeta</a>, our new open source model.</p>
<p>Here's a quick walkthrough:</p>
<p><figure><video src="https://customer-snccc0j9v3kfzkif.cloudflarestream.com/32e5feacc10b8e63292918b21e9ae15c/downloads/default.mp4" width="640" height="360" controls=""></video><figcaption>Edit Prediction in action.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>As you work, Zed now predicts your next edit, so you can apply it just by hitting <code>tab</code>. Once you accept a prediction, you can perform multiple follow-up edits by pressing <code>tab</code> repeatedly, saving you time and keystrokes. We've received <em>a ton</em> of requests for this functionality, and we've poured our hearts into making it feel like a natural extension of the Zed experience.</p>
<p>You can use Zeta for free during this public beta by <a href="https://zed.dev/download">downloading Zed</a> and signing in with your GitHub account. Edit prediction won't be free forever, but right now we're just excited to share and learn.</p>
<h2 id="thoughtful-integration"><a href="#thoughtful-integration" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Thoughtful Integration</span></a></h2>
<p>Edit prediction transforms <code>tab</code> into a magical, universal key. But what about the existing uses of <code>tab</code>, such as indenting lines? And what happens when there's both an edit prediction <em>and</em> suggestions from your language server? We didn't want a powerful new feature to come at the expense of the existing editing experience in Zed.</p>
<p><figure><video loop="" muted="" autoplay="" preload="metadata" controls="" playsinline=""><source src="https://customer-snccc0j9v3kfzkif.cloudflarestream.com/4f9b29a42d9bfa64e5457dec716f59be/downloads/default.mp4" type="video/webm; codecs=&quot;vp8.0, vorbis&quot;"><source src="https://customer-snccc0j9v3kfzkif.cloudflarestream.com/4f9b29a42d9bfa64e5457dec716f59be/downloads/default.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.4D401E, mp4a.40.2&quot;"></video><figcaption>Zeta predictions together with language server completions.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>When language server completions are visible, Zed won't preview the predicted edit until you press <code>option</code> or <code>alt</code>. As soon as you press the modifier, Zed previews the edit and hides the menu to enable an unobstructed review. On macOS, you can just hit <code>tab</code> to confirm, or back out by releasing <code>option</code> to restore the language server completions menu.</p>
<p>On Linux, <code>alt-tab</code> is often reserved by the window manager, so we offer <code>alt-l</code> as an alternative default. We chose <code>l</code> because it's on the QWERTY home row and represents rightward movement in Vim. If your Linux window manager doesn't claim <code>alt-tab</code>, you're free to use that binding as well.</p>

<p>Most coding models are trained on a "fill in the middle" task. You give them a prefix and a suffix, and they generate what goes in between.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre><code data-language="rs" data-theme="dark-plus light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>&lt;|</span><span>fim_prefix</span><span>|&gt;</span><span>fn</span><span> quicksort</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> [</span><span>T</span><span>]) {</span></span>

<p>This works for completing text at the cursor, but we wanted Zeta to predict edits at arbitrary locations, which doesn't fit into this structure.</p>
<p>In our experience, models aren't very good at producing granular edits, but they do excel at rewriting larger chunks of code. So that's where we started: given a list of recent edits and the cursor position, we asked the model to rewrite a snippet of text around the cursor, incorporating one or more edit predictions in the rewritten text.</p>
<h3 id="evaluating-predictions"><a href="#evaluating-predictions" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Evaluating Predictions</span></a></h3>
<p>Before writing a single line of code, we created a set of tests to check if our idea worked. Testing the output of a large language model is tricky because, on every run, you can get slightly different results even when feeding it the exact same input. This can be mitigated by using a temperature of <code>0</code> and, for providers that support it, providing a seed for the RNG.</p>
<p>That said, code can often be written in many different but equally valid ways. So even when Zeta's output differs from our expected answer, it might still be doing exactly what we want—just taking a different path to get there. This makes traditional unit testing approaches particularly challenging when working with LLMs.</p>
<p>This led us to take a different approach—instead of strict assertions, we used a larger LLM to evaluate Zeta's edits. By writing our test assertions in plain English and having Claude check if the results matched our intent, we could validate that Zeta was making sensible edits, even when its exact output differed between runs. This ended up being much more practical than trying to make brittle assertions about specific tokens.</p>
<p>Here's an example taken from our eval suite:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre><code data-language="rs" data-theme="dark-plus light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>// Input:</span></span>

<p>We took our first stab at making those tests pass by using Qwen2.5-Coder-32B and giving it clear instructions for which types of edits we wanted it to predict. <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/79a70b72b3968d102c6171f8bd2738ec7be8e94f/crates/zeta/src/complete_prompt.md">Here's the initial system prompt</a> we used and you can look through the history to see how we kept changing it to pass the eval suite.</p>
<p>This worked out surprisingly well for the first 4-5 evals. However, as soon as we introduced more, we started noticing that it got harder and harder to pass them all consistently. Changing the prompt caused the new evals to pass, but made the old ones fail. Overall, it felt like a flaky process and we didn't feel confident this would lead to the system being robust enough to be used in production.</p>
<p>Moreover, using a 32b model wasn't really compatible with our strict latency requirements (more on that later).</p>
<h3 id="supervised-fine-tuning"><a href="#supervised-fine-tuning" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Supervised Fine-Tuning</span></a></h3>
<p>After playing around with different approaches, we decided to go with supervised fine-tuning using <a href="https://unsloth.ai/">Unsloth</a> and LoRA. The idea was to teach Zeta two key things: figuring out what changes a developer might want next based on their recent edits, and then actually applying those changes cleanly to the code without introducing weird side effects.</p>
<p>But we had a classic chicken-and-egg problem—we needed data to train the model, but we didn't have any real examples yet. So we started by having Claude generate about 50 synthetic examples that we added to <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/zed-industries/zeta-dataset">our dataset</a>. We then used that initial fine-tune to ship an early version of Zeta behind a feature flag and started collecting examples from our own team's usage.</p>
<p>This approach let us quickly build up a solid dataset of around 400 high-quality examples, which improved the model a lot! However, we kept running into edge cases that would trip the model up. The most annoying ones were when Zeta was working with a small piece of code in a larger file—it would sometimes get confused and make random deletions or insertions that had nothing to do with what the user was trying to do, and it didn't seem like adding more examples steered the model away from those mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="direct-preference-optimization"><a href="#direct-preference-optimization" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Direct Preference Optimization</span></a></h3>
<p>To handle these edge cases, we conducted another pass using direct preference optimization (DPO). This technique let us go beyond simply showing the model what good edits look like—we could also teach it what edits <em>to avoid</em>. With DPO, we could fine-tune Zeta by providing both positive and negative examples, helping it learn the subtle differences between helpful and problematic edits.</p>
<p>We found that just ~150 carefully selected examples were enough to significantly improve Zeta's behavior on tricky cases. Of course, we think we can make it even better by expanding our training data with more diverse examples, and we're excited to keep pushing the boundaries here.</p>
<h3 id="minimizing-latency-speculative-decoding"><a href="#minimizing-latency-speculative-decoding" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Minimizing Latency: Speculative Decoding</span></a></h3>
<p>Like every feature in Zed, latency was a critical factor for edit prediction. When we started, we set aggressive performance targets: predictions should be delivered in under 200ms for the median case (p50) and under 500ms for the 90th percentile (p90). The challenge was that rewriting complete excerpts, while enabling multi-location edits, requires generating significantly more tokens than simple fill-in-middle approaches. Initially, this put us way over our latency budget.</p>
<p>However, there's a fascinating insight about how edit predictions work. When we rewrite a text snippet, the output often mirrors the input closely, with changes concentrated in specific spots. This pattern lets us parallelize token generation by using the input as a reference—a technique known as speculative decoding. We use n-gram search to identify promising jumping-off points in the input where we can start parallel token generation, giving us a significant speedup without sacrificing quality.</p>
<h3 id="minimizing-latency-serving-the-model"><a href="#minimizing-latency-serving-the-model" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Minimizing Latency: Serving The Model</span></a></h3>
<p>For edit predictions to feel responsive, we needed to solve multiple latency challenges in parallel. As discussed above, we tackled the model execution time through speculative decoding, but serving the model at scale presented its own set of hurdles. This was by far the most compute-intensive problem our team has ever tackled.</p>
<p>A few weeks out from launch, we ran a brief competitive process, and we ended up being really impressed with <a href="https://www.baseten.co/">Baseten</a>. Their performance engineers quickly optimized our open source model to run on their flexible infrastructure, achieving our target latencies while letting us retain full visibility into the details of the deployment, both for the Zed team and the entire Zed community. We plan to follow up with a guest post about what they learned optimizing <a href="https://huggingface.co/zed-industries/zeta">our model</a>.</p>
<p>Latency is not just a function of compute; network transit time is a key driver of perceived speed. To cooperate with the laws of physics, we're launching with GPUs in both North America and Europe, and we hope to add more regions soon. We're also using <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a> to handle your requests in a data center located as close to you as possible.</p>

<p>There's plenty more to explore to make edit predictions more powerful. We'll be fast-following with more experiments. We plan on sending more kinds of context to the model and continuing our experiments with fine-tuning, and we'll share updates as we grow and evolve the Zeta dataset.</p>
<p>We've learned a lot since we launched Zed AI last fall. The world is changing fast, and we're having a blast exploring and learning to build features that developers love. We're also excited to build with AI the Zed way. From our early days, we've been proponents of an open approach to building software, even when hard, and we see no reason to change that approach when it comes to working with AI. We hope you'll join us as a user, a contributor, or an employee, as we hustle to ship a golden future.</p><hr></article></div>]]></description>

<p>
There's an interesting theory out there that X causes Y. If this were true, it would be pretty important. So I did a deep-dive into the academic literature on whether X causes Y. Here's what I found.
</p>
<p>
(Embarrassingly, I can't actually remember what X and Y are. I think maybe X was enriched preschool, or just school itself, or eating fish while pregnant, or the Paleo diet, or lead exposure, or a clever "nudge" policy trying to get people to save more, or some self-help technique, or some micronutrient or public health intervention, or democracy, or free trade, or some approach to intellectual property law. And Y was ... lifetime earnings, or risk of ADHD diagnosis, or IQ in adulthood, or weight loss, or violent crime, or peaceful foreign policy, or GDP per capita, or innovation. Sorry about that! Hope you enjoy the post anyway! Fortunately, I think <strong>what I'm about to write is correct for pretty much any (X,Y) from those sorts of lists.</strong>)
</p>
<p>
In brief:
</p>
<ul>

<li>There are hundreds of studies on whether X causes Y, but most of them are simple observational studies that are just essentially saying "People/countries with more X also have more Y." For reasons discussed below, we can't really learn much from these studies.

</li><li>There are 1-5 more interesting studies on whether X causes Y. Each study looks really clever, informative and rigorous at first glance. However, the more closely you look at them, the more confusing the picture gets.

</li><li>We ultimately need to choose between (a) believing some overly complicated theory of the relationship between X and Y, which reconciles all of the wildly conflicting and often implausible things we're seeing in the studies; (b) more-or-less reverting to what we would've guessed about the relationship between X and Y in the absence of any research.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-chaff">The chaff: lots of unhelpful studies that I'm disregarding</h2>


<p>
First, the good news: there are hundreds of studies on whether X causes Y. The bad news? We need to throw most of them out. 
</p>
<p>
Many have comically small sample sizes (like studying 20 people) and/or comically short time horizons (like looking at weight loss over two weeks),<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> or unhelpful outcome measures (like intelligence tests in children under 5).<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> But by far the most common problem is that <strong>most of the studies on whether X causes Y are simple observational studies: they essentially just find that people/countries with more X also have more Y. </strong>
</p>
<p>
Why is this a problem? There could be a <em>confounder</em> - some third thing, Z, that is correlated with both X and Y. And there are specific reasons we should expect confounders to be common:
</p>
<ul>

<li>In general, people/countries that have more X also have more of lots of other helpful things - they're richer, they're more educated, etc. For example, if we're asking whether higher-quality schooling leads to higher earnings down the line, an issue is that people with higher-quality schooling also tend to come from better-off families with lots of other advantages.

</li><li>In fact, the <em>very fact that people in upper-class intellectual circles think X causes Y</em> means that richer, more educated people/countries tend to deliberately get more X, and also try to do a lot of other things to get more Y. For example, more educated families tend to eat more fish (complicating the attempt to see whether eating fish in pregnancy is good for the baby).<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>
Now, a lot of these studies try to "control for" the problem I just stated - they say things like "We examined the effect of X and Y, while controlling for Z [e.g., how wealthy or educated the people/countries/whatever are]." How do they do this? The short answer is, well, hm, jeez. Well you see, to simplify matters a bit, just try to imagine ... uh ... shit. Uh. The only high-level way I can put this is:
</p>
<ul>

<li>They use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression analysis</a> that, as far as I can determine, cannot be explained in a simple, intuitive way (especially not in terms of how it "controls for" confounders).

</li><li>The "controlling for" thing relies on a lot of subtle assumptions and can break in all kinds of weird ways. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152719">Here's </a>a technical explanation of some of the pitfalls; <a href="https://www.cold-takes.com/phil-birnbaums-regression-analysis/">here's</a> a set of deconstructions of regressions that break in weird ways.

</li><li>None of the observational studies about whether X causes Y discuss the pitfalls of "controlling for" things and whether they apply here.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I don't think we can trust these papers, and to really pick them all apart (given how many there are) would take too much time. So let's focus on a smaller number of better studies.
</p>
<h2 id="the-wheat">The wheat: 1-5 more interesting studies</h2>


<p>
Digging through the sea of unhelpful studies, I found 1-5 of them that are actually really interesting! 
</p>
<p>
For example, one study examines some strange historical event you've never heard of (perhaps a <a href="https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/mariel-impact.pdf">surge in Cuban emigration triggered by Fidel Castro suddenly allowing it</a>, or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3800113/">John Rockefeller's decision to fund a hookworm eradication campaign</a>, or a <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.6.2437">sudden collective pardon leading to release of a third of prison inmates in Italy</a>), where for abstruse and idiosyncratic reasons, X got distributed in what seems to be almost a random way. This study is really clever, and the authors were incredibly thorough in examining seemingly every way their results could have been wrong. They conclude that X causes Y!
</p>
<p>
But on closer inspection, I have a bunch of reservations. For example:
</p>
<ul>

<li>The paper doesn't make it easy to replicate its analysis, and when someone does manage to sort-of replicate it, they may <a href="https://blog.givewell.org/2017/12/07/questioning-evidence-hookworm-eradication-american-south/">get different results</a>. 

</li><li>There was other weird stuff going on (e.g., changes in census data collection methods<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>), during the strange historical event, so it's a little hard to generalize.

</li><li>In a response to the study, another academic advances a complex theory of how the study could actually have gotten a misleading result. This led to an intense back-and-forth between the original authors and the skeptic, stretched out over years because each response had to be published in a journal, and by the time I got to the end of it I didn't have any idea what to think anymore.<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>
I found 0-4 other interesting studies. I can't remember all of the details, but they may have included:
</p>
<ul>

<li>A study comparing siblings, or maybe "very similar countries," that got more or less of X.<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>

</li><li>A study using a complex mathematical technique claiming to cleanly isolate the effect of X and Y. I can't really follow what it's doing, and I’m guessing there are a lot of weird assumptions baked into this analysis.<sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>

</li><li>A study with actual randomization: some people were randomly assigned to receive more X than others, and the researchers looked at who ended up with more Y. This sounds awesome! However, there are issues here too: 
<ul>
 
<li>It's kind of ambiguous whether the assignment to X was really "random."<sup id="fnref9"><a href="#fn9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>
 
</li><li>Extremely weird things happened during the study (for example, <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming/reanalysis#Our_initial_reservations">generational levels of flooding</a>), so it's not clear how well it generalizes to other settings.
 
</li><li>The result seems fragile (<a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming#Other_studies_of_long-term_effects">simply adding more data weakens it a lot</a>) and/or just hard to believe (like <a href="https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-017-0287-9">schoolchildren doing noticeably better on a cognition test after a few weeks of being given fish instead of meat with their lunch, even though they mostly didn't eat the fish</a>). </li></ul></li></ul>
<p>
Compounding the problem, the 1-5 studies I found tell very different stories about the relationship between X and Y. How could this make sense? Is there a unified theory that can reconcile all the results?
</p>
<p>
Well, one possibility is that X causes Y sometimes, but only under very particular conditions, and the effect can be masked by some other thing going on. So - if you meet one of 7 criteria, you should do X to get more Y, but if you meet one of 9 other criteria, you should actually avoid X!
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>


<p>
I have to say, this all was simultaneously more fascinating and less <em>informative</em> than I expected it would be going in. I thought I would find some nice studies about the relationship between X and Y and be done. Instead, I've learned a ton about weird historical events and about the ins and outs of different measures of X and Y, but I feel just super confused about whether X causes Y.
</p>
<p>
I guess my bottom line is that X does cause Y, because it intuitively seems like it would.
</p>
<p>
I'm glad I did all this research, though. It's good to know that social science research can go haywire in all kinds of strange ways. And it's good to know that despite the confident proclamations of pro- and anti-X people, it's legitimately just super unclear whether X causes Y. 
</p>
<p>
I mean, how else could I have learned that?
</p>
<h2 id="appendix">Appendix: based on a true story</h2>


<p>
This piece was inspired by:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Most evidence reviews GiveWell has done, especially of <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming">deworming</a>

</li><li>Many evidence reviews by David Roodman, particularly <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/publication/macro-aid-effectiveness-research-guide-perplexed-working-paper-135">Macro Aid Effectiveness Research: a Guide for the Perplexed</a>; <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0095V3J0S/">Due Diligence: an Impertinent Inquiry into Microfinance</a>; and <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reasonable-doubt-new-look-whether-prison-growth-cuts-crime">Reasonable Doubt: A New Look at Whether Prison Growth Cuts Crime</a>. 

</li><li>Many evidence reviews by Slate Star Codex, collected <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/tag/much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/">here</a>.

</li><li>Informal evidence reviews I've done for e.g. personal medical decisions.
</li></ul>
<p>
The basic patterns above apply to most of these, and the bottom line usually has the kind of frustrating ambiguity seen in this conclusion.</p>
    
<p>There are cases where things seem a bit less ambiguous and the bottom line seems clearer. Speaking broadly, I think the main things that contribute to this are:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Actual randomization. For years I've nodded along when people say "You shouldn't be dogmatic about randomization, there are many ways for a study to be informative," but each year I've become a bit more dogmatic. Even the most sophisticated-, appealing-seeming alternatives to randomization in studies seem to have a way of falling apart. Randomized studies almost always have problems and drawbacks too. But I’d rather have a randomized study with drawbacks than a non-randomized study with drawbacks.

</li><li>Extreme thoroughness, such as Roodman's attempt to reconstruct the data and code for key studies in <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reasonable-doubt-new-look-whether-prison-growth-cuts-crime">Reasonable Doubt</a>. This sometimes leads to outright dismissing a number of studies, leaving a smaller, more consistent set remaining.
</li>
</ul>
