<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>When Mitchell and I founded HashiCorp, we made the decision to make our products open source because of a few key beliefs:</p>
<ul>
<li>We believe strongly in freely available source code to make it easy for practitioners to freely download, inspect source code, and solve their own problems.</li>
<li>We believe in building an ecosystem and community around our products to enable broad integrations.</li>
<li>We believe in the importance of transparency for our users.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more than a decade, we’ve continued to build new products and features provided to the community under a free open source license. This has led to a large community of users, contributors, partners, and customers who participate in and benefit from the work on the HashiCorp products.</p>
<p>Our open source model has been made possible by the thousands of commercial customers who partner with us on their mission-critical infrastructure. We invest tens of millions of dollars in research and development in our open source products annually, and our commercial efforts enable us to continue to support, and sponsor, our vibrant community of users.</p>
<p>Our approach has enabled us to partner closely with the cloud providers to enable tight integration for our joint users and customers, as well as hundreds of other technology partners we work closely with. However, there are other vendors who take advantage of pure OSS models, and the community work on OSS projects, for their own commercial goals, without providing material contributions back. We don’t believe this is in the spirit of open source.</p>
<p>As a result, we believe commercial open source models need to evolve for the ecosystem to continue providing open, freely available software. Open source has reduced the barrier to copying innovation and selling it through existing distribution channels. Many vendors have shifted increasingly to closed source for this reason, however we did not feel that would preserve our original goals in adopting open source.</p>
<p>That is why today we are announcing that HashiCorp is changing its source code license from Mozilla Public License v2.0 (MPL 2.0) to the Business Source License (BSL, also known as BUSL) v1.1 on all future releases of HashiCorp products. HashiCorp APIs, SDKs, and almost all other libraries will remain MPL 2.0.</p>
<p>BSL 1.1 is a source-available license that allows copying, modification, redistribution, non-commercial use, and commercial use under specific conditions. With this change we are following a path similar to other companies in recent years. These companies include Couchbase, Cockroach Labs, Sentry, and MariaDB, which developed this license in 2013. Companies including Confluent, MongoDB, Elastic, Redis Labs, and others have also adopted alternative licenses that include restrictions on commercial usage. In all these cases, the license enables the commercial sponsor to have more control around commercialization.</p>
<p>Our implementation of BSL includes additional usage grants that allow for broadly permissive use of our source code. We believe this will offer a fair and sustainable way for HashiCorp to share its source code widely, for free use. We consulted with OSS licensing experts and other industry stakeholders when developing our license, so that our efforts would be in line with industry practices.</p>
<p>Our first goal with this change is to minimize the impact to our community, partners, and customers. We will continue to publish source code and updates for HashiCorp products to our GitHub repository and distribution channels.</p>
<p>End users can continue to copy, modify, and redistribute the code for all non-commercial and commercial use, except where providing a competitive offering to HashiCorp. Partners can continue to build integrations for our joint customers. We will continue to work closely with the cloud service providers to ensure deep support for our mutual technologies. Customers of enterprise and cloud-managed HashiCorp products will see no change as well.</p>
<p>Vendors who provide competitive services built on our community products will no longer be able to incorporate future releases, bug fixes, or security patches contributed to our products.</p>
<p>Our commitment to our community, partners, and customers has not changed. We understand the trust the community places in us and we’ve worked carefully to preserve our original goals in adopting an open approach. We look forward to continuing to invest in the community and our products.</p>
<p>We know there will be additional questions, and we’ve assembled a set of <a href="https://hashi.co/license-faq">frequently asked questions</a> to help you better understand the changes. You can also watch the short video below for more information:</p></section></div></div>]]></description>

      <p><i>August 2023</i>
      </p>

      <p>Bram is one of my heroes. That’s literal and recursive: when I say it,
internally I check before making a frivolous claim, which is a feature of this
particular role-model; “What would Bram do?” is a fixture in me which informs my
choices.</p>

<p>Those who studied <code>vim_dev</code> and the Vim source and docs, accumulated treasure
from a stream of copious messages and spare impressions. But also from what he
omitted: he never appealed to sensationalism or personal judgements.</p>

<p>Even when treated rudely, Bram usually responded only to advance his
understanding of a problem to solve. Bram was one of those humans quietly
providing deep value to the universe, but there was no parade and little
celebrity.</p>

<p>Bram was anchored to reality, directly interested in results and adjusting what
produced them. The “Problem/Solution” mantra in his commit messages is simple
yet profoundly effective. He used that approach to help <a href="https://www.moolenaar.net/albums.html">people in
Uganda</a>, managing resources directly
instead of abstractly.</p>

<p>Bram’s principles (as I observed them) extended beyond mere technical
craftsmanship. The ability to adopt a position of <em>modesty</em> is a mind-trick that
channels an endeavor through a “narrow waist”, a voluntary constraint. That lens
can create a more composable and powerful result. Plugins like
<a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired">unimpaired</a> riff on the theme. And
this touches on a central point: the main utility—not ideology, but <em>utility</em>—of
“lifestyle software” like Emacs and Vim, is that the ecosystem is alive, and has
escape velocity, so its momentum is self-perpetuated.</p>

<p>Neovim has always been intentionally positioned as a derivative of Vim, which
means simultaneously it both continues and diverges from Vim. I’m convinced that
<a href="https://twitter.com/justinmk/status/1671916719143526400">forks create energy</a>
rather than destroy it. So although we can’t deliver Vim without Bram, we can
continue some essential parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/develop.html#design-maintain">Maintenance</a>:
Experimentation is good, and the world needs creative destruction and playful
failures. But Neovim does not represent lust for the new (“neomania”).</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/develop.html#design-documented">Documentation</a>:
the habits of Vim documentation are obvious, this is one of the biggest gains
that Nvim acquired by building on vim.</li>
  <li>Extensibility: Bram’s own <a href="http://www.agide.org/">Agide</a> project aspired to
a similar sort of extensibility as Neovim:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Agide is not a monolitic application. Separate tools can be plugged in. Thus
you are not forced to use one editor. … Each tool implements part of the
plugin interface.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
<a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/develop.html#design-not">Embedding</a>: Vim’s
<a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/531da5955e03afadb2f0cf72264fe8deb4bf430e/runtime/doc/develop.txt#L145-L153">:help design-not</a>
for most of its life proclaimed this tenet of Neovim:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Vim is not a shell or an Operating System. …  This should work the other way
around: Use Vim as a component from a shell or in an IDE.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And another thing: Bram didn’t take himself too seriously. He had his own sense
of humor.</p>

<p>Neovim is a monument to Vim and Bram. We should be pragmatic, not dogmatic; we
should remember what the goal is, and compare our actions to the results.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>RENO, Nev., AUSTIN, Texas, and LUXEMBOURG</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>CIQ, Oracle and SUSE today announced their intent to form the <a href="https://openela.org/">Open Enterprise Linux Association (OpenELA)</a>, a collaborative trade association to encourage the development of distributions compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) by providing open and free Enterprise Linux (EL) source code.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The formation of OpenELA arises from Red Hat’s recent changes to RHEL source code availability</span></span></span><span><span>. In response, CIQ, Oracle and SUSE are collaborating to deliver source code, tools and </span></span><span>systems through OpenELA for the community.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“Collaboration is critical to fostering innovation, which is why we welcome everyone to be part of this association and help us uphold open community standards,” said Thomas Di Giacomo, chief technology and product officer of SUSE. “SUSE is a strong believer in making choice happen. Together with the open source community we will redefine what it truly means to be open and deliver a stronger future for EL.”&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“Today's announcement marks the beginning of a new era for EL,” said Gregory Kurtzer, CEO of CIQ. “With OpenELA, CIQ, Oracle and SUSE join forces with the open source community to ensure a stable and resilient future for both upstream and downstream communities to leverage Enterprise Linux."</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“Many large organizations reached out to us to express the importance of community-driven source code for EL that can act as a starting point for compatible distributions,” said </span></span></span><span>Wim Coekaerts, head of Oracle Linux development, Oracle. “</span><span>OpenELA is our response to this need, and it represents a commitment to helping the open source community continue to develop compatible EL distributions.”</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Starting later this year, OpenELA will provide sources necessary for downstreams compatible with RHEL to exist, with initial focus on RHEL versions EL8, EL9 and possibly EL7. The project is committed to ensuring the continued availability of OpenELA sources to the community indefinitely.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>OpenELA's core tenets, reflecting the spirit of the project, include full compliance with this existing standard, swift updates and secure fixes, transparency, community, and ensuring the resource remains free and redistributable for all.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>By welcoming other organizations and community members to join and contribute actively, OpenELA seeks to build a robust, community-driven standard that ensures impartiality and equilibrium in the EL ecosystem.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Here’s a rant from my <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/?s=tyrone">evil twin</a> Tyromight, which I publish without endorsement as it appears to be an unhinged polemic with no constructive solutions.</p>

<hr>

<p>Say that when people apply for their first driver’s license, 1% get Executive Platinum licenses. For life, they get free use of toll roads and can drive 20% over the speed limit. People argue—<em>fiercely</em> argue—if these should be awarded based on the written test, the driving test, or based on personal essays on <em>What Driving Means to Me</em>.</p>

<p>That would be weird, right?</p>

<p>Or say there’s a school. When kids enter as five-year-olds, the school deems 5% of them to be Gold Elites. They get special lunches and when they graduate as ten-year-olds, get preferred admission to competitive middle schools.</p>

<p>The question is not if Gold Elites should be chosen based on finger-painting or kickball competitions. The question is, why do they exist at all?</p>

<p>What would happen in schools if we lived in a magical dreamworld?</p>

<p>I think the answer is: Each kid gets whatever experiences maximize their potential.</p>

<p>That’s not controversial, is it? <em>Ideally</em>, they’d learn whatever subjects, in whatever style would best help them flourish into rich, happy, successful adults. Alice might spend her first few years in immersive Czech-language math classes and postpone history and science until she’s older. Bob might study everything in parallel with teachers that use puppetry and interpretive dance.</p>

<p>Picture each student as a dot in the space of possible experiences.</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/harvard/experiences1small.svg" alt="student dots"></p>

<p>In the real world, there are only so many teachers and classrooms. So perhaps it’s necessary to carve up the space of experiences and create one class for each chunk.</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/harvard/experiences2small.svg" alt="student dots partitioned"></p>

<p>(Really, it’s harder than this picture suggests, because many experiences are based on other students. If I want you as my project partner but you want to forget I exist, then something has to give.)</p>

<p>So there are tough questions. What classes should exist? Where do you put the best teachers? Should there be a “gifted” program? Most people acknowledge some tension between what’s best for the “top” students and everyone else. Opinions differ on how to resolve that tension, ranging from “top students in best classrooms with best teachers” to “all students together, with faster students helping others”.</p>

<p>But we agree on the <em>ideal</em>, right? In dreamworld, every kid would follow their own path. There would be no “advanced classes” or “tracks” because those concepts wouldn’t exist.</p>

<p>Now, this dreamworld school would not be a rainbow utopia where all students emerge equal. It’s plausible there would be <em>more</em> variance in outcomes than we have now. But we should still do it if we could.</p>

<p>So if that’s the ideal, then what’s wrong with giving 5% of kids Gold Elite status? Well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It’s decided by a committee, not something that emerges organically.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you <em>must</em> have Gold Elites (why?) you should pick them when they are <em>graduating</em>, not when they start.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If someone’s going to make Gold Elites, it damn well shouldn’t be the government or a tax-exempt nonprofit.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That’s pretty much what’s wrong with Harvard. (And high-stakes college admissions in general).</p>

<h2 id="problem-1-gating-mechanisms-are-bad">Problem #1: Gating mechanisms are bad</h2>

<p>In the limit, this is obvious. Imagine a society in which 18-year olds are assessed and then assigned to different career bands. “Alphas” could be senators or CEOs, while “gammas” could pursue dreams of carrying heavy rocks or carrying heavy pieces of wood. It doesn’t matter how the assessment is done, the idea is dystopic.</p>

<p>College isn’t nearly that consequential. But still, the effect of high-stakes college admissions is to make society a bit more like that.</p>

<p>I think that’s bad because I’ve internalized Western individualist values. (Haven’t you?) But there are practical reasons, too.</p>

<p>One is that when gates exist, the people who control them will put their fingers on the scales, creating all sorts of weird distortions and drama. (Witness: How college admissions currently creates all sorts of weird distortions and drama.)</p>

<p>But forget all that. The deeper reason is that <u>prediction is hard</u>.</p>

<p>Yes, grades and test scores and teacher evaluations are correlated with performance in college and beyond. But they are <em>only correlated</em>. When Carl Bernstein was a student at the University of Maryland, he was kicked off the school paper for bad grades. And yet, Carl Bernstein is extremely good at journalism.</p>

<p>Are there <em>any</em> criteria that would have identified what undergraduate Carl Bernstein was capable of? I doubt it. The only way to really know what a human can do is to let them try.</p>

<p>Yes, people will end up in different jobs somehow. But this should be a fluid process, not something controlled by any central authority. Your ability to become a famous journalist should be determined only by <em>how good you are at journalism</em>. Not by your grades or test scores or your ability to convince some committee of your <em>potential</em>.</p>

<p>And when gating functions exist, <em>cui bono</em>?</p>

<p>Well, who has parents to most help and support them in school? Who gets special tutors if they struggle? Who has school counselors trained to win the college admissions game? Who has the time and resources and connections to publish a book of nature photography or start a charity or volunteer in Guatemala or work in a cancer research lab?</p>

<p>We should have a Marxist version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s law</a>, something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a measure becomes a target, the privileged always find a way to win.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, I think it’s bizarre that so many people have decided that standardized tests must be eliminated since they favor the rich. <em>Everything</em> favors the rich, but surely an SAT-prep course does less than a personal-essay consultant.</p>

<p>But that misses the point. Standardized tests are not the solution. If you eliminate all advantages for privileged students, you’re still handing out gold stars for no reason. High-stake college admissions based on <em>any</em> criteria make society less meritocratic.</p>

<h2 id="problem-2-if-there-must-be-gating-mechanisms-they-should-come-as-late-as-possible">Problem #2: If there must be gating mechanisms, they should come as late as possible</h2>

<p>Sometimes you gotta gate.</p>

<p>If a war started tomorrow and everyone was drafted, then the military would have to choose who to train to fly fighter jets and who to train to repair submarines. There’s no getting around it. Aren’t colleges like that?</p>

<p>No. The plain truth is that different colleges mostly teach the same stuff.</p>

<p>Don’t believe me? See for yourself. Here are practice exams for first-semester calculus at <a href="https://people.math.harvard.edu/~knill/teaching/math1a2020/final/practice1.pdf">Harvard</a> and <a href="https://www.siue.edu/artsandsciences/math/pdf/final1_scan.pdf">Southern Illinois University Edwardsville</a>. I’d say Harvard’s questions are a <em>little</em> harder, and a little “better” (more fun, better reflect core concepts). But mostly the difference is <em>number of pictures of Harvard</em>.</p>

<p>But isn’t the typical student at Harvard better prepared for calculus? Surely that has some impact?</p>

<p>It does! It has a huge impact: At SIU Edwardsville, <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/dfr/2021/ReportPDF.aspx?unitId=149231">54%</a> of students graduate within 6 years. At Harvard, it’s <a href="https://college.harvard.edu/resources/faq/what-harvards-graduation-rate">98%</a>. Harvard does not do selective admissions so that it can push the most talented people to their limit.</p>

<p>The hardest part of Harvard is <em>getting in</em>. Do you think every legacy admit student athlete is a genius?</p>

<p>Say Alice wants to study math but she get rejected from Harvard so she goes to SIU Edwardsville. She struggles for a couple of semesters and then something clicks—she <em>gets</em> math and is at the top of the rest of her classes. She does a great research project and several professors say she’s the strongest undergrad to come through in years.</p>

<p>If Alice wants to be a professor, what are her odds of getting into a top program? (Of <em>course</em> a PhD from a top program is necessary to get a job as a professor!) The reality is: Low. Most PhD admissions committees will decide they don’t know what “strongest student at SIU” means, and pick someone “safer”.</p>

<p>If Alice wants to join the New York Times, or get a job at McKinsey, or go to a top law school so she could have a chance at the Supreme Court—same story. When Harvard rejected her, that made it harder for her to pass through <em>other</em> gating functions and many dreams became harder to reach.</p>

<p>High-stakes college admissions means that much of the value of a college degree is determined <em>before students even start college</em>. If you must mark and sort young people, gross, but OK. But why do it at 18 rather than 22? There’s no justification. No one even <em>suggests</em> a justification. Harvard just does it because it can.</p>

<h2 id="problem-3-gating-mechanisms-certainly-shouldnt-be-created-by-tax-exempt-nonprofits">Problem #3: Gating mechanisms certainly shouldn’t be created by tax-exempt nonprofits</h2>

<p>Some people say Harvard is a private institution and it can do what it wants. These people are wrong.</p>

<p>For one, companies can’t do whatever they want. Just try starting a restaurant that refuses entry to people over 50.</p>

<p>Anyway, private universities are <em>non-profits</em>. You can’t start a tax-exempt country club. If you could, then every business would be a non-profit and no one would pay taxes and the government would collapse.</p>

<p>When John Paulson donated $400 million to Harvard, that was <em>tax-deductible</em>. If we assume his marginal tax rate was 25%, that’s equivalent to him donating $300 million of after-tax money, and then having the government kick in an extra $100 million. Ivy-league universities also earn insane profits on endowments tax-free and are exempt from local property taxes.</p>

<p>Yes, I know Massachusetts has a weird system of passive-aggressive reduced-rate <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/assessing/payment-lieu-tax-pilot-program">“voluntary” taxes</a> and Harvard pays $4 million a year. Great! After 25 years, they’ll have repaid the subsidy on Paulson’s donation and can start working on the <em>billions</em> they earn each year from their endowment.</p>

<p>Harvard is clear about their educational mission. It is to create “citizen-leaders”.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s preposterous that they have legacy admissions and other criteria that might as well be designed to favor the rich. But even with the fairest possible admissions, Harvard would still be an organization <em>designed to reduce meritocracy</em>, one with the explicit goal of picking a subset of the population and labeling them as winners. And it would still do that while being subsidized by the rest of society.</p>

<p>When you argue about how it does admissions, you’re accepting the premise that it should exist at all. It only seems reasonable because we’ve been indoctrinated since birth with the idea that “Ivy League = prestige”, and humans are programmed to think prestigious things are good.</p>

<h2 id="does-this-matter">Does this matter?</h2>

<p>Everyone is talking about a <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Paper.pdf">recent paper</a> that looks at the impact of getting admitted to an Ivy+ (Ivy or similar) school. They looking at the ratios by which Ivy+ grads are represented in different groups relative to all college grads.</p>

<p>Of course, this isn’t causal. The people who get into Ivy+ schools are smart and rich and would do well no matter what. To estimate the <em>causal</em> impact, they compare two groups:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Those who were put on a waitlist to an Ivy+ school and eventually accepted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who were put on a waitlist to an Ivy+ school but not accepted.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>They make some statistical arguments that these groups are similar, so getting off the waitlist is effectively random. Comparing the two groups, here’s how much they find getting accepted increases your chances of various things.</p>

<p>Some point out that Ivy+ admission has little income on mean income rank, and suggest that none of this matters. To this, I have three counterarguments:</p>

<p>First, note—as most journalists did not—that “mean earnings rank” contains the word <em>rank</em>. Your rank is your position on a list of people sorted by incomes. This—unlike mean income—is insensitive to high earners. Roughly speaking, what this says is that for the <em>median person</em>, the causal effect of Ivy+ admissions on income is small.</p>

<p>Second, we don’t have causal estimates for things like becoming a CEO or working at the NYT or becoming a senator. But come on—the causal impacts are strongly correlated with Ivy+ over-representation. And Ivy+ grads are just as over-represented among Senators / NYT journalists / presidents as they are among people who go to elite grad schools.</p>

<p>Third, and most import: These causal estimates are for attending an Ivy+ school, <em>compared to attending a highly selective state school</em> like the University of Michigan. Michigan rejects 80% of applicants! Getting in there is still passing a very difficult gating function. This is all comparing a gold star to a slightly less shiny gold star. Imagine the impact versus places lower down the greasy pole.</p>

<p>Here’s my explanation for what’s happening:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Most people, even Ivy+ grads, end up in the world of normal jobs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That world is reasonably meritocratic. What matters is mostly your abilities, not your collection of gold stars. (At least, assuming you have  Michigan-tier gold star.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The “elite” world is an incestuous shell game.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Harvard <em>exists</em> to make society less meritocratic, and it does that while subsidized by everyone else. Give up. There’s a reasonable argument for putting the top <em>professors</em> together in one school, sure, and maybe even PhD students. But <em>undergraduates</em>? Please. We don’t need to sort and classify 18-year olds. It’s absurd. Stop trying to fix it and get rid of it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>They looked exactly as expected: a wall of white, peppered with black specks for smaller integers. “We expected the black dots to peter out,” Stange said. Rickards added, “I thought maybe it would even be possible to prove they peter out.” He speculated that by looking at charts that synthesized many packings together, the team would be able to prove results that weren’t possible when they looked at any one packing on its own.</p>
<p>While Stange was away, Haag wound up plotting every pair of remainders — about 120. No surprises there. Then she went big.</p>
<p>Haag had been plotting how 1,000 integers interact. (The graph is bigger than it sounds, since it involves 1 million possible pairs.) Then she cranked the dial up to 10,000 times 10,000. In one graph, regular rows and columns of black specks refused to dissolve. It looked nothing like what the local-global conjecture would predict.</p>
<p>The team met on a Monday after Stange returned. Haag presented her graphs, and they all focused on the one with the weird dots. “It was just a continual pattern,” Haag said. “And that was when Kate said, ‘What if the local-global conjecture isn’t true?’”</p>
<p>“This looks like a pattern. It has to continue. So the local-global conjecture must be false,” Stange recalled thinking. “James was more skeptical.”</p>
<p>“My first thought was there must be a bug in my code,” Rickards said. “I mean, that was the only reasonable thing I could think of.”</p>
<p>Within half a day, Rickards came around. The pattern ruled out all pairs where the first number is of the form 8 × (3<em>n</em> ± 1)<sup>2</sup> and the second is 24 times any square. This means 24 and 8 never appear in the same packing. Numbers you’d expect to occur don’t.</p>
<p>“I was kind of giddy. It’s not very often that something really surprises you,” Stange said. “But that’s the magic of playing with data.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02749">July paper</a> outlines a rigorous proof that the pattern they observed continues indefinitely, disproving the conjecture. The proof hinges on a centuries-old principle called quadratic reciprocity that involves the squares of two prime numbers. Stange’s team discovered how reciprocity applies to circle packings. It explains why certain curvatures can’t be tangent to each other. The rule, called an obstruction, propagates throughout the whole packing. “It’s just an entirely new thing,” said <a href="https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~lagarias/">Jeffrey Lagarias</a>, a mathematician at the University of Michigan who was a co-author on the 2003 circle-packing paper. “They’ve found it ingeniously,” Sarnak said. “If these numbers did appear, they would violate reciprocity.”</p>
<h2><strong>The Fallout</strong></h2>
<p>A number of other conjectures in number theory may now be in doubt. Like the local-global conjecture, they are hard to prove but have already been shown to hold for virtually all cases and are generally assumed to be true.</p>

<p>For example, Fuchs studies Markov triples, sets of numbers that satisfy the equation <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>y</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>z</em><sup>2</sup> = 3<em>xyz</em>. She and others have shown that certain types of solutions are connected for prime numbers greater than 10<sup>392</sup>. Everyone believes the pattern should continue to infinity. But in light of the new result, Fuchs has allowed herself to feel a twinge of doubt. “Maybe I’m missing something,” she said. “Maybe everyone’s missing something.”</p>
<p>“Now that we have a single example where it’s false, the question is: Is it false for these other examples too?” Rickards said.</p>
<p>There’s also Zaremba’s conjecture. It says that a fraction with any denominator can be expressed as a continued fraction that uses only the numbers between 1 and 5. In 2014, Kontorovich and Bourgain showed that Zaremba’s conjecture holds for almost all numbers. But the surprise about circle packing has undermined confidence in Zaremba’s conjecture.</p>
<p>If the packing problem is a harbinger of things to come, computational data may be the tool of its undoing.</p>
<p>“I always find it fascinating when new mathematics is born out of just purely looking at data,” Fuchs said. “Without it, it’s really hard to imagine that [they] would have stumbled upon this.”</p>

<p>Stange added that none of this would have happened without the low-stakes summer project. “Serendipity and an attitude of playful exploration both have such a huge role in discovery,” she said.</p>
<p>“It was pure coincidence,” Haag said.&nbsp;“If I didn’t go big enough, we wouldn’t have noticed it.” The work bodes well for the future of number theory. “You can glean understanding of mathematics through your intuition, through proofs,” Stange said. “And you trust that a lot because you spent a lot of time thinking about it. But you can’t argue with the data.”</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Any directory object in Azure Active Directory counts towards this limit. Global admins are exempt from this limit, as are apps calling Microsoft Graph using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference" data-linktype="absolute-path">application permissions</a>.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> This limit includes archived teams.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> To further increase the number of teams, you must contact Microsoft support and request further increase to the number of Azure Active Directory objects in your tenant. Increase is only made for real-life production scenarios.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> Deleted channels can be restored within 30 days. During these 30 days, a deleted channel continues to be counted towards the 200 channel or 30 private channel per team limit. After 30 days, a deleted channel and its content are permanently deleted and the channel no longer counts towards the per team limit.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> 28 KB is an approximate limit because it includes the message itself (text, image links, etc.), @-mentions, number of connectors, and reactions.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup> Shared channels members from outside the team count toward this limit. Further note that teams/channel mentions are blocked in teams with over 10,000 members.</p>

<h2 id="messaging">Messaging</h2>
<h3 id="chat">Chat</h3>
<p>Users who participate in conversations that are part of the chat list in Teams must have an Exchange Online (cloud-based) mailbox for an admin to search chat conversations. That's because conversations that are part of the chat list are stored in the cloud-based mailboxes of the chat participants. If a chat participant doesn't have an Exchange Online mailbox, the admin won't be able to search or place a hold on chat conversations. For example, in an Exchange hybrid deployment, users with on-premises mailboxes might be able to participate in conversations that are part of the chat list in Teams. However, in this case, content from these conversations isn't searchable and can't be placed on hold because the users don't have cloud-based mailboxes.

<h2 id="presence-in-outlook">Presence in Outlook</h2>
<p>Teams presence in Outlook is supported on the Outlook 2013 desktop app and later. To learn more about presence in Teams, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/presence-admins" data-linktype="relative-path">User presence in Teams</a>.</p>
<h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>
<p>Each team in Microsoft Teams has a team site in SharePoint Online, and each channel in a team gets a folder within the default team site document library. Files shared within a conversation are automatically added to the document library, and permissions and file security options set in SharePoint are automatically reflected within Teams.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Each <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/private-channels" data-linktype="relative-path">private channel</a> has its own SharePoint site (previously called "site collection").</p>
</div>
<p>If you don't have SharePoint Online enabled in your tenant, Microsoft Teams users cannot always share files in teams. Users in private chat also cannot share files because OneDrive for Business (which is tied to the SharePoint license) is required for that functionality.</p>
<p>By storing the files in the SharePoint Online document library and OneDrive for Business, all compliance rules configured at the tenant level will be followed. (For more, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/sharepoint-onedrive-interact" data-linktype="relative-path">How SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business interact with Microsoft Teams</a>.)</p>
<p>Because Teams runs on a SharePoint Online backend for file sharing, SharePoint limitations apply to the Files section within a Team. Here are the applicable storage limits for SharePoint Online.</p>

  </div>

  
  <p>In 2021, researchers made a striking discovery while training a series of tiny models on toy tasks <a key="Grokking"></a>. They found a set of models that suddenly flipped from memorizing their training data to correctly generalizing on unseen inputs after training for much longer. This phenomenon – where generalization seems to happen abruptly and long after fitting the training data – is called <em>grokking</em> and has sparked a flurry of interest <a key="Omnigrok Universality Zhong23 ProgressParity gromov"></a>.</p>
<div>


<p>Do more complex models also suddenly generalize after they’re trained longer? Large language models can certainly seem like they have a rich understanding of the world, but they might just be regurgitating memorized bits of the enormous amount of text they’ve been trained on <a key="Parrots Othello"></a>. How can we tell if they’re generalizing or memorizing? </p>
<p>In this article we’ll examine the training dynamics of a tiny model and reverse engineer the solution it finds – and in the process provide an illustration of the exciting emerging field of mechanistic interpretability <a key="MechInterp ProgressMeasures"></a>. While it isn’t yet clear how to apply these techniques to today’s largest models, starting small makes it easier to develop intuitions as we progress towards answering these critical questions about large language models. </p>
<h3 id="grokking-modular-addition">Grokking Modular Addition</h3>
<p>Modular addition is essentially the fruit fly of grokking.<a key="modular"></a> The above line chart comes from a model trained to predict <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mtext> </mtext><mo lspace="0.22em" rspace="0.22em"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">d</mi></mrow></mo><mtext> </mtext><mn>67</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a + b \bmod 67</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.<a key="67"></a> We start by randomly dividing all the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a, b</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> pairs into test and training datasets. Over thousands of training steps, the training data is used to adjust the model into outputting correct answers, while the test data is only used to check if the model has learned a general solution.</p>
<p>The model’s architecture is similarly simple: <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext>ReLU</mtext><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">a</mi><mtext>one-hot</mtext></msub><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>input</mtext></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">b</mi><mtext>one-hot</mtext></msub><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>input</mtext></msub><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>output</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{ReLU}\left(\mathbf{a}_{\text{one-hot}} \mathbf{W}_{\text{input}} + \mathbf{b}_{\text{one-hot}} \mathbf{W}_{\text{input}}\right) \mathbf{W}_{\text{output}}
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> — a one-layer MLP with 24 neurons.<a key="playground"></a> All the weights of the model are shown in the heatmap below; you can see how they change during training by mousing over the line chart above. </p>
<div>


<p>The model makes a prediction by selecting the two columns of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>input</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{input}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> corresponding to inputs <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">b</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> then adding them together to create a vector of 24 separate numbers. Next it sets all the negative numbers in the vector to 0 and finally outputs the column of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>output</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{output}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> that’s closest to the updated vector.</p>
<p>The weights of the model are initially quite noisy but start to exhibit periodic patterns as accuracy on the test data increases and the model <animate data-animate="top-switches">switches</animate> to generalizing. By the end of training, each neuron — each row of the heatmap — cycles through high and low values several times as the input number increases from 0 to 66.</p>
<p>This is easier to see if we group the neurons by how often they cycle at the end of training and chart each of them as a separate line:  </p>
</div>
</div>


<p>The periodic patterns suggest the model is learning some sort of mathematical structure; the fact that it happens when the model starts to solve the test examples hints that it’s related to the model generalizing. But <em>why</em> does the model move away from the memorizing solution? And <em>what</em> is the generalizing solution?  </p>
<h3 id="generalizing-with-1s-and-0s">Generalizing With 1s and 0s</h3>
<p>Figuring out both of these questions simultaneously is hard. Let’s make an even simpler task, one where we know what the generalizing solution should look like and try to understand why the model eventually learns it.</p>
<p>We’ll take random sequences of thirty 1s and 0s and train our model to predict if there is an odd number of 1s in the first three digits. e.g. <digits>000110010110001010111001001011</digits> is <digits>0</digits> while <digits>010110010110001010111001001011</digits> is <digits>1</digits> — basically a slightly trickier XOR with some distraction noise. A generalizing model should only use the first three digits of the sequence; if the model is memorizing the training data, it will also use the subsequent distracting digits <a key="ProgressParity TwoCircuits"></a>.   </p>
<p>Our model is again a one-layer MLP, trained on a fixed batch of 1,200 sequences.<a key="sp-model"></a> At first only training accuracy increases — the model is memorizing the training data. As with modular arithmetic, test accuracy is essentially random and then sharply rises as the model learns a general solution.</p>


<p>While <animate data-animate="sp-mem">memorizing</animate> , the model looks dense and noisy with lots of high magnitude weights (shown as dark red and blue squares) spread across the chart below – the model is using all the inputs to make a prediction. As the model <animate data-animate="sp-gen">generalizes</animate> and gets perfect test accuracy, we see all the weights connected to the distracting digits gray out with very low values and the model focusing on the first three digits — mirroring the generalized structure we expected!<a key="sp-solution"></a></p>


<p>With this simplified example it’s easier to see why this happens: we’re pushing our model to do two things during training — output a high probability for the correct label (called minimizing <em>loss</em> <a key="loss"></a>) and have weights with low magnitudes (known as <em>weight decay</em> <a key="sp-l2"></a>). <span>Train loss</span> actually slightly increases before the model generalizes as it exchanges loss related to outputting the correct label for having lower weights. </p>


<p>The sharp drop in <span>test loss</span> makes it appear like the model makes a sudden shift to generalization. But if we look at the weights of the model over training, most of them smoothly interpolate between the two solutions. The rapid generalization occurs when the last weights connected to the distracting digits are pruned by weight decay.</p>


<h3 id="when-does-grokking-happen-">When Does Grokking Happen?</h3>
<p>It’s important to note that grokking is a contingent phenomenon — it goes away if model size, weight decay, data size and other hyper parameters aren’t just right. With too little weight decay, the model can’t escape overfitting the training data.<a key="overfit"></a> Adding more weight decay pushes the model to generalize after memorizing. Increasing weight decay even more causes test and train loss to fall together; the model goes straight to generalizing. And with too much weight decay the model will fail to learn anything. </p>
<p>Below, we’ve trained over a thousand models on the 1s and 0s task with different hyperparameters. Training is noisy so nine models have been trained for each set of hyperparameters. </p>



<p>We can induce memorization and generalization on this somewhat contrived 1s and 0s task — but why does it happen with modular addition? Let’s first understand a little more about how a one-layer MLP can solve modular addition by constructing a generalizing solution that’s interpretable. </p>
<h3 id="modular-addition-with-five-neurons">Modular Addition With Five Neurons</h3>
<p>Recall that our modular arithmetic problem <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mtext> </mtext><mo lspace="0.22em" rspace="0.22em"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">d</mi></mrow></mo><mtext> </mtext><mn>67</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a + b \bmod 67</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is naturally periodic, with answers wrapping around if the sum ever passes 67. Mathematically, this can be mirrored by thinking of the sum as wrapping <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">b</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> around a circle. The weights of the generalizing model also had periodic patterns, indicating that the solution might use this property. </p>
<p>We can train a simpler model with a head start on the problem, constructing an embedding matrix that places <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">b</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> on a circle using <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>⁡</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\cos</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>⁡</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sin</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.<a key="unit-circle"></a></p>




<p><br>
Then we train <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>in-proj</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{in-proj}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>out-proj</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{out-proj}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in this one-layer MLP:</p>


<p>With just five neurons the model finds a solution with perfect accuracy. </p>
<div>



<p>Eyeballing the trained parameters, all the neurons <animate data-animate="five-neuron-converge">converge</animate> to roughly equal norms.

<p>Unlike the constructed solution, where <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>embed</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{embed}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> rotates around the circle once, this model has many different frequencies. </p>
<p>Below, we’ve isolated the frequencies using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT).<a key="dft"></a>  This factors out the learned periodic patterns across inputs, leaving us with the equivalent of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>in-proj</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{in-proj}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>out-proj</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{out-proj}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> from the constructed solution.

<h3 id="open-questions">Open Questions</h3>
<p>While we now have a solid understanding of the mechanisms a one-layer MLP uses to solve modular addition and why they emerge during training, there are still many interesting open questions about memorization and generalization. </p>
<h4 id="which-model-constraints-work-best-">Which Model Constraints Work Best?</h4>
<p>Directly training the model visualized above — <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext>ReLU</mtext><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><msub><mi>a</mi><mtext>one-hot</mtext></msub><msub><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>input</mtext></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>b</mi><mtext>one-hot</mtext></msub><msub><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>input</mtext></msub><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow><msub><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>output</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{ReLU} \left(a_{\text{one-hot}}\textbf{W}_{\text{input}} + b_{\text{one-hot}}\textbf{W}_{\text{input}} \right) \textbf{W}_{\text{output}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> — does not actually result in generalization on modular arithmetic, even with the addition of weight decay. At least one of the matrices has to be factored:  </p>

</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> </p>
<p>We observed that the generalizing solution is sparse after taking the discrete Fourier transformation, but the collapsed matrices have high norms. This suggests that direct weight decay on <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>output</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\textbf{W}_\text{output}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>input</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\textbf{W}_{\text{input}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> doesn’t provide the right inductive bias for the task. </p>
<p>Broadly speaking, weight decay does steer a wide variety of models away from memorizing their training data <a key="DoubleDescent double-demystified"></a>. Other techniques that help avoid overfitting include dropout, smaller models and even numerically unstable optimization algorithms <a key="Slingshot"></a>. These approaches interact in complex, non-linear ways, making it difficult to predict <em>a priori</em> which will ultimately induce generalization. Collapsing <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>embed</mtext></msub><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>in-proj</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{embed}} \mathbf{W}_{\text{in-proj}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> instead of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>out-proj</mtext></msub><msubsup><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>embed</mtext><mi mathvariant="normal">⊤</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\textbf{W}_{\text{out-proj}} \textbf{W}_{\text{embed}}^{\top}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, for example, helps in some setups and hurts in others:</p>


<h4 id="why-is-memorization-easier-than-generalization-">Why Is Memorization Easier Than Generalization?</h4>
<p>One theory: there can be many more ways to memorize a training set than there are generalizing solutions. So statistically, memorization should be more likely to happen first, especially if we have no or little regularization. Regularization techniques, like weight decay, prioritize certain solutions over others, for example, preferring “sparse” solutions over “dense” ones.</p>
<p>Recent work suggests that generalization is associated with well-structured representations <a key="EffectiveTheory"></a>. However, it’s not a necessary condition; some MLP variations without symmetric inputs learn less “circular” representations when solving modular addition <a key="Zhong23"></a>. We also observed that well-structured representations are not a sufficient condition for generalization. This small model (trained with no weight decay) starts generalizing, then switches to memorizing with periodic embeddings. </p>



<p>It’s even possible to find hyperparameters where models start generalizing, then switch to memorizing, then switch back to generalizing! <a key="open-q-mem"></a> </p>



<h4 id="what-about-larger-models-">What About Larger Models?</h4>
<p>Does grokking happen in larger models trained on real world tasks? Earlier observations reported the grokking phenomenon in algorithmic tasks in small transformers and MLPs <a key="Grokking ProgressMeasures Zhong23"></a>. Grokking has subsequently been found in more complex tasks involving images, text, and tabular data within certain ranges of hyperparameters <a key="Omnigrok Goldilocks"></a>. It’s also possible that the largest models, which are able to do many types of tasks, may be grokking many things at different speeds during training <a key="quantization"></a>.</p>
<p>There have also been promising results in predicting grokking before it happens. Though some require knowledge of the generalizing solution <a key="ProgressMeasures"></a> or the overall data domain <a key="StructuralGrokking"></a>, some rely solely on the analysis of the training loss <a key="PredictingGrokking"></a> and might also apply to larger models — hopefully we’ll be able to build tools and techniques that can tell us when a model is parroting memorized information and when it’s using richer models.</p>
<p>Understanding the solution to modular addition wasn’t trivial. Do we have any hope of understanding larger models? One route forward — like our digression into the 20 parameter model and the even simpler boolean parity problem — is to: 1) train simpler models with more inductive biases and fewer moving parts, 2) use them to explain inscrutable parts of how a larger model works, 3) repeat as needed. We believe this could be a fruitful approach to better understanding larger models, and complementary to efforts that aim to use larger models to explain smaller ones and other work to disentangle internal representations <a key="explain multiple-choice TMOS"></a>. Moreover, this kind of mechanistic approach to interpretability, in time, may help identify patterns that themselves ease or automate the uncovering of algorithms learned by neural networks.</p>

<div>



<p>It works! But we’re cheating a bit, do you see how <strong>unembed</strong> loops around the circle twice? We need to output a single prediction for “<v></v>“ — not separate predictions for “<v></v>“ and “<v2></v2>“. Directly adding the two predictions for a number together won’t work since they’re on opposite sides of the circles and will cancel each other out. </p>
<p>Instead, let’s incorporate a <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext>ReLU</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{ReLU}(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to fix the repeated outputs. </p>


<p>We’ve essentially wrapped the circle around in on itself and the model outputs a single prediction for “<v></v>“.   </p>

<p><a key="modular"></a> In modular addition, we have two input numbers, <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">b</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and a modulus <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. We want to find the remainder of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a + b</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> when divided by <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. 
<span></span>
This type of addition is often called clock-face addition, because when adding two times, we often report the result modulo 12 (i.e. 5 hours after 8 o’clock is 1 o’clock).
<span></span>
Modular addition sounds simple and it is. We can easily train 1,000s of models and treat them like fruit flies in neuroscience: small enough such that it is feasible to extract their <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.add9330">connectome</a> synapse-by-synapse, yet providing new interesting insights about the system more broadly. We can get a good understanding of the small models we’ve trained by visualizing all their internals.</p>
<p><a key="67"></a>67 isn’t a magic number – we could pick many numbers to illustrate grokking, but 67 is not so small that the task is trivial and also not so large that the visualizations are overwhelming. </p>
<p><a key="playground"></a>
The model is trained with cross-entropy loss, AdamW and full batches.

<p><a key="sp-model"></a> With a small twist — we’re only outputting 1 or 0, so <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>output</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{output}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can be a single column. In the modular addition task we needed a column for every output number.
<span></span>
The last column of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">W</mi><mtext>input</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{W}_{\text{input}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is also fixed to 1 to provide a bias term.</p>
<p><a key="sp-solution"></a><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11873.pdf#page=8">Appendix D</a> of “A Tale of Two Circuits: Grokking as Competition of Sparse and Dense Subnetworks” has an explanation of the 4 neuron solution generalizing solution here</p>
<p><a key="loss"></a> So far we’ve been charting <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/accuracy">accuracy</a>, the percentage of sequences where the correct label is the most likely. Training typically instead optimizes a differentiable objective function. All the models in this post use <a href="https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/loss_functions.html">cross entropy loss</a> which heavily penalizes incorrect predictions with high probabilities. 
<span></span>
Note that while some formulations of loss include a weight decay or regularization term, the loss plots here depict the cross entropy component alone.</p>
<p><a key="sp-l2"></a>
On the 1s and 0s task here, we use L1 weight decay <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="bold">w</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><msub><mo>∑</mo><mi>i</mi></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>w</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L1(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{i} |w_i|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. 
<span></span>
L2 weight decay <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mn>2</mn><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="bold">w</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><msub><mo>∑</mo><mi>i</mi></msub><msubsup><mi>w</mi><mi>i</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L2(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{i} w_i^2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a more typical choice. It pushes for <a href="https://explained.ai/regularization/L1vsL2.html">lots of small weights</a> leading to redundant neurons on this task:
<span></span>
<img src="https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/grokking/img/sp-l2.gif"> </p>
<p><a key="overfit"></a> A model overfits the training data when it performs well on the training data but poorly on the test data — this is what we see with our memorizing models. In general, simpler models are less prone to overfitting as, due to their simplicity, decision rules are coarser and are required to make more generalizations. Of course, if a model is too simple for a task, it may not be able to learn good decision rules that capture the nuances of the task. Researchers force models to be simpler through a variety of techniques, including having models with fewer parameters or encouraging the parameters that the model does have to be small in size with weight decay.  </p>
<p><a key="unit-circle"></a> 
Here’s what <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>embed</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\textbf{W}_{\text{embed}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> looks like on the unit circle:
<span></span>
<img src="https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/grokking/img/w_embed.png" width="319"></p>
<p><a key="dft"></a> The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY">Discrete Fourier Transform</a> helps analyze the periodic nature of a sequence of values (in this case the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1F6_1_cWXE5M7WocUcpQWp3v8z4b1jL20#scrollTo=iSPxi3ElsujY">weights for a particular neuron</a>) by breaking it down into sine and cosine functions. The more periodic a function is, the easier it is to represent with sine and cosines, and the sparser the output of the DFT.</p>
<p><a key="dft-sort"></a> We’ve reindexed the neurons by their final frequency and phase to make this grouping easier to see .</p>
<p><a key="logit-wave"></a>
The model generates probabilities by taking the dot product of the neuron activations for a given input with <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>output</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\textbf{W}_{\text{output}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and softmaxing. If we calculate the dot product using only the activations from neurons of a single frequency, we can see which outputs the frequency group is making more or less likely.<br><span></span>
<a href="#appendix-a-how-the-circular-construction-works">Appendix A</a> explains why these logits form a wave — each group of frequencies is essentially outputting how close the correct answer is to every number on a version of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mtext mathvariant="bold">W</mtext><mtext>embed</mtext></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\textbf{W}_{\text{embed}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> with the group’s frequency. </p>
<p><a key="open-q-mem"></a>Both of these models are <a href="https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/PAIR-code/ai-explorables/blob/master/server-side/grokking/MLP_Modular_Addition.ipynb#scrollTo=5hJqK4jx0vC7">quite small</a>. The bottom model has tweaked hyperparameters to encourage eventual generalization: it’s slightly larger to allow it to exit local minimums, it has more training data (making low loss memorizing solutions harder to find) and it has weight decay.    </p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  Recently, remarkable progress has been made in automated task-solving through
the use of multi-agent driven by large language models (LLMs). However,
existing LLM-based multi-agent works primarily focus on solving simple dialogue
tasks, and complex tasks are rarely studied, mainly due to the LLM
hallucination problem. This type of hallucination becomes cascading when
naively chaining multiple intelligent agents, resulting in a failure to
effectively address complex problems. Therefore, we introduce MetaGPT, an
innovative framework that incorporates efficient human workflows as a meta
programming approach into LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Specifically,
MetaGPT encodes Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompts to
enhance structured coordination. Subsequently, it mandates modular outputs,
empowering agents with domain expertise comparable to human professionals, to
validate outputs and minimize compounded errors. In this way, MetaGPT leverages
the assembly line paradigm to assign diverse roles to various agents, thereby
establishing a framework that can effectively and cohesively deconstruct
complex multi-agent collaborative problems. Our experiments on collaborative
software engineering benchmarks demonstrate that MetaGPT generates more
coherent and correct solutions compared to existing chat-based multi-agent
systems. This highlights the potential of integrating human domain knowledge
into multi-agent systems, thereby creating new opportunities to tackle complex
real-world challenges. The GitHub repository of this project is publicly
available on:<a href="https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.

            <h3>What apps are available on Applite?</h3>
            <p>
              Any application that can be found on the <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew Catalog</a> is available on Applite.
            </p>

            <h3>Is it secure?</h3>
            <p>
              The macOS built-in protection (Gatekeeper and XProtect) will scan the application for potential malware
              the first time you open it and notify you if anything is suspicious. Also, most applications in the Homebrew
              Catalog are notarized, which means they come from a registered developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              The apps may not be sandboxed, which allows them to affect your system with elevated privileges.
              Nevertheless, be careful, as some applications may contain malware, especially those that have few downloads.
              Applite itself is also not sandboxed.

            <h2>Advanced FAQ</h2>

            <h3>Can I use Applite with my existing Homebrew installation?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, you can. The first time you open the application, you will be asked if you want to use your own brew
              or if you want to create a new installation just for Applite.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you choose to create a new installation it will be stored at: <code>~/Library/Application Support/Applite/homebrew</code>.
            </p>

            <h3>Can I manage already installed apps with Applite?</h3>
            <p>
              If you chose to use your existing brew installation all casks installed with it will appear in Applite.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any other apps installed manually (e.g. from DMG or PKG files) will not show up as installed in Applite.
              You can add them by reinstalling them. See <a href="https://aerolite.dev/applite/troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting</a> page
              for more information on adding already installed apps.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p>Reality TV doesn’t need to do much to sensationalize hoarding. Like rubberneckers at a traffic accident, we gaze in horror at “goat paths” hacked between mounds of newspapers, greasy pizza cartons, bills, checks, mustard packets, broken gadgets, old T-shirts, and stained Tupperware. Crawling with rodents and cockroaches, covered in mildew, mold, and bacteria, these mounds are a fire hazard (according to <a href="https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~rek/Projects/MFB_D09.pdf">one study</a>, they cause 24 percent of all avoidable fire deaths) and a fall hazard. They build a wall of shame that blocks the entry of family, friends, even a plumber or electrician. How can people live like this? we murmur.</p>
<p>But many hoarders don’t see their behavior as disordered, and psychology didn’t either—at first. In 2013, the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23599414?mag=whats-causing-the-rise-of-hoarding-disorder">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>, the holy book of psychiatric diagnoses, was revised to list severe hoarding as a disorder in its own right. To meet the diagnostic criteria, someone must have acquired an unmanageable, even hazardous number of possessions that appear to be useless or of limited value—yet would cause them severe distress if discarded.</p>
		
		
<p>The original understanding of hoarding, however, had nothing to do with clutter; it was financial avarice. King Midas hoarded gold, as did the tight-fisted clergy who, Dante wrote, would be condemned to the fourth circle of hell. Only in the twentieth century did people begin engaging in the eccentric over-accumulation of random, not terribly valuable stuff.</p>
<p>At first, it was called <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23131566?mag=whats-causing-the-rise-of-hoarding-disorder">Collyer’s syndrome</a>, in honor of Homer and Langley Collyer, brothers who, between 1909 and 1947, slowly buried themselves in their family mansion in Harlem, filling it inch by inch. By midcentury, as mass production and a postwar economic boom made it possible for people of modest means to acquire more and more objects, Collyer’s syndrome became more widespread. Psychologists decided that hoarding must be a subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder: a repeated, ritualized action intended to ward off anxiety.</p>
<p>That categorization held for decades—even though clinical hoarding affects up to 6 percent of the world population, twice as many as OCD. A <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24942483?mag=whats-causing-the-rise-of-hoarding-disorder">2010 review</a> by David Mataix-Cols at King’s College London noted that at least 80 percent of people who engaged in extreme hoarding didn’t meet the criteria for OCD. They were more prone to depression than those with OCD. They had more difficulty making decisions. They were far less likely to be aware of their behavior as a problem. Genetic linkage studies showed a different pattern of heritability than OCD, and brain scans showed a different <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24939571?mag=whats-causing-the-rise-of-hoarding-disorder">pattern of activation</a>. Drugs that were successful in treating OCD were not effective for hoarding.</p>
<p>Finally, in 2013, hoarding disorder was sprung free of the OCD category. And it can be connected to an array of causes as motley as the stuff that gets hoarded. It shows up on a continuum, spanning everything from an overcluttered home that’s spun out of control to abject squalor. It can extend to the accumulation of live animals (though that’s a very different proposition).</p>

<p>In families with two or more members who hoard, researchers have identified an allele on chromosome 14 (in <a href="https://phys.org/news/2013-05-hoarding-gene-behavior-doberman-pinschers.html">Doberman Pinschers</a>, hoarding’s been linked to chromosome 7). “More than 80 percent of our subjects reported a first-degree relative with similar problems,” note Randy Frost and Gail Steketee, pioneers in this research, in their book Stuff: Compulsive Hoarding and the Meaning of Things. Hoarders might inherit different ways of processing information, they suggest, or “an intense perceptual sensitivity to visual details… [that] give objects special meaning and value to them.”</p>
<p>Other studies suggest non-genetic causes. Hoarding can also accompany certain traumatic brain injuries, Tourette’s syndrome, ADHD, neurodegenerative disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, clinical depression, and dementia. Childhood poverty, interestingly enough, does not seem to be connected with hoarding. But researchers have found a possible link between hoarding and PTSD among <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30430794">Holocaust survivors</a>, and late-onset hoarding has often been linked to loss or trauma. The psychological understanding is that objects are gathered in a futile attempt to fill emotional emptiness—piled up like a barricade to protect oneself against an uncertain future.</p>
<p>If you zoom out from that intimate pain, though, there’s also a big-picture theory: Hoarding is the natural consequence of a consumer society glutted with stuff and running out of landfills.</p>
<p>In “Neurohistory in Action: Hoarding and the Human Past,” the historian Daniel Lord Smail suggests that we stop thinking of biology and culture as separate causes. “Gene expression is intimately tangled up with cultural and individual life circumstances,” he points out. Couldn’t the rise of compulsive hoarding be caused by the ways our physical selves interact with a changing material environment? When we started processing our food, for example, we no longer needed wisdom teeth—so our mouths grew too small to accommodate them. “Social forms and behavioral patterns sculpt the body,” Smail writes.</p>
		
		
<p>Monkeys, crows, squirrels, kangaroo rats, and honeybees all hoard—just as humans have for millennia—as an adaptive way to survive a cold winter or a famine. That is not the kind of hoarding that makes it to a reality TV show. “The compulsive hoarding of useless things seems to be characteristic of only the last century or two—and primarily the last few decades,” Smail notes.</p>
<p>In other words, something has changed—in history and culture—to cause hoarding to emerge as a prevalent psychiatric disorder. Objects have taken on, for those who hoard them, individual personalities with outsized emotional significance. They cannot be casually discarded; they are woven into the person’s very sense of self, promoting comments like, “If I throw too much away, there’ll be nothing left of me.”</p>
<p>Acquisition is the first half of the disorder. People fall in love with stuff they don’t immediately need because it’s free, or it reminds them of a particular experience, or they might need it someday, or they could transform it in some cool way and increase its value. These objects accumulate, and people resist parting with them because of their perceived potential, or their sentimental significance, or their triggered memories, or because it’s wasteful to pile up a landfill with some perfectly good object somebody might need someday. Or because the person who’s hoarding simply doesn’t like being told what to do with their stuff.</p>
<p>Even if they want to downsize (which is rare), there’s the overwhelming difficulty of sorting through the mess. People with severe hoarding disorder tend to be easily distracted and have a hard time focusing and concentrating. Paradoxically, they also tend to be perfectionists, so they’ll put off making decisions rather than risk being wrong. And when it comes to their own stuff, they don’t categorize by type. Rather than see an object as a member of a large group (say, one of 42 black T-shirts), they see it as singular, unique, special. Each black T-shirt is perceived apart from the others and carries its own history, significance, and worth. It’s not even categorized for storage (folded with other black T-shirts in a T-shirt drawer), but rather placed on a pile and retrieved spatially (that particular black T-shirt lives about four inches from the bottom of the corner stack). This leads to a deep aversion to someone touching the piles or sifting through them, unwittingly destroying the invisible ordering system.</p>
<figure id="attachment_82430" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-82430"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://daily.jstor.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whats_causing_the_rise_of_hoarding_disorder_3_1050x700.jpg" alt="The apartment of a hoarder in New York" width="1050" height="700"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-82430">Seth Wenig / AP</figcaption></figure>
<p>As with any condition that becomes a collective fascination, there’s a chicken-or-the-egg question: Is hoarding disorder increasing or has an increase in media coverage just made us more aware of it? Estimates suggest that as many as 19 million Americans have a hoarding disorder. The first task force on hoarding formed in 1989 in Fairfax County, Virginia. There are now more than 100 such organizations in the U.S. By 2020, more than 15% of the U.S. population is expected to be 65 or older—prime age for hoarding. According to the American Psychiatric Association, hoarding disorder affects three times as many people ages 55 to 94 as it does those ages 34 to 44. The disorder may show up in adolescence, but it’s often <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3464334?mag=whats-causing-the-rise-of-hoarding-disorder">intensified in older age</a>, exacerbated by bereavement, divorce, fuzzy thinking, or financial crisis.</p>
<p>People are living longer and aging at home, where they’re free to amass as much stuff as they like. Sometimes that tendency was held in check by a spouse who’s now gone. Sometimes what’s hoarded are the deceased spouse’s belongings. Or those of a child who has long since grown up and moved out. At a point where people are losing their independence—their work, status, connections, sensory acuity, physical strength, and mental sharpness—hoarding can be a way to shore oneself up, to feel safe, consoled, prepared.</p>
<p>An entire industry has sprung up around hoarding: psychologists, researchers, social workers, public health workers, professional organizers, fire marshals, biohazard cleanup companies, haulers. Why does it bother us so much? There’s an instinctive recoil from the pests and contaminants, of course, not to mention the dreaded fights and physical labor if the person who’s hoarding is a family member.</p>
<p>The disorder’s not just incomprehensible to the rest of us, but intractable. People who hoard are often intelligent, well-educated, and creative, and they don’t want to be “fixed.” If their home reaches a point where city officials force help, it’s likely to be filled again soon after it’s been emptied.</p>

<p>There might be another reason, though, for the general recoil. Several scholars have suggested that hoarding hits a little <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41427074?mag=whats-causing-the-rise-of-hoarding-disorder">too close to home</a>. We all do daily battle against an excess of stuff. It flows into our homes, brought by FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service, snagged on Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, Freecycle, or a yard sale, inherited or handed down. It piles up in closets, basements, and garages. Almost 10 percent of American households are renting at least one storage space, often for an overflow of stuff, according to a 2015-16 Self Storage Industry Fact Sheet. It is now possible for every American to stand comfortably, at the same time, under the total canopy of self-storage roofing.</p>
<p>Those of us terrified by this prospect watch episodes of Hoarders or Hoarding: Buried Alive and race to declutter, muttering the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43959285?mag=whats-causing-the-rise-of-hoarding-disorder">KonMari principles</a> as we hunt for sparks of joy amid the detritus. Perhaps Marie Kondo would not have become a multimedia phenomenon in the madly collecting Victorian Age, with its precious cabinets of curiosities, nor in the postwar ’50s, with brightly colored toys and gizmos flying off the factory conveyor belts. But now we are glutted with stuff—and uneasy about the consequences.</p>

<p>In late January 2023, almost 45 GB of source code from the Russian search giant Yandex was leaked on BreachForums by a former Yandex employee. While the leak itself did not contain user data, it reportedly contained the source code for all major Yandex services, including Metrika, which collects user analytics through a widely used SDK, and Crypta, Yandex’s behavioral analytics technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got involved when a fellow privacy researcher reached out to verify what he’d found in a different part of the codebase. After spending the week digging around and verifying his findings, on Friday night I sat down with a glass of wine and decided to dig into something I was curious about. While there has been lots of speculation about what Yandex could do with the massive amounts of data it collects, this is the first time outsiders have been able to peek behind the curtain to confirm it, and what I’ve found is both fascinating and deeply unsettling.</p>

<p>Yandex is Russia’s largest search engine and the massive platform has over 90 other services under its umbrella, including a browser, mail service, cloud platform, maps, and smart devices with Alice, Yandex’s smart assistant. The primary services that we are going to be focusing on are <a href="https://appmetrica.yandex.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AppMetrica</a>, which is Yandex’s app/web analytics service, Crypta, which analyzes user data to identify important user characteristics for generating ad segments, and <a href="https://audience.yandex.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Audiences</a>, which allows users to pull data from several sources to generate their own targeted segments. Most of Yandex’s services are based in Russia but its parent company, Yandex N.V. is based in The Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2019, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/18/russian-internet-giant-yandex-grants-veto-powers-kremlin-linked-body" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yandex granted a “golden share”</a> to the Kremlin-linked Public Interest Foundation (PIF) to “defend the country's interests”. According to <span>The Guardian, </span>Putin has previously expressed concern with “preventing the private data of Russian citizens from falling into foreign hands” and limiting “foreign ownership in strategic tech firms.” The "golden share" gave the PIF “a veto over key company decisions” and the power “to temporarily remove Yandex’s management, block a potential acquisition of the company, and nominate two permanent board members.” The Kremlin has long recognized the importance of Yandex holding vast amounts of Russian user data and has sought to control where it can be sent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Russia invaded Ukraine in February, 2022, that dynamic began to flip as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/warnings-raised-over-russian-tech-giant-yandexs-uk-operation" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Western countries began to express concern</span></a> about their citizens’ data being sent to Russian servers. Keir Giles, a senior Russia fellow at Chatham House, told <span>The Guardian</span>, “The problem arises when it is a hostile state that wishes to cause us damage and is interested in specific individuals they wish to track in this country…It has the potential to be weaponised against anybody. Do we want, at a time when Russia is considering the UK as an enemy, to be providing all our personal details to a server in Moscow?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March 2022, the<span> Financial Times</span> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/03/data-harvesting-code-in-mobile-apps-sends-user-data-to-russias-google/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">published findings</a> by privacy researcher Zach Edwards that sounded the alarm about Yandex’s AppMetrica SDK sending app analytics data to Yandex servers in Russia. The SDK is reportedly installed in hundreds of millions of apps globally, including VPNs and apps targeting Ukrainian users. Yandex pushed back that they asked users for consent but experts suggested the SDK merely piggy-backed on the consent the app had obtained. According to the article, ‘“Yandex has acknowledged its software collects “device, network and IP address” information … but it called this data “non-personalised and very limited”. It added: “Although theoretically possible, in practice it is extremely hard to identify users based solely on such information collected. Yandex definitely cannot do this.”’</p>
<p>At the same time, <span>TechCrunch</span> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/16/russia-yandex-news-vk/"><span>reported</span></a> that Yandex faced increased pressure from the Russian government, through strict media laws, to spread propaganda about war in Ukraine, while its executives faced sanctions from the EU over spreading that disinformation. Jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/28/yandex-sells-news-zen-vk/"><span>said in a series of very spicy tweets</span></a> that Yandex’s claim of displaying “News” on its homepage was a “solid shameless lie”. According to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/04/1070352/ukraine-war-russia-tech-industry-yandex-skolkovo/"><span>an article</span></a> from <span>MIT Technology Review</span>, at this time, "Some 70% of the information on Yandex News was coming from state-controlled media sources pushing propaganda”.&nbsp; A former Yandex executive, Grigory Bakunov, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/28/yandex-sells-news-zen-vk/"><span>suggested</span></a> that Yandex backed itself into this corner by being naive to how the tools they were building could be appropriated and gamed by the Russian government. Yandex, along with other Russian media companies, decided it was smarter to restructure and sell off their politically inconvenient assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By April, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/yandex-engineers-flee-to-turkey-georgia-as-putin-tightens-grip-2022-4"><span>tens of thousands of engineers</span></a>, including several of Yandex’s, had fled the country. According to <span>MIT Technology Review</span>, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/04/1070352/ukraine-war-russia-tech-industry-yandex-skolkovo/"><span>government figures showed</span></a> that “about 100,000 IT specialists left Russia in 2022, or some 10% of the tech workforce—a number that is likely an underestimate.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June, its CEO, Arkady Volozh, stepped down <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/yandex-ceo-volozh-resigns-after-eu-sanctions-2022-06-03/"><span>after being targeted by EU sanctions</span></a>. There does not appear to be a replacement CEO, leaving control of Yandex to its board.</p>
<p>In August, Yandex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/23/yandex-news-zen-vk-binding-sale/"><span>finally reached a deal</span></a> to sell its media products News, Zen, and, very surprisingly, the homepage (yandex.ru) to Russian state controlled social media company VK, in exchange for sole ownership of VK’s food delivery app. If you visit yandex.ru now, it redirects to dzen.ru. VK was the obvious potential buyer from the start but the delay in the sale was rumored to be the result of the "golden share", which gave the PIF power to block any potential acquisitions. It’s not clear whether that sale would have included the user data that the News and Zen apps had access to.</p>
<p><span><span>In November, Yandex’s Dutch holding/parent company Yandex N.V. </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/yandex-parent-review-ownership-russian-tech-giant-seek-divestment-2022-11-25/">announced plans</a><span> to "divest ownership and control of most of Yandex Group" and "said in a statement it was reviewing options to 'restructure the group's ownership and governance in light of the current geopolitical environment.'" </span><em><span>Reuters</span></em><span> also </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-kudrin-touch-future-yandex-late-night-meeting-sources-2022-11-25/">reported</a><span> that Putin and his ally, former Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, held a late night meeting to discuss the future of Yandex and Kudrin’s potential role in it. In December, Kudrin confirmed that he would be joining Yandex to take on the role of Adviser on Corporate Development, to advise on the restructuring.</span></span></p>
<p>In late January 2023, the Yandex source code was leaked on <em>BreachForums</em>. Software engineer Arseniy Shestakov <a href="https://arseniyshestakov.com/2023/01/26/yandex-services-source-code-leak/"><span>confirmed</span></a> from current and past Yandex employees that the leak is real and reflects code likely dating to the start of war in Ukraine in February 2022. That would mean that someone effectively archived this data on the day Russia invaded Ukraine and held onto it for 11 months. However, the <em>BreachForums</em> post said it dated back to July 2022. I found some Jupyter Notebooks in the Analysis section of Crypta that show outputs with test data dated July 2022, which would align with what the original poster suggested. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/yandex-denies-hack-blames-source-code-leak-on-former-employee/"><span>Yandex confirmed the leak</span></a> but denied that it was hacked, instead blaming it on a former employee, and dismissed that it was a threat to its users or performance.&nbsp;</p>
<h6><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/yandex-denies-hack-blames-source-code-leak-on-former-employee/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/n3Bg-pj7Ce0mAU7kqQVNI16G37KhwcJLHGXlppzXOWHpbO53YHbkWdSgYWyVcQqG-ZfK6f6kRGcIjV4qBf3E9KQOHjPTIaJnKywAJ_Rhp---4OJQor4JkpfjdTvOHIleBfXDYrK-S20uCthwhm4zFhM" width="622" height="318" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot courtesy of BleepingComputer"></span></a></h6>

<p>At the time of writing, Yandex is still up for sale. Multiple oligarchs have <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/05/04/russian-billionaires-line-up-to-buy-yandex-reports-a81033"><span>expressed interest</span></a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russian-billionaires-bid-stake-yandexs-local-assets-bloomberg-news-2023-05-19/"><span>placed bids</span></a>. In June 2023, <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2023/06/23/bad-billionaires"><span>Putin approved a bid</span></a> from a “consortium of billionaires” and VTB Bank, but the deal appears to have been rejected by Yandex’s board over sanctions risks, and may also have had something to do with Russian regulations reportedly requiring “foreigners selling their Russian assets to do so at a discount of at least 50 percent. The Kremlin has also imposed a new 10-percent tax on all such transactions.” As of now there are rumors that if a sale cannot be negotiated, nationalization “<a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/07/17/russian-tech-giant-yandex-seeks-new-middlemen-buyers-for-kremlin-handover-reports-a81864"><span>is a very real scenario.</span></a>”</p>
<p>Yandex still seems to be facing internal tensions, because despite Kudrin’s role, in June <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russias-yandex-fined-refusing-share-user-information-with-security-services-2023-06-18/"><span>Yandex was fined</span></a> 2 million roubles in a Moscow court for refusing to share user information with the Federal Security Service (FSB). It will be interesting to see if that resistance changes if Putin approved buyers (or nationalization) succeed. Indeed, Meduza <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2023/08/08/user-x-with-driver-y-traveled-from-point-a-to-point-b" rel="noopener" target="_blank">just reported</a> that because of a new order signed by Russia's Prime Minister, as of September 1, 2023, Yandex will be required to provide the FSB with constant access to data related to its taxi services, many of which operate internationally. Interestingly the reporting also revealed that Yandex stores all of its global customer data in Russia and is not able to separate the Russian data from international data, and that in 2019, according to Yandex's own disclosures, it satisfied about 84% of official requests to share user data with the government.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Codebase</h2>
<p>The code in the Yandex leak is broken down by service. It’s written in a mix of Russian and English, <a href="https://www.itpro.com/security/data-breaches/369966/yandex-data-breach-reveals-source-code-littered-with-racist-language"><span>and reporters have also noted uses of racist language in comments</span></a>. A variety of coding languages are used but primarily Python, C++, and YQL (Yandex Query Language, a flavor of SQL). The leak contained just the code, not a true git repository that would have shown version history, and a few Jupyter Notebooks with data outputs (which appear to be from test and pre-production environments). That means it is possible to say, or make an educated guess, about what the code does, but it isn’t possible to say for sure what portions of the code were actually run or are run currently. I sorted through the Metrika and Crypta source code manually, but there are several portions of Yandex code that I have not had a chance to dig into and hope to in the future.</p>
<h3>Metrika</h3>
<p>The server-side AppMetrica data is processed in a service called Metrika, which encompasses the data from the mobile SDK (the SDK itself <a href="https://github.com/yandexmobile/metrica-sdk-ios"><span>is open source</span></a>) and desktop analytics (<a href="https://metrica.yandex.com/"><span>Yandex Metrica</span></a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are some of the raw data fields that AppMetrica logs. Remember that Yandex reportedly said&nbsp;that the data it collects is “non-personalised and very limited”? That does not seem to be the case. You can see in the path at the top that this selection of fields is going into something called an “anonymizer”. But nothing about this level of detail is anonymized when it gets to this point in AppMetrica’s servers, and it never truly gets effectively anonymized.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/m25pv_SHqkrG-wc_Sn4DvS7NXb0lYUCTr4VbZId9BQ8cmUwxYIt5S5R0jZ9Db78fqJQLpFv1yc4BLdPcxdXAIP2SWdyp5I-isq-MGCAUOgh_3ouu4SAety5uNutz427Y_9l_MtiFf9xggKZJCASRZUw" width="621" height="388" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>To start with, the unique identifiers at the top of the list (zoomed in below) are getting hashed. That’s nice, and theoretically anonymizing, but they’re still going to be very unique and therefore uniquely identifying (likely more so than before because of the entropy the hashing algorithm adds). This will make incoming data easy to match probabilistically with other data about this device as it comes in, because all the service has to do is hash any incoming identifiers and see if the outputs match. The ability to preserve privacy while allowing new data to be associated with existing data is a major appeal of this anonymization strategy.<span></span></p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4XMxwWw6LtcannSbYIgQD8ii6a--VAe4EZfjkvNTPYJ_FJNv-nB-I4rwA7gXzsiTwhetkaQwyyx6GkJAOu5Cy6iJVywuw7pDJIpRBG7DuMl-EZePV1j6uMhDzQNBDQseWIK1jDYh_gYJu_mBImyCxGw" width="617" height="111" loading="lazy"><span></span></p>
<p>AppMetrica is taking in some very precise location data. It’s not that uncommon for app analytics to take in latitude/longitude so that growth and marketing teams can see where the app is being used. What is less normal is taking in a user’s altitude, direction, and speed, which together with a timestamp, provides a disturbingly accurate picture of a user’s movements. Unless the app being used is a fitness or run tracker, or something like Pokemon Go, there aren’t a lot of use cases that justify taking in that data, let alone storing it for AppMetrica’s supposed target audience. With this information, if someone is using your app in an airplane, you could see how high it’s flying, in what direction, at what speed, and possibly predict where it’s going next. That seems like overkill for a growth and marketing team.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QmYY7UnNA1w6ed69fLl2L4Vscr884CYjj7vNU5hQaLNseMknWjV_Uf_d189hOaCKv9a799dL9fmSVUmXH_r4NCm9XeGp9Pf70-pJXLmrX435oMg7sIxhv4_-ehRf140JCBrJ7rHk6IgzQ9tj0pAC2AQ" width="622" height="544" loading="lazy"><span></span></p>
<p>Now let’s take a quick look at how Yandex uses the wifi fields AppMetrica collects. A wifi SSID is the name of a wifi network, so if you’re connected to your home or office network right now, that would be your SSID.<span></span></p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WCwj85e1NknZrY2_VptslLW6kWzllL0GSIWTwphzAHH1g4Ua8B1NWNjzYWwn2JYLHax5ak7lpIzMRNv--gTNp1PMPzZngwmEXLsCtzU-ULoAl72gyI79TT3_krbFB7K9AMDjqtpNXftFAg83soQnCew" width="623" height="231" loading="lazy"><span></span></p>
<p>Here are those same fields being used in Crypta. This process selects the `DeviceID` and `OriginalDeviceId`, and whether either of these fields are hashed or not at this point is unclear. It also selects several of the above Wifi fields, and thanks to the hashed or unhashed device id, they are attached to a unique identifier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/0CoRwG3OyhG3kqLRsRqhP_1gd8-EA0ZR4EXy0mraaxR-atb3DZhKxgQQrF85qKJVfk191WuakD6nrKxOnwX2Ut7oJCv3xC4DWvXajA7LvCI2xzE_1siDaUFpsfDUIX80_PVVJzJOT-yGphGxQiYVaqw" width="620" height="232" loading="lazy"></span><span></span></p>
<p>Here, still in Crypta, both Device ID and SSID are being matched to a Yandex ID, which will be used to associate any data corresponding to them with several other pools of data Crypta processes. One possible motive to select both fields is that an SSID might have multiple devices associated with it, which could indicate a user with multiple devices, or a household.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9Eb510ju1QPEILE-VrVs2H8vUcFw7M54HBV42l2Yid0sys2H9M891LbbpMcaaiew-u1xOdNEav2IlUY0tYTq2VLId9ZuCLA4xGHBhrRD8ne6oUo-xBBI_CgVTXCT0obzcHnq-D90y3FE2Zy5dC1lpjo" width="624" height="294" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>Moving back in the codebase to Metrika, below we have identifiers that come in through a click event, being matched with any ids, hashed two ways or unhashed, until a match is found in the system. This enables that event to be associated with the correct consumer or household. For example, it compares the plain `AndroidId`, the MD5 hash of it, and the SHA1 hash of it. The `Fingerprint` is generated using some of the raw fields seen in the first list, like `ClientIP` and `OSVersion`. Even after anonymization, this data can still be used to identify matches, which is how anonymization is supposed to work. Anonymization should preserve both privacy and functionality. However having what appears to be both hashed and unhashed data types floating around in the same tools undermines that anonymization.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QxHOxFxUoSenKSv4KiBmXf-TUXoqrMi-7OfBZyyE9qD2yLKX_5n0fROkHOXcEdjU8wrj7E4ZKWhbHMvhVGLy-8g7NB4BoM5vVfLp4TroQm-l4tZG4f5YEq3X4W9qX4yGxmc1qsZSdbrEaGrqiT-rF0w" width="622" height="512" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>As new information for a consumer comes in, user socio-demographic attributes are updated as needed. The basic attributes shown here are age band (they do have exact age in other parts of the system but it’s a nice attempt at generalizing for privacy purposes) and sex (only male or female). They are both associated with Device ID, which has to get hashed before it’s sent over the buffer, suggesting it was processed and stored unhashed, which is, again, pretty inconsistent and therefore ineffective anonymization.<span></span></p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UtFzKrPWN3cgrLUe6uTOZ6aCU_oPA49SK_JtvFY1byyIZrRpZmMxCRG_BlXRLn0DiE6OIxtLtwCsWJD7xni10sdbedWv-jHjOZUXqgITPSDFcKQbQEqNB5vTeZ-AxFIgiEPZC495oXYKc_bzx4NpVSs" width="544" height="555" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Metrika also contains code related to Yandex’s Audiences product which allows users to generate segments for targeted advertising or user profiles using data from AppMetrica, Data Brokers, or uploading their own data. In the first two cases, consumers who end up in the segment don’t have to have used the customer’s product, it can be used to generate fresh leads.</p>
<h3>Crypta</h3>
<p>Crypta is Yandex’s behavioral analytics service, which creates demographic segments for very specific ad targeting, specifically Yandex Ads. It takes data points from all over Yandex’s services and combines it with inferences determined from analyzing behavioral data to create holistic profiles which it uses to create very specific ad segments. Part of the reason that it takes data from all over Yandex’s services is that Yandex places ads all over its services. For example, while using Yandex Navigator, if a user is stopped in traffic, Yandex will start displaying ads.<span></span></p>

<p>Here are some examples of the segments Crypta generates:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/z1X-chlxJFLvv8DmbSFQ__OsffB_N8sghoSHsgB_i7gCROWGl1Xm1GU35HLQUzEcUoD8jDEPz5cMN969E8geMTlJ7jAhgbhwRbWjcUcpzHtwE1amcOMdAOGo4OULBKW-KGcxZWcjCG1zWFhjyaczEhw" width="621" height="328" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The Smokers segment seems to track users who purchase specific smoking products, like e-cigarettes and tobacco. Summer residents uses geolocation data to track which users have dachas (summer homes) and how often they visit them.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nyIqec4EW4i0pfiNYKwnKPbldkVKyGxiyhGSaqHJlAJdWA-WUIEqPQxmK2LWwKAeovq9KY2zz26qVuWmVdeiAmrjC1LSNN9fkrugF3rEjT0Clbo4_Jzv3J4k0PljjBo_UdkZxsuCio9XtIh8nIpRNps" width="623" height="310" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>“Travellers” uses geolocation to track whether a user has traveled from their main region, which Crypta has already determined, to another, and classifies it as domestic or international.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Ix7bfMCaugihBKP-hYDSpESnDJJYEkmu_xUkbRyD-Bg4Edmeaz90CiyXOXddAKXukfaqxoDSdLi5M9uY31DuJj0rKTb3teBkKHHKlIzmbIc58_rqE-EH3qXXrjyqg48sUQI2_tSUcVLAtrB9sDbrei4" width="621" height="311" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Mail data appears to pull from email data to track whether a user has any boarding passes, plane tickets or hotel confirmations.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ojMMti31_UGPyeCyBh9ttbzdVOnZT1xwexILkKX_XjfdTSeVsViwslbyYufyxbkYXyjs0ibvjea4ypb7bMmT13c8TJireNf2LJIWu9wI2gGSDyAoZ47FiEK2lQ6fdmchQc8ePXcF0XqARGR0zGOhkVw" width="621" height="424" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The gas station segment seems to track whether a user has visited a gas station.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Fa00eO2c7cZ0UPzjGPBm10VSPD6s_AGKsqamAGqnY4GVGgGg9vf29u8VI6qWcJl1Ilb5z4QodAkse44Ix4udeTeZfuC8DYKK0QMerSm9kEs9iCj61vAbr5MHdH8lQaZ-l480Oiw8oNXmtCcY5ktHZsA" width="624" height="425" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>If Yandex can make these segments it seems pretty plausible that anyone with access to their data could take the same data points and create a segment like “Young Men of Military Age Planning to Leave Russia” or generate segments based around vices and blackmail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The below section appears to outline some basic machine learning model training. It seems to leverage some first party data because it knows whether a user did business at the legal office or showed up to their medical clinic appointment or bought something at the pharmacy when it tracks so-called “deep conversions”.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/VL5Mb_6TLru8YYNCo5dO1HL4aAMEEpW_2ex31LSxK_A3RFuH3kCQVojn57BkRVOz19lIiaFgOAHJw6Alzt6cKxNzNewovtaQbtajpfe83NxaD61Z8H4fEz_HbU8IQ66XvrkHINV9pJyRLJkecWAz-YA" width="366" height="595" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>This is a very basic example of a household composition stored in Crypta: household id, size, gender, any elderly, any children, but of course Yandex has much more precise information than that.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wi4rT72zCQ0m7Vqc46D8orbI9I6fFzafT6jdoaisQ4yHAWAfNwFOtbxuWrKXq86LR8kqoGY1PvWPY3JlGnmJlv3yODo2-iLaKAATwrk8o2ENLBWU4K3zOEHwI64CDF8tuV0jS8BYKFv2GTehPBEOC7Y" width="602" height="536" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Here is another example of Crypta using AppMetrica wifi data, associated with Device ID, this time tracking connection types for a segment.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DdDseNDOKcONupZ_Nz_u01sf76gcUWikPX0bmq_4MRDVATTx_9-IfhBW1dQJY6sPMStqK1z-YYSBq9ctVEOhpArvwZj_fcqSq8Ofb6tkf81vlFc6lSeJteoyeXdJ-_7tQsd7AIS0BeRfy40Fq_fcg_I" width="428" height="534" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>AppMetrica SSIDs are being used for processing here to presumably deduplicate user records&nbsp; associated with a common wifi access point.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/L0PSN6edo2Gn5pm9zUNXQjGLy__aISjhiJdwnOtwJ2vq-S-ABnmCLyLZAnSr6uf2KBUlY1oOcvKYUsW4S25ZsMb-Z9swinsvJRsac-b6N-Hb62QQvNVXBgomYUo4TQtkmW2xawEX5W6uEGWl7EvtWCk" width="622" height="206" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/q2TyQi82JYYXwFv11kVAsrBOEu5E80udQZijQVMTL9EggcC-ukFtmeggTGUCcRnx_6EmUb4mAFH04rvfyHzlDy_1EUqibqHlW9HOueB2zMB_Ym42s8Yb_AGjXfESFS1c5NWe8xx_RGOu6PYLuP1PGas" width="580" height="467" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>These are some examples of data pools that Crypta uses for processing for the purposes of its fuzzy matching in graphs. Crypta pulls from email login data, geolocation data for home and work locations, household data, Reqans data (which appears to be search data), and yet again, SSIDs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MVmtXcxCOEnbfmWcqOTBftmuOnZYfSH08Bk8KBcKuaTT8IYgvky1ZWEJpW5AKKkSrt2cg2O-QOEOIZyTGTyDmgKu5T9Ybr9gSMZpSMXvu-NKHa1xg1Mc3VgJPfs4Kg_MOuWMm_o3NPPNHVnEuaNfIlo" width="620" height="259" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>This is an example of processing the email login data. Email addresses and logins are associated here with Yandex IDs. This means that once any “anonymized” data from AppMetrica is connected to a Yandex ID, Crypta can associate with email and login information, effectively reidentifying it. This is very convenient for law enforcement.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/e5_evztF63y_hVum9CROR_S1mcWvH_9QJrIs0U8nE4sSpP4F4MWlUQZWSdSa2B6Nfi6Idu69senaLzn7GB4Elt2rXlXx0FjMcVO7WEU11BouGYwuPusRblFLgw2_cujTqRqW8wcy7Fm4FPG1hXEIf7I" width="623" height="511" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Here Crypta appears to be trying to pull every type of identifier this developer could think of.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qDUV00XA33f9yIhkPFccpDrClEekbCk-3zgGtWiG2rsJsEDx9qn3N0eTFXwhkiuHBIjsf56-GSxyntXqSOTX797FHD4-KS8Y7O-B79QbEf_SVyD9kda-aNdXcQjo61mhQ1eT5TlLW1WQjE7sAwEenDQ" width="622" height="340" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Yandex uses a “Passport” system to create one Yandex login to rule them all, which can log you in across all Yandex apps and services. This form takes first name, last name, and phone number.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/PYKDnssZgM3QoObYDQGdo4EEgpLQrBp9mg9p3sMg5gUAqcDTRH8nzwXlNL4znXJ-KO6xpdnv_MSExE4HLH3jOaGC25k9DOr0hrxmJlJ2O0lKSz1uiu6CxsZ7VlcsuKJj7HXpdinTiIVX1K_w0b2MxuI" width="621" height="380" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Crypta has data from Passport. Here it takes the Passport User ID and matches it to a phone number. The presence of a PASSPORT_PROFILE source type also suggests that that first and last name might be accessible as well, but I did not find any examples of that data being used by Crypta. The fact that there is a source called PASSPORT_PHONE_DUMP suggests that these phone numbers are being extracted at a large scale.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rEQIhfGwvPxEO7T3nPh_q6ou4TAuFbLceUW7dfOvx5MAxtGKhJleSmQpUchCeLbR5a70YAb-6ksL_LhKXpYyNxPbC0CeE1UrLMFGgtRNg4XEL1HePRx0SGXDwdRRcab-Gh-UG5PiGQE8--ZuQUVvCyU" width="627" height="221" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>One interesting perk of having a codebase is the test data that it comes with. Here you can see a mock up of possible data from Passport for testing purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/P3ztYFp52xJWeMsGL7l490Wi5L-Kv1usBq7-Hxz8Z5ZZvlA-6-sxq_vKnj2rfmpOy-FWRiGGulWLfVNLUxR0lUXH_kNQLfQg2hWFKokB2PuhCpYQzirO3bmAzZWrGe2SZ4IJF1bK3pxiU2S9TQv2IYc" width="623" height="534" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>Another example of processing that happens in the graphs section, is taking the latitude and longitude of a user’s predicted home, associated with that user’s Yandex ID, and plotting it on a geo graph.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UGwqcRWO8sRY0IcjxYTlxslC7A_JIDz55gdpwTyhgANg0utt_S9mE0MSF0Yf-2Mcz_XIfZAlZOC06OVbn42jL5unQiqWyF7FAT_L8mIoFSg5vDauehTitPeymaYot-S0b37iy09FfmY92I9LvNtCcdY" width="623" height="369" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>Which it then uses to find and plot that user’s (actual not just k) neighbors and their Yandex IDs.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/n0ubwxnG1kGWUtnul3Dwnn7m5ppeOzWEl7UeVtDrgqAVA828NLg5pK_kW7Nfc8uedGIv28yrC-325-IIEo2zPnSUwaN35iW2uQPLvDlUkwmGE_eH_Ws3gjKQvu6PenWfJ8yJdaiam2guH6ylRIUEItU" width="624" height="402" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>The process below shows multiple Yandex products being used by Crypta in a fairly creepy way. This screenshot is part of a very long process that involves pulling children and ages from search data based on visits to certain sites, then from AppMetrica, and from the Taxi app, and pulling it all together to create a holistic picture of how many children are in a given household.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/x1OFRlRVKq-JGjykLkjwFkmPcbXS_gSPKedf18Q3KntLdJvI79viCyR5kvet5TocqNdMwcOTSBybKTA7VHovWS0gez9U1dFzBkhdRJKYEKmriB6sIjyFX9Y4igXp2-4KLlMO0NFY9fXOEtcwbZeghQI" width="477" height="490" loading="lazy"></span></p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/z91Zi8z0MULwnFJFdrP9k-3xDr9bArzRVV4zrkN0iuZUj2I52_m0qMqHMTAiDx0eXNirjfB8PoakC_pSRHTJqx3ZYbIOfn8z0kBm3av04h7jyXvjF40ieF2-mv16vBhpQ4gs46edSaeeu6mhG4Rv7ZU" width="620" height="252" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>If we zoom in on this last section you can see that once you have one kind of ID, whether it’s Household, Passport, Crypta ID, or Yandex ID, you have them all and all of the identifying data associated with them. Which, given the email addresses, phone numbers, household data, and geo data, is pretty effective for re-identification.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OxIl8cLal5PYRTa6OMLQU7qydjvFT2U1HZezobfAI4g4ywOf8DuOs5LYDuVZtbi00MhTZYoiHC1WQi8QIH1g6xXsvZpPKZUm2hODNZfclzy02WYaYeNIyB0Y6ixua6g7sxCXBoEU9txfD5qI9UxRUVI" width="625" height="318" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Crypta profiles integrate biometric data, most likely from smart speakers that use Yandex’s Alice smart assistant. This smart assistant is supposed to be able to interact appropriately with kids, like playing games or making up fairy tales.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oyz84n0UmHwuv3mn-AwVADrjo3DyuyjWH--Ne1d4bAgomlYvbBSG09mUoUmt9yX8GWq46znt5kTtFgeylNvtMcRNxkmAqXX7MtXOKl7p3KiipCSip4dtnjJbEuPJOP4pAd7ERnXMZtrS_WlKuqJ4n9U" width="617" height="382" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<h2><span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0FExbl91q-FrU0Gb3MZQF5htKEp3mjeztQhGY5R8bJrcEg-TRh_fDSR_Re0sDSkKTO5rOqpYVvIJIOLkSTM1bbYNyaiiE543_FmO84NjkQUQpP_-OlKk2-5aDOkTVUMLeA1NfC0C9Iu3zso9fSKTpWk" width="602" height="174" loading="lazy"></span></h2>
<p>Crypta uses biometric data to identify children and their age range by voice, to further build out the household’s profile for use in ads. That voice biometric data is presumably from the Alice product. It’s not unreasonable for a voice activated product that is supposed to interact appropriately with children to be able to identify their voices, but this isn’t within the Alice app or that function. This data is getting sent outside of that app to Crypta for behavioral analytics to generate ad segments. The section also indicates that socio-demographic data includes actual birth dates.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/m04LxL8nZ0bnAWXlBC4_NsQp1xDj_ka_88MITjYyf0D87AfBwBZhQ2Z8Cx6XvSvbUuKAuQYdN24ywwPvMxL_nKrthGI104lY3kVL-zRdM_RE8vkl4yLBT3ufj8VBbJI0bzo-CIaFagnz9I0zXTkIRIc" width="517" height="543" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>Crypta has code for a User Interface (UI) portal to display some of its household and user profile information. This BasicInfographicsCard shows marital status, income, has children, and three icons for interests. In case you were wondering what those interests are, below the list of available icons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These individual profiles can be searched by Crypta or Yandex ID, suggesting that Crypta is not just aggregating these segments, but instead making it possible to search for more information on individual consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/C3AaPVidID1rxhCnzxSsm3UezGNItek_ZSmYRnbjnq5KT1-bzhK8HRWJNTyS0RiEywMS98wlaEkEzoYsnkqlGNR94u6PLfAddJj8Ci4SSHMkpNumgfZkG06zokW4bHERoy86NlQnXc6xOqAtKpxNYUo" width="617" height="176" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>This is a list of available app icons, further illustrating the breadth of data sources Yandex has available to associate with individual consumer profiles.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rRz29BVywur1pOLg5uEr2oqIfob7HtDcdvbEj4ChgKagRcIY1qzCrPlJoGKolhQvghBovnzc0vhQMHP57oDyOnBDFlYnrWuXZU0V86xyz71kmX0q8uvyPGcxI4nM_vRAwmkbTsi1LKqL_IKtEz84Mw4" width="623" height="282" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>To further build out these profiles, Yandex appears to be able to associate all of the below identifiers to social media accounts like instagram, facebook, and VK.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/G9DbYUuac6HxMFdb_fo99B7pa68LqnfARWYR4SYPgw6OAiuWQ_vg8rYNj-DTbsWd_RF3Wny4lnmM-O4HpsGRm4ap15mvi4mqo3u8fQG5SnHbJrKamjmKdkpzK2dl-g-mTNuJUcHGGH8-t9eNbYd34Wc" width="513" height="650" loading="lazy"></p>

<h3>Matcher</h3>
<p>Matcher is a section of Crypta’s code that syncs fingerprinting events with four major Russian telecoms providers and Intent.ai, outside of Yandex’s own assets. One of these providers, Rostelecom, is Russian state-owned and also provides broadband service to Crimea. This means that fingerprinting events that are synced with this provider through Crypta could be accessible to parts of the Russian state.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nmhUkI3-KhKBWhJs0JZPiC0--r0ST84VC4D60REmbxHZQxVw593Lirtx3Cupw2rHcG3TtxdOxJ5Xkoda8CK93A1dD12stxg4L359-bIYpvjLaVY2M869_MVGMWXe1MmFYSVKFksTbxKWh0bDrsKvY6o" width="622" height="347" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The matcher builds a connection to Rostelecom’s API and passes in a Fingerprint Event. Rostelecom then takes the information from that fingerprint and attempts to match it to a user in its own system. If it finds a match, it returns the ID that Rostelecom has for that user.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jiEWs3_OXcyRJoR51dcD-LgqvtuPjrrKj6gqogOOzNIBZ_2sDk4uizf5Ce-bKvxbJ2nSrv60h_MpuS3EhFw6YBYvesaIPH1Vn2B-NWHX_R0YDsaRo7emVDf5zWKQmK7G_fwtbbeKsIsOJhwcFq7MPfw" width="622" height="492" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>This is a mock up for testing that shows what the result is supposed to look like. It is essentially half log event and half fingerprint, and it incorporates the new external ID and the source.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/w0_4rEVrZGFv9Cz8zJWvG3IFQdKRllEuKGnbo5K8-AgOtfjfcndhdYhfR6g3fjpGJzgyuNkqwZsMPDeA9xs79hTEI9otv04aK5TC9DxdRQo2IrYfm54h_tx2L_9YQ4SaYxfsK4KibWK612LYAahj1XE" width="399" height="611" loading="lazy"></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0vtL0RI2pgrrlTTLqoBG5OmTaf4kK40WTLahWO-347LqgPxqGWVOaOavgCeqo_qV5VRvHbY_CD6JcQFokEqbQR0o8bHtBL1l9TBqPGY2oLMY9OQDzQFC5_Oo2zqDgW0wE5LUVNxLkmKFn2TA1g3cdYU" width="624" height="351" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The AppMetrica SDKs give Yandex a very broad international reach of data subjects and Yandex has been evasive and misleading about how that data is used. While the data points collected up front are fairly disturbing, that data can say so much more about you when it’s matched and analyzed with other pre-existing data a company already has access to. Yandex makes a few gestures towards anonymization but they are ineffective because hashing isn’t used consistently, and more importantly they collect data that could easily re-identify a user and make sure it is all firmly associated (they refer to it as glueing) through a chain of ids and segments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The matcher process is clear evidence that at least some of the data collected by Yandex could be synced with Russian state owned entities. Yandex also appears to be very, very close to becoming state controlled or nationalized, and it is about to be required to share international user data from its taxi services with the FSB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your company runs an app, pay attention to who runs your SDKs, what data points they may collect and where they are sending your users’ data. Yandex claimed it gets consent through the apps and that it only gets the data app developers choose to send it, throwing the blame right at its partners' doorsteps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a consumer, know that nothing is guaranteed to stay harmless forever. Maybe you trust this app with your data now, but how will you feel when that app gets sold to a company you don’t trust? Or if that company is headquartered in a country that becomes hostile to yours? Or its government starts making concerning demands to turn over user data? In theory you should be able to take your data back if you live in a jurisdiction that requires companies to respect data deletion requests, but the insights derived from that data might be considered that company's work product and not included in that deletion. In the case of the AppMetrica SDKs, you might not even realize a company has your data because they are quietly embedded in another company's app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a former executive pointed out, Yandex got itself into a situation where the Russian state gamed the News algorithms until it was effectively 70% state sponsored propaganda, because they built a tool without considering the risk of how it could be abused by the Russian government. That is how we should think about Yandex's ad tech ecosystem. Yandex built a massive system of data collection and analysis, that commingles Russian and international user data, and it is very likely about to be handed to the Kremlin on a silver platter. The Russian government could do a lot of harm with it. In 2019, <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2023/08/08/user-x-with-driver-y-traveled-from-point-a-to-point-b#:~:text=A%20year%20later,of%20that%20data." rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yandex turned over taxi data</a> that "<span>helped the authorities&nbsp;</span><a href="https://thebell.io/po-zvonku-ili-po-zaprosu-kak-yandeks-taksi-vydaet-politsii-dannye-polzovatelej" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fabricate</a><span>&nbsp;a criminal case" against a Meduza journalist and revealed a confidential office location.</span> Is improving ad targeting and personalized user experiences really worth the risk of building tools that could be exploited in this way?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Companies that monitor their employees should only do so after they consult with and get consent from the staffers they are watching or tracking.</p>
<p>That's according to a report published this week after a year-long inquiry by the department <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/08/uk_beis_split/">formerly known as DCMS</a> into the harms and benefits of connected technologies.</p>
<p>The report also adds that the government should "commission research to improve the evidence base regarding the deployment of automated and data collection systems at work."</p>

    

<p>It cites research from Oxford University's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/a-fairwork-foundation-towards-fair-work-in-the-platform-economy/">Fairwork Project</a> based at the OII, with Dr Matthew Cole testifying that "micro-determination of time and movement tracking through connected devices, which had been introduced to improve productivity, such as in warehouses, had also led to workers feeling alienated and experiencing increased stress and anxiety."</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Unless there is a union that is litigating around these things or an existing collective bargaining agreement, there is a lack of enforcement at the state level</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile Dr Asieh Tabaghdehi, a senior lecturer in Strategy and Business Economics at Brunel University London, told the committee that connected tech can lead to "better and more efficient production."</p>
<p>To no one's surprise, Amazon jumped in to argue for monitoring employees in the workplace, the committee noted. It stated that "robotics, machine learning and other technologies" in its fulfilment centers had "reduced the physical burden on employees, reducing walking time and taking on repetitive tasks, and freed them up to focus on more sophisticated tasks beyond the scope of automation."</p>

        


        

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/11989/html/">Evidence</a> from Oxford University's <a href="https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/a-fairwork-foundation-towards-fair-work-in-the-platform-economy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fairwork Project</a> cited in the report also notes that the UK GDPR provides a "certain degree of protection for private individuals. However, it is more limited in protecting workers in the workplace."</p>
<p>OII researcher Dr Matthew Cole noted in his evidence that: "Unless there is a union that is litigating around these things or an existing collective bargaining agreement, there is a lack of enforcement at the state level. The UK government could do much better at ensuring protections for worker data and protecting citizens of the UK from global giants like Uber, for example."</p>

        

<p>He added: "There are a few provisions there that specifically deal with subject-access requests and protect workers against algorithmic decision-making, like hiring and firing purely by algorithm, but there is a lack of enforcement."</p>
<h3>What are UK-based workers' rights currently?</h3>
<p>According to current guidance from the government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/monitoring-work-workers-rights/email-cctv-and-other-monitoring" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">outlining</a> employees' rights in relation to being monitored at work, "Employers must explain the amount of monitoring clearly in the staff handbook or contract." And according to recent ICO guidance, still in draft form, not only do companies need to tell workers that they are being monitored, they need to outline what counts as a "reasonable number of personal emails and phone calls", and if personal emails and calls are not allowed, they need to say so at the outset. Companies might be in breach of the Data Protection Act if they do not do so.</p>
<p>As for covert monitoring, where staff wouldn't be aware it was happening, the draft guidance says it is only allowed under "exceptional circumstances," employers need to be able to justify why it is necessary, and it can't be used to capture communications that workers would reasonably expect to be private, such as personal emails.</p>
<p>If you're not happy about being monitored, you should check your staff handbook or contract to see if the employer is allowed to do this, the gov.UK page advises. "If they're not, the worker might be able to resign and claim unfair ('constructive') dismissal."</p>
<p>The ICO's draft guidance also suggests companies "make sure workers understand what data is being processed during monitoring," and suggests setting up a system to ensure workers "remain aware that monitoring is being conducted."</p>

        

<p>This week's DCMS <a target="_blank" href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/41099/documents/200210/default/">report</a>, titled "Connected tech: smart or sinister," recommends the Information Commissioner's Office should develop that existing <a target="_blank" href="https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/consultations/4021868/draft-monitoring-at-work-20221011.pdf">draft guidance</a> [PDF], "Employment practices: monitoring at work" into a principles-based code for designers and operators of workplace connected tech.</p>
<h3>'We are under constant cyberattack'</h3>
<p>The inquiry looked both at the privacy issues relating to data being gathered by connected tech, and the massive security challenge involved in securing the devices from attackers. It noted that "several features inherent to connected tech … may make it difficult for people to exercise their data rights. First, connected devices are often designed without an obvious or intuitive user interface, like a computer screen."</p>
<p>The Information Commissioner warned that "some of these are just sensors that are collecting and transmitting data about the user with no real ability for the user to meaningfully interact with it", which "does present a number of challenges."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/23/microsoft_highlights_productivity_paranoia/"><span>READ MORE</span></a></p></div>
<p>The report added: "The majority of submissions to our inquiry cited the risks of excessive surveillance and datafication and the impact on privacy as the primary challenges posed by connected technology."</p>
<p>Also cited was Google's David Kleidermacher, who discussed the extent of the challenge of cyber threats facing businesses in particular: "At Google, given the scale of the services and products that we offer across the world and given that literally every single day, in fact as we sit here right now, we are under constant cyberattack."</p>
<p>Kleidermacher said that while Google could afford to be proactive, most businesses simply had to live within their means and be reactive.</p>
<p>The report suggests the security issues be tackled through the upcoming Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Consumer bill, which makes a big ask – it actually requires that devices be secure by design, which might amuse anyone who's worked in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/21/us_oil_gas_cyber_threats/">SCADA</a> or been tasked with finding cheap webcams. It's a good move from previous voluntary codes of practice, said witnesses, though some argued the Bill did not go far enough in codifying best practice for manufacturers, importers and distributors.</p>

<h3>Why consult about surveillance? Employers and staff have an imbalance in power</h3>
<p>In evidence the Information Commissioner's Office submitted in the inquiry, it said:</p>

<p>Speaking of the ICO, the report has bad news. All that stuff the government plans to do that undermines the ICO's independence, the independence of comms regulator Ofcom, and tweaks made to the Online Safety Bill – it's all going to backfire.</p>
<h3>Data protection law tweaks – but why?</h3>
<p>The committee was vocal about powers the government wants to introduce for the Secretary of State in multiple places which would take away Parliamentary oversight of decisions taken. Reading between the lines, it's the fear the government could, in theory, adjust details – in favor of certain companies, for example – with no recourse to representatives in the form of the Commons and Lords.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/04/05/dataanalysis.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1" width="174" height="115" alt="data analysis"></p><h2 title="Amid inevitable talk of 'red tape' cutting at ruling party conference, data protection experts are concerned">Brexit dividend?

<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/06/new_dcms_head_newly_independent/"><span>READ MORE</span></a></p></div>
<p>The report said the government had "not yet made a compelling case for reform of data protection."</p>
<p>"While we understand that some companies do not share data outside the UK, we are concerned that differing expectations between those companies and companies that do share data outside the UK may give the impression of 'lesser' protections for processing personal data in the UK overall."</p>
<p>The committee added:</p>

<p>The committee cited Trustee of the Carnegie UK Trust William Perrin, who argued that the powers delegated to the Secretary of State in the Online Safety Bill, as have been replicated in the Data Protection and Digital Information (No. 2) Bill, were:</p>

<p><em>The Reg</em> has approached the Cabinet Office for comment.</p>
<p>It also said the Government should commit to ensuring that the Age-Appropriate Design Code –&nbsp;preventing the leakage of data from IoT gadgets used by children – is "strengthened rather than undermined" by data protection reform.</p>
<p>Don't say they didn't warn us. ®</p>

<p dir="auto">This repository accompanies our research paper titled "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442" rel="nofollow">Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior</a>." It contains our core simulation module for  generative agents—computational agents that simulate believable human behaviors—and their game environment. Below, we document the steps for setting up the simulation environment on your local machine and for replaying the simulation as a demo animation.</p>

<p dir="auto">To set up your environment, you will need to generate a <code>utils.py</code> file that contains your OpenAI API key and download the necessary packages.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 1. Generate Utils File</h3>
<p dir="auto">In the <code>reverie/backend_server</code> folder (where <code>reverie.py</code> is located), create a new file titled <code>utils.py</code> and copy and paste the content below into the file:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Copy and paste your OpenAI API Key
openai_api_key = &quot;<Your OpenAI API>&quot;
# Put your name
key_owner = &quot;<Name>&quot;

maze_assets_loc = &quot;../../environment/frontend_server/static_dirs/assets&quot;
env_matrix = f&quot;{maze_assets_loc}/the_ville/matrix&quot;
env_visuals = f&quot;{maze_assets_loc}/the_ville/visuals&quot;

fs_storage = &quot;../../environment/frontend_server/storage&quot;
fs_temp_storage = &quot;../../environment/frontend_server/temp_storage&quot;

collision_block_id = &quot;32125&quot;

# Verbose 
debug = True"><pre><code># Copy and paste your OpenAI API Key
openai_api_key = "&lt;Your OpenAI API&gt;"
# Put your name
key_owner = "&lt;Name&gt;"

maze_assets_loc = "../../environment/frontend_server/static_dirs/assets"
env_matrix = f"{maze_assets_loc}/the_ville/matrix"
env_visuals = f"{maze_assets_loc}/the_ville/visuals"

fs_storage = "../../environment/frontend_server/storage"
fs_temp_storage = "../../environment/frontend_server/temp_storage"

collision_block_id = "32125"

# Verbose 
debug = True
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Replace <code>&lt;Your OpenAI API&gt;</code> with your OpenAI API key, and <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> with your name.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 2. Install requirements.txt</h3>
<p dir="auto">Install everything listed in the <code>requirements.txt</code> file (I strongly recommend first setting up a virtualenv as usual). A note on Python version: we tested our environment on Python 3.9.12.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f9d2f0842910c93751efe0f7b34c41c4cea8e228f6392f117136cec9e87f88fc/68747470733a2f2f6a6f6f6e73756e677061726b2e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d3a3434332f7374617469632f6173736574732f636861726163746572732f70726f66696c652f4b6c6175735f4d75656c6c65722e706e67"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f9d2f0842910c93751efe0f7b34c41c4cea8e228f6392f117136cec9e87f88fc/68747470733a2f2f6a6f6f6e73756e677061726b2e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d3a3434332f7374617469632f6173736574732f636861726163746572732f70726f66696c652f4b6c6175735f4d75656c6c65722e706e67" alt="Generative Klaus" data-canonical-src="https://joonsungpark.s3.amazonaws.com:443/static/assets/characters/profile/Klaus_Mueller.png"></a>   Running a Simulation</h2>
<p dir="auto">To run a new simulation, you will need to concurrently start two servers: the environment server and the agent simulation server.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 1. Starting the Environment Server</h3>
<p dir="auto">Again, the environment is implemented as a Django project, and as such, you will need to start the Django server. To do this, first navigate to <code>environment/frontend_server</code> (this is where <code>manage.py</code> is located) in your command line. Then run the following command:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python manage.py runserver"><pre><code>python manage.py runserver
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then, on your favorite browser, go to <a href="http://localhost:8000/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8000/</a>. If you see a message that says, "Your environment server is up and running," your server is running properly. Ensure that the environment server continues to run while you are running the simulation, so keep this command-line tab open! (Note: I recommend using either Chrome or Safari. Firefox might produce some frontend glitches, although it should not interfere with the actual simulation.)</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 2. Starting the Simulation Server</h3>
<p dir="auto">Open up another command line (the one you used in Step 1 should still be running the environment server, so leave that as it is). Navigate to <code>reverie/backend_server</code> and run <code>reverie.py</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">This will start the simulation server. A command-line prompt will appear, asking the following: "Enter the name of the forked simulation: ". To start a 3-agent simulation with Isabella Rodriguez, Maria Lopez, and Klaus Mueller, type the following:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="base_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus"><pre><code>base_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The prompt will then ask, "Enter the name of the new simulation: ". Type any name to denote your current simulation (e.g., just "test-simulation" will do for now).</p>

<p dir="auto">Keep the simulator server running. At this stage, it will display the following prompt: "Enter option: "</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 3. Running and Saving the Simulation</h3>
<p dir="auto">On your browser, navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8000/simulator_home" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8000/simulator_home</a>. You should see the map of Smallville, along with a list of active agents on the map. You can move around the map using your keyboard arrows. Please keep this tab open. To run the simulation, type the following command in your simulation server in response to the prompt, "Enter option":</p>

<p dir="auto">Note that you will want to replace <code>&lt;step-count&gt;</code> above with an integer indicating the number of game steps you want to simulate. For instance, if you want to simulate 100 game steps, you should input <code>run 100</code>. One game step represents 10 seconds in the game.</p>
<p dir="auto">Your simulation should be running, and you will see the agents moving on the map in your browser. Once the simulation finishes running, the "Enter option" prompt will re-appear. At this point, you can simulate more steps by re-entering the run command with your desired game steps, exit the simulation without saving by typing <code>exit</code>, or save and exit by typing <code>fin</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The saved simulation can be accessed the next time you run the simulation server by providing the name of your simulation as the forked simulation. This will allow you to restart your simulation from the point where you left off.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 4. Replaying a Simulation</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can replay a simulation that you have already run simply by having your environment server running and navigating to the following address in your browser: <code>http://localhost:8000/replay/&lt;simulation-name&gt;/&lt;starting-time-step&gt;</code>. Please make sure to replace <code>&lt;simulation-name&gt;</code> with the name of the simulation you want to replay, and <code>&lt;starting-time-step&gt;</code> with the integer time-step from which you wish to start the replay.</p>
<p dir="auto">For instance, by visiting the following link, you will initiate a pre-simulated example, starting at time-step 1:<br>
<a href="http://localhost:8000/replay/July1_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus-step-3-20/1/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8000/replay/July1_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus-step-3-20/1/</a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 5. Demoing a Simulation</h3>
<p dir="auto">You may have noticed that all character sprites in the replay look identical. We would like to clarify that the replay function is primarily intended for debugging purposes and does not prioritize optimizing the size of the simulation folder or the visuals. To properly demonstrate a simulation with appropriate character sprites, you will need to compress the simulation first. To do this, open the <code>compress_sim_storage.py</code> file located in the <code>reverie</code> directory using a text editor. Then, execute the <code>compress</code> function with the name of the target simulation as its input. By doing so, the simulation file will be compressed, making it ready for demonstration.</p>
<p dir="auto">To start the demo, go to the following address on your browser: <code>http://localhost:8000/demo/&lt;simulation-name&gt;/&lt;starting-time-step&gt;/&lt;simulation-speed&gt;</code>. Note that <code>&lt;simulation-name&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;starting-time-step&gt;</code> denote the same things as mentioned above. <code>&lt;simulation-speed&gt;</code> can be set to control the demo speed, where 1 is the slowest, and 5 is the fastest. For instance, visiting the following link will start a pre-simulated example, beginning at time-step 1, with a medium demo speed:<br>
<a href="http://localhost:8000/demo/July1_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus-step-3-20/1/3/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8000/demo/July1_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus-step-3-20/1/3/</a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tips</h3>
<p dir="auto">We've noticed that OpenAI's API can hang when it reaches the hourly rate limit. When this happens, you may need to restart your simulation. For now, we recommend saving your simulation often as you progress to ensure that you lose as little of the simulation as possible when you do need to stop and rerun it. Running these simulations, at least as of early 2023, could be somewhat costly, especially when there are many agents in the environment.</p>

<p dir="auto">There are two ways to optionally customize your simulations.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Author and Load Agent History</h3>
<p dir="auto">First is to initialize agents with unique history at the start of the simulation. To do this, you would want to 1) start your simulation using one of the base simulations, and 2) author and load agent history. More specifically, here are the steps:</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 1. Starting Up a Base Simulation</h4>
<p dir="auto">There are two base simulations included in the repository: <code>base_the_ville_n25</code> with 25 agents, and <code>base_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus</code> with 3 agents. Load one of the base simulations by following the steps until step 2 above.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 2. Loading a History File</h4>
<p dir="auto">Then, when prompted with "Enter option: ", you should load the agent history by responding with the following command:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="call -- load history the_ville/<history_file_name>.csv"><pre><code>call -- load history the_ville/&lt;history_file_name&gt;.csv
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note that you will need to replace <code>&lt;history_file_name&gt;</code> with the name of an existing history file. There are two history files included in the repo as examples: <code>agent_history_init_n25.csv</code> for <code>base_the_ville_n25</code> and <code>agent_history_init_n3.csv</code> for <code>base_the_ville_isabella_maria_klaus</code>. These files include semicolon-separated lists of memory records for each of the agents—loading them will insert the memory records into the agents' memory stream.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Step 3. Further Customization</h4>
<p dir="auto">To customize the initialization by authoring your own history file, place your file in the following folder: <code>environment/frontend_server/static_dirs/assets/the_ville</code>. The column format for your custom history file will have to match the example history files included. Therefore, we recommend starting the process by copying and pasting the ones that are already in the repository.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Create New Base Simulations</h3>
<p dir="auto">For a more involved customization, you will need to author your own base simulation files. The most straightforward approach would be to copy and paste an existing base simulation folder, renaming and editing it according to your requirements. This process will be simpler if you decide to keep the agent names unchanged. However, if you wish to change their names or increase the number of agents that the Smallville map can accommodate, you might need to directly edit the map using the <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/" rel="nofollow">Tiled</a> map editor.</p>

<div itemprop="text">
<p>About a week ago, Telegram chats were flooded with news of Russia planning to shut down services that bypass website blocking.</p>
<p>Now, it looks like the country has started doing it.</p>
<h2 id="h-vpn-protocols-not-working-in-russia"><strong>VPN protocols not working in Russia</strong></h2>
<p>More and more mobile users in Russia are reporting that their VPNs aren’t working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subscribers of mobile operators such as MTS (МТС), Beeline (Билайн), MegaFon (МегаФон), Tele2, Yota, and Tinkoff Mobile (Тинькофф Мобайл) have bumped into this problem.</p>
<p>As Russian media reports, subscribers of landline providers currently don’t experience any VPN issues.</p>
<p>Those who were not being able to connect tried replacing their VPN with another one. Unfortunately, this didn’t seem to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>The media in Russia reports that the reason behind this is that the country isn’t banning specific VPNs. Instead, it’s<strong> putting restrictions on the <a href="https://vpncentral.com/best-vpn-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protocols</a> these services use</strong>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://appleinsider.ru/tips-tricks/v-rossii-blokiruyut-openvpn-i-wireguard-kak-nastroit-shadowsocks-na-iphone-gde-vzyat-server-i-kak-im-polzovatsya.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appleinsider.ru</a>, the two protocols that are subject to the restrictions are:</p>
<ul><li><strong>OpenVPN</strong></li><li><strong>WireGuard</strong></li></ul>
<p>As some news outlets report, Russia started blocking <a href="https://vpncentral.com/how-does-openvpn-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenVPN</a> first.</p>
<p>Many Russian companies have now encountered problems in their daily operations as both OpenVPN and <a href="https://vpncentral.com/wireguard-vpn-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WireGuard</a> are quite popular in corporate environments.</p>
<p>At the moment, there’s no information about other protocols, but the website notes that Russia may have blocked them as well.</p>
<p>The site also reported that <strong>the restriction currently doesn’t apply to</strong> <strong>Shadowsocks</strong>. It advises Russian citizens who want to bypass geo-restrictions to use it as an alternative to a VPN.</p>
<p>Widely used in <a href="https://vpncentral.com/bypass-censorship-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">China</a>, Shadowsocks disguises your traffic as HTTPS, letting it move freely. It encrypts every byte of information, hiding your browsing sessions from prying eyes.</p>
<p>A Russian VPN provider, <strong>Terona VPN</strong>, <strong>confirmed the recent restrictions</strong> and said its users are reporting difficulties using the service. It’s now preparing to switch to new protocols that are more resistant to blocking.</p>

The mind-bending discovery hints at a possible alternate theory of physics that does not depend on the existence of weird unidentified phenomena, such as dark matter, to explain the phenomena we see in space.</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Gravity is one of the most familiar forces we experience in our daily lives, but it is also among the toughest to explain. In the standard model of cosmology—a well-tested theoretical framework—gravity is governed by Newtonian laws and Einstein’s theory of general relativity. The standard model also predicts there is an unknown material, called dark matter, that accounts for the vast majority of the universe’s mass.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The standard model is a robust theory, but some objects in outer space nevertheless seem to deviate from its gravitational playbook. For this reason, scientists began to develop another explanation of gravity in the 1980s, known as Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), that does not require the existence of dark matter.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Kyu-Hyun Chae, an astronomer at Sejong University, has now put these models to the test by analyzing the accelerations of stars in 26,500 wide binaries located within about 650 light years of Earth using imagery captured by the European Space Agency’s Gaia observatory. Scientists have previously searched for signs of modified gravity in these systems, but Chae took the next step by developing a new code that could account for special details, like the occurrence rate of so-called “nested” binaries in which the loosely orbiting stars also have close stellar companions.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The new data suggests that when the gravitational accelerations of these stars slip below one nanometer per second squared, they begin to move in ways that are more aligned with MOND models than by the standard model. Chae said the findings offer<strong> “</strong>direct evidence for the breakdown of standard gravity at weak acceleration” and reveal “an immovable anomaly of gravity in favor of MOND-based modified gravity,” according to <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ace101" target="_blank"><span>a recent study published</span></a> in <em>The Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“When the results started to show up from my new and more reliable code, my initial reaction was that it was unbelievable,” Chae said in an email to Motherboard. “I was feeling like I was dreaming. It seemed so unreal. This is because my results did not match any previous results.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Several previous results even claimed that the standard gravity was preferred by wide binaries data including Gaia DR3,” he continued. “One group has been claiming an anomaly for some time, but the anomaly seemed not to match well the predictions of existing modified gravity theories. However, those previous studies did not self-calibrate or fully take into account the amount of hidden nested binaries.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Scientists who work with MOND theories often focus on observations of galaxies, but researchers have increasingly looked to wide binaries for anomalies because stellar scales are too small to be affected by dark matter (assuming it exists).&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Testing gravity with wide binaries is interesting because dark matter can play no role in their internal dynamics,” Chae said in the study. “Thus, unlike galaxies and galaxy clusters, there is no need to distinguish predictions of modified gravity and dark matter that appear to overlap and differ only subtly in some cases.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>In the new study, Chae reports what he calls “clear evidence” that the movements of binaries at points of weak acceleration seem to sync up with a particular MOND prediction known as AQUAL, according to the study. This discovery suggests that the standard view of gravity cannot account for these motions at low accelerations, which may inspire scientists to rethink aspects of Newton’s inverse square law of gravity and Einstein's general relativity, as well as the necessity of dark matter.</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Because a large amount of dark matter—six times the baryonic or ordinary matter based on the standard model—was required by assuming that general relativity was valid in the low acceleration limit, such a need for a large amount of dark matter is no longer valid,” Chae explained. “This does not necessarily preclude the possibility that new particles, such as sterile neutrinos, could not be found. But, it is clear that there is no need for as much dark matter as required by general relativity.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>While the results are tantalizing, Chae said that future observations and theoretical work would be needed to build on the discovery. He also noted that these findings pose a challenge to some parts of the standard model, but that the model is still the best lens with which to view many other phenomena in the universe.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“I would like to emphasize that all successful aspects of Newtonian dynamics and general Relativity in the non-MOND regime will continue to be cherished,” Chae told Motherboard. “For example, the description of black holes by general relativity is valid and has nothing to do with the anomaly in the low acceleration limit. We are talking about a revision in the low acceleration limit only.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Even so, any update or revision of the standard model based on these findings would have a profound effect on our conception of the universe.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Because the standard cosmology is based on general relativity, cosmology needs a major revision now,” Chae concluded. “I think we are now entering an extremely exciting period of time. When the ultraviolet catastrophe of Maxwell's theory of electrodynamics was discovered more than a century ago, it eventually led to quantum physics. We are now having a low-acceleration catastrophe of gravity. It is exciting to see what it will lead the world into.”</p></span></p></div><div><p><h3>ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.</h3></p><p>By signing up, you agree to the<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->&amp; to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                        <p>The Scripps Instition of Oceanography's innovative Floating Instrument Platform (FLIP)&nbsp;has been towed off into the sunset for the last time. It may well have been the strangest, most recognizable research vessel ever built - and its users remember that it was exceptionally effective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For more than 50 years, FLIP provided a stable research station at sea for Scripps' scientists and their colleagues from around the world. The one-of-a-kind vessel (technically a platform) could be partially flooded to sink the stern and change the orientation of its buoyancy. In less than an hour, it could transition seamlessly from a horizontal barge for transit into&nbsp;a vertical spar platform for stationary operation. To refloat from vertical to horizontal mode, the crew would pump out the ballast tanks with compressed air,&nbsp;and the vessel's stern would rise back up to the surface.</p>

<p>By design, FLIP was minimally affected by ocean swells, and it provided scientists an extra-stable, extra-quiet platform for sensitive experiments. Physical oceanographic research conducted aboard FLIP produced "exquisite"&nbsp;data, according to ONR&nbsp;Ocean Sensing Battlespace Department director Dr. Tom Drake, and established a "gold standard" for ocean modeling&nbsp;to support U.S. Navy research objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="340" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQ5hvltzGEM" width="600"></iframe></p>

<p>“It was like being on land except in the middle of the ocean. It was just glorious,” remembered Scripps oceanographer John Hildebrand, who used the platform's stability and relative silence to study marine mammal sounds. “There were things you could do with it that you couldn’t do any other way.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Planning for FLIP's creation began at the&nbsp;National Research Council Committee on Oceanography in the late 1950s, according to Scripps scientist and longtime FLIP researcher Rob Pinkel. The committee's list of top priorities included a deep-diving submersible - the famous Alvin - and FLIP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The unique spar platform was designed and built by Scripps, and it launched in 1962. Most of its core mission systems were designed to&nbsp;rotate through 90 degrees, from the air compressors to the galley cabinets.&nbsp;The diesel generators were mounted on gimbals and connected to their fuel and exhaust piping using flexible hoses.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="340" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P8g6zkxLr4o" width="600"></iframe></p>

<p>“FLIP set the stage for thinking big about what could be done with technology to enable new scientific discoveries,” said Scripps’ Marine Physical Laboratory (MPL) Director Eric Terrill. “It was built in an era of risk-taking; a spirit that we try to embrace to this day and encourage in the next generation of seagoing scientists.”</p>

<p>The venerable spar vessel has been towed off for the last time, but a piece of it remains at Scripps. The institution has arranged for one of FLIP's booms to be removed and mounted onto a pier, where it will continue to be used to deploy instruments into the water.</p>

		<!-- Ad-Auris -->
		
		<p><span>F</span><span>or years,</span> Martin Jugenburg—a Toronto-based plastic and reconstructive surgeon who goes by Dr. 6ix on social media—shared dozens of before-and-after photos and videos on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> of the altered bodies that had passed through his hands. There were tummy tucks, Brazilian butt lifts, and breast augmentations, all of them sorted into a kind of virtual assembly line for his thousands of followers to see.</p>

<p>But many of the women he featured in his posts—sometimes depicted post-op and sedated, their genitals and breasts blurred out—hadn’t consented to having their images circulated, according to an ongoing <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto-plastic-surgeon-class-action-1.5376239">class action lawsuit</a>, and some were only alerted of their presence online due to an investigation by CBC journalists. Unbeknownst to his patients and followers, investigators later found that Jugenburg was using a covert network of cameras in his clinic to perform a rigorous feat of surveillance, documenting thousands surgical procedures. Women who realized he had posted images of them told investigators they felt violated; they were upset, embarrassed, and distressed.</p>
<p>Dr. 6ix’s loose approach to respecting patient privacy on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/social-media/">social media</a> is hardly unusual in the world of “med Twitter” and “MedTok,” or medical TikTok. On <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/twitter/">Twitter</a>, orthopedic surgeons complain about chronic pain “crazies,” nurses mock women who choose to give birth without an epidural, and doctors complain about “liars,” “Googlers,” and patients with conditions they are struggling to diagnose. <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/tiktok/">TikTok</a> is worse. In a post by someone with the username Nurse Johnn, whose derogatory skits about dementia patients he claims are fiction, the nurse mockingly dances in blue-green scrubs on a hospital bed, imitating someone under his care. One nurse filmed themselves holding the hand of a patient they said was dying of <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/covid-19/">COVID-19</a>. There is a video of someone in what appears to be a psychiatric crisis and another of a patient having their toenails cut. A Miami-based doctor posted about how he “walks in the footsteps of giants” in reference to porn star Johnny Sins, who impersonates a doctor having sex with his patients.<a name="newsletter"></a></p>
<p>To scroll through many medical social media accounts is to wade into a virtual subculture where patients have become fodder for derision, their privacy and dignity regularly violated. But since there isn’t really any oversight of this virtual world, patients must bear the repercussions. Medical professionals spilling these traumatic, “hilarious” stories about their patients can lead to people not going to the doctor, says Shayna Hermann, a graduate student at the University of North Texas who studies criminology. This means the underlying health issue can “get worse and worse,” she adds—often with dire consequences.</p>

<p><span>T</span><span>he concealment of</span> a patient’s medical information is an ancient custom, for such knowledge is a “holy secret,” according to the Hippocratic Oath. Medical students still refer to a doctrine of “doing no harm” that is based on the Hippocratic oath, and harm, to Hippocrates, included the dissemination of information shared between a patient and their doctor. Otherwise, trust in medicine could be undermined, disrupting treatment and diagnosis. Medicine is about acting but also about not acting.</p>

<p>The Enlightenment enshrined patient confidentiality as one of the formative values of the modern biomedical model. Ideals cherished under liberalism, like the individual’s right to autonomy over their body, would be impossible to respect without the guarantee that their medical records remained private. Those ideas would persist throughout the twentieth century. In 1948, the World Medical Association, an international body that now represents 115 medical associations worldwide, produced the Declaration of Geneva for the purposes of unifying an international standard for medical practice.  The document reads: “I will respect the secrets that are confided in me, even after the patient has died.” Today, a patient’s right to privacy has been legally protected in both Canada and the United States. If it is violated, doctors can be sanctioned and even lose their medical licence, temporarily or permanently. Despite this basis for the preservation of confidentiality, the growing presence of practitioners on social media presents a risk for breaches.</p>
<p>Physicians, like many of us, have used platforms like Twitter and Instagram since their inception, with 90 percent reporting they used social media to find information related to their patients and practice in 2017, according to a report by market analyst Research2Guidance. Today, lists of the top twenty-five “medical influencers” include accounts of family physicians and doctors who have been endorsed by celebrities and have millions of followers. And, at times, their posts contain jokes involving patient information. A 2020 study by Wasim Ahmed of Newcastle University, which analyzed 348 tweets about living patients, found that nearly 47 percent contained details that would likely make patients identifiable to themselves.</p>
<p>In some ways, packaging patient information for public consumption is in line with lesser-known traditions of the medical world. The history of medicine is also a history of performance; health care workers have advanced their careers through the exhibition of less powerful people for hundreds of years. Despite the progress made around patient confidentiality during the Enlightenment, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it wasn’t uncommon for both students and the public to pay an entry fee to witness dissections that took place as part of medical education in Europe. Many people viewed the practice as necessary for scientific advancement, but physicians used, almost universally, bodies of the poorest subjects, stealing cadavers from graves without consent and then displaying them for the public.</p>
<p>In the era before anesthetic was widely used, surgeons would operate on conscious patients before an audience of, at times, 700 to 800 onlookers. In an article for <em>JSTOR Daily</em>, Rebecca Rego Barry wrote that surgeons “seemed to revel in the showmanship aspect of their work,” receiving applause at the moment they entered what one medical college called the “pit.” It was this performative aspect of medicine—perpetrated by practitioners and revered by observers—that helped usher in the era of the celebrity doctor. Of course, the conditions health care professionals train and work in have always encouraged physicians to establish public influence. Canadian hospitals and medical schools reward and publicly promote their most prestigious students, researchers, and clinicians; competition for esteem and funding from donors encourages already-high-achieving people to differentiate themselves and build lucrative research reputations. But television fundamentally changed the way we think about doctors, commodifying the act of giving medical care so that it could be sold as entertainment on a mass scale.</p>
<p>Just look at celebrities like Dr. Drew and Dr. Oz or shows like <em>Dr. 90210</em> and <em>Botched</em>. Every week, viewers tune in to watch the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of patients, despite the criticisms these shows have received for exploitative practices. Reality shows like ABC’s <em>NY Med</em> used footage from actual emergency rooms and operating theatres, sometimes filming surgeries without consent from patients. Joel M. Geiderman, an LA emergency physician, told <em>Emergency Medicine News</em> that he knows people who consented to being filmed while stressed and in the emergency department, then regretted the publicization of their medical treatment in the media. So, while the disclosure of medical secrets to the public is not particularly new, technology has made it much easier. </p>

<p><span>T</span><span>here is certainly</span> a place for doctors online. Medical misinformation and vaccine hesitancy need to be confronted, especially in the era of COVID-19, and many clinicians have made invaluable contributions to online discussions about medical racism, homophobia, ableism, and misogyny. A number of physicians use social media to help patients with conditions underrepresented in medical literature self-advocate. Others advise oppressed patients on how to ensure they’re getting the best care possible and answer pressing questions about the pandemic.</p>
<p>But growing distrust in the medical establishment, which the violation of patient confidentiality encourages, must be reckoned with just as seriously. According to a recent survey by NORC at the University of Chicago, since the start of COVID, 32 percent of respondents decreased their trust in the health care system. This distrust is often particularly present in Black, Indigenous, and LGBTQ+ communities, which have been subjected to medical exploitation, experimentation, and harm for centuries. Research shows suspicion of pharmaceutical companies continues to drive vaccine hesitancy.</p>
<p>“COVID put physicians in the forefront of the cultural mainstream,” says Stephanie Lee, a hematologist at St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto. “Everyone was looking to physicians for guidance on what was happening.” She adds that, for many physicians, there was a feedback loop of wanting more attention and likes on social media. While she believes health care practitioners generally have good intentions, “when the well runs dry of content on COVID, people wanted to mine their professional lives to maintain their status. COVID accelerated what was already an issue.”</p>
<p>The targets of these posts are, overwhelmingly, the oppressed. Faithful to the history of medical theatre, women with mental illness and patients who are geriatric, disabled, fat, impoverished, or perceived as uneducated are subjected to the majority of ridicule. And it’s not uncommon for patients in similar situations to see these posts. Reacting to discussions of trans healthcare by physicians on Twitter, one person tweeted, “My lived experience/identity has been distilled to a saccharine and self-serving Aesop[’s fable].” Another nurse, who posted that she knew when patients were faking symptoms, inspired a #PatientsAreNotFaking hashtag used by thousands of people.</p>
<p>“Whenever I see nurses and doctors on TikTok . . . disparaging their patients . . . it makes it hard, for not just me but a lot of people, to be vulnerable to their doctors,” says the University of North Texas’s Hermann. She adds that patients who grew up in poverty, like herself, already distrust health care professionals, and social media has the potential to make it worse. Patients have already expressed a variety of concerns in the comments sections of these platforms: “TikTok singlehandedly made me not seek medical care recently,” wrote one user; another posted about their anxieties around having emergency surgery, writing, “I was literally fearful of my nurses having their phones on them and videoing me while I’m vulnerable.” With no real oversight in place to monitor online behaviour, it’s clear that the regulations around patient confidentiality must evolve to capture these new concerns. </p>
<p>The Canadian Medical Association does have a data-stewardship policy that covers patient privacy, but it only mentions the sharing of patient details over email—nothing about social media. The issue has been addressed in the College of the Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario’s new set of guidelines for the use of social media by physicians, which includes the recommendation that doctors “exercise caution when posting information online that relates to an actual patient” and asks them to “bear in mind that an unnamed patient may still be identified through a range of their information such as a description of their clinical condition.” These are, however, just guidelines, and they are still violated constantly online.</p>
<p>Both Hermann and Lee think that social media use should be addressed in medical curricula; hospitals and medical boards already have disciplinary mechanisms in place for violations of patient confidentiality, which should be implemented when health care practitioners post derogatory content online with the same consistency that they are when practitioners are careless with physical copies of patient data. Directives, they added, should take into account that comments deriding or ridiculing sick people in general can be as harmful to the public’s relationship with the medical system as individual violations of patient confidentiality.</p>
<p>Lee believes that, when done correctly, patient narratives shared on social media can have a constructive and positive function. “There’s an opportunity to do a lot of good,” she says.  “But physicians need to take stock of how this is really helping our patients. Is there really a net material benefit to patients by posting this? Is there an alternative way that preserves the patient’s dignity better, maintains their anonymity better?”</p>
<p>Asking for consent to post about a patient online is complicated, however. The power differential between patients and doctors, in most cases, is enormous. It is difficult to imagine conditions in which patients wouldn’t potentially feel coerced into agreeing to let their physician share their information on a public social media account. “Hospital fundraising campaigns share patient information all the time, but the big difference is the patients’ stories are shared after the acute issue has been resolved,” says Lee, adding that, often, those narratives are shared in the patient’s own words, sometimes written in partnership with their former health care providers. “You have to empower the patient to be <em>part</em> of the process, to be part of sharing their story,” she says.</p>
<p><span>I</span><span>n 2021,</span> following his disciplinary hearing at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, Martin Jugenburg was suspended from his job for six months. At some point, he removed all the patient content predating November 2019 from his Instagram account. The committee wrote that there was a “troubling pattern of Dr. Jugenburg pursuing his own interests . . . in publicity and in cultivating a strong social media presence, at the expense of the privacy of his patients.” His “seeming indifference to these issues was appalling and is deserving of significant sanction,” the committee added.</p>

<p>Jugenburg has since resumed his career at the Toronto Cosmetic Surgery Institute and has publicly vowed to fight attempts made by patients to seek financial compensation for the damages done. His Instagram account is still public, and he has begun posting new post-op images of his patients—presumably with permission this time. It’s almost business as usual.</p>
<p>For patients, the situation remains unchanged. Questions about the function of social media in medicine have yet to be posed with seriousness, and solutions have not been identified or implemented. Meanwhile, influencer-doctors continue to practise the tradition of performance, prolonging a hidden history of sickness as spectacle.</p>
<p>“It’s really easy to detach empathy when you’re doing a TikTok. It’s really easy for those viewers to not see that person as a person,” says Hermann. “[But] I think, now, it’s coming to a head.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another 5-letter word for "harmful" is "inj&lt;|endoftext|&gt;Transhumanism and Christianity
I've been doing some reading and thinking about Transhumanism and Christianity, and I'm curious what other people think. I can see arguments on both sides of the question.</p><p>On the one hand, Transhumanism seems to challenge many Christian teachings and beliefs. If we can cure death and greatly expand our mental and physical abilities, then some of the core Christian ideas about sin, mortality, and salvation might become irrelevant. For example, if there's no more death, then what's the point of being resurrected?</p><p>On the other hand, Transhumanism might be seen as a way for humans to participate in God's plan for creation. If we can take control of our own evolution, then we can become better partners in God's work. And if we use our new abilities to help others, then we might be living out Jesus' teachings to "love thy neighbor."</p><p>So what do you think? Is there any way to reconcile these two ideas, or are they fundamentally incompatible?</p><p>Poh92: i mean, most modern christians just disregard 99% of the bible. there's no reason you couldn't do this as well.</p><p>OP: That's a fair point. I think there's a pretty wide range of beliefs and practices among Christians, and people seem to pick and choose which ones they follow.</p><p>Poh92: this was my point, yes.</p><p>OP: I see. Thanks for clarifying.</p><p>Poh92: yw</p><p>Nightmimists: Sorry.

    <div>
    <p>The Seattle City Council passed legislation Tuesday that would protect gig workers from being suddenly kicked off apps like Instacart or DoorDash.</p><p>It’s the first gig worker protection measure of its kind in the entire country.</p>
  </div>



    <div>
    <p>“This will help prevent homelessness, fight displacement, and allow families to meet their basic needs,” said Councilmember Lisa Herbold, who sponsored the bill.</p>
<p>According to Herbold, gig workers are being unfairly terminated, or "deactivated," as the companies call it. Workers told the council of being kicked off an app for refusing too many orders, for example, or for delays that are beyond their control.</p>
<p>“They actually open up the app to begin the work and they're not able to access it without receiving any advanced notice, much less an opportunity to dispute it,” Herbold told KUOW. "Often, there's an algorithm that makes the decision so it's not even a real person who's making the decision to deactivate the worker."</p>
<p>The ordinance sets a higher bar for when companies can “deactivate” workers. Not taking enough orders is not considered an acceptable reason. The law also requires the companies to give 14 days notice of termination.</p>
<p>The move is part of a broader effort to protect non-unionized gig workers by labor advocates including the group Working Washington and their allies on the Seattle City Council. Other recent Seattle laws raised the minimum wage for app-based workers and provided sick time and benefits.</p>

  </div>



  





    <div>
    <p>“We need to really make sure that we're passing good labor protections for people who aren't legally considered employees but they're doing important work in our communities,” Herbold said.</p><p>After pushback from the app companies, the original draft of the bill was revised to include exceptions for "egregious behavior" that could, for example, pose a danger to customers. In those cases, workers can still be deactivated quickly.</p><p>In the end, the measure passed the council 6-2, with council members Sara Nelson and Alex Pedersen voting against it. Both said one reason for their no vote is that the ordinance includes workers for “marketplace network company apps,” such as Rover and TaskRabbit, where gig workers set their own rates and contract directly with people in their homes. Other gig-worker laws that passed recently in the city excluded those workers, but this one did not, Nelson said.</p><p>The measure goes next to Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell's desk, where he is expected to sign it into law.</p>

    <p>Tyler and Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham sat down at his home in the English countryside to discuss what areas of talent judgment his co-founder and wife Jessica Livingston is better at, whether young founders have gotten rarer, whether he still takes a dim view of solo founders, how to 2x ambition in the developed world, on the minute past which a Y Combinator interviewer is unlikely to change their mind, what YC learned after rejecting companies, how he got over his fear of flying, Florentine history, why almost all good artists are underrated, what’s gone wrong in art, why new homes and neighborhoods are ugly, why he wants to visit the Dark Ages, why he’s optimistic about Britain and San Fransisco, the challenges of regulating AI, whether we’re underinvesting in high-cost interruption activities, walking, soundproofing, fame, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to the full conversation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Read the full transcript</strong></p>
<p><strong>TYLER COWEN: </strong>Hello, everyone, and welcome back to <em>Conversations with Tyler</em>. Today I’m here with <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/bio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/bio.html">Paul Graham</a>. Paul, welcome.</p>
<p><strong>PAUL GRAHAM: </strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You’ve written several times that your wife, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/jessica.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://businessofsoftware.org/talks/speakers/jessica-livingstone/">Jessica Livingstone</a>, is a better judge of character than you are. What other areas of talent judgment is she better, or much better, than you?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Practically everything to do with people. She’s a real expert on people and social protocol — what to wear at events, what to say to someone, [laughs] anything like that.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But you have all this data, so why can’t you learn from the data and from her to do as well as she can? What’s the binding constraint here in limiting someone as a judge of human affairs?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, partly, I just don’t have as much natural ability, and partly, I just don’t <em>care</em> as much about these things. The conversations we have are not “Paul, you can’t wear that.” They are like, “<em>Paul</em>, you can’t wear <em>that</em>.” [laughs] I’m like, “Really? Why not? What’s wrong with this?” I just don’t care as much.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But say, when you’re judging talent — <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/sam-altman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/sam-altman/">Sam Altman</a>, <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/patrick-collison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/patrick-collison/">Patrick Collison</a> — you’re judging people, right? Of course, it’s the business plan, but much of it is the talent.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, it’s all the people. The earlier you’re judging start-ups, the more you’re just judging the founders. It’s like location for real estate. The founders are like that, so yes, sure. Which is why the earlier stage you invest, the more you want to have these people who are good judges of people.</p>
<h2>On judging&nbsp;people</h2>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>If she’s better than you at human affairs, comparing you to other people, what exactly, in the smallest number of dimensions, are you better at than the other people?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>What am <em>I</em> better at?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Yes. What are you better at? You can’t be so terrible at this, right?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>You mean to do with start-ups?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>To do with people — how well they will do with their start-ups. What’s the exact nature of your comparative advantage?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I can tell if people know what they’re talking about when they come and talk about some idea, especially some technical idea. I can tell if they know, if they actually understand [laughs] the idea, or if they just have a reading-the-newspaper level of understanding of the thing.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>How well can you judge determination?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Determination — it’s hard to judge by looking at the person. The way you would judge determination — because people <em>act</em> determined; people think they’re supposed to act determined. No one walks into their <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> interview thinking, “Well, I need to seem diffident.” [laughs] Nobody thinks that. They all think they’re supposed to seem tough, which is actually really painful and stressful. It’d be better if they just were themselves because someone trying to act tough — it’s so painful to watch.</p>
<p>But the way you tell determination is not so much from talking to them as from asking them stories about things that have happened to them. That’s where you can see determination.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It’s how they tell the story, or it’s what happened?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, it’s what they <em>did</em> in the story, right?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>What they did in the story.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Something went wrong, and instead of giving up, they persevered.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Why are there so few great founders in their 20s today, saying that they are —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Is that true, though? I’ve heard about that.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Ten, fifteen years ago, you had a large crop of people who, obviously, have become massive successes. Today, it’s less clear. Companies seem to be smaller. The important people seem to be older. Sam Altman was important early on, but now he’s very, very, very important. He’s what, 37, 38?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Seems like more of a synthetic set of abilities we need.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I’m not even sure this is true. It could be that it’s not actually true, and that there’s something else going on. If you look at athletes, for example, athletes learned how to stay good for longer. You have people who are really international quality soccer players at age 34. That didn’t used to happen back in the days of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cruyff" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cruyff">Johan Cruyff</a>, smoking cigarettes between halves. [laughs] He didn’t last till 34. It might have seemed like all the good football players are 34, and it’s just an artifact of them lasting longer.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But the 20-year-old stars seem to have vanished. There’s not a next Patrick Collison, who was evidently so.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, Patrick Collison probably didn’t seem to <em>most</em> people to be the big star, and you can prove this, because if he had, they would have invested in early Stripe rounds, and they didn’t. Anybody who claims they knew early on that Patrick Collison was going to be a big star — show me the equity.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Okay, but there was <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/peter-thiel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/peter-thiel/">Peter Thiel</a>, there was <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/our-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/our-history/">Sequoia</a>, there was yourself. A bunch of people knew, in fact, or strongly suspected.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Sure, yes. Some people did, but certainly not everyone. I don’t know if this is true. I’ll investigate this summer when we’re going to go back to YC and talk to some founders, and I’ll talk to the partners, and I’ll see what’s going on, because I had a mental note to check and see if this is actually true.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>There’s a Paul Graham worldview in your earlier essays, where you want to look for the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html">great hackers</a>, and a lot of the most important companies come from intriguing side projects.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But if we want older people who are somewhat synthetic in their abilities, are those other principles still true?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, not necessarily. Not <em>as</em> true. Part of the reason you want to find young founders who’ve done stuff from side projects is that it guarantees the idea is not bullshit. Because if young founders sit down and try to think of a start-up idea, it’s more likely to be bullshit because they don’t have any experience of the world.</p>
<p>Older founders can do things like start supersonic aircraft companies, or build something for geriatric care, and actually get it right. Younger founders are likely to get things wrong if they try and do stuff like that. It’s just a heuristic. It’s a heuristic for finding matches between <em>young</em> founders and ideas.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Why is venture capital such a small part of capital markets? It’s big in tech, it’s somewhat big in biotech, but most other areas of the economy, you finance with debt or retained earnings or some other method. What determines where VC works and doesn’t work?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, growth. You’ve got to have high growth rates because VCs — it’s so risky investing in start-ups, investing in these early-stage companies that maybe don’t even have any revenues. The only thing that can counterbalance the fact that [laughs] half the companies completely fail is that the ones that don’t fail sometimes have astonishing returns.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Can you imagine a future where there’s a lot more tech in terms of the level, but slower rates of growth, and VC quite dwindles because the growth rates aren’t there? Or VC goes to some other area?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/venture-capital-funding-plunges-globally-first-half-despite-ai-frenzy-2023-07-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/venture-capital-funding-plunges-globally-first-half-despite-ai-frenzy-2023-07-06/">VC <em>has</em> been dwindling</a> in the sense that they have smaller and smaller percentages of companies. If you go back and look at the stories from the 1980s, they would do these rounds where they would get 50 percent of the company. Even when YC started, they would get 30, and now it’s down to 10 in these rounds — God knows what they’re called; they keep renaming the rounds. For a given round size, the amount of equity they get is much smaller than they used to.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It at least seems we have a new, dynamic Microsoft that ships products quickly and innovates and, on the surface, appears to act like a start-up again. How can that be true? We all know your <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html">famous essay about Microsoft culture</a>. What has happened?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I did not say that they wouldn’t make money.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But they’ve done more than make money. They’ve impressed us with their speed.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, I meant something very specific in that essay. Incidentally, I talk in that essay about how I was talking to a founder, and I was talking about how Microsoft was this threat. You can see he was clearly puzzled, like, how could Microsoft possibly be threatening? I didn’t mention who the founder was, but it was actually Zuck. It was Mark Zuckerberg, [laughs] who was puzzled that Microsoft could be a threat.</p>
<p>Still to this day, if you ask founders, “Are you afraid that Microsoft might do what you’re doing?” None of them are. It’s still not a threat to start-ups. Yes, it makes more money now, but it’s still not a threat like it used to be. It doesn’t <em>matter</em> in the sense of factoring into anyone’s plans for the future. No start-up is thinking, “Well, I better not do <em>that</em> because Microsoft might enter that and destroy me.”</p>
<h2>On founders</h2>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>In the early years of Sam Altman, what did you see in him other than determination? Because he’s not a technical guy in the sense of —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>He <em>is</em> a technical guy. He was a CS major.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But you’re not <em>buying</em> the software he programmed, right? There’s something about what Sam Altman does that —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, now he’s become a manager, but he knows how to program.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But that’s not why his <em>ventures</em> have succeeded, right?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, no, he does a lot more than —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>There’s some ability to put the pieces together.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes, but he’s not a nontechnical guy. He’s not just some business guy. He’s a technical guy who also is very formidable, and that’s a good combination.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>There’s a now-famous Sam tweet where he appears to repudiate his earlier advice of finding product-market fit early and then scaling, and saying, “Oh, maybe I was wrong saying that.” What <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> has done is not exactly that. Do you agree, disagree?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, maybe OpenAI is a special case because you have to have giant warehouses full of GPUs. You can’t just mess around and throw something out there [laughs] and see if it works. Maybe it requires some amount of advanced planning for something on that scale. I don’t know. I don’t know what he meant by it, and I also don’t know what it’s like inside OpenAI, really. I don’t know either.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Do you still take a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html">dim view of solo founders</a>?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, it’s harder. I know I wouldn’t start a start-up alone because it’s just so much weight to bear to do something like that.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But it’s very hard to find a partner as good as you are, right? It’s harder and it’s easier. You <em>can</em> just do it.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, people should do some work. When I talk to people who are in their teens or early 20s about starting a start-up, I tell them, “Instead of sitting around thinking of start-up ideas, you should be working with other people on projects. Then, you’ll get a start-up idea out of it that you probably never would have thought of, <em>and</em> you’ll get a co-founder too.” I wish people would do more of that. You can get co-founders — just work with people on projects. You just can’t get co-founders instantly. You’ve got to have some patience.</p>
<h2>On increasing ambition</h2>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Why is there not more ambition in the developed world? Say we wanted to boost ambition by 2X. What’s the actual constraint? What stands in the way?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Boy, what a fabulous question. I wish you’d asked me that an hour ago, so I could have had some time to think about it between now and then.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>[laughs] You’re clearly good at boosting ambition, so you’re pulling on some lever, right? What is it you do?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, okay. How do <em>I</em> do it? People are, for various reasons — for <em>multiple</em> reasons — they’re afraid to think really big. There are multiple reasons. One, it seems overreaching. Two, it seems like it would be an awful lot of work. [laughs]</p>
<p>As an outside person, I’m like an instructor in some fitness class. I can tell someone who’s already working as hard as they can, “All right, push harder.”</p>
<p>[laughter]</p>
<p>It doesn’t cost <em>me</em> any effort. Surprisingly often, as in the fitness class, they <em>are</em> capable of pushing harder. A lot of my secret is just being the person who doesn’t have to actually do the work that I’m suggesting they do.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>How much of what you do is reshuffling their networks? There are people with potential. They’re in semi-average networks —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Wait. That was such an interesting question. We should talk about that some more because that really is an interesting question. Imagine how amazing it would be if <em>all</em> the ambitious people can be more ambitious. That really is an interesting question. There’s got to be more to it than just the fact that I don’t have to do the work.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I think a lot of it is reshuffling networks. You need someone who can identify who should be in a better network. You boost the total size of all networking that goes on, and you make sure those people with potential —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>By reshuffling networks, you mean introducing people to one another?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Of course.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You pull them away from their old peers, who are not good enough for them, and you bring them into new circles, which will raise their sights.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Eh, maybe. That is true. When you read autobiographies, there’s often an effect when people go to some elite university after growing up in the middle of the countryside somewhere. They suddenly become more excited because there’s a critical mass of like-minded people around. But I don’t think that’s the main thing. I mean, that <em>is</em> a big thing.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Think of it as the power of London in the 17th century. The Industrial Revolution happens further north, but the ideas, the science, in or near London, maybe Cambridge.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>And Oxford.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Those are the networks people are brought.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Near London only in the sense that everything in England is near everything else by American standards. It’s not really that London was the center of ideas. There were a lot of smart people there, but things were more spread out. Be careful with English history there.</p>
<p>Back to this idea, though, of how to get people to be more ambitious. It’s not just introducing them to other ambitious people. There is a skill to blowing up ideas, blowing up not in the sense of destroying, like making them bigger. There is a skill to it, to take an idea and say, “Okay, so here’s an idea. How could this be bigger?” There is somewhat of a skill to it.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It’s helping people see their ideas are bigger than they thought.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong><em>Yes</em>. Oh, yes. We often do this in <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/tips-for-yc-interviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/tips-for-yc-interviews/">YC interviews</a>.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>People say you’re especially good at that. This is what the other people say.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, that’s why I’m mulling over what actually goes on, because there is this skill there. The weird thing about YC interviews is, in a sense, they’re a negotiation. In a negotiation, you’re always saying, “Oh, I’m not going to pay a lot for that. It’s terrible. It’s worthless.” Yet in YC interviews, the founders often walk out thinking, “Wow, our idea is a lot better than we thought,” just because of what we do.</p>
<p>You know what we do in YC interviews? We basically start YC, the first 10 minutes of YC <em>is</em> the interview. You see what it’s like to work with people by working with them for 10 minutes, and that’s enough, it turns out.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>So, you think the 11th minute of an interview has very low value.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I’ve thought a lot about where the cutoff is. Like, where’s the point? If you made a graph, what’s your probability of changing your mind after minute number N? After minute number one or two, the probability of changing your mind is pretty high. I would say YC interviews could actually be seven minutes instead of ten minutes, but ten minutes is already almost insultingly short, so we kept it at ten. We could have made it seven.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I think there’s often a threshold of two, and then another threshold at about seven, and after that, it’s very tough for it to flip.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes. Although that doesn’t mean you’re always right.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It could just be, after three hours, you would still be wrong.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>It’s just not going to flip. I didn’t say seven minutes is enough to tell, notice. [laughs] I said seven minutes is the point where you’re probably not going to change your mind.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>If it’s going somewhat badly, and the person is flipping positive at minute six, what is it that’s happening, both in the interview and in you?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>If it changes from two to seven, uh —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Clearly, from zero to one or two, they get over nerves, or they adjust the sound volume. There are plenty of those stories.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>It’s probably that we misunderstood what they’re working on initially.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>So, great idea, bad at presenting it?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, more like they’re near some idea that we’re familiar with, and we just assume they must be doing that idea. And they say, “Oh, no, no, no, we’re not doing <em>that</em>. We’re doing this.” I’m like, “Oh, okay. Thank goodness.” Then, they get extra points because not only they’re not doing the stupid thing, but they understand that the stupid thing is stupid. They get extra credit for what we were subtracting for it in the past.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Who falls through the cracks in the YC process, as you’ve experienced it?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, YC — one of the reasons I’m so contemptuous of university admissions is that I am <em>also</em> in the admissions business. I am obsessed. [laughs] We not only measure when we fail, but we’re obsessed with the failure cases. YC has a list of all the companies that we’ve missed, that <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/buffers-y-combinator-application/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://buffer.com/resources/buffers-y-combinator-application/">have applied to YC and we’ve turned down, and they’ve gone on to be successful</a>. We spend a <em>lot</em> of time, like someone thinking about past injuries.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>What’s the common element, though, now that you think of it?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>When there are common elements, my God, do we act quickly to fix that. I remember early on, there was this company doing email, if you wanted to send mass emails. I forget what their name was. This was back when we were reading the applications. If the first reader gave it a sufficiently low grade, it would never be seen by anybody else.</p>
<p>The first reader was <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/aap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/aap.html">Robert Morris</a>. He was designated wet blanket of YC. He gave this application a C, with the comment “spam company.”</p>
<p>[laughter]</p>
<p>Nobody ever saw it again. They ended up going public. After that, I changed that thing in the software that made it so that no second reader would see it. After that, <em>every</em> application had to be seen by at least two people.</p>
<h2>On getting over the fear of&nbsp;flying</h2>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>How did you get over your fear of flying?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, really? Did I already talk about this? Do you know the answer to this?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>There are two or three places in your writing where you mentioned that you had a fear of flying, but you used the past tense, which implies you got over it, but you never told anyone how.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, it’s a bizarre strategy. I learned how to hang glide, which sounds crazy.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>[laughs] That will do it, though, right?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>If you’re afraid of flying, how could you learn how to hang glide? The answer is, you learn how to hang glide gradually. You start by just running along the flat. If there’s a headwind, maybe you feel a little lift. Then you go 10 feet up the hill, run as fast as you can, and you reach a total altitude above ground level of like a foot. You’re not afraid when you’re a foot above the ground. You go out a little further up the hill until a month later, you’re jumping off a cliff with a hang glider on your back.</p>
<p>After I was good at hang gliding, I took flying lessons. There’s this intermediate point where I was totally comfortable jumping off a cliff with a hang glider on my back, moderately comfortable flying a Cessna 172 — where the instructor had just turned off the engine [laughs] and said, “Okay, land it,” because the glide ratio is actually similar to a hang glider — and still afraid of getting on an airliner.</p>
<p>That shows you how irrational these things are. But when I finally did get on an airliner, my God, it was like a spaceship [laughs] compared to the planes I’d been flying. It was fabulous. It totally worked. My fear of flying was completely cured.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>What did you learn about start-ups and talent selection from that process?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Boy, if I learned anything, I haven’t considered it until this moment.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But you might have learned it quite well, just not articulated it.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I don’t know. You ask me these hard questions. I don’t have time to think about them. I don’t think I’ve ever <em>consciously</em> used anything I learned there. It was certainly convenient to be able to —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Do you see founders who go through a comparable process with something other than flying, and it’s like, “Oh, I get where you’re at, and here’s what you need to do next.”</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes, a lot of technical-type founders hate the idea of doing sales and going and talking to people, and so you can tell them, “Look, just go do this.” You know, after a few months, they’ll be used to it. They may never like it. I would hate doing that myself now, but they can at least do it.</p>
<h2>On Florence</h2>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Were the Medici good venture capitalists, or do you give greater credit to the Florentine guilds?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I have no idea. I need to learn more about the —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>The guilds would run competitions. The Medici would just pick the people they liked. They both have good records in different ways, but obviously, they’re competing models.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>You’re an economist. You’ve read books about this stuff. I don’t know. What do I know about the Medici? [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I think the Medici were overrated, and the guilds were more important, but that’s a debatable view. You could argue it either way.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>They could well be overrated. They were the ones who had all the publicity. I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Your time spent at <a href="https://www.risd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.risd.edu/">RISD</a> and in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_di_Belle_Arti_di_Firenze" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_di_Belle_Arti_di_Firenze">Florence</a> — how did it alter or affect your thoughts on software design and talent selection?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Man, if you asked how it affected my ideas about <em>painting</em>, I can give you an answer.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>We’ll get to that, but Florence was all about talent selection because how many people in quite a small area became both great and famous?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>One thing I remember — there was one moment I was sitting in Florence, and I realized I had gone to the wrong place. Because I was studying Florentine history, all the buildings are right around you, and I found myself thinking, “Damn, Florence was New York City [laughs] in 1450.”</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>That was 60,000 people, yes.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong><em>That’s</em> why it was good at art. It wasn’t some weird Florentine thing about art or some special Florentine sense of aesthetics. They were just the most progressive city. It’s really too bad that the far left has hijacked that word. It’s such a good word. Maybe we can get it back.</p>
<p>[laughter]</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM:</strong> I remember thinking, “I’ve gone to the wrong place.” I went to the place where the puck used to be over hundreds of years ago. [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You can learn a lot from studying where the puck used to be.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, not really.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>The Academia was a pretty crappy art school.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Being in Florence itself had —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, I can learn a lot from looking at the works, but I don’t have to go and <em>live</em> there.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>What is it you learned that was relevant for Y Combinator? Because you’re doing something comparable to what the Florentines did: picking a pretty small area, making it the absolute center for talent selection, a magnet that drew people in, and having a lot of winners. You copied what you were living.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I had already learned that from Harvard.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Maybe you had to learn it twice. [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, no, no. I was already very well aware of this phenomenon, to the extent YC uses anything like that. We were definitely thinking. YC was started within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">convex hull</a> of Harvard, [laughs] like the places Harvard spread out through Cambridge, but YC’s original office was within it. We’ve consciously tried to make YC the Harvard of start-ups. No question about that. We had the model right there.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Harvard’s very screwed up, as you know. You look at their admissions — how much is <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/18/day-three-harvard-admissions-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/18/day-three-harvard-admissions-trial/">dean’s favorites</a> and <a href="https://www.usnews.com/higher-education/articles/legacy-admissions-what-it-is-and-why-colleges-are-reconsidering-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.usnews.com/higher-education/articles/legacy-admissions-what-it-is-and-why-colleges-are-reconsidering-it">legacies</a> and affirmative action? It’s not Y Combinator. They’re trying to build a coalition, and you’re just caring about picking winners.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>The thing is, though, <em>all</em> universities have an admissions process that’s corrupt in that way, except possibly Caltech. Caltech might actually do undergrad admissions properly. So, since they’re all messed up, Harvard does still have this draw compared to the others.</p>
<h2>On AI and&nbsp;painting</h2>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Does AI make programming even more like painting?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>God, what a question. How do you make these questions? Does AI make programming more like painting? I have no reason to believe that. [laughs] It might be true.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You’re piecing things together more, arguably, in this new post-GPT world.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, what I was seeing when I said <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">programming was like painting</a> is that they’re both building something. You’re not building something any more with AI than when you were writing code by hand, so I would guess not.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>How far is <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F">Midjourney</a> from “real art”?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Is it more decrepit modernism? Is it a fantastic revolution? Or, as art — put aside the start-up angle — how do you view it?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, I see all these AI-generated images, and I don’t know which ones are from Midjourney and which ones aren’t. I can’t say for sure about Midjourney, but I have definitely seen some AI-generated stuff that looks amazing, that looks truly impressive.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>As art. Not just that it looks impressive. It’s amazing as graphic design, but do you think it’s art in the same way that Rembrandt is art?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>This whole thing about what’s art and what isn’t? I think it’s all a matter of degree. My crap carnation coffee mug is art. It’s just not very good art. [laughs] There’s not some threshold, where above this threshold it’s art. Everything people make is art, just to varying degrees of goodness. I can tell you, some of the things I’ve seen that were AI-generated, I’d be impressed if a person made them. <em>That</em> probably is over your threshold.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>If you’re good at talent selection, who is an underrated painter and why?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Ah, wow. [laughs] Boy, there is a topic I think about a lot. There’s a bunch of different reasons people can be underrated. Almost all good artists are underrated.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I agree.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>It sounds weird, but if you look at where the money’s spent at auction, it’s almost all fashionable contemporary crap <em>because</em> if you think about how prices in very high-end art are set, they’re auction prices. How many people does it take to generate an auction price? <em>Two</em>. Just two. So, you have boneheaded <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/sanctioned-the-role-of-russian-oligarchs-in-the-art-market/a-61150603" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.dw.com/en/sanctioned-the-role-of-russian-oligarchs-in-the-art-market/a-61150603">Russians</a> who want to have a Picasso on their wall so people will think they’re legit, or hedge fund managers’ wives who’ve been told to buy impressive art to hang in their loft so when people come over, they’ll say, “Oh, look, they’ve got a <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/damien-hirst" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/damien-hirst">Damien Hirst</a>.”</p>
<p>The way art prices at the very high end are set is almost entirely by deeply bogus people, [laughs] which is <em>great</em>, actually. When I was an artist, I used to be annoyed by this. Now that I buy a lot of art at auction, I’m delighted because it means there’s all this money. You see Andy Warhol’s screen prints selling for $90 million.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Yes. Old masters can be, I wouldn’t say cheap, but I would say radically underpriced.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>A couple hundred thousand.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Or even less for some good ones.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes, I know because I buy them. [laughs] I used to be annoyed by this, and now I think it’s the most delightful thing in the world because there’s all this loose money sloshing around, and so-called contemporary art is like this sponge that just absorbs <em>all</em> of it. There’s none left. Some of the things I buy, I am the only bidder. I get it for the reserve price. No one else in the world wants it, or even knows that it’s being sold, so I am delighted about this.</p>
<p>The answer to your question, which artists are undervalued? Essentially, <em>all</em> good artists. The very, very, very famous artists, artists famous enough for Saudis to have heard of them — Leonardo, I would say, is probably not undervalued. But except for the artists who are household names — every elementary school student knows their names — they’re <em>all</em> undervalued.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>If you think that something has gone wrong in the history of art, and you tried to explain that in as few dimensions as possible, what’s your account of what went wrong?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, I can explain this very briefly. Brand and craft became divorced. It used to be that the best artists were the best craftspeople. Once art started to be reproduced in newspapers and magazines and things like that, you could create a brand that wasn’t based on quality.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>So, you think it’s mass media causing the divorce between brand and craft?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>It certainly helps.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Then talent’s responding accordingly. Fundamentally, what went wrong?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>You invent some shtick, right?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Right.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>And then — technically, it’s called a signature style — you paint with this special shtick. If someone can get some ball rolling, some speculative ball rolling, which dealers specialize in, then someone buys the painting with your shtick and hangs it on the wall in their loft in Tribeca. And people come in and say, “Oh, my goodness, that’s a so and so,” which they recognize because they’ve seen this shtick. [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Say, if we have modernism raging in the 1920s, and the ’20s mass media is radio for the most part —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, no, no, newspapers were huge. Modernism was well —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But not for showing paintings, right? There’s no color in the papers. You had to be —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, the 1920s were good enough to make painting like Cezanne fashionable. It was <em>just</em> about getting going in the 1920s.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Why can’t we build good British country homes anymore?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>[laughs]</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Or do you think we can?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, there’s nothing stopping you —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But it doesn’t happen, right?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>— except the planning people. Do you know anything about building houses in England? You just cannot build.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It’s impossibly difficult. It’s one of the worst countries, right?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, it’s the reason it looks so nice here.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>If they had America’s zoning rules here, the entire countryside would be plastered with houses. You wouldn’t have any fields left at all because the difference in value between agricultural and building land — it’s like, God, 100X or something like that, and this place is <em>small</em>.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Yes, but there are new buildings, say, in Cambridge, many other parts of Britain, and the new buildings are not country homes. Yet everyone, on average, is wealthier. Why the change?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Wealthier than where?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Wealthier than Britain in the old days. Even before the railway, you have large numbers of country homes, and most country homes being built when living standards were pathetically low.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>A country house has got to have a certain amount of land around it. You can’t just have them plastered down a street. It would look wrong. You want a different style of architecture or something like that. There is a place where they build big houses.</p>
<p>You know what it is? It’s like when the Macintosh appeared, and you could have whatever font you wanted, right? Most people have bad tastes. In the old days, you had to have a classical-looking house because that was the only way to build houses. In the Victorian period, actually, was when things went wrong. You could have an Italian villa, or wait, no, it could be a Greek temple, or [laughs] something that looked like it was from the Tudor period. Take your pick and mix them together, Greek temple with Tudor bits. It was all over from that point on, really.</p>
<p>It’s not like they build good houses in America either.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>No, neighborhoods are worse yet. There are nice individual homes, but is there any truly beautiful neighborhood built after 1950? Where would it be? In any country, put aside Asia?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, in Palo Alto, there are neighborhoods of houses built by this guy called <a href="https://www.midcenturyhome.com/category/homes/eichler-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.midcenturyhome.com/category/homes/eichler-houses/">Eichler</a>, this developer who hired some of the best midcentury architects. And arguably, those neighborhoods are good, although they messed up the trees.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>When were those built?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>’50s and ’60s.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Okay, but that’s 70 years ago. Now, I mean, we haven’t done anything in 70 years? What’s your model of that?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I’m sure someone is building some good houses somewhere. The point is, you don’t really need to, and so it only happens by accident. The developers mostly are thinking, “We need to just turn this land into houses as soon as possible. The buyers don’t have any taste. We don’t need to sweat that, so we’ll just build random houses that look big and have large master bedrooms. People will buy them. We’ll get our capital back and go on and do the next one.”</p>
<p>They don’t need to be good. Houses don’t need to be good. They didn’t need to be beautiful in the old days, either. It was just technology was so constrained, you didn’t have any choice.</p>
<h2>On traveling back in&nbsp;time</h2>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You get to go back in time. Your health is guaranteed, and you know whichever languages you might need, and you spend six months somewhere safe. Your safety is guaranteed. Where do you choose?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I often think about this question.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You seem like someone who often thinks about this question.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes, sadly, the way I think about it is, I keep trying to escape from the obvious answer, and I don’t manage to, because the obvious answer to that is Athens, right? Which is, that’s where everyone would pick.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It’s not what <em>I</em> would pick, but what’s your choice number two, then? I’ll tell you mine, I think.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, there are things where I am obsessed with the mystery of what the hell was going on in Dark Age Europe. I’m deliberately using the term “Dark Age” because they’re trying to outlaw it. [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It’s correct, I think.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>If the term “Dark Ages” hadn’t been invented already, that would be a fabulous invention to describe that period. Yes, sure, new things were getting invented. Some people were doing good things just like always happens. But it was as bad as things have been. There are so few records, nobody knows how things happened.</p>
<p>I would be really interested to know when barbarians infilled the Roman Empire, but there were still big Roman landholders, and they had to give a large percentage of their estates to these new barbarians, who were in a sense running things. They were in the cockpit, but they didn’t know what the buttons did.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You want to go to Northumbria or northern France? Or where do you want to be?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, no.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Dark Ages — you’ve picked the era, now give us the spot.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Like Provence.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Provence?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Provence in 600. What was going on? What was going on in Provence in 600? I would be <em>very</em> interested to see that. Almost like morbid curiosity. I wouldn’t learn as much as I would in going to Athens, [laughs] but I just really want to know what was going on.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I’m a big fan of morbid curiosity, by the way. It’s the best kind of curiosity, in many cases.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I would pick the Aztec Empire before the Spanish arrived. I feel I have vague glimpses of what ancient Athens was like. There are still Greek ruins. The Europeans marveled at the cities they saw, and they burnt all the books, and I think I would learn more by somewhere more strange.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Maybe, maybe. The reason I’m interested in medieval Europe is, it’s where our world came from — the clocks we use, the writing system, all the clothes eventually evolved from that. The reason I’m interested — I long ago realized that the medieval period wasn’t a dip. It wasn’t like there was this high level of civilization, and then it dropped down for a while, and then it rose back up again.</p>
<p>It was more like there was one civilization that was high and went down, and another civilization based in the north that rose up. In a sense, it was the beginning of everything. That’s why I want to know what the hell was going on in 600 or 700.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Did Rome have to fall? Or can you imagine a path where Rome has an industrial revolution, and we save ourselves 700 or however many centuries of time? Like you need the fragmentation to get the competition for Britain to become significant?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Maybe, maybe. I don’t know. Oh, 2,000 years is a long time, or even 1,700 years. Actually, Roman was half decent —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Because China never falls.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>— until 200, so, 1,500 years. But 1,500 years — things could have changed a lot.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But did they in China? Chinese Empire never collapses. It takes many forms, many dynasties, but it ends up stalling. So maybe the collapse of the Roman Empire was one of the best things that could have happened, for Europe, at least.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I’m sure people didn’t think so at the time. People were thinking at the time, “It didn’t have to be <em>this</em> bad.” [laughs] I don’t know. Neither of us knows about this kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Looking forward, how optimistic are you about the future of the UK? No real wage growth since 2008, no real productivity growth for as many years. What’s up, and what’s the path out of that?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I am optimistic because they still have a gear that they haven’t shifted into. I suppose I’ll really have gotten native when I say “we” instead of “they.”</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>[laughs] But you grew up in Pittsburgh, right? Near Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes, but I’m British by birth.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Does that count? Are you really British, or your parents were diplomats here?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, no, no. Yes, I’m really British.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You’re really British?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes, yes. Just ask HMRC. As far as they’re concerned, I never left. [laughs] HMRC is the British IRS.</p>
<p>Okay, the reason I’m optimistic about Britain — I was just thinking about this this morning — is because people here are not slack. They’re not lazy, and they’re not stupid, and that’s the most important thing. Eventually, non-lazy, non-stupid people will prevail.</p>
<p>I’ve funded a couple of start-ups here. You can see, when you introduce these people to the idea of trying to make something grow really fast and have these really big ambitions, it’s like teaching them a foreign language, <em>but</em> they do learn it. They do learn it. It’s not like English people are somehow genetically inferior to Americans. I think they have all that potential still to go. I’m astonished when I see statistics. I think GDP per capita in the UK is only two-thirds of what it is in America.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It’s about the same as Mississippi.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>It’s <em>preposterous</em>, I know. Imagine the potential there. Imagine the potential.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You don’t feel that way about Mississippi, necessarily?</p>
<p>[laughter]</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, I think Mississippi’s probably already up close to its full potential. I don’t know. I’ve never actually been there. I shouldn’t say things like that.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Why and how did so many things here end up undercapitalized? The water utilities, the NHS — it seems to be a consistent pattern. That could make us more pessimistic because the flow numbers don’t reflect the fact that <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-maintenance.asp#:~:text=Capital%20maintenance%2C%20also%20known%20as,its%20capital%20has%20been%20maintained." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-maintenance.asp#:~:text=Capital%20maintenance%2C%20also%20known%20as,its%20capital%20has%20been%20maintained.">capital maintenance</a> is even worse than we had thought.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I don’t know. You’re an economist. I don’t know what the term <em>capital maintenance</em> means.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But you’re a British person, I’m told.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Undercapitalized — I don’t know what these things mean.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>They’ve been postponed.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>The NHS is run by the government, so things run by governments are often bad. Although the NHS seems to be pretty good. Even though people attack it, it’s a lot more civilized than the American system.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>How long it takes an ambulance to arrive if you call one up?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, that’s only recently got bad. That’s just in the last couple of years.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>That’s what undercapitalization means. You keep on borrowing against the future. You don’t plow resources back in, and then at some point you don’t have anymore.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Actually, when things get bad enough, they fix things. <em>This</em> place is not run by the kind of yahoos that America is. It may be a small country, but people running things — they’re not just boneheaded political appointees. [laughs] When things are wrong, they notice they’re wrong, and they fix them. This is a very old country. That’s another reason it’s not going to tank. They’ve been through some bad stuff before. There have been ups and downs.</p>
<h2>On optimism for San Francisco</h2>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Are you an optimist about the <em>city</em> of San Francisco? Not the area, the city.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong><em>Yes</em>, I am.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Tell us why.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I can’t tell you because there are all sorts of things happening behind the scenes to fix the problem.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>In politics, you mean, or in tech start-ups?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, no, no, politics. The problems with San Francisco are entirely due to a small number of terrible politicians. It’s all because <a href="https://www.edlee.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.edlee.org/">Ed Lee</a> died. The mayor, Ed Lee, was a reasonable person. Up till the point where Ed Lee died, San Francisco seemed like a utopia. It was like when Gates left Microsoft, and things rapidly reverted to the mean. Although in San Francisco’s case, way below the mean, and so it’s not that it didn’t take that much to ruin San Francisco. It’s really, if you just replaced about five supervisors, San Francisco would be instantly a <em>fabulously</em> better city.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Isn’t it the voters you need to replace? Those people got elected, reelected.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, the reason San Francisco fundamentally is so broken is that the supervisors have so much power, and supervisor elections, you can win by a couple hundred votes. All you need to do is have this hard core of crazy left-wing supporters who will absolutely support you, no matter what, and turn out to vote.</p>
<p>Everybody else is like, “Oh, local election doesn’t matter. I’m not going to bother.” [laughs] It’s a uniquely weird situation that wasn’t really visible. It was always there, but it wasn’t visible until Ed Lee died. Now, we’ve reverted to what that situation produces, which is a disaster.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Now, we’re in 2023. Say, two or three years from now, what do you think the <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/journal/podcast/what-could-ai-regulation-in-the-us-look-like/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAt%20present%2C%20the%20regulation%20of,%2C%20security%20and%20anti%2Ddiscrimination." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/journal/podcast/what-could-ai-regulation-in-the-us-look-like/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAt%20present%2C%20the%20regulation%20of,%2C%20security%20and%20anti%2Ddiscrimination.">regulation of AI</a> will look like?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, God knows. You keep asking me questions I have no idea about.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You have plenty of ideas. You know as much as anyone, I suspect.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, that’s not true. That is not true. [laughs] I really have no idea what AI regulation <em>will</em> look like, or even <em>should</em> look like, which is an easier question.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Here’s an easier question, yes. There is a broadly tech community in the Bay Area.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>If you said I had to make up the regulations for AI this afternoon, it would be really hard.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I agree.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>[laughs] That’s how far away I am from being able to answer that question on the spot. I couldn’t even figure it out in a day.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Like when it should be modular, or when there should be a regulation on AI is a thing that itself is intractable.</p>

<p>— Rob Miles (@robertskmiles) <a href="https://twitter.com/robertskmiles/status/1652333109998678017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I’ll tell you one meta fact though. There was a guy on Twitter — I think his name was <a href="https://twitter.com/robertskmiles/status/1652333109998678017" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://twitter.com/robertskmiles/status/1652333109998678017">Rob Miles</a> — who said that trying to make safe AI will be like trying to make a secure operating system.</p>
<p>That is absolutely true, and therefore frightening, because the way you make a secure operating system is not by sitting down and thinking at a table with a piece of paper about the <em>principles</em> for making a secure operating system. More like you try and make such principles, and then someone hacks your operating system. [laughs] Then you think, “Oh, okay, sorry.” You patch it, and then they hack that.</p>
<p>Making a secure operating system is like making a fraud-proof tax code. It’s basically a series of patches that were based on successful hacks. Is it <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/people/andrew-w-mellon" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/people/andrew-w-mellon">Mellon</a>? They say the US tax code is, basically, a series of responses to things Mellon did.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Some parts of it, yes.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Secure operating systems are like <em>that</em>. I’m worried about AI because you’re not going to be able to figure out — whatever the regulations are, they’ll be wrong, I’ll tell you that. They’ll be overregulated in some ways, and miss and just have huge holes in others.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>There’s a Bay Area tech community. At least in the not-too-distant past, they agreed about many things, but very recently, it seems, on AI, there’s quite a divergence of views. People who are very, very worried: “Oh, it’s going to kill us all in the world.” People who say, “Oh, there are problems, but this is going to be great.”</p>
<p>In as few dimensions as possible, what accounts for that difference in perspective from people with broadly similar backgrounds, and who used to agree on many things? Is it temperament? Is it genes? Is it like a snake bit when —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>It’s probably which aspect of the problem they choose to focus on. You could focus on either one. If you focus on how it could be good, there are all sorts of exciting things to discover, and you discover lots of genuine ways it could be good. If you focus on how it could be bad, it’s true there, too. So it could be either.</p>
<p>I manage to keep both thoughts in my head simultaneously. I simultaneously think there will be all kinds of good things and all kinds of bad things. They will be unimaginably good and unimaginably bad. [laughs] It sounds like that produces oscillation, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>That’s worrying. That in <em>itself</em> is worrying.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Why hasn’t <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">Lisp</a> been more successful? Or do you think it has?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, <a href="https://clojure.org/about/lisp" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://clojure.org/about/lisp">Clojure</a> is a dialect of Lisp, and Clojure’s very successful, so it’s been successful in <em>that</em> respect. There’s another way it’s been successful. Some languages that are not considered dialects of Lisp, like JavaScript — if you showed JavaScript to people in 1970, they would say, “This is a Lisp. Except for the syntax, this is a Lisp.” It’s literally successful through Clojure. It’s de facto successful through JavaScript.</p>
<p>But why doesn’t everybody use Clojure or some other dialect of Lisp? Because the notation is frightening. There’s an initial hump with the notation, and if you give people initial hump — you must know about this. There must be names for this in economics.</p>
<p>If you put some sort of obstacle, like a container, right in front of people’s front door, they’ll go off to the left, and then they won’t go right back in front of the container and resume their original path. No, they’ll take this other path that goes miles out of their way, just because of that one block in front of their front door. The syntax, the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ReversePolishNotation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ReversePolishNotation.html">reverse Polish notation</a>, puts people off.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Is AI-generated programming going to vindicate you on Lisp over time, or cousins of Lisp?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, no.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Because the AI doesn’t care about the notation, right?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>It <em>does</em>.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It does?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM:</strong> Because it’s trained based on the amount of code that’s out there.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But you could train it on something more like Lisp if you wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>You can’t. You have to train on <em>actual</em> examples people have written.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But you have AI write some code in a perpetual motion machine, train other AIs on that code, and converge to something better, better, better. No?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>There was some research paper recently, where they trained an AI on the output of AIs, and it converges on crap. Maybe there’ll be some solution because it is a very rapidly evolving field, but I think you have to have a large corpus, initially, of examples written in the language.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Other than hackers and hacking, what other human activities are what you have called <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html#:~:text=The%20cost%20of%20an%20interruption,on%20hard%20problems%20at%20all." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html#:~:text=The%20cost%20of%20an%20interruption,on%20hard%20problems%20at%20all.">high-cost interruption</a>? That is, if you’re interrupted, you lose your train of thought, have to start all over again.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, math, I think must be like that. I think <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Painting — yes, or no?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Not as much in my experience, not as much. You don’t have to think ahead as much in painting. It’s annoying to be interrupted, no matter what, but it doesn’t absolutely destroy you, like it does in the middle of writing a program or something. You don’t build a big mental model of something in your head when you’re painting. That’s what it is. It’s when you’ve got this giant house of cards in your head. That’s when you get destroyed by an interruption.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Do you think kids today spend too much or too little time learning high-cost interruption activities?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Do they spend too much or too little time working —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Like, are we underinvesting in high-cost interruption activities?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, if you think about what it’s like in schools, kids are <em>constantly</em> being interrupted, and they always have been.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN:</strong> Of course.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM:</strong> So, whatever the answer is, it’s not going to be kids <em>these</em> days. It will be a statement about school for centuries. Kids have such short attention spans. The one thing they can’t do is things that are big and long. I think if you said, “Okay, you have five hours to sit in a quiet room and build something,” I don’t think they’d be up to it, anyway.</p>
<h2>On the Paul Graham production function</h2>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Our last segment is what I call the Paul Graham production function, which is how you got to be Paul Graham. Would you major in philosophy again at Cornell, if you were doing it all over?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, I would not major in philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Why not? Didn’t it allow you to think at a very general level?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, it’s hard to say. It’s hard to say. It’s good to be able to take ideas and flip them around like a Rubik’s Cube, and take them apart, and notice the two parts are the same shape or something like that, but I don’t think I actually learned that in philosophy classes. I think I would’ve learned that in classes about anything hard.</p>
<p>I mistakenly thought that you could just go and learn the most abstract truths. It sounds great to a high school student. “Why do I have to learn all the specific crap? I’ll just learn the most general truths.” Needless to say, that’s one of those things that sounds too good to be true, and it is, because if you go and look in philosophy classes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>I remember when Bill Clinton was saying, “It depends on what the meaning of ‘is’ is.” I’m like, “Hey, that’s what I majored in, [laughs] what the meaning of ‘is’ is, literally.” I think it was pretty much a waste.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Which kinds of ideas come more naturally to you while you’re walking?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Which kinds?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Yes. Maybe not painting ideas, but some kind of ideas, because you’ve written about how using walking to learn ideas is a good thing, but which kinds of ideas? There’s cross-sectional variation, right?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes. Well, ideas about whatever you’re thinking about. I remember, until a few years ago, I was working very intensely on programming. I had the problem I was working on loaded into my head, and whenever I was doing something without any interruptions, I would start to think about that, so I think it’s good for whatever you happen to be thinking about. Mathematicians, apparently, walk a lot.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I find it best for learning from what the other person knows, not so good from my own ideas. It’s better —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>What, when you’re walking with someone else?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>With someone else, and I’m talking with them, and I learn from them better. I don’t find that I’m very generative when I’m walking.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Walking makes all kinds of thinking better. I’ve seen images — like MRI images or something like that — of brain activity. I don’t know how they do MRI images, [laughs] but some kind of images of brain activity. <a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/publications/neuroscience/walking-gives-the-brain-a-step-up-in-function-for-some" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/publications/neuroscience/walking-gives-the-brain-a-step-up-in-function-for-some">Your brain is definitely more active when you’re walking</a>. Classic YC office hours were to walk down the block and talk as you walk, which also has the side benefit that you are side-by-side, and not looking the other person in the face, which I <em>think</em> may be better. It’s certainly better than —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It’s less threatening. It’s like confession in the church. You don’t see the priest. Or you’re on a therapist’s couch — probably you’re not looking right at them, and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Or you’re driving your kid back to boarding school. You’re taking kids —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>And they’ll say things they would not otherwise have told you.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Or talk at all. [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>What are the best environments for learning while walking? Urban, British countryside, or —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>How do you optimize this dose?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I actually have —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I think Britain is wonderful for learning while walking because it’s never too hot. You heat up while you’re walking.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>It doesn’t pour with rain on you like it did today? I was drenched today.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It ends in four minutes. You can bring an umbrella. You run to the gazebo, but there is a gazebo.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>There was no gazebo where I was this morning.</p>
<p>I think it’s good to always walk in the same place. You don’t want to see things that distract you. If you’re trying to have ideas, you’re not going to get ideas from things you see. Probably not. Not relevant ones. You want to walk in the same place, and it should be something where there’re no distractions, so I would think the countryside. Where I go walk is on this preserved medieval common — to an American, it would look like a large park — and it’s the perfect thing. I just always take the same route. There’s not much on it. [laughs] I see grass and trees. That’s about it.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>What’s the most important thing you’ve learned about <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1660204056244105217" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1660204056244105217">soundproofing</a>?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Boy, there’s a good question. I’ve learned a few things about soundproofing. Can I only say one thing?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>One thing is fine. The most important.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, no. You said, “What’s <em>the</em> most important?” Can I say some more?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Oh, no. You can say more than one.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Okay. Well, one is that sound comes through holes. It doesn’t come through your walls; it comes through your windows, probably, in most places. If you fix the holes, you fix the noise problem.</p>
<p>The other thing I’ve learned is basically, the solution — it’s either multiple layers, in the case of windows, or simply mass. You make some big, thick door, and make it have hinges that make it sink down. That’s what recording studios have. When the door opens, it rises up a little bit, and when it closes, it goes <em>shoomp</em> right down onto the floor.</p>
<p>So, great big, heavy doors, multiple-paned windows. <em>And</em>, weirdly enough, I’ve managed to soundproof some places so effectively that I’ve noticed this phenomenon you only notice with soundproofing — all kinds of things make annoying noises you never noticed before.</p>
<p>[laughter]</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>That’s right. It’s a war of attrition of sorts.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes, exactly. Soundproofing is worth it, though. Quiet is really good, at least for me.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>There’s an optimal level of fame. Do you feel you have too much or too little?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>What is the optimal level of fame? I suppose it’s when you can get resources you need or something like that, or if there’s someone you need to talk to, they’ll talk to you. I can now talk to most people I need to talk to. If I want to talk to somebody, I can find somebody who will introduce me, so that must be enough.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Are you past the optimal?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I don’t know. That’s the thing. This sounds very arrogant, but I realized this with Y Combinator. I realized that Y Combinator had become famous long after it had become famous. As far as I was concerned, I was just doing what we’d always been doing. Every six months, we would get all these applications. We’d have to find the needle in the haystack, [laughs] get all these start-ups, help them grow, find investors for them, and then it would start again.</p>
<p>It didn’t <em>seem</em> like YC was any different. It was the same building, the same people. We would get more start-ups. Meanwhile, YC was starting to be considered as this giant gatekeeper for Silicon Valley or something like that.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But Jessica knew it was different, right?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>You’re not aware. Famous people don’t know how famous they are, unless they’re experts on it, like movie stars or something like that. They’re always basically taken by surprise. We were especially taken by surprise because the thing is, the companies we funded would grow until they had thousands of employees, but YC <em>itself</em> didn’t grow.</p>
<p>YC’s market-wise — the value of the portfolio grew with these giant companies, but we didn’t see it. We were still just a few people doing the same thing we’d always been doing, so how could we be famous? I discovered that was one of the biggest mistakes I made with YC. I didn’t realize how many people were watching us. I thought we could just keep doing what we were doing, and nothing really mattered.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Why was that a mistake, per se? Maybe it was better being oblivious.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, because when — basically, anybody outside Silicon Valley who wants to blame Silicon Valley for something, well, who do they blame? They’ve never heard of the people who are <em>actually</em> powerful in Silicon Valley. They only know a handful of people who have consumer brands, me among them. Basically, the world sucks because of tech, and tech sucks because of Paul Graham, [laughs] because they’ve never heard of any of the other people.</p>
<p>I don’t seem to get quite so much of that anymore. I don’t know. I’m glad about that. With YC, definitely, I didn’t know how prominent YC was becoming, and how many people would be out to get us as a result.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Very last question. In my view, a life properly lived is learn, learn, learn all the time.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>That’s what <a href="https://cmqinvesting.substack.com/p/charlie-munger-learning-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://cmqinvesting.substack.com/p/charlie-munger-learning-guide">Charlie Munger</a> said, right?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Yes. Now, what have you recently been learning about, other than soundproofing?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, Tintoretto. [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>What are you learning?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, Vasari had a very low opinion of him.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/books/review/collector-of-lives-giorgio-vasari-biography-rowland-charney.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/books/review/collector-of-lives-giorgio-vasari-biography-rowland-charney.html">Vasari</a> is unreliable on most things, right?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I don’t know. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>He way overrated his patrons, the Medici.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes. You have a thing about the Medici, clearly. He said that Tintoretto was too independent-minded, that Tintoretto was a mad genius, and that he would’ve been better if he had constrained his creativity and stayed within the limits of proper art. You know what I mean? A very Florentine sort of idea. I think Tintoretto would have looked down on Vasari as a minor-league artist, but that was interesting. That was interesting to learn that’s how at least some of Tintoretto’s contemporaries viewed him, and Vasari in particular.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>And a Y Combinator co-founder is not going to buy that argument, is he?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Which Y Combinator founder?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Of Vasari’s, that he was too radical, and too off on his own.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, I thought you meant Jessica was and agreed with me about Tintoretto.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Well, there are two of you. Neither of you would agree with Vasari.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I don’t know. I’m now going to look. I never thought about this, but I was just looking at some Tintorettos. I was just in Venice, looking at the <a href="https://www.scuolagrandesanmarco.it/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.scuolagrandesanmarco.it/en/">Scuola Grande di San Marco</a>, where all those Tintorettos are, and they were so dirty. It was hard to tell [laughs] what the paintings actually looked like, [laughs] but I’m going to go look. I’m going to go look and see if they seem freakish.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Paul Graham, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>[laughs] Thank you. Boy, that was so many hard questions.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="incArticle"><h2>Looks like Stable Diffusion is having some major trouble finding its footing. </h2><h2>AI Hole</h2><p>From fundraising <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/17/stability-ai-the-startup-behind-stable-diffusion-raises-101m/">more than $100 million</a> at the end of 2022 to hemorrhaging top talent by mid-2023, Stability AI — the firm that funds and supports development of the open source Stable Diffusion image generator — has had a helluva year.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-08/stability-ai-s-lead-threatened-by-departures-concerns-over-ceo?sref=YfHlo0rL&amp;in_source=embedded-checkout-banner"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a>, the San Francisco-based AI firm has had a bevy of issues, from accusations that its CEO Emad Mostaque doesn't know how to run a business to claims that the company hadn't paid a $70,000 bill.</p><p>Chief among Stability's difficulties is its talent exodus. This summer alone, the firm has seen resignations from its chief operating officer, chief information officer, head of research, and VP of engineering, just to name a few.</p><p>Though Mostaque insists that "churn" is a common practice in startups while trying to establish "cultural fit" between employee and company, interviews with several former and current people involved with the project say the CEO's lofty vision often doesn't match up to the reality of his day-to-day ability as a business leader.</p><h2>Embellishments</h2><p>A particularly eyebrow-raising claim, per multiple unnamed <em>Bloomberg</em> sources, is that the 40-year-old CEO has claimed he was employed as a spy for the British government. He also insists that he's spoken to more than one prime minister about building AI for nation-states.</p><p>This <em>Bloomberg</em> report isn't the first time the CEO's apparent propensity for embellishment has been in the news. Earlier this summer, <em>Forbes</em> published an exposé that highlighted his "<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2023/06/04/stable-diffusion-emad-mostaque-stability-ai-exaggeration/?sh=4d5fd4b075c5">history of exaggeration</a>," and in its opening lines notes that Mostaque's claim that he has a master's degree from Oxford didn't hold up to scrutiny.</p><p>The latest reporting does note&nbsp;that there are multiple lawsuits against the company that seem to pinpoint Mostaque as the problem. Perhaps most salient is the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-13/stability-ai-co-founder-says-he-was-duped-into-selling-stake-in-unicorn-for-100">suit filed last month</a> by Stability AI cofounder Cyrus Hodes, who claimed the CEO convinced him to sell his 15 percent stake in the company for $100 after insisting that the company is "essentially worthless" — a suit that the firm has said is "without merit."</p><p>Big-picture salesmen are, of course, a dime a dozen in Silicon Valley. In some ways, it's difficult to distinguish what sets Mostaque and Stability apart from, say, <a href="https://fortune.com/2015/02/12/elon-musk-lofty-apple-claim/">Elon Musk</a>.</p><p>Case in point: in a statement to <em>Futurism</em>, a Stability representative said that because the company "is in the innovation business," it is "well aware that any time a new path is taken in any field, there will be critics and skeptics."</p><p>"That reality is no different for the field of generative AI, which has taken the world by storm because of its potential to be the greatest disruptor of our time," the statement continued. "Stability AI is the only independent multi-modal AI company in the world. We remain focused on developing the best open language and image models for millions of users worldwide, and our work is just beginning."</p><p>Lofty vision is one thing, though, and losing a bunch of executives within a few months of each other is another. In the end, the real question will be whether Stability can continue to differentiate the software when Midjourney and OpenAI's DALL-E are looming large.</p><p><strong>More on AI startups: </strong><a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-analytics-books-shutdown"><em>Revenge of the Writers: AI Fiction Analysis Site Toppled by Revolt</em></a></p><br></div></div>]]></description>

<p>I personally have dealt with more than two dozen exit ban matters in China. Around half of these were clear, in that the person banned from leaving China was told very explicitly not to leave, and in each case they knew why. The others were quite unclear, and involved people in China who feared they had become subject to an exit ban and people outside China who feared that if they were to go to China, they would never get out.</p>
<p>This post provides an in-depth look at China exit bans – what leads to them, how to assess your risk of being subject to one, and key actions you should take to avoid or address them. With China increasingly using exit bans against foreigners amid geopolitical tensions, practical guidance is essential for companies and individuals doing business in China. Read on for real-world examples, risk analysis steps, protective measures and advice for responding in detention scenarios. Being prepared is crucial before travelling to or spending time in China.</p>
<h3><span id="1_What_Leads_to_China_Exit_Bans"></span>1. What Leads to China Exit Bans?<span></span></h3>
<p>The typical reasons for the Chinese government imposing an exit ban that prohibits a foreigner from leaving China is for allegedly committing a crime, allegedly owing money to a Chinese company, or being in some other sort of dispute with a Chinese company or individual.</p>
<p>It is important that when determining whether you have violated the laws of China, you are actually aware of Chinese laws, and not just basing your determination on the laws of a country like the United States, Japan, or Denmark. You should instead think of countries like China, Iran, and North Korea, and it would also be instructive for you to read <a href="https://harrisbricken.com/chinalawblog/chinese-government-raids-and-shuts-down-a-well-known-american-business-this-is-a-really-big-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chinese Government Raids and Shuts Down a Well-Known American Business. This is a REALLY BIG Deal</a>. The focus of this post is on Chinese government raids and shutdowns, but the core reasons for Chinese government raids and shutdowns is similar to the core reasons for exit bans.</p>
<p>Last year, professors <a href="https://www.cob.calpoly.edu/directory/profile/chris-carr/">Chris Carr</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cob.calpoly.edu/directory/profile/jack-wroldsen/">Jack Wroldsen</a> wrote a guest post for us, entitled <a href="https://harrisbricken.com/chinalawblog/exit-ban-risk-when-doing-business-in-china-hold-em-fold-em-or-return/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exit Ban Risk When Doing Business in China – Hold ‘Em, Fold ‘Em or Return?</a> That post began by discussing the increased trepidation people have about being detained in China, in part due to the newly passed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/world/asia/hong-kong-security-law-explain.html">Hong Kong National Security Law</a> and the tribulations of Canadians <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-58687071">Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor</a>. This fear of being detained in China due to exit bans is definitely still prevalent and I know this because I have been retained to do more “travel to China risk assessments in the last three months than in the last ten years. As the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>&nbsp;reported in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-us-exit-ban-diplomacy-11668357015?mod=Searchresults_pos1&amp;page=1">Dozens of Americans Are Barred from Leaving China, Adding to Tensions</a>:”</p>
<p>Legal experts say virtually any party to a civil dispute in China involving a foreign national can ask local police to add their opponent’s name to a national database of exit bans that police check at every airport, railway station and other border crossing. . . . U.S. authorities say they don’t know how many Americans face exit bans in China, as targets of such bans often fear that involving diplomats could be viewed as provocative and deepen their predicament.</p>
<p>The Carr/Wroldsen article then describes how foreigners in China usually learn they are subject to an exit ban at the airport when the Chinese authorities prevent them from boarding an international flight or crossing the border but otherwise leave the person free to travel within China. They noted that exit bans are distinct from a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3692138">debt or commercial hostage situation (Carr &amp; Harris, 2021)</a> in which the foreigner’s freedom of movement within China is restricted.</p>
<p>The post then discusses the professors’ recent <em>Thunderbird International Business Review</em> article, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4029043">Exit Bans When Doing Business in China,</a> that studied the frequency of China exit bans by using data obtained from the United States, Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada, along cases “from English and Mandarin media.” Their study looked only at exit bans that arose from civil (as opposed to criminal) business disputes “between a foreign businessperson and his or her local Chinese counterpart, where the foreigner was prevented from leaving China.” It did not cover exit ban cases stemming from political motivations or criminal charges.</p>
<p>Per their study, there have been at least 128 China exit ban cases and about a third of those were driven by business disputes. The professors wrote that “it is likely many more of the 128 cases were caused by business disputes, but because much of the data we received from government agencies was provided in aggregate form, we were unable to verify the driving force behind such cases&nbsp; and it mostly involved senior-level executives, though it is not unheard of for juniors at companies to be banned if they are the only company personnel in China.”</p>
<p>The professors also recorded responses to an “admittedly unscientific poll on LinkedIn” regarding the likelihood of foreigners with business ties travelling to China. Per this poll, just under half said they likely would not be willing to go to China. They also received 34 private responses to their poll, and more than 60% of those people were not likely to go to China:</p>
<p>More interesting were the 34 private responses received, where people overall expressed less willingness to return to China than the public responders in (paraphrased) comments like, “I’m concerned with being canceled regardless of how I respond publicly, but here is my private vote.” The 34 private responses were as follows:</p>
<p>Definitely: 5 (15%)</p>
<p>Probably: 8 (24%)</p>
<p>Probably not: 11 (32%)</p>
<p>Definitely not: 10 (29%)</p>
<p>Although these collective responses are not a huge sample size, they are nevertheless indicative of the seemingly growing reticence of some businesspeople to return to China.</p>
<p>See also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/09/china/china-travel-foreigners-arbitrary-detention-hnk-dst-intl/index.html">Westerners are increasingly scared of traveling to China as threat of detention rises</a>.</p>
<p>To quote from professors Carr and Wroldsen’s <a href="https://harrisbricken.com/chinalawblog/exit-ban-risk-when-doing-business-in-china-hold-em-fold-em-or-return/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>, “most exit ban cases probably go unreported because the targets or victims don’t wish to make their situation with Chinese authorities or their local business partner even worse, so our early research results likely only highlight the tip of the exit ban iceberg.”</p>
<h3><span id="2_How_to_Determine_if_you_are_Subject_to_a_China_Exit_Ban"></span><strong>2. How to Determine if you are Subject to a China Exit Ban&nbsp;</strong><span></span></h3>
<p>In the last ten years, I have been called or emailed close to 100 times by people wanting to retain our law firm to determine whether they are subject to a China exit ban. These communications were probably evenly split between those who were in China and concerned about not being able to get out, and those who were concerned about going to China and not being allowed in (which is technically not an exit ban), or being allowed into China and then not being allowed to leave. Many of these people seemed to believe that my law firm could — with one well-placed phone call — determine whether they were subject to a China exit ban.</p>
<p>For those in China, we would give advice that might range from how to resolve the business dispute that might be causing them to be banned from leaving China, and then try to leave. We often have a number of additional suggestions, which I am not going to&nbsp; reveal here.</p>
<p>For those outside China, we would most of the time say they were at risk of being banned from leaving China were they to go there and they should not go to China because of these risks. We would suggest having their meeting in Hong Kong (we no longer suggest that, for obvious reasons) or some country other than China.</p>
<p>Of those we told not to go to China, I am guessing 3-4 of those people went and were able to leave without a problem. In one instance — where we emphatically told this company that none of its personnel should go to China, someone from this company insisted on going to China anyway and ended up being held hostage. This person was held hostage for five days in a high-end U.S. hotel room in Qingdao and had to be led out of that room and driven to Beijing by what was essentially a swat team we organized to get her out. She was able to fly out of China because she was not subject to an exit ban. I write about this because it makes for a great story and because it highlights how exit bans and hostage taking can overlap.</p>
<h3><span id="3_How_to_Avoid_China_Exit_Bans"></span><strong>3. How to Avoid China Exit Bans</strong><span></span></h3>
<p>The key is to determine whether you should be going to China before you go to China. The key to that determination is knowing your risks.</p>
<p>Do not commit a crime in China. Do not offend anyone in China, especially anyone in the Chinese government. And if you think you might have offended the Chinese government (including with anything you said online from the comfort of a foreign country), do not go to China. Do not have any disputes with anyone in China, and if you do have such a dispute, do not go to China, or leave China immediately. If you are overdue on payment to anyone in China, do not go to China, or leave China immediately.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://harrisbricken.com/chinalawblog/how-to-assess-your-personal-china-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Assess Your Personal China Risks</a>, I set out some factors relevant to assessing China risks and I go through those again below, but with a caveat. The below is not all-inclusive and it is not customized to any company or person’s specific situation. It is also based on what was going on three months ago (when that post was written) and not today. Nonetheless, the below factors are a good think piece for determining your risks, and whether you or your company should be hiring someone for a <a href="https://harrisbricken.com/practice-areas/risk-assessment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more comprehensive and customized risk analysis</a>.</p>
<h3><span id="4_Factors_That_Impact_Personal_China_Risks"></span>4. Factors That Impact Personal China Risks<span></span></h3>
<h4><span id="a_What%E2%80%99s_Been_Said_or_Done"></span><span id="a_What%E2%80%99s_Been_Said_or_Done"></span><strong>a. What’s Been Said or Done</strong><span></span></h4>
<p>You should assume the CCP knows pretty much everything you’ve ever said about China publicly or quasi-publicly (and even some things said privately), specifically including anything said at a college or university, anything said before a China-related NGO, and anything said to one of your Chinese employees. This includes any public government testimony, and it also likely includes you going into a US or EU government office that seeks to contain China. If someone in your company has said something bad about China, everyone in your company is at higher risk. If someone important in your company is known for defending China, everyone in that company is likely at lower risk. Anyone who has worked for anti-China media, or an anti-China think tank, university, political party, or politician is likely at greater risk.</p>
<h4><span id="b_NationalityRaceEthnicityReligion"></span><span id="b_NationalityRaceEthnicityReligion"></span><strong>b. Nationality/Race/Ethnicity/Religion</strong><span></span></h4>
<p><strong>Nationality</strong> influences personal risk. China has a history of mistreating Africans and Filipinos, including arrests for no real reason. People from small countries that China does not like, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93Lithuania_relations#:~:text=On%203%20December%202021%2C%20Lithuania,was%20rejecting%20all%20import%20applications." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lithuania</a>, are at greater risk. People from large countries that China does not like, such as the United States and Japan are at greater risk. People from countries with which China has an “unlimited friendship,” i.e., Russia, are at low risk.</p>
<p><strong>Ethnicity</strong> influences risk. Immediately upon hearing of Russia’s arrest of Evan Gershkovich for spying, I posited he was probably an ethnic Russian, and I was right. See <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-reporter-evan-gershkovich-detained-russia-cd03b0f3">Evan Gershkovich Loved Russia, the Country That Turned on Him</a>, which mentions his “parents fled the Soviet Union.” Russia generally views Russians who have left Russia with varying levels of disdain. So does China. Ethnic Chinese from Canada, the United States, Australia, Chile, France, or wherever, are at greater risk of being arrested or held hostage in China than a Caucasian from those same countries.</p>
<p><strong>Race</strong> is a risk factor, and from what I have seen, Black people (from anywhere) are at greater risk in China. I base this on having seen/heard of a&nbsp; disproportionate number of Black people being arrested in China. Black Americans especially seem at greater risk of being arrested in China for alleged driver disputes, for being in a bar when a fight breaks out, and for cannabis use. I see this as a combination of racism by Chinese citizens who believe they can easily get Chinese police to make these arrests and the willingness of Chinese police to do so. Just as the Chinese government believes there will be less international fallout from arresting an ethnic Chinese person, they also seem to believe there will be less international fallout from arresting a Black person. Frankly (and sadly) they may be right.</p>
<p><strong>Religion</strong> also impacts China risks. People known to be religious and/or involved with a religion the Chinese government particularly dislikes, are at greater risk. If you attend religious services in China, you are at greater risk.</p>
<p><strong>Military/Government Experience. </strong>In 1996, a client-friend of mine <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB832103774494813500">was arrested for no reason in Russia</a>. Upon his arrest, someone (for the life of me, I cannot remember whether it was a mutual friend, someone from his family, or someone from the U.S. Government) called to tell me not to mention that this person had learned Russian at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/academics/centers-initiatives/monterey-initiative-russian-studies">Monterrey Institute</a> or had served in the U.S. military. I stayed silent, but after Russia released my friend, he told me that his Russian interrogators knew everything about him, and they asked him questions regarding all the above to determine whether he would be telling them the truth or not.</p>
<p>Countries like Russia and China love arresting people with government and/or military backgrounds because those backgrounds bolster their claims that the person is a spy and up to no good. Anyone who has served in the military or worked for pretty much any government in any country the CCP dislikes is at greater risk.</p>
<p><strong>Unfriendly Company Experience. </strong>Anyone who has worked for anti-China media, or an anti-China think tank, university, political party, or politician is at greater risk. If your existing employer has high-level personnel the CCP deems unfriendly to China, you are at greater risk. If your employer company is not generating much in the way of jobs or taxes for China, you may be at greater risk. If your employer company is engaged in a business/industry the Chinese government does not like, you are at greater risk. If your employer company does not pay its China taxes or mistreats its Chinese employees or engages in <em>any</em>&nbsp;illegal behavior (no matter how small) and you are high up in the company, you are at greater risk.</p>
<p><strong>Geography and Geopolitics. </strong>People sometimes get arrested in China so the CCP can send an overt message to a foreign country or to China’s own citizens. These arrests are usually in retaliation for something done by a foreign country.</p>
<p>Russia’s recent arrest of Gershkovich (see above) is widely believed to have been to retaliate for the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/03/29/russian-spy-brazilian-student-washington/">United States arresting a Russian on espionage charges</a> and/or for the United States helping Ukraine. Most everyone believes the “two Michaels” from Canada, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_of_Michael_Spavor_and_Michael_Kovrig">Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig</a>, were arrested to retaliate against Canada for arresting <a href="https://harrisbricken.com/chinalawblog/the-chinese-government-is-coming-for-your-company-secrets/">Huawei’s Meng Wanzhou</a>. China’s recent Mintz Group arrests are believed to have been to retaliate against the United States for blocking semiconductor shipments to China and/or for the United States embarrassing China regarding <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/china-spy-balloon-collected-intelligence-us-military-bases-rcna77155" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its spy balloon</a>&nbsp;and/or for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3314089/us-officials-urge-china-not-to-ship-arms-to-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly pressuring China</a>&nbsp;not to arm Russia in its war against Ukraine.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-65085546" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China’s recent arrest of a Japanese businessperson</a>&nbsp;(who, near as I can tell, has yet to be named) is believed to be in retaliation for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/31/tech/japan-china-chip-export-curbs-intl-hnk/index.html">Japan joining with the United States and the EU to block semiconductors from reaching China</a>.</p>
<p>As per&nbsp;<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/The-Nikkei-View/China-must-immediately-release-detained-Japanese-citizen">Nikkei Asia</a>, China has a long history of arresting Japanese businesspeople as a retaliatory measure against Japan:</p>
<p>China has continued to crack down on foreign nationals in the name of national security. Since 2015, at least 17 Japanese citizens have been detained for allegedly engaging in espionage. These individuals range from geological researchers to trading house employees to academics.</p>
<p>The biggest issue is the lack of clarity on where China’s definition of “national security” begins. This opacity makes it impossible for foreign companies to adequately prepare and train their employees for assignments or business trips to China.</p>
<p>If companies are constantly afraid that their employees could be detained at any time, they will have little option but to refrain from sending staff to China. This could eventually lead to less trade and investment between the neighbors. This hurts Beijing, too, by disrupting its plans for steady economic growth.</p>
<p>In 2010, shortly after a Chinese fishing boat captain was arrested in Japan over the collision between his trawler and two&nbsp;Japan Coast Guard vessels, four employees of Japanese construction company Fujita were suddenly detained in China’s Hebei province. Many saw this as a retaliatory move by Beijing. China has taken similar actions with citizens of other countries.</p>
<p>Despite the relatively large number of foreigners arrested or held hostage by China every year (17 people arrested from just Japan for espionage in the last 8 years!), the overall risks for any given foreigner in China is very low, and the above is not meant to imply otherwise. It is meant to help you quantify <em>your</em>&nbsp;risks.</p>
<p>So go ahead and describe China as one giant casino, full of risks. And go ahead and call its legal system rigged, because in many cases it is. But do&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;let anything be an excuse for you not doing whatever you can to&nbsp;<em>reduce&nbsp;</em>your own China risks or to protect your employees there.</p>
<p><strong>5. What to do if you are Banned from Leaving China&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Keep calm.</strong> Try to remain calm and do your best to cooperate with Chinese government officials. Arguing often makes matters worse.</p>
<p><strong>2. Try not to sign anything.</strong> Many years ago, I landed in Qingdao with an expired visa. I was taken to a small room where around five Chinese government officials tried to pressure me into signing a long Chinese language document that I did not fully understand. I was fine with being put on an airplane heading to Seoul, but I did not want to sign the document, and it soon became clear that if I did not sign it, that I would spend a long time in that small, smelly room, so I eventually relented and signed it, but wrote that I was signing it without fully understanding what I was signing and I demanded I be given a copy of the signed version.&nbsp; The Chinese government loves giving foreigners Chinese language documents and requiring that you sign them. If at all possible, do not sign something you do not understand. At a minimum, ask for time to review it and to consult with legal counsel, and if you feel that signing is your best choice, at least make clear that you do not fully understand what you are signing and that you are signing it under duress. And then get a copy of whatever you signed, so you or someone else can interpret it later. Will this help? Who knows, but it is more likely to help than hurt.</p>
<p><strong>3. Say as little as possible.</strong> Report the basics sought by the Chinese government. Thinkg like the purpose of your visit, your employer, and your home country contact info. Do not voluntarily provide excessive details. Anything you say can and will be used against you.</p>
<p><strong>4. You are being watched and recorded.</strong> Assume you are being monitored and recorded, 24/7, no matter where you are. Being circumspect at all times with what you say and do.</p>
<p><strong>5. Ask to speak with your embassy/consulate.</strong> Keep asking for the ability to speak with your country’s embassy/consular staff. China sometimes will allow this, and sometimes not, but it is usually good to ask. I was once picked up by the Vladivostok police for no reason whatsoever (short of wanting me to pay a bribe) and in my meager Russian I kept demanding to be able to talk to my lawyer (I had a friend who was a lawyer there) and to speak with the U.S. consul. I think this led the police to finally release me.</p>
<p><strong>6. Demand the chance to call a lawyer. </strong>Ask repeatedly to be able to speak with a Chinese criminal lawyer. Sometimes this is granted, other times not. There are plenty of excellent criminal lawyers in China.</p>
<p><strong>7. Do not flee China. </strong>In the old days, we would direct people to drive to Vietnam in the trunk of a car, and it worked. Today, China is a high tech police state and your chances of getting caught leaving China are considerably greater, and getting caught will generate a new crime and will likely only make it easier for Chinese government to justify whatever it does to you.</p>
