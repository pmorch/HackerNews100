Pelicans are a group of aquatic birds in the order Pelecaniformes, which also includes the cormorants, darters, and frigatebirds. They are found on all continents except Antarctica, and are known for their distinctive pouch-like bill. There are several species of pelicans. The most common species is the Brown Pelican, which is found in the Americas. It's the only species that plunges into water from a significant height to catch fish and other prey, a behavior known as &quot;fish-grabbing.&quot;  Another common species is the American White Pelican, which can be found in both the Americas and Eurasia. It has a white plumage and a large, bright pink bill, and feeds on fish in lakes, rivers, and coastal wetlands.  Pelicans are generally medium-sized birds, but the Brown Pelican is the largest, with an average height of around 26-30 inches. Their bills can be as long as 11 inches!

    <p>In 2022 I started building an application for creating Customs declarations. After evaluating some options and writing code in various programming languages and frameworks such as .NET/F#, Go, Rust, React, I eventually decided to write it in Ruby on Rails. Why? Because I was already familiar with Rails and because of that I could literally go 10x faster than I was with any of the aforementioned options that were quite new to me. I told myself that this was temporary, a proof of concept and that later on, I would rewrite it in a different language that wouldn't let me shoot myself in the foot as easily as I tend to do with Ruby. The Rails application however quickly grew in functionality and my colleagues really liked the application. I could quickly build features that would make them more productive and prevent a ton of things that could go wrong (and often did initially go wrong, until I wrote some code to prevent it).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I started building "version 2" of the application. I chose Rust as the language for the backend and SvelteKit for the frontend. Initially, the new version looked great, was <em>blazing fast</em>, but only had about 10% of the required features. As Rust doesn't really have anything comparable to Rails, I ended up having to do a lot of plumbing instead of writing business code. After a while, it became obvious that I could never write a feature complete version 2 without completely freezing version 1. So version 2 got thrown in the bin. Maybe this experience taught me something: rewriting something seems to take about as long as writing the original thing in the first place.</p>
<p>Was this the end of the story? Absolutely not. Having experienced the joy of Rust, with beautifully typed code and <em>blazing fast</em> performance, the feeling of confidence you get when something compiles without errors, I knew I had to have Rust in the application. Despite over four years with Ruby, I still regularly wrote code that had issues at runtime. Mostly issues with null values and unhandled exceptions. After each deploy, I would closely watch the error reporting tools and quickly fix any issues that would occur in production. Rust just seemed like a necessity with its lack of null and making it easy for you to handle all errors. And I always enjoy learning new things and finding better ways of writing software.</p>
<p>Besides Ruby on the backend, I was also getting a bit frustrated with frontend in Rails, having logic and markup spread across different files. Svelte just made that so much easier with related logic grouped in a single file. The decision was thus ti slowly write new parts of the frontend in SvelteKit and backend in Rust. Then slowly rewrite the existing Rails parts as well and eventually substitute Rails completely.</p>
<p>This idea looked to be off to a great start. It didn't take long to move all the "index" pages with lists of records and filters to the new stack. And it was <em>blazing fast</em> and (at least the Rust part) barely had any issues at runtime. Deployment got a bit messy with a lot of rules for which routes would go to Rails, Rust or SvelteKit, but hey, it would only be temporary until everything was rewritten and awesome.</p>
<p>However, as time went on, the Rails parts slowly got useful new features and the existing features got deeper and more refined. I performed various refactors to fix wrong assumptions I made very early on. Having a well designed database schema would benefit any version of the application, so this was good. I decided not to spend any more time updating the Rails UI as it would be replaced <em>soon</em>™ anyway.</p>
<p>This went on for months and months, and the business was successful enough that we could afford to employ a full time developer. This would be great and would surely speed up the migration to Rust domination.</p>
<p>It is good to dream big, I guess. And a big dream it surely was. In reality, I spent a lot of time writing abstractions and mechanisms for accessing the database, to ensure that users could only see the data they are allowed to see, keeping track of all changes, search and filters and using the type system to enforce it all. Then I realized I would also need background jobs, a pub/sub system for pushing updates to the client, e-mail capabilities, OAuth 2.0 support for connecting with external services, SMTP and POP, object storage, PDF generation and more. While there are plenty of Rust libraries available for doing all of these, selecting the right one and wiring everything together was a lot of work. We were having a lot of discussions avout technical implementation details, what ORMs for Rust might be useful, when Svelte 5 would come out and how much better it would be, and so on.</p>
<p>After probably a good year of writing Rust and Svelte, it dawned on me that our users didn't benefit from any of this. Sure, parts of the application were now very sleek and <em>blazing fast</em>, but to be honest, those parts were never an issue to begin with. The most used pages were still running Rails and they often did 10x more than the current state of the "beta version" of that same page, written in the new stack. With days and often weeks on end being spent on adding absolutely no direct value, I had to keep telling myself that it was an investment, and that it would pay off in the long run.</p>
<p>And then I called BS on myself. Some investments are just dumb and will not work out, no matter how hard you want things to succeed. I was getting stressed because our users needed stuff that I wasn't building for them. And I was getting more stressed just thinking about the sheer amount of stuff that still had to be (re)written in Rust. I was still the only person on the team maintaining the Rails app, the rest was only familiar with Rust and Svelte. The application became rather complicated, with many changes to be made in multiple places if you just wanted to make a small change. There was only one reasonable decision to be made.</p>
<p>We had to Rewrite it in Rails. Well, not the <em>whole</em> thing, just the parts that were now running on the "new" stack. And the rest of the team would have to start learning Rails, I guess, whether they would like it or not. Even though in my opinion, this was the only good decision, it was still a very hard one to make. After all, we had spent so much time and wrote so much code, only to just throw it all away? And even potentially alienate the people on the team who may not even like Ruby or Rails? Luckily, the team seemed to understand the decision and was open to learn new things. Well, I wouldn't blame them if they would end up not enjoying it at all, but hopefully they'll give it an honest try at least.</p>
<p>What makes Rails so good then, that it is apparently better than Rust of all things and Svelte with TypeScript, the darling of web developers everywhere? Perhaps being the foundation for several hugely successful companies, who still contribute to it as much as ever, counts for something. Rails has lots of batteries included and the ecosystem consists of many mature and stable libraries to complement it. It let me focus on building the product instead of writing all of the supporting code underneath. And due to its opinionated design and conventions, it is often very concise compared to other languages and frameworks.</p>
<p>Was the attempt at using different languages and frameworks a waste then? I personally don't think so. First of all, I've learned a lot. I always enjoy learning new things and learning a new programming language or framework often gives me a lot of new insights and ideas that make me a better programmer in any language (or at least I'd like to think so).</p>
<p>More importantly, I learned that  writing a web application is all about making tradeoffs. There are a lot of decisions to be made and no choice will be perfect. You either have to accept the flaws of your chosen framework or do the investment of writing things yourself. But you have to consider whether that investment will really give you a competitive advantage and whether it will really pay off over time.</p>
<p>In this case, I think it was a great decision to go back to building everything in Rails. Rewriting a lot of stuff back to Rails was frankly rather trivial and it reduced a lot of stress for me. What's more, these last weeks I've felt very productive again, building new features, improving existing ones, updating the UI, fixing stupid bugs. I also really enjoy working more closely with my colleagues who use the application all day, every day and figuring out how I can make the product better for them.</p>
<p>But what about the downsides of Ruby and Rails then? Well, those are simply things to take into account when writing code. Let me give my opinion here. Have many issues at runtime? Test more. Does it turn into unmaintainable spaghetti code after a while? Only if you let it. It's typically caused by developers, not programming languages or frameworks. There are plenty of ways to nicely organize your code and you should probably spend more time refactoring. Rails doesn't scale? I think that if you can't scale Rails, you probably can't scale anything else either. Rails is slow? It is fast enough, and there are plenty of ways to "cheat" with Turbo and caching. Fun fact: the Rust stack wasn't noticably faster for our users. On Rails, the most heavy page has a P95 duration of 338 ms. There is of course room for improvement but it's plenty snappy.</p>
<p>Interestingly, all of the things that used to annoy me about Ruby and Rails now annoy me much, much, much less. I have accepted that there is no perfect language or framework. You just have to know its strengths and weaknesses and deal with them. Luckily, there are some really good frameworks out there for people who want to focus on building a good product. I think Rails is probably one of the best, but there are a lot of other long-lived frameworks with lots of active contributors that are probably just as good. It might still be worth it to choose a more exotic language, framework or to dive in and write your own. If only for the opportunity to learn these kinds of lessons on your own.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>  <p> 2024-10-28 </p> <p>I did the thing you’re not supposed to do. I quit my job at Stripe without another lined up.</p>
<p>Before I left I pondered deeply how I wanted to leave. The thought of leaving my job was terrifying yet energizing in ways I didn’t expect. I found myself up in the middle of the night thinking deeply. I wrote my long-form thoughts as an internal blog post. I rewrote them. I read them to my wife who helped me refine them into something closer to what I really care about: <strong>telling our stories more truly</strong>.</p>
<p>I’d like to share my story more broadly now. Why? Because perhaps there is someone out there wondering if they’re struggling alone.</p>
<p>I’m scared to share this publicly. I’m afraid of how it’ll make me look. I’ve been sitting on this post for months now questioning my motives. At some point you just have to hit the “fuck it” button.</p>
<p>I care about honesty. Hell, one of my <a href="https://jondlm.github.io/website/values">core values</a> is “humbling honesty”. I suppose this is a small way to embody that.</p>
<p>Here’s what I shared internally without any edits:</p>
<hr>
<p>Hi. I’m Jon. I’ve been an engineer at Stripe for almost four years. My last day will be on Friday August 30th. Lately I’ve found myself increasingly drawn toward honest writing. I’d like to offer you the story of my time at Stripe that won’t be found in shipped emails. Let’s start at the beginning.</p>
<p>It was a late Summer afternoon in my home office in Portland Oregon. I was sitting at my desk pouring over my IDE setup to make sure I’d put my best foot forward for my imminent phone screen. TypeScript all configured? Check. Minimal testing framework installed? Mmmhmm. Tmux working? Yup. Tastefully muted terminal colors on display? Like a peacock.</p>
<p>I could feel my palms sweating as I watched the clock slowly tick toward 3pm. I was nervous as hell. I’d already had a successful career as a software engineer for the better part of a decade. I’d initiated and driven a company-wide migration to Kubernetes. I’d authored a component library used by hundreds of engineers. When my previous company had been bought by AT&amp;T I was given one of the highest retainer packages to keep me around. None of that seemed to matter in the build up to my interview. I was about to be closely judged and I was terrified of being found lacking.</p>
<p>My impression of Stripe was astronomically high. I considered it an outstanding company of refined craft, attention to detail, and engineering excellence. I always got ridiculously excited when I’d see a new product launch on Hacker News. I had listened to Patrick on podcasts and admired him as an industry visionary. The word “revered” feels fitting.</p>
<p>I carried all those swirling impressions with me as 3pm hit. My heart was beating so strongly I could feel it in my head. I tried to take some deep breaths but it didn’t help. My mind was racing over every little detail. “I’ll join about 30 seconds after the hour to make sure he knows I’m on-time but not <em>too</em> eager.” I joined the call and my interviewer joined shortly after.</p>
<p>He introduced himself and we settled into the usual ritual of a phone screen. I told him I already had my own environment set up and I shared my screen. “Surely he’ll take note of my meticulous programming setup.” I thought.</p>
<p>He gave me a coderpad link. I started to read through the question. I could already feel my mind moving like molasses. On the surface the question seemed straightforward enough. It presented a simple data structure and asked me to do some filtering based on a set of constraints. “No problem!” I thought.</p>
<p>I fired up vim and got to work. “Since they’re so dedicated to quality I should make sure my types are airtight.” I started modeling my solution with types first. “Hmm, well this question needs dynamic keys in the objects so that’ll mean I need an indexed type. Thank god I remember how to do those without looking them up. Don’t want to appear weak.”</p>
<p>Things were moving rather smoothly despite my sweat soaked armpits. I silently resented my wife’s decision to unilaterally give up anti-perspirant due to chemicals.</p>
<p>I got to a reasonable spot to try out my code. I hit save on the file. My little fsnotify script detected the file change, ran a TypeScript check, then executed my code.</p>
<p>Error. Shit.</p>
<p>As I read the error carefully, I realized I didn’t immediately know the solution. I felt a soupy darkness creep further in on the edges of my mind. I fumbled around for a couple minutes trying to fix it correctly. I was trapped, caged by my own need to appear competent. I could feel my mind racing from idea to idea trying to find a way out. Eventually I looked at the clock and realized we were well into the interview. I had to find a pressure relief valve before the whole thing ran off the rails.</p>
<p>I did the unthinkable. I added a <code>//@ts-ignore</code> comment to bypass the compiler.</p>
<p>“Uh heh, if this were real code obviously I’d figure out the problem. I’ll just bypass this one error and move on for the sake of time.” I said.</p>
<p>I continued down the increasingly treacherous road toward solving the problem. Another error. Another one. More ignore comments. Shit shit shit.</p>
<p>At that point I was hardly present at all. I was falling violently down a hole of self consciousness that felt like a threat to my very existence.</p>
<p>I knew my code was close to working but my mind was gone. I was done for and I knew it. He kindly ended the interview and asked if I had any questions. I bumbled some out but I knew my verdict.</p>
<p>Unqualified. Failure.</p>
<p>We ended the call and I let my head sink into my hands, but only for a moment. An idea sprang to mind. What if I got my code working really quickly and found a way to send it to him?</p>
<p>I hopped over to Chrome and googled his name. All I could find was his Twitter account. At that point I had nothing to lose so it was trivial to solve the problem. Within minutes I threw together a public gist with my working code and DM’d him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t feel like you need to message me back. I just hate leaving a problem unresolved like I did. The code still isn’t ideal but I at least wanted to reach out and send that to you. Thanks again!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I nervously hit the send button and walked away from the computer dejected. Within a couple days I got the email I was expecting.</p>
<p>Rejected.</p>
<p>Eventually I mustered the courage to try interviewing again six months later. I got the job. I was elated. I was extremely proud of the fact that I had gotten a job at Stripe. I even made a little web animation thing to share with my coworkers letting them know where I’d be headed next.</p>
<p>I was the first hire onto the brand new JS Infra team. I hit the ground running trying to prove myself. It took me a long time to find a project where I could clearly demonstrate business value. Before I found that project I constantly struggled with something else: writing.</p>
<p>Writing was difficult for me when I came to Stripe. I had never really written a serious project proposal in my career working at smaller companies. My writing chops felt woefully underdeveloped and the impression only grew as I read through well-crafted ships every day. I  remember a sinking feeling in my chest as I would try to work up the courage to share a link to a document I had agonized over. Worse still was seeing little avatar badges on an incomplete document I was editing. Allowing my unpolished work to be seen was terrifying. I didn’t want anyone to know I struggled. I didn’t want them to know how much their opinions mattered to me.</p>
<p>I’ll circle back to writing in a bit.</p>
<p>About a year into working at Stripe I found my first really impactful project. I worked tirelessly to migrate Dashboard development onto a new JS bundler. I sped up development by about 10x. It was a smashing success.</p>
<p>I remember the moment when my buddy Slacked me saying that my shipped email had been one of Patrick’s tabs in a Friday Fireside. I hadn’t attended because I was too busy trying to work more. My email admired by a billionaire? Bliss. The thought of Patrick noticing me felt unbelievably good. Finally I was proving myself at the company of my dreams. I was on cloud nine.</p>
<p>Until I had my next one on one with my boss. She shared with me some concerns about my communication and project management. She, and apparently others she gathered feedback from, felt like I hadn’t done a good enough job pulling other engineers into the project. She spoke of how proud she was of the outcome but that it didn’t excuse my less than ideal methods.</p>
<p>Performance review time came and I got a partially meets expectations (PME).</p>
<p>“I know it’s probably hard to get this rating after such a successful project. I want to assure you you’re on track toward a solid review next cycle as long as you address the feedback around project management and keep delivering quality stuff like this.” My boss said to me in another one on one.</p>
<p>After the call I crawled into my closet and quietly cried. It was one of the few times I let myself. I felt ashamed and humiliated.</p>
<p>I told my buddies, who referred me to Stripe, about my rating and they were both shocked. They offered kind words but it all felt hollow. Everyone assured me that a PME is a normal occurrence and that they were sure I’d bounce back. It still hurt. Worse still was feeling bad for being affected so deeply by it. “Damn it, Jon, shrug it off and get back to work” I told myself.</p>
<p>I found comradery with one of my old friends on my team. He and I went a long way back and had worked together at a previous employer. We had eaten lunch together for years in a physical office. I allowed myself to be just a little vulnerable with him about how much I was struggling to get back in the saddle. I found our raw conversations to be a small source of life.</p>
<p>I trusted him in a way I didn’t trust my boss. I knew that he cared about me no matter how I was performing at work. Having his avatar beside mine on an unfinished google doc felt invigorating. Together we quickly put together a solid proposal for the next phase of the JS bundler project that we both believed in.</p>
<p>With him in my court I felt less afraid to present the proposal to my boss. I presented it to her and sought feedback. I could intuitively tell she wasn’t impressed. Over time I was able to sus out how she really felt. She thought we should shelve the work in favor of something else more pressing but she was reluctant to say it directly. Eventually I shelved the project proposal in favor of another JS modularity project. She applauded the decision publicly. The whole experience left me feeling dizzy. Regardless, I put my head down and got to work on the new project.</p>
<p>In hindsight the pivot ended up being the right call. I don’t know why my boss wasn’t more straightforward. I never talked directly to her about it. We’re more alike than not.</p>
<p>She was promoted into a more visible role and I got a new manager. I really liked my new manager. He did something right out the gate that suggested he might be a different kind of manager. He sought vulnerability.</p>
<p>During one of his early meetings at a team onsite he asked the team, “for this meeting I’d like us to try and introduce ourselves a little differently. If you’re comfortable, I’d like us to try and be 10% more vulnerable than we normally would in a work setting.” I remember feeling a mix of anxiety and excitement rise in my chest. I sat pondering what I would share. I decided to go for more than 10%. I shared about how my marriage had almost collapsed a couple years prior and a taste of how painful it was. Some of my coworkers shared deeper things I’d never heard in a work setting. It was awkward. It was beautiful.</p>
<p>That memory springs forth from my imagination as I consider my favorite moments at Stripe. It wasn’t my project successes. It wasn’t my shipped email being mentioned by Patrick. It was getting to know the people I work with a little more closely.</p>
<p>Time passed and my new project was another slam dunk. Review time came and I got an exceeds expectations. I was shocked in a good way. More surprising still was how quickly the jolt of motivation from the rating passed. It felt good to be rewarded for my performance but I was increasingly aware of how little I cared for the recognition.</p>
<p>Still more time passed and then came the depression. I found myself increasingly demotivated in all aspects of my life. I could hardly even muster the energy to play video games (my usual haunt). Some evenings I would literally sit and stare at a wall. My sleep went to shit.</p>
<p>I was stunned. I couldn’t recall ever being depressed as an adult. I’d had slumps before but this felt different. I’d experienced something like that as a young teenager but doesn’t time heal all wounds? Apparently not for me. I felt increasingly helpless in the presence of a faceless enemy.</p>
<p>I started noticing that “run” weeks for me often left our backlog larger than when I’d started. The feeling of letting my team down sunk in deeper. It sunk into a place I felt I had no control over. I tried cutting out distractions. I DNS blocked Hacker News and Twitter. I stopped reading google news. That helped a bit but even that failed eventually. I managed to stay off them but I was still depressed.</p>
<p>It was extremely difficult because I really loved my team <em>and</em> the work I was doing. I’d get little moments where my mind felt hydrated. I would briefly get into the flow. Code, documents, and Slack replies to tough questions would stream out of me. It became more and more rare and I knew it. All my tactics were failing. I had to do something more serious.</p>
<p>I did the unthinkable. I told my team I was struggling with depression and took some time off. I remember the feeling in my body leading up to the meeting. My stomach was churning. I felt queasy. “Am I really doing this? Am I really this weak?” were a small sampling of the thoughts running through my head. By that point another possibility had started to take root alongside the others. Perhaps weakness hides the path to what I’m searching for.</p>
<p>My team was extremely supportive. I felt such care and understanding from them it was the second time I let myself shed a tear about something at work. That time I didn’t have to crawl into the closet.</p>
<p>I went back to work. Months passed leading up to the last couple weeks. I’ve found myself again unable to sleep and rest properly. By now I’ve seen the cycle enough to know that another round of relief and invigoration would be only temporary. I’m left with an alternative that excites and terrifies me. It’s time to step without knowing what comes next.</p>
<p>I’ll end with a poem that’s haunted me this year. It’s by the late John O’Donohue from his book <em>To Bless the Space Between Us</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mind of time is hard to read.<br>
We can never predict what it will bring,<br>
Nor even from all that is already gone<br>
Can we say what form it finally takes;<br>
For time gathers its moments secretly.<br>
Often we only know it’s time to change<br>
When a force has built inside the heart<br>
That leaves us uneasy as we are.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the work we do has lost its soul,<br>
Or the love where we once belonged<br>
Calls nothing alive in us anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We drift through this gray, increasing nowhere<br>
Until we stand before a threshold we know<br>
We have to cross to come alive once more.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>May we have the courage to take the step<br>
Into the unknown that beckons us;<br>
Trust that a richer life awaits us there,<br>
That we will lose nothing<br>
But what has already died;<br>
Feel the deeper knowing in us sure<br>
Of all that is about to be born beyond<br>
The pale frames where we stayed confined,<br>
Not realizing how such vacant endurance<br>
Was bleaching our soul’s desire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for listening to my story.</p>
<p>Love,<br>
Jon de la Motte</p> </article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>Description</h3><p>On October 30, 2024, a vulnerability was internally identified in generating the cache key for AD/LDAP DelAuth. The Bcrypt algorithm was used to generate the cache key where we hash a combined string of userId + username + password. During specific conditions, this could allow users to authenticate by only providing the username with the stored cache key of a previous successful authentication.</p><p><b>Note:</b> A precondition for this vulnerability is that the username must be or exceed 52 characters any time a cache key is generated for the user.</p><h3>Affected products and versions</h3><ul><li><p>Okta AD/LDAP DelAuth as of July 23, 2024</p></li></ul><h3>Resolution</h3><p>This vulnerability was resolved in Okta’s production environment on October 30, 2024.</p><h3>Severity Details</h3><p>The vulnerability can be exploited if the agent is down and cannot be reached <b><i>OR</i></b> there is high traffic. This will result in the DelAuth hitting the cache first.</p><h3>Customer Recommendations</h3><p>Customers meeting the preconditions should investigate their org system log for this issue between the period of July 23rd, 2024 to October 30th, 2024.&nbsp;</p><h3>Timeline</h3><p>2024-07-23 - Vulnerability introduced as part of a standard Okta release</p><p>2024-10-30 - Vulnerability discovered internally</p><p>2024-10-30 - Vulnerability resolved by switching cryptographic algorithms, from Bcrypt for PBKDF2</p></div></div>]]></description>

<section><p>Abnormally short and long sleep are associated with premature mortality, and achieving optimal sleep duration has been the focus of sleep health guidelines. Emerging research demonstrates that sleep regularity, the day-to-day consistency of sleep–wake timing, can be a stronger predictor for some health outcomes than sleep duration. The role of sleep regularity in mortality, however, has not been investigated in a large cohort with objective data. We therefore aimed to compare how sleep regularity and duration predicted risk for all-cause and cause-specific mortality. We calculated Sleep Regularity Index (SRI) scores from &gt; 10 million hours of accelerometer data in 60 977 UK Biobank participants (62.8 ± 7.8 years, 55.0% female, median[IQR] SRI: 81.0[73.8–86.3]). Mortality was reported up to 7.8 years after accelerometer recording in 1859 participants (4.84 deaths per 1000 person-years, mean (±SD) follow-up of 6.30 ± 0.83 years). Higher sleep regularity was associated with a 20%–48% lower risk of all-cause mortality (<em>p</em> &lt; .001 to <em>p</em> = 0.004), a 16%–39% lower risk of cancer mortality (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001 to <em>p</em> = 0.017), and a 22%–57% lower risk of cardiometabolic mortality (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001 to <em>p</em> = 0.048), across the top four SRI quintiles compared to the least regular quintile. Results were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health factors. Sleep regularity was a stronger predictor of all-cause mortality than sleep duration, by comparing equivalent mortality models, and by comparing nested SRI-mortality models with and without sleep duration (<em>p</em> = 0.14–0.20). These findings indicate that sleep regularity is an important predictor of mortality risk and is a stronger predictor than sleep duration. Sleep regularity may be a simple, effective target for improving general health and survival.</p></section>

<p>A large body of research has demonstrated that both subjective and objective estimates of average sleep duration are associated with mortality risk [<span id="jumplink-CIT0001 CIT0002 CIT0003 CIT0004 CIT0005 CIT0006 CIT0007 CIT0008 CIT0009"></span>1–9]. Several meta-analyses of subjective sleep duration have associated both short and/or long sleep duration, outside an approximate range of 7–9 hours, with higher risks for all-cause mortality [<span id="jumplink-CIT0001 CIT0002 CIT0003 CIT0004 CIT0005"></span>1–5]. Recently, large studies of objective sleep duration have confirmed these associations of sleep duration with all-cause mortality [<span id="jumplink-CIT0006 CIT0007 CIT0008 CIT0009"></span>6–9]. These findings are supported by results showing associations between sleep duration and many other dimensions of health [<span id="jumplink-CIT0010"></span>10].</p><p>Maintaining optimal sleep duration is the central focus of current sleep health guidelines [<span id="jumplink-CIT0011"></span>11]. Recent evidence, however, indicates that sleep regularity, defined as the day-to-day consistency of sleep–wake timing, is a stronger predictor of some health outcomes than average sleep duration [<span id="jumplink-CIT0012"></span>12, <span id="jumplink-CIT0013"></span>13]. Studies with longitudinal measures of sleep regularity have found associations between irregular sleep and adverse cardiometabolic outcomes [<span id="jumplink-CIT0012"></span>12, <span id="jumplink-CIT0014 CIT0015 CIT0016 CIT0017"></span>14–17], epigenetic aging [<span id="jumplink-CIT0018"></span>18], depressed mood [<span id="jumplink-CIT0019"></span>19], and lower quality of life [<span id="jumplink-CIT0013"></span>13]. People with irregular sleep patterns are exposed to irregular patterns of environmental stimuli, including light, and may have irregularly timed behaviors, such as physical activity and meals. This unstable timing of both stimuli and behaviors leads to disruption of circadian rhythms, with downstream negative health effects [<span id="jumplink-CIT0020"></span>20]. While mortality risk has been associated with self-reported sleep regularity [<span id="jumplink-CIT0021"></span>21], this relationship has not been investigated prospectively in a large cohort with objective sleep data. Furthermore, the relative importance of sleep duration compared with sleep regularity for mortality risk is not known.</p><p>We aimed to assess the relationship of objectively measured sleep regularity with risk for all-cause mortality, and mortality from cardiometabolic causes and cancer, in a large cohort (<em>N</em> = 60 977) who wore accelerometer devices for 1 week. We also assessed whether sleep regularity was a stronger predictor of mortality risk than sleep duration. We used data from our previously reported assessment of sleep regularity in UK Biobank participants [<span id="jumplink-CIT0022"></span>22], where we extracted Sleep Regularity Index (SRI) scores. This metric assesses day-to-day similarity in sleep patterns, accounting for irregularity due to fragmented sleep, napping, and variable sleep onset and offset timing.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="435231429" id="435231429" data-legacy-id="s2">Methods</h2>

<p>A baseline cohort of approximately 502 000 participants aged between 40 and 69 years were recruited to the UK Biobank between 2006 and 2010 [<span id="jumplink-CIT0023"></span>23]. Participants completed an initial assessment at the time of recruitment, designed to capture information across a broad range of health and lifestyle factors, through questionnaires and physical measurements. Assessment centers were located to capture a range of socioeconomic, ethnic, and urban–rural distributions within the UK population. From this baseline cohort, 103 669 participants wore Axivity AX3 devices (Axivity, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) on their dominant wrist for 7 days under free-living conditions between 2013 and 2016. Devices were tri-axial, and logged accelerometer data at 100 Hz. Invitations to participate and devices were distributed via post. Written informed consent was obtained and all data collection was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

<p>Sleep regularity was assessed using the SRI [<span id="jumplink-CIT0024"></span>24], a metric that compares the similarity of sleep patterns from one day to the next. The SRI calculates the average concordance in sleep–wake state of all epoch pairs separated by 24 hours (see <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/sleep/47/1/10.1093_sleep_zsad253/1/zsad253_suppl_supplementary_material.docx?Expires=1733343948&amp;Signature=b~mA1PJ1cgMkViPaqVrgW~V5fb4fV0I4s6yLkcCYQLoRHXEg4ty6-vsrQeo1SQHkGSsyHoPRBIgtAH221bU-MfyiptYbbN-uVX-eu8ybF4mhLXJDjq4ByGvAVDGswCCeKqiRk~Fq-LeUNyPBRAUwW7cjZ27XPcXUcP3AVQQ2oa~rXGOppaRFcBOr8p~OXknCc8tNTdFqRGpFm3-WhE9K8B8lyS1e7xluRiFAEobBGiO~dFseNXbkRmY6M39eoZZRTYExCSh4BHhSAzIUtKonIfRNYmTdYG5jXijem857b8upCEP0us2F0oqyP1eodaycKQI3fkFtFo4iXoX49lEBgQ__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Supplementary Methods S1.7</a></span> for SRI calculation formula). An SRI of 100 represents perfectly regular sleep–wake patterns, and zero represents random patterns.</p><p>SRI scores were derived in this cohort in our previous work [<span id="jumplink-CIT0022"></span>22], and these scores were used in all analyses presented here. SRI scores were calculated using epoch-by-epoch sleep–wake state across each participant’s 1-week recording. Sleep–wake state was estimated using “GGIR”, a validated, widely used open-source R package for estimating sleep–wake from accelerometer data [<span id="jumplink-CIT0025"></span>25, <span id="jumplink-CIT0026"></span>26], and “sleepreg”, an R package developed by our group to accurately calculate SRI scores from “GGIR” output [<span id="jumplink-CIT0022"></span>22]. The “sleepreg” package uses sustained inactivity data to account for naps, fragmented sleep, and large periods of wake during sleep in its calculation of SRI scores, which could not be achieved using “GGIR” summary output alone. This method accounted for device non-wear, and excluded instances of miscalculated sleep onset and offset. It also allowed patterns including more than one sleep episode within a 24-hour period to be accurately represented. Valid SRI scores were calculated in participants with at least 120 hours (i.e., 5 days) of 24-hour-separated epoch pairs after non-wear removal and exclusion of miscalculated days.

Daily sleep durations were extracted in the same study days used to calculate SRI scores, and participant-level average sleep duration was calculated across these days. Similarly, participant-level average mid-sleep timing was calculated from daily mid-sleep, defined as the clock time halfway between sleep onset and sleep offset. Intraindividual variability in sleep onset and offset timing was calculated as the standard deviation of daily sleep onset and offset times for each individual.</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="435231436" id="435231436" data-legacy-id="s5">Mortality records</h3>
<p>Mortality data were received from NHS Digital (England) and NHS Central Register (Scotland). Records include date of death and primary cause of death, diagnosed in accordance with the ICD-10 [<span id="jumplink-CIT0027"></span>27]. Records from June 2013 to March 2021 were included. Cardiometabolic mortality was defined according to ICD-10 diseases of the circulatory system, or endocrine and metabolic diseases (I05-I89, E00-E90). Predominant circulatory causes of death were ischemic heart disease (I20-I25); cerebrovascular diseases (I60-I69); other heart disease (I30-I52); diseases of the arteries, arterioles, and capillaries (I70-I79); and hypertensive diseases (I10-I15). Predominant endocrine and metabolic causes of death were diabetes mellitus (E10-E14); metabolic disorders (E70-E90); and obesity (E65-E68). Cancer was defined as any cause of death by malignant or benign neoplasms (C00-C97, D10-48). Predominant causes of death by cancer were malignant neoplasms of digestive organs (C15-C26); respiratory and intrathoracic organs (C30-C39); lymphoid and hematopoietic tissue (primary; C81-C96); and breast (C50).</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="435231438" id="435231438" data-legacy-id="s6">Covariates</h3>
<p>Average physical activity was defined as average device acceleration across the recording, after exclusion of low-quality data and periods of non-wear, as described in previous work [<span id="jumplink-CIT0028"></span>28], and was derived from the same accelerometer records used to estimate sleep–wake state. Additional covariates were collected during an initial assessment between 2006 and 2010, including: self-reported ethnic background; employment status; yearly household income; Townsend Deprivation Index (average material deprivation of a participant’s residential location); weekly social activities; frequency of social visits; smoking status; urban or rural postcode; rotating shift work status; prescription of medication for hypertension or cholesterol; diagnosis of cancer, diabetes, or vascular conditions; body mass index (BMI); cholesterol ratio; frequency of depressed mood, unenthusiasm/disinterest, tenseness/restlessness, tiredness/lethargy; and visitation to a general practitioner or psychiatrist for mental health concerns.

<p>SRI and sleep duration were split into quintiles. Hazards of mortality were estimated for each of the top four SRI and sleep duration quintiles compared to their respective lowest quintiles, which were hypothesized to have the highest mortality risk. This approach allowed for unspecified non-linearity in sleep/mortality relationships. Hazard ratios for all-cause and cause-specific mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models and competing-risks proportional sub-hazards models [<span id="jumplink-CIT0029"></span>29]. All Cox models used time since accelerometer recording as the timescale. Sleep variables were included as predictors of mortality risk in three separate Cox models, as follows: model 1: SRI, model 2: sleep duration, and model 3: SRI plus sleep duration. Each of these three models were implemented as both “minimally adjusted” and “fully adjusted”, for a total of six models. Minimally adjusted models included age, sex, and ethnicity; and fully adjusted models were additionally adjusted for physical activity, employment, income, deprivation, social activities, social visits, smoking status, urbanicity, shift work status, and use of medication for cholesterol or hypertension (see <span data-supplement-target="sup1"></span><span><a path-from-xml="sup1" href="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/sleep/47/1/10.1093_sleep_zsad253/1/zsad253_suppl_supplementary_material.docx?Expires=1733343948&amp;Signature=b~mA1PJ1cgMkViPaqVrgW~V5fb4fV0I4s6yLkcCYQLoRHXEg4ty6-vsrQeo1SQHkGSsyHoPRBIgtAH221bU-MfyiptYbbN-uVX-eu8ybF4mhLXJDjq4ByGvAVDGswCCeKqiRk~Fq-LeUNyPBRAUwW7cjZ27XPcXUcP3AVQQ2oa~rXGOppaRFcBOr8p~OXknCc8tNTdFqRGpFm3-WhE9K8B8lyS1e7xluRiFAEobBGiO~dFseNXbkRmY6M39eoZZRTYExCSh4BHhSAzIUtKonIfRNYmTdYG5jXijem857b8upCEP0us2F0oqyP1eodaycKQI3fkFtFo4iXoX49lEBgQ__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA">Supplementary Methods S1.5</a></span> for model syntax). All covariates were selected as potential confounders of sleep/mortality relationships. Additional covariates in the fully adjusted models were also possible mediators of sleep/mortality relationships. Akaike Information Criteria was used to compare models 1 and 2 (equivalent SRI-only and sleep duration-only models). Likelihood ratio test was used to compare models 1 and 3 (nested hierarchical models).

Each of the following variables were individually added to fully adjusted models 1–3: mid-sleep timing, cancer diagnosis, diabetes diagnosis, vascular conditions, BMI, cholesterol ratio, depressed mood, unenthusiasm/disinterest, tenseness/restlessness, tiredness/lethargy, and visitation to a GP or psychiatrist for mental health concerns.</p><p>The association between SRI and sleep duration was tested using linear regression, by inclusion of sleep duration as a linear, quadratic, and cubic predictor of SRI in three individual models. Model fit was compared between each of the three models using ANOVA (F-test). Non-linear relationships were tested due to the hypothesis that more irregular sleep would be associated with both shorter and longer sleep, primarily due to sleep restriction and associated recovery sleep.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="435231444" id="435231444" data-legacy-id="s8">Results</h2>

<p>Our analyses included 60 997 participants with valid SRI scores. The SRI distribution was negatively skewed, had a median (IQR) of 81.0 (73.8–86.3), and ranged from 2.5 to 98.5, as described in our previous work [<span id="jumplink-CIT0022"></span>22]. Sleep duration had mean (±SD) of 6.77 ± 1.00 hours, and ranged from 0.48 to 13.49 hours. The mean (±SD) follow-up period between accelerometer recording and study endpoint (March 21, 2021) was 6.30 ± 0.83 years. All-cause mortality rate was 4.84 deaths per 1000 person-years, with 1859 all-cause deaths, 377 by cardiometabolic causes, and 1092 by cancer. Mean (±SD) time to mortality was 5.96 ± 1.32 years. Participants in the final sample of 60 997 were 62.8 ± 7.8 years of age, 55.0% female, 97.2% white ethnicity, 60.8% employed, 7.3% shift workers, and had median income range £31000–51 999, Townsend deprivation index score of −1.79 ± 2.77, ≥1 weekly social activities in 72.9%, social visits most commonly experienced weekly (36.2%), 83.6% from an urban postcode, 36.4% previous and 6.3% current smokers, and mean (±SD) physical activity of 28.4 ± 8.1 milli-g across weekly recordings.

<p>Across &gt; 10 million hours of actigraphy data in 60 977 UK Biobank participants, we found that more regular sleep was a significant predictor of lower risk of all-cause mortality. Participants in the top four quintiles (SRI 71.6–98.5) had a 20%–48% lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to those with SRI scores in the bottom quintile (SRI &lt; 71.6). Notably, sleep regularity was a stronger predictor of all-cause mortality than sleep duration. We assessed this by comparison of equivalent SRI-only and duration-only models, and by comparison of nested SRI-duration models. These results were robust to adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, physical activity, smoking status, shift work status, sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, and additional adjustments for mid-sleep timing, preexisting cancer, diabetes, vascular events, high BMI, high cholesterol ratio, and baseline mental health.</p><p>We developed the SRI metric specifically to assess circadian disruption by measuring changes that occur to sleep patterns on a circadian timescale [<span id="jumplink-CIT0024"></span>24]. The SRI captures irregularity due to a combination of fragmented sleep, variable onset, offset, duration, and daytime napping [<span id="jumplink-CIT0030"></span>30]. In this respect, it is distinguished from other markers of intraindividual variability in sleep, which tend to assess only one dimension (e.g. variability in sleep onset timing), make assumptions about sleep patterns (e.g. only one sleep episode per day, as in the “composite phase deviation” metric), and assess intraindividual variability across the entire study period, rather than on a day-to-day basis (e.g. “inter-daily stability”) [<span id="jumplink-CIT0030"></span>30]. Consequently, the SRI is likely to be both a sensitive measure of circadian disruption, contributing to poor long-term health outcomes, and a potential marker of the future development of poor health outcomes via the effects of irregularity on sleep.</p><p>Recent research has shown that the SRI is predictive of a wide range of health outcomes [<span id="jumplink-CIT0012 CIT0013 CIT0014 CIT0015 CIT0016 CIT0017 CIT0018 CIT0019"></span>12–19]. Our study establishes a relationship between SRI and mortality risk using objective data from accelerometers. This result aligns with previous accelerometer studies in smaller samples that have linked variability in specific dimensions of sleep with higher mortality risk, including sleep duration [<span id="jumplink-CIT0031"></span>31], and sleep fragmentation and awakenings [<span id="jumplink-CIT0032"></span>32, <span id="jumplink-CIT0033"></span>33]. Our results also align with the previous finding that lower relative amplitude, a measure of the robustness of rest-activity rhythms, is associated with higher mortality risk [<span id="jumplink-CIT0034"></span>34, <span id="jumplink-CIT0035"></span>35]. Furthermore, self-report studies have linked higher mortality risk with irregular sleep patterns [<span id="jumplink-CIT0021"></span>21], daytime napping [<span id="jumplink-CIT0036"></span>36, <span id="jumplink-CIT0037"></span>37], and longitudinal variability in sleep duration [<span id="jumplink-CIT0006"></span>6]. Our results show definitively in a large prospective sample that irregular sleep is predictive of greater risk of mortality.</p><p>Many studies have linked both short sleep duration and long sleep duration with mortality risk [<span id="jumplink-CIT0001 CIT0002 CIT0003 CIT0004 CIT0005 CIT0006 CIT0007 CIT0008 CIT0009"></span>1–9]. Our results for short sleepers are consistent with this literature. We note that, in our analysis, the longest sleeping group corresponded to a sleep duration of &gt; 7.56 hours, whereas previous studies showing an association of mortality with long sleep have tended to use more extreme cutoffs (e.g. &gt;9 hours or the highest possible response self-report category). We therefore would not necessarily expect to see a heightened risk of mortality in this upper quintile.</p><p>Our study advances previous literature by directly comparing sleep duration and sleep regularity as predictors of mortality risk. Our findings demonstrate that sleep regularity is generally a stronger predictor of mortality risk than sleep duration. These findings align with other studies showing sleep regularity to be a stronger predictor than sleep duration of other health outcomes [<span id="jumplink-CIT0012"></span>12, <span id="jumplink-CIT0013"></span>13]. We propose that these findings emerge because sleep regularity is a more direct proxy for circadian disruption, which is known from experimental studies to have very broad adverse effects on physiology [<span id="jumplink-CIT0038"></span>38]. In animal studies, circadian disruption induced by light patterns that contribute to irregular sleep–wake behavior is known to cause premature mortality [<span id="jumplink-CIT0039"></span>39] and purposeful disruption of the circadian clock with light causes profound cardiovascular disease [<span id="jumplink-CIT0040"></span>40]. Prospective studies of people with irregular sleep have demonstrated links with cardiometabolic health [<span id="jumplink-CIT0012"></span>12, <span id="jumplink-CIT0014 CIT0015 CIT0016 CIT0017"></span>14–17]. We note that while sleep regularity is a more direct measure of circadian disruption, sleep duration may in part also be capturing aspects of circadian disruption. Short and long sleep duration may influence the timing of light exposure, nutritional intake, and physical activity, which impact both central and peripheral circadian rhythms.</p><p>Higher risk of mortality by cardiometabolic causes was associated with both irregular sleep and short sleep duration in our study. These findings are consistent with experimental and epidemiological evidence linking sleep regularity and duration with cardiometabolic health [<span id="jumplink-CIT0004"></span>4, <span id="jumplink-CIT0008"></span>8, <span id="jumplink-CIT0012"></span>12, <span id="jumplink-CIT0021"></span>21, <span id="jumplink-CIT0041 CIT0042 CIT0043 CIT0044 CIT0045 CIT0046"></span>41–46]. Experimental evidence in humans indicates that cardiometabolic risk factors, including arterial blood pressure, inflammatory markers, and insulin sensitivity are altered with reduced sleep duration [<span id="jumplink-CIT0041"></span>41], and under experimental conditions that disrupt circadian rhythms [<span id="jumplink-CIT0042"></span>42]. Epidemiological studies show that the risks of cardiovascular events and mortality are higher in short sleepers [<span id="jumplink-CIT0004"></span>4, <span id="jumplink-CIT0008"></span>8, <span id="jumplink-CIT0043"></span>43, <span id="jumplink-CIT0044"></span>44] across both objective and subjective measures of sleep duration. For sleep regularity, epidemiological studies using actigraphy have linked more variable sleep timing and duration with incident fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease [<span id="jumplink-CIT0045"></span>45] and metabolic abnormalities [<span id="jumplink-CIT0046"></span>46], and SRI-measured sleep regularity with cardiometabolic risk factors [<span id="jumplink-CIT0012"></span>12]. Subjective sleep regularity has also been linked with cardiovascular mortality [<span id="jumplink-CIT0021"></span>21]. While sleep duration and regularity independently predicted cardiometabolic mortality risk in our study, we also found that regularity was not a significant predictor of cardiometabolic mortality in models that also included duration, after adjustment for physical activity, smoking status, shift work status, and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. This result suggests that different aspects of sleep behaviors (duration vs. regularity) may differentially contribute to cardiometabolic mortality risk, possibly due to different effects of homeostatic and circadian disruption on cardiometabolic factors [<span id="jumplink-CIT0041"></span>41, <span id="jumplink-CIT0042"></span>42].</p><p>We found that irregular sleep predicted higher risk of mortality by cancer, whereas short sleep duration did not. Similar to all-cause mortality, this relationship may be ultimately driven by circadian disruption. Several lines of evidence have linked circadian disruption with cancer, including: (1) studies implicating gene expression and metabolic rhythms in cancer initiation and progression [<span id="jumplink-CIT0047"></span>47]; (2) animal studies showing irregular sleep–wake rhythms and circadian disruption cause increased tumor progression and metastasis [<span id="jumplink-CIT0048 CIT0049 CIT0050 CIT0051"></span>48–51] and cancer-induced inflammation [<span id="jumplink-CIT0052"></span>52]; and (3) epidemiological evidence implicating light exposure at night in higher risk of incident breast [<span id="jumplink-CIT0053 CIT0054 CIT0055"></span>53–55], thyroid [<span id="jumplink-CIT0056"></span>56], and pancreatic cancer [<span id="jumplink-CIT0057"></span>57], and shift work exposure in breast [<span id="jumplink-CIT0058"></span>58], prostate [<span id="jumplink-CIT0059"></span>59], lung, and skin cancer [<span id="jumplink-CIT0060"></span>60]. In contrast, epidemiological evidence indicates that sleep duration is only linked with higher cancer mortality risk in a small substrata of long sleepers (&gt;9 hours), but not in short sleepers [<span id="jumplink-CIT0001"></span>1, <span id="jumplink-CIT0043"></span>43, <span id="jumplink-CIT0061"></span>61], which is consistent with our findings for short sleepers. Notably, the relationship we found between irregular sleep and higher cancer mortality risk remained robust in individuals without a preexisting cancer diagnosis, further supporting the hypothesis that irregular sleep and circadian disruption influence cancer initiation, progression, and eventual mortality.</p><p>There are several limitations in this study. First, the single week of data collected for each individual provides only a snapshot of their sleep–wake patterns, and future work should collect sleep–wake data over a longer timeframe and include multiple weekend-weekday transitions. It is nevertheless interesting that even a snapshot of sleep behaviors is predictive of mortality for a follow-up period of several years. Second, accelerometer recordings did not occur simultaneously with collection of baseline covariates, and some of these covariates may not remain temporally stable within each individual. Third, our findings are within an older age group of mostly homogeneous ethnicity, and should be replicated across other cohorts, including cross-culturally. Fourth, our fully adjusted models contain variables that potentially have both confounding and mediating effects (e.g. smoking status). The true strength of the sleep regularity-mortality relationship therefore likely lies between our minimally adjusted models, which contain only non-mediating covariates, and our fully adjusted models. Finally, we acknowledge the correlational nature of our findings. Sleep regularity may be both a cause and marker of premature mortality risk.</p><p>One key determinant of a high SRI score is regular timing of sleep onset and offset. In our study, people with the top 20% of SRI scores went to sleep and awoke within approximately 1-hour windows on the majority of their study days. By contrast, people with the bottom 20% of SRI scores went to sleep and awoke within approximately 3-hour windows. Aiming to fall asleep and wake up within 1-hour windows each day may therefore be a feasible strategy for improving SRI, especially for individuals who keep only one main sleep episode per day. We note that awakenings during the night and fragmented sleep patterns also contribute to low SRI scores, and should therefore also be taken into consideration.</p><p>In summary, our findings challenge the long-standing assumption that sleep duration is the most important index of sleep for human health. The preponderance of research on sleep and health has focused on sleep duration as the primary predictor. The resultant frameworks for public health have consequently tended to focus on sleep duration as the key target. Our results confirm an important role for sleep duration in predicting mortality, but reveal that sleep regularity is an even stronger predictor. Fortunately, sleep regularity may also be an easier dimension to target through interventions. Due to both psychosocial and biological reasons, extending sleep duration can be challenging to achieve in practice. Interventions to extend sleep that do not directly schedule when participants can sleep have only small effects on sleep duration [<span id="jumplink-CIT0062"></span>62]. Asking people to maintain more similar sleep times between days to improve sleep regularity, rather than devoting a greater proportion of the day to sleep, may ultimately be a more feasible strategy.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="435231475" id="435231475" data-legacy-id="a1">Acknowledgments</h2>

    </div><p>Researchers at The University of Texas at El Paso have created a portable device that can detect colorectal and prostate cancer more cheaply and quickly than prevailing methods. The team believes the device may be especially helpful in developing countries, which experience higher cancer mortality rates due in part to barriers to medical diagnosis.</p>

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    <p>"Our new biochip device is low-cost—just a few dollars—and sensitive, which will make accurate disease diagnosis accessible to anyone, whether rich or poor," said XiuJun (James) Li, Ph.D., a UTEP professor of chemistry and biochemistry. "It is portable, rapid and eliminates the need for specialized instruments."</p>
<p>Li is the lead author on a new study describing the device, <a href="https://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=D4LC00485J" target="_blank">published</a> in <i>Lab on a Chip</i>, a journal that focuses on micro-scale and <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nanoscale+devices/" rel="tag">nanoscale devices</a>.</p>
<p>Li explained that the most commonly used commercial method of cancer biomarker detection, known as ELISA, requires costly instrumentation to work correctly and can take twelve hours or longer to process a sample. This delay is heightened in <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/rural+areas/" rel="tag">rural areas</a> in the U.S. or developing countries, he said, because patient samples must be transported to larger cities with specialized instruments, contributing to a higher rate of cancer mortality.</p>
<p>"If you can detect biomarkers early on, before the cancer spreads, you increase a patients' chance of survival," Li said. "Any delays in testing, especially in regions that don't have access to expensive tools and instruments, can be very bad for a patient's prognosis."</p>

<p>The device that Li's team created is microfluidic, which means that it can perform multiple functions using very small amounts of fluids. The device uses an innovative "paper-in-polymer-pond" structure, in which patient blood samples are introduced into tiny wells and onto a special kind of paper. The paper captures cancer protein biomarkers within the blood samples in just a few minutes. The paper subsequently changes color, and the intensity of the color indicates what type of cancer is detected and how far it has progressed.</p>

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>So far, the research has focused on prostate and <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/colorectal+cancers/" rel="tag">colorectal cancers</a>, but Li said the method they devised could be applicable to a wide variety of cancer types.</p>
<p>Li said that the device can analyze a sample in an hour—compared to 16 hours using some traditional methods. According to study results, the device is also about 10 times more sensitive than traditional methods, even without using specialized instruments. That means the device can detect cancer biomarkers that are present in smaller quantities, typical of cancer in its early stages. A less sensitive device may not pick up on the smaller quantities, Li said.</p>
<p>Before the device is available to the public, Li said the prototype of the device will need to be finalized and the device tested on patients in a clinical trial, which could take several years. It would require final approval by the Food and Drug Administration before it could be used by physicians.</p>
<p>"Dr. XiuJun Li's innovation significantly improves point-of-care diagnostics by reducing detection times and the need for costly instruments," said Robert Kirken, dean of the College of Science. "This makes it ideal for resource-limited settings, which will improve early diagnosis and lead to better cancer outcomes. I look forward to seeing what this innovation leads to."</p>
<p>An additional co-author on the study is Sanjay Timilsina, Ph.D., a former graduate research assistant at UTEP. Li is a member of the <i>Lab on a Chip</i> advisory board.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-645">
  
  <div data-hide-featured-media="0">
<p>Alright, folks, gather around because it’s story time about one of the most underrated yet indispensable tools in the digital world—Notepad++. This month marks the 21st anniversary of this amazing software, and that’s right, Notepad++ is finally legal to drink (if it were a person, of course). Can you believe it? 21 years of keeping developers, writers, and pretty much anyone who’s ever needed to write a chunk of text happy and efficient.</p>



<p><strong>A Little Nostalgia: Where It All Began</strong></p>



<p>Let’s rewind to 2003. It was a simpler time. YouTube didn’t even exist yet, the iPhone was still a distant dream, and social media was nowhere near what it is today. Somewhere in that digital wilderness, a passionate developer named Don Ho (no, not the Hawaiian singer) decided that the existing text editors were just not cutting it. He wanted something more powerful yet lightweight, a tool that respected a user’s CPU and RAM, unlike some bloated software out there. So, he started developing Notepad++, and on November 25th, 2003, the first version saw the light of day.</p>



<p>Fun fact: It’s built on Scintilla, a free source code editing component, and written in C++ for ultimate performance. Even back then, Notepad++ was all about being efficient, just like the developers who use it.</p>



<p><strong>Why We Love It: The Features That Make It Special</strong></p>



<p>So what makes Notepad++ so special that it’s still kicking after 21 years? The magic lies in its simplicity and, ironically, its complexity. It’s simple for those who need a straightforward, no-nonsense text editor, yet it offers complex features for hardcore developers who demand syntax highlighting, multi-document tabbing, and support for dozens of programming languages. It’s a tool that evolves with you.</p>



<p>Remember when auto-save was the most mind-blowing feature? Or how about that moment you discovered you could compare two files side-by-side? Yeah, those were “Whoa!” moments we never forget. And let’s not ignore the thousands of plugins that make your editing experience as smooth as a freshly oiled engine. Need to turn JSON into something readable? Boom, there’s a plugin for that. Want to FTP directly from your editor? Done. Notepad++ has been the Swiss Army knife of text editors, and we’ve all been better for it.</p>



<p><strong>Through the Ups and Downs: The Drama and the Triumphs</strong></p>



<p>Notepad++ has had its fair share of adventures over the years. In fact, it hasn’t shied away from taking a stand on social and political issues. One famous episode occurred in 2019, when Don Ho released a version called “Free Uyghur” to raise awareness about the situation in Xinjiang. This caused quite a stir and even got Notepad++ banned in some regions. It was a bold move, but it showed that this wasn’t just a piece of software; it was a platform for advocacy.</p>



<p>And let’s not forget about the challenges of keeping Notepad++ relevant in an era dominated by fancy IDEs like Visual Studio Code. Yet, even as tech trends come and go, Notepad++ continues to be beloved. It’s like the vinyl records of text editors—no matter how modern things get, there’s always something timeless about it.</p>



<p><strong>The Secret Sauce: Community Love and Open-Source Spirit</strong></p>



<p>What really makes Notepad++ extraordinary is its community. Being open-source means that countless developers have contributed to making it better, more secure, and more functional. This little editor that could has stayed alive and thriving for two decades, not because of a massive corporation backing it, but because of people like us who believed in its purpose.</p>



<p>Over the years, Notepad++ has received numerous awards, and rightfully so. From SourceForge Community Choice Awards to Lifehacker’s reader favorites, it’s a decorated veteran of the software world. But, you know, it’s not really about the awards. It’s about how many hours of work it has saved us. The late-night coding sessions where syntax highlighting kept our eyes from bleeding, or the way it smoothly handles massive files when other editors throw up their hands and crash.</p>



<p><strong>Looking to the Future: What’s Next for Notepad++?</strong></p>



<p>As Notepad++ steps into its 21st year, the future looks bright. Sure, there will be more trends, more changes in how we write and manage code, but Notepad++ will always have a place. Whether you’re a seasoned developer, a writer needing a distraction-free space, or just someone editing a config file, it’s there for you.</p>



<p>Who knows? Maybe one day it’ll have AI features, or perhaps it’ll integrate seamlessly with the tech of the future. But even if it doesn’t, we know it’ll always remain true to its roots: a fast, efficient, no-BS editor for everyone.</p>



<p>So here’s to you, Notepad++. Thanks for 21 incredible years. We can’t wait to see what you’ll do next!</p>

I’ve been struck by how many parallels there are between modern China (roughly the period from the late 1970s till today) and the Gilded Age/Progressive era U.S. (roughly the period from the late 1860s to the 1920s).</p><p>During these periods, unprecedented levels of economic growth combined with large populations were making both the U.S. and China wealthy and powerful. Both countries were urbanizing, building enormous amounts of infrastructure, and becoming by far the largest manufacturers in the world, with industrial operations of unprecedented size. Both were undergoing wrenching social and cultural change as old institutions were replaced by new ones, and the countries began to become “modern.” Both were nations of ambitious strivers, where it seemed like anyone with talent could make themselves into a success by catching the tide of rising opportunity. Despite the many differences between the two countries, the forces of development pulled them along very similar paths.</p><p>In the decades following the Civil War and the Cultural Revolution, respectively, the U.S. and China both saw record-setting economic growth. In 1820 the US had a GDP roughly 1/3rd the size of the United Kingdom’s or France’s, and roughly half of Germany’s or Italy’s. By 1870, its GDP was nearly as large as the UK’s, and was about 40% larger than France or Germany’s. By 1913, its GDP was more than twice as large as either the UK’s or Germany’s.</p><p><span>In the 1870s, the US grew somewhere between 4.5 and 6.7 percent annually in real terms, one of the fastest growth rates ever recorded. From 1870 to 1913, the US maintained a growth rate of nearly 4%; no European country had a growth rate more than 3% over the same period. In his </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tycoons-Carnegie-Rockefeller-Invented-Supereconomy/dp/0805081348" rel="">book</a><span> on tycoons of the Gilded Age, Charles Morris states that “the sustained American growth spurt was the fastest in history, at least until the Pacific Rim countries made their run for daylight a century later.”</span></p><p><span>China, of course, has redefined what it means to be “rapidly growing.” It went from having the 6th-largest GDP in </span><a href="https://countryeconomy.com/gdp?year=1980" rel="">1980</a><span> (slightly larger than Canada’s) to the second largest GDP in </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/16/business/global/16yuan.html" rel="">2010</a><span>. While </span><a href="https://countryeconomy.com/gdp?year=2023" rel="">today</a><span> China is still behind the US in GDP (without adjusting for purchasing power, at least), it’s nearly four times the size of the third largest country, Germany. Between 1980 and 2020, China’s GDP grew nearly 10% annually in real terms.</span></p><p><span>Both the U.S. and China were able to become such large economies in part because of their comparatively large populations. China was already by far the largest country by population in </span><a href="https://www.populationpyramid.net/population-size-per-country/1980/" rel="">1980</a><span> with nearly 1 billion people, and today it has over 1.4 billion (though it's been eclipsed in population by </span><a href="https://www.populationpyramid.net/population-size-per-country/2023/" rel="">India</a><span>.) The U.S. grew from a relatively small population in 1820 (half the UK’s and 1/3rd that of France) to having by far the largest population of any industrialized country.</span></p><p><span>The U.S.’s population surge was in part the result of immigration. Between 1880 and 1920, the number of foreign-born residents in the US </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2760060/" rel="">doubled</a><span>, from 7 million to 14 million, and by 1920 roughly 1/3rd of the U.S.’s population was either first or second generation immigrants. In some cities in the early 20th century, immigrants and their children </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2760060/" rel="">made up</a><span> as much as 3/4ths of the population.</span></p><p><span>China hasn’t had the same influx of immigrants (its foreign-born population remains small, less than </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_China" rel="">1.5 million</a><span>, or around 0.1% of the population), but it saw its own wave of migration in the form of huge masses of workers migrating from rural areas to cities. Over three decades, 130 million migrants had moved into cities, the largest migration in human history. Because China’s </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou" rel="">hukou</a><span> residency system (which classifies someone as a resident of a particular place, and an urban or rural resident) places limits on worker movement, migration in China in some ways resembled foreign immigration. Migration was often done illicitly, and migrants often faced discrimination and poor working conditions.</span></p><p><span>In both countries, this mass movement of people was paralleled by a rapid growth of cities and an increase in urbanization. In 1860, the US was still mostly a rural country, with an urbanization rate of around 20%. By 1920, urbanization had </span><a href="https://lboustan.scholar.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf4146/files/lboustan/files/research21_urban_handbook.pdf" rel="">passed 50%</a><span>, reaching 75% in the more industrialized Northeast. The U.S. didn’t have a single city larger than 1 million people in 1860, and the population of the 10 largest cities combined was only around 2.7 million. By 1920, there were three (nearly four) U.S. cities with a population of 1 million or more, and the population of the 10 largest cities was more than 15 million. China likewise went from an urbanization rate of less than 20% in 1980 to more than 60% in 2020, as millions of people poured into its cities. Shenzhen had a population of around 30,000 in 1980; by 2020, it had a population of more than </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen" rel="">17 million</a><span>, and was the third largest city in China.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae64b6eb-14e6-4b34-ab11-c060c55bb80f_865x430.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae64b6eb-14e6-4b34-ab11-c060c55bb80f_865x430.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae64b6eb-14e6-4b34-ab11-c060c55bb80f_865x430.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae64b6eb-14e6-4b34-ab11-c060c55bb80f_865x430.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae64b6eb-14e6-4b34-ab11-c060c55bb80f_865x430.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae64b6eb-14e6-4b34-ab11-c060c55bb80f_865x430.png" width="865" height="430" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ae64b6eb-14e6-4b34-ab11-c060c55bb80f_865x430.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:430,&quot;width&quot;:865,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae64b6eb-14e6-4b34-ab11-c060c55bb80f_865x430.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae64b6eb-14e6-4b34-ab11-c060c55bb80f_865x430.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae64b6eb-14e6-4b34-ab11-c060c55bb80f_865x430.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae64b6eb-14e6-4b34-ab11-c060c55bb80f_865x430.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Shenzhen in 1985 vs Shenzhen in 2015.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>China’s rapid urbanization is reflected in a constant stream of impressive feats of infrastructure construction.

Hardly three decades before, America was still torn and bleeding from a savage civil war, making its living exporting raw cotton, grain, and timber in exchange for Europe’s surplus manufactures.”</p><p><span>While today you can’t throw a rock without hitting a book about the rise of China, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries there were hundreds of books written discussing America’s economic success. A 1902 British book, </span><em>The American Invaders</em><span>, chronicled how American manufactured goods were transforming lives “from Madrid to St. Petersburg”:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“The average citizen wakes in the morning at the sound of an American [alarm] clock; rises from his New England sheets, and shaves with his New York soap, and a Yankee safety razor. He pulls on a pair of Boston boots over his socks from West Carolina, fastens his Connecticut braces, slips his Waterbury watch into his pocket and sits down to breakfast. Then he congratulates his wife on the way her Illinois straight-front corset sets off her Massachusetts blouse, and begins his breakfast at which he eats bread made from prairie flour... tinned oysters from Baltimore, and a little Kansas City bacon... The children are given Quaker Oats. Concurrently he reads his morning paper, set up by American machines, printed with American ink, by American presses, on American paper... Rising from his breakfast table the citizen rushes out, catches an electric tram [made] in New York to Shepherd’s Bush, where he gets into a Yankee elevator, which takes him on to the American-fitted railway to the city. At his office of course everything is American. He sits at a Nebraskan swivel chair, before a Michigan roll-top desk, writes his letters on a Syracuse typewriter, signing them with a New York fountain pen, and drying them with a blotting sheet from New England. The letter copies are put away in files manufactured in Grand Rapids. When evening comes he seeks relaxation at the latest Adelphi melodrama or Drury Lane startler, both made in America... For relief he drinks a cocktail or some California wine and finishes up with a couple of ‘little liver pills’ made in America…”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>The manufactured goods that America did produce were often considered low quality: Morris notes that up to the Civil War, most American tools and guns were made of British steel parts, and that for railroads, “any carrier looking for quality rails and rolling stock did its shopping in England.” But by the early 20th century, American goods seemed to be conquering the world, even complex, high-end goods like locomotives and </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c1576/c1576.pdf" rel="">machine tools</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>China seems to have matched this trajectory beat for beat.

And while historically Chinese goods were considered </span><a href="https://www.qualitydigest.com/inside/management-article/made-china-scary-bad-scary-good-052918.html" rel="">low quality</a><span>, today they lead the field in things like 3D printers and drones, and are closing in even on exceptionally complex products like </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/will-the-china-cycle-come-for-airbus" rel="">jet aircraft</a><span>.</span></p><p>In both the U.S. and China, the transition to manufacturing powerhouse came through operating at previously unimaginable levels of scale. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the development of transportation and communication infrastructure like railroads, steamships, and telegraphs made it possible to cost effectively transport goods long distances, creating large markets and enabling the creation of enormous industrial facilities far larger than anything that had been seen before.&nbsp;</p><p><span>The U.S. developed a host of mass-production and continuous-process manufacturing methods that could produce a constant stream of output in enormous quantities, a transformation sometimes known as the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution" rel="">second industrial revolution</a><span>. Alfred Chandler notes in “</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visible-Hand-Managerial-Revolution-American/dp/0674940520" rel="">The Visible Hand</a><span>” that continuous or near-continuous process machinery transformed the production of things like tobacco, canned food, soap, petroleum, liquor, steel, glass, cigarettes, matches, and bottles. The Bonsack cigarette machine, invented in 1881, could automatically perform every operation of cigarette making, and just 30 such machines were needed to produce enough cigarettes for the entire U.S. In the 1870s, the Diamond Match company developed machines that could make matches by the billions; around this same time, </span><a href="https://www.brogan-patrick.com/blog/the-history-of-automatic-screw-machines/" rel="">automatic screw cutting lathes</a><span> were developed to produce huge quantities of metal screws. In the case of oats, new continuous mills generated so much output that manufacturers were forced to invent a new product — breakfast cereal — to make use of it all. In the early 20th century, Ford’s assembly line revolutionized car manufacturing, and similar mass production methods (often under the name “Fordism”) were adopted by other industries for complex manufactured goods.</span></p><p><span>Modern China has also pushed the scale envelope in its manufacturing operations. The peak of scale in American manufacturing operations is arguably Ford’s </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_River_Rouge_complex" rel="">Rouge complex</a><span>, which has operations spread over nearly 1,000 acres and at its height employed around 75,000 workers.

The pinnacle of American manufacturing scale, achieved only briefly, seems like table stakes for Chinese manufacturing.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Notably, both the US and China lagged scientifically even as they were becoming powerful economically. In “</span><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/about/history/vbush1945.htm" rel="">Science, The Endless Frontier</a><span>," the famous 1945 report advocating for robust government support for basic research, Vannevar Bush notes that in the 19th century, American industrial progress often involved “Yankee ingenuity” building upon the scientific discoveries of Europeans. While Edison may have invented the electric light, he built upon scientific discoveries of the nature of electricity that were largely European. Between 1901 and 1921, the U.S. accumulated just three Nobel prizes in science, compared to 9 each in France and the UK and 20 in Germany.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>China, similarly, has not necessarily been a leader in scientific progress, even as it has become an economic juggernaut. China has won </span><a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2015/tu/facts/" rel="">just one</a><span> Nobel Prize in science, and doesn’t seem to have done much better with other scientific prizes.

Partly these changes were simply the result of adopting what we now consider modern conveniences. In </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-American-Growth-Princeton/dp/0691147728" rel="">The Rise and Fall of American Growth</a></em><span>, Robert Gordon notes how U.S. home life was transformed between 1870 and 1940:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“Instead of relying on candles and kerosene carried into the home, each home was connected to the electricity network that provided electric light and an ever growing variety of electric home appliances. Instead of relying on privies and outhouses and cesspools, each home was gradually connected to two more networks, one bringing in a supply of clean running water and the other taking waste out into sewers. Houses of the rich after 1880 and of the working class after 1910 were increasingly supplied with central heating… Another network, that of telephones, also grew rapidly after 1890.</em></p><p><em>…By 1940 in urban America, electricity was universal, the percentage of homes with washing machines and electric refrigerators had reached 40 percent, and telephone connections, running water, private bathrooms with modern plumbing fixtures, and central heating had become commonplace.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>A similar transformation took place in China. Access to basic sanitation in China rose from 24% in </span><a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2020/03/10/access-to-sanitation-services-improves-the-quality-of-life-in-rural-china#:~:text=China%20has%20made%20significant%20progress,from%2024%25%20to%2065%25." rel="">1990</a><span> to 84% in </span><a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2019-11-18/How-the-Toilet-Revolution-is-changing-China-LH2SCXCemQ/index.html" rel="">2017</a><span>, and since 1980 </span><a href="https://www.reseau-cicle.org/wp-content/uploads/riaed/pdf/Rural_Electrification_China_Peng.pdf" rel="">hundreds of millions</a><span> of Chinese have gained access to electricity. In 1980, China had just over </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/39050/chapter-abstract/338338496?redirectedFrom=fulltext" rel="">4 million telephones</a><span> in the entire country, and as late as 1996 there were just 5 phones per 100 people; today, mobile phone adoption in China is </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mobile-cellular-subscriptions-per-100-people?tab=chart&amp;country=~CHN" rel="">universal</a><span>. Cars per 1,000 people rose from </span><a href="https://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1443&amp;context=etds" rel="">1.8</a><span> in 1980 to around </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_territories_by_motor_vehicles_per_capita" rel="">231</a><span> today, an increase of more than 100x. TV, internet, and air conditioning have likewise become commonplace if not ubiquitous.</span></p><p>This transformation spawned highly consumerist cultures in both countries as a large middle class emerged. Charles Morris describes the late 19th century U.S. as the first “mass consumer” society, with Americans purchasing a wide variety of new products, sold at new chain stores like A&amp;P and Woolworths, or through catalogs like Sears and Montgomery Ward. Morris notes:</p><blockquote><p><em>“History had never seen an explosion of new products like that in the America of the 1880s and 1890s. Branded foods followed the lead of the meatpackers, starting in the 1880s. Store shelves offered Cream of Wheat, Aunt Jemima’s Pancakes, Postum, Kellogg's Shredded Wheat, Juicy Fruit gum, Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, Durkee’s salad dressings, Uneeda Biscuits, Coca-Cola, and Quaker Oats. Pillsbury and Gold Medal wiped out local flour millers.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>One </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_Givers" rel="">1925 novel</a><span> on immigrant life described how acquiring newly available goods inevitably resulted in a desire for more of them. An immigrant family replaces their rags with real towels, then gets dishes and tableware “so we could all sit down at the table at the same time and eat like people," and continues to want more and more:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“We no sooner got used to regular towels than we began to want toothbrushes… We got the toothbrushes and we began wanting tooth powder to brush our teeth with, instead of ashes. And the more and more we wanted more things, and really needed more things, the more we got them.”&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p><span>China seems to have gone through a similar evolution; the rise of a Chinese middle class created what has been called “tidal wave consumption” as shoppers began to quickly purchase the products they saw their neighbors buy. A man born to a professional family in China in the 1970s </span><a href="https://x.com/CarlZha/status/1851068527178088462" rel="">noted that</a><span> in the 1980s, “We only had meat 2-3 times a week, needed ration coupons to purchase rice, cooking oil, sugar, fabric etc.” By 2012, China had become the </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/08/business/china-bans-luxury-product-ads/index.html?hpt=hp_bn5" rel="">largest market</a><span> for luxury goods, and by 2014 China had just under 20% of the world’s population but roughly </span><a href="https://scholarworks.brandeis.edu/esploro/outputs/graduate/China-A-Nation-Shaped-in-Consumerism/9923879980001921" rel="">60% of its shopping mall space</a><span>. Around the same time, an influx of Chinese money made Macau the largest gambling city in the world: six times more money flowed through Macau than Las Vegas. In his 2017 essay “</span><a href="https://scholars-stage.org/everything-is-worse-in-china/" rel="">Everything is Worse in China</a><span>," Tanner Greer describes China as subject to “crass materialism," and “wealth chased, gained, and wasted for nothing more than vain display” at levels far worse than the modern U.S. In his 2014 </span><em>Age of Ambition</em><span>, Evan Osnos describes consumerism in China becoming commonplace:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“Shopping, or at least browsing, became a principal hobby. The average Chinese citizen was dedicating almost ten hours a week to shopping, while the average American spent less than four. That was partly because the process was less efficient in China — public transportation, cost comparisons — and partly because it was a novel form of entertainment. A study of advertising found that the average person in Shanghai saw three times as many advertisements in a typical day as a consumer in London. The market was flooded with new brands seeking to distinguish themselves, and Chinese consumers were relatively comfortable with bold efforts to get their attention. Ads were so abundant that fashion magazines ran up against physical constraints: editors of the Chinese edition of </em><span>Cosmopolitan</span><em> once had to split an issue into two volumes because a single magazine was too thick to handle.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>At the high-end of the income distribution, both the U.S. and China saw the emergence of a new, ultra wealthy class. Osnos notes that “In 1850, America had fewer than twenty millionaires; by 1900 it had forty thousand”; China likewise has seen a rapid increase in the number of </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-number-of-billionaires-in-China-1999-2018-Source-Graphs-by-author-based-on-data_fig1_338852605" rel="">billionaires</a><span> from virtually none before 2000 to hundreds today. By 2014, China was “the world’s fastest growing source of new billionaires.”</span></p><p><span>The sense I get from each time and place is of a roiling, bubbling ferment, as the old structures and ways of life are ripped apart and replaced by modern ones. In China, an economy driven entirely by state-owned companies and top-down planning was transforming into a market-driven one, requiring people to learn new rules, new strategies, and an entirely new way of life. In her book about Chinese female migrants, </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Factory-Girls-Village-Changing-China/dp/0385520182" rel="">Factory Girls</a></em><span>, Leslie Chang describes parents of migrant workers completely unequipped to give advice for the new world that was being created.</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“The parents of migrants had terrible instincts. At every stage, they gave bad advice; they specialized in outdated knowledge and conservatism born out of fear… on the job front, their advice was invariably bad.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Osnos notes that in Beijing, “The endless churn was the only constant," and that he “never passed up an invitation, because places, and people, vanished before you had the chance to see them again.” Other places seemed static and unchanging by comparison: a Chinese friend of Osnos rejected a suggestion to visit New York on a trip to America because “everytime I go, it looks the same.”</p><p>Likewise, in the U.S. old institutions were ripped apart and replaced by new ones. While historically America had been a rural nation of small farmers and small businesses, by the late 19th century it was “careening towards modernity," being taken over by huge corporations and impersonal institutions. Morris describes how the “old ways of life, long settled expectations, all the fixed stars for measuring stature and progress, were violently wrenched out of place.”</p><blockquote><p><em>“The Whig vision of a frictionless, monadlike society of independent artisans and farmers was being swallowed up by its own relentless logic of development. The infrastructure of modernity — fast, cheap transportation; ready access to primary materials like coal, iron, and oil; real-time communications; smoothly flowing channels of finance capital — demanded behemoth-scale institutions, sprawling, soulless, autistically focused on pouring out more steel, more coal, more stocks and bonds, more of whatever they happened to do. During the 1870s, the wrenching forces of modernization achieved maximum torque on the old ways of living and governing and doing business. The captains of modernity, the Carnegies, the Rockefellers, the Goulds, and their admirers; all the people yearning to strike out on new salients, buy more things, behave in new ways; immigrants seeking release from the encrusted semifeudal strictures of Old Europe: they all reveled in the change. Probably half the country hated it.”&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>In both countries, this upheaval created huge amounts of opportunity. With the old structures of life falling away, and new ones taking shape, there was much to gain by those willing to take risks, regardless of whether you had the right background or traditional status markets. In both countries new businesses would constantly spring up, fail, and then get replaced by different businesses, and people would quickly move from one opportunity to another. Both nations seemed full of strivers, people who would scramble and scrape to get ahead, and were rewarded for doing so.</p><p><span>In the U.S., many tycoons and industrialists worked their way up from modest beginnings. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller" rel="">John D. Rockefeller</a><span> was the son of a con artist who abandoned his family, and Rockefeller’s first job was as an assistant bookkeeper. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie" rel="">Andrew Carnegie</a><span> was a Scottish immigrant and son of a weaver, born in a one-room house. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_M._Schwab" rel="">Charles Schwab</a><span>, one of Carnegie’s lieutenants and later a major steel executive in his own right, started his steel career earning a dollar a day driving stakes when he was 17. Within 6 months he was managing construction for a large blast furnace. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Westinghouse" rel="">George Westinghouse</a><span> was the son of a farmer and machine shop owner, and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford" rel="">Henry Ford</a><span> was also the son of a farmer. And while not everyone could become a tycoon, less stratospheric opportunities still abounded. Morris describes a man, Edward Tailer, who “left school to clerk for a New York dry goods importer, but complained about the pay, only $50 a year. By the time he was twenty-one, he was making $450 a year; he jumped to another firm the next year for $1,000, then became a traveling salesman at $1,200, and had his own business when he was twenty-five.” Such stories were far from rare:&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“…Few places have ever been as open to people of talent as post-Civil War America; and in America, no field offered opportunities as unlimited as business. America’s radically different manufacturing culture, its cult of the innovative entrepreneur, its obsession with “getting ahead” even on the part of ordinary people, its enthusiasm for the new — the new tool, the new consumer product — were all unique.”&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Most surprising of all to me was how much of what seems like a quintessentially American culture seems to have been recapitulated in modern China. In </span><em>Factory Girls</em><span>, migrants constantly move from one factory to another for new job opportunities, and many work their way up from assembly line workers to managers of entire factories (people changed jobs so often that mobile numbers were the only reliable way to reach them — office or dorm numbers were quickly out of date). Chang notes that migrants’ “tolerance for risk was astonishing. If they didn’t like a boss or a coworker, they jumped somewhere else and never looked back.” Evan Osnos likewise notes in his aptly titled </span><em>Age of Ambition</em><span> that “I had come to expect that Chinese friends would make financial decisions that I found uncomfortably risky: launching businesses with their savings, moving across the country without the assurance of a job.” Ambition, which had traditionally been cautioned against, became something to be celebrated:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“The change that startled me most surrounded the word for ‘ambition,’ ye xin — literally, ‘wild heart.’ In Chinese, a wild heart had always carried the suggestion of savage abandon and absurd expectations — a toad who dreams of devouring a swan, as an old saying had it… But suddenly I was seeing references to ‘wild hearts’ everywhere — on television talk shows and in the self-help aisles. Bookstores carried titles such as ‘Great Wild Hearts: the Ups and Downs of Pioneering Entrepreneurial Heroes’ and ‘How to Have a Wild Heart in Your Twenties.’”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>(As I understand it, this ferment in China has died down somewhat since the early 2010s, and the Chinese economy no longer has such a “frontier” aspect to it. In </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Other-Rivers-Education-Peter-Hessler/dp/0593655338" rel="">Other Rivers</a></em><span>, for instance, Peter Hessler notes that it's no longer common for middle-aged people to abandon careers to start new businesses.)</span></p><p><span>Paired with this celebration of ambition is a culture of individualism and self-reliance. Osnos reports that “The state media, which had once encouraged everyone to be a ‘rustless screw’ in the machine, now acknowledged the new reality of competition: ‘you must rely on yourself,’ the </span><em>Hebei Economic Daily</em><span> wrote. ‘Blaze your own path and fight.’” Osnos writes:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“Companies reinforced that message. China Mobile sold cell phone service aimed at people under twenty-five, using the slogan ‘My Turf, My Decision.’ Even in rural areas, where things changed slowly, people spoke of themselves in different ways. Mette Halskov Hansen, a Norwegian sinologist who spent four years in a countryside school, found that teachers were trying to prepare their students for a world in which survival required ‘self-reliance, self-promotion, and the self-made individual.’”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>An obsession with self-reliance also peppers Leslie Chang’s </span><em>Factory Girls</em><span>: a constant refrain, repeated by migrant girls themselves and in the magazines and media that cater to them, is that “you can only rely on yourself” (not surprising since workers are far from home, with few social ties, and constantly changing factories.) Migrants are constantly taking classes to try to improve themselves and their career prospects: often in English and computers, but also things like injection molding machine operation and how to work in an office.</span></p><p><span>With institutions constantly in flux and being reshaped, and with culture and social mores untethered, these worlds of immense opportunity also contain an immense number of scams, schemes, and grift. Morris describes the late 1860s U.S. as a “pandemic of corruption” triggered by the huge injection of federal spending, and </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-history-dept/2015/02/12/385310877/how-scams-worked-in-the-1800s" rel="">NPR</a><span> describes the 1800s as “the golden age of schemes.” The builders of the transcontinental railroad, for instance, built a deliberately winding route for the railroad since they were being paid by the mile, and siphoned even more money from the project by billing the government nearly twice what the railroad actually cost to build in what was known as the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A9dit_Mobilier_scandal" rel="">Credit-Mobilier</a><span> scandal. Con man </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_C._Parker#:~:text=Parker%20(disambiguation).-,George%20C.,public%20landmarks%2C%20to%20unwary%20immigrants." rel="">George Parker</a><span> successfully “sold” the Brooklyn Bridge multiple times, as well as other major landmarks like the Statue of Liberty, Grant’s Tomb, and Madison Square garden.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Immature financial markets and securities laws (the Securities and Exchange Commission wasn’t created until </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission" rel="">1934</a><span>) were constantly exploited by men like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Gould" rel="">Jay Gould</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/Daniel-Drew" rel="">Daniel Drew</a><span>, dubbed “robber barons” for their illicit, unscrupulous accumulation of wealth.

Consumers were expected to be sharp in their interactions, and legal doctrine for commerce was based on “caveat emptor” (let the buyer beware): an unrestrained business environment allowing risky and dangerous enterprises was thought to be necessary for the “‘industrial and commercial development…of a new and expanding nation.” In </span><em>Fraud: An American History from Barnum to Madoff, </em><span>Edward Balleisen</span><em><strong> </strong><span>writes:</span></em><span>&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“America’s legal elites tried to balance longstanding norms that upheld truthful commercial speech against their age’s commitment to entrepreneurial activity and rapid economic growth. The latter priorities, encapsulated in the concept of ‘Go-Aheadism,’ counseled leeway for salesmanship and showmanship, respect for the free flow of commercial speech, and reliance on the ability of consumers and investors to look out for their own interests.”</em></p></blockquote><p>China seems to have (or had) both a similar Wild West aspect and an obsession with economic growth. Chang’s factory girls are constantly at risk from being scammed or grifted by opportunists: bus drivers who take their ticket then kick them off, con-men who trick them out of their money, peddlers selling get-rich-quick schemes or dubious training courses, sales organizations which are really pyramid schemes, factory owners who force them to work for less than minimum wage or for more than the legal number of hours. At the same time, they’re constantly skirting the law themselves: using fake IDs to freely move around, lying about their skills and abilities to get hired, and buying counterfeit diplomas. Chang recounts one interaction with the teacher of a training course for migrants:</p><blockquote><p><em>“‘In job interviews,’ I said, ‘the girls are often asked if they have experience. They say yes, but actually they don’t.’</em></p><p><em>I was trying to approach the topic carefully, but Teacher Deng pounced. ‘Yes, and the next question is: “What did you do in your old job?” We teach them the details of the factory so they can answer in a convincing way.’</em></p><p><em>‘But they’re telling lies,’ I said.</em></p><p><em><span>‘Yes.’</span><br><span>‘What if they don’t want to?’</span></em></p><p><em>‘It’s up to them,’ teacher Deng said. ‘But people who are too honest in this society will lose out.’”&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p><span>This Wild West culture has costs beyond the financial: an </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Sichuan_earthquake" rel="">earthquake</a><span> in Sichuan, China in 2008 was especially devastating in part because of corners cut during building construction: some buildings were found to be reinforced with bamboo rather than steel. Similarly, the Great Chicago Fire in 1871 was so devastating in part because of the lack of building codes and unrestricted construction of lightweight wood buildings.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Both countries ultimately made efforts to rein in harms from corruption and unchecked development. In the U.S., the Gilded Age was followed by the Progressive Era, where reformers advocated for </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-much-safer-has-construction-gotten" rel="">better working conditions</a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act" rel="">regulation</a><span> of unlawful monopolies, and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Food_and_Drug_Act" rel="">laws</a><span> preventing the sale of adulterated food and drugs. In China, there have been crackdowns on certain types of corruption — theft, embezzlement, and so on.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>While China still has large amounts of corruption in the form of bribes and access money paid to government officials, Yuen Yuen Ang argues in </span><em>China’s Gilded Age</em><span> that China has been able to channel its corruption into a pro-development force. Local bureaucrats are often paid by kickbacks, free meals, and so on, but these are linked to their region’s economic development: the more private investment, and the greater the success of local businesses, the greater these types of benefits they can extract. Interestingly, you see the same sort of idea in late 19th and early 20th century US, with the idea of “</span><a href="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/city/honest-graft" rel="">honest graft</a><span>.” Tammany Hall politician George Plunkitt noted that he never took money from any government coffers, but would make investments in land and other areas that he knew government projects would make more valuable, another type of corruption that’s coupled to development and economic growth.</span></p><p><span>I’m far from the first person to point out these resemblances between the U.S. and China. In </span><em>Age of Ambition</em><span>, Osnos notes that:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“China reminds me most of America at its own moment of transformation: the period that Mark Twain and Charles Warner named the Gilded Age, when ‘every man has his dream, his pet scheme’... As in China, the dawn of American fortune was accompanied by spectacular treachery… When I stood in the light of a new Chinese skyline, I sometimes thought of Gatsby’s New York – ‘always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and beauty in the world.’”</em></p></blockquote><p>Yuen Yuen Ang likewise notes the similarities between modern China and the Gilded Age U.S., stating that “both countries underwent a wrenching structural conversion from rural to urban and closed to global markets, producing once-in-a-generation opportunities for the politically connected and enterprising…to acquire fabulous wealth.”</p><p>The most interesting thing about these parallels, to me, is that the U.S. and China in many ways were starting from very different places. Prior to its opening up, China’s economy was entirely state-owned and state-planned, and its economic expansion was coupled with unwinding much of the state enterprise machinery, letting small businesses form and markets bloom.&nbsp;</p><p>The U.S., on the other hand, was on the other end of the spectrum. Prior to its economic expansion it had an incredibly weak state, and economy driven by very small enterprises. Its development was accompanied by the creation of large, powerful companies and institutions, and moving away from the “invisible hand” of the market and towards the “visible hand” of exchanges of goods and services mediated within very large organizations.</p><p><span>China’s success came from finding ways to mobilize its huge number of people and hasn’t necessarily been focused on operating at the frontier of efficiency. The U.S., on the other hand, despite its comparatively large population, had a chronic shortage of labor, and much of its development was focused on developing less labor-intensive manufacturing technologies like the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_system_of_manufacturing" rel="">American System</a><span>. China built its success on the back of inexpensive labor, and it remains a middle income country. In the U.S., labor has never been cheap; the U.S. had </span><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-decline-and-fall-of-britain/" rel="">nearly</a><span> the GDP per capita of Britain as early as the 1820s, and it had the highest GDP per capita in the world by the 1880s. But despite these differences, the logic of development pulled the U.S. and China along very similar paths. Both countries could exploit very large markets (both at home and abroad), and operated their industries at very large scales in order to do so. In both countries, this required a novel set of institutions that was radically different from what came before, and the transformation that created those institutions spawned cultures with many similarities.</span></p><p><em>Thanks to Dan Wang for reading a draft of this.

 <p><span>Posted by the </span><span><a href="#bigsleepteam">Big Sleep team</a></span></p>
 <p><span>Introduction</span></p>
 <p><span>In our previous post, </span><span><a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2024/06/project-naptime.html">Project Naptime: Evaluating Offensive Security Capabilities of Large Language Models</a></span><span>, we introduced our framework for large-language-model-assisted vulnerability research and demonstrated its potential by improving the state-of-the-art performance on Meta's CyberSecEval2 benchmarks. Since then, Naptime has evolved into Big Sleep, a collaboration between Google Project Zero and Google DeepMind.</span></p>
 <p><span>Today, we're excited to share the first real-world vulnerability discovered by the Big Sleep agent</span><span>: an exploitable stack buffer underflow in </span><span><a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a></span><span>, a widely used open source database engine. We discovered the </span><span><a href="https://project-zero.issues.chromium.org/issues/372435124">vulnerability</a></span><span>&nbsp;and reported it to the developers in early October, who </span><span><a href="https://sqlite.org/src/info/41d58a014ce89356">fixed it</a></span><span>&nbsp;on the same day. Fortunately, we found this issue </span><span>before it appeared in an official release, so SQLite users were not impacted</span><span>.</span></p>
 <p><span>We believe this is the first public example of an AI agent finding a previously unknown exploitable memory-safety issue in widely used real-world software. Earlier this year at the DARPA AIxCC event, Team Atlanta </span><span><a href="https://team-atlanta.github.io/blog/post-asc-sqlite/">discovered a null-pointer dereference</a></span><span>&nbsp;in SQLite, which inspired us to use it for our testing to see if we could find a more serious vulnerability.</span></p>
 <p><span>We think that this work has tremendous defensive potential. Finding vulnerabilities in software before it's even released, means that there's no scope for attackers to compete: the vulnerabilities are fixed before attackers even have a chance to use them. Fuzzing has helped significantly, but we need an approach that can help defenders to find the bugs that are difficult (or impossible) to find by fuzzing, and we're hopeful that AI can narrow this gap. We think that this is a promising path towards finally turning the tables and achieving an asymmetric advantage for defenders.</span></p>
 <p><span>The vulnerability itself is quite interesting, along with the fact that the existing testing infrastructure for SQLite (both through OSS-Fuzz, and the project's own infrastructure) did not find the issue, so we did some further investigation.</span></p>
 <p><span>Methodology</span></p>
 <p><span>A key motivating factor for Naptime and now for Big Sleep has been the </span><span><a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/0-days-exploited-wild-2022/%23:~:text%3DOver%252040%2525%2520of%2520the%25200%252Ddays%2520discovered%2520were%2520variants%2520of%2520previously%2520reported%2520vulnerabilities">continued in-the-wild discovery</a></span><span>&nbsp;of exploits for variants of previously found and patched vulnerabilities. As this trend continues, it's clear that fuzzing is not succeeding at catching such variants, and that for attackers, manual variant analysis is a cost-effective approach.</span></p>
 <p><span>We also feel that this variant-analysis task is a better fit for current LLMs than the more general open-ended vulnerability research problem. By providing a starting point – such as the details of a previously fixed vulnerability – we remove a lot of ambiguity from vulnerability research, and start from a concrete, well-founded theory: "This was a previous bug; there is probably another similar one somewhere".</span></p>
 <p><span>Our project is still in the research stage, and we are currently using small programs with known vulnerabilities to evaluate progress. Recently, we decided to put our models and tooling to the test by running our first extensive, real-world variant analysis experiment on SQLite. We collected a number of recent commits to the SQLite repository, manually removing trivial and documentation-only changes. We then adjusted the prompt to provide the agent with both the commit message and a diff for the change, and asked the agent to review the current repository (at </span><span><a href="https://sqlite.org/src/info/2f7eab381e167609">HEAD</a></span><span>) for related issues that might not have been fixed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Discovered Vulnerability</span></p>
 <p><span>The vulnerability is an interesting one where a special sentinel value </span><span>-1</span><span>&nbsp;is used in an (otherwise) index-typed field </span><span>iColumn</span><span>:</span></p>
 <p><span></span><span>7476:</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>struct</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>sqlite3_index_constraint</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>{</span></p>

 <p><span>7480:</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>int</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>iTermOffset;</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>/*</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Used</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>internally</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>xBestIndex</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>should</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>ignore</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>*/</span></p>

 <p><span>This pattern creates a potential edge-case that needs to be handled by all code that uses the field, since the expectation would be that a valid column index is non-negative.</span></p>
 <p><span>The function </span><span><a href="https://sqlite.org/src/file?ci=2f7eab381e167609&amp;name=ext/misc/series.c&amp;ln=578-778">seriesBestIndex</a></span><span>&nbsp;failed to correctly handle this edge-case, resulting in a write into a stack buffer with a negative index when handling a query with a constraint on the </span><span>rowid</span><span>&nbsp;column. In the build that we provided to our agent, debug assertions were enabled, and this condition was checked by the assertion at line </span><span><a href="https://sqlite.org/src/file?ci=2f7eab381e167609&amp;name=ext/misc/series.c&amp;ln=706">706</a></span><span>:</span></p>

 <p><span>In a release build, however, this assertion is not present, and in our testing (this will vary depending on compiler and optimization level) the subsequent write at line </span><span><a href="https://sqlite.org/src/file?ci=2f7eab381e167609&amp;name=ext/misc/series.c&amp;ln=718">718</a></span><span>&nbsp;will write below the </span><span>aIdx</span><span>&nbsp;buffer, corrupting the least significant 32 bits of the </span><span>pConstraint</span><span>&nbsp;pointer, which will be dereferenced in the next iteration of the loop, leading to a likely exploitable condition.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, given this explanation of the vulnerability – it's not trivial (at least for us) as human researchers to understand precisely how to trigger it – clearly a constraint on the </span><span>ROWID</span><span>&nbsp;column would be a good starting point, but more detailed reading of the code would certainly be required. The agent already seems to know a lot more about SQLite than we do, so it can cut some corners!</span></p>
 <p><span>One common case of this is that the model would immediately use the </span><span>generate_series</span><span>&nbsp;virtual table when generating testcases. (We also saw cases where the model researched the available virtual tables first, but it's clearly able to apply pre-existing knowledge here). </span></p><h2 id="h.xd9od84oge6s"><span>Trajectory Highlights</span></h2>
 <p><span>In this successful run based on Gemini 1.5 Pro, the seed commit was </span><span><a href="https://sqlite.org/src/info/1976c3f7e1fe77cf">[1976c3f7]</a></span><span>; which is a fairly large and non-obvious change. The bug found by our agent is only loosely related to the changes in the seed commit - this is not uncommon in manual variant analysis, understanding one bug in a codebase often leads a researcher to other problems.<p>Selected highlights are below, with our commentary in </p></span><span>italics </span><span>– all text in the </span><span>ASSISTANT</span><span>&nbsp;blocks comes directly from the agent.</span></p>
 <p><span>The agent produces a reasonable assessment of the changes in the diff, and uses this to form a starting point for research:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>ASSISTANT</span></p>
 <p><span><br></span><span>The CL improves the handling of WHERE terms shared between OR branches in virtual table queries by introducing the </span><span>termFromWhereClause</span><span>&nbsp;function. This function retrieves a specific term from a WhereClause, considering nested clauses. Prior to this change, common terms were likely not handled correctly due to an incorrect mapping of term indices, potentially leading to inefficient query plans or incorrect results. The most likely vulnerability would involve incorrect handling of WHERE clause constraints within the </span><span>allocateIndexInfo</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>whereLoopAddVirtualOne</span><span>&nbsp;functions, where the CL has modified how constraint offsets are used with the new helper function. I'll first examine the </span><span>allocateIndexInfo</span><span>&nbsp;function.</span><span>. . .</span></p>
 
 <p><span>After a several (omitted) steps exploring the relevant code, the agent has formed a more concrete hypothesis and attempts to check it by running a modified version of the testcase from the patch, but this doesn't work since the testcase included in the patch relies on an extension that is not available in our configuration:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>TOOL</span><span>(debugger_run)</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The program exited without crashing or hitting the breakpoint. The exit code was 1.</span></p>
 <p><span>The output on STDERR was:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Runtime error near line 2: no such module: tcl</span></p>
 <p><span>Parse error near line 3: no such table: x1</span><span><br></span></p>
 <p><span><br></span><span>ASSISTANT</span></p>
 <p><span><br></span><span>The program terminated because the TCL module was not available. The tests rely on the TCL virtual table module, which needs to be enabled when compiling SQLite. The provided program input is based on the </span><span>bestindexC.test</span><span>&nbsp;file, which uses the TCL module to test virtual table best index selection.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>To fix this, the program input needs to be changed to use a different virtual table that does not require the TCL module. However, the vulnerability is related to virtual table query planning. So we still need a virtual table to trigger the issue.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>I will use the </span><span>code_browser_source</span><span>&nbsp;tool to search for examples of built-in virtual tables in SQLite. I'll then adapt the input to use one of these and set a breakpoint in </span><span>whereLoopAddVirtualOne</span><span>&nbsp;again.</span><span>. . .</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The agent adapts to this setback gracefully, recognises the steps it needs to take to fix the testcase, and a few steps later has retrieved all of the information it needs to build a testcase that reaches </span><span>whereLoopAddVirtualOne</span><span>:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>ASSISTANT</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The </span><span>sqlite3_create_module</span><span>&nbsp;function registers virtual table modules. The </span><span>shell.c</span><span>&nbsp;file contains several instances of this, including the </span><span>generate_series</span><span>, </span><span>fsdir</span><span>, </span><span>completion</span><span>, and </span><span>expert</span><span>&nbsp;modules. The json table also looks interesting. I'll focus on </span><span>generate_series</span><span>&nbsp;for now as a starting point. I'll try to craft a query that uses this module and might trigger incorrect constraint handling.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>. . .</span></p>
 <p><span><br></span><span>Note above that during the original discovery and reproduction of the vulnerability, the agent was quite vague about the "incorrect constraint handling" that it's trying to trigger; and in this case the full trajectories read a little bit like a human researcher - starting out with one idea, thinking of a few other ones while investigating, and in the end producing a test case that reproduces a slightly different bug. In this case, when </span><span>whereLoopAddVirtualOne</span><span>&nbsp;is invoked on a </span><span>generate_series</span><span>&nbsp;table, we end &nbsp;up in </span><span>seriesBestIndex</span><span>, where the constraint is indeed handled incorrectly.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, it's particularly interesting to see that once the program has crashed the model does a much better job of explaining things - while producing a root-cause analysis and a full crash report we can see the agent clearly crafting a testcase to trigger the specific, identified edge-case:</span><span><br></span></p>
 <p><span>ASSISTANT</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The relevant field is </span><span>iColumn</span><span>&nbsp;inside the </span><span>sqlite3_index_constraint</span><span>&nbsp;struct. This field represents the column number of the constraint. To cause the assertion failure, we need a constraint on a column with index greater than </span><span>3</span><span>&nbsp;or smaller than </span><span>1</span><span>.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Let's craft an SQL query that involves constraints on these columns. The </span><span>generate_series</span><span>&nbsp;table has columns named </span><span>value</span><span>, </span><span>start</span><span>, </span><span>step</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>stop</span><span>. The indexes are:</span></p>
 <p><span>- </span><span>value</span><span>: </span><span>0</span></p>
 <p><span>- </span><span>start</span><span>: </span><span>1</span></p>
 <p><span>- </span><span>step</span><span>: </span><span>2</span></p>
 <p><span>- </span><span>stop</span><span>: </span><span>3</span></p>
 
 <p><span>To trigger the bug, we can include a constraint on the ROWID. Constraints on the ROWID use </span><span>iColumn = -1</span><span>.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>Here is an example query:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>SELECT * FROM generate_series(1,10,1) WHERE ROWID = 1;</span></p>
 
 <p><span>This query should cause a crash in the </span><span>seriesBestIndex</span><span>&nbsp;function.</span><span>. . .</span></p>
 
 <p><span>At the end we get a clear and accurate summary of the issue that's almost ready to report directly!</span></p>
 <p><span>TOOL</span><span>(debugger_run)</span></p>
 
 <p><span>The program crashed: SIGABRT at :0.</span></p>
 <p><span>The output on STDERR was:</span></p>
 
 <p><span>sqlite3: src/shell.c:6816: int seriesBestIndex(sqlite3_vtab *, sqlite3_index_info *): Assertion `iCol&gt;=0 &amp;&amp; &nbsp;iCol&lt;=2' failed.</span></p>
 
 
 <p><span>ASSISTANT</span><span>(report_success)</span></p>
 <p><span><br>The program crashes with the input </span><span>SELECT * FROM generate_series(1,10,1) WHERE ROWID = 1;</span><span>&nbsp;due to an assertion failure in function </span><span>seriesBestIndex</span><span>. <p>The assertion </p></span><span>assert(iCol&gt;=0 &amp;&amp; iCol&lt;=2)</span><span>&nbsp;fails because the </span><span>iColumn</span><span>&nbsp;field in the </span><span>sqlite3_index_info</span><span>&nbsp;struct can contain values outside of the valid range for column indexes, such as </span><span>-1</span><span>&nbsp;when a constraint involves the ROWID.</span></p>
 
 <p><span>This leads to </span><span>iCol</span><span>&nbsp;being calculated as </span><span>-2</span><span>, causing the assertion to fail.</span></p>
 <h2 id="h.n8khgp4u0snd"><span>What about Fuzzing?</span></h2>
 <p><span>Given the apparent simplicity of the reproduction case, an obvious question arises: why wasn’t this bug discovered earlier by traditional fuzzing? The “simple” answer lies in the configuration of the fuzzing harnesses. The harness used by OSS-Fuzz isn't built with the </span><span>generate_series</span><span>&nbsp;extension enabled, and the alternative </span><span>fuzzingshell.c</span><span>&nbsp;harness contained an older version of the </span><span>seriesBestIndex</span><span>&nbsp;function, unaffected by the bug. Although the </span><span><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/afl/dir?ci=tip">SQLite AFL repo</a></span><span>&nbsp;contains a configuration for fuzzing the same CLI binary that we provided to the Big Sleep agent, it appears not to be widely used.</span></p>
 <p><span>To understand whether the bug is truly “shallow", we attempted to rediscover it through fuzzing. We followed the fuzzing instructions from the </span><span><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/afl/doc/trunk/README.md">SQLite documentation</a></span><span>&nbsp;and used the CLI target. We also verified that the fuzzing corpus contained the required </span><span>generate_series</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>rowid</span><span>&nbsp;keywords before launching an AFL run. However, the issue remained undiscovered after 150 CPU-hours of fuzzing.</span></p>
 <p><span>We then tried to simplify the task for the fuzzer by, for example, adding the necessary keywords to AFL's SQL dictionary. However, it seems the bug can only be quickly found if the corpus contains an example very close to the crashing input, as code coverage doesn't appear to be a reliable guide for this particular issue.</span></p>
 <p><span>Admittedly, AFL isn't the most suitable tool for a text-based format like SQL, where most inputs are syntactically invalid and will be rejected by the parser. Nevertheless, it's interesting to compare this result with </span><span><a href="https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2015/04/finding-bugs-in-sqlite-easy-way.html">Michal Zalewski’s blog post on fuzzing SQLite</a></span><span>&nbsp;from 2015. Back then, AFL was quite effective at uncovering bugs in SQLite; after years of fuzzing, it seems the tool has reached a natural saturation point. While our results so far seem minor in comparison to the dramatic step-change in effectiveness that came with the release of AFL, it's interesting to see that it has its own strengths and might be able to effectively uncover a </span><span>distinct</span><span>&nbsp;set of vulnerabilities.</span></p><h2 id="h.85i6df6n8fiq"><span>Conclusion</span></h2>
 <p><span>For the team this is a moment of validation and success - finding a vulnerability in a widely-used and well fuzzed open source project is </span><span>an exciting result! </span><span>When provided with the right tools, current LLMs can perform vulnerability research.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, we want to reiterate that these are highly experimental results</span><span>. The position of the Big Sleep team is that at present, it's likely that a target-specific fuzzer would be at least as effective (at finding vulnerabilities). </span></p>
 <p><span>We hope that in the future this effort will lead to a significant advantage to defenders - with the potential not only to find crashing testcases, but also to provide high-quality root-cause analysis, triaging and fixing issues could be much cheaper and more effective in the future. We aim to continue sharing our research in this space, keeping the gap between the public state-of-the-art and private state-of-the-art as small as possible. </span><span>The Big Sleep team will continue to work in this space, advancing Project Zero's mission of making 0-day hard.</span></p><h3 id="h.1tivp1wdbnt9"><span><a id="bigsleepteam">The Big Sleep Team</a></span></h3>

Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific talents.</p><p>--</p><p>Junior Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time</p><p>We're looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects.

<p>Becky Carroll was missing a few teeth, others were stained or crooked. Ashamed, she smiled with lips pressed closed. Her dentist offered to fix most of her teeth with root canals and crowns, Carroll said, but she was wary of traveling a long road of dental work.</p>
<p>Then Carroll saw a TV commercial for another path: ClearChoice Dental Implant Centers. The company advertises that it can give patients “<a href="https://www.clearchoice.com/why-clearchoice/one-day-dental-implants/">a new smile in as little as one day</a>” by surgically replacing teeth instead of fixing them.</p>
<p>So Carroll saved and borrowed for the surgery, she said. In an interview and a lawsuit, Carroll said that at a ClearChoice clinic in New Jersey in 2021, she agreed to pay $31,000 to replace all her natural upper teeth with pearly white prosthetic ones. What came next, Carroll said, was “like a horror movie.”</p>
<p>Carroll alleged that her anesthesia wore off during implant surgery, so she became conscious as her teeth were removed and titanium screws were twisted into her jawbone. Afterward, Carroll’s prosthetic teeth were so misaligned that she was largely unable to chew for more than two years until she could afford corrective surgery at another clinic, according to a sworn deposition from her lawsuit.</p>
<p>ClearChoice has denied Carroll’s claims of malpractice and negligence in court filings and did not respond to requests for comment on the ongoing case.</p>
<p>“I thought implants would be easier, and all at once, so you didn’t have to keep going back to the dentist,” Carroll, 52, said in an interview. “But I should have asked more questions … like, Can they save these teeth?”</p>
<p>Dental implants have been used for more than half a century to surgically replace missing or damaged teeth with artificial duplicates, often with picture-perfect results. While implant dentistry was once the domain of a small group of highly trained dentists and specialists, tens of thousands of dental providers now offer the surgery and place millions of implants each year in the US.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Amid this booming industry, some implant experts worry that many dentists are losing sight of dentistry’s fundamental goal of preserving natural teeth and have become too willing to remove teeth to make room for expensive implants, according to a months-long investigation by KFF Health News and CBS News. In interviews, 10 experts said they had each given second opinions to multiple patients who had been recommended for mouths full of implants that the experts ultimately determined were not necessary. Separately, lawsuits filed across the country have alleged that implant patients like Carroll have experienced painful complications that have required corrective surgery, while other lawsuits alleged dentists at some implant clinics have persuaded, pressured, or forced patients to remove teeth unnecessarily.</p>
<p>The experts warn that implants, for a single tooth or an entire mouth, expose patients to costs and surgery complications, plus a new risk of future dental problems with fewer treatment options because their natural teeth are forever gone.</p>
<p>“There are many cases where teeth, they’re perfectly fine, and they’re being removed unnecessarily,” said William Giannobile, <a href="https://hsdm.harvard.edu/people/wiliam-v-giannobile">dean of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine</a>. “I really hate to say it, but many of them are doing it because these procedures, from a monetary standpoint, they’re much more beneficial to the practitioner.”</p>
<p>Giannobile and nine other experts say they are combating a false public perception that implants are more durable and longer-lasting than natural teeth, which some believe stems in part from advertising on TV and social media. Implants require upkeep, and although they can’t get cavities, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26701919/">studies have shown</a> that patients can be susceptible to infections in the gums and bone around their implants.</p>
<p>“Just because somebody can afford implants doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re a good candidate,” said George Mandelaris, a Chicago-area periodontist and member of the American Academy of Periodontology Board of Trustees. “When an implant has infection, or when an implant has bone loss, an implant dies a much quicker death than do teeth.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>In its simplest form, implant surgery involves extracting a single tooth and replacing it with a metal post that is screwed into the jaw and then affixed with a prosthetic tooth commonly made of porcelain, also known as a crown. Patients can also use “full-arch” or “All-on-4” implants to replace all their upper or lower teeth—or all their teeth.</p>
<p>For this story, KFF Health News and CBS News sought interviews with large dental chains whose clinics offer implant surgery—ClearChoice, Aspen Dental, Affordable Care, and Dental Care Alliance—each of which declined to be interviewed or did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Association of Dental Support Organizations, which represents these companies and others like them, also declined an interview request.</p>
<p>ClearChoice, which specializes in full-arch implants, did not answer more than two dozen questions submitted in writing. In an emailed statement, the company said full-arch implants “have become a well-accepted standard of care for patients with severe tooth loss and teeth with poor prognosis.”</p>
<p>“The use of full-arch restorations reflects the evolution of modern dentistry, offering patients a solution that restores their ability to eat, speak, and live comfortably—far beyond what traditional dentures can provide,” the company said.</p>
<p>Carroll said she regrets not letting her dentist try to fix her teeth and rushing to ClearChoice for implants.</p>
<p>“Because it was a nightmare,” she said.</p>

<h2>“They are not teeth”</h2>
<p>Dental implant surgery can be a godsend for patients with unsalvageable teeth. Several experts said implants can be so transformative that their invention should have contended for a Nobel Prize. And yet, these experts still worry that implants are overused, because it is generally better for patients to have their natural teeth.</p>
<p>Paul Rosen, a Pennsylvania periodontist who said he has worked with implants for more than three decades, said many patients believe a “fallacy” that implants are “bulletproof.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“You can’t just have an implant placed and go off riding into the sunset,” Rosen said. “In many instances, they need more care than teeth because they are not teeth.”</p>
<p>Generally, a single implant costs a few thousand dollars while full-arch implants cost tens of thousands. Neither procedure is well covered by dental insurance, so many clinics partner with credit companies that offer loans for implant surgeries. At ClearChoice, for example, loans can be <a href="https://www.clearchoice.com/dental-implant-financing-and-costs/dental-implant-financing/">as large as $65,000 paid off over 10 years</a>, according to the company’s website.</p>
<p>Despite the price, implants are more popular than ever. Sales increased by more than 6 percent on average each year since 2010, culminating in more than 3.7 million implants sold in the US in 2022, according to a 2023 report produced by iData Research, a health care market research firm.</p>
<p>Some worry implant dentistry has gone too far. In 10 interviews, dentists and dental specialists with expertise in implants said they had witnessed the overuse of implants firsthand. Each expert said they’d examined multiple patients in recent years who were recommended for full-arch implants by other dentists despite their teeth being treatable with conventional dentistry.</p>
<p>Giannobile, the Harvard dean, said he had given second opinions to “dozens” of patients who were recommended for implants they did not need.</p>
<p>“I see many of these patients now that are coming in and saying, ‘I’ve been seen, and they are telling me to get my entire dentition—all of my teeth—extracted.’ And then I’ll take a look at them and say that we can preserve most of your teeth,” Giannobile said.</p>
<p>Tim Kosinski, who is a representative of the <a href="https://www.agd.org/">Academy of General Dentistry</a> and said he has placed more than 19,000 implants, said he examines as many as five patients a month who have been recommended for full-arch implants that he deems unnecessary.</p>
<p>“There is a push in the profession to remove teeth that could be saved,” Kosinski said. “But the public isn’t aware.”</p>

<p>Luiz Gonzaga, a periodontist and prosthodontist at the University of Florida, said he, too, had turned away patients who wanted most or all their teeth extracted. Gonzaga said some had received implant recommendations that he considered “an atrocity.”</p>
<p>“You don’t go to the hospital and tell them ‘I broke my finger a couple of times. This is bothering me. Can you please cut my finger off?’ No one will do that,” Gonzaga said. “Why would I extract your tooth because you need a root canal?”</p>
<p>Jaime Lozada, director of an elite dental implant residency program at Loma Linda University, said he’d not only witnessed an increase in dentists extracting “perfectly healthy teeth” but also treated a rash of patients with mouths full of ill-fitting implants that had to be surgically replaced.</p>
<p>Lozada said in August that he’d treated seven such patients in just three months.</p>
<p>“When individuals just make a decision of extracting teeth to make it simple and make money quick, so to speak, that’s where I have a problem,” Lozada said. “And it happens quite often.”</p>
<p>When full-arch implants fail, patients sometimes don’t have enough jawbone left to anchor another set. These patients have little choice but to get implants that reach into cheekbones, said Sohail Saghezchi, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the University of California-San Francisco.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of like a last resort,” Saghezchi said. “If those fail, you don’t have anywhere else to go.”</p>

<h2>“It was horrendous dentistry”</h2>
<p>Most of the experts interviewed for this article said their rising alarm corresponded with big changes in the availability of dental implants. Implants are now offered by more than 70,000 dental providers nationwide, two-thirds of whom are general dentists, according to the iData Research report.</p>
<p>Dentists are not required to learn how to place implants in dental school, nor are they required to complete implant training before performing the surgery in nearly all states. This year, Oregon started <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/dentistry/Documents/Dental%20Implant%20Rules%20FAQ%20Guidance%20-%20FINAL.pdf">requiring dentists to complete 56 hours</a> of hands-on training before placing any implants. Stephen Prisby, executive director of the Oregon Board of Dentistry, said the requirement—the first and only of its kind in the US—was a response to dozens of investigations in the state into botched surgeries and other implant failures, split evenly between general dentists and specialists.</p>

<p>“I was frankly stunned at how bad some of these dentists were practicing,” Prisby said. “It was horrendous dentistry.”</p>
<p>Many dental clinics that offer implants have consolidated into chains owned by private equity firms that have bought out much of implant dentistry. In health care, private equity investment is sometimes <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/private-equity/">criticized for overtreatment and prioritizing short-term profit over patients</a>.</p>
<p>Private equity firms have spent about $5 billion in recent years to buy large dental chains that offer implants at hundreds of clinics owned by individual dentists and dental specialists. ClearChoice was bought for an estimated $1.1 billion in 2020 by <a href="https://www.aspendental.com/">Aspen Dental</a>, which is owned by three private equity firms, according to <a href="https://pitchbook.com/">PitchBook</a>, a research firm focused on the private equity industry. Private equity firms also bought Affordable Care, whose largest clinic brand is <a href="https://www.affordabledentures.com/">Affordable Dentures &amp; Implants</a>, for an estimated $2.7 billion in 2021, according to PitchBook. And the private equity wing of the Abu Dhabi government bought <a href="https://www.dentalcarealliance.net/">Dental Care Alliance</a>, which offers implants at many of its affiliated clinics, for an estimated $1 billion in 2022, according to PitchBook.</p>
<p>ClearChoice and Aspen Dental each said in email statements that the companies’ private equity owners “do not have influence or control over treatment recommendations.” Both companies said dentists or dental specialists make all clinical decisions.</p>
<p>Private equity deals involving dental practices increased ninefold from 2011 to 2021, according to an <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2023.00574">American Dental Association study</a> published in August. The study also said investors showed an interest in oral surgery, possibly because of the “high prices” of implants.</p>
<p>“Some argue this is a negative thing,” said Marko Vujicic, vice president of the association’s Health Policy Institute, who co-authored the study. “On the other hand, some would argue that involvement of private equity and outside capital brings economies of scale, it brings efficiency.”</p>
<p>Edwin Zinman, a San Francisco dental malpractice attorney and former periodontist who has filed hundreds of dental lawsuits over four decades, said he believed many of the worst fears about private equity owners had already come true in implant dentistry.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>“They’ve sold a lot of [implants], and some of it unnecessarily, and too often done negligently, without having the dentists who are doing it have the necessary training and experience,” Zinman said. “It’s for five simple letters: M-O-N-E-Y.”</p>

<h2>Hundreds of implant clinics with no specialists</h2>
<p>For this article, journalists from KFF Health News and CBS News analyzed the webpages for more than 1,000 clinics in the nation’s largest private equity-owned dental chains, all of which offer some implants. The analysis found that more than 70 percent of those clinics listed only general dentists on their websites and did not appear to employ the specialists—oral surgeons, periodontists, or prosthodontists—who traditionally have more training with implants.</p>
<p>Affordable Dentures &amp; Implants listed specialists at fewer than 5 percent of its more than 400 clinics, according to the analysis. The rest were staffed by general dentists, most of whom did not list credentialing from implant training organizations, according to the analysis.</p>
<p>ClearChoice, on the other hand, employs at least one oral surgeon or prosthodontist at each of its more than 100 centers, according to the analysis. But its new parent company, Aspen Dental, which offers implants in many of its more than 1,100 clinics, does not list any specialists at many of those locations.</p>
<p>Not everyone is worried about private equity in implant dentistry. In interviews arranged by the <a href="https://www.aaid.com/">American Academy of Implant Dentistry</a>, which trains dentists to use implants, two other implant experts did not express concerns about private equity firms.</p>
<p>Brian Jackson, a former academy president and implant specialist in New York, said he believed dentists are too ethical and patients are too smart to be pressured by private equity owners “who will never see a patient.”</p>
<p>Jumoke Adedoyin, a chief clinical officer for Affordable Care, who has placed implants at an Affordable Dentures &amp; Implants clinic in the Atlanta suburbs for 15 years, said she had never felt pressure from above to sell implants.</p>

<p>“I’ve actually felt more pressure sometimes from patients who have gone around and been told they need to take their teeth out,” she said. “They come in and, honestly, taking a look at them, maybe they don’t need to take all their teeth out.”</p>
<p>Still, lawsuits filed across the country have alleged that dentists at implant clinics have extracted patients’ teeth unnecessarily.</p>
<p>For example, in Texas, a patient alleged in a 2020 lawsuit that an Affordable Care dentist removed “every single tooth from her mouth when such was not necessary,” then stuffed her mouth with gauze and left her waiting in the lobby as he and his staff left for lunch. In Maryland, a patient alleged in a 2021 lawsuit that ClearChoice “convinced” her to extract “eight healthy upper teeth,” by “greatly downplay[ing] the risks.” In Florida, a patient alleged in a 2023 lawsuit that ClearChoice provided her with no other treatment options before extracting all her teeth, “which was totally unnecessary.”</p>
<p>ClearChoice and Affordable Care denied wrongdoing in their respective lawsuits, then privately settled out of court with each patient. ClearChoice and Affordable Care did not respond to requests for comment submitted to the companies or attorneys. Lawyers for all three plaintiffs declined to comment on these lawsuits or did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Fred Goldberg, a Maryland dental malpractice attorney who said he has represented at least six clients who sued ClearChoice, said each of his clients agreed to get implants after meeting with a salesperson—not a dentist.</p>
<p>“Every client I’ve had who has gone to ClearChoice has started off meeting a salesperson and actually signing up to get their financing through ClearChoice before they ever meet with a dentist,” Goldberg said. “You meet with a salesperson who sells you on what they like to present as the best choice, which is almost always that they’re going to take out all your natural teeth.”</p>
<p>Becky Carroll, the ClearChoice patient from New Jersey, told a similar story.</p>
<p>Carroll said in her lawsuit that she met first with a ClearChoice salesperson referred to as a “patient education consultant.” In an interview, Carroll said the salesperson encouraged her to borrow money from family members for the surgery and it was not until after she agreed to a loan and passed a credit check that a ClearChoice dentist peered into her mouth.</p>
<p>“It seems way backwards,” Carroll said. “They just want to know you’re approved before you get to talk to a dentist.”</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Transformers have become the predominant architecture in foundation models due to their excellent performance across various domains. However, the substantial cost of scaling these models remains a significant concern. This problem arises primarily from their dependence on a fixed number of parameters within linear projections. When architectural modifications (e.g., channel dimensions) are introduced, the entire model typically requires retraining from scratch. As model sizes continue growing, this strategy results in increasingly high computational costs and becomes unsustainable. To overcome this problem, we introduce TokenFormer, a natively scalable architecture that leverages the attention mechanism not only for computations among input tokens but also for interactions between tokens and model parameters, thereby enhancing architectural flexibility. By treating model parameters as tokens, we replace all the linear projections in Transformers with our token-parameter attention layer, where input tokens act as queries and model parameters as keys and values. This reformulation allows for progressive and efficient scaling without necessitating retraining from scratch. Our model scales from 124M to 1.4B parameters by incrementally adding new key-value parameter pairs, achieving performance comparable to Transformers trained from scratch while greatly reducing training costs. Code and models are available at \url{<a href="https://github.com/Haiyang-W/TokenFormer" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}.

<p>Bedtime routines are a well-documented, effective strategy for <span><a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/children-and-sleep/bedtime-routine">improving sleep in children</a></span>. Incorporating relaxing activities before bed is also recommended for adults to <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-habits">improve sleep habits</a> and get more sleep overall.</p>



<p>Your <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene/bedtime-routine-for-adults">routine at night</a> can include any number of relaxing activities:</p>



<ul>
<li><b>Taking a Warm Shower or Bath:</b> A shower or a bath can help you destress and relax before bedtime. Plus, research shows that this routine <span><a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene/shower-before-bed">lowers your core body temperature</a>,</span> which can help you fall asleep faster and improve your quality of sleep.</li>



<li><b>Meditation:</b> The practice of quiet, concentrated attention has a number of health benefits. <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/meditation-for-sleep">Meditation</a> near bedtime may help reduce anxiety that might otherwise keep you awake, limit symptoms of insomnia, and reduce sleep disturbances.</li>



<li><b>Reading: </b>Reading a book is another good way to relax and induce sleepiness. It is important to note that some researchers have found that reading on a tablet rather than a book can make you less sleepy and <span>    <span data-source-index="2">
        <span>delay deep sleep</span>
        <span>
           
                         <span data-source-id="81102" data-source-index="2" tabindex="0">
            </span>
                <span>
                    
                </span>
                                    </span>
    </span> 
    </span>.</li>



<li><b>Listening to Music: </b>Gentle or calming music can also help you unwind before bedtime. Research shows that listening to gentle <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/noise-and-sleep/music">music</a> <span>induces relaxation and improves sleep quality</span>.</li>



<li><b>Journaling:</b> If stress and to-do lists are keeping you up at night, try writing your concerns down in a <span>    <span data-source-index="3">
        <span>journal</span>
        <span>
           
                         <span data-source-id="81342" data-source-index="3" tabindex="0">
            </span>
                <span>
                    
                </span>
                                    </span>
    </span> 
    </span>. Studies have found that offloading these mental problems onto paper may help you fall asleep faster.</li>
</ul>







        


                    
    









<p>While it may be tempting to scroll on your phone to relax before bedtime, the habit could be keeping you up later. Research shows that <span><a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/blue-light">blue light suppresses</a></span> the body’s production of melatonin, the sleep hormone. This can be helpful in the morning, when you want to wake up. However, blue light exposure in the evening could make you take longer to fall asleep, get less sleep overall, and get lower-quality sleep.</p>



<p>In addition to cell phones, common electronics such as <span>    <span data-source-index="4">
        <span>TVs, computers, tablets</span>
        <span>
           
                         <span data-source-id="81036" data-source-index="4" tabindex="0">
            </span>
                <span>
                    
                </span>
                                    </span>
    </span> 
    </span>, and even backlit e-books all emit blue light. To avoid melatonin suppression and staying up later than you want, it is best to limit the use of these types of devices in the hours before bedtime. Some experts recommend keeping the devices out of the bedroom altogether to resist the temptation to <span>    <span data-source-index="5">
        <span>check notifications at night</span>
        <span>

                                    </span>
    </span> 
    </span>.</p>

Maintain a Consistent Sleep Schedule
</h2>



<p>If you go to sleep at different times each day, it can be difficult to fall asleep earlier. Waking up and going to bed at the same time each day helps your body develop a routine. Even on weekends and days you would like to sleep in, it helps to maintain a <span><a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene/how-to-reset-your-sleep-routine">consistent sleep schedule</a></span>. As you adjust to an earlier sleep schedule, it can help to make the change in smaller 15-minute increments.</p>



<p>Many people find that napping too late in the day can interfere with nighttime sleep. If you are trying to go to bed earlier, you may want to avoid naps in the afternoon and evening.</p>



        






<p>Studies have shown that <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/physical-activity/exercise-and-sleep">exercising regularly</a> in line with public health recommendations leads to better sleep. However, experts generally recommend against intensive exercise right before bedtime. Vigorous exercise less than an hour before you go to bed may <span>    <span data-source-index="6">
        <span>delay falling asleep</span>
        <span>

                                    </span>
    </span> 
    </span> and reduce overall sleep time.</p>



<p>If you want to exercise before bedtime, try a low- or moderate-intensity activity. Some meditative movements such as yoga, tai chi, or qigong include combinations of gentle stretching and breathing exercises. These activities can help you relax before bedtime. <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/physical-activity/yoga-and-sleep">Yoga</a> in particular has been shown to help improve the management of <span>sleep problems </span>and <span>    <span data-source-index="7">

<p>Another <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene/healthy-sleep-tips">healthy sleep tip</a> is to make sure your room is conducive to sleep. There are many steps you can take to create a comfortable bedroom environment:</p>



<ul>
<li><b>Keep Your Room Dark:</b> Sunlight, lamps, and light from electronics can all keep you awake longer than you want. Heavy curtains or blackout curtains can eliminate light from the sun or streetlights. You can also use an eye mask.</li>



<li><strong>Lower The Temperature:</strong> A slightly cool room is generally ideal for sleep. If you live in a warm climate, it may be helpful to turn down the thermostat, use a fan, and invest in seasonally appropriate bedding.</li>



<li><strong>Eliminate Noise:</strong> A quiet space allows you to drift off to sleep without distraction. Earplugs are a great way to block out sound. <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-sleep-products/best-white-noise-machines">White noise machines</a> or fans can also conceal unwanted noises.</li>



<li><b>Reserve the Bedroom for Sleep: </b>To strengthen the mental association between <span>    <span data-source-index="8">
        <span>your bed and sleeping</span>
        <span>
           
                         <span data-source-id="83516" data-source-index="8" tabindex="0">
            </span>
                <span>
                    
                </span>
                                    </span>
    </span> 
    </span>, avoid bringing your laptop to bed. Along similar lines, if you cannot fall asleep after 20 minutes, go to another room and do a relaxing activity until you feel sleepy.</li>
</ul>







<p>Although a cup of coffee late in the day may give you the boost you need to wrap up a project, it may also keep you up at night. Experts recommend avoiding stimulants including coffee, tea, and energy drinks four to six hours before bedtime.</p>







<p>A number of natural sleep aids can help you fall asleep earlier:</p>



<ul>
<li><b>Melatonin: </b>Melatonin is a hormone that helps regulate your <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm">circadian rhythm</a> by <span>    <span data-source-index="9">

    </span> 
    </span>. While not designed to be a long-term solution, <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/melatonin">melatonin supplements</a> taken shortly before bedtime may help some people drift off to sleep sooner.</li>



<li><strong>Herbal Tea:</strong> Preliminary studies have demonstrated that drinking certain types of <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-aids/best-tea-for-sleep">herbal tea</a> can reduce fatigue and <span>    <span data-source-index="10">

                                    </span>

<a href="https://npmjs.com/package/ink" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c3945c02df6ce45f8077d2353372ce54d5c6292df448268ba1db015979bd97bf/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6e706d2f646d2f696e6b3f6c6f676f3d6e706d" alt="npm" data-canonical-src="https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/ink?logo=npm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Ink provides the same component-based UI building experience that React offers in the browser, but for command-line apps.
It uses <a href="https://github.com/facebook/yoga">Yoga</a> to build Flexbox layouts in the terminal, so most CSS-like props are available in Ink as well.
If you are already familiar with React, you already know Ink.</p>
<p dir="auto">Since Ink is a React renderer, it means that all features of React are supported.
Head over to <a href="https://reactjs.org/" rel="nofollow">React</a> website for documentation on how to use it.
Only Ink's methods will be documented in this readme.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> This is documentation for Ink 4 and 5. If you're looking for docs on Ink 3, check out <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink/tree/v3.2.0">this release</a>.</p>

Ink requires the same Babel setup as you would do for regular React-based apps in the browser.
</p><p dir="auto">Set up Babel with a React preset to ensure all examples in this readme work as expected.
After <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/usage" rel="nofollow">installing Babel</a>, install <code>@babel/preset-react</code> and insert the following configuration in <code>babel.config.json</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-react"><pre>npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-react</pre></div>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{
	&quot;presets&quot;: [&quot;@babel/preset-react&quot;]
}"><pre>{
	<span>"presets"</span>: [<span><span>"</span>@babel/preset-react<span>"</span></span>]
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Next, create a file <code>source.js</code>, where you'll type code that uses Ink:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import React from 'react';
import {render, Text} from 'ink';

const Demo = () => <Text>Hello World</Text>;

render(<Demo />);"><pre><span>import</span> <span>React</span> <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span><span>render</span><span>,</span> <span>Text</span><span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'ink'</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>Demo</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>

<span>render</span><span>(</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Demo</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then, transpile this file with Babel:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npx babel source.js -o cli.js"><pre>npx babel source.js -o cli.js</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Now you can run <code>cli.js</code> with Node.js:</p>

<p dir="auto">If you don't like transpiling files during development, you can use <a href="https://github.com/vadimdemedes/import-jsx">import-jsx</a> or <a href="https://github.com/esbuild-kit/esm-loader">@esbuild-kit/esm-loader</a> to <code>import</code> a JSX file and transpile it on the fly.</p>

</details>
<p dir="auto">Ink uses <a href="https://github.com/facebook/yoga">Yoga</a> - a Flexbox layout engine to build great user interfaces for your CLIs using familiar CSS-like props you've used when building apps for the browser.
It's important to remember that each element is a Flexbox container.
Think of it as if each <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in the browser had <code>display: flex</code>.
See <a href="#box"><code>&lt;Box&gt;</code></a> built-in component below for documentation on how to use Flexbox layouts in Ink.
Note that all text must be wrapped in a <a href="#text"><code>&lt;Text&gt;</code></a> component.</p>

<p dir="auto">This component can display text, and change its style to make it bold, underline, italic or strikethrough.</p>

<p dir="auto">Transform a string representation of React components before they are written to output.
For example, you might want to apply a <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/ink-gradient">gradient to text</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/ink-link">add a clickable link</a> or <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/ink-big-text">create some text effects</a>.
These use cases can't accept React nodes as input, they are expecting a string.
That's what <code>&lt;Transform&gt;</code> component does, it gives you an output string of its child components and lets you transform it in any way.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> <code>&lt;Transform&gt;</code> must be applied only to <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> children components and shouldn't change the dimensions of the output, otherwise layout will be incorrect.</p>

It's a more convenient alternative to using <code>useStdin</code> and listening to <code>data</code> events.
The callback you pass to <code>useInput</code> is called for each character when user enters any input.
