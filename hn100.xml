We're building best-in-class machine learning and LLM-powered scoring for outbound sales teams. Our first product lives in Salesforce, ingests data from a variety of sources (firmographics, intent signals, marketing interactions, and prior engagement, including unstructured call transcripts, email chains, and notes), and combines LLMs with structured models to tell sales reps who they should reach out to each day (and why) to be laser-focused.</p><p>Our paying customers are fast-growing unicorns you've definitely heard of with large outbound sales motions, where the reps use us to target their outbound every day. Our thesis is that scoring (a known/"need to have" part of the stack -- but able to be done 10x better with LLMs because you can incorporate the goldmine of unstructured engagement data) is the right wedge into building the intelligence-driven outbound sales stack of the future that _actually works_ for large companies that need to generate millions of dollars in pipeline each quarter. Unlike most other companies in the space, we are explicitly building for companies of this scale and have them using our product today "in production."</p><p>We started with the vision of bringing AI to every business team, and have since narrowed down to focus on outbound sales teams who have a bunch of attractive properties (there are a _ton_ of them out there, they all use the same stack, the data is consolidated in one place, lift is measurable and directly touches the top line, etc.).</p><p>We're a team of 6 working in-person in NYC with a team from Scale/Waymo/Google/etc. (including some very senior folks) and looking to bring on another engineer as we start scaling our customer base.

I'm Guilherme, currently I work as a back-end developer with a degree in Software Engineering. I have a deep appreciation for seeing a "status 200" after completing an API, but I also enjoy the art of creating a beautiful front-end. My quest for growth extends beyond just programming; I am committed to evolving in areas like leadership and management, as I believe a good software engineer should be versatile and understand the full spectrum of software development. What truly motivates me is problem-solving. I believe it's in challenging situations that we learn and grow the most. I'm looking forward to bringing my passion for programming and my thirst for learning.</span></p></div></td></tr>

In the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that’s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.<p>Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.</p><p>How can this be, and how can we change it?</p><p>Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.</p><p>Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.</p><p>But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?</p><p>Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.</p><p>In 2022, Nuna will power over $70Bn of healthcare payments for over 6.5mn patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.</p><p>Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry’s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.</p><p>Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big. If yours are too, we want to work with you.</p><p>Open positions include:</p><p>* Engineering Manager, Data Pipelines</p><p>* Engineering Manager, DevProd</p><p>* Principal Software Engineers - Experiences</p><p>* Staff Software Engineers - Data Pipelines</p><p>* Staff and Senior Health Data Engineer</p><p>* Staff Software Engineer - Program Development Kit Engine</p><p>* Staff Software Engineer, Production Applications</p><p>* Manager - Health Data Analytics</p><p>Jobs Board: <a href="https://bit.ly/nuna-job-board" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://bit.ly/nuna-job-board</a></p><p>Frontend: React, Typescript</p><p>Backend: Django, Python, Scala</p><p>Cloud: AWS</p><p>Questions?

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2023/11/01/cpp23-garbage-collection">https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2023/11/01/cpp23-garbage-collection</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38097984">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If we go through the list of C++23 features, we can stumble upon the notion of garbage collection twice. Once among the language and once among the library features. Both entries refer to the same paper (<a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p2186r2.html">P2186R2</a>): garbage collection (<em>GC</em> in short) support is getting removed from C++. Just to make it clear, it’s not getting deprecated, but it’s getting completely removed. As it’s an unimplemented and unsupported feature, removing it is a nice act of language cleanup. It also wouldn’t be surprising if you never heard about GC in C++.</p><p>The first surprise this paper might give you is the fact that it talks about Garbage Collection and C++. When I was learning about C++ in comparison with Java a long long time ago, one advantage of C++ was deterministic memory management due to the lack of garbage collection.</p><p>As it turns out, in 2008 a <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2670.htm">minimal support for garbage collection and reachability-based leak detection</a> was added to C++0x. This paper was based on two earlier ones, you’ll find the reference for those in the previously referenced one. Standard-conform garbage collectors should take into account <em>strict pointer safety</em>. In fact, there is no such garbage collectors in major standard libraries.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2670.htm">N2670</a>) introduced the <code>std::pointer_safety</code> enumeration with three enumerators: <code>relaxed</code>, <code>preferred</code>, <code>strict</code>. When <code>std::get_pointer_safety()</code> is called, an implementation will return a value indicating how it treats pointers that are not safely derived (see below).</p><ul><li><code>pointer_safety::relaxed</code> is returned if non-safely-derived pointers will be treated the same as pointers that are safely derived for the duration of the program</li><li><code>pointer_safety::preferred</code> is returned if non-safely-derived pointers will be treated also the same as safely-derived pointers, but at the same time, the implementation is allowed to hint that it’s desirable to avoid dereferencing such pointers</li><li><code>pointer_safety::strict</code> is returned if non-safely-derived pointers might be treated differently than pointers that are safely derived.</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><p>A pointer value is a <em>safely-derived pointer</em> to a dynamic object only if it has pointer-to-object type and it is:</p><ul><li>the value returned by a call to the C++ standard library implementation of ::operator new(std::size_t); the result of taking the address of a subobject of an lvalue resulting from dereferencing a safely-derived pointer value;</li><li>the result of well-defined pointer arithmetic using a safely-derived pointer value;</li><li>the result of a well-defined pointer conversion of a safely-derived pointer value;</li><li>the result of a reinterpret_cast of a safely-derived pointer value;</li><li>the result of a reinterpret_cast of an integer representation of a safely-derived pointer value;</li><li>the value of an object whose value was copied from a traceable pointer object, where at the time of the copy the source object contained a copy of a safely-derived pointer value.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The standard lets implementations get away with basically any, even no-op implementations of GC and therefore it makes very little sense to have them in the standard. This doesn’t mean though that there haven’t been any successful garbage collectors for C++. The most often use case for GC implemented in C++ is having virtual machines written in C++ for other languages that are garbage collected. Different JavaScript VMs are like that and Lua as well.</p><p>But those garbage collectors also have their own set of requirements which are influenced much more by the language they help as their runtime than the C++ standard.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p2186r2.html">P2186R2</a> lists more concerns, I find it important to highlight two of them.</p><p>When you read above about <code>std::pointer_safety</code>, did you understand the difference between <code>relaxed</code> and <code>preferred</code>? If you did, please explain in the comments section. It’s totally unclear what well-behaved programs should do when they are given this information. It only brings confusion with any benefits.</p><p>The other problem is the definition of <em>safely-derived pointers</em>. In order to get a <em>safely-derived pointer</em>, you must use the global <code>::operator new</code> and there are no other implementation-defined ways to get such pointers. This is a problem because people often want to use other <code>new</code>s or want to avoid their usage completely to create objects in local arrays while avoiding heap usage.</p><p>As a consequence, garbage collection has been removed from C++23 with a great majority as well as pointer safety. The following names are removed from <code>std::</code></p><ul><li><code>declare_reachable</code></li><li><code>undeclare_reachable</code></li><li><code>declare_no_pointers</code></li><li><code>undeclare_no_pointers</code></li><li><code>get_pointer_safety</code></li><li><code>pointer_safety</code></li></ul><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Garbage collection and related features are being removed from C++23. If you are surprised to learn that the C++ standard had support for GC, you are not alone. It was unimplemented, confusing and pretty useless hence it’s removed. While there are existing garbage collectors, mostly for VMs written in C++ as a runtime for other languages, they are not impacted as they were not relying on the standard, exactly because of the reasons it’s getting removed.</p><p>A bit of simplification to the standard never hurts.</p><h2 id="connect-deeper">Connect deeper</h2><p>If you liked this article, please</p><ul><li>hit on the like button,</li><li><a href="http://eepurl.com/gvcv1j">subscribe to my newsletter</a></li><li>and let’s connect on <a href="https://twitter.com/SandorDargo">Twitter</a>!</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/sandordargo"><img data-src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png" src="https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png"></a></p></div></div>]]></description>

The researchers found, on average, that the amount of deep sleep declined between the two studies, indicating slow wave sleep loss with ageing. Over the next 17 years of follow-up, there were 52 cases of dementia. Even adjusting for age, sex, cohort, genetic factors, smoking status, sleeping medication use, antidepressant use, and anxiolytic use, each percentage decrease in deep sleep each year was associated with a 27 per cent increase in the risk of dementia.</p><p>“Slow-wave sleep, or deep sleep, supports the ageing brain in many ways, and we know that sleep augments the clearance of metabolic waste from the brain, including facilitating the clearance of proteins that aggregate in Alzheimer’s disease,” Associate Professor Pase said.</p><p>“However, to date we have been unsure of the role of slow-wave sleep in the development of dementia. Our findings suggest that slow wave sleep loss may be a modifiable dementia risk factor.”</p><p>Associate Professor Pase said that the Framingham Heart Study is a unique community-based cohort with repeated overnight polysomnographic (PSG) sleep studies and uninterrupted surveillance for incident dementia.</p><p>“We used these to examine how slow-wave sleep changed with ageing and whether changes in slow-wave sleep percentage were associated with the risk of later-life dementia up to 17 years later,” he said.</p><p>“We also examined whether genetic risk for Alzheimer’s Disease or brain volumes suggestive of early neurodegeneration were associated with a reduction in slow-wave sleep. We found that a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, but not brain volume, was associated with accelerated declines in slow wave sleep.”</p><p>Read the full paper in JAMA Neurology: <em>Association Between Slow-Wave Sleep Loss and Incident Dementia</em>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>I’ve been trying to invest more and more of my free time interacting with founders. I genuinely feel we’ve been through a lot with Sentry and I can provide some useful value to others. More so, I believe most people in this industry, most successful people, do others a disservice but not having honest conversations about the hardships and endurance it takes to succeed. As part of that I thought it’d be interesting, or at least therapeutic, to talk about some of the history in written form. I previously wrote about <a href="https://cra.mr/funding-sentry">Sentry’s Seed Funding</a>, but I want to go deeper on some other topics this time around. I’m not entirely sure what future topics I’ll cover, but hopefully you’ll find some value in it.</em></p>
<p>In today’s episode, let’s talk about Sentry’s origin, the early days iteration, and how we eventually started the business. If you have a side project you enjoy hacking on, or maybe you’re in the early stages of product-market-fit, this might be for you.</p>
<p>Sentry starts long before Sentry, with a once known project aptly named <a href="https://github.com/dcramer/django-db-log"><code>django-db-log</code></a>. Somewhere circa early 2008, on a long since forgotten chat medium called IRC. There was a small group of individuals - passionate individuals like <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2008/May/13/djangodblog/">Simon Willison</a> - who used to hang out in a channel called <code>#django-users</code>, and I was one of them. An anonymous user asked a simple question: how would you record errors to a dashboard? I obliged them with some <a href="https://github.com/dcramer/django-db-log/commit/3c2e87573d3bd16f61cf08fece0638cc47a4fc22">example code</a>, created a repository out of it, and the project was born. It’s not an overly interesting origin story, and its not filled with hardships, but its a very simple beginning.</p>
<p><img src="https://cra.mr/assets/sentry/django-sentry-details.png" alt="django-sentry"></p>
<p>Over the years I worked on a lot of open source. I <a href="https://cra.mr/work-life-balance">genuinely enjoy building things</a>, and Django was the community that really drew me in. I was fortunate enough that <em>no one cared about open source</em> so I could open source just about anything I worked on, whether it was from my side projects or random utilities I built at work. Over those early years, I open sourced dozens of small projects, many being extensions to the Django web framework: <a href="https://github.com/dcramer/django-devserver"><code>django-devserver</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/dcramer/django-sphinx"><code>django-sphinx</code></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dcramer/django-uuidfield"><code>django-uuidfield</code></a> for example. Of course <code>django-db-log</code> makes that list, but it focused on a passion I didn’t recognize at the time. That passion was solving my own problems- making my own work less tedious, my own day-to-day less frustrating. That passion, and that yearn for community, that more than anything else is what I contribute to both my personal success, as well as the success of our now business.</p>
<p>Eventually projects like <code>django-db-log</code> led to career opportunities. I have a vivid memory of going into an interview at Disqus (a startup I joined in 2010), watching them install the dependencies, and seeing several with my name on them. I had already interviewed and passed the assessment before I even talked to the team, and that’s a big deal for me given I am self-taught, come from rural America, and generally speaking have not had access to a lot of opportunities outside of ones I’ve created. That moment, and several other similar stories, are why I’ve been such a long believer in the power of Open Source for an individual’s career. As alluded, I joined Disqus, my first experience working at a “real” startup.</p>
<p><img src="https://cra.mr/assets/disqus-title-slide.png" alt="Disqus"></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus">Disqus</a> was an interesting learning ground for me. Going in I was ambitious and productive, but you don’t know what you don’t know, and at that age there was <em>a lot</em> I didn’t know. It’s the era where I learned (and eventually preached) the value of testing. It’s when I met many of my former colleagues who have become lifelong friends, some of whom still work at Sentry. Most importantly, it’s the era that allowed me to significantly expand my career options, both by investing time into projects like <code>django-db-log</code>, as well as speaking at various Python conferences. Disqus was also an enabler to my open source contributions, and importantly they relied on <code>django-db-log</code>. That meant that at various times I had <em>a financially motivated</em> reason to invest more time into it. As an example, in the early days (in fact, this might have been my first week on the job) I took down the entire platform. I don’t recall why, but I do recall it being extra painful due to <code>django-db-log</code>’s inability to scale. It couldn’t handle the huge volume of errors I had just thrown at it, and based on how little email we could receive over the next day, nor could gmail handle the amount of alerts that it generated.</p>
<p>If I had to pick the single most important event for Sentry, it would be this real-world use of the project at my full-time job. It meant investment in the project was based on practicalities, based on what we actually needed it to do at the organization. It meant that investments being made into the project were being made <em>for myself</em> to <em>improve my own day-to-day</em> as well as those of my team. I worked at Disqus from mid 2010 to early 2013, a little under three years. It was in that time that we decided to rename the project (first to <code>django-sentry</code> and eventually to <em>Sentry</em>). It was also at that time that we decided to bootstrap the company.</p>
<p>I don’t recall exactly when we started development on the cloud services for Sentry, but I do recall being thoroughly uninformed about what it’d take to launch a software-as-a-service company. You see, I had been pitched the idea of launching an AddOn on Heroku by one of the at-the-time PMs. It seemed like an easy concept: make Sentry easy to run on Heroku and make a few bucks. The ambitions were high at the time: “beer money” specifically is how I remember thinking about our potential success. When I kicked this off I recruited Chris Jennings (aka ckj) to help me start the company. He had already helped out on the project at Disqus so he was familiar with the project. I recall it being close to the end of the 2012, around Christmas, where things slow down at work. Chris and I decided to use our holiday vacation to get the company off the ground, to launch the Heroku AddOn. We then realized launching an AddOn meant building a cloud service…</p>
<p>Over those two weeks, or at least how I remember it, we had completed multi-organization support in Sentry, added in Stripe billing, and launched the product on top of Heroku. Stripe was a key ingredient that was extremely simple to integrate, especially with our silly naive business model at the time (a story for another post). While I’m sure I’m fudging the numbers a bit, I recall launching Sentry’s cloud service, a paid-only offering, to customers within a few weeks of starting development on it.</p>
<p><strong>We launched it and that same day we had our first paying customer. Seven dollars baby!</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cra.mr/assets/sentry/heroku-addon.png" alt="Heroku AddOn"></p>
<p>Except it wasn’t that easy, and it took a lot of work to get to that point. It was certainly easy to add the billing functionality, and a few small features to the product, but that would not have been possible if not for the hundreds of hours already invested into the project, as well as the countless contributions from others. Let’s step back and talk a little bit about that, about how Sentry had <strong>product-market-fit from day one</strong>.</p>
<p>If you did the Math, you’ll note Sentry existed for about five years before we launched the cloud service. That was half a decade of natural needs-driven growth, either the needs of myself or the company I worked at, or the needs of others, users or contributors, who were running their own copy of Sentry at their own jobs. It’s often hard to understate how valuable this period of time was for Sentry, but I don’t think its as important <em>how much</em> time it was, but the way it was spent and the environment surrounding it. It was a passion for solving our own problems, compounded through peer validation. That validation often came through conversations at conferences, on GitHub, or on IRC. If you opened a ticket on the Sentry project you rarely waited long on triage and frequently new ideas or fixes were implemented the same day. I personally found a lot of satisfaction in that, but more importantly I believe it helped accelerate a product that was already solving real world needs, and build the trust thats so important in developer tools.</p>
<p>This is what I find somewhat difficult to translate to folks. One of the biggest challenges of a company is finding product-market fit, yet we had stumbled into it. So how do you replicate that? I don’t have an answer, but I genuinely believe that you are your own best customer. So when asked, I try to come up with the best advice I can, even if we didn’t directly face the same challenges. The advice I give folks is the best thing you can do is to find customers - yourself or others - that share the same desired outcome that you’re passionate about. In my case it was all about fixing the bugs I continuously created, and with less frustration. We found customers who understood that, and validated our ideas off of them. We did <em>not</em> however, listen to potential customers who wanted something that we disagreed with. I talk a little bit about this in <a href="https://cra.mr/optimizing-for-taste">Optimizing for Taste</a>, but I thoroughly believe the best path you have to building a lasting product is by building something you’re passionate about, and have a strong thesis around.</p>
<p>I actually think this phase of building Sentry the most fulfilling, and the least demanding. Once we spun up the cloud service it meant being on-call (2x the pain when you’re also on call at your day job), having real customers to support, and dealing with all the backoffice involved in generating revenue. That, however, is a story for next time.</p>
<p>If you liked this article, I’d appreciate a share. Feel free to also reach out on (ugh) X, I’m <a href="https://x.com/zeeg">@zeeg</a>. I’d especially be interested if there’s something you found helpful, or something you’d like to hear more about. I’ll probably write about our approach to pricing and packaging next, as its something I’ve become very passionate about over the years, and is particularly interesting due to how few companies there are like us in the IT space.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>
<i>
<time datetime="2023-11-01">

</i>
</p>
<p>Bear Blog has a few design constraints for speed, efficiency, and stability. There are many great open-source, privacy-focussed analytics platforms out there, but I wanted to build one native to Bear.</p>
<p><a href="#tldr">tldr;</a></p>
<p>One of my constraints for Bear is to not use client-side javascript. This applies to the analytics system as well. Client-side javascript can be tweaked to determine the authenticity of traffic to a page and determine (partially) whether it is bot traffic or not, which is very useful for analytics. The main downside, however, is that most adblockers block analytics scripts. And not just the bad ones, like Google Analytics. Even Fathom and Plausible analytics struggle with logging activity on adblocked browsers.</p>
<p>There's always the option of just parsing server logs, which gives a rough indication of the kinds of traffic accessing the server. Unfortunately all server traffic is generally seen as equal. Technically bots "should" have a user-agent that identifies them as a bot, but few identify that since they're trying to scrape information as a "person" using a browser. In essence, just using server logs for analytics gives a skewed perspective to traffic since a lot of it are search-engine crawlers and scrapers (and now GPT-based parsers).</p>
<p>So instead of using server logs, I trigger a read with CSS. Here's my slightly boutique analytics system.</p>
<p>When a person accesses the website the page is loaded.
On each page I have the following CSS:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>body</span><span>:</span><span>hover</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>border</span><span>-</span><span>image</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>url</span><span>(</span><span>"/hit/{{ post.id }}/?ref={{ request.META.HTTP_REFERER }}"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The only info I need to actively re-add to this request is the referrer (yes, HTTP_REFERER is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer" target="_blank">spelt incorrectly</a>).</p>
<p>Now, when a person hovers their cursor over the page (or scrolls on mobile) it triggers <code>body:hover</code> which calls the URL for the post hit. I don't think any bots hover and instead just use JS to interact with the page, so I can, with reasonable certainty, assume that this is a human reader.</p>
<p>I then confirm the user-agent isn't a bot (which isn't perfect, but still something). I also extract the browser and platform from the user-agent string.</p>
<p>My second constraint is to not store any identifying information about the reader either in browser cookies, or on the server. In order to do this I use the IP address of the request to determine the country, then hash the IP address along with the date. All subsequent requests to the page are checked for matching IP address + date hashes and duplicates are discarded.</p>
<p>In this way each IP address per day constitutes one "read" of the page. No IP addresses are stored un-hashed and the IP-with-date-hash creates a convenient built-in expiry time.</p>
<p>Here's the code if you're interested:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>user_agent</span> <span>=</span> <span>httpagentparser</span><span>.</span><span>detect</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>request</span><span>.</span><span>META</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'HTTP_USER_AGENT'</span><span>,</span> <span>None</span><span>))</span>
<span>if</span> <span>user_agent</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'bot'</span><span>,</span> <span>False</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'Bot traffic'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span>

<span>ip_hash</span> <span>=</span> <span>hashlib</span><span>.</span><span>md5</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>client_ip</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>request</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>-</span><span>{</span><span>timezone</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>date</span><span>()</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>encode</span><span>(</span><span>'utf-8'</span><span>))</span><span>.</span><span>hexdigest</span><span>()</span>

<span>referrer</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>request</span><span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'ref'</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>)</span>
<span>if</span> <span>referrer</span><span>:</span>
    <span>referrer</span> <span>=</span> <span>urlparse</span><span>(</span><span>referrer</span><span>)</span>
    <span>referrer</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>{uri.scheme}</span><span>://</span><span>{uri.netloc}</span><span>/'</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>uri</span><span>=</span><span>referrer</span><span>)</span>

<span>Hit</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>get_or_create</span><span>(</span>
    <span>post_id</span><span>=</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>pk</span><span>,</span>
    <span>ip_address</span><span>=</span><span>ip_hash</span><span>,</span>
    <span>referrer</span><span>=</span><span>referrer</span><span>,</span>
    <span>country</span><span>=</span><span>country</span><span>,</span>
    <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>device</span><span>,</span>
    <span>browser</span><span>=</span><span>browser</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The only downside to this method is if there are multiple reads from the same IP address but on separate devices, it will still only be seen as one read. And I'm okay with that since it constitutes such a minor fragment of traffic. This provides an accurate count of reads and I feel is more concise and simpler than many other forms of analytics capture.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">tldr;</h2>
<p>I use CSS to trigger a url analytics endpoint on <code>body:hover</code>, determine useful information from the IP address and user-agent, then hash the IP address with the date to create a unique "read" of a page.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
        

        

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Sweet merciful Jesus, I woke up this morning and my inbox was flooded with horrific stories about how employers treat people. I knew things were fucked, but this was <em>so</em> much worse than I imagined, and that's not even getting into the comments on Hackernews. I am going to dig into some of those emails, but first...</p>
<p>I usually don't waste time on the negative comments because <em>usually</em> the person making it has obviously gulped down so much corporate Kool-aid that I am afraid they will projectile vomit Agile terminology all over me, but there was <em>one</em> that was so funny that I had to share it.</p>
<p><a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-accidentally-saved-half-a-million-dollars/">With regards to my post on saving half a million dollars</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a high likelihood that many other people in the org were lightyears ahead of the author. It's even more likely that an engineer or manager in their group was "Banking" the inefficiencies to use during a cost-cutting period - and the author ruined that chance... which will inevitably cause massive suffering and possibly poor performance reviews when there is nothing to trim."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My brother in Christ, I have a blog that is largely about corporate dysfunction and the soul-cost it imposes on well-meaning engineers, and you think that <em>I'm the problem because someone else was deliberately wasting money so that they could pretend to save it later</em>? In the words of the late Hitchens, "Do you see what brain rot descends on people?"</p>
<p>Incidentally that wasn't what was happening here, they really just never checked the database defaults. I'm sure someone is out there by 5-dimensional hyper-chess by deliberately going over the budget by a billion percent, but rest assured that this is not the simplest explanation. The whole idea that management must have a reason to do something this stupid is something I toyed with for a while, but it really only applies to the minority of cases.</p>
<h2 id="i-were-just-wasting-like-30-90-of-all-technical-productivity">I. We're Just Wasting Like 30-90% Of All Technical Productivity</h2>
<p>I am near <em>absolutely</em> convinced that the vast majority of our species' ability to produce things of value for the human race is just utterly squandered at large companies. I suspected we were wasting about 50%, but the volume of stories I got, frequently from <em>serious</em> companies, including some of the FAANG places that mere normal engineers like me look up at in awe while we worship at the altar of StackOverflow, just blew my mind. A lot of them involved doing variations of almost exactly what I did in different stacks, and every single time management just buried what happened.</p>
<p>If you recognize yourself in these emails but didn't give me permission to write an email, then it <em>isn't actually you</em>, it turns out these stories are so similar that they really do sound the same.</p>
<p>I received:</p>
<ol>
<li>A few stories about idling EC2 instances, totaling a total of about $4,000,000 saved <em>per month</em>, which management buried to avoid looking bad.</li>
<li>Another guy that discovered the same optimisations I made, with the same result from management.</li>
<li>Some security guys that just... I don't even know what to say about these stories, but <em>quite a few</em> stories were about finding out that a large proportion of a company's servers were infected with malware or mining cryptocurrency, which management, guess what, buried.</li>
<li>A guy, whose story deserves a whole post on its own, involving being told he's "not a team player" because he didn't stop someone else from flooding a server with crypto-bots.</li>
<li>Some people discovering other multi-million dollar optimisations that were ignored because they didn't have admin credentials, so they had to write suggestions which were ignored.</li>
</ol>
<p>There were some others, with a handful <em>genuinely</em> seeming to possibly add up to <em>billions</em> of dollars saved industry-wide, but the largest payout anyone ever received in the emails was $5K. Sampling bias, yadda yadda, listen, I'm pretty sure things are just fucked up.</p>
<p>The best story, which I have verified is true beyond all reasonable doubt, involved <em>literally saving a colleague's life with immense personal effort and in traumatic circumstances</em>, which was rewarded by <em>not</em> getting the rest of the day off and $50.</p>
<p>Like what the fuck is going on out there? I mean, I guess we already <em>know</em> what's going on out there - keeping a large company efficient is actually an unsolvable problem. I suspect that if you want to build a modern GPU, you just have to be able to sustain all that inefficiency or... you don't get to have anything that takes more than 50 people (or something in that range) to make. It's just all so much worse than I thought.</p>
<p>In fact, while a lot of those stories were bad, most of them <em>probably weren't the worst places</em> because most of the readers here are actually super talented engineers, which was evident from their excellent writing skills, open source contributions, and rugged good looks. The worst places <em>wouldn't have any talented engineers</em>. Like, Christ, let that sink in. It's like thinking you're in Hell with a few other people, desperately hanging on, then realizing that just in the next room is Super Hell which consists entirely of demons torturing each other. </p>
<p>Ack, it makes my skin crawl just thinking about it. There's a team out there where the main drama isn't one right faction and one wrong faction, there are <em>two factions fighting to the death over how best to use a spreadsheet as a database for a production application</em>. I feel like this has to be stopped but I don't have the strength.</p>
<p>It is fucking <em>awful</em> out there. Maybe we should set up a support group.</p>
<h2 id="ii-the-other-side">II. The Other Side</h2>
<p>The other thing I wanted to highlight is that there were <em>three</em> kinds of respondents, both via email and on Hackernews.</p>
<p>The first type, <a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/compliments/">my favourite commenters</a>, whose grim-faced no-nonsense corporate visages grace standups across the world. Thanks to their fearless leadership and keen business sense, I have it on good authority that all projects are scheduled to move from red status to green status despite all those risks unfortunately materializing, which is no one's fault in particular. Despite the various challenges we have faced over the years and lack of forward progress, I think <em>this</em> retro is the one where things are going to change.</p>
<p>The second type, the vast majority, who read this stuff and immediately suffer flashbacks. My heart goes out to you, my kin. As a few people wrote in, don't let the bastards grind you down.</p>
<p>And the mythical third type, who <em>aren't sure whether my stories are real</em>. Like, they just <em>assume</em> that I must be making stuff up, because how could <em>anyone</em> do their work so ineffectively? God, I wish I was them. I read stories similar to mine and can just tell that they're true. I really, really wish I couldn't - if only I could toggle my brain back to that sweet pre-employment state, where I knew there would be some minor inefficiencies and I'd have a great time tackling them. Before I realized that wasting ten years of someone's career on a task that doesn't need to be done is actually a rounding error for many companies, <em>and</em> that some absolute clowns would spend all their time trying to gaslight their peers into believing the work was accomplishing anything.</p>
<p>Some of the third type are obviously actually also working at really stupid companies, but just accept the social fiction. It's probably good for them. However many of the others <em>actually work somewhere functional</em>, and their experience is so far divorced from the average engineer's that I only have <em>one</em> friend that has worked at both a good and a bad place - and I keep a <em>lot</em> of friends in the tech space between being pretty extroverted and this blog.</p>
<p>There's just some massive unwashed mass of utterly stupid companies where nothing makes any sense, and the only efficiencies exist in the department that generates the money to fund the other stupid stuff, and then a few places doing things <em>halfway</em> right. The places doing things right tend to be characterized by being small, <em>not</em> being obsessed with growth, and having calm, compassionate founders who still keep a hand on the wheel. And the people that work there <em>tend not to know the people that work elsewhere</em>. They're just in some blessed bubble where the dysfunction still exists in serious quantities, but that quantity is like 1/10th the intensity of what it is elsewhere.</p>
<p>However, it's really hard to tell these people apart.</p>
<p>Anyway, what I'm saying is, hold out hope. I'm aiming to keep a few conversations going with people via email that have made the jump, and I'm hoping to write up a guide on how to most effectively follow suit. If I can help even a handful of readers connect with like-minded peers and escape their hellish office settings, that would be enough good to last me a lifetime.</p>
<p><em>Plus</em> then I can probably do some corporate backstabbing and stay karma-positive. Take me to management, baby, I want to buy an expensive hammock.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/68350.html">https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/68350.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38095276">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>"Why does ACPI exist" - - the greatest thread in the history of forums, locked by a moderator after 12,239 pages of heated debate, wait no let me start again.</p><p>Why does ACPI exist? In the beforetimes power management on x86 was done by jumping to an opaque BIOS entry point and hoping it would do the right thing. It frequently didn't. We called this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Power_Management">Advanced Power Management</a> (Advanced because before this power management involved custom drivers for every machine and everyone agreed that this was a bad idea), and it involved the firmware having to save and restore the state of every piece of hardware in the system. This meant that assumptions about hardware configuration were baked into the firmware - failed to program your graphics card exactly the way the BIOS expected? Hurrah! It's only saved and restored a subset of the state that you configured and now potential data corruption for you. The developers of ACPI made the reasonable decision that, well, maybe since the OS was the one setting state in the first place, the OS should restore it.</p><p>So far so good. But some state is fundamentally device specific, at a level that the OS generally ignores. How should this state be managed? One way to do that would be to have the OS know about the device specific details. Unfortunately that means you can't ship the computer without having OS support for it, which means having OS support for every device (exactly what we'd got away from with APM). This, uh, was not an option the PC industry seriously considered. The alternative is that you ship something that abstracts the details of the specific hardware and makes that abstraction available to the OS. This is what ACPI does, and it's also what things like Device Tree do. Both provide static information about how the platform is configured, which can then be consumed by the OS and avoid needing device-specific drivers or configuration to be built-in.</p><p>The main distinction between Device Tree and ACPI is that Device Tree is purely a description of the hardware that exists, and so still requires the OS to know what's possible - if you add a new type of power controller, for instance, you need to add a driver for that to the OS before you can express that via Device Tree. ACPI decided to include an interpreted language to allow vendors to expose functionality to the OS without the OS needing to know about the underlying hardware. So, for instance, ACPI allows you to associate a device with a function to power down that device. That function may, when executed, trigger a bunch of register accesses to a piece of hardware otherwise not exposed to the OS, and that hardware may then cut the power rail to the device to power it down entirely. And that can be done without the OS having to know anything about the control hardware.</p><p>How is this better than just calling into the firmware to do it? Because the fact that ACPI declares that it's going to access these registers means the OS can figure out that it shouldn't, because it might otherwise collide with what the firmware is doing. With APM we had no visibility into that - if the OS tried to touch the hardware at the same time APM did, boom, almost impossible to debug failures (This is why various hardware monitoring drivers refuse to load by default on Linux - the firmware declares that it's going to touch those registers itself, so Linux decides not to in order to avoid race conditions and potential hardware damage. In many cases the firmware offers a collaborative interface to obtain the same data, and a driver can be written to get that. <a href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204807#c37">this bug comment</a> discusses this for a specific board)</p><p>Unfortunately ACPI doesn't entirely remove opaque firmware from the equation - ACPI methods can still trigger System Management Mode, which is basically a fancy way to say "Your computer stops running your OS, does something else for a while, and you have no idea what". This has all the same issues that APM did, in that if the hardware isn't in exactly the state the firmware expects, bad things can happen. While historically there were a bunch of ACPI-related issues because the spec didn't define every single possible scenario and also there was no conformance suite (eg, should the interpreter be multi-threaded? Not defined by spec, but influences whether a specific implementation will work or not!), these days overall compatibility is pretty solid and the vast majority of systems work just fine - but we do still have some issues that are largely associated with System Management Mode.</p><p>One example is a <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220429030501.1909-3-mario.limonciello@amd.com/">recent Lenovo one</a>, where the firmware appears to try to poke the NVME drive on resume. There's some indication that this is intended to deal with transparently unlocking self-encrypting drives on resume, but it seems to do so without taking IOMMU configuration into account and so things explode. It's kind of understandable why a vendor would implement something like this, but it's also kind of understandable that doing so without OS cooperation may end badly.</p><p>This isn't something that ACPI enabled - in the absence of ACPI firmware vendors would just be doing this unilaterally with even less OS involvement and we'd probably have even more of these issues. Ideally we'd "simply" have hardware that didn't support transitioning back to opaque code, but we don't (ARM has basically the same issue with TrustZone). In the absence of the ideal world, by and large ACPI has been a net improvement in Linux compatibility on x86 systems. It certainly didn't remove the "Everything is Windows" mentality that many vendors have, but it meant we largely only needed to ensure that Linux behaved the same way as Windows in a finite number of ways (ie, the behaviour of the ACPI interpreter) rather than in every single hardware driver, and so the chances that a new machine will work out of the box are much greater than they were in the pre-ACPI period.</p><p>There's an alternative universe where we decided to teach the kernel about every piece of hardware it should run on. Fortunately (or, well, unfortunately) we've seen that in the ARM world. Most device-specific simply never reaches mainline, and most users are stuck running ancient kernels as a result. Imagine every x86 device vendor shipping their own kernel optimised for their hardware, and now imagine how well that works out given the quality of their firmware. Does that really seem better to you?</p><p>It's understandable why ACPI has a poor reputation. But it's also hard to figure out what would work better in the real world. We could have built something similar on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Firmware">Open Firmware</a> instead but the distinction wouldn't be terribly meaningful - we'd just have Forth instead of the ACPI bytecode language. Longing for a non-ACPI world without presenting something that's better and actually stands a reasonable chance of adoption doesn't make the world a better place.</p></div></div>]]></description>

There were several reasons for my decision but it mainly boiled down to me turning 30 this year, having an existential crisis questioning wtf I’m doing with my life and ultimately, realising I wasn’t having fun programming professionally anymore. I concluded that I needed some time away to fall back <em>“in love”</em> with programming, as a hobby with no financial strings attached to it. Obviously, I recognise this is an incredibly privileged thing to do, not working is something that many people can only dream of.</p><p id="9f97">So here I am, in my PJs after waking up at 12pm on a Tuesday, reflecting on my time working as a <em>“professional”</em> programmer, a career I’ve largely fallen into by accident.</p><h2 id="a992">Backstory</h2><p id="5883">I was never one of those kids that got into programming at 10 yrs old. When I was 10 I was at the cage in the estate next to my nan’s house shouting <em>”top bins!”</em> as I did my best Bend it Like Beckham impression (I’m still bitter I could never get the spiky hair going). Throughout my school life my main guiding heuristic was fun, I only ever did things I enjoyed. So when the time came to pick a degree I chose psychology because the syllabus looked cool and I’ve always found humans pretty interesting. Its funny, as I’ve gotten more experience as a developer one of the things that stand out to me the most is that there are a lot more human problems than people realise in any given software project. Problems that cant simply be coded away, so understanding humans has been surprisingly useful.</p><p id="d6f3">I’ve always been an avid reader of blogs and online publications. While at uni I has subscriptions to Scientific American, Wired, Arch Daily and Dezeen (what can I say, I’m a cultured guy). Toward the end of my time at uni there was a lot of buzz around CRISPR and self-driving cars. It was around then that I heard of neural networks for the first time. I think the fact that I understood the underlying analogy of neural nets was really important in helping me get over the subconscious mental barrier that I couldn’t be involved in technology in any other way than as a consumer.</p><p id="d770">Anyways, as I got toward the end of my degree I could no longer ignore the <em>”What are you going to do with psychology?”</em> question. After sitting on the question for some time I (naively) figured the three most important areas in the working world I could have an impact on were: humans, finance and technology. I knew I didn’t want to become a therapist because I had already been unofficially doing that for my friends and family for a while and peoples problems are tiring af. I’d always disliked finance (and still do tbh) so the only option left was technology.</p><p id="239c">I remember the day I wrote my fist line of code, it was 2nd of Jan 2016. I was 2 months away from 23. I started the day full of optimism and tried the python course on CodeAcademy (it was still free back then) and literally everything went over my head. I couldn’t grasp any of it. I remember feeling like an idiot for even thinking I could do this at 23. The failure confirmed the stereotypes I’d seen on TV, that if you didn’t start writing code at 10, then this wasn’t for you. Just as I was about to give up I decided to try CodeAcademy’s HTLM&amp;CSS course. To my surprise, I managed to whizz through it and firmly understood the material. I genuinely think if I hadn’t done that course I might have become an investment banker or something 🤢.</p><p id="49bf">Fast forward two years, an internship at AKQA, a shitty SWE job at a shitty startup, and then I got the offer to join the team I have just left. The best description of our role in the company is probably what AWS is to Amazon, the team manages the company’s internal infrastructure and data centre. Everything from procuring racks and servers; designing and implementing the data centres network topology; configuring servers and all the services that run on top (all the way up to JS for the interface used by other teams); configuring and running a bare metal Kubernetes (k8s) cluster and probably a lot more stuff that currently escapes my mind. It is a real diverse set of things to work on.</p><p id="b3ab">After exactly 5 yrs (to the day) with the team, I decided it was time to pack it all in for a bit. However, while the experiences are still fresh in my mind and I have some breathing space I want to go over the things I’ve learned and discovered in my journey from programmer training wheels to today, where I would describe myself as whatever the programming equivalent of puberty is.</p><h2 id="4ccc">Have an opinion</h2><p id="cca0">After my first year in the team, I remember asking one of our senior engineers for <strong><em>technical</em></strong> feedback. I asked him what I could do to improve. He told me a bunch of stuff but the one that stuck was,<em> ”have an opinion”</em>. Over the years I’ve thought about this a lot and I’ve come to the conclusion that having an opinion on a technical decision forces you to be able to justify that decision and to justify it you need a deeper understanding of that technology or choice.</p><p id="3ddb">I’ve always described SWEs as 15-year-old girls fighting over their favourite boy bands, jumping from one band to the next when something new and hot comes along. Having an opinion grounded in sound technical understanding can help calm that mental storm of feeling like you always need to keep up because you can either disagree with something based on evidence or can find connections between things based on your deeper understanding.</p><p id="51bd">I mean, he could have literally meant<em> ”fuck everyone, just bully your opinion onto people”</em> with no deeper meaning but this is how I’ve interpreted it. I guess you could say its just my opinion, innit.</p><h2 id="9aa0">Debugging is a science</h2><p id="13f7">Fast forward a few years and I was having some problems getting through tickets. Everything felt slow and laboured. I was struggling to get the last 10% of tickets working and over the line. I wasn’t really sure what to do and I guess others in the team picked up on it because our tech lead offered to take me for a coffee and some programmer therapy.</p><p id="bdf3">He asked me,<em> ”whats your approach to writing software?”</em>. At the time I remember thinking <em>”What do you mean bruv? The same as you obviously, I use a text editor.”</em>. I was a little confused by the question because I had never really thought about it. After some discussion we highlighted that my approach to writing code was akin to an artist throwing paint at a blank canvas, I tend to write what <strong><em>feels</em></strong> good. I also came to the realisation I didn’t really know how to debug code efficiently. I was fine debugging my own code but I would struggle to debug systems and components I was unfamiliar with. At the time a lot of my work was combining systems/components rather than writing fresh code myself, I was slightly out of my depth.</p><p id="6337">Debugging is a separate skill from writing code. It requires a different way of working and without deliberate practice, like anything, you won’t improve. Our tech lead told me, <em>”Writing code is creative, its like art. Debugging is like science, you need to formulate a small hypothesis and test it, then keep doing that till you’ve fixed the problem”</em>. That was incredibly eye-opening.</p><p id="29e4">Since that conversation, I’ve come to the conclusion that there are three main pillars of being a good software engineer: writing code, debugging code and reviewing code. We spend a lot of time focusing on and actively trying to improve the code-writing part but not so much on the other two. While I’m not a pair programming fanboy there are definitely times where its well worth sitting down and watching someone more experienced than you solve a problem, then comparing it to how you would do it and using that data to figure out how to improve. I would say that pair debugging and pair code review are just as important. You can speed run your personal development just by seeing what kind of questions the other person asks while reviewing and how they break down their debugging into testable chunks.</p><h2 id="299c">Pragmatic programming</h2><p id="2f56">Unlike my actual politics, I would describe my philosophy to software changes as <strong><em>small C</em></strong> conservative. I feel there needs to be a strong reason to make a drastic change to working code. Fundamentally, I believe giving your customers high-quality, working code trumps everything else. Customers really don’t care about how your team is collectively jerking off to memory-safe, perfectly functional code with no side effects. The end user doesn’t care if your code is readable, DRY, maintainable or spaghetti code. They care that the product works as intended and does so reliably.</p><p id="260c">As SWEs, I think we sometimes forget that. I would describe the team I just left’s approach to software delivery as pragmatic, working code trumps perfect code. It doesn’t matter if your code isn’t abstracted into a perfectly generic DSL, does that refactor need to happen? One of the things about gaining experience is you learn when to break the rules. You learn when its fine to copy and paste working code instead of trying to abstract it away, which then not only risks delaying that new feature or proof of concept but also risks breaking systems that we already know works well.</p><p id="65cd">I believe software gets complicated at the edges, at the points where systems interact with each other. Ensuring that the core of the system is as simple as possible to write, reason about and manage is the most important goal of any software project. I find saying <strong><em>no</em></strong> more often than saying <strong><em>yes</em></strong> makes reaching this target easier for everyone.</p><h2 id="31c9">You’re still a code parent even after you’ve merged and deployed</h2><p id="3b0c">Like everyone else, when the pandemic started we had a bunch of problems (other than the pandemic itself) transitioning from an in-office team to a remote team. During the first lockdown, we found ourselves in the office regularly doing maintenance and fixing fires. We’d always had monitoring but after this experience, we wanted to ramp up the observability of our systems.</p><p id="d79b">To hark back to my earlier point about human problems, throwing new tools at the problem is the easy part, the cultural change required for the tools to be useful is what’s actually hard. So we’ve just added tracing, that’s cool, now what?</p><p id="d3e8">You need to make sure your SWEs understand that they still have responsibilities even after their PR has been merged. They need to feel a sense of ownership over the entire system and lifecycle of a program/feature/change. Jenkins is broken? CI failed? We need to tweak the resources used by a service in our k8s cluster? It shouldn’t matter if a SWE mainly works on the frontend or backend or infrastructure, everyone should be able to jump in and fix the issue. It shouldn’t be any single persons responsibility, it should be <strong><em>our </em></strong>responsibility.</p><p id="f82e">Its this cultural change that necessitates the tooling. When SWEs realise its a pain to be consistently retroactive to fires instead of proactive to prevent the fire in the first place, they start thinking about the best ways to approach the problem. The solution and/or tooling is not important as long as it helps the team achieve their targets, its the collective desire of the team to ensure quality thats important.</p><h2 id="771a">Git — you’re doing it wrong (probably)</h2><p id="79c4">Although I said I’m a <strong><em>small C</em></strong> conservative, there are very few technology hills I’m willing to die on. After a convincing conversation, I’m happy to change my mind on most things, except git. Git is a hill I’m willing to die on.</p><p id="e11b">Every software team in the world has its own culture and ways of doing things, which is all good but when I see teams using git as a glorified <strong><em>`ctrl + s`</em></strong> it really breaks my heart.</p><p id="f524">This should be its own blog post (one I’m planning on writing) but these are some of my general issues with how I see teams use git. I apologise in advance for any hurt feelings but here goes…</p><p id="5c08">If you squash on merge, you’re doing it wrong. If you’ve never used git blame, you’re doing it wrong. If your repo’s history is useless, you’re doing it wrong. If you didn’t add a typo fix or white line change as a separate commit, you’re doing it wrong. If you’re commit message (when raising a PR) only consists of the words<em> ”fixup”</em> or a ticket number or a PR link, you’re doing it wrong. If you have a policy of one commit per PR, you’re doing it wrong. If you’re scared of a merge conflict, you’re doing it wrong.</p><p id="1278">In the time I’ve been working I’ve seen Jira projects change names, I’ve seen repos move from stash (bitbucket predecessor) to GitHub.com and then from GitHub.com to GitHub Enterprise. The only constant has been the <strong><em>`main`</em></strong> branch. As a tech company, as long as you’re in business the <strong><em>`main`</em></strong> branch will exist. Knowing that, it should be the single source of truth for your code base.</p><p id="551a">In my eyes, <strong><em>`main`</em></strong> has two main functions: firstly, it captures a moment in time. It shouldn’t redirect you to a ticket or PR, there is no guarantee either of those will exist. It should be self-encompassing. You shouldn’t try preserve history because I dont care about the journey or what discussions were had, all I care about is the final copy that got merged into <strong><em>`main`</em></strong>.</p><p id="ef4e">Secondly, its a forensic tool. You whip it out when something goes wrong and you need to go into NCIS mode. You should be able to meaningfully bisect <strong><em>`main` </em></strong>(read: without getting rid of whole features), you should be able to use <strong><em>`git blame`</em></strong> and be able to check the history of a line to see its accompanying changes. I dont wanna check the history of some line of code and see a whole heap of changes that have absolutely nothing to do with it because someone decided to fix a typo as part of some other work.</p><p id="1122">Your history should be clean and easily readable. Each commit should contain one logical change and ideally pass CI. If you dont know what that means its something that comes with experience but in a nutshell if you change some bit of code adding/removing/editing docs, comments and tests relevant to that change should all be a part of that commit. Nothing else, no typo fixes, no refactors, renaming another function etc, all of that should be separate commits. Your commit message should have a short title explaining the change and the body should go into as much detail as necessary into <strong><em>why</em></strong> the change took place, I can see the <strong><em>what</em></strong> from looking at the diff.</p><p id="1462">Ok, I’ll stop there before someone spontaneously combusts in flames of rage.</p><h2 id="5075">Hardware still matters</h2><p id="255c">We live in a world of abstractions. Whether its the cloud or the frameworks we use every day, we can sometimes forget that underneath it all everything is still running on physical computers somewhere.</p><p id="6794">Over the last five years, I’ve changed hard drives and SSDs; I added network cards to server chassis; I’ve diagnosed kernel panics on servers without BMC or IPMI interfaces by literally pushing in a trolley with a monitor and keyboard; I’ve installed device drivers for an array of weird devices; I’ve sat in hardware procure meetings; I’ve configured network switches; I’ve written kickstart files and configured `PXE` boots using MAC addresses; I’ve plugged ethernet cables in and out more times than I can count.</p><p id="408f">I may never again work in a team where I have a mental map of all the hardware we own or a team where <strong><em>`ssh`</em></strong> + <strong><em>`dmseg/journalctl`</em></strong> is the starting point of my debugging but the education I’ve had working on those systems will last me a lifetime. I’ve had a crash course in electrical engineering and computer science that I could have never gotten from any university in the world. I firmly believe its easier to go up the stack than it is to go down.</p><p id="0e64">In the outside world, there is a generation of people who only think in EC2s and AWS lambda’s and I dont blame them for that, its the world we live in. I just don’t believe that <strong><em>`ssh`</em></strong>-ing into a machine and digging around the file system using <strong><em>`vi`</em></strong> will ever not be a useful skill to have.</p><h2 id="8d4d">Being dumb is fun</h2><p id="1c7f">As I alluded to at the start of this post I’ve been playing both team and individual sports my whole life. One of the unique properties of sport is that you are viscerally aware of where you sit on the <strong><em>sucks</em></strong> -&gt; <strong><em>excellent</em></strong> spectrum. And if you are not sure someone will definitely let you know, whether its by running rings around you or literally shouting, <em>“Oi you’re fucking shit, go home”</em> across the field (true story, it’s happened to me). Inevitably, even if you’re a candidate with a realistic chance of going pro, at some point you’re going to suck.</p><p id="9d86">There are two ways you can deal with this: 1) actually go home and either leave the team or worse, leave the sport altogether, 2) suck it up and train harder so you can be the one telling people they’re shit. I’ve found that everyone who plays sports long enough is pretty competitive and doesn’t take criticism to heart in a way that people who haven’t sometimes do.</p><p id="c098">What’s this got to do with software engineering? I feel like there is a weird parallel, where there is a certain class of engineer, usually good at what they do and/or in positions of power, who are more than happy to tell you you’re shyte. They’re the type who don’t talk to you, they talk <strong><em>at</em></strong> you. The type who dont ever ask you questions in a conversation outside of <em>“What, you really dont know what X is??”</em>. The type who don’t explain things in an audience-appropriate manner, you either get it on their level or you dont.</p><p id="4323">As a normie, when I first met these types of engineers I didn’t know how to talk or deal with them. I’ve had engineers publically ask me, <em>“Did they not ask you what your favourite Linux distro is before they offered you the job?”</em> in a condescending tone when they discovered I didn’t know much about Linux. I’ve had engineers give me 101 comments on a PR starting with <em>“What the fuck is this…”</em> and ending with me coming in one morning to find the whole thing rewritten.</p><p id="7ac1">Over time I learned that while there are a bunch of them blowing hot smoke out their arses, there are also some who actually know what they’re talking about. The competitor in me always wants to improve so occasionally stroking their egos and making them feel like the smartest person in the room can lead to a lot of valuable and obscure bits of information that might have taken you months or years to discover by yourself. And in all honesty, it’s not that hard to do. It usually just involves you asking them a question and shutting the fuck up because as I said, they dont need more than themselves to carry a conversation.</p><p id="dbf3">I’ve also learnt that in any given team there are a lot more<em> me’s</em> than there are <em>them’s</em>. People who are confused but are too intimidated to ask questions or dont want to look stupid. As a result, I always pitch myself as the dumbest person in the room and ask all the stupid questions I can think of. Its beneficial for not only me but for others in the team too. Not everyone is comfortable playing this role or looking stupid in front of their peers but growing up being berated on a football pitch by your mate’s dad gives you some pretty thick skin.</p><h2 id="f07e">Fin</h2><p id="43d3">So that’s mostly what I can think of for now. It’ll be fun to come back in 7 yrs’ time to see what changed and what stayed the same in terms of my perspective on software engineering (if I’m still doing it), until then and in the wise words of Bill &amp; Ted, <em>“Be excellent to each other!”</em>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Distil-Whisper is trained on a <em>knowledge distillation</em> objective. Specifically, it is trained to minimise the KL divergence
between the distilled model and the Whisper model, as well as the cross-entropy loss on pseudo-labelled audio data.</p>
<p dir="auto">We train Distil-Whisper on a total of 22k hours of pseudo-labelled audio data, spanning 10 domains with over 18k speakers:</p>

</p>
<p dir="auto">This diverse audio dataset is paramount to ensuring robustness of Distil-Whisper to different datasets and domains.</p>
<p dir="auto">In addition, we use a WER filter to discard pseudo-labels where Whisper mis-transcribes or hallucinates. This greatly
improves WER performance of the downstream distilled model.</p>

<p>- Vi er veldig glade for at Personvernrådet er enige i Datatilsynets vurderinger og utvider forbudet vårt. Målet er at innbyggere over hele Europa vil få bedre personvern, sier direktør i Datatilsynet Line Coll.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Datatilsynet er svært bekymret for den ulovlige sporingen, overvåkingen og profileringen som skjer på Facebook og Instagram. Selv om det lenge har vært klart at Meta bryter loven, og på tross av Datatilsynets forbud i Norge, fortsetter Meta med sin ulovlig behandling av personopplysninger. Dette er grunnen til at vi har valgt å løfte saken til Personvernrådet (EDPB), som nå har sagt seg enige i at det haster med et permanent forbud mot de ulovlige aktivitetene på europeisk nivå.</p>
<p>Facebook og Instagram har over 250 millioner aktive brukere i EU/EØS.</p>
<p>Personvernrådets vedtak er en instruks til det irske datatilsynet om å nedlegge et permanent forbud ovenfor Metas europeiske hovedkontor i Irland. Når dette har skjedd vil forbudet begynne å gjelde.</p>
<p>- Nok er nok. Etter over fem år med krenkelse av brukernes grunnleggende personvern, setter Personvernrådet nå ned foten mot Metas manglende respekt for loven, sier leder for internasjonal seksjon, Tobias Judin.</p>
<p>Meta har&nbsp;fått klar beskjed om at forretningsmodellen deres og bruken av personopplysninger strider med det europeiske personvernregelverket. De har sagt at de vil be brukerne om samtykke til å bruke dataene deres til adferdsbasert markedsføring i fremtiden. Selskapet har imidlertid ikke innført noen konkrete endringer ennå, og dermed fortsetter de ulovlige aktivitetene fortløpende.</p>
<p>Datatilsynet er dessuten i sterk tvil om Metas foreslåtte samtykkeløsning,&nbsp;som innebærer at de som ikke samtykker til adferdsbasert markedsføring må betale en avgift, vil være lovlig. Personvernrådets avgjørelse er derfor viktig for å unngå at&nbsp;Metas lovbrudd fortsetter mens selskapet leter etter en lovlig måte å innrette seg på.&nbsp;</p>

<div><p>The graceful winding arms of the grand-design spiral galaxy M51 stretch across this image from the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope. Unlike the menagerie of weird and wonderful spiral galaxies with ragged or disrupted spiral arms, grand-design spiral galaxies boast prominent, well-developed spiral arms like the ones showcased in this image. This galactic portrait is a composite image that integrates data from Webb’s <a href="https://esawebb.org/about/instruments/nircam-niriss/">Near-InfraRed Camera</a> (NIRCam) and <a href="https://esawebb.org/about/instruments/miri/">Mid-InfraRed Instrument</a> (MIRI).</p><p>In this image the dark red regions trace the filamentary warm dust permeating the medium of the galaxy. The red regions show the reprocessed light from complex molecules forming on dust grains, while colours of orange and yellow reveal the regions of ionised gas by the recently formed star clusters. Stellar feedback has a dramatic effect on the medium of the galaxy and create complex network of bright knots as well as cavernous black bubbles.</p></div>
<p>M51 — also known as NGC 5194 — lies about 27 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Canes Venatici, and is trapped in a tumultuous relationship with its near neighbour, the dwarf galaxy NGC 5195. The interaction between these two galaxies has made these galactic neighbours one of the better-studied galaxy pairs in the night sky. The gravitational influence of M51’s smaller companion is thought to be partially responsible for the stately nature of the galaxy’s prominent and distinct spiral arms. If you would like to learn more about this squabbling pair of galactic neighbours, you can explore earlier observations of M51 by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope <a href="https://esahubble.org/images/heic0506a/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Webb observation of M51 is one of a series of observations collectively titled Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers, or <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=1783">FEAST</a>. The FEAST observations were designed to shed light on the interplay between stellar feedback and star formation in environments outside of our own galaxy, the Milky Way. Stellar feedback is the term used to describe the outpouring of energy from stars into the environments which form them, and is a crucial process in determining the rates at which stars form. Understanding stellar feedback is vital to building accurate universal models of star formation.</p>
<p>The aim of the FEAST observations is to discover and study stellar nurseries in galaxies beyond our own Milky Way. Before Webb became operative, other observatories such as the Atacama Large Millimetre Array in the Chilean desert and Hubble have given us a glimpse of star formation either at the onset (tracing the dense gas and dust clouds where stars will form) or after the stars have destroyed with their energy their natal gas and dust clouds. Webb is opening a new window into the early stages of star formation and stellar light, as well as the energy reprocessing of gas and dust. Scientists are seeing star clusters emerging from their natal cloud in galaxies beyond our local group for the first time. They will also be able to measure how long it takes for these stars to pollute with newly formed metals and to clean out the gas (these time scales are different from galaxy to galaxy). By studying these processes, we will better understand how the star formation cycle and metal enrichment are regulated within galaxies as well as what are the time scales for planets and brown dwarfs to form. Once dust and gas is removed from the newly formed stars, there is no material left to form planets.</p>
<p>[<em>Image Description:</em> A large spiral galaxy takes up the entirety of the image. The core is mostly bright white, but there are also swirling, detailed structures that resemble water circling a drain. There is white and pale blue light that emanates from stars and dust at the core’s centre, but it is tightly limited to the core. The rings feature colours of deep red and orange and highlight filaments of dust around cavernous black bubbles.]</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
<div>
    <h2 id="faq">Frequently asked questions</h2>
    
<h2 id="what-is-openrw">What is OpenRW</h2>
<p>OpenRW is an open-source game engine that attempts to re-implement the engine used in the classic video game Grand Theft Auto III (GTA III), first released in 2001. With the purpose of enabling better compatibility with modern systems and ensuring that it remains possible to play the game in the future.</p>

<p>The primary goal of the project is to reach “Version 1.0”, this would mean:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fully implementing the original gameplay</li>
  <li>Compatible with all data formats used in the game</li>
  <li>Compatible with modern gamepads where possible</li>
  <li>Able to load save game files from the game</li>
  <li>Run with community made mods that only change game data</li>
  <li>Run natively on Windows, Linux and macOS</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenRW would not aim for Version 1.0 to re-create any obvious bugs such as crashes or situations where the game becomes impossible to progress.</p>

<p>Other features, which would not be needed for Version 1.0 include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enhanced support for user modification</li>
  <li>Changes to the gameplay</li>
  <li>Multiplayer</li>
</ul>

<p>Features like these will not be accepted into OpenRW at present, as these don’t contribute to the primary goal. Once Version 1.0 has been reached a “new” version of OpenRW may be forked that contains these kinds of features.</p>

<h2 id="do-i-need-gta-iii-to-play-openrw">Do I need GTA III to play OpenRW?</h2>
<p>In short: Yes.</p>

<p>OpenRW is simply a game engine that is compatible with the original game, it has no assets of its own. In order to play GTA III using  OpenRW you must own the game and have the data installed on your system. If you need a copy of the game it’s available on <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/12100/">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>It is theoretically possible to develop a completely new game, without any of the assets or content from GTA III, however no such project is currently under way.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-play-openrw-now">Can I play OpenRW now?</h2>
<p>In its current state it is not possible to complete the game using OpenRW, or make any significant progress through the game. There are many bugs that need to be fixed and features that need to be developed before it becomes possible to play anything with OpenRW. The latest version of OpenRW will always be available from the source code <a href="https://github.com/rwengine/openrw">repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-play-openrw-on-my-macos--linux-computer">Can I play OpenRW on my macOS / Linux computer?</h2>
<p>Yes. OpenRW runs on macOS and Linux, as well as some BSDs.</p>

<h2 id="why-make-openrw">Why make OpenRW?</h2>
<p>Beyond technical curiosity, OpenRW exists to conserve the game and ensure it is playable into the future by improving compatibility with modern systems and allowing future developers to make the engine compatible with whatever systems may exist in the future.</p>

<p>In addition to conservation it may also offer a platform for others to build 3D action games in the future.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-contribute-to-openrw">Can I contribute to OpenRW?</h2>
<p>Yes, development of OpenRW is open, you can follow along and contribute via the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/rwengine/openrw">project page</a>. Also drop into the IRC channel, <code>#openrw</code> @ <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#openrw">irc.libera.chat</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-licence-is-openrw-released-under">What licence is OpenRW released under</h2>
<p>The OpenRW engine is released under the GNU General Public License Version 3.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-working-on-openrw">Who is working on OpenRW?</h2>
<p>The project is developed in an open and collaborative manner, anyone who wishes to contribute code or documentation is able to send changes via a pull request to the github <a href="https://github.com/rwengine/openrw">repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id="will-it-be-possible-to-play-vice-city-with-openrw">Will it be possible to play Vice City with OpenRW?</h2>
<p>The current priority of the project is to implement support for playing GTA III. Once this is completed it will be clear how much extra work will be required to fully support Vice City in addition to III. The work may need to be done in a fork of OpenRW dedicated to Vice CIty, or it may be unfeasible for one reason or another.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-story">What is the story?</h2>
<p>Development on OpenRW was started by tsjost and danhedron in 2013,  where it began as a simple model viewer that became a map viewer. Over time OpenRW has gained new features such as physics, vehicles and pedestrians, and a script machine that make more of the game accessible via the OpenRW engine. Now it is possible to start a new game or load a save game within OpenRW and interact with the world.
At present, development is performed in the open where anyone is free to contribute to the project via the github repository.</p>

			<p><em>25 December 2016</em></p>

			<p>Data outlives code, and a valuable database supports many applications over time. These ten rules will help grow your database schema without breaking your applications.<br></p><p><a href="https://blog.datomic.com/images/blog/-53l7suMbyss/WDw4_QYOk5I/AAAAAAAAANQ/MmACZ8DAbKsE8tE4BzI4I6Y81tt18aJtwCPcB/s1600/DatomicLogo_Square.png" imageanchor="1"><img height="199" src="https://blog.datomic.com/images/blog/-53l7suMbyss/WDw4_QYOk5I/AAAAAAAAANQ/MmACZ8DAbKsE8tE4BzI4I6Y81tt18aJtwCPcB/s200/DatomicLogo_Square.png" width="200"></a></p><h3>1. &nbsp;Prod is not like dev.</h3><p>Production is not development. In production, one or more codebases depend on your data, and these ten rules below should be followed exactingly.</p><p>A dev environment can be much more relaxed. &nbsp;Alone on your development machine experimenting with a new feature, you have no users to break. &nbsp;You can soften the rules, so long as you harden them when transitioning to production.</p><h3>2. &nbsp;Grow your schema, and never break it.</h3><p>The lack of common vocabulary makes it all too easy to automate the wrong practices. I will use the terms <i>growth</i> and <i>breakage</i> as defined in Rich Hickey's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk" target="_blank">Spec-ulation</a>&nbsp;talk. &nbsp;In schema terms:</p><ul><li><i>growth</i> is providing more schema</li><li><i>breakage</i> is removing schema, or changing the meaning of existing schema.</li></ul><p>In contrast to these terms, many people use "<a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html" target="_blank">migrations</a>", "<a href="http://databaserefactoring.com/" target="_blank">refactoring</a>", or "<a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html" target="_blank">evolution</a>". These usages tend to focus on repeatability, convenience, and the needs of new programs, ignoring the distinction between growth and breakage. The problem here is obvious: Breakage is bad, so we don't want it to be more convenient!</p><p>Using precise language underscores the costs of of breakage. Most migrations are easily categorized as growth or breakage by considering the rules below. &nbsp;<i>Growth migrations</i> are suitable for production, and <i>breakage migrations</i> are, at best, a dev-only convenience. Keep them widely separate.</p><h3>3. The database is the source of truth.</h3><p>Schema growth needs to be reproducible from one environment to another. &nbsp;Reproducibility supports the development and testing of new schema before putting it into production and also the reuse of schema in different databases. Schema growth also needs to be evident in the database itself, so that you can determine what the database has, what it needs, and when growth occurred.</p><p>For both of these reasons, the database is the proper source of truth for schema growth. When the database is the source of truth, reproducability and auditability happen <i>for free</i>&nbsp;via the ordinary<br>query and transaction capabilities of the database. &nbsp;(If your database is not up to the tasks of queries and transactions you have bigger problems beyond the scope of this article).</p><p>Storing schema in a database is strictly more powerful than storing schema as text files in source control. The database is the actual home for schema, plus it provides validation, structure, query, transactions, and history. A source control system provides only history and is separate from the data itself.</p><p>Note that this does <i>not</i> mean "never put schema information in source control". Source control may be convenient for other reasons, e.g. it may be more readily accessible. You may redundantly store schema in source control, but remember that the database is definitive.</p><h3>4. &nbsp;Growing is adding.</h3><p>As you acquire more information about your domain, grow your schema to match. You can grow a schema by adding new things, and <i>only</i> by adding new things, for example:</p><ul><li>adding new attributes to an existing 'type'</li><li>adding new types</li><li>adding relationships between types</li></ul><h3>5. &nbsp;Never remove a name.</h3><p>Removing a named schema component at any level is a breaking change for programs that depend on that name. Never remove a name.</p><h3>6. &nbsp;Never reuse a name.</h3><p>The meaning of a name is established when the name is first introduced. Reusing that name to mean something substantially different breaks programs that depend on that meaning. This can be even<br>worse than removing the name, as the breakage may not be as immediately obvious.</p><h3>7. &nbsp;Use aliases.</h3><p>If you are familiar with database refactoring patterns, the advice in Rules Five and Six may seem stark. After all, one purpose of refactoring is to adopt better names as we discover them. How can we<br>do that if names can never be removed or changed in meaning?</p><p>The simple solution is to use <a href="http://docs.datomic.com/schema.html#renaming-an-identity" target="_blank">more than one alias</a> to refer to the same schema entity. Consider the following example:</p><ul><li>In iteration 1, users of your system are identified by their email with an attribute named <span><b>:user/id</b></span>.&nbsp;</li><li>In iteration 2, you discover that users sometimes have non-email identifiers for users and that you want to store a user's email even when not using the email as an identifier. In short, you wish that <span><b>:user/id</b></span>&nbsp;was named <span><b>:user/primary-email</b></span>.</li></ul><p>No problem! Just create <span><b>:user/primary-email</b></span> as an alias for <span><b>:user/id</b></span>. Older programs can continue to use <span><b>:user/id</b></span>, and newer programs can use the now-preferred <span><b>:user/primary-email</b></span>.</p><h3>8. &nbsp;Namespace all names.</h3><p>Namespaces greatly reduce the cost of getting a name wrong, as the same local name can safely have different meanings in different namespaces. &nbsp;Continuing the previous example, imagine that the local<br>name <span><b>id</b></span> is used to refer to a UUID in several namespaces, e.g. <span><b>:inventory/id</b></span>, <span><b>:order/id</b></span>, and so on. The fact that <span><b>:user/id&nbsp;</b></span>is <i>not</i> a UUID is inconsistent, and newer programs should not have to put up with this.</p><p>Namespaces let you improve the situation without breaking existing programs. You can introduce <span><b>:user-v2/id</b></span>, and new programs can ignore names in the&nbsp;<b><span>user</span></b>&nbsp;namespace. If you don't like <b><span>v2</span></b>, you can also pick a more semantic name for the new namespace.</p><h3>9. &nbsp;Annotate your schema.</h3><p>Databases are good at storing data about your schema. Adding annotations to your schema can help both human readers and make sense of how the schema grew over time. For example:</p><ul><li>you could annotate names that are not recommended for new programs with a <span><b>:schema/deprecated</b></span> flag, or you could get fancier still with <span><b>:schema/deprecated-at</b></span> or <span><b>:schema/deprecated-because</b></span>. Note that such deprecated names are still <i>never</i> removed (Rule Five).</li><li>you could provide <span><b>:schema/see-also</b></span> or <span><b>:schema/see-instead</b></span> pointers to more current conventions.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In fact, all the database refactoring patterns that are typically implemented as breaking changes could be implemented non-destructively, with the refactoring details recorded as an annotation. For example, the breaking <a href="http://databaserefactoring.com/SplitColumns.html" target="_blank">"split column" refactoring</a>&nbsp;might instead be implemented as schema growth:</p><ul><li>add N new columns</li><li>(optional) add a <span><b>:schema/split-into</b></span> attribute on the original column whose value is the new columns, and possibly even the recipe for the split</li></ul><h3>10. Plan for accretion.</h3><p>If a system is going to grow at all, then programs must not bake in limiting presumptions. &nbsp;For example: If a schema states that <span><b>:user/id</b></span> is a string, then programs can rely on <span><b>:user/id</b></span> being a string and not occasionally an integer or a boolean. &nbsp;But a program cannot assume that a user entity will be limited to a the set of attributes previously seen, or that it understands the semantics of attributes that it has not seen before.</p><h3>Are these rules specific to a particular database?</h3><p>No. These rules apply to almost any SQL or NoSQL database. &nbsp;The rules even apply to the so-called "schemaless" databases. &nbsp;A better word for schemaless is "schema-implicit", i.e. the schema is implicit in your data and the database has no reified awareness of it. &nbsp;With an implicit schema, all the rules still apply, except that the database is impotent to help you (no Rule 3).</p><h3>In Context</h3><p>Many of the resources on migrations, refactoring, and database evolution emphasize repeatability and the needs of new programs, without making the top-level distinctions of growth vs. breakage and prod vs. dev. As a result, these resources encourage breaking the rules in this article.</p><p>Happily, these resources can easily be recast in growth-only terms. &nbsp;You <i>can</i> grow your schema without breaking your app. You <i>can</i> continuously deploy without continuously propagating breakage. &nbsp;Here's what it looks like <a href="http://docs.datomic.com/best-practices.html#production-schema" target="_blank">in Datomic</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <h2 id="user-content-what-happened"><a href="#what-happened">What happened?</a></h2>
<p>macOS Sonoma and macOS Ventura 13.6 were released with multiple serious bugs in their upgrade and boot process. Combined, these bugs can create conditions where a machine always boots to a black screen, no matter what power button press combination is used. This leaves users stuck, and the only solution is to use DFU recovery.</p>
<p>This situation can happen with certain settings on certain models, when multiple macOS versions are installed side by side (one Sonoma, one earlier). Since Asahi Linux behaves as if it were macOS 12.3/12.4/13.5 (depending on model and installation time), dual-boot installs of macOS Sonoma and Asahi Linux have the same effect. For macOS 13.6, this situation doesn't even require a dual-boot system, and can be triggered stand-alone as the only installed OS.</p>
<p><strong>We have updated the Asahi Linux installer to automatically perform an integrity check and diagnose your system on startup</strong>. To run it, paste this command into Terminal in macOS:</p>
<p><code>curl https://alx.sh | sh</code></p>
<p>You can quit the installer once you reach the main menu, without making any changes to your system.</p>
<p>Apple bug reports: FB13319681 and FB13319708</p>
<h2 id="user-content-what-are-the-bugs-exactly"><a href="#what-are-the-bugs-exactly">What are the bugs exactly</a></h2>
<p>There are two bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>macOS Sonoma upgrades use the previously installed version as System Recovery. This makes some sense, but does not consider backwards compatibility problems between older RecoveryOS and newer firmware. If this mismatch causes recoveryOS to fail to boot, this will leave System Recovery unusable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For 14" and 16" models: Once System Firmware is updated to the macOS Sonoma version, if the display is configured to a refresh rate other than ProMotion, that system will no longer be able to boot into older macOS installs nor Asahi Linux correctly. This includes recovery mode when those systems are set as the default boot OS, <strong>and also System Recovery</strong> at least until the next subsequent OS upgrade.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-what-happens-if-i-get-hit-by-the-bug-will-i-lose-data"><a href="#what-happens-if-i-get-hit-by-the-bug-will-i-lose-data">What happens if I get hit by the bug? Will I lose data?</a></h2>
<p>You will need another Mac to recover from the fault using DFU mode. However, you will <em>not</em> lose data.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-what-machines-are-affected"><a href="#what-machines-are-affected">What machines are affected?</a></h2>
<p>MacBook Pro models with ProMotion displays (14" and 16") are affected by the black screen boot bug.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-what-versions-are-affected"><a href="#what-versions-are-affected">What versions are affected?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>macOS Sonoma 14.0+ (not fixed as of 2023-10-31)</li>
<li>macOS Ventura 13.6+ (uses 14.0 firmware)</li>
<li>Possibly: macOS Monterey 12.7 (unconfirmed)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-what-should-i-do"><a href="#what-should-i-do">What should I do?</a></h2>
<h3 id="user-content-i-have-not-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-or-macos-ventura-136-yet-and-i-want-to"><a href="#i-have-not-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-or-macos-ventura-136-yet-and-i-want-to">I have not upgraded to macOS Sonoma (or macOS Ventura 13.6) yet and I want to</a></h3>
<p>We recommend waiting until these issues are fixed by Apple before upgrading. If you want to risk it and you have a 14" or 16" machine, <strong>make sure the display refresh rate is set to ProMotion</strong> before attempting the upgrade. You might still end up with a corrupted System Recovery, which can only be fixed with DFU mode or a subsequent successful upgrade.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you plan to install Asahi Linux or not, we recommend running the Asahi Linux installer after a Sonoma upgrade to check the status of your System Recovery partition. It will inform you about any issues prior to the main menu, before any changes are made to your system.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-i-have-not-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-or-macos-ventura-136-yet-and-im-in-no-rush"><a href="#i-have-not-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-or-macos-ventura-136-yet-and-im-in-no-rush">I have not upgraded to macOS Sonoma (or macOS Ventura 13.6) yet and I'm in no rush</a></h3>
<p>Feel free to stay on macOS version 13.5 or earlier for the time being. You can safely install Asahi Linux if you wish.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-i-have-already-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-and-i-want-to-install-asahi-linux"><a href="#i-have-already-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-and-i-want-to-install-asahi-linux">I have already upgraded to macOS Sonoma and I want to install Asahi Linux</a></h3>
<p>The Asahi Linux installer has been updated to check the version of your System Recovery, and will inform you of the risks if there is a mismatch. It will also check the ProMotion refresh rate, and refuse to install if it is set to anything other than ProMotion mode. Therefore, it is safe to install at this time.</p>
<p>Start the installation process normally. Follow the prompts carefully and read all the information printed. If your System Recovery version is mismatched, make sure you understand the risks. If your display refresh rate is incorrect, the installer will ask you to change it.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-i-have-already-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-and-i-have-asahi-linux"><a href="#i-have-already-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-and-i-have-asahi-linux">I have already upgraded to macOS Sonoma and I have Asahi Linux</a></h3>
<p>If you are currently booted into macOS, ensure the display refresh rate is set to ProMotion (for 14" and 16" machines).</p>
<p>We recommend running the Asahi Linux installer again to verify the integrity of your System RecoveryOS partition and ProMotion status. If there is a problem, you should refrain from making any major changes to your system until the issue is fixed by Apple.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-i-am-affected-to-the-issue-what-do-i-do"><a href="#i-am-affected-to-the-issue-what-do-i-do">I am affected to the issue, what do I do?</a></h3>
<p>If your machine boots to a black screen (brief Apple logo, then nothing), first attempt a regular recoveryOS boot by fully powering down the machine, then holding down the power button.</p>
<p>If that does not work, try booting into System RecoveryOS. To do this, fully power down the machine, and then perform a fast "tap-and-hold" power button gesture (press and release once, then press and hold).</p>
<p>If that also leads to the same problem, unfortunately you will have to resort to DFU mode. See the following section for details.</p>
<p>If you can successfully reach a boot menu, select your macOS Sonoma install and hold down Option while confirming your selection to make it the default boot OS. <strong>If you have macOS 13.6 ventura instead, follow the special section below.</strong></p>
<h3 id="user-content-how-do-i-fix-my-machine-with-dfu-mode"><a href="#how-do-i-fix-my-machine-with-dfu-mode">How do I fix my machine with DFU mode?</a></h3>
<p>First, you will need another Mac running a recent version of macOS (an Intel Mac is OK). Install Apple Configurator from the App Store on the other Mac and open it.</p>
<p>Follow <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gu/guide/apple-configurator-mac/apdd5f3c75ad/mac" rel="nofollow">Apple's</a> instructions to connect your two machines together, and put your target machine in DFU mode. The target machine's display should remain off at this point.</p>
<p>You should see a large "DFU" icon in Apple Configurator. If you see anything else, the machine is not in the correct mode. Repeat the procedure and try again.</p>
<p>Once you see the DFU icon, right click it and select Advanced → Revive. This will begin the revive process.</p>
<p>If you get a message saying "A system update is required for this device", you can ignore it and press "Restore Anyway". This process has been tested with another Mac running macOS 13.5.</p>
<p>Follow the prompts and accept any accessory connection requests. Do not leave the machine unattended, as you might miss one of those prompts (and there is a timeout). The process will take a few minutes to complete.</p>
<p>Once the Revive process completes, the machine should boot into macOS Recovery. Follow the prompts and authenticate yourself.</p>
<p>After this, the machine will reboot into the Boot Picker.</p>
<p><strong>If you have macOS 13.6 ventura instead, follow the special section below.</strong></p>
<p>Select your macOS Sonoma install, then go into the Display settings page and set the display refresh rate to ProMotion. This will prevent the problem from reoccurring.</p>
<p>Should you wind up with a "black screen boot" again after this point, follow the steps in the previous section to perform the "tap-and-hold" power gesture. This should now work properly, as your System RecoveryOS has been updated. You may then select macOS again and fix the display refresh rate.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-i-dont-have-another-mac-to-use-dfu-mode-what-do-i-do"><a href="#i-dont-have-another-mac-to-use-dfu-mode-what-do-i-do">I don't have another Mac to use DFU mode! What do I do?</a></h3>
<p>You can take your Mac to the Apple Store and ask them to do a <strong>DFU Revive</strong>. Make sure they do <strong>not</strong> do a Restore, which would wipe all your data. They should perform this service for free. Do not let them charge you any money for it. This is a problem Apple caused, and purely a software issue. If the technicians claim there is hardware damage, they are wrong.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-what-if-i-have-macos-136-ventura-and-not-sonoma"><a href="#what-if-i-have-macos-136-ventura-and-not-sonoma">What if I have macOS 13.6 Ventura and not Sonoma?</a></h3>
<p>macOS 13.6 Ventura uses the macOS Sonoma System Firmware, but suffers from the problem. Even users with just 13.6 installed single-boot are affected by this issue (no Asahi Linux needed). We do not understand how Apple managed to release an OS update that, when upgraded to normally, leaves machines unbootable if their display refresh rate is not the default. This seems to have been a major QA oversight by Apple.</p>
<p>If your system has 13.6 Ventura and ended up in the black boot situation, unfortunately the only known solution is to upgrade to Sonoma. From the Boot Picker, select Settings. This will boot into recoveryOS. From there, select "Install macOS Sonoma". Follow the prompts and select your existing macOS volume. This will upgrade macOS without losing your data.</p>
