<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">Just outside public view, the American <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/cigna-pxdx-medical-health-insurance-rejection-claims">health insurance industry’s algorithms</a>, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/unitedhealth-healthcare-insurance-denial-ulcerative-colitis">employees</a> and executives process tens of millions of claims for people seeking medical care.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">Sometimes, as ProPublica has reported, insurers base decisions on what’s good for the company’s bottom line rather than what’s good for the patient’s health. Sometimes, insurers make mistakes. In one case we learned about, a company denied a child’s treatment because it based its judgment on adult guidelines instead of pediatric ones. In another, an internal reviewer misread what type of surgery the patient sought and denied coverage based on that error.</p>
        
    
                        


   
            
            
            
            

   
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">At first, these patients had no idea why they were denied treatment. But in each instance, insurance employees left a paper trail — in notes, emails or recordings of phone calls — explaining what happened. Patients and advocates used what they found in those records to craft appeals and ultimately receive the care they needed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0"><a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/health-plans/erisa#:~:text=The%20Employee%20Retirement%20Income%20Security,for%20individuals%20in%20these%20plans.">Federal law</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/147.136">regulations</a> require insurers to hand over exactly this sort of information in response to a written request. And they have to do it fast: Most people who get insurance through an employer should get the records, called claim files, within 30 days.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">There’s just one catch: Some insurers aren’t turning files over like they’re supposed to. We followed ProPublica readers through the process with five different insurers. Several companies only shared documents with patients after we reached out.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">Our team discovered how useful claim files can be after a patient shared internal notes and calculations that a health insurer had made about his case. But few health insurers advertise this service or offer clear instructions for getting these records. To help fill that gap, we published a guide explaining <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/find-out-why-health-insurance-claim-denied">how to submit a claim file request</a>. We also <a href="https://propublica.jotform.com/231996124151859">shared resources with health care providers</a> and patient advocates nationwide, including request letter templates.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">More than 120 people have told us that they have since requested or intend to request their claim files. Though a handful say they received information that helped them understand why their health insurer denied coverage, many more have been running into challenges. They’ve told us about insurers blowing past deadlines, wrongly requiring subpoenas and —&nbsp;in several cases — misinterpreting their request entirely.</p>
        
    
                    
            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">We shared a summary of these examples with Tim Hauser, a deputy assistant secretary with the Department of Labor. His office oversees claim file laws that cover more than 131 million people. He said insurers who fail to provide records are breaking the law. “The claimant really needs to be able to see what the relevant evidence is so that they can respond to it,” he said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">We brought our findings to five insurance companies. We presented them with details about the requests patients had made and how the company had responded, and we asked for an explanation of what happened in each case.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">All of the insurers acknowledged that the patients were entitled to the material they’d asked for. Four began sending the files after our inquiry. Two, spokespeople told us, are updating policies to handle future requests. Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield spokesperson Michael Bowman said the company needed to better train staff on the rules “to close any gaps to prevent this from occurring in the future.” Cigna spokesperson Justine Sessions admitted that patients do not need a subpoena to access their records, contrary to what the insurer had told a member. She said the company would update its “policies and communications to reflect that for future requests. We regret that we did not make these updates sooner and apologize for any frustration or confusion this has caused our customers.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">By crowdsourcing people’s experiences, we identified some patterns in health insurers’ behavior. Here are some of the most common issues people encountered — and what to watch out for if you <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/claimfile/">submit your own request</a>:</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Insurers Asking for Unnecessary Subpoenas or Court Orders</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">Cigna and Anthem told members that they would need to obtain a court order or subpoena to access their claim file records.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">“This is completely unheard of,” said Wells Wilkinson, a senior attorney with the nonprofit legal group Public Health Advocates who regularly files these requests. “It also sounds completely illegal. The consumer has the right to any information used by the health plan in the context of the denial.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">On July 12, Lisa Kays, a Maryland resident, asked Cigna for phone call records related to its decision to deny coverage for her 4-year-old son’s speech therapy. “We couldn’t afford to just give up,” Kays said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">In September, Cigna sent her a letter saying she would need to submit a subpoena to get any transcripts or recordings.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.1">After ProPublica inquired, the company sent Kays partial transcripts of the calls. It also reimbursed her for some of the previously denied coverage. She is still waiting for the recordings.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">We asked Anthem about a similar case. On July 19, a call center agent told Pamela Tsigdinos she would need a subpoena to receive her claim file records. Tsigdinos had submitted the request 50 days earlier.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">Bowman, the Anthem spokesperson, told us the response was an error and apologized. The company compiled the claim file and sent it to Tsigdinos.</p>

<h3>Insurers Confusing Claim File Requests With Appeals</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.1">At least five people told ProPublica that, after submitting a request for a claim file, their health insurer mistook the request for an appeal.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">We brought three cases to UnitedHealthcare. S.J. Farris requested her claim file from the company on May 10. Five days later, she received a response stating that her request for an appeal had been received. Farris sent a clarifying letter but was met with a call from an appeals agent based in Ireland. “I asked her to send the claim files,” Farris said. “She had no idea what I was talking about.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">After ProPublica sent the company questions, Farris received a call from UnitedHealth in October. They told her that the insurer was working on her claim file and that she should expect it soon. In a statement to ProPublica, UnitedHealth spokesperson Maria Gordon Shydlo said: “We take our responsibility to provide members access to their records seriously and have processes in place to comply with the law. We are sorry for any inconvenience.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">After Beth Tolley sent Anthem a claim file request on behalf of her granddaughter, she received a letter from the health insurer stating, “We’ve received a request from Beth Tolley for an appeal.” This left Tolley confused since, in its last communication, Anthem had said all avenues of appeal with its office had been exhausted.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">In early October, Anthem sent the Tolley family a check for the amount it had initially declined to cover. Bowman told ProPublica that the company would be sending the records soon. </p>

<h3>Insurers Blowing Past the 30-Day Deadline</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">For most people who get insurance through their employers, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/find-out-why-health-insurance-claim-denied">insurers are required to send claim files back</a> within 30 days, according to federal law.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">Twelve of the people whose requests ProPublica followed did not receive their records within that time frame even though they had these types of plans. Five of those had been waiting for responses from their insurers for more than 70 days before ProPublica contacted the companies with questions.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">Isabella Gonzalez submitted a claim file request via certified mail on Aug. 8. When she called Aetna to get an update, a representative told her they did not see it in the system and advised her to upload it onto the insurer’s online portal, which she did. She called back a few days later. A different customer service employee told her Aetna would respond in 45 days.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0">Alex Kepnes, the executive director of communications for Aetna, said the company at first did not recognize what Gonzalez was asking for and therefore did not respond to it. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.1">Kepnes declined to respond to follow-up questions about why staff failed to correctly identify the request and whether the company would be taking action to ensure this does not happen again.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.2">Other companies that failed to follow the 30-day timeline include UnitedHealth, Anthem and Cigna. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.3">“It’s really important that these responses be timely,” said Hauser, the Department of Labor official. “If that’s not happening, it’s really contrary to the regulation.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Our 10 person startup gets acquired by Google, we rebuild our product the Google way, and begin to understand that amazing things are possible at Google, if you play the Google game. A follow up to <a href="https://shreyans.org/venmo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">What I learned at Venmo</a> and <a href="https://shreyans.org/socratic" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">What I learned at Socratic</a></em></p>
<p><img src="https://shreyans.org/images/posts/google/nooglers.jpg" alt="Nooglers"></p>
<hr>
<p>As we started to raise <a href="https://shreyans.org/socratic">Socratic’s</a> Series B in 2017, we quickly learned that our focus on getting usage at the expense of revenue was going to bite us. Our growth got us in the door, but every VC asked for a monetization plan, and in the process of figuring that out we concluded that an education app focused on credit-card-less high school students wasn’t going to become a big business.</p>
<p>Around the same time, we were introduced to Evan Spiegel, the CEO of Snapchat. Evan suggested a partnership to integrate our camera-based homework helper into their app. But one of our advisors figured that if he introduced you to their Head of Corporate Development, he may be suggesting an eventual acquisition, and if so, we should get a competitive process going. So we did, and reached out to Microsoft, Chegg, Byju’s, and Google.</p>
<p>My co-founder, Chris, had previously worked at Google and reconnected with his past manager to get an intro to Lens - Google’s camera-first app. What we didn’t know was that she had recently started an education effort of her own, along with the co-founders of Khan Academy and Android. We met and learned that we had hugely overlapping visions for a learning-focused, AI-powered tutor. Maybe it helped that we had just won Google’s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/topic?id=campaign_editorial_apps_bestof2017" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Android App of the Year</a>, but soon after that meeting, we kicked off a process that led to Google acquiring Socratic in March of 2018.</p>
<p>We merged with an existing team of the same size, composed of multiple long tenured Googlers. Chris and I became the product and engineering leads, tasked with building an AI-powered tutor and bringing those capabilities to Google’s largest products.</p>
<p>Over the next three years, we rebuilt Socratic and relaunched it as “Socratic by Google”<sup><a href="#note-1">1</a></sup>, shipped Socratic features in Search and Lens, released a math solver and prototyped a step-by-step math tutor, and built capabilities that are being used across Google.</p>
<p>Some things I learned along the way:</p>
<p><strong>Working at Google is like having a second passport.</strong> Go to any major city in the world and your badge<sup><a href="#note-2">2</a></sup> unlocks a beautiful office with great food, desks, and a high speed link to every person in Google’s 200,000+ person network. And like visiting America as a foreigner, everything you see inside feels oddly familiar because of its massive exported influence, yet is just slightly different.</p>
<p>Shockingly, you get immediate access to all of it. Access to their gigantic monorepo<sup><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2854146" target="_blank">🔗</a></sup> with billions of lines of code covering almost all their products. Live statuses of their globe-covering data centers. Strategy documents spanning two decades of history. And direct access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Dean" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">legends</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Google does things the Google way.</strong> Just about every piece of software and infrastructure used at Google was built at Google, a natural result of facing the hardest engineering problems earlier than most companies. At Google's scale, the external world ceases to exist and is only rarely and carefully allowed to enter their walls.</p>
<p>This meant that there was no chance of keeping our existing codebase. We would need to start from scratch, rediscovering our product insights with the new team, then rebuilding our app on Google’s stack. Problems we had already solved, like our ML system to classify the topics in a homework problem, had to be re-solved using Search techniques and to Search standards, which needless to say were higher than ours. </p>
<p>One place we were able to break Google's mold was with ‘Ceebo’, our app mascot. Look at Google’s collection of app icons and you’ll see four colors and simple shapes. Works for them, but boring to us. They pushed (“we don’t anthropomorphize”), we pushed back (“you do with Android!”), until we finally got our way because we were too small to matter. Ceebo lives on as our app icon, and has blossomed within Google, where dozens of variants have been illustrated, and Ceebo pops up in surprising docs and sites all around Google. </p>
<p><img src="https://shreyans.org/images/posts/google/google_app_logos.png" alt="The usual Google app logos">
<em>The usual Google app logos vs. Ceebo</em></p>
<p><img src="https://shreyans.org/images/posts/google/socratic_app_logo.png" alt="Socratic's cbo"></p><p><strong>Simple things done repeatedly feel magical.</strong> Re-building our query classification system alongside Search veterans was an illuminating peek into how Search itself was built. On the one hand there’s the incredible depth of information retrieval tools, and the mind-boggling ability to calculate and add a new signal to <em>every page on the Internet</em> (e.g. <code>contains_math</code>, or <code>subject:chemistry</code>).</p>
<p>On the other hand there was the discovery that most Search improvements are manually reviewed by engineers through ‘side-by-side’ comparisons between old and new results...on spreadsheets! </p>
<p>One may expect Google engineering to largely consist of implementing PhD level algorithms, and while that's sometimes true, much of a search or AI engineer's job involves looking at examples, spotting patterns, hand labelling data, and other non-scalable, in-the-weeds analysis. This seems to be generally true among the best AI teams:</p>
<p><em>"One pattern I noticed is that great AI researchers are willing to manually inspect lots of data. And more than that, they build infrastructure that allows them to manually inspect data quickly. Though not glamorous, manually examining data gives valuable intuitions about the problem."</em><sup><a href="https://twitter.com/_jasonwei/status/1708921475829481683" target="_blank">🔗</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Most problems aren’t worth Google’s time, but surprising ones are.</strong> Most 10-50 million user problems aren’t worth Google's time, and don’t fit their strategy. But they’ll take on significant effort on problems that do fit their nature, strategy, and someone’s promotion goals. </p>
<p>One such example: computer vision is a big part of Socratic’s interface, specifically being able to read text and math in images. As a startup we used a 3rd party tool, but between exposing sensitive data, expectations of scale, and a complex vendor review process - using it within Google proved too difficult. Sometimes it’s easier to just buy the company to bring the tech in-house. Other times, as in our case, there’s an AI research team that’s interested in the problem, hires a top PhD talent to work on it, and delivers a world-class math recognition API within 6 months.</p>
<p>Of course, if you’ve read Steve Yegge’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">classic blog post</a> comparing Google and Amazon's platforms, you’ll know that this world class service was not externalized.</p>
<p><strong>Google is an ever shifting web of goals and efforts.</strong> Amazing things are possible at Google, if the right people care about them. A VP that gets it, a research team with a related charter, or compatibility with an org’s goals. Navigating this mess of interests is half of a PM’s job. And then you need the blessing of approvers like privacy, trust and safety, and infra capacity. It takes dozens of conversations to know if an idea is viable, and hundreds more to make it a reality.</p>
<p>And that’s the happy path. Amazing things are possible at Google, if the right people <em>keep</em> caring about them. Team goals can change in any given quarter, and entire teams can disappear in the face of a 'reorg', a phenomenon so common that Googlers can look past the tragedy and see the comedy in it.</p>
<p>Suppose you dodge all those bullets, you might still wake up to find that while you were working on your project, two distant teams were also working on the same idea, and the time has come to fight it out because only one can proceed. The internal users of the losing projects will find that the API they depended on is now ‘deprecated’, but the replacement, well it’s not quite ready yet.</p>
<p><strong>Googlers wanted to ship great work, but often couldn’t.</strong> While there were undoubtedly people who came in for the food, worked 3 hours a day, and enjoyed their early retirements, all the people I met were earnest, hard-working, and wanted to do great work.</p>
<p>What beat them down were the gauntlet of reviews, the frequent re-orgs, the institutional scar tissue from past failures, and the complexity of doing even simple things on the world stage. Startups can afford to ignore many concerns, Googlers rarely can.</p>
<p>What also got in the way were the people themselves - all the smart people who could argue against anything but not <em>for</em> something, all the leaders who lacked the courage to speak the uncomfortable truth, and all the people that were hired without a clear project to work on, but must still be retained through promotion-worthy made-up work.</p>
<p><img src="https://shreyans.org/images/posts/google/nooglers-no-more.jpg" alt="Nooglers no more"></p>
<p><strong>Top heavy orgs are hard to steer.</strong> Another blocker to progress that I saw up close was the imbalance of a top heavy team. A team with multiple successful co-founders and 10-20 year Google veterans might sound like a recipe for great things, but it’s also a recipe for gridlock.</p>
<p>This structure might work if there are multiple areas to explore, clear goals, and strong autonomy to pursue those paths. But if you want to work on one unified product, it needs a clear leader, with a clear direction, and more doers than thinkers. And counter-intuitively, adding more people to an early-stage project doesn't make it go faster.</p>
<p><strong>Technical debt is real. So is process debt.</strong> Engineers are used to talking about <em>technical debt</em>: a corner that you cut today to save time and ship a feature; a loan from your future self that is either paid back in time or it slowly gets more expensive to deal with. Good teams regularly pay down debt by cleaning things up on quieter days.</p>
<p>Just as real is process debt. A review added because of a launch gone wrong. A new legal check to guard against possible litigation. A section added to a document template. Layers accumulate over the years until you end up unable to release a new feature for months after it's ready because it's stuck between reviews, with an unclear path out.</p>
<p>In some rare cases, process is rolled back: Google recently changed their onerous perf(ormance review) process, from twice a year to once, from a long to a short questionnaire, and hopefully from 30+% of a manager's year to less than 10%.</p>
<p>And sometimes an external threat either forces this change, or percipitates a company's decline. Google invented the technologies behind ChatGPT, but wasn't the one to release that product. Now it must resolve the growing tension between the builders that want to reclaim Google's AI lead, and the reviewers that want to guard against all possible troubles<sup><a href="https://www.rtinsights.com/google-svp-cautions-against-launching-ai-products-too-quickly/" target="_blank">🔗</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Amazing things are possible at Google, if you play the right game.</strong> Google used to have a set of internal values they called "The Three Respects": respect the user, respect each other, and respect the opportunity. The first two are somewhat easy to understand, but the third one confused most people. My interpretation is as follows: you're at Google, an insanely profitable, genius-filled enterprise. You're well-paid, well-fed, and live in the eternal spring paradise of Silicon Valley. <em>What's the best thing you can do with this insane luck?</em></p>
<p>And my answer to that question echoes what Richard Hamming said in his great talk, <em>You and Your Research</em><sup><a href="https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/stripe-press/TAODSAE_zine_press.pdf" target="_blank">🔗</a></sup>: you must find the most important problem in your field, and play whatever games necessary to solve it.</p>
<p>Practically, what this means is to first do the work that is given to you. But once that's under control, to reach out into the vast Google network, to learn what's being planned and invented, to coalesce a clear image of the future, to give it shape through docs and demos, to find the leaders whose goals align with this image, and to sell the idea as persistently as you can.</p>
<p>To some extent I did this. One of my favorite examples was a demo for a step-by-step math tutor, built on top of our new math solver, made by three of us on the side over a few months. The demo gave our vision for intelligent tutoring a tangible form - it had a link, it could be used, it could be shared. It grounded conversations, gave people something specific to react to, and took on a life outside our team, being passed around, independently discussed, and leading back to us.</p>
<p>I also saw this go wrong. One of our leaders clearly saw the world we were heading towards, had designers make great demos, and would share them whenever he could. But he was trapped in the wrong part of the company, and his boss's goals pointed elsewhere. He eventually switched to a more compatible team, and his dream now has a chance of becoming a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Many acquisitions fail. Socratic's story is mixed.</strong> On one hand, we managed to merge two vastly different cultures, our product lives on and has grown to serve ~5 <em>billion</em> queries a year, and careers across the Socratic team have bloomed.</p>
<p>On the other, both Chris and I left Google to found startups<sup><a href="#note-3">3</a></sup>, and neither the Socratic team nor Google as a whole have yet produced an AI powered tutor worthy of Google's capabilities. But a few Socratic Googlers might yet make it happen, unless they've been re-org'd.</p>

				<p id="speakable-summary"><span>As dawn breaks</span> over Silicon Valley, the world is getting its first look at Pathfinder 1, a prototype electric airship that its maker LTA Research hopes will kickstart a new era in climate-friendly air travel, and accelerate the humanitarian work of its funder, Google co-founder Sergey Brin.</p>
<p>The airship — its snow-white steampunk profile visible from the busy 101 highway — has taken drone technology such as fly-by-wire controls, electric motors and lidar sensing, and supersized them to something longer than three Boeing 737s, potentially able to carry tons of cargo over many hundreds of miles.</p>
<p>“It’s been 10 years of blood, sweat and tears,” LTA CEO Alan Weston told TechCrunch on the eve of the unveiling. “Now we must show that this can reliably fly in real-world conditions. And we’re going to do that.”</p>
<p>A series of increasingly ambitious flight tests lie ahead, before Pathfinder 1 is moved to Akron, Ohio, where <a href="https://www.ltaresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LTA Research</a> is planning an even larger airship, the Pathfinder 3. The company eventually hopes to produce a family of airships to provide disaster relief where roads and airports are damaged, as well as zero-carbon passenger transportation.</p>
<p>For the next year however, the gigantic airship looks set to become a Silicon Valley landmark as its novel materials and systems are methodically put through their paces within shouting distance of companies like Google, Meta and Amazon. “I’m excited about the potential of not building just one airship, but laying the foundation for many airships to be built,” said Weston. “The innovations and the technologies that we’re about to demonstrate have the potential to lay the foundation for a new industry.”</p>
<h2>The biggest aircraft in almost a century</h2>

<p>At 124.5 meters long, Pathfinder 1 dwarfs the current Goodyear airships and even the massive Stratolaunch plane designed to launch orbital rockets. It’s the largest aircraft to take to the skies since the gargantuan Hindenburg airship of the 1930s. Although similar in appearance to that ill-fated airship, and using a passenger gondola supplied by Zeppelin, the Pathfinder 1 was mostly built from the ground up using new materials and technologies.</p>
<p>LTA’s airship uses stable helium rather than flammable hydrogen as a lifting gas, held in 13 giant rip-stop nylon cells and monitored by lidar laser systems. A rigid framework of 10,000 carbon-fiber reinforced tubes and 3,000 titanium hubs form a protective skeleton around the gas cells, surrounded by a lightweight synthetic Tedlar skin.</p>
<p>Twelve electric motors powered by diesel generators and batteries enable vertical take-off and landing. They can propel the Pathfinder 1 at up to 65 knots (75 mph), although its initial flights will be at much lower speeds.</p>
<p>This morning, the airship floated silently from its WW2-era hangar at NASA’s Moffett Field at walking pace, steered by ropes held by dozens of the company’s engineers, technicians and ground crew.</p>
<p>The whole operation occurred under the cover of darkness, not because LTA has something to hide but because the airship’s flight test program begins with the first rays of the morning sun. The first lesson its engineers hope to learn is how Pathfinder 1’s approximately one million cubic feet of helium and weather resistant polymer skin will respond to the warming effect of Californian sunshine.</p>
<p>“We have sophisticated methodology that allows us to replicate real-world conditions using static test stands,” said Jillian Hilenski, senior mechanical engineer at LTA. “However, dynamic on-ship flight tests provide the best data on the health and efficiency of the airship.”</p>
<h2>Test, test, test again</h2>

<p>At the start of September, the FAA issued a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/lta-airship-faa-clearance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special airworthiness certificate</a> for the Pathfinder 1 allowing test flights in and around Moffett Field and the nearby Palo Alto airport, and over the southern part of the San Francisco Bay.</p>
<p>Those tests will initially happen just a few feet off the ground, with the airship tethered to a mobile tripod mast. These will be followed by simple maneuvers around Moffett Field, before a series of flights out and over the Bay.</p>
<p>“The advantages of going over the water are multiple,” said Weston. “First of all, when you come off Moffett Field, the air is smoother over the Bay than it is anywhere else. That’s very important. And there’s not much in the way of traffic on the surface, so that’s a big plus as well.”</p>
<p>Safety is top of Weston’s mind as he works to reintroduce rigid airships to the skies of North America — and ultimately the world. The first 50 flights of Pathfinder 1 covered by the FAA certificate will allow flights no higher than 1,500 feet, and will use two pilots rather than the single pilot the airship was designed to need.</p>
<p>“I can count the number of companies in the lighter-than-air space on my hands, and we all have a lot to lose if anybody has a serious problem,” he said. Weston says LTA is working closely with the FAA to ensure that anything the company builds has a safe and sensible path to full certification. “The last maiden flight of an airship like this was the Graf Zeppelin II in 1938,” he noted during the interview. “The FAA wasn’t even around then.”</p>
<h2>Back to the future</h2>
<p>In a world of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/evtol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eVTOL air-taxis</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/electric-aircraft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electric aviation startups</a> and hydrogen planes, Weston acknowledges that airships are only ever likely to be a partial solution. “I can’t see airships replacing aircraft,” he said. “But I do see a niche for airships to be part of the transportation architecture that reduces the carbon footprint of air travel.”</p>
<p>Another important niche could be responding to natural disasters like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and hurricanes. Sergey Brin also funds a nonprofit called <a href="https://www.gsd.ngo/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Support and Development</a> that aims to deliver humanitarian aid within the first 24 to 96 hours of a disaster.</p>
<p>Brin founded GSD in 2015 after using his own superyacht to deploy medics to the scene of a cyclone in the South Pacific. The nonprofit has since partnered with the nonprofit YachtAid Global, and now also has its own purpose-built vessel, the <a href="https://www.gsd.ngo/en/what-we-do/humanitarian-vessel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MV Dawn</a>, that can swiftly transport dozens of doctors and aid workers, alongside life-saving supplies.</p>
<p>While Pathfinder 1 can carry about four tons of cargo in addition to its crew, water ballast and fuel, future humanitarian airships will need much larger capacities. They will also likely use zero-carbon technologies like hydrogen fuel cells for power, said Hilenski. That will involve a long, slow slog to validate the new technologies and to demonstrate, to the FAA and paying customers, that a new generation of super-large airships can match the generally excellent safety and reliability record of today’s commercial jets.</p>
<p>“What excites me about what we’ve done so far is that we’ve shown to ourselves, and we hope to show to the rest of the world, that we can scale in size and productivity,” said Weston. “And I believe in our potential to scale up again in the future.”</p>
<p>The FAA’s experimental certificate for the Pathfinder 1 expires in September 2024.</p>

                    <p>TL;DR</p>
<p>Today, we’re announcing a free early preview of CLion, which uses the ReSharper C++/Rider C++ language engine instead of the CLion "legacy" engine. The Preview build is available via our dedicated Toolbox App feed. At some point in 2024, depending on the results of the feedback collected, CLion Nova will be merged into CLion. Until then, the Preview build will be free to use and can be installed in parallel with your usual CLion (Classic) installation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" alt="CLion Nova" width="640" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Featured_Blog_1280x720_CLionNova.png"></a></p>
<h2 id="prehistory">Prehistory</h2>
<p>The first C++ engine by JetBrains was designed for AppCode, our IDE for iOS and macOS developers. It was part of the IntelliJ Platform, initially written in Java and later also in Kotlin. The approach and the architecture of the engine serve many languages in IntelliJ-based IDEs well; however, this design turned out not to be the best fit for the C++ language specifically.</p>
<p>To more quickly align with the evolution of C++ and to separate the engine and IDE processes, a clangd-based engine was later added to CLion. Built on our custom branch of clangd, this engine detects any warnings and errors, shows them in the editor, and suggests quick-fixes, as well as performing highlighting, completion, and certain navigation actions. It’s also used for things like <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2023/11/striving-for-better-cpp-code-part-i-data-flow-analysis-basics/">data flow analysis</a> and MISRA checks. Meanwhile, CLion’s “legacy” engine is responsible for other code insight features like refactorings. You can see a detailed “list of responsibilities” in our <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2023.3/c-support.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CLion documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Clangd has many advantages, but it isn’t very helpful when it comes to project-wide refactorings and actions. We prototyped a clangd-based indexer and even implemented an experimental <em>Find Usages</em> on top of it, which you can <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2023.3/find-highlight-usages.html#usages-clangdindexer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enable and evaluate in </a><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2023.3/find-highlight-usages.html#usages-clangdindexer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CLion</a>.</p>
<p>Another alternative developed by JetBrains for C++ is the language engine used in ReSharper C++ and Rider (for game development in C++). There is also a communication protocol in place that makes it possible for an IntelliJ-based IDE like Rider to communicate with the stand-alone backend process serving as a language engine. We have now adapted this protocol and the original engine to CLion as well!</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>In this new and experimental solution, we’re focused on the responsiveness, accuracy, and performance of the IDE. There are two main goals we have in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addressing the long-standing <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>quality</strong> issues of CLion caused by the usage of the “legacy” engine.</li>
<li>Unifying the user experience across all of our C++ tools, i.e. CLion, Rider, and ReSharper C++.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="CLion Nova About" width="531" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/about.png"></p>
<p>We named our new experimental preview <strong>CLion Nova,</strong> and the current version of CLion is now <strong>CLion Classic</strong>. In the future, we plan for CLion Nova to be merged into CLion Classic. No new product is envisaged.</p>
<h2 id="benefits_and_enhancements">Benefits and enhancements</h2>
<p>CLion Nova still uses two C++ language engines: a clangd-based one and the one used by ReSharper C++/Rider. Most of the features of CLion Classic should work exactly the same in CLion Nova.</p>
<p>The most notable benefits in terms of performance in CLion Nova are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster highlighting speeds, especially in the case of incremental code updates</li>
<li>A more responsive UI</li>
<li>Faster <em>Find Usages</em></li>
<li>Significantly fewer freezes and hangs in refactorings</li>
<li>Faster test indexing</li>
</ul>
<p>This unification also brings some new functions to CLion Nova that aren’t included in CLion Classic’s feature set:</p>
<ul>
<li>New refactorings like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Refactorings_for_CPP.html#intro_field" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduce field</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Refactorings_for_CPP.html#namespace_alias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduce namespace alias</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Refactorings_for_CPP.html#using_enum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduce using enumeration</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Refactorings_for_CPP.html#convert_to_scoped" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convert to scoped enumeration</a>.</li>
<li>New inspections, quick-fixes, and intentions like redundant qualifier, the replace <code>auto</code> with explicit type declaration, and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Code_Style_Assistance_in_CPP.html#sort_includes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sorting of </a><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Code_Style_Assistance_in_CPP.html#sort_includes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>#include</code></a><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Code_Style_Assistance_in_CPP.html#sort_includes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> directives</a>.</li>
<li>New code hints like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Settings_Inlay_Hints_CPP_Other.html#preprocessor-directive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preprocessor directive hints</a>﻿ and a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Inline_Parameter_Name_Hints.html#push-to-hint-mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Push-to-Hint mode</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="Sorting includes" width="600" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sort_includes.png"></p>
<h2 id="notable_differences">Notable differences</h2>
<p>Unlike CLion Classic, CLion Nova doesn’t use <strong>clangd</strong> for core IDE features like code completion or highlighting. However, the JetBrains’ clangd fork is still running alongside the new engine for various tasks (ClangFormat, Clang-Tidy, MISRA checks, data flow analysis, etc.).</p>
<p>There are a few things that will look and feel new to CLion Classic users when they start using CLion Nova:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the ways the IDE reacts when the user is typing are different.</li>
<li>Some UI elements and settings related to code insight features might look unusual or be found in unfamiliar locations.</li>
<li>Some code-related settings might have different default values in CLion Nova. On the first launch, CLion Nova will migrate some of your per-project and per-application settings from CLion Classic, but not all of them.</li>
<li>Switching between different language configurations (i.e. Debug/Release) might require more time for the code insight engine to catch up. There is also no option to switch resolve context per file.</li>
<li>ReSharper C++ is Windows-only, while Rider is cross-platform. Still, the ReSharper C++/Rider engine might not support non-Windows environments as seamlessly as a Windows one. It’s worth reporting such cases to us if you come across them.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="Type conversion hints settings" width="912" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/type_conversion_hints.png"></p>
<p>There’s also a list of currently missing functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Toolchains</strong>: Several options exist to set up <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2023.3/remote-development.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remote work</a> in CLion. Remote work with local sources is supported in CLion Nova, while remote work with a thin client (Gateway) is not yet available.</li>
<li><strong>Languages</strong>: Objective-C language, CUDA (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RSCPP-613" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RSCPP-613</a>, <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-26144" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPP-26144</a>), and some vendor-specific compiler extensions aren’t yet supported.</li>
<li>Some intentions and quick-fixes like <em>Simplify statement</em> are not supported at present (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-35879" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPP-35879</a>).</li>
<li>Some less popular refactorings are also missing. We plan to reintroduce the <em>Move</em> (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-35867" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPP-35867</a>) and <em>Inline Parameter</em> refactorings (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-35868" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPP-35868</a>) at a later date.</li>
<li>JetBrains’ AI Assistant is not yet available for CLion Nova.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how_to_install_clion_nova">How to install CLion Nova</h2>
<p>CLion Nova is a free early preview build available only via the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toolbox App</a>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="Toolbox app" width="427" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/toolbox_app.png"></p>
<p>CLion Nova is an Early Access Preview build, which means a login is required, but you can use it for free until CLion Nova merges into CLion. We’ll be publishing regular updates to CLion Nova, which will also be available via the Toolbox App.</p>
<p>Compared to CLion Classic, CLion Nova brings a more responsive UI, better overall IDE performance, and increased feature quality, especially with C++ code refactorings. Try it now and let us know what you think!</p>

<p>CLion Nova marks a big change and requires detailed testing in various environments. So we’re asking you, our users, for help! Given that you have a variety of environments and use cases, we want you to test out CLion Nova and share your experiences with us.</p>
<p>We are specifically interested in your thoughts on:</p>
<ul>
<li>What works better on your project in CLion Nova compared to CLion Classic?</li>
<li>What interrupts your workflow and prevents you from using the IDE in CLion Nova? Are these interruptions CLion Nova-specific, or are they also present in CLion Classic?</li>
</ul>
<p>After using CLion Nova for some time, you’ll be asked to submit a feedback form. We’d be grateful if you can spare the time to do so!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-dateline="" data-subscriber-content="">  <p><span>SPATA, Greece&nbsp;—&nbsp;</span></p><p>In an olive grove on the outskirts of Athens, grower Konstantinos Markou pushes aside the shoots of new growth to reveal the stump of a tree — a roughly 150-year-old specimen, he said, that was among 15 cut down on his neighbor’s land by thieves eager to turn it into money.</p><p>Surging olive oil prices, driven in part by <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-03-26/pray-for-rain-spanish-farmers-hold-unique-mass-amid-drought">two years of drought in Spain</a>, has meant opportunity for criminals across the Mediterranean. Warehouse break-ins, dilution of premium oil with inferior product and falsification of shipping data are on the rise in olive-growing heartlands of Greece, Spain and Italy. And perhaps worst of all: gangs using chainsaws to steal heavily laden branches and even entire trees from unguarded groves.</p><p>“The olive robbers can sometimes produce more oil than the owners themselves — seriously,” Markou said, before heading off to patrol his own grove at nightfall. </p><p>The crimes mean fewer olives for growers already contending with high production costs and climate changes that have brought warmer winters, major flooding and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-08-24/greece-wildfires-largest-ever-european-union">more intense forest fires</a>. In Italy’s southern Puglia region, growers are pleading with police to form an agriculture division. Greek farmers want to bring back a rural police division that was phased out in 2010. In Spain, a company has developed tracking devices that look like olives to try to catch thieves.</p><p>The groves outside Athens are part of an agricultural tradition that <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-nov-26-fi-47925-story.html">stretches back to antiquity</a>, on plains that now surround the city’s international airport. Some trees are centuries old.</p><p>Most of the thefts are of branches. When an entire tree is cut down, the thieves typically chop it up and load the pieces into a pickup truck, taking the olives to an oil mill and selling the wood to lumberyards or firewood vendors.</p><p>The robbers “look for heavily loaded branches and they cut them,” said Neilos Papachristou, who runs an olive mill and nearby grove in a fourth-generation family business. “So, not only do they steal our olives, but they cause the tree serious harm. It takes four to five years for it to return to normal.”</p><p>The thefts are driving some growers to harvest early, which means accepting lower yields to avoid long-term damage to their trees. Christos Bekas was among the farmers at Papachristou’s mill who were dumping their crop into stainless steel loading bins, untying sacks and tipping over tall wicker baskets from the back of their pickup trucks.</p><p>Bekas, who owns 5,000 olive trees, suffered repeated raids by thieves before deciding to take an early harvest. That has meant needing 2½ times as much in the weight of the olives to produce a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of oil as last year, he said.</p><p>“And all this after we’ve been spending nights guarding our fields,” he said. ”The situation is appalling.”</p><p>After decades of growth, the global olive oil market has been disrupted by a nearly <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-09-04/drought-europe-climate-change">two-year drought in Spain</a>, which typically accounts for about 40% of world supply. It’s expected to shrink global production to about 2.76 million tons this crop year, down from 3.75 million a year earlier.</p><p>Benchmark prices in Spain, Greece and Italy for extra virgin olive oil reached $4.35 per pound in September, more than triple their level in 2019.</p><p>That’s translated to higher prices for consumers. In Greece, a quart of extra virgin olive oil jumped from around $8 or $9 last year to as much as $15 this year.</p><p>Spanish police said in October that they had retrieved 100 tons of stolen olives in recent weeks. In February, six people were arrested in southern Greece for the theft of 8.8 tons of olive oil in a series of warehouse break-ins over several weeks.</p><p>Farmers around Italy’s southwestern port city of Bari say thieves have become increasingly brazen, snatching tractors and expensive equipment along with olives.</p><p>The regional agricultural association issued a plea for police assistance following reports that 100 olive trees were destroyed or seriously damaged in a single incident last month. Gennaro Sicolo, the association’s leader, called the economic damage “enormous” and said that “farmers must be protected.”</p><p>“This is a felony,” Markou, the grower near Athens, said of the tree-cutting. “You kill your own history here.”</p> </div></div>]]></description>

I am sorry to say there is no such thing as the perfect laptop. There are too many variables at play, too many use cases to handle. All laptops have trade-offs.</p><p>There are, however, some that come close enough to perfect, and System76’s updated Lemur Pro is about as close to the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-linux-laptops/">perfect Linux laptop</a> as you’re likely to get. Part of that is the simple, clean design, but much of it comes from the customization options. System76 has put in a lot of work in the firmware and software that ships with the Lemur Pro.</p><p>Hardware</p><p>System76’s Lemur Pro line is the company’s thin and light laptop. It’s not a gaming rig, nor would it be my top pick for a dedicated video editing station. (That said, I edited a ton of video on it. It’s certainly capable, if not optimized for video.) However, if you need a solid Linux laptop that’s light enough to carry with you everywhere you go, offers a ton of expansion possibilities, and just works, then the Lemur Pro should be almost everything you’re looking for.</p><figure><p><span><p>System76 Lemur Pro Laptop.</p>

At just 2.5 pounds and 0.54 inches thick, you can slide the Lemur Pro in a small bag and forget you’re even carrying it. System76 makes larger, more powerful laptops if you need one, but the Lemur Pro is the ultraportable one in the lineup.</p><p>The latest iteration of the Lemur Pro arrived earlier this year, with new 13th-generation Intel chips inside. The Lemur Pro starts at $1,150 for an Intel i5 machine with 8 GB of RAM and a 256-GB SSD. The model I tested had a 5-GHz Intel Core i7 chip (1355U), 16 GB of RAM, a 250-GB SSD OS drive, and a 1-TB SSD for storage. That brought the price to $1,474.</p><p>The price is reasonable for the hardware (if perhaps a tad high), but part of what you’re paying for is System76’s excellent support for Linux, which is hard to come by in cheaper options. The Lemur Pro base model is also user-upgradeable, so if you already have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-portable-external-storage-drives/#six">a few PCIe SSDs</a> and some RAM lying about, you could upgrade the Lemur yourself.</p><figure><p><span><p>System76 Lemur Pro Laptop.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            

<p><span>2023-11-06</span> Earlier this year in July, Servo received a NLnet grant to enhance several aspects of Servo.</p>

<div>
  <p>We are excited to announce that earlier this year in July, Servo received a <strong><a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/Servo/">NLnet grant</a></strong> to enhance several aspects of Servo. Under this grant, our primary focus is to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete float support in Servo</strong></li>
<li><strong>Support more languages in inline layout</strong></li>
<li><strong>Add initial &lt;table&gt; support</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="floats" tabindex="-1">Floats <a href="#floats">
        <span><i></i></span>
      </a></h2>
<p>Supporting floats in Servo is an ongoing effort since mid-2023. We’ve made significant progress on floats, but there are still some issues that need to be addressed before Servo can boast a fully-compliant implementation of CSS floats.</p>
<p>Our objective is to achieve an average pass rate of over 80% for <code>/css/CSS2/floats/</code> and <code>/css/CSS2/floats-clear/</code>. You can track the results on our <strong><a href="https://wpt.servo.org/">WPT dashboard</a></strong></p>
<p>Last week, we surpassed this for the floats tests, with an 82.2% WPT pass rate:</p>
<p><img src="https://servo.org/img/blog/floats-2023-11-06.png" alt="Image showing web platform test result for floats, that is 82.2%"></p><p>We’re also nearing the milestone for floats-clear, currently at a 73.3% pass rate:</p>
<p><img src="https://servo.org/img/blog/floats-clear-2023-11-06.png" alt="Image showing web platform test result for floats-clear, that is 73.3%"></p><h2 id="more-languages-in-inline-layout" tabindex="-1">More languages in inline layout <a href="#more-languages-in-inline-layout">
        <span><i></i></span>
      </a></h2>
<p>Servo’s layout engine lacks crucial features for rendering languages that don’t use the Latin alphabet. This includes proper font selection, support for right-to-left scripts, and logical properties. Our aim is to improve Servo’s support for displaying a wider variety of content.</p>
<h2 id="initial-%3Ctable%3E-support" tabindex="-1">Initial &lt;table&gt; support <a href="#initial-%3Ctable%3E-support">
        <span><i></i></span>
      </a></h2>
<p>HTML tables are an important and widely used feature. Servo’s new layout engine doesn’t support tables yet, which leads to incorrect layout of many web pages. Under this scope, our main focus is to implement initial support for tables in Servo, so that it can render tables used on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>As we progress and achieve these milestones, we’ll cover them in more detail in subsequent blog posts. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-framer-name="Content" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p>Since we first introduced <!-- --><a href="https://github.com/AbanteAI/mentat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mentat</a>, GPT-4 has been the default model. While Mentat can run with GPT-3.5 or even local models, GPT-4’s higher quality code edits are well worth the extra cost. We are excited to unlock GPT-4 Turbo's full potential — being 2-3x cheaper and having a significantly larger context — but does it match the quality of GPT-4, especially for editing code?<!-- --></p><h2>Benchmarking GPT-4 Turbo</h2><p>To answer this question, we ran both GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo on our <!-- --><a href="https://github.com/AbanteAI/mentat/blob/main/tests/benchmarks/exercism_practice.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exercism benchmarks</a>, compiled from a set of 122 <!-- --><a href="https://exercism.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exercism</a> programming exercises. We ran GPT-4 on each task and gave it two tries to succeed (on the second attempt, it is shown why it failed). GPT-4 ended up solving 86/122, or 70%, of the JavaScript exercises.<!-- --></p><p>Running that same benchmark with GPT-4 Turbo we got 84/122, or 68.8% of the exercises. Slightly worse, but close enough that it could just be statistical noise. But wait! Looking closer at the results there was a significant difference: GPT-4 solved 76 on the first try and only an additional 10 on the second attempt, while GPT-4 Turbo only solved 56 on the first try and solved an additional 28 on the second attempt.</p><h2>Interpreting Results</h2><p>Why would GPT-4 Turbo solve fewer tasks on the first attempt? We examined individual exercises and the code it wrote for them and found that it often wrote reasonable solutions but failed on the first attempt due to unclear or ambiguous instructions. But then how does GPT-4 solve them? Our theory was that GPT-4 had substantially memorized the Exercism training tasks, but that when GPT-4 was downsized (most likely through distillation) to GPT-4 Turbo, it lost some of this raw memorization capability.</p><p>We designed a test for this theory: we reran the benchmarks without showing the models the instructions to each exercise. Instead, we just told them that they were Exercism exercises, and gave them the exercise names and function stubs. This is not enough to solve the problem unless the model has it memorized. Due to rate limits on GPT-4 Turbo, we only ran the first 40 exercises. GPT-4 solved 23/40, or 57.5%, on the first try and an additional 5 on the second try. GPT-4 Turbo, on the other hand, only solved 12/40, or 30%, on the first try and an additional 11 on the second try. We interpret this as confirming that GPT-4 has more of the exercises memorized than GPT-4-Turbo.</p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,aoa9JDugtTsDNSAVzXKgW8vq1o.png" data-framer-height="878" data-framer-width="1330" height="439" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/aoa9JDugtTsDNSAVzXKgW8vq1o.png" width="665"></p><p>Our results seem similar to <!-- --><a href="https://twitter.com/wangzjeff/status/1721934560919994823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this finding</a>:<!-- --></p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,xOoj8r4n0N1TQ4Px32I4PlhECz8.png" data-framer-height="2584" data-framer-width="1262" height="1292" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/xOoj8r4n0N1TQ4Px32I4PlhECz8.png" width="631"></p><p>Although the author OCR’ed the SAT questions and believes that they weren’t in the training data, we believe it’s fairly likely that these questions – and definitely some incredibly similar questions – ended up in the training data at some point, making the drop in GPT-4 Turbo's measured performance hard to interpret.</p><h2>Future Benchmarks</h2><p>Benchmarks derived from content in GPT’s training data are still valuable for determining how good GPT is at responding in the correct edit format, as well as comparing fine-tuned models to each other. But these results make it pretty clear that they aren’t an accurate test for comparing models trained on separate datasets or distilled models – which is what we suspect GPT-4 Turbo is.</p><p>These results emphasize the need for better benchmarks, something we've already begun building for Mentat: real world, realistic coding tasks based on recent commits to open source repositories that were made after the training cutoff. Although no benchmark will ever be perfect, we are confident that these improvements will help us gauge the relative accuracy of different models in the future.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Behind closed doors, the spy had turned whistleblower.</p><h2 id="a-historic-scandal">A ‘historic scandal’?</h2><p>In August 2020, “all hell broke loose”, a former intelligence official recalls. The independent watchdog, led by a senior judge, revealed in a brief statement that it had obtained a large amount of material from a whistleblower and listed a series of incendiary allegations about how the DDIS spy service was operating.</p><p>Among its findings, the body warned there were “risks in the central part of DDIS’s intelligence gathering capabilities that unauthorised intelligence has been gathered on Danish citizens”. The statement was not explicit, but according to former officials this was a reference to data collected under the NSA cable-tapping programme.</p><p>The fallout was immediate. Findsen and several colleagues at the agency were placed on indefinite leave. “It was not a nice situation,” says Findsen.</p><p>The media branded the findings a “historic scandal” and suggested the spies were working outside the law, effectively acting as a “state within a state”. As one front page read: “Spy chiefs accused of illegal surveillance”.</p><figure id="b914bf86-8516-44bc-9746-6c12a5c1f0bb" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-5"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Lars Findsen in Copenhagen in December 2017" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="266.9261615044248" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Lars Findsen in Copenhagen in December 2017.</span> Photograph: Liselotte Sabroe/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Responding to the coverage, Frederiksen, who had left the defence ministry a year earlier, defended Findsen and the other officials. “This is what triggered my involvement in this case,” Frederiksen says. “I knew them as loyal employees, dedicated and honest people, who were unjustly labelled as having done something wrong.”</p><p>In September 2020, Frederiksen publicly criticised the decision to publish the watchdog’s findings and, crucially, while defending the DDIS employees he appeared to provide the first on-the-record confirmation of the existence of the cable-tapping deal with the US glimpsed in the Snowden leaks.</p><p>Frederiksen acknowledged the arrangement again in subsequent interviews and went further in another media appearance in December 2021. “I’m going to be careful what I can say, otherwise I’ll risk a prison sentence,” he said on live TV before remarking that Denmark “greatly benefits from being allied with the NSA”.</p><p>Shortly before the interview, a government-appointed panel of judges had rejected the independent watchdog’s findings, seemingly drawing a line under the controversy.</p><p>Behind the scenes, there had been a remarkable twist. People close to Findsen were suddenly unable to contact him. It was as though he’d disappeared.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-42">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-42" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>What only a few in Denmark knew was that, days earlier, a group of armed officers had stopped the spy chief at Copenhagen airport and, before anyone could notice, quietly arrested him.</p><h2 id="microphones-were-everywhere">‘Microphones were everywhere’</h2><p>Speaking to the Guardian as he prepares for trial, Findsen appears relaxed, though there is undoubtedly a quiet anger as he describes the events of the past three years.</p><p>Released from prison in February 2022 after 70 days in custody, Findsen technically remains head of the spy agency DDIS, albeit suspended and on two-thirds salary. He says he cannot be certain he’s not still under surveillance.</p><p>Suddenly finding himself in prison, he says, was strange. “There were no other spy chiefs,” he jokes. He says he established good relations with the other prisoners. “They were much younger than me. They were there for things like drugs, arms dealing and kidnapping, so it was a different environment for me.”</p><p>Findsen’s close ties to the domestic service, which he previously ran after 9/11, added to the sense of betrayal when he came to understand colleagues had authorised a surveillance operation against him, which he believes lasted for more than a year.</p><p>“The microphones were everywhere,” he says, not just in his kitchen and living rooms, but in his car and holiday home.</p><p>In custody, he was shown the surveillance reports being used as evidence against him. His daily family life was described in the kind of documents he’d spent a career in intelligence reading. “I was talking to my children when they came back from school and things like that.”</p><p>Perhaps unusually for a spy chief, Findsen had developed relationships with journalists, on which he’s believed to have relied to counter negative stories about DDIS once sent home in 2020 after the watchdog’s damning statement.</p><p>Prosecutors allege that Findsen shared state secrets with two reporters, as well as close relatives, his girlfriend and an old friend. Much about the case remains shrouded in secrecy but Danish journalists reported last year that prosecutors allege Findsen’s conversations related to the NSA cable-tapping partnership.</p><p>In April 2021, for example, he is alleged to have spoken to his 84-year-old mother about the whistleblower who raised the alarm about the deal. Many of the conversations, it is alleged, risked causing “significant damage” to Denmark’s “security and relations with foreign powers”. Unable to discuss the specific charges, Findsen describes them as “crazy and ridiculous”.</p><p>As for the whistleblower, he remains an elusive protagonist at the heart of the affair. Now in his 40s, he’s never spoken publicly. He no longer works at DDIS and appears to be living a quiet life in the countryside running a small cybersecurity business. He did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment.</p><h2 id="state-secrets-in-the-public-domain">State secrets in the public domain</h2><p>In December 2021, a week after the Frederiksen, the former minister, mentioned the NSA cable-tapping deal on television, police officers turned up at his home. Standing outside the thatched fisherman’s cottage, the officers informed the 76-year-old he’d been charged with treason.</p><p>The charges have been brought under a section of the criminal code last used against an East German Stasi agent in 1979. It is the same law that is being used in Findsen’s case but Frederiksen is accused of disclosing classified information in media appearances rather than in private. He denies revealing state secrets in the interviews, since the information he shared – which he can no longer repeat – had been in the public domain since the 2014 Snowden story.</p><figure id="6dc0ebcf-05ca-44a6-ae3e-c5d48f382bd8" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-6"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Edward Snowden" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed how European countries such as Denmark help facilitate the US’s globe-spanning electronic surveillance.</span> Illustration: Joseph Pierce/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>“The present government is of the opinion that a secret is a secret,” Frederiksen says. “It might have been described in the newspapers, but they still say it’s a secret.” In court, the trial is expected to turn on whether an open secret can still be a state secret.</p><p>The paradox in both cases is that Findsen and Frederiksen, according to people who know them, are staunch believers in DDIS’s US partnership and proud of its special relationship with the NSA.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p><span>Y</span>esterday I was rudely summoned away from a beautiful autumn day of wild foraging by The King.</p>
<p>Specifically, I was given a heads-up about one of the bills which would be in yesterday’s King’s Speech – the first of the King’s reign, and the first and only one of Rishi Sunak’s time in office.</p>
<p>The bill in question is the Investigatory Powers (Amendment) Bill, the outcome of a consultation held over the summer, which I obviously missed being out of work. (Neil Brown <a href="https://decoded.legal/blog/2023/06/consultation-on-changes-to-the-investigatory-powers-act-2016s-notices-regime/">did not miss one word</a> from his tech lawyer perspective, and TechUK <a href="https://www.techuk.org/resource/as-the-government-reviews-the-investigatory-powers-act-s-notices-regime-it-is-vital-we-maintain-proper-checks-and-balances-to-protect-privacy.html">were equally diligent</a> from the service provider perspective.) There was also an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-review-of-the-investigatory-powers-act-2016--2">independent review</a> which requires prior knowledge of the IPA.</p>
<p>The problem is that aside from the rather legalistic topics dealt with in the summer consultation and independent review, some of which do indeed have merit, the politicians have stepped in.</p>

<p>What we learned yesterday is that the Bill aims to</p>
<ul>
<li>Force technology companies to inform the Home Office in advance of security and privacy features they want to add, including encryption, and force them to disable features which the government objects to;</li>
<li>Increase the power of the Home Office to force non-UK companies to comply with changes it wants them to make to security features without the right to appeal; and</li>
<li>Require companies to comply with a notice before any requested review is completed, depriving companies of the opportunity to seek a review of the appropriateness of notices before being obliged to follow them.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://x.com/katebevan/status/1721861707868324062?s=20">The adoring public was not impressed</a>.</p>
<p>And yes, this all dovetails with the Online Safety Act, in ways I will make no attempt to parse out over morning coffee.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/654a21952f045e001214dcd7/The_King_s_Speech_background_briefing_notes.pdf">official speech souvenir handout</a> noted how these asks will be framed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make changes to the bulk personal dataset regime to ensure the UK’s intelligence agencies can more effectively make use of less sensitive data, which is already widely available to the public, subject to appropriate safeguards</li>
<li>Expand the oversight regime to support the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to effectively carry out their role, including putting a number of their functions on a statutory basis. This will maintain the robust, transparent, and world-leading safeguards in the regime.</li>
<li>Reform the notices regime, to help the UK anticipate the risk to public safety posed by the rolling out of technology by multinational companies that precludes lawful access to data. This will reduce the risk of the most serious offences such as child sexual exploitation and abuse or terrorism</li>
<li>Update the conditions for use of Internet Connections Records to ensure that these can be used effectively to detect the most serious types of criminal activity and national security threats, underpinned by a robust independent oversight regime</li>
<li>Increase the resilience of the warrantry authorisation processes to ensure the security and intelligence agencies, as well as the National Crime Agency, can always get lawful access to information in a timely way so that they can respond to the most serious national security and organised crime threats.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ve probably been reading this blog long enough to know how the sausage gets made. These asks, which go well beyond the hair-splitting legal minutiae of the summer consultation and of the independent review, were asks thrown in by the authoritarian wing of the Home Office, who are obviously still enraged that they failed to regulate the entire open internet around Meta via the <a href="https://webdevlaw.uk/2023/04/17/greatest-hits-b-sides-and-unfinished-demo-tracks-or-all-my-blogging-on-the-online-safety-bill/">Online Safety Act</a>.</p>
<p>And let’s state the obvious here: that’s what this is bill about.</p>
<p><em>While we don’t know what is actually in the bill, as it doesn’t exist yet</em>, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b9f92f62-9895-4ff4-9e4a-659d217dc9af">it’s already clear</a> that this is the latest salvo in government’s <a href="https://webdevlaw.uk/2020/12/09/facebook-derangement-syndrome/">Meta Vendetta</a>.</p>
<p>You would think that they’d have learned their lesson from spending six years crafting world-leadingly bad legislation around the obsession with getting one company, its suite of products, and its executive leadership (which just happens to include their former political enemy number one).</p>
<p>But this is Conservative digital policymaking we’re talking about. <a href="https://x.com/WebDevLaw/status/1721066591641592255?s=20">It learns nothing from its mistakes</a>.</p>
<p>So without knowing the contents, one thing’s for sure: the sharpest minds on these issues across law, policy, tech, and digital rights need to saddle up for yet another year of going into government meetings, in good faith, with notes prepared and talking points honed, so that they can be shouted at for 58 minutes about Meta, and leave with nothing accomplished.</p>
<p>Plus ça change.</p>
<p>And while everyone obviously needs to show up for this Bill, and yes that includes the people who don’t show up for anything because “politics”, it’s also worth remembering the <em>actual</em> politics of the thing.</p>
<p>First, we will be having a general election no later than January 2025, one which is going to wipe the Conservatives into the third party. That’s why the King’s Speech was so strikingly <em>meh</em>: it’s all tinkering and technocracy to fill twelve months of time, as opposed to the post-EU revolutionary bombast we’ve seen in recent years. And while the public knows full well that the Conservatives are openly shitting the bed on their way out, knowing it will be someone else’s responsibility to change the sheets, they’re not dumb. And certainly not about a bill like this.</p>
<p>Second, while the Home Office has been a rogue outfit for a long time, it’s currently headed by a racist lunatic who, by all accounts from the Westminster gossip chain, is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-67344806">deliberately trolling the town</a> <em>so that</em> she can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/08/tory-insiders-suggest-suella-braverman-trying-to-get-sacked">get sacked</a> <em>so that</em> she can work up her leadership challenge to Rishi Sunak. (Yes, there are people who dream of a Braverman-led UK and a Trump-led US. They work hard. They’re working right now.) And what better way to gum up the works for your political rival, who’s riding high on the global AI summit he led last week, than by introducing a law that would <a href="https://x.com/marypcbuk/status/1722003706332209653?s=20">make it impossible</a> for anyone anywhere to do any tech of any kind?</p>
<p>By the way, if you think it isn’t possible for the integrity of the open internet to fall victim, via bad legislation, to backstabbing Tory power grabs, what do you think I’ve been working on since 2016? Like I said. This garbage is what the sharpest tech policy minds in the UK have been dealing with for seven years. Not the work they were born to do.</p>
<p>So while we wait for the IP(A)A to be published, let’s all read up, form up, strategise, and get this right, so that what’s good about the IP(A)A gets sorted and what’s bad about the IP(A)A gets put in the bin. Quickly, cleanly, and definitively.</p>
<p>Look on the bright side: you’ve just had six years of practice.</p>
<p>An aside because fuck yeah I am going there: the IPA and IPCO were one of four disparate policy portfolios I held in my brief stint in a digital rights organisation, on a salary of £28k per year, a salary which in the end they could not sustain for an entire year. Imagine getting up to speed with all of that, above, back to front, including building a relationship with IPCO all for nothing, on a few hours a month, for net pay of less than £500 pcm for that work, in a work environment which was, as they say, suboptimal. It is well past time to have the ugly conversation about how the resourcing and leadership of UK digital rights organisations is failing to contribute to the solution and, indeed, is now becoming part of the problem. </p>

        <p>Don’t want a big old bloated multi-kilobyte executable with a data segment, but you do need to store some data?</p>
<p>I "discovered" this while working on <a href="https://ratfactor.com/meow5/">Meow5</a>.</p>
<p>One of my biggest challenges has been storing strings in a position-independent
way. I’ve considered a Global Offset Table (GOT), but it seems like <strong>way</strong> more
machinery than I need. And though I went well
<a href="https://ratfactor.com/repos/mez/">out of my way</a>
to figure out how to make multi-segment ELF executables, I just couldn’t bear
to export a "huge" 2kb+ padded file with the proper alignment.</p>
<p>So I was determined to store strings in a Forth-style manner - embedding them with the executable code and jumping over them.</p>
<p>To do this was going to be a lot of painful trial-and-error to get the exact right opcodes compiled in place to push the address of the string on the stack followed by a <code>jmp</code> instruction to hop over the string (gotta know the length first, then come back and write the instruction).</p>
<p>The thing that makes this <em>extra</em> hard is that 32-bit i386 doesn’t have an instruction for getting the value of the instruction pointer (EIP) directly. (x86_64 added this later.)</p>
<p>But I realized something: there <em>is</em> an instruction that pushes the following address on the stack and then jumps to a location. It’s <code>call</code>.</p>
<p>So I made a little stand-alone NASM assembly "Hello world" test as a proof of concept. I realized I can even get the length of the string by subtracting the offset of my call’d label from the return address:</p>
<div>
<pre>global _start
_start:

    ; call pushes the next address on the stack
    ; so we could "return" there
    call print

    ; this gets jumped over, but we've got the address!
    db `Hello World!\n`

print:
    ; Print with Linux SYS_WRITE
    ; pop the address from the stack to ecx
    pop ecx        ; string address
    mov edx, print ; label address
    sub edx, ecx   ; length of string!
    mov     ebx, 1 ; STDOUT
    mov     eax, 4 ; SYS_WRITE
    int     80h

    ; Exit with Linux SYS_EXIT
    mov ebx, 0 ; return status
    mov eax, 1 ; SYS_EXIT
    int 80h    ; kernel syscall</pre>
</div>
<p>Let’s build it:</p>
<div>
<pre>$ nasm -f elf32 -o hello.o hello.asm
$ ld -m elf_i386 -n hello.o -o hello</pre>
</div>
<p>Without a data segment, this executable is truly tiny, just 532 bytes.</p>
<div>
<pre>$ ls -l hello
-rwxr-xr-x 1 dave users 532 Nov  8 20:58 hello</pre>
</div>
<p>And does it work?</p>

<p>Of course. :-)</p>
<p>I’m sure this trick is well-known and has a name and everything, but it’s new
to me.</p>
<p>I was really pleased with how nice and neat it turned out and it’s definitely
going straight into Meow5, which should allow me to finally finish that
project.</p>

<p>When Anna Carin Elf arrived at her workplace in Gothenburg, she immediately realized something was not right. She works at a library, and she was greeted by several visitors, just like any other day. But this was not any other day — the library was supposed to be closed.</p>



<p>“They were surprised. They thought it was a bit empty,” <a href="https://www.dn.se/sverige/biblioteket-var-stangt-lanade-bocker-anda/">she says</a>. “The people in the library behaved as usual. Many were sitting reading newspapers, some families were in the children’s section and others were searching for books on the computer.”</p>




<p>The library was supposed to be closed for All Saints Day — a celebration sometimes also called <a href="https://www.zmescience.com/feature-post/culture/culture-society/a-short-history-of-halloween/">All Hallows Day, the precursor of Halloween</a>. But the library staff had forgotten to close a door. So people came in, thinking the library was open. Some visitors <a href="https://www.gp.se/kultur/kultur/arvid-var-en-av-hundratals-inne-p%C3%A5-ol%C3%A5sta-biblioteket-1.114743762">realized the library</a> was technically closed and went home, but others did not.</p><!-- Tag ID: zmescience_300x250_InContent -->
 





<p>As people were coming in and out of the library, one librarian (Elf) walked by and noticed the people using the library. She realized what was happening, called her manager and a colleague, and then announced that the library was closing. The visitors calmly folded their books closed and left. </p>



<p>But some left with books.</p><!-- Tag ID: zmescience_300x250_InContent_3 -->




<p>During that day, 446 people visited the city library. A total of 246 books were borrowed. To date, all the books have been returned.</p>



<p>Through a door mistakenly left ajar, the people of Gothenburg demonstrated the power of community and the value they place on the guardianship of shared resources. It was a quiet revolution, an act of civil responsibility that spoke volumes, reaffirming the notion that a library is much more than a building; it is a cornerstone of community, education, and trust.</p>



<p>The City Library published a loving post, thanking people for their well-behaved visits. “Thank you for Saturday, dear Gothenburg,” the library’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/859585461/gothenburg-public-library/">post read</a>.</p><!-- Tag ID: zmescience_300x250_InContent -->








<p>“It felt good that everyone behaved exactly as usual, they borrowed books, read the newspaper and so on… the citizens of Gothenburg take care of their library. There is obviously a desire to be there,” said one of the library’s visitors, Arvid Jadenius, <a href="https://www.gp.se/kultur/kultur/arvid-var-en-av-hundratals-inne-p%C3%A5-ol%C3%A5sta-biblioteket-1.114743762">for a local publisher</a>.</p>



<p>In a world often marred by headlines of chaos and discord, the story of Gothenburg’s library stands as a testament to the inherent good in society — and shows that libraries truly are one of the beacons of our society. It seems almost poetic that on All Saints Day, a day of remembrance and reverence, the citizens of Gothenburg would unknowingly participate in an act of collective respect and honor for their beloved library.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-elid="2666077708" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductor" data-authors="Charles Q. Choi" data-headline="Researchers Uncover the Fastest Semiconductor Yet" data-page-title="Researchers Uncover the Fastest Semiconductor Yet - IEEE Spectrum"><p>Scientists have discovered what they say is the fastest and most efficient semiconductor yet. Although the new material is made using one of the rarest elements on Earth, the researchers suggest counterparts made from more abundant materials may be discovered that operate comparably fast.<br></p><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/semiconductors/">Semiconductors</a> underpin virtually all modern electronics. However, as commonplace as they’ve become, semiconductors still face constraints when it comes to their speed.</p><p>One reason for these speed limits has to do with atomic vibrations, which travel as quasiparticles known as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cryogenics" target="_self">phonons</a> within solid materials. Phonons can scatter the particles that carry energy and information around electronics. These are typically electrons, but are sometimes more exotic particles, such as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/new-magnet" target="_self">excitons</a> (electrons bound to their positively charged quasiparticle counterparts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_hole" target="_blank">electron holes</a>).</p><p>In a new study that overcame the problems that phonons can cause, researchers experimented with a semiconductor made out of Re6Se8Cl2—a molecule built out of rhenium, selenium, and chlorine. The semiconductor’s atoms form clusters called “superatoms” that each behave like one big atom, but with different properties than the elements used to build them. Each cluster consists of an octahedron made of six rhenium atoms nestled within a cube made of eight selenium atoms, with a chlorine atom on the top and bottom of the cluster.</p><p>“Now that we know what structural and electronic properties are needed...there is good likelihood that we will find earth-abundant alternatives to this rhenium-based material.” <strong>—Milan Delor, Columbia University</strong></p><p>When excitons come in contact with phonons in Re6Se8Cl2, instead of scattering, they actually bind together, forming new quasiparticles called acoustic exciton-polarons. These quasiparticles are capable of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/molybdenumdisulfide-2d-transistors-go-ballistic" target="_self">ballistic</a>, or scatter-free, flow.</p><p>In experiments at room temperature, acoustic exciton-polarons in Re6Se8Cl2 moved twice as fast as electrons in silicon. This is the first material in which anyone has detected sustained room-temperature ballistic exciton movement.</p><p>Electrons in semiconductors usually scatter after traveling just nanometers, on a timescale measured in femtoseconds. In contrast, the acoustic exciton-polarons in Re6Se8Cl2 successfully crossed several micrometers (about 3 orders of magnitude farther) over the course of a nanosecond (about 6 orders of magnitude longer). Given that polarons can last for about 11 nanoseconds, the scientists think that acoustic exciton-polarons could cover more than 25 micrometers before scattering.</p><p>These quasiparticles are controlled by light rather than by an electric current. This means processing speeds in devices based on them could reach femtoseconds, a million times as fast as the speeds achievable with current gigahertz electronics.</p><p>The researchers did not originally test Re6Se8Cl2 thinking it would prove a new and improved semiconductor. Instead, they were testing lab microscopes on a material they had thought should not have conducted much of anything. They ended up seeing the fastest semiconductor they had ever seen, says study senior author Milan Delor, a physical chemist at Columbia University in New York City.</p><p>After two years of work, Delor and his colleagues now believe they understand why Re6Se8Cl2 displays such extraordinary behavior. As it turns out, excitons in this semiconductor move very slowly compared to electrons in silicon. However, this means that the excitons can pair up with equally slow-moving phonons. The resulting quasiparticles are “heavy,” meaning they move slowly but steadily. In contrast, electrons are “light,” meaning they bounce around too much to actually travel very far or fast in the end.</p><p>Re6Se8Cl2 is also, along with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/solid-state-battery-no-anode" target="_self">graphite</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/memristor-ai-chip-hybrid" target="_self">hexagonal boron nitride</a>, what’s called a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/phonon" target="_self">van der Waals material</a>. These materials are made of stacked films of smooth, atomically thin layers held together by weak electric forces known as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-microscope-nanoscale-mri" target="_self">van der Waals interactions</a>, the same forces that often make adhesive tapes sticky. Previous research has suggested that when atom-thin sheets of different van der Waals materials are placed on top of each other to form so-called <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/vanderwaals-heterostructure-flash-memory-5000-times-speedier" target="_self">heterostructures</a>, novel hybrid properties can emerge.</p><p>One major problem that Re6Se8Cl2 faces is that rhenium is one of the rarest elements on Earth. This makes Re6Se8Cl2 very expensive and unlikely to ever make its way into a commercial product.</p><p>However, Re6Se8Cl2 belongs to a family of superatomic semiconductors that share structural and electronic properties. Many of these materials are made of more abundant elements. This includes a recently discovered all-carbon material named<strong></strong><a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/graphullerene-exists" target="_blank">graphullerene</a>, which resembles balls of carbon arranged in sheets.</p><p>“Now that we know what structural and electronic properties are needed to achieve the new transport regime discovered in this work, there is good likelihood that we will find earth-abundant alternatives to this rhenium-based material that also show impressive transport properties,” Delor says.</p><p>All in all, the researchers suggest acoustic exciton-polarons “could be a general way to achieve long-range energy flow in different materials that traditionally would not be expected to show good transport properties,” Delor says. “It’s a surprising finding that we’re looking forward to applying to more systems.”</p><p>Another caveat of this work is that it relies on excitons instead of electrons. “Although excitons carry information and energy just like electrons, they are not necessarily compatible with current hardware used in the semiconductor industry,” Delor says. Therefore, the applications for these semiconductors “would likely be different than those for traditional semiconductors.”</p><p>Potential devices made from these semiconductors may include “ballistic transistors” that use excitons instead of electrons. These could serve as very efficient light detectors, or find use in computing to reduce energy losses and increase performance, Delor says.</p><p>The scientists detailed <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf2698" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their findings</a> in the 27 October issue of the journal <em>Science</em>.</p><div><p>From Your Site Articles</p><ul><li><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cosmic-ray-failures-of-power-semiconductor-devices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic Ray Failures of Power Semiconductor Devices - IEEE ... ›</a></li><li><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chips-act-workforce-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Universities Are Building a New Semiconductor Workforce ... ›</a></li><li><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/gallium-oxide-the-supercharged-semiconductor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallium Oxide: The Supercharged Semiconductor - IEEE Spectrum ›</a></li><li><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/best-semiconductor-boron-arsenide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is This the Best Semiconductor Ever Found? ›</a></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Sony has announced the Alpha 9 Mark III, the world's first full-frame camera with a global shutter. It can shoot at 120 fps with no blackout and a maximum shutter speed of 1/80,000 sec.</p>
<p>It's a 24.6MP camera that Sony says doesn't compromise on ISO performance or dynamic range. The camera has a base ISO of 250 though, which is likely to mean that its DR is comparable to existing cameras at that sensitivity setting. The global shutter means photos with zero distortion of movement. It promises 8EV of in-body stabilization.</p>

<p>The a9 III is built around the latest Bionz XR processors, giving eight times as much processing power as was present in the a9 II.</p>
<p>The a9 III can shoot 120 fps with full AF conducting calculations between each shot. It can continue this for 1.6secs of 14-bit Raw files: 192 frames and 6GB/s. It can pre-buffer for up to 1 sec, giving a preemptive 120 frames of pre-capture. The camera includes a 'Speed Boost' custom button to prompt the camera to jump from a slower rate up to 120 fps.</p>
<p>Sony has published a list of lenses able to shoot at 120fps with full AE and AF in AF-C mode.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/7271416294/IMG_7314.jpeg" target="article-7271416294"><img data-thumbnail-height="0" data-thumbnail-width="590" height="443" src="https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/7271416294/IMG_7314.jpeg" width="590" data-filename="IMG_7314.jpeg" srcset="https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/7271416294/IMG_7314.jpeg 2x"></a></p>
<p>CMOS sensors with a global shutter have been available for several years but haven't been able to offer as much dynamic range as conventional, progressive-scan designs. The emergence of Stacked CMOS technology allows the photo diode and readout circuitry to be built as separate layers, providing more space for the readout circuitry without cutting so much into the sensor's capacity to store electrons (which can limit dynamic range).</p>
<p>Sony isn't giving detail of the sensor but it appears to be a two-layer design, not the <a href="https://www.sony-semicon.com/en/news/2021/2021121601.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">three-layer approach</a> being used for some smartphone sensors. This might explain the base ISO of 250, which will ultimately limit the camera's maximum dynamic range. Sony isn't quoting a DR figure for the camera. Unlike the original a9, the a9 III includes the ability to shoot in S-Log3, with base ISO jumping by 3 stops to ISO 2000, to facilitate its greater degree of highlight capture.</p>
<p>The global shutter means the a9 III can sync at up to 1/80,000 sec and eliminates the need for High Speed Sync, and allows this feature with third-party flashes. It also means there's no risk of banding from artificial lights, but the camera has an 'Anti-Flicker' mode that syncs the shutter with the bright point in the light's cycle, to avoid inconsistent exposure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/7271416294/IMG_7316_1.jpeg" target="article-7271416294"><img data-thumbnail-height="0" data-thumbnail-width="590" height="443" src="https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/7271416294/IMG_7316_1.jpeg" width="590" data-filename="IMG_7316_1.jpeg" srcset="https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/7271416294/IMG_7316_1.jpeg 2x"></a></p>
<p>It's rated to focus down to -5EV with an F1.8 aperture lens. It adds smaller AF points, alongside Sony's subject recognition modes.</p>
<p>On the video side, it can shoot 4K/60p taken from 6K capture and 4K/120p without any crop. It includes options such as 10-bit 4:2:2 capture, the S-Cinetone profile and '16-bit' Raw video output over HDMI.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/7271416294/DSC07594.jpeg" target="article-7271416294"><img data-thumbnail-height="0" data-thumbnail-width="590" height="395" src="https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/7271416294/DSC07594.jpeg" width="590" data-filename="DSC07594.jpeg" srcset="https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/7271416294/DSC07594.jpeg 2x"></a></p>
<p>The a9 III has a 2M-dot 3.2" rear screen with full articulation and a tilt-out cradle. It's the same setup as the a7R V and includes an LCD panel which covers the DCI P3 color gamut. It features a 9.44M dot OLED viewfinder with 0.9x magnification. It can run at full resolution at 120fps or with a reduced resolution at 240fps.</p>
<p>Sony says it's moved the shutter button to improve ergonomics, as well as adding a fifth function button to the front of the camera. The difference is immediately apparent when you pick the camera up: the grip tilts your hand backwards slightly, giving a comfortable grip and putting the shutter button immediately under your finger.</p>
<p>The optional battery grip's ergonomics have also been reworked and the battery performance boosted by 15% by treating the two included batteries as a single entity, rather than discharging one and then the other.</p>

<p>The a9 III will be available from Spring 2024 at a recommended price of $5999.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="global">What is a global shutter?</h3>
<p>Global shutter is a method of ending an exposure where all the image data is captured simultaneously. This is distinct from most existing shutter systems (electronic and mechanical) that start and end progressively: working their way across the sensor.</p>
<p>There are multiple benefits to such a system, with the most obvious being the elimination of the rolling shutter distortion effect often seen on video and with slow electronic (progressive) shutters.</p>
<p>But another major benefit is that a global shutter can sync with flash at almost any shutter speed. With global shutter it's the duration of the flash burst that becomes the limitation, rather than the length of time it takes to close the shutter (which in turn dictates the shortest period where the whole sensor is exposed). Sony says the a9 III can sync at all shutter speeds (all the way up to 1/80,000 sec).</p>
<p>A global shutter also eliminates the banding that can occur with progressive shutters under flickering lights. Because the image is all captured at exactly the same moment, you don't capture different parts of a light's flicker cycle in different parts of the image. You might capture an image of an LED sign board refreshing, if you use a very high shutter speed, but that's an issue with the LEDs, not the camera, which is accurately capturing a single moment in time.</p>
</div>
<p>It also says it will be introducing firmware updates to the a7S III and the a1, adding features such as breathing compensation. The a7S III will also gain DCI 4K capture. Sony says there will also be a firmware update for the a9 III, adding the ability to continuously shoot with shutter speeds at up to 1/80,000 sec.</p>
<p>All three cameras will also add <a href="https://c2pa.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">C2PA authentication</a> metadata. C2PA is a combination of the efforts of the Content Authentication Initiative and the separate Project Origin initiative.</p>

<h2>Sony Electronics Releases the Alpha 9 III; the World's First Full-Frame Camera with a Global Shutter System<span>i </span></h2>
<p><em>The next-generation Alpha 9 III captures all decisive moments with up to 120 frames per second high-speed shooting, distortion-free and blackout-free images, and flash sync at all shooting speeds</em></p>

<p>SAN DIEGO- Nov. 7, 2023 – Sony Electronics today introduced the Alpha 9 III camera equipped with the world's firsti full-frame global shutter image sensor. ​</p>
<p>The newly developed global shutter image sensor exposes and reads all pixels simultaneously, unlike a rolling shutter sensor that records images sequentially from the top row of pixels to the bottom. The impressive global shutter full-frame image sensor enables the camera to shoot at burst speeds up to 120 frames per second with no rolling shutter distortion or camera blackout. This innovative sensor is combined with Sony’s most advanced AF (autofocus) system to date - boasting AI autofocus with up to 120 times AF/AE focus calculations per second. With the added ability to sync flash at all shooting speeds, the Alpha 9 III opens up a new world of possibilities for professional photographers to capture every decisive moment.</p>
<p>“The Alpha 9 III full-frame camera is a landmark achievement for the industry,” says Yang Cheng, Vice President, Imaging Solutions, Sony Electronics. “Designed with the needs and demands of professional photographers in mind, every single update to this camera – from the sensor to even the size to the button layouts and menu functions – has been made to address specific input and feedback from our community. We have listened and are thrilled to bring the new capabilities of the Alpha 9 III to market---capabilities which allow photographers to capture things they’ve never been able to capture before.” Cheng continued, “For professionals everywhere, they can achieve even more dynamic expressions when the Alpha 9 III is combined with our rich lineup of lenses, in particular with the new 300mm F2.8 G Master OSS – the world’s lightestii large-aperture telephoto lens.”</p>
<h3>Features of the Alpha 9 III Full-Frame Camera</h3>
<h3>A New Dimension of Still Image Performance Created by the World's First<span>i</span> Global Shutter Image Sensor</h3>
<p>The Alpha 9 III is equipped with the newly developed, world's first<span>i</span> global shutter full frame stacked CMOS image sensor with approximately 24.6 effective megapixels<span>iii</span> and built-in memory. Combined with the latest image processing engine BIONZ XR®, the Alpha 9 III achieves blackout-free Continuous Shooting Speed with AF/AE tracking<span>iv</span> of up to approximately 120 fps<span>iv</span>. The Alpha 9 III is supplied with high-density focal plane phase detection AF. A designated AI processing unit uses Real-time Recognition AF to recognize a wide variety of subjects with high precision. By combining high-speed performance of up to 120 fps with highly accurate subject recognition performance, it is possible to easily photograph scenes and moments that cannot be seen with the naked eye<span>iv</span>. The AI processing unit in the Alpha 9 III supports movies as well as still photography with accurate subject form and movement recognition. The Real-time Recognition AF and Real-time Tracking provide a significant improvement in human eye recognition performance, allowing the camera to automatically recognize, track, and focus on the eyes of a specified subject<span>v</span>. The Alpha 9 III is equipped with 8.0 stops<span>vi</span> of optical 5-axis in-body image stabilization, allowing for high-quality image rendering.</p>
<p>Shutter speed is freed from the limitations of conventional mechanical shutter image sensors and achieves a maximum shutter speed of 1/80,000 second (1/16,000 second during continuous shooting)<span>vii</span>, making it possible to capture at high speed without any distortion. When a compatible Sony flash<span>viii</span> is attached, such as the HVL-F60RM2 and HVL-F46RM (sold separately), it is possible to synchronize the flash and take pictures at all shutter speeds up to 1/80,000 second<span>vii</span>. Previously, if the user released the shutter at a speed faster than the flash's synchronization speed, the amount of light would drop sharply, but with the full-speed flash synchronization function, it’s now possible to photograph scenes that could not be easily captured with conventional technology. Also, when shooting stills or movies under LED lighting, the Hi Frequency Flicker function can significantly reduce high-frequency flicker problems by allowing the shutter speed to be finely adjusted to match the flicker frequency while viewing the monitor.</p>
<p>The Alpha 9 III features selectable release lag modes which allows the user to prioritize release lag or viewfinder/monitor display<span>ix</span>. The newly developed Pre-Capture function allows the camera to continuously record up to one second before the shutter is released, making it easy to capture moments that would otherwise be missed. When selected, the Continuous Shooting Speed Boost<span>x</span> function allows for the user to change to a faster, preset speed set by the user at any time during shooting, and enhanced burst stamina ensures that important moments are reliably captured due to a large buffer memory and increased overall system speed allow up to approximately 390 Fine JPEG images<span>xi</span> to be captured in one continuous 30 fps<span>xii</span> burst.</p>
<p>Customizable focus areas have been expanded to include from XS to XL in addition to the previous S, M, and L sizes. The Preset Focus/Zoom function allows preset focus and zoom settings to be memorized in the camera for quick recall when needed<span>xiii</span>. In addition to the existing custom white balance frame size, the user can now select other sizes as needed which allows for fine white balance adjustment after an image has been composed. The Alpha 9 III has upgraded features such as the latest AF algorithms to achieve high AF precision down to light levels as low as EV-5 in AF-S mode (ISO 100 equivalent, F2.0 lens), AF tracking for continuous shooting at F22<span>xiv</span> and a composite RAW shooting function that gives the ability to combine multiple consecutive images into a high-quality composite.</p>
<h3>Advanced Video Performance Without Distortion</h3>
<p>The global shutter image sensor provides distortion-free image expression for videos as well as still images. For example, the user can shoot images of nearby scenery from a fast-moving vehicle such as a car or fast-moving subjects with ease. This camera is the first in the Alpha™ series to be able to record 4K 120p high-frame-rate video without cropping, allowing the user to shoot at the angle of view intended. It is also possible to shoot high-resolution 4K 60p videos with 6K oversampling.</p>
<p>The Alpha 9 III has S-Cinetone™, a unique Sony feature which can create a cinematic look straight out of the camera without post-processing. S-Cinetone was created through the development of the VENICE high-end cinema camera and makes human skin tones and subjects stand out beautifully, creating natural highlights. The Alpha 9 III has the latest video performance including rich gradation performance and S-Log3, and when in Log shooting mode, it can reflect and display the user's favorite imported LUT (lookup table). The Alpha 9 III is compatible with the mobile app "Monitor &amp; Control" for video creators.</p>
<h3>Operability and Reliability for Professionals</h3>
<p>Sony has listened to the voices of professional photographers and created operability and reliability that supports professional users. The shape of the grip is improved and ergonomically designed so that it can be easily held in the palm of the hand to avoid straining the user even when wearing a telephoto lens or using it for long periods of time.</p>
<p>The VG-C5 vertical grip (sold separately), provides the same operability and versatility as when shooting horizontally; the user can comfortably support long shooting sessions. The grip and shutter button area share the same design as the main body, allowing image capture without feeling uncomfortable, with the same operability as the camera. The Alpha 9 III is equipped with a 4-axis multi-angle LCD monitor that can be operated by touch, allowing for intuitive operation using the latest touch menu. The electronic viewfinder uses a 9.44 million-dot Quad XGA OLED and achieves high visibility with the same brightness as the Alpha 7R V and a magnification of approximately 0.90x. Also, a custom button is placed on the front of the camera, and the continuous shooting speed can be changed by operating the custom button assigned with Continuous Shooting Speed Boost with the finger holding the grip, allowing for highly immediate operations. It supports professional photographers when shooting in all environments.</p>
<h3>High-Speed Workflow and Scalability to Support Immediate Delivery</h3>
<p>New features for the Alpha 9 III include a playback image filter that allows the user to efficiently select a large number of images using high-speed continuous shooting, and a function menu that can be used even during image playback, strongly supporting professional workflows from shooting to delivery.</p>
<p>The "Playback Function Menu" can be assigned in advance, so the user can perform protection, smartphone transfer, File transfer protocol, etc. during image playback. The user can select images narrowed down with a playback filter and play them from the function menu, allowing for quick delivery of specific images. The camera has a dedicated microphone for voice memos on the back, and by positioning the built-in microphone near the user’s mouth allows clear recording of audio even in noisy environments. The recorded audio data can be transferred via FTP along with the images. The camera allows the user to set up to 20 presets from the International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC), an international consultative body in which news organizations from various countries participate. ​</p>
<p>The Alpha 9 III can transfer data up to twice as fast as the Alpha 9 II. 5 GHz communication offers maximum speed and stability for news and sports shooters who need to deliver immediately via FTP, as well as for studio environments. The Alpha 9 III allows stills and movies to be recorded to memory media in numerous ways including the two media slots that support CFexpress Type A cards as well as UHS-I and UHS-II SD cards.</p>
<p>It is compatible with the professional mobile application "Transfer &amp; Tagging" which speeds up the image delivery workflow, and the application "Remote Camera Tool" which allows remote shooting of PCs using wired LAN. Also, Sony plans to support a new version of Camera Remote SDK, a software development kit that allows remote camera operation and changing shooting settings, in Spring 2024.</p>
<p>In addition, the Alpha 9 III is scheduled to support functional enhancements such as FTP operability, relay playback, and C2PA<span>xv</span> ​ format support <span>xvi</span> through a camera software update<span>xvii</span>.</p>
<h3>Firmware Updates for the Alpha 1 and Alpha 7S III Models</h3>
<p>In addition to the release of Alpha 9 III, Sony has announced new firmware updates for the Alpha 1 and Alpha 7S III full-frame mirrorless cameras<span> xvii</span>. The new software will provide both models with some of Sony’s latest imaging technologies including the highly requested Focus Breathing Compensation feature, IPTC and FTP workflow enhancement, and C2PA format support. The firmware will also update the Alpha 1 with Relay Playback, and the Alpha 7S III with DCI 4K 24.00P shooting format. The camera software update will be available in Spring 2024.</p>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>The Alpha 9 III camera is available for pre-order Nov. 8, 2023, at a variety of Sony's authorized dealers, for a suggested retail price of $5,999.99 USD and $8,299.99 CAN.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Designing a new domain specific language is as any other complex task sometimes error-prone and usually time consuming, especially if the language shall be of high-quality and comfortably usable. Existing tool support focuses on the simplification of technical aspects but lacks support for an enforcement of principles for a good language design. In this paper we investigate guidelines that are useful for designing domain specific languages, largely based on our experience in developing languages as well as relying on existing guidelines on general purpose (GPLs) and modeling languages. We defined guidelines to support a DSL developer to achieve better quality of the language design and a better acceptance among its users.

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-overview" dir="auto"><a href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">LLMs as a way to browse the web is being explored by numerous startups and open-source projects. With this project, I was interested in seeing if we could only use <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card" rel="nofollow">GPT-4V</a>'s vision capabilities for web browsing.</p>
<p dir="auto">The issue with this is it's hard to determine what the model wants to click on without giving it the browser DOM as text. <a href="https://vimium.github.io/" rel="nofollow">Vimium</a> is a Chrome extension that lets you navigate the web with only your keyboard. I thought it would be interesting to see if we could use Vimium to give the model a way to interact with the web.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-ideas" dir="auto"><a href="#ideas">Ideas</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Feel free to collaborate with me on this, I have a number of ideas:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Use <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview" rel="nofollow">Assistant API</a> once it's released for automatic context retrieval. The Assistant API will create a thread that we can add messages too, to keep the history of actions, but it doesn't support the Vision API yet.</li>
<li>Vimium fork for overlaying elements. A specialized version of Vimium that selectively overlays elements based on context could be useful, effectively pruning based on the user query. Might be worth testing if different sized boxes/colors help.</li>
<li>Use higher resolution images, as it seems to fail at low res. I noticed that below a certain threshold, the model wouldn't detect anything. This might be improved by using higher resolution images but that would require more tokens.</li>
<li>Fine-tune <a href="https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA">LLaVa</a> or <a href="https://github.com/THUDM/CogVLM">CogVLM</a> to do this. Could be faster/cheaper. CogVLM can accurately specify pixel coordinates which may be a good way to augment this.</li>
<li>Use JSON mode once it's released for Vision API. Currently the Vision API doesn't support JSON mode or function calling, so we have to rely on more primitive prompting methods.</li>
<li>Have the Vision API return general instructions, formalized by another call to the JSON mode version of the API. This is a workaround for the JSON mode issue but requires another LLM call, which is slower/more expensive.</li>
<li>Add speech-to-text with Whisper or another model to eliminate text input and make this more accessible.</li>
<li>Make this work for your own browser instead of spinning up an artificial one. I want to be able to order food with my credit card.</li>
<li>Provide the frames with and without Vimium enabled in case the model can't see what's under the yellow square.</li>
<li>Pass the Chrome accessibility tree in as input in addition to the image. This provides a layout of interactive elements that can be mapped to the Vimium bindings.</li>
</ul>

      Using a travel agent to buy a plane ticket&nbsp;or a stockbroker to trade equities seem like relics of the past. And yet, every day, people across America hire a real estate agent to help them sell a home. It’s one of the few industries that has been able to largely avoid the disruption that has helped consumers cut costs in the Internet age.

      And that is largely because of the power of the National Association of Realtors, the largest professional organization in America and a significant lobbying group for the real estate industry.

      But the verdict handed down in a Missouri court on Tuesday that found NAR and two brokerage firms, Homeservices of America and Keller Williams Realty, were liable for $1.8 billion in damages for conspiring to keep commissions artificially high,&nbsp;may mark the beginning of the end of how homes are bought and sold.

      “This matter is not close to being final as we will appeal the jury’s verdict,” said Mantill Williams, NAR vice president of communications. “In the interim, we will ask the court to reduce the damages awarded by the jury.”
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k01000l3b6ijgiboaeh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “This is not the end,” said Darryl Frost, spokesperson for Keller Williams.

      The cornerstone of the plaintiff’s argument is that NAR is forcing homesellers to pay an inflated commission that is then split between their agent and the buyer’s agent.&nbsp;The homesellers argued commission sharing as a condition for access to the Multiple Listing Service was unfair and kept commissions artificially high.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k01000o3b6i4glbjvwx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Typically, when a home goes on the market for sale, the seller offers their broker a set commission. For decades, the commission has&nbsp;consistently been around 6% of the sale price, usually with a 3% split for the buyer’s and seller’s agent.
  </p>

  


  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k01000q3b6i9zloguvw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      In a competitive market, the homesellers argue, the cost of the buyer’s agent’s commission would be paid not by the seller, but by the buyer who received the service. The sellers said that the buyers should be able to negotiate the fee with their agent, and that the sellers should not be on the hook for paying it.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k01000r3b6iliyvp2z9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      NAR and the other defendants argued in court that their commissions are always negotiable. They also said that the system of having the seller’s agent split the commission with the buyer’s agent allows buyers, who are already weighed down with expenses like a downpayment, closing costs, inspections and appraisals, to avoid the added expense of having to pay an agent as well.

      Consumer advocates celebrated the verdict and hoped that plaintiffs would also receive their request for the judge to order changes to how commissions are structured in the industry.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k01000t3b6itcnvq1dj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      While already large, the award could grow even more — to a total of $5 billion, depending on what the judge decides.

      The jury clearly saw the industry had restricted price competition to a point where it could ensure nearly uniform 5%-6% commissions, said Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America. Jurors made their decision quickly, he said, deliberating for only a few hours.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k01000v3b6iwgicpier@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “The extent of injunctive relief decided by the court will strongly influence whether a price competitive system develops that lowers consumer costs and increases quality of services,” Brobeck said. “We hope that the court will sever the ties between listing agent and buyer agent compensation, freeing sellers from the obligation and need to compensate buyer agents.”

      The longer-term impact of the verdict may be that the pairing of buyer’s agent commission and seller’s agent commission will eventually be separated.

      Analysts from Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, an investment banking firm, said in report released ahead of the verdict that the NAR litigation and related government action is likely to reshape the residential brokerage industry’s commission structure, by eliminating the buyer-broker commission rule, and eventually the practice of listing agents and sellers setting and paying buyer agent commissions.
  </p>

      And since the commission paid to an agent is typically baked into a home price, if they were reduced&nbsp;or were to become more negotiable, home prices could drop as well, they said.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k0100113b6iksjfc8kw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “Short term nothing changes,” said Jen Davis, a Keller Williams agent with Holt Homes Group, in Springfield, Missouri. “Commissions have always been negotiable. That will continue to be the case.”

      But there could be unintended consequences if changes come about, she said.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k0100133b6i05cpnigs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “There are buyers that aren’t going to know the steps to buy a home,” Davis said. “They have to pay for a down payment, closing costs, appraisals, inspections. If they also have to come up with money to pay for a buyer’s agent, some just won’t and they’ll get in over their heads or they won’t buy at all. Not having representation will make the market less inclusive.”

      Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has personally and repeatedly thwarted initiatives meant to improve the well-being of teens on Facebook and Instagram, at times directly overruling some of his most senior lieutenants, according to internal communications made public as part of an ongoing lawsuit against the company.
  </p>

      The disclosures highlight Zuckerberg’s sway over decisions at Meta that can affect billions of users. And they also shed light on tensions that have occasionally arisen between Zuckerberg and other Meta officials who have pushed to enhance user well-being.

      Zuckerberg vetoed a 2019 proposal that would have disabled Instagram’s so-called “beauty filters,” a technology that digitally alters a user’s on-screen appearance and allegedly harms teens’ mental health by promoting unrealistic body image expectations, according to the unredacted version of the complaint filed this week by Massachusetts officials.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloq042ku00043b6h072835z9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      After sitting on the proposal for months, Zuckerberg wrote to his deputies in April 2020 asserting that there was “demand” for the filters and that he had seen “no data” suggesting the filters were harmful, according to the complaint.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloq042ku00053b6hpjjrc618@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Despite Zuckerberg’s conclusion, the proposal had enjoyed broad support, the lawsuit said, including from Mosseri; Instagram’s policy chief, Karina Newton; the head of Facebook, Fidji Simo, and Meta’s vice president of product design, Margaret Gould Stewart. (Simo and Mosseri had lamented at other times, according to the lawsuit, that a lack of investment in well-being initiatives meant Meta lacked “a roadmap of work that demonstrates we care about well-being.”)
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloq042ku00063b6hqaby4ohv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Stewart had first pitched the idea to disable beauty filters, citing recommendations by academics and Meta’s outside advisors, while Newton wrote an email adding it had strong backing from departments including “comms, marketing [and] policy,” the lawsuit said.
  </p>

      But after Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth brought the matter to Zuckerberg’s attention, Zuckerberg ultimately rejected the plan and the filters were allowed to remain, according to the complaint.

      Stewart later wrote to Zuckerberg, fretting that his decision not to disable the filters could come back to haunt the company.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloqbio9v00033b6hataeed6a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “I respect your call on this and I’ll support it,” Stewart wrote, according to a message cited in the complaint, “but want to just say for the record that I don’t think it’s the right call given the risks…. I just hope that years from now we will look back and feel good about the decision we made here.”
  </p>

      In response to the newly unsealed communications, Meta spokesman Andy Stone said such image filters are commonly used in the industry.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloq521ck00013b6hetffleuc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “While filters exist across every major social platform and smartphone camera, Meta bans those that directly promote cosmetic surgery, changes in skin color or extreme weight loss,” Stone said. “We clearly note when a filter is being used and we work to proactively review effects against these rules before they go live.”

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloq522un00033b6hpy57iihx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Stone added that Meta offers 30 tools to support teens and families, including the ability to set screen-time limits and the option to remove like counts from posts. (In the unredacted portions of the complaint, the Massachusetts suit alleges that the experiment to remove like counts from posts, codenamed Project Daisy, had originally been proposed as an app-wide default but was later downgraded to an opt-in feature that is rarely used.)

      A year after the beauty filter decision, in August 2021, Clegg pressed Zuckerberg to make “additional investment to strengthen our position on wellbeing across the company,” citing a staff recommendation to address issues of addiction, self-harm and bullying, according to the complaint. By this time, the company was just weeks away from being hit with Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen’s bombshell <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=hp_lead_pos7" target="_blank">allegations</a> that Instagram knew its services could be harmful to teens.

      Haugen’s anonymous allegations in September jumpstarted intense scrutiny of Instagram. As Haugen <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/04/tech/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-what-we-know/index.html">revealed her identity</a> in October, Mosseri wrote to another Meta product executive that same month in reference to Clegg’s proposal, the lawsuit said, saying he was “really worried” about well-being “but have made little progress.”

      Zuckerberg allegedly remained silent on Clegg’s proposal throughout this time, prompting Clegg to reiterate his concerns to Zuckerberg in November. Finally, Zuckerberg appeared to respond through Meta’s chief financial officer, Susan Li, who “tersely respond[ed] that staffing was too ‘constrained’ to meet the request,” the lawsuit said.

      Li responded similarly on Zuckerberg’s behalf after another product executive, David Ginsberg, emailed Zuckerberg in 2019 highlighting internal and external research suggesting that the company’s services were having a negative impact on people’s well-being. Ginsberg proposed hiring more engineers to build well-being tools to respond to addiction, social comparison and loneliness, but Li “responded that Meta’s leadership team declined to fund this initiative,” according to the complaint.

      Zuckerberg’s rejection of opportunities to invest more heavily in well-being are reflective of his data-centric approach to management, said Arturo Bejar, the former Facebook engineering director and whistleblower who leveled his own allegations last week that Instagram has repeatedly ignored internal warnings about the app’s potential harms to teens.

      “My understanding was that Mark needed causal data,” Bejar said, “for you to be able to demonstrate that because somebody was using a filter, that that would have an impact on how they perceive themselves.”

      “All the people that I’ve talked to internally about this were like… Mark’s level of proof, in order to be able to take the work seriously and act on it, is too high,” Bejar added. “I think it’s an impossible standard to meet.”

      A 2020 internal presentation discussed in the complaint described how Instagram meets teenagers’ desire for “novelty seeking” with “a dopamine hit” through intermittent notifications about comments, follows and other bids for attention that can convey a sense of “approval and acceptance [that] are huge rewards for teens.”

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><img src="https://www.omegle.com/static/gravestone.png" alt="" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.” — C.S. Lewis</p>
<p>“In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.” — Douglas Adams</p>
<p>Dear strangers,</p>
<p>From the moment I discovered the Internet at a young age, it has been a magical place to me. Growing up in a small town, relatively isolated from the larger world, it was a revelation how much more there was to discover – how many interesting people and ideas the world had to offer.</p>
<p>As a young teenager, I couldn’t just waltz onto a college campus and tell a student: “Let’s debate moral philosophy!” I couldn’t walk up to a professor and say: “Tell me something interesting about microeconomics!” But online, I was able to meet those people, and have those conversations. I was also an avid Wikipedia editor; I contributed to open source software projects; and I often helped answer computer programming questions posed by people many years older than me.</p>
<p>In short, the Internet opened the door to a much larger, more diverse, and more vibrant world than I would have otherwise been able to experience; and enabled me to be an active participant in, and contributor to, that world. All of this helped me to learn, and to grow into a more well-rounded person.</p>
<p>Moreover, as a survivor of childhood rape, I was acutely aware that any time I interacted with someone in the physical world, I was risking my physical body. The Internet gave me a refuge from that fear. I was under no illusion that only good people used the Internet; but I knew that, if I said “no” to someone online, they couldn’t physically reach through the screen and hold a weapon to my head, or worse. I saw the miles of copper wires and fiber-optic cables between me and other people as a kind of shield – one that empowered me to be less isolated than my trauma and fear would have otherwise allowed.</p>
<p>I launched Omegle when I was 18 years old, and still living with my parents. It was meant to build on the things I loved about the Internet, while introducing a form of social spontaneity that I felt didn’t exist elsewhere. If the Internet is a manifestation of the “global village”, Omegle was meant to be a way of strolling down a street in that village, striking up conversations with the people you ran into along the way.</p>
<p>The premise was rather straightforward: when you used Omegle, it would randomly place you in a chat with someone else. These chats could be as long or as short as you chose. If you didn’t want to talk to a particular person, for whatever reason, you could simply end the chat and – if desired – move onto another chat with someone else. It was the idea of “meeting new people” distilled down to almost its platonic ideal.</p>
<p>Building on what I saw as the intrinsic safety benefits of the Internet, users were anonymous to each other by default. This made chats more self-contained, and made it less likely that a malicious person would be able to track someone else down off-site after their chat ended.</p>
<p>I didn’t really know what to expect when I launched Omegle. Would anyone even care about some Web site that an 18 year old kid made in his bedroom in his parents’ house in Vermont, with no marketing budget? But it became popular almost instantly after launch, and grew organically from there, reaching millions of daily users. I believe this had something to do with meeting new people being a basic human need, and with Omegle being among the best ways to fulfill that need. As the saying goes: “If you build a better mousetrap, the world will beat a path to your door.”</p>
<p>Over the years, people have used Omegle to explore foreign cultures; to get advice about their lives from impartial third parties; and to help alleviate feelings of loneliness and isolation. I’ve even heard stories of soulmates meeting on Omegle, and getting married. Those are only some of the highlights.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are also lowlights. Virtually every tool can be used for good or for evil, and that is especially true of communication tools, due to their innate flexibility. The telephone can be used to wish your grandmother “happy birthday”, but it can also be used to call in a bomb threat. There can be no honest accounting of Omegle without acknowledging that some people misused it, including to commit unspeakably heinous crimes.</p>
<p>I believe in a responsibility to be a “good Samaritan”, and to implement reasonable measures to fight crime and other misuse. That is exactly what Omegle did. In addition to the basic safety feature of anonymity, there was a great deal of moderation behind the scenes, including state-of-the-art AI operating in concert with a wonderful team of human moderators. Omegle punched above its weight in content moderation, and I’m proud of what we accomplished.</p>
<p>Omegle’s moderation even had a positive impact beyond the site. Omegle worked with law enforcement agencies, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, to help put evildoers in prison where they belong. There are “people” rotting behind bars right now thanks in part to evidence that Omegle proactively collected against them, and tipped the authorities off to.</p>
<p>All that said, the fight against crime isn’t one that can ever truly be won. It’s a never-ending battle that must be fought and re-fought every day; and even if you do the very best job it is possible for you to do, you may make a sizable dent, but you won’t “win” in any absolute sense of that word. That’s heartbreaking, but it’s also a basic lesson of criminology, and one that I think the vast majority of people understand on some level. Even superheroes, the fictional characters that our culture imbues with special powers as a form of wish fulfillment in the fight against crime, don’t succeed at eliminating crime altogether.</p>
<p>In recent years, it seems like the whole world has become more ornery. Maybe that has something to do with the pandemic, or with political disagreements. Whatever the reason, people have become faster to attack, and slower to recognize each other’s shared humanity. One aspect of this has been a constant barrage of attacks on communication services, Omegle included, based on the behavior of a malicious subset of users.</p>
<p>To an extent, it is reasonable to question the policies and practices of any place where crime has occurred. I have always welcomed constructive feedback; and indeed, Omegle implemented a number of improvements based on such feedback over the years. However, the recent attacks have felt anything but constructive. The only way to please these people is to stop offering the service. Sometimes they say so, explicitly and avowedly; other times, it can be inferred from their act of setting standards that are not humanly achievable. Either way, the net result is the same.</p>
<p>Omegle is the direct target of these attacks, but their ultimate victim is <em>you</em>: all of you out there who have used, or would have used, Omegle to improve your lives, and the lives of others. When they say Omegle shouldn’t exist, they are really saying that you shouldn’t be allowed to use it; that you shouldn’t be allowed to meet random new people online. That idea is anathema to the ideals I cherish – specifically, to the bedrock principle of a free society that, when restrictions are imposed to prevent crime, the burden of those restrictions must not be targeted at innocent victims or potential victims of crime.</p>
<p>Consider the idea that society ought to force women to dress modestly in order to prevent rape. One counter-argument is that rapists don’t really target women based on their clothing; but a more powerful counter-argument is that, irrespective of what rapists do, women’s rights should remain intact. If society robs women of their rights to bodily autonomy and self-expression based on the actions of rapists – even if it does so with the best intentions in the world – then society is practically doing the work of rapists for them.</p>
<p>Fear can be a valuable tool, guiding us away from danger. However, fear can also be a mental cage that keeps us from all of the things that make life worth living. Individuals and families must be allowed to strike the right balance for themselves, based on their own unique circumstances and needs. A world of mandatory fear is a world ruled by fear – a dark place indeed.</p>
<p>I’ve done my best to weather the attacks, with the interests of Omegle’s users – and the broader principle – in mind. If something as simple as meeting random new people is forbidden, what’s next? That is far and away removed from anything that could be considered a reasonable compromise of the principle I outlined. Analogies are a limited tool, but a physical-world analogy might be shutting down Central Park because crime occurs there – or perhaps more provocatively, destroying the universe because it contains evil. A healthy, free society cannot endure when we are collectively afraid of each other to this extent.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what is right doesn’t always prevail. As much as I wish circumstances were different, the stress and expense of this fight – coupled with the existing stress and expense of operating Omegle, and fighting its misuse – are simply too much. Operating Omegle is no longer sustainable, financially nor psychologically. Frankly, I don’t want to have a heart attack in my 30s.</p>
<p>The battle for Omegle has been lost, but the war against the Internet rages on. Virtually every online communication service has been subject to the same kinds of attack as Omegle; and while some of them are much larger companies with much greater resources, they all have their breaking point somewhere. I worry that, unless the tide turns soon, the Internet I fell in love with may cease to exist, and in its place, we will have something closer to a souped-up version of TV – focused largely on passive consumption, with much less opportunity for active participation and genuine human connection. If that sounds like a bad idea to you, please consider donating to the <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate/join-eff">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, an organization that fights for your rights online.</p>
<p>From the bottom of my heart, thank you to everyone who used Omegle for positive purposes, and to everyone who contributed to the site’s success in any way. I’m so sorry I couldn’t keep fighting for you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>

  </header>

  <p>The new Swift 5.9 release contains a number of helpful, new features for debugging code, including an out-of-process, interactive
crash handler to inspect crashes in real time, the ability to trigger
the debugger for just-in-time debugging, along with concurrency-aware
backtracing to make it easier to understand control flow in a program
that uses structured concurrency.</p>

<h3 id="out-of-process-crash-handling">Out-of-Process Crash Handling</h3>

<p>Prior to Swift 5.9, all you would get when your program fails is a message
from the parent process (often the shell) telling you that the child
process crashed:</p>

<div>
<pre><span>$ </span><span>./crash</span>
I'm going to crash now
zsh: segmentation fault  ./crash
</pre>
</div>

<p>On Apple platforms or on Windows, you could look at the crash logs
captured by the operating system’s built-in crash reporter, but on
Linux that’s typically all you had to go on.</p>

<p>Now, instead of the opaque message above, the result looks something like this:</p>

<div>
<pre><span>$ </span><span>./crash</span>

<p>This new feature greatly improves the on-crash debugging experience on Linux, where it is on by default. It is useful on macOS as well, but must be manually
enabled. It is not presently supported on Windows.</p>

<h3 id="interactive-backtraces">Interactive Backtraces</h3>

<p>You might be wondering about the message on the last line of the
in-terminal backtrace above, where it says:</p>

<div><pre><code>Press space to interact, D to debug, or any other key to quit (30s)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Often when developing a program at the terminal, you might find that
the program crashes, but you aren’t able to reproduce the problem.
Without a suitable crash log, that can be very frustrating — you know
your program has a bug, but you don’t know what it was or how to
reproduce it.</p>

<p>The idea behind this feature is that it leaves the program suspended
(by default for 30 seconds, but this is configurable) and provides you
with the opportunity to either attach a debugger, or perform some
additional inspection of the crashed process.</p>

<p>If you tap the spacebar when this prompt appears, you will be
presented with a simple command prompt that allows you to change the
backtracer settings, generate a new backtrace, list loaded images,
display register and memory contents, and get a listing of all of the
threads in the process.  Typing <code>help</code> at the prompt will bring up a
list of available commands:</p>

<div>
<pre><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>help
Available commands:

backtrace  Display a backtrace.
bt         Synonym for backtrace.
debug      Attach the debugger.
exit       Exit interaction, allowing program to crash normally.
help       Display help.
images     List images loaded by the program.
mem        Synonym for memory.
memory     Inspect memory.
process    Show information about the process.
quit       Synonym for exit.
reg        Synonym for registers.
registers  Display the registers.
set        Set or show options.
thread     Show or set the current thread.
threads    Synonym for process.
</pre>
</div>

<p>If you use the <code>debug</code> command or press <code>D</code> at the prompt, the
backtracer will help you to attach a debugger to your program.
Exactly what happens here is platform-dependent.</p>

<p>If you press any other key, or if the 30 second timer runs down, the
program will be allowed to crash normally.</p>

<p>By default, the interactive feature will trigger if your program’s
standard input and output are both attached to a terminal. In many
cases, this means you’ll get the right behavior automatically if
you’re running in a CI system or as part of an automated script,
as those tend to run with the program’s output redirected to a
pipe or a file.</p>

<p>In situations where you do not want this feature enabled, you can
explicitly disable it by setting the environment variable
<code>SWIFT_BACKTRACE</code> to <code>interactive=no</code>. You can also disable the color
output with <code>color=no</code>, as well as combine multiple options like <code>interactive=no,color=no</code>.</p>

<h3 id="structured-concurrency-support">Structured Concurrency Support</h3>

<p>The backtracer is concurrency-aware and will correctly step back
through asynchronous frames.  For example, given the program:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>level</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>async</span> <span>{</span>

<p>On Apple platforms, this feature has no special requirements, but for
other platforms the backtracer needs to be able to look up symbols
to determine whether or not a given frame is asynchronous.  If the
necessary symbols are not available, the backtrace will follow the
normal program stack rather than the async activation chain.  This
will usually result in it showing frames from the concurrency runtime,
which are unlikely to be helpful when debugging most types of problem.</p>

<h3 id="improving-readability">Improving Readability</h3>

<p>The new backtracer also has a number of options to improve readability.</p>

<p>You can configure the maximum number of frames that the backtracer
will generate (the default is 64), but since you might also want to
see frames at the top of the stack, the backtracer also has a setting
for the number of frames to capture there (by default 16).  This is
particularly handy if your program crashes due to excessive recursion,
as you’ll usually see both the recursion and the cause of it, without
being overwhelmed by thousands and thousands of frames.</p>

<p>The backtracer also skips over system frames and Swift thunks by
default.  These are usually not relevant except to compiler or runtime
engineers, and generally result in more confusing output for most
developers.</p>

<p>Additionally, the backtracer will automatically demangle both Swift
and C++ mangled names.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>The new on-crash debugging options in Swift 5.9 help you
debug your programs when they misbehave. The backtracer has a
number of helpful features including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Out-of-process crash handling</li>
  <li>Smart, in-line display of program source, where available</li>
  <li>The option to pause and inspect your crashed program, or even
trigger the debugger for just-in-time debugging</li>
  <li>Support for Swift Concurrency</li>
  <li>Support for C++ name mangling in addition to Swift</li>
  <li>Colorized output for readability</li>
  <li>Expanded configuration options (<a href="https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/Backtracing.rst">see
documentation</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>The new feature is enabled by default on Linux and can be enabled for macOS (<a href="https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/Backtracing.rst">see
documentation</a>).
There is no Windows support at present.</p>

<p>Comedic performers frequently show humorous tendencies early in life, often identified as the 'class clown' throughout school.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFisher19812_12-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFisher19812-12">[12]</a></sup> Comics recalled mocking the strict nature of school, taking great pleasure in the laughter from their peers.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_4-1"><a href="#cite_note-:3-4">[4]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Smothers" title="Tom Smothers">Tommy Smothers</a> commented that during his schooling experiences;"I got a big kick out of them laughing, but I didn’t know what it was that made them laugh, but I knew I could make people laugh."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFisher19813_13-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFisher19813-13">[13]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Carson" title="Johnny Carson">Johnny Carson</a> also emphasised the role of school in a comedian’s life stating that:<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFisher19813_13-1"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFisher19813-13">[13]</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote><p>I think, by the fact that you find you can get laughs when you are in school—and this is where most of the guys start, when they are growing up in the neighbourhood—they're jerking around, doing silly things, interrupting the class. It's an attention-getting thing, and that, in effect, is saying, 'Hey, look at me, folks, I'm getting your acceptance.'</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite comedians often being of high intelligence, the school environment was detested and frequently avoided.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup> Comics explained that their teachers lacked understanding and acceptance, identifying their mannerisms as a form of personal exclusion.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a> commented that school "was boring, frightening.

I never did the homework."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFisher19813_13-2"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFisher19813-13">[13]</a></sup> Even though a school’s orientation to order and discipline conflicts with the nature of a comic, it can serve as an initial arena for an individual to realise their ability to produce laughter.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFisher19814_14-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFisher19814-14">[14]</a></sup> This discovery creates mixed feelings as frequently the laughter can be directed at themselves with undertones of ridicule or mockery.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFisher19815_15-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFisher19815-15">[15]</a></sup> Regardless of the unpleasantness involved, comics are attracted to the ability of 'making' someone laugh and the power it holds.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_4-2"><a href="#cite_note-:3-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>The talent for creating humour directs the individual towards a career in the entertainment industry.

</p><p>A study conducted by Fisher found humour-orientated individuals likely to identify their mothers as demanding, unsympathetic and distant.

<p>The early lives of comedians are characterised by suffering, isolation and feelings of deprivation, where humour is used as an outlet or defence against experienced anxiety.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEJanus1975174_11-2"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJanus1975174-11">[11]</a></sup>  German philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a> once described it as; "man alone suffers so excruciatingly in the world that he was compelled to invent laughter."<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>  The inability to exhibit direct aggression results in expression through the socially acceptable manner of humour.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_27-0"><a href="#cite_note-:1-27">[27]</a></sup>
</p><p>Humour provides the ability to assert control and invincibility in a situation.<sup id="cite_ref-:5_9-1"><a href="#cite_note-:5-9">[9]</a></sup> An example is the British comedian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Milligan" title="Spike Milligan">Spike Milligan</a>, who suffered from a long cycle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder" title="Bipolar disorder">manic-depressive</a> states that were onset by severe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder" title="Mental disorder">mental breakdowns</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-clare_28-0"><a href="#cite_note-clare-28">[28]</a></sup> Milligan was capable of creating light-hearted humour and outrageous ideas, despite his manic state.

<p>The use of inkblot imaging reveals certain characteristics and worries of comedic performers that are not matched in regular actors.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFisher198120_32-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFisher198120-32">[32]</a></sup> Fisher identified four key trends that were common for comedians' Rorschach Tests;
</p>
<ul><li>The identification of '<b>not-bad'</b> imagery. This involves a traditional, negative idea that has been misunderstood and is a victim to preconceived views.

<p>A joke dating from at least the 19th century exemplifies the sad clown paradox. The joke involves a doctor recommending his depressed patient to visit a great clown in town (typically named "Pagliacci"), but it turns out that the patient is actually the clown out of costume.

</p><p>The poem was then seen as a story in the 1910s, again, with the performer called 'Grimaldi',<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> and again from the 1930s,<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> featuring a clown called 'Grock', suggested as being the Swiss clown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Adrien_Wettach" title="Charles Adrien Wettach">Charles Adrien Wettach</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-punica-serving-multiple-lora-finetuned-llm-as-one" dir="auto"><a href="#punica-serving-multiple-lora-finetuned-llm-as-one">Punica: Serving multiple LoRA finetuned LLM as one</a></h2>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18547" rel="nofollow">(paper)</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-overview" dir="auto"><a href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685" rel="nofollow">Low rank adapation</a> (LoRA) is a parameter efficient way to add new knowledge to a pretrained LLM. Although the pretrained LLM takes 100s of GB storage, a LoRA finetuned model only adds 1% storage and memory overhead. Punica enables running multiple LoRA finetuned models at the cost of running one.</p>
<p dir="auto">How?</p>
<p dir="auto">Assuming <code>W</code> of shape <code>[H1, H2]</code> is the weight of the pretrained model, LoRA adds two small matrices <code>A</code> of shape <code>[H1, r]</code> and <code>B</code> of <code>[r, H2]</code>. Running a input <code>x</code> on the finetuned model would be <code>y := x @ (W + A@B)</code>, which is the same as <code>y := x@W + x@A@B</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">When there are <code>n</code> LoRA models, there will be <code>A1</code>, <code>B1</code>, <code>A2</code>, <code>B2</code>, ..., <code>An</code>, <code>Bn</code>.  Given a input batch <code>X := (x1,x2,...,xn)</code> that maps to each LoRA model, the output is <code>Y := X@W + (x1@A1@B1, x2@A2@B2, ..., xn@An@Bn)</code>. The left-hand-side computes the input batch on the pretrained model. It is quite efficient. The latency is almost the same as when there's only one input, thanks to the strong <a href="https://le.qun.ch/en/blog/2023/05/13/transformer-batching/" rel="nofollow">batching effect</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">We figured out an efficient way to compute the right-hand-side (the LoRA addon). We encapsulate this operation in a CUDA kernel, called Segmented Gather Matrix-Vector multiplication (SGMV), as illustrated below.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/punica-ai/punica/blob/master/assets/sgmv.png"><img src="https://github.com/punica-ai/punica/raw/master/assets/sgmv.png" alt="SGMV"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In the following microbenchmark figure, we can observe the strong batching effect of the pretrained model. Naive implementation of LoRA is slow, as depicted in the orange line. LoRA implemented via SGMV is effificent and preserves the strong batching effect.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/punica-ai/punica/blob/master/assets/backbone-vs-sgmv.png"><img src="https://github.com/punica-ai/punica/raw/master/assets/backbone-vs-sgmv.png" alt="SGMV is fast and maintains strong batching effect"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The following figure shows the text generation throughput comparison between Punica and other systems, including <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/">HuggingFace Transformers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed">DeepSpeed</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer">FasterTransformer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm">vLLM</a>. The benchmark considers different settings of LoRA model popularity. <em>Distinct</em> means that each request is for a different LoRA model. <em>Identical</em> means that all requests are for the same LoRA model. <em>Uniform</em> and <em>Skewed</em> are in between. <strong>Punica achieves 12x throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems.</strong></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://eslint.org/blog/2022/07/interesting-bugs-caught-by-no-constant-binary-expression/">https://eslint.org/blog/2022/07/interesting-bugs-caught-by-no-constant-binary-expression/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38196644">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>In <a href="https://eslint.org/blog/2022/04/eslint-v8.14.0-released">ESLint v8.14.0</a> I contributed a new core rule called <a href="https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-constant-binary-expression">no-constant-binary-expression</a> which has surprised me with the wide variety of subtle and interesting bugs it has been able to detect.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll explain what the rule does and share some examples of real bugs it has detected in popular open source projects such as Material UI, Webpack, VS Code, and Firefox as well as a few interesting bugs that it found internally at Meta. I hope these examples will convince you to try enabling the rule in the projects you work on!</p>
<h2 id="what-does-no-constant-binary-expression-do%3F" tabindex="-1">What does <code>no-constant-binary-expression</code> do?</h2>
<p>The rule checks for comparisons (<code>==</code>, <code>!==</code>, etc) where the outcome cannot vary at runtime, and logical expressions (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>??</code>, <code>||</code>) which will either <em>always</em> or <em>never</em> short-circuit.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>+x == null</code> will always be false, because <code>+</code> will coerce <code>x</code> into a number, and a number is never nullish.</li>
<li><code>{ ...foo } || DEFAULT</code> will never return <code>DEFAULT</code> because objects are always truthy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these are examples of expressions that <em>look</em> like they can affect the way the program evaluates, but in reality, do not.</p>
<p>This rule originally started as just an attempt to detect unnecessary null checks. However, as I worked on it, I realized useless null checks were just a special case of a broader category: useless code. Eventually it clicked for me: developers don’t intend to write useless code, and code that does not match the developer’s intent is by definition a bug. Therefore, any useless code you can detect is a bug.</p>
<p>This realization was confirmed for me when I ran the first version of the rule against our code base at Meta, and it detected a wide variety of subtle and interesting bugs which had made it through code review.</p>
<h2 id="real-world-bugs-found-with-no-constant-binary-expressions" tabindex="-1">Real world bugs found with <code>no-constant-binary-expressions</code></h2>
<p>In this section I’ll share a number of types of bugs that this rule can catch. Each includes at least one concrete example detected in a popular open source project. My choice to include real examples here is not to shame anyone or any project, but to drive home the fact that these are errors that any team can easily make.</p>
<h3 id="confusing-operator-precedence" tabindex="-1">Confusing operator precedence</h3>
<p>The most common class of bug the rule finds is places where developers misunderstood the precedence of operators, particularly unary operators like <code>!</code>, <code>+</code> and <code>typeof</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>whitelist<span>.</span><span>has</span><span>(</span>specifier<span>.</span>imported<span>.</span>name<span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>return</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>

<h3 id="confusing-%3F%3F-and-%7C%7C-precedence" tabindex="-1">Confusing <code>??</code> and <code>||</code> precedence</h3>
<p>When trying to define default values, people get confused with expressions like <code>a === b ?? c</code> and assume it will be parsed as <code>a === (b ?? c)</code>. When in actuality it will be parsed as <code>(a === b) ?? c</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>shouldShowWelcome</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>viewModel<span>?.</span>welcomeExperience <span>===</span> WelcomeExperience<span>.</span>ForWorkspace <span>??</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p><em>From <a href="https://github.com/captbaritone/vscode/blob/ab86e0229d6b4d0cb49cfd6747c92cafcd2bd4af/src/vs/workbench/contrib/testing/browser/testingExplorerView.ts#L118:L118">VS Code</a></em></p>
<p><em>Aside: Observing how frequently developers get confused by operator precedence inspired me to experiment with <a href="https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/a-vs-code-extension-to-combat-js-precedence-confusion/">a VS Code extension</a> to visually clarify how precedence gets interpreted.</em></p>
<h3 id="expecting-objects-to-be-compared-by-value" tabindex="-1">Expecting objects to be compared by value</h3>
<p>Developers coming from other languages where structures are compared by value, rather than by reference, can easily fall into the trap of thinking they can do things like test if an object is empty by comparing with a newly created empty object. Or course in JavaScript, objects are compared by reference, and no value can ever be equal to a newly constructed object literal.</p>
<p>In this example, <code>hasData</code> will always be set to true because <code>data</code> can never be referentially equal to a newly created object.</p>
<pre><code><span>hasData <span>=</span> hasData <span>||</span> data <span>!==</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre>
<p><em>From <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/0fe5678fb8b71f4eb26f0a153c52d0be45fc5ac1#l3.34">Firefox</a> (also: <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/0fe5678fb8b71f4eb26f0a153c52d0be45fc5ac1#l1.13">Firefox</a>)</em></p>
<h3 id="expecting-empty-objects-to-be-false-or-null" tabindex="-1">Expecting empty objects to be <code>false</code> or <code>null</code></h3>
<p>Another common categrory of JavaScript error is expecting empty objects to be nullish or falsy. This is likely an easy mistake to make for folks coming from a language like Python where empty lists and dictionaries are falsy.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>const</span> newConfigValue <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span>configProfiles <span>}</span> <span>??</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre>

<h3 id="is-it-%3E%3D-or-%3D%3E%3F" tabindex="-1">Is it <code>&gt;=</code> or <code>=&gt;</code>?</h3>
<p>I’ve only seen this particular typo once, but I wanted to include it because it’s a great example of the unexpected types of bugs this rule can catch.</p>
<p>Here, the developer meant to test if a value was greater than or equal to zero (<code>&gt;= 0</code>), but accidentally reversed the order of the characters and created an arrow function that returned <code>0 &amp;&amp; startWidth &lt;= 1</code>!</p>
<pre><code><span><span>assert</span><span>(</span><span>startWidth</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> startWidth <span>&lt;=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre>
<p><em>From <a href="https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/rMOZILLACENTRAL925b8d1ad45f80faee052492b3b43f5120052405">Mozilla</a></em></p>
<h3 id="other-errors-caught-by-no-constant-binary-expression" tabindex="-1">Other errors caught by <code>no-constant-binary-expression</code></h3>
<p>The above five categories of errors are not exhaustive. When I originally ran the first version of this rule on our (very) large monorepo at Meta, it found over 500 issues. While many fell into the categories outlined above, there was also a long-tail of other interesting bugs. Some highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking <code>||</code> allows for set operations: <code>states.includes('VALID' || 'IN_PROGRESS')</code></li>
<li>Thinking primitive functions pass through nulls: <code>Number(x) == null</code></li>
<li>Not knowing primitive <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/Number">constructors</a> return boxed primitives: <code>new Number(x) === 10</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I never would have set out to lint for these specific issues individually, but by simply trying to identify anything “useless” we were able to find and correct them.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you’ve now seen <code>no-constant-binary-expression</code> is capable of detecting a variety of different types of bugs. The rule accomplishes this not because it’s programmed to look for those specific issues, but because all those bugs have one thing in common: they manifest as useless code.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://labs.quansight.org/blog/building-scipy-with-flang">https://labs.quansight.org/blog/building-scipy-with-flang</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38196412">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You've probably heard already that Python 3.12 was released recently.
For a while already, we've been getting new feature releases every year,
so perhaps this wasn't big news to you – though there's lots of interesting
stuff in there!</p>
<p>It would appear even more "ordinary" that key packages (think <code>pandas</code>,
<code>matplotlib</code> etc.) in the ecosystem would have a release compatible with the
new Python version shortly after<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>, and broadly speaking, you would be right.
Not that there isn't a huge amount of dedicated maintainers (mostly
volunteers!) working tirelessly behind the scenes to make that happen,
but overall, it's a pretty routine situation.</p>
<p>However, behind the ordinary-seeming "SciPy released builds compatible with
Python 3.12" hides an extraordinary story worth telling, because of how several
unrelated, multi-decade-long timelines happened to clash in a way that could
have very easily led to no Python 3.12-compatible releases for a long time.</p>
<p>To understand why this was such a lucky coincidence (though we tried our best
to tip the scales, <em>a lot</em> of luck was necessary), we need to zoom out a bit
and explore the big players involved in this situation.
Fair warning: In the interest of brevity, the following recap is going to be
incomplete and opinionated.
From our perch on the shoulders of giants, let's take a quick look at the
landscape.</p>
<p>We'll briefly shed some light on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is Fortran still used in so many places?</li>
<li>How is that relevant to Python?</li>
<li>Past struggles of NumPy/SciPy with vanilla Python packaging.</li>
<li>What role conda-forge plays in this context.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you feel you have a good-enough understanding of all this, or not much time,
<a href="#the-situation">skip</a> right past the background. 😉</p>
<h2 id="fortran">Fortran</h2>
<p>… is almost unfathomably old in our day and age.
Started in 1953, first appearing in 1958, it quickly became the most important
programming language of its time, in an age when computing made several
important evolutionary leaps. Most importantly for our story:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of scientific code was written in Fortran (meaning often: the
accumulated math knowledge of many decades got crystallised into code), and:</li>
<li>There was a huge number of Fortran compilers, and in the age before Open
Source Software, all of those were proprietary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="compilers">Compilers</h2>
<p>Depending on how far behind the curtains you've dared to venture, you've
probably at least heard of the concept of a compiler.
Basically, computers have an exceptionally limited amount of operations at
their disposal, and it's agonisingly painful to write anything in those
primitives directly.
The job of the compiler is to translate whatever the programmer is writing in a
given compiled language, and turn it into something the computer can execute.</p>
<p>In many ways they're the closest to the hardware, which is why they often were
hyper-specific to one CPU architecture, or one operating system – not least
because you cannot write an operating system without a compiler, so the two
were often tightly coupled.
For example, Microsoft, from very early on, used its own compiler to create
Windows and all the bits on top of it.</p>
<p>This coupling further compounded the tendencies towards closed source
compilers, because the compiler source code might not only reveal secrets of
the compiler itself, but also of the architecture or the operating system
built with it.
And since vendors were keen to capitalise on every advantage in an intensely
competitive market, there was no incentive to share sources at all.</p>
<p>The pioneer to break that mould was the GNU compiler collection (GCC), which
became one of the key pillars of the nascent Free &amp; Open-Source Software (FOSS)
movement in the 80s and 90s.
The coupling to the operating system still stayed – in this case various
flavours of Unix, most prominently Linux of course – but GCC became a truly
universal compiler when it came to CPU architectures.</p>
<p>Let's visualise this quickly – we have a matrix of Operating Systems (OS) vs.
CPU Architectures; often compilers were specific not just to one OS, but also
1-2 specific architectures (for a long time the most dominant architecture has
been x86, but that has been changing in recent times).
What GCC did was essentially cover an entire column of that matrix, rather than
just 1-2 cells.</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>👉 OS<br>👇CPU Arch.</th>
<th>Linux</th>
<th>Windows</th>
<th>macOS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>x86_32</td>
<td rowspan="6">GCC</td>
<td rowspan="2">MSVC</td>
<td rowspan="3">Apple Clang</td></tr><tr><td>x86_64</td></tr><tr><td>arm64</td>
<td>(added recently)</td></tr><tr><td>aarch64</td>
<td>➖</td>
<td>➖</td></tr><tr><td>ppc64le</td>
<td>➖</td>
<td>➖</td></tr><tr><td>...</td>
<td>➖</td>
<td>➖</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>This matrix would be <em>a lot</em> larger if it included historical OSes and less
common architectures, where support with the respective compiler was often in
a 1:1 relationship (i.e. that combination would cover a single cell in the matrix).
The matrix also does not cover which programming languages a given compiler is
able to process, but for simplicity, you can picture C/C++ here.</p>
<p>Of course, GCC remains usable on macOS due to shared Unix roots, there are ways
to make it work on Windows (through cygwin or MinGW), and the whole truth is
way more <a href="https://www.flother.is/til/llvm-target-triple/">complicated</a> still.
But as a first-order approximation, this shouldn't raise too many eyebrows.</p>
<p>Alright, after a full page about compilers, we can hear you thinking:
"What does all this have to do with Python?!".
And you're right, but just one last thing:</p>
<p>Once a program in C/C++/Fortran/etc. has been compiled, there are <em>a lot</em> of
expectations built into that so-called "binary", which will expect very
explicitly-sized inputs, read things from – and load things into – very
specific CPU registers etc.
Basically, at this point, the training wheels come off, and if you use said
binary under even slightly different circumstances (different sized inputs,
changed order of function arguments, different in-memory layout of some
structure etc., much less another CPU type), you're going to have a bad time.
This is the so-called Application Binary Interface
(<a href="https://pypackaging-native.github.io/background/binary_interface">ABI</a>),
and any compiled program is subject to this.</p>
<h2 id="python">Python</h2>
<p>We won't bore you with the history here, but the immediate thing to note is:
you don't need a compiler to use Python. That's a blessing as well as a curse,
because on the one hand, it dramatically lowers the difficulty of using it,
and on the other hand, this makes Python slow compared to compiled languages.</p>
<p>Python's duck-typing means it will go through many layers of wrapping and
fall-backs, before anything actually is executed.
Sidenote: this process is taken care of by Python's interpreter, which – uh oh…
– has itself been compiled<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>.
Unsurprisingly this approach is slower than a compiled program that will just
run with whatever instructions you've given it (and fail, if any part of the
ABI is violated).</p>
<p>This slow-down doesn't matter so much for prototyping, or general scripting,
but it becomes immensely limiting once there's medium-sized or larger amounts
of data involved.
The best-of-both-worlds solution to this problem was to have performant
compiled code under the hood, but a nice, pythonic "wrapper" around it as the
interface towards the programmer.</p>
<p>Remember all that scientific code that had been written in Fortran?
Things like BLAS and LAPACK were already well-established standards for dealing
with common problems in linear algebra, and so it was an obvious choice to
reuse that when libraries like NumPy and SciPy wanted to expose such
functionality to the Python world.
SciPy additionally also used Fortran code to provide special mathematical
functions and other mathematical tools like interpolation &amp; integration – it's
not like the basic math had changed since the 70s…</p>
<p>However, this came with a terrible price:
Users needed a compiler to install the package.
In the early Python days, when many people were on Linux distributions (which
comes with GCC pre-installed), this was less of an issue.
But it made it extraordinarily difficult to do this in a cross-platform way –
particularly on Windows, it's not common for users to have a compiler
installed, much less know how to use it.</p>
<p>It's even worse on the maintainer-side, because they suddenly need to become
experts in the vagaries of different compilers, linkers and runtime libraries
necessary on different platforms, and with sometimes wildly varying behaviour.</p>
<h2 id="python-packaging">Python packaging</h2>
<p>This situation also happens to be <em>the</em> fundamental problem in Python packaging.
There's so much complexity hiding under the surface, that actually dealing with
it in any kind of sane way is really difficult.
For example, the C &amp; C++ ecosystems never managed to standardise any sort of
build &amp; distribution mechanism, and since Python is wrapping around basically
any flavour of C &amp; C++ code, the problems in Python packaging are a <em>superset</em>
of what's already a hugely pressing issue in C/C++.</p>
<p>The packaging world in Python has had to continually reinvent itself in order
to solve these issues.
It's instructive to check out this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQsZsgJ30AE&amp;t=200s">historical</a>
overview, to get a feeling of the many iterations things have gone through.</p>
<p><img src="https://labs.quansight.org/posts/building-scipy-with-flang/ABI_meme.jpg" alt="'A meme about a difficult choice in Python packaging, with a cartoon man sweating under the stress of being unable to decide between two buttons labeled &quot;ABI Hell&quot; and &quot;Users need a compiler&quot;'"></p>
<p>One of the biggest problems over the course of this evolution has been
the question about the right way to distribute a package.
Letting users just download the sources is problematic, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>packages can take a lot of time to build.</li>
<li>if the packages is not just pure Python, the user needs a working compiler
setup (and the source code needs to be compatible with that setup!), which is
a huge usability hurdle.</li>
<li>there's no reliable metadata, because even something as fundamental as the
necessary third-party dependencies used to get populated only through running
<code>setup.py</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The alternative – distributing pre-compiled artefacts – is problematic for many
reasons too, and especially fragile in the face of the above-mentioned ABI.
Given the impact of breaking the ABI (random crashes, heisenbugs, etc.), doing
"binary" distribution haphazardly is not an option.</p>
<p>Eventually, a feasible approach for such distribution emerged in the form of
the "wheel" format, which essentially creates a bubble for each package that
brings along all the required libraries, but hides them from others through a
clever mechanism.
While wheels still have some downsides (especially on the maintainer-side),
they are a massive improvement over the situation that existed before, and
nowadays, most Python packages are installable through wheels from PyPI.</p>
<p>But wheels were not around yet at the time when the Scientific Python community
needed to solve some problems they were facing (as well as not versatile enough
conceptually for solving all the key issues involved).
This <a href="http://technicaldiscovery.blogspot.com/2013/12/why-i-promote-conda.html">blog post</a>
by one of the founding contributors of NumPy and SciPy is full of relevant
anecdotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We in the scientific python community have had difficulty and a rocky history
with just waiting for the Python.org community to solve the [packaging]
problem. With <code>distutils</code> for example, we had to essentially re-write most of
it (as <code>numpy.distutils</code>) in order to support compilation of extensions that
needed Fortran-compiled libraries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite being the product of heroic efforts by many very bright people,
<code>numpy.distutils</code> is generally regarded as a bandaid, and has been in minimal
maintenance mode for years.
This is largely due to fundamental limitations inherent in only having a build
script (e.g. <code>setup.py</code>), without a way to precisely control in advance the
conditions under which a package gets built.
Again from that blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] <code>numpy.distutils</code> replaces most of the innards of <code>distutils</code> but is
still shackled by the architecture and imperative approach to what should
fundamentally be a declarative problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In many ways, this is what led to the creation of conda:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, you can't really address the problem of Python packaging without
addressing the core problems of trying to use <code>distutils</code> (at least for the
NumPy stack). The problems for us in the NumPy stack started there and have
to be rooted out there as well. This was confirmed for me at the first PyData
meetup at Google HQ, where several of us asked Guido [van Rossum; Python's
BDFL at the time] what we can do to fix Python packaging for the NumPy stack.
Guido's answer was to "solve the problem ourselves".</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conda--conda-forge">conda &amp; conda-forge</h2>
<p>Conda was designed to take a more holistic view of all the things that are
required for packaging – including the non-Python bits – and unsurprisingly,
done in a declarative way. The basis for this is a "recipe" that explicitly
defines relevant quantities (e.g. what needs to be present in the build
environment), before the first line of any build script is ever run.</p>
<p>This introduced an unfortunate bifurcation in the Python world, because other
Python tools like pip cannot install conda-packages, yet what conda had done
did not easily fit into the standardisation-by-consensus model<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>, primarily
because many things essential to conda were considered "out of scope" by the
wider Python packaging community.</p>
<p>However, for users and maintainers of packages that are affected by some of the
<a href="https://pypackaging-native.github.io/">deep-seated issues</a> in Python packaging,
it provided a much more powerful solution and got adopted widely – especially
in scientific computing, though by far not everywhere.
While the recipes conda uses are the basis for many key features (e.g. having
enough control to ensure that the ABI is kept consistent, or that packages are
recompiled where necessary), this means in turn that integrating a given
package into the conda world requires creating such a recipe in the first place.</p>
<p>Given the size of the ecosystem, not even a company like Anaconda<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> could
hope to integrate everything that users wanted, and over time, the
community-driven conda-forge channel became <em>the</em> place to do this integration
work.
Anyone can <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/">submit</a> recipes
for a package that is missing, or provide fixes for those that are already
being built on so-called "feedstocks".</p>
<p>One of the things that complicates matters is that conda-forge – as a
philosophy – is aiming to support all common platforms, and even some less
common ones.
This multiplies the kind of problems a Linux distribution might have by at
least ~three, because very often a <em>different</em> set of problems will appear
for macOS and Windows.
To have any chance at success, conda-forge uses the platform defaults
(compiler, standard library, ABI, etc.) wherever possible.</p>
<p>Conda-forge is almost 100% volunteer-run, and dependent on public CI resources
like those provided by Azure Pipelines, as well as Anaconda footing the bill
for the hosting and download traffic of all the hosted artefacts.
On top of that, conda-forge cannot arbitrarily package things where the licence
does not allow it.
There is no hidden layer for build tools; anyone can download and install the
packages that the infrastructure is made of (or the underlying docker images),
and that means conda-forge cannot use proprietary compilers<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup>, but must use
what's freely available.</p>
<p>Remember how we discussed above that all Fortran compilers are proprietary
(except gfortran as part of GCC), and how GCC is not directly usable on Windows?
This has been a huge issue for conda-forge, especially as the expectation of
general support on Windows became more and more wide-spread.
For a very long time, conda-forge was not able to build SciPy at all due to this.
Instead it had to rely on packages from the Anaconda channels<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-6" id="user-content-fnref-6" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup>, until some
particularly talented contributors hacked together an unholy amalgamation of
MSVC (c.f. the default ABI on Windows) and gfortran, first in SciPy
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210616203153/https://pav.iki.fi/blog/2017-10-08/pywingfortran.html">itself</a>
and later on the
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/scipy-feedstock/pull/146">feedstock</a>
in conda-forge.</p>
<h2 id="the-situation">The situation</h2>
<p>To recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>SciPy uses a lot of Fortran code, having incorporated existing and standard
implementations (like BLAS &amp; LAPACK) for mathematical computations.</li>
<li>This did not play well with Python's native build tools, leading to the
creation of <code>numpy.distutils</code>, which is however considered a bandaid and in
minimal maintenance mode.</li>
<li>The Python packaging world has been continually reinventing itself to
overcome burning problems that are due to the immense complexity being
wrapped by Python packages.</li>
<li>A parallel ecosystem has arisen around conda &amp; conda-forge, for packages
and users that were underserved by the standard tools for Python packaging.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where our story starts in earnest.
Going back for many years already, the situation around <code>distutils</code> and
<code>setuptools</code> had been a source of great pain in the Python packaging world.
The two (in close interaction) represented the de-facto standard way of
building Python packages, but changing anything about them was extremely hard
because of how many use-cases had to be considered, how much everything had
grown organically, and so on.</p>
<p>The next evolutionary step turned out to be the combination of PEP517 / PEP518,
which promised a level playing field between various possible build tools, and
a way to specify the required information through a new interface
(<code>pyproject.toml</code>).
This eventually gained enough traction that <code>distutils</code> got scheduled for
removal from the Python standard library per version 3.12.</p>
<p>However, this had far-reaching consequences for all the things in Python-land
which had grown around <code>distutils</code>, and even more so for things layered on top.
The maintainers of <code>numpy.distutils</code> took the decision that they're not going
to maintain this layer going forward – even though <code>setuptools</code> ingested much
of the <code>distutils</code> interface, it did so in ways that were subtly incompatible
with what <code>numpy.distutils</code> did, and ultimately no-one wanted to keep
maintaining this old pile of hacks any longer than absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>This kicked off a flurry of work – already years ago, because NumPy and SciPy
are under excellent stewardship – to find a better solution.
SciPy in particular took a long, hard look at the landscape, and
<a href="https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2021/07/moving-scipy-to-meson">decided</a>
to go with Meson as a build tool, which had a nice Python-style feel to it, and
less of the historic baggage or cumbersome DSL of CMake.
This was a far-reaching and forward-looking decision at the time, not least
because Meson did not yet support all the things that would be necessary to
pull things off.</p>
<p>To put this effort into context, all this required many, many engineering
months of highly talented people over the last ~2.5 years.
Unbeknownst to most, we are benefitting from the great foresight of the SciPy
and NumPy developers in tackling the issue this far in advance, rather than
having an "uh oh" moment once Python 3.12 is released.</p>
<p>It's necessary to note that Meson as a build tool has a much broader audience
than Python developers – it is used widely for C &amp; C++ projects for example<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-7" id="user-content-fnref-7" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">7</a></sup>.
As part of an overall design ideology to bring some much-needed sanity to this
space (and especially the world of C/C++ where no uniform solution exists),
Meson will not let you do things that are sure to go wrong in all but the most
expert hands.</p>
<p>In particular, Meson was going to refuse to accept the MSVC+gfortran
combination that was in use in conda-forge.
In fact, it looked like we were going to be completely boxed in.
As of Python 3.12:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>distutils</code> would be gone, and contemporary <code>setuptools</code> incompatible with
<code>numpy.distutils</code>.</li>
<li>Meson would refuse to work with the hack conda-forge was using.</li>
<li>There were no free (and ABI-compatible) Fortran compilers on Windows <em>at all</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fortran-the-revival">Fortran, the revival</h2>
<p>While Fortran has long been the butt of the joke in IT departments the world
over, in a curious twist of fate, it has seen a dramatic resurgence over the
last few years.
While the reasons for this are not exactly obvious (at least to us!), a few
possible explanations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has relatively simple syntax, and maps well to the structure of
mathematical formulae.</li>
<li>It produces performant code, especially in combination with parallelisation
frameworks like OpenMP.</li>
<li>Due to the large amount of Fortran code in scientific computing, and the
promised performance gains through GPUs, it became an attractive target for
supporting GPU computations.</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, there was renewed vigour in the Fortran compiler space, and several
important developments happened in short succession.
For example, PGI / NVIDIA open sourced a version of their compiler called
pgfortran with a new backend based on LLVM (more on that below), which later
turned into what's now known as "classic" Flang.
In the process of trying to upstream this into LLVM itself, the compiler got
rewritten completely under the name f18, which later turned into "new" Flang
that eventually got merged into LLVM itself.
Pretty much at the
<a href="https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/t/what-is-the-exact-difference-between-llvm-flang-and-lfortran/901/17">same time</a>,
another group started developing a Fortran compiler based on LLVM: LFortran.</p>
<h2 id="llvm--clang">LLVM &amp; Clang</h2>
<p>Further up we had looked at a matrix of Operating Systems versus CPU
architectures, and how most compilers tended to only cover 1-2 "cells", whereas
GCC covered essentially all possible architectures on Linux – i.e. a whole
column of the matrix.</p>
<p>As it happened, the last dimension of universality was tackled by another large
project that grew from a research project into a fully cross-architecture and
cross-platform compiler infrastructure<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-8" id="user-content-fnref-8" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">8</a></sup>: LLVM, and its flagship compiler Clang.
This was an absolutely massive undertaking, but due to its cross-platform
nature, permissive licensing, and modular infrastructure, has become <em>the</em>
focal point of efforts around all kinds of compiler development.</p>
<p>Without going into the technical details, LLVM provides several so-called
"Intermediate Representations" (IRs), which are somewhere in between machine
code and the code that most programmers write, but in a way that is
language-agnostic.
In particular, it would be possible to target the LLVM IRs from Fortran, and
then automatically benefit from all the "backends" that do most of the heavy
optimization work between the IRs and the actual CPU architecture.</p>
<p>This made LLVM an attractive foundation for these new Fortran compiler efforts,
and both incarnations of Flang as well as LFortran followed this approach,
though with different aims in what they built on top.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-bingo">Compiler bingo</h2>
<p>All of these FOSS Fortran compilers attracted great hope to unblock the general
situation regarding the lack of free Fortran compilers on Windows.
Classic Flang already had preliminary support for Windows, but this never fully
took off, not least as the lion's share of resources behind Flang was
refocussed on getting the rewritten version merged into LLVM itself.</p>
<p>But these were not the only changes happening in this space.
For example, Intel did a major overhaul of their Fortran compiler (also basing
it on LLVM), and started making it freely available, though not open source.
Unfortunately this precludes conda-forge from using it, unless Intel themselves
packages the compilers for us;
we <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/intel-compiler-repack-feedstock/issues/15">asked</a>,
but there was no timeline.</p>
<p>Furthermore, through the Mingw-w64 project, it slowly started to become possible
to use gfortran with Microsoft's "Universal C Runtime" (UCRT), which is
essentially the biggest hurdle in achieving ABI-compatibility on Windows.
However, switching out the underlying C standard library would represent a
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/1654">major</a>
overhaul in the MinGW stack for windows within conda-forge, and was also not
something we could count on to be ready in time.</p>
<p>For people on the sidelines like ourselves, this turned into something akin to
"Waiting for Godot" – a seemingly endless period as things kept stretching and
stretching and stretching out further into the future.
To give some perspective, things already seemed "not too far out" 3-4 years
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/961#issuecomment-597094501">ago</a>.</p>
<p>At this point you may be asking yourself:
"wait a second… how did SciPy actually switch to Meson, if there are no Fortran
compilers for Windows?"</p>
<h2 id="how-upstream-scipy-does-it-for-now">How upstream SciPy does it (for now)</h2>
<p>While SciPy has some amount of funding through grants and such, and could
conceivably pay for a compiler licence to use for producing wheels, the
requirements of building things in CI regularly – to avoid the otherwise
inevitable bitrot – would cost a lot and not be a judicious use of the limited
funds available.</p>
<p>What ended up happening is that one lone developer managed to custom-build a
MinGW-based toolchain, carefully adapted to use the right-sized integers and to
conform to the MSVC ABI.
This is enough to pass through Meson's sanity checks (after all, GCC is a
consistent toolchain), however it is again subtly-yet-crucially different from
the requirements that would be necessary for wide-spread use in conda-forge.</p>
<h2 id="conda-forge-and-the-migration-problem">conda-forge and the migration problem</h2>
<p>One final aspect in the whole saga is that conda-forge has some additional
constraints in terms of how large-scale maintenance efforts work, e.g.
something like rolling out a new Python version.
Essentially, this means rebuilding all Python-related feedstocks in the order
how they depend on each other, and the only reasonable way to do it at scale is
to do all OSes and architectures at the same time, as they're all built
simultaneously per feedstock.</p>
<p>So it looked conceivable that we'd end up in a situation where:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have no Windows builds for SciPy, because there's no Fortran compiler
conda-forge can use.</li>
<li>Not being able to rebuild SciPy for Python 3.12 on Windows would either
hold up the migration for at least ~1000 packages that depend on SciPy on
all platforms, or we would have to drop Windows from the Python migration
completely, which would be similarly disruptive and a lot of effort to fix
later.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-pious-hope">A pious hope</h2>
<p>So while the <code>distutils</code> removal was coming down the line like an oncoming
freight train, all we could try to do was cross our fingers that <em>one</em> Fortran
compiler would be ready in time (most likely either llvm-flang or LFortran), and
be as prepared as possible in terms of having all the other pieces ready to go.
LLVM is a big baby, and keeping all the pieces involved up-to-date is a
non-trivial exercise already<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-9" id="user-content-fnref-9" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">9</a></sup>, but we put extra effort into trying to
identify potential problems with Flang early on, both in our own
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/flang-feedstock/pull/27">infrastructure</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/60730">as well as</a>
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/63712">upstream</a>.</p>
<p>But no matter how motivated we were to pursue this, the iron-clad constraints
of FOSS remain at play: no-one can take care of everything, much less keep all
the required knowledge in their head.
That means we need other people's input &amp; feedback – and when everyone's a
volunteer<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-10" id="user-content-fnref-10" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">10</a></sup>, things can take a while.</p>
<p>As it happened, the release of LLVM 17.0 was coming up, which would be the first
release where Flang had matured enough to remove the <code>-flang-experimental-exec</code>
flag, and was <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/proposal-rename-flang-new-to-flang/69462/33">estimated</a>
to be roughly "0.8 level maturity".
As soon as we had the release candidates built in conda-forge, we tried to throw
it at SciPy, only to realise that Meson did not support the new Flang yet.</p>
<p>Even worse, it wasn't clear which ABI Flang was using (as mentioned above,
conda-forge uses the default ABI on Windows everywhere), not least because the
Clang driver which Flang uses under the hood can target both modes.
Unfortunately, it wasn't clear which mode was being chosen, and generally it
looked like Windows support was (as often happens in FOSS) the least mature
platform.</p>
<p>To top it off, there are also two different standard libraries, two different
runtime libraries and two different linkers to consider in all this – all of
which had the potential to lead to subtle breakage.
At this point, we still hadn't compiled more than a "Hello World!" example with
Flang, so it wasn't even clear that it could compile all of SciPy, much less
pass the test suite...</p>
<h2 id="eucatastrophe">Eucatastrophe</h2>
<p>The final push came once SciPy got <a href="https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/19317">ready</a>
to remove support for <code>setup.py</code>, the last link to the "old world" before the
removal of <code>distutils</code>.
With some kind hints from the Meson devs and a bit of persistence, we managed to
teach Meson to be able to handle llvm-flang just enough to compile something.
We eventually passed the first build, and after some more wrangling with Meson,
the first installation too.</p>
<p>What happened next felt like nothing short of magical – while we were expecting
test failures, hangs or even crashes, the test suite… just passed 100%?!</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span> ........................................................................ [ 99%]</span></p></div><div><p><span> .................................................s.......

<p>55'000 tests, and not a single failure? When does that ever happen on the first
try after major surgery?</p>
<p>Somehow, armed only with a pre-release of a still-experimental compiler and a
hastily patched-up build system, we managed to dodge the freight train, and the
migration in conda-forge could progress past SciPy with no more than a few days
delay, rather than being stuck for months.
In the end, the respective SciPy builds in conda-forge were available two days
after the release of Python 3.12.0.</p>
<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>At the end of this journey, we can only marvel at how long and winding the ways
have been that lead us here.
Depending on where you draw the line, hundreds or even thousands of person
years of effort went into the ingredients that were necessary for us to achieve
the final result (SciPy, Meson, Flang, LLVM, LAPACK etc.).
We cannot realistically thank everyone, but a few call-outs nevertheless:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ralf Gommers, for tirelessly positive support and for outstanding
stewardship of NumPy and SciPy, and driving the massive effort to move
SciPy to Meson.</li>
<li>Isuru Fernando, for building &amp; maintaining some of the trickiest pieces in
conda-forge, and consistently helping out with keeping them running or
building on top of them, as well as reviewing with incredible expertise.</li>
<li>The Meson developers, for a clean build system with a solid design philosophy.</li>
<li>The Flang developers, for providing the world with an open source Fortran
compiler that also works on Windows.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We are also very grateful that this work was supported in part by a grant from
NASA to SciPy, scikit-learn, pandas and NumPy under the NASA ROSES 2020 program.</em></p>
<p>PS. In case you're still wondering what the "eu" in eucatastrophe
<a href="https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Eucatastrophe">means</a>, it's a neologism coined
by J. R. R. Tolkien from Greek ευ- "good" and καταστροφή "sudden turn".
Quoting from the link above: "In essence, a eucatastrophe is a massive turn in
fortune from a seemingly unconquerable situation to an unforeseen victory,
usually brought by grace rather than heroic effort.
Such a turn is catastrophic in the sense of its breadth and surprise and
positive in that a great evil or misfortune is averted."</p>
