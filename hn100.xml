<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement is expanding plans to outsource <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-collecting-immigrant-data-surveil-track/">immigrant tracking</a> to private surveillance firms, scrapping a recent $180 million pilot proposal in favor of a no-cap program with multimillion-dollar guarantees, according to new contracting records reviewed by WIRED.</p><p>Late last month, the Intercept reported that <a data-offer-url="https://theintercept.com/2025/10/31/ice-plans-cash-rewards-for-private-bounty-hunters-to-locate-and-track-immigrants/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://theintercept.com/2025/10/31/ice-plans-cash-rewards-for-private-bounty-hunters-to-locate-and-track-immigrants/&quot;}" href="https://theintercept.com/2025/10/31/ice-plans-cash-rewards-for-private-bounty-hunters-to-locate-and-track-immigrants/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ICE intends to hire bounty hunters and private investigators</a> for street-level verification work. Contractors would confirm home and work addresses for people targeted for removal by—among other techniques—photographing residences, documenting comings and goings, and staking out workplaces and apartment complexes.</p><p>Those filings cast the initiative as a substantial but limited pilot program. Contractors were guaranteed as little as $250 and could earn no more than $90 million each, with the overall program capped at $180 million. That structure pointed to meaningful scale but still framed the effort as a controlled trial, not an integral component of ICE’s removal operations.</p><p>Newly released amendments dismantle that structure. ICE has removed the program’s spending cap and replaced it with dramatically higher per-vendor limits. Contractors may now earn up to $281.25 million individually and are guaranteed an initial task order worth at least $7.5 million. The shift signals to ICE’s contracting base that this is no longer an experiment, but an investment, and that the agency expects prime-tier contractors to stand up the staffing, technology, and field operations needed to function as a de facto arm of federal enforcement.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment.</p><p>The proposed scope was already large. It described contractors receiving monthly recurring batches of 50,000 cases drawn from a docket of 1.5 million people. Private investigators would confirm individuals’ locations not only through commercial data brokers and open-source research, but via in-person visits when required. The filings outline a performance-based structure with bounty-like incentives: Firms will be paid a fixed price per case, plus bonuses for speed and accuracy, with vendors expected to propose their own incentive rates.</p><p>The contract also authorizes the Department of Justice and other DHS components to issue their own orders under the program.</p><p>Previous filings hinted that private investigators might receive access to ICE’s internal case-management systems—databases that contain photos, biographical details, immigration histories, and other enforcement notes. The amended filings reverse that, stating that contractors will not be permitted inside agency systems under any circumstance. Instead, DHS will send contractors exported case packets containing a range of personal data on each target. This change limits direct exposure to federal systems, but still places large volumes of sensitive information in the hands of private surveillance firms operating outside public oversight.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The proposal is only the latest effort by the Trump administration to dramatically broaden the role of contractors inside ICE’s enforcement operations. WIRED first reported plans last month to install a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-is-building-a-24-7-shadow-transportation-network-across-texas/">contractor-run transportation network</a> across the state of Texas, staffed by armed teams moving detainees around the clock. Earlier this fall, the agency sought a private vendor to staff <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-social-media-surveillance-24-7-contract/">two 24/7 social media “targeting centers,”</a> where contract analysts would scan platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and X for leads to feed directly into detention operations. And a separate proposal this month called for a <a data-offer-url="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-call-center-unaccompanied-minors-trump-rcna242313" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-call-center-unaccompanied-minors-trump-rcna242313&quot;}" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-call-center-unaccompanied-minors-trump-rcna242313" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">privately run national call center</a>, operated almost entirely by an industry partner, to field up to 7,000 enforcement calls per day with only minimal federal staff on site.</p><p>Ultimately, the escalation in ICE’s private surveillance commitments reflects a basic reality—that few contractors will marshal the workforce, logistics, and infrastructure the agency demands without substantial assurances. By boosting guarantees and eliminating the cap, ICE can now fast-track an effort to place contract surveillance agents throughout its enforcement pipeline.</p></div></div>]]></description>

      <h2>What is Unison?</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Unison is a programming language built around <a href="https://www.unison-lang.org/docs/the-big-idea/">one big idea</a>: let's identify a definition by its actual contents, <strong>not</strong> just by the human-friendly name that also referred to older versions of the definition. Our ecosystem leverages this core idea from the ground up. Some benefits: we never compile the same code twice; many versioning conflicts simply <em>aren't</em>; and we're able to build sophisticated self-deploying distributed systems within a single strongly-typed program.</p>
      <p>Unison code lives in a database—your "codebase"—rather than in text files. The human-friendly names are in the codebase too, but they're materialized as text only when reading or editing your code.</p>

    <div>
    <faq-item><details>
  <summary>
    
    <span>Why make a whole new programming language? Couldn't you add Unison's features to another language?</span>
  </summary>
  <div>
      <p>
        Unison's hash-based, database-backed representation changes how code is identified, versioned, and shared. As a consequence, the workflow, toolchain, and deployment model are not add-ons; they emerge naturally from the language's design. In theory, you could try to retrofit these ideas onto another language, but doing so might be fragile, difficult to make reliable in production, and would likely require rewriting major parts of the existing tooling while restricting language features.

    <faq-item><details>
  <summary>
    
    <span>Is anyone using Unison in prod?</span>
  </summary>
  <p>Yes, <strong>we</strong> are! Our entire Cloud orchestration layer is written entirely in Unison, and it has powered Unison Cloud from day one.</p>

    <span>I'm concerned about vendor lock-in; do I have to use Unison Cloud to deploy my services?</span>

</faq-item>
    <faq-item><details>
  <summary>
    
    <span>What does collaborating look like in Unison?</span>
  </summary>
  <div>
      <p>Unison Share supports organizations, tickets, code contributions (pull requests), code review, and more.</p>
        <p>In many ways Unison's story for collaboration outstrips the status quo of developer tooling. e.g. merge conflicts only happen when two people actually modify the same definition; not because you moved some stuff around in your files.</p>
    </div>
</details>


</faq-item>
    <faq-item><details>
  <summary>
    
    <span>How does version control work in the absence of Git?</span>
  </summary>
  <p>Unison implements a native version control system: with projects, branches, clone, push, pull, merge, etc.</p>
</details>


</faq-item>
    <faq-item><details>
  <summary>
    
    <span>Do I have to use a specific IDE?</span>
  </summary>
  <p>No, you can pick any IDE that you're familiar with. Unison exposes an LSP server and many community members have contributed <a href="https://www.unison-lang.org/docs/usage-topics/editor-setup/">their own editor setups here</a>.</p>

    <span>What about interop with other languages?</span>
  </summary>

    <faq-item><details>
  <summary>
    
    <span>Without files, how do I see my codebase?</span>
  </summary>
  <p>Your codebase structure is viewable with the <a href="https://www.unison-lang.org/docs/tooling/ucm-desktop/">Unison Desktop app</a>. The UCM Desktop app also features click-through to definition tooling and rich rendering of docs.</p>

Nevertheless, as Google has indicated that they are already aware of data exfiltration risks exemplified by our research, we did not undertake responsible disclosure.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">In the last 15 years, the market has given developers more options than ever for every single part of their stack. But when it comes to payments, there have been virtually zero new entrants. The existing options are slim, and almost all of them require us to talk to sales to even set up an account. When it comes to <em>self-serve</em> payments, there are even fewer options.</p>
<p dir="auto">The result? The developer experience and cost of payments has barely improved in that time. Best in class DX in payments feels eerily suspended in 2015. Meanwhile, we've enjoyed constant improvements in auth, compute, hosting, and practically everything else.</p>
<p dir="auto">Flowglad wants to change that.</p>
<p dir="auto">We're building a payments layer that lets you:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Think about billing and payments as little as possible</li>
<li>Spend as little time on integration and maintenance as possible</li>
<li>Get as much out of your single integration as possible</li>
<li>Unlock more payment providers from a single integration</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Achieving this mission will take time. It will be hard. It might even make some people unhappy. But with AI bringing more and more developers on line and exploding the complexity of startup billing, the need is more urgent than ever.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/orion">https://blog.kagi.com/orion</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46047350">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            <p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-25/1764079669-552357-1.png" alt="Kagi search interface displayed on the Orion Browser on laptop, tablet, and smartphone"></p>

<p>After six years of relentless development, <strong>Orion for MacOS 1.0 is here</strong>.</p>

<p>What started as a vision initiated by our founder, Vladimir Prelovac, has now come to fruition on Mac, iPhone, and iPad. Today, Orion for macOS officially leaves its beta phase behind and joins our iOS and iPadOS apps as a fully‑fledged, production‑ready browser.</p>

<p>While doing so, it expands Kagi ecosystem of privacy-respecting, user-centric products (that we have begun fondly naming “Kagiverse”) to now include: <a href="https://kagi.com/">Search</a>, <a href="https://kagi.com/assistant">Assistant</a>, <a href="https://orionbrowser.com/">Browser</a>, <a href="https://translate.kagi.com/">Translate</a>, <a href="https://news.kagi.com/">News</a> with more to come.</p>

<p>We built Orion for people who feel that modern browsing has drifted too far from serving the user. This is our invitation to <strong>browse beyond ✴︎ the status quo</strong>.</p>

<h2>Why a new browser?</h2>

<p>The obvious question is: <strong>why <em>the heck</em> do we need a new browser?</strong> The world already has Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, and a growing list of “AI browsers.” Why add yet another?</p>

<p>Because something fundamental has been lost.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Zero telemetry, privacy‑first access to the internet: a basic human right.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your browser is the most intimate tool you have on your computer. It sees everything you read, everything you search, everything you type. Do you want that relationship funded by advertisers, or by you?</p>

<p>With ad‑funded browsers and AI overlays, your activity is a gold mine. Every click becomes a way to track, every page another opportunity to profile you a little more deeply. We believe there needs to be a different path: <strong>a browser that answers only to its user.</strong></p>

<p>Orion is our attempt at that browser. No trade-offs between features and privacy. It’s fast, customizable, and uncompromising on both fronts.</p>

<h2>A bold technical choice: WebKit, not another Chromium clone</h2>

<p>In a world dominated by Chromium, choosing a rendering engine is an act of resistance.</p>

<p>From day one, we made the deliberate choice to build Orion on <a href="https://webkit.org/"><strong>WebKit</strong></a>, the open‑source engine at the heart of Safari and the broader Apple ecosystem. It gives us:</p>

<ul>
<li>A high‑performance engine that is <strong>deeply optimized for macOS and iOS</strong>.</li>
<li>An alternative to the growing Chromium monoculture.</li>
<li>A foundation that is not controlled by an advertising giant.</li>
</ul>

<p>Orion may feel familiar if you’re used to Safari – respecting your muscle memory and the aesthetics of macOS and iOS – but it is an entirely different beast under the hood. We combined native WebKit speed with a completely new approach to extensions, privacy, and customization.</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-25/1764079784-790203-orion-safari.png" alt="Orion and Safari browser windows displaying extension management interfaces with popular extensions listed"></p>

<h2>Speed by nature, privacy by default</h2>

<p>Most people switch browsers for one reason: <strong>speed</strong>.</p>

<p>Orion is designed to be fast by nature, not just in benchmarks, but in how it feels every day:</p>

<ul>
<li>A lean, native codebase without ad‑tech bloat.</li>
<li>Optimized startup, tab switching, and page rendering.</li>
<li>A UI that gets out of your way and gives you more screen real estate for content.</li>
</ul>

<p>Alongside speed, we treat privacy as a first‑class feature:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Zero Telemetry</strong>: We don’t collect usage data. No analytics, no identifiers, no tracking.</li>
<li><strong>No ad or tracking technology</strong> baked in: Orion is not funded by ads, so there is no incentive to follow you around the web.</li>
<li><strong>Built‑in protections</strong>: Strong content blocking and privacy defaults from the first launch.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Speed. Extensions. Privacy. Pick all three.</h2>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-25/1764079906-671487-settings.png" alt="Orion browser Privacy settings panel showing tracker removal, history deletion, cookie management, crash report options, and content blocker configuration."></p>

<h2>Thoughtful AI, security first</h2>

<p>We are excited about what AI can do for search, browsing, and productivity. Kagi, the company behind Orion, has been experimenting with AI‑powered tools for years while staying true to our <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/why-kagi/ai-philosophy.html">AI integration philosophy</a>.</p>

<p>But we are also watching a worrying trend: AI agents are being rushed directly into the browser core, with deep access to everything you do online – and sometimes even to your local machine.</p>

<p>Security researchers have already documented serious issues in early AI browsers and “agentic” browser features:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://labs.sqrx.com/comet-mcp-api-allows-ai-browsers-to-execute-local-commands-dec185fb524b">Hidden or undocumented APIs</a> that allowed embedded AI components to execute arbitrary local commands on users’ devices.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@mdmeeng01/perplexitys-comet-got-hijacked-by-hidden-prompts-and-it-changed-how-i-think-about-ai-browsers-fb22b673ece9">Prompt‑injection attacks</a> that trick AI agents into ignoring safety rules, visiting malicious sites, or leaking sensitive information beyond what traditional browser sandboxes were designed to protect.</li>
<li>Broader concerns that some implementations are effectively “<a href="https://medium.com/utopian/perplexity-was-supposed-to-change-search-instead-its-lighting-everything-on-fire-922379e72083">lighting everything on fire</a>” by expanding the browser’s attack surface and data flows in ways users don’t fully understand.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our stance is simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>We are not against AI, and we are conscious of <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/llms">its limitations</a>. We already integrate with AI‑powered services wherever it makes functional sense and will continue to expand those capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>We are against rushing insecure, always‑on agents into the browser core.</strong> Your browser should be a secure gateway, not an unvetted co‑pilot wired into everything you do.</li>
</ul>

<p>So today:</p>

<ul>
<li>Orion ships with <strong>no built‑in AI code</strong> in its core.</li>
<li>We focus on providing a clean, predictable environment, <strong>especially for enterprises and privacy‑conscious professionals</strong>.</li>
<li>Orion is designed to connect seamlessly to the AI tools you choose – soon including Kagi’s intelligent features – while keeping a clear separation between your browser and any external AI agents.</li>
</ul>

<p>As AI matures and security models improve, we’ll continue to evaluate thoughtful, user‑controlled ways to bring AI into your workflow without compromising safety, privacy or user choice.</p>

<h2>Simple for everyone, limitless for experts</h2>

<p>We designed Orion to bridge the gap between simplicity and power. Out of the box, it’s a clean, intuitive browser for anyone. Under the hood, it’s a deep toolbox for people who live in their browser all day.</p>

<p>Some of the unique features you’ll find in Orion 1.0:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Focus Mode</strong>: Instantly transform any website into a distraction‑free web app. Perfect for documentation, writing, or web apps you run all day.
<img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-25/1764079998-879831-focusmode.gif" alt="Browser window showing Focus Mode being activated, simplifying webpage content by removing distractions."></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Link Preview</strong>: Peek at content from any app – email, notes, chat – without fully committing to opening a tab, keeping your workspace tidy.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Mini Toolbar, Overflow Menu, and Page Tweak</strong>: Fine‑tune each page’s appearance and controls, so the web adapts to you, not the other way around.</p></li>

<p>For power users, we’ve added granular options throughout the browser. These are there when you want them, and out of your way when you don’t.</p>

<p>Orion 1.0 also reflects six years of <a href="https://orionfeedback.org/">feedback</a> from early adopters. Many invisible improvements – tab stability, memory behavior, complex web app compatibility – are a direct result of people pushing Orion hard in their daily workflows and telling us what broke.</p>

<h2>Browse Beyond ✴︎: our new signature</h2>

<p>With this release, we are introducing our new signature: <strong>Browse Beyond ✴︎</strong>.</p>

<p>We originally started with the browser name ‘Kagi.’ On February 3, 2020, Vlad suggested a shortlist for rebranding: Comet, Core, Blaze, and Orion. We chose Orion not just for the name itself, but because it perfectly captured our drive for exploration and curiosity. It was a natural fit that set the stage for everything that followed.</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-25/1764080256-734784-orionlogo-search.png" alt="Evolution of logo designs from water droplet through rocket, astronaut, infinity symbol, lighthouse, robot, to final cosmic sphere design."></p>

<p>You’ll see this reflected in our refreshed visual identity:</p>

<ul>
<li>A star (✴︎) motif throughout our communication.</li>
<li>A refined logo that now uses <strong>the same typeface as Kagi</strong>, creating a clear visual bond between our browser and our search engine.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-25/1764080330-747115-kagi-orion.png" alt="Kagi logo on orange background next to Orion browser logo with star icon and “Browse Beyond” tagline on purple background."></p>

<p>Orion is part of the broader <strong>Kagi ecosystem</strong>, united by a simple idea: the internet should be built for people, not advertisers or any other third parties.</p>

<h2>Small team, sustainable model</h2>

<p>Orion is built by a team of just six developers.</p>

<p>To put that in perspective:</p>

<ul>
<li>That’s roughly 10% of the size of the “small” browser teams at larger companies.</li>
<li>And a rounding error compared to the teams behind Chrome or Edge.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet, the impact is real: over <strong>1 million downloads to date</strong>, and a dedicated community of <a href="https://kagi.com/stats?stat=orion">2480</a> paid subscribers who make this independence possible.</p>

<p>For the first two years, development was carried out by a single developer. Today, we are a tight knit group operating close to our users. We listen, debate, and implement fixes proposed directly by our community on <a href="https://orionfeedback.org/">OrionFeedback.org</a>.</p>

<p>This is our only source of decision making, rather than any usage analytics or patterns, because remember, Orion is zero-telemetry!</p>

<p>This small team approach lets us move quickly, stay focused, and avoid the bloat or hype that often comes with scale.</p>

<h2>Free, yet self‑funded</h2>

<p><strong>Orion is free for everyone.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Every user also receives 200 free Kagi searches</strong>, with no account or sign‑up required. It’s our way of introducing you to fast, ad‑free, privacy‑respecting search from day one.</p>

<p>But we are also 100% self‑funded. We don’t sell your data and we don’t take money from advertisers, which means we rely directly on our users to sustain the project.</p>

<p>There are three ways to <a href="https://kagi.com/onboarding?p=orion_plan">contribute to Orion’s future</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tip Jar (from the app): A simple way to say “thank you” without any commitment.</li>
<li>Supporter Subscription: $5/month or $50/year.</li>
<li>Lifetime Access: A one‑time payment of $150 for life.</li>
</ul>

<p>Supporters (via subscription or lifetime purchase) unlock a set of <strong>Orion+</strong> perks available today, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Floating windows: Keep a video or window on top of other apps.</li>
<li>Customization: Programmable buttons and custom application icons.</li>
<li>Early access to new, supporter‑exclusive features we’re already building for next year.</li>
</ul>

<p>By supporting Orion, you’re not just funding a browser – you are co‑funding a better web with humans at the center.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p><strong>I</strong>.</p><p>On Friday, the Hard Fork team published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">our interview</a> with Roblox CEO David Baszucki. In the days since, it has become the most-discussed interview we've done in three years on the show. Listeners who wrote in to us said they were shocked to hear the leader of a platform with 151.5 million monthly users, most of them minors, express frustration and annoyance at being asked about the company's history of failures related to child safety. Journalists described the interview as "<a href="https://news.google.com/read/CBMidkFVX3lxTE4xNlk2SVc0YWJhRXF1Z2NUa1RJZFhRYzhCclk3Z2d2VFVkY2JsQUVIa1A4QUJJSGlFcnIwYjFNZ2hEV3JaMG4ycWxvX2YyMlpJeEVOaGhDLWZyamRGWS03MFEwalB0cDRtLU5uM3FFRnNaUjRpS2c?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US%3Aen&amp;ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">bizarre</a>," "<a href="https://news.google.com/read/CBMi4wFBVV95cUxOTUlxUlVyeFhrRk9XSDd1enBzcmVnbm9uVFVoOGlnUUdLcE9VT291SndCT0RVUlY2ZmJMOFh5bG9lZ2VpVDQ3WkFhMTFXcTJTaUhxTjd2b2NrT0lFeWlLeUxiUEd3Sk1yeEgwYTlTcG1PdnAtNnlBNHdYV1lEejYtODU5RlZUa1Z6VzJrcnFXeGtTbGpQR2hIRXRqcWZzMGhpTzRnVlNsaERmcmxBZWcwdEtJejRfVkhQYUdTQmZNUl9PdEVKUUZkVHBfT3RXUFRUMURIc0ZiZ20zLVY4Z3ZfNENKaw?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US%3Aen&amp;ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">unhinged</a>," and a "<a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-new-york-times-interview-baszucki-2000646174?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">car crash</a>." </p><p>And a case can be made that it was all of those things — even if Baszucki, in the studio afterwards and <a href="https://x.com/DavidBaszucki/status/1991944434330800427?s=20&amp;ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">later on X</a>, insisted to us that he had had a good time. In the moment, though, Baszucki's dismissive attitude toward discussing child safety struck me as something worse: familiar.</p><p>Baszucki, after all, is not the first CEO to have insisted to me that a platform's problems are smaller than I am making them out to be. Nor is he the first to blame the platform's enormous scale, or to try to change the subject. (He is the first tech CEO to suggest to me that maybe there should be prediction markets in video games for children, but that's another story.)</p><p>What people found noteworthy about our interview, I think, was the fresh evidence that our most successful tech CEOs really do think and talk this way. Given a chance to display empathy for the victims of crimes his platform enabled, or to convey regret about historical safety lapses, or even just to gesture at some sense of responsibility for the hundreds of millions of children who in various ways are depending on him, the CEO throws up his hands and asks: how long are you guys going to be going on about all this stuff? </p><p>Roblox is different from other social products in that it explicitly courts users as young as 5. (You are supposed to be at least 13 to use Instagram, TikTok, and other major platforms.) That has always put significant pressure on the company to develop serious safety features. The company <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/tr/newsroom/2024/07/driving-civility-and-safety-for-all-users?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">says</a> it spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year on safety, and that 10 percent of its employees work on trust and safety issues. And trust and safety workers I know tell me that they respect Roblox's safety teams.</p><p>At the same time, this is a platform launched in 2006 where, for most of its history, adults could freely approach and message any minor unless their parents had dug into the app settings. Roblox did not verify users' ages, letting any child identify as 13 or older to bypass content restrictions. Filters intended to prevent inappropriate chat or the exchange of personal information were easily bypassed by slightly changing the spelling of words. Parental controls could be circumvented simply by a child creating a new account and declaring that they were at least 13.</p><p>Last year the company introduced new restrictions on chat. And this year, the company said it would deploy <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">its own age estimation technology</a> to determine users' ages and restrict the content available to them accordingly. This rollout was the main reason we had sought to interview Baszucki in the first place — something we had communicated to his team.</p><p>Which only made it stranger when Baszucki expressed surprise at our line of inquiry and threw his PR team under the bus. ("If our PR people said, “Let’s talk about age-gating for an hour,' I’m up for it, but I love your pod. I thought I came here to talk about everything,'" he said.)</p><p>Since 2018, at least two dozen people in the United States have been arrested and accused of abducting or abusing victims they met on Roblox, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">according to a 2024 investigation by Bloomberg</a>. Attorneys general in Texas, Kentucky, and Louisiana have filed lawsuits against Roblox alleging that the platform facilitates child exploitation and grooming. More than 35 families have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-rules-online-platform-roblox-keeping-alleged-abuse/story?id=127190227&amp;ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">filed lawsuits</a> against the company over child predation.</p><p>As recently as this month, a reporter for the <em>Guardian</em> created an account presenting herself as a child and found that in Roblox <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/05/roblox-game-robux-children-child-kids-safety-parental-controls?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="noreferrer">she could wander user-created strip clubs</a>, casinos, and horror games. In one "hangout" game, in which she identified as a 13-year-old, another avatar sexually assaulted her by thrusting his hips into her avatar's face as she begged him to leave her alone.</p><p>It's true that any platform that lets strangers communicate will lead to real-world harm. I believe that millions of children use Roblox daily without incident. And we would not want to shut down the entire internet to prevent a single bad thing from ever happening. </p><p>But there is much a leader can do with the knowledge that his platform will inevitably lead to harm, should he wish. </p><p>Understanding how attractive Roblox would be to predators, the company long ago could have blocked unrestricted contact between adults and minors. It could have adopted age verification before a wave of state legislation signaled that it would soon become mandatory anyway. It could have made it harder for children under 13 to create new accounts, and require them to get parental consent in a way it could verify.</p><p>But doing so would require Roblox to focus on outcomes for children, at the likely expense of growth. And so here we are.</p><p><strong>II</strong>.</p><p>Galling? Yes. But like I said: it's also familiar. </p><p>Over and over again, we have seen leaders in Baszucki's position choose growth over guardrails. Safety features come out years after the need for them is identified, if at all. Internal critics are sidelined, laid off, or managed out. And when journalists ask, politely but insistently, why so many of their users are suffering, executives laugh and tell us that we're the crazy ones.</p><p>Look at OpenAI, where the company is reckoning with the fact that making its models less sycophantic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/23/technology/openai-chatgpt-users-risks.html?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">has been worse for user engagement</a> — and is building new features to turn the engagement dial back up.</p><p>Look at TikTok, which has answered concerns that short-form video is <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11588245/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="noreferrer">worsening academic performance for children</a> with new "digital well-being features" that include an affirmation journal, a "background sound generator aimed at improving the mental health of its users," and "new badges to reward people who use the platform within limits, especially teens." Answering concerns that teens are using the app too much with more reasons to use the app.</p><p>Or look at Meta, where new court filings from over the weekend allege ... <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/meta-buried-causal-evidence-social-media-harm-us-court-filings-allege-2025-11-23/?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">a truly staggering number of things</a>. To name a few: the company "stalled internal efforts to prevent child predators from contacting minors for years due to growth concerns," according to Jeff Horwitz in Reuters; "recognized that optimizing its products to increase teen engagement resulted in serving them more harmful content, but did so anyway"; and gave users 17 attempts to traffic people for sex before banning their accounts. (Meta denies the allegations, which are drawn from internal documents that have not been made public; Meta has also objected to unsealing the documents.) </p><p>Lawsuits will always contain the most salacious allegations lawyers can find, of course. But what struck me about these latest filings is not the lawyers' predictably self-serving framing but rather the quotes from Meta's own employees.</p><p>When the company declined to publish internal research from 2019 which showed that no longer looking at Facebook and Instagram improved users' mental health, one employee said: "If the results are bad and we don’t publish and they leak ... is it going to look like tobacco companies doing research and knowing cigs were bad and then keeping that info to themselves?”</p><p>When Meta researchers found that by 2018, approximately 40 percent of children ages 9 to 12 were daily Instagram users — despite the fact that you are supposed to be 13 to join — some employees bristled at what they perceived as tacit encouragement from executives to accelerate growth efforts among children. </p><p>"Oh good, we’re going after &lt;13 year olds now?” one wrote, as cited in <a href="https://time.com/7336204/meta-lawsuit-files-child-safety/?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer"><em>Time</em>'s account of the brief</a>. “Zuck has been talking about that for a while...targeting 11 year olds feels like tobacco companies a couple decades ago (and today). Like we’re seriously saying ‘we have to hook them young’ here.” </p><p>When Meta studied the potential of its products to be addictive in 2018, it found that 55 percent of 20,000 surveyed users showed at least some signs of "problematic use." When it published that research the following year, though, it redefined "problematic use" to include only the most severe cases — 3.1 percent of users.</p><p>&nbsp;“Because our product exploits weaknesses in the human psychology to promote product engagement and time spent,” a user experience researcher wrote, the company should “alert people to the effect that the product has on their brain.”</p><p>You will not be surprised to learn that the company did not alert people to the issue.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>As usual, the rank-and-file employees are doing their job. Over and over again, though, their boss' boss tells them to stop.</p><p>The thing is, platforms' strategy of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">delay, deny and deflect</a> mostly works. </p><p>Americans have short attention spans — and lots to worry about. The tech backlash that kicked off in 2017 inspired platforms to make meaningful and effective investments in content moderation, cybersecurity, platform integrity, and other teams that worked to protect their user bases. Imperfect as these efforts were, they bolstered my sense that tech platforms were susceptible to pressure from the public, from lawmakers and from journalists. They acted slowly, and incompletely, but at least they acted.</p><p>Fast forward to today and the bargain no longer holds. Platforms do whatever the president of the United States tells them to do, and very little else. Shame, that once-great regulator of social norms and executive behavior, has all but disappeared from public life. In its place is denial, defiance, and the noxious vice signaling of the investor class.</p><p>I'm still reckoning with what it means to do journalism in a world where the truth can barely hold anyone's attention — much less hold a platform accountable, in any real sense of that word. I'm rethinking how to cover tech policy at a time when it is being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/technology/meta-mark-zuckerberg-trump.html?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">made by whim</a>. I'm noticing the degree to which platforms wish to be judged only by their stated intentions, and almost never on the outcomes of anyone who uses them. </p><p>In the meantime the platforms hurtle onward, pitching ever-more fantastical visions of the future while seeming barely interested in stewarding the present.</p><p>For the moment, I'm grateful that a car-crash interview drew attention to one CEO's exasperation with being asked about that. But the real problem isn't that David Baszucki talks this way. It's that so many of his peers do, too.</p><figure><img src="https://www.platformer.news/content/images/2024/05/floating_linebreak_600px-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="600" height="157" srcset="https://www.platformer.news/content/images/2024/05/floating_linebreak_600px-1.png 600w"></figure><p><strong>Sponsored</strong></p><h3 id="unknown-number-calling-it%E2%80%99s-not-random%E2%80%A6">Unknown number calling?

The move, <a href="https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1992335925322613127?ref=platformer.news"><u>according to</u></a> X head of product <strong>Nikita Bier</strong>, “is an important first step to securing the integrity of the global town square.”</p><p>But the feature has had an unintended consequence: it revealed that big pro-Trump accounts like <strong>@MAGANationX</strong>, a right-wing user with nearly 400,000 followers that regularly shares news about US politics, aren't actually based in the US. MAGANationX, for example, is based in <strong>Eastern Europe</strong>, according to X.&nbsp;</p><p>Other popular right-wing accounts — that use names from the Trump family — like <strong>@IvankaNews_ </strong>(1 million followers before it was suspended), <strong>@BarronTNews</strong> (nearly 600,000 followers), and <strong>@TrumpKaiNews</strong> (more than 11,000 followers), appear to be based in <strong>Nigeria</strong>, Eastern Europe, and <strong>Macedonia</strong> respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>The data could be skewed by travel, VPNs, or old IP addresses, and some have complained their location is inaccurate. Bier said the rollout has “a few rough edges” that will be resolved by Tuesday.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why we’re following: </strong>One of <strong>Elon Musk</strong>’s promises during the takeover of Twitter was to purge the platform of inauthentic accounts. But several studies <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/x-new-location-transparency-feature-questions-origins-maga-accounts-rcna245487?ref=platformer.news"><u>have shown</u></a> that suspected inauthentic activity has remained at about the same levels. X has long struggled with troll farms spreading misinformation, boosted by its tendency to monetarily reward engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>There's also an irony in the fact that revealing the origins of ragebait-posting political accounts like these was once the subject of groundbreaking research by the Stanford Internet Observatory and other academic researchers. But the effort outraged Republicans, which then <a href="https://www.platformer.news/stanford-internet-observatory-shutdown-stamos-diresta-sio/" rel="noreferrer">sued them over their contacts with the government about information operations like these</a> and largely succeeded in stopping the work. </p><p><strong>What people are saying: </strong>Accusations of foreign actors spreading fake news flew on both sides of the aisle.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://bfl.ai/blog/flux-2">https://bfl.ai/blog/flux-2</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46046916">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FLUX.2 is designed for real-world creative workflows, not just demos or party tricks. It generates high-quality images while maintaining character and style consistency across multiple reference images, following structured prompts, reading and writing complex text, adhering to brand guidelines, and reliably handling lighting, layouts, and logos. FLUX.2 can edit images at up to 4 megapixels while preserving detail and coherence.</p><h2><strong>Black Forest Labs: Open Core</strong></h2><p>We believe visual intelligence should be shaped by researchers, creatives, and developers everywhere, not just a few. That’s why we pair frontier capability with open research and open innovation, releasing powerful, inspectable, and composable open-weight models for the community, alongside robust, production-ready endpoints for teams that need scale, reliability, and customization.</p><p>When we launched Black Forest Labs in 2024, we set out to make open innovation sustainable, building on our experience developing some of the world’s most popular open models. We’ve combined open models like FLUX.1 [dev]—<a target="_blank" rel="noindex nofollow" href="https://huggingface.co/models?sort=likes">the most popular open image model globally</a>—with professional-grade models like FLUX.1 Kontext [pro], which powers teams from Adobe to Meta and beyond. Our open core approach drives experimentation, invites scrutiny, lowers costs, and ensures that we can keep sharing open technology from the Black Forest and the Bay into the world.</p><h2><strong>From FLUX.1 to FLUX.2</strong></h2><p>Precision, efficiency, control, extreme realism - where FLUX.1 showed the potential of media models as powerful creative tools, FLUX.2 shows how frontier capability can transform production workflows. By radically changing the economics of generation, FLUX.2 will become an indispensable part of our creative infrastructure.</p><p><img alt="" draggable="false" loading="lazy" width="1578" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://bfl.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2F2gpum2i6%2Fproduction%2F3d8b43142639897e0f0e4a5c073ad7202c2c2fea-1578x800.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://bfl.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2F2gpum2i6%2Fproduction%2F3d8b43142639897e0f0e4a5c073ad7202c2c2fea-1578x800.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://bfl.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2F2gpum2i6%2Fproduction%2F3d8b43142639897e0f0e4a5c073ad7202c2c2fea-1578x800.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p><em><strong>Output Versatility</strong>: FLUX.2 is capable of generating highly detailed, photoreal images along with infographics with complex typography, all at resolutions up to 4MP</em></p><h2><strong>What’s New</strong></h2><ul><li><span><strong>Multi-Reference Support</strong>: Reference up to 10 images simultaneously with the best character / product / style consistency available today.</span></li><li><span><strong>Image Detail &amp; Photorealism</strong>: Greater detail, sharper textures, and more stable lighting suitable for product shots, visualization, and photography-like use cases.</span></li><li><span><strong>Text Rendering</strong>: Complex typography, infographics, memes and UI mockups with legible fine text now work reliably in production.</span></li><li><span><strong>Enhanced Prompt Following</strong>: Improved adherence to complex, structured instructions, including multi-part prompts and compositional constraints.</span></li><li><span><strong>World Knowledge</strong>: Significantly more grounded in real-world knowledge, lighting, and spatial logic, resulting in more coherent scenes with expected behavior.</span></li><li><span><strong>Higher Resolution &amp; Flexible Input/Output Ratios:</strong> Image editing on resolutions up to 4MP.</span></li></ul><p><img alt="" draggable="false" loading="lazy" width="3721" height="2798" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://bfl.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2F2gpum2i6%2Fproduction%2F6844c7ed531e3aa09958eea8a9deae8bdabd0b54-3721x2798.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://bfl.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2F2gpum2i6%2Fproduction%2F6844c7ed531e3aa09958eea8a9deae8bdabd0b54-3721x2798.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p><em>All variants of FLUX.2 offer image editing from text and multiple references in one model.</em></p><h2><strong>Available Now</strong></h2><p>The FLUX.2 family covers a spectrum of model products, from fully managed, production-ready APIs to open-weight checkpoints developers can run themselves.

We’re building an open-source chat that works with any LLM (proprietary + open weight) <i>and</i> gives these LLMs the tools they need to be useful (RAG, web search, MCP, deep research, memory, etc.).</p><p>Demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/2g4BxTZ9ztg" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/2g4BxTZ9ztg</a></p><p>Two years ago, Yuhong and I had the same recurring problem. We were on growing teams and it was ridiculously difficult to find the right information across our docs, Slack, meeting notes, etc. Existing solutions required sending out our company's data, lacked customization, and frankly didn't work well. So, we started Danswer, an open-source enterprise search project built to be self-hosted and easily customized.</p><p>As the project grew, we started seeing an interesting trend—even though we were explicitly a search app, people wanted to use Danswer just to chat with LLMs. We’d hear, “the connectors, indexing, and search are great, but I’m going to start by connecting GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Qwen to provide my team with a secure way to use them”.</p><p>Many users would add RAG, agents, and custom tools later, but much of the usage stayed ‘basic chat’. We thought: “why would people co-opt an enterprise search when other AI chat solutions exist?”</p><p>As we continued talking to users, we realized two key points:</p><p>(1) just giving a company secure access to an LLM with a great UI and simple tools is a huge part of the value add of AI</p><p>(2) providing this <i>well</i> is much harder than you might think and the bar is incredibly high</p><p>Consumer products like ChatGPT and Claude already provide a great experience—and chat with AI for work is something (ideally) everyone at the company uses 10+ times per day. People expect the same snappy, simple, and intuitive UX with a full feature set. Getting hundreds of small details right to take the experience from “this works” to “this feels magical” is not easy, and nothing else in the space has managed to do it.</p><p>So ~3 months ago we pivoted to Onyx, the open-source chat UI with:</p><p>- (truly) world class chat UX. Usable both by a fresh college grad who grew up with AI and an industry veteran who’s using AI tools for the first time.</p><p>- Support for all the common add-ons: RAG, connectors, web search, custom tools, MCP, assistants, deep research.</p><p>- RBAC, SSO, permission syncing, easy on-prem hosting to make it work for larger enterprises.</p><p>Through building features like deep research and code interpreter that work across model providers, we've learned a ton of non-obvious things about engineering LLMs that have been key to making Onyx work. I'd like to share two that were particularly interesting (happy to discuss more in the comments).</p><p>First, context management is one of the most difficult and important things to get right. We’ve found that LLMs really struggle to remember both system prompts and previous user messages in long conversations. Even simple instructions like “ignore sources of type X” in the system prompt are very often ignored. This is exacerbated by multiple tool calls, which can often feed in huge amounts of context. We solved this problem with a “Reminder” prompt—a short 1-3 sentence blurb injected at the end of the user message that describes the non-negotiables that the LLM must abide by. Empirically, LLMs attend most to the very end of the context window, so this placement gives the highest likelihood of adherence.</p><p>Second, we’ve needed to build an understanding of the “natural tendencies” of certain models when using tools, and build around them. For example, the GPT family of models are fine-tuned to use a python code interpreter that operates in a Jupyter notebook. Even if told explicitly, it refuses to add `print()` around the last line, since, in Jupyter, this last line is automatically written to stdout. Other models don’t have this strong preference, so we’ve had to design our model-agnostic code interpreter to also automatically `print()` the last bare line.</p><p>So far, we’ve had a Fortune 100 team fork Onyx and provide 10k+ employees access to every model within a single interface, and create thousands of use-case specific Assistants for every department, each using the best model for the job. We’ve seen teams operating in sensitive industries completely airgap Onyx w/ locally hosted LLMs to provide a copilot that wouldn’t have been possible otherwise.</p><p>If you’d like to try Onyx out, follow <a href="https://docs.onyx.app/deployment/getting_started/quickstart">https://docs.onyx.app/deployment/getting_started/quickstart</a> to get set up locally w/ Docker in &lt;15 minutes. For our Cloud: <a href="https://www.onyx.app/">https://www.onyx.app/</a>. If there’s anything you'd like to see to make it a no-brainer to replace your ChatGPT Enterprise/Claude Enterprise subscription, we’d love to hear it!</p></div></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr></tbody></table><br>

<p>It is rarely newsworthy when a project or package picks up a new
dependency. However, changes in a core tool like Debian's <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/apt-team/apt#apt">Advanced Package
Tool</a> (APT) can have far-reaching effects. For example, Julian
Andres Klode's <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20251031213541.GA73786@debian.org/">declaration</a>
that APT would require Rust in May 2026 means that a few of Debian's
unofficial ports must either acquire a working Rust toolchain or
depend on an old version of APT. This has raised several questions
within the project, particularly about the ability of a single
maintainer to make changes that have widespread impact.</p>

<p>On October 31, Klode sent an announcement to the debian-devel
mailing list that he intended to introduce Rust dependencies and code
into APT as soon as May 2026:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This extends at first to the Rust compiler and standard library, and
the Sequoia ecosystem.</p>

<p>In particular, our code to parse .deb, .ar, .tar, and the HTTP
signature verification code would strongly benefit from memory safe
languages and a stronger approach to unit testing.</p>

<p>If you maintain a port without a working Rust toolchain,
please ensure it has one within the next 6 months, or
sunset the port.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Klode added this was necessary so that the project as a whole could
move forward, rely on modern technologies, "<q>and not be held back by
trying to shoehorn modern software on retro computing
devices</q>". Some Debian developers have welcomed the news. Paul
Tagliamonte <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/CAO6P2QQD8MDUTAo_F=kGfDsBF0Xv+Wv020dm-n-WGnb7ODYW-g@mail.gmail.com">acknowledged</a>
that it would impact unofficial Debian ports but called the push
toward Rust "<q>welcome news</q>".</p>

<p>However, John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/ad6e60711c8ed3372ed7f324d7b1be23b0722a0d.camel@physik.fu-berlin.de/">complained</a>
that Klode's wording was unpleasant and that the approach was
confrontational. In <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/afb7c58fb0fb995ebde3fb72b4cc4d1943a37923.camel@physik.fu-berlin.de/">another
message</a>, he explained that he was not against adoption of Rust; he
had worked on enabling Rust on many of the Debian architectures and
helped to fix architecture-specific bugs in the Rust toolchain as well
as LLVM upstream. However, the message strongly suggested there was no room
for a change in plan: Klode had ended his message with "<q>thank you for
understanding</q>", which invited no further discussion. Glaubitz was
one of a few Debian developers who expressed discomfort with Klode's
communication style in the message.</p>

<p>Klode <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20251031223819.GA97356@debian.org">noted</a>,
briefly, that Rust was already a hard requirement for all Debian
release architectures and ports, except for <a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/alpha/">Alpha (alpha)</a>, <a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/m68k/">Motorola 680x0 (m68k)</a>,
<a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/hppa/">PA-RISC (hppa)</a>, and
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SH4">SuperH (sh4)</a>, because of
APT's use of the <a href="https://sequoia-pgp.org/">Sequoia-PGP</a>
project's <a href="https://packages.debian.org/trixie/sqv"><tt>sqv</tt></a> tool to
verify <a href="https://openpgp.dev/book/signatures.html">OpenPGP</a>
signatures. APT falls back to using the GNU Privacy Guard
signature-verification tool, <a href="https://packages.debian.org/trixie/gpgv"><tt>gpgv</tt></a>, on
ports that do not have a Rust compiler. By depending directly on Rust,
though, APT itself would not be available on ports without a Rust
compiler. LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1045363/">recently
covered</a> the state of Linux architecture support, and the status of
Rust support for each one.</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>None of the ports listed by Klode are among those <a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/#:~:text=List%20of%20official%20ports,-These">officially
supported</a> by Debian today, or targeted for support in
Debian&nbsp;14 ("forky"). The sh4 port has never been officially
supported, and none of the other ports have been supported since
Debian&nbsp;6.0. The actual impact on the ports lacking Rust is also
less dramatic than it sounded at first. Glaubitz <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/708d1a6e63d53242cf89f01c2d791e91f1eccab6.camel@physik.fu-berlin.de/">assured</a>
Antoni Boucher that "<q>the ultimatum that Julian set doesn't really
exist</q>", but phrasing it that way "<q>gets more attention in the
news</q>". Boucher is the maintainer of <a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/rustc_codegen_gcc"><tt>rust_codegen_gcc</tt></a>,
a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/954787/#codegen_gcc">GCC
ahead-of-time code generator for Rust</a>. Nothing, Glaubitz said,
stops ports from using a non-Rust version of APT until Boucher and
others manage to bootstrap Rust for those ports.</p>

<h4>Security theater?</h4>

<p>David Kalnischkies, who is also a <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/apt-team/apt/-/commits/main?author=David%20Kalnischkies">major
contributor</a> to APT, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/sdi72zvp4koyi7h7wo2bwslds2j466ix4sar7wuaks3szphjmp@xg6itydwhqbp/">suggested</a>
that if the goal is to reduce bugs, it would be better to remove the
code that is used to parse the .deb, .ar, and .tar formats that Klode
mentioned from APT entirely. It is only needed for two tools, <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/apt-utils/apt-ftparchive.1.en.html"><tt>apt-ftparchive</tt></a>
and <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/apt-utils/apt-extracttemplates.1.en.html"><tt>apt-extracttemplates</tt></a>,
he said, and the only "<q>serious usage</q>" of
<tt>apt-ftparchive</tt> was by Klode's employer, Canonical, for its <a href="https://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a> software-collaboration
platform. If those were taken out of the main APT code base, then it
would not matter whether they were written in Rust, Python, or another
language, since the tools are not directly necessary for any given
port.</p>

<p>Kalnischkies also questioned the claim that Rust was necessary to
achieve the stronger approach to unit testing that Klode mentioned:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can certainly do unit tests in C++, we do. The main problem is
that someone has to write those tests. Like docs.</p>

<p>Your new solver e.g. has none (apart from our preexisting integration
tests). You don't seriously claim that is because of C++ ?
If you don't like GoogleTest, which is what we currently have,
I could suggest doctest (as I did in previous installments).
Plenty other frameworks exist with similar or different styles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Klode has not responded to those comments yet, which is a bit
unfortunate given the fact that introducing hard dependencies on
Rust has an impact beyond his own work on APT. It may well be that he
has good answers to the questions, but it can also give the
impression that Klode is simply embracing a trend toward Rust. He is <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/migration-to-rust-coreutils-in-25-10/59708">involved</a>
in the Ubuntu <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1014002/">work to migrate from GNU Coreutils to the Rust-based uutils</a>. The reasons given for that work, again, are around
modernization and better security—but security is not automatically 
guaranteed simply by switching to Rust, and there are a number of
other considerations.</p>

<p>For example, Adrian Bunk <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/aQkl0qyIyJ5+y5lC@localhost/">pointed
out</a> that there are a number of Debian teams, as well as tooling,
that will be impacted by writing some of APT in Rust. The release
notes for Debian&nbsp;13 ("trixie") <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.html#go-and-rust-based-packages">mention</a>
that Debian's infrastructure "<q>currently has problems with
rebuilding packages of types that systematically use static
linking</q>", such as those with code written in Go and Rust. Thus, "<q>these packages will be
covered by limited security support until the infrastructure is
improved to deal with them maintainably</q>". Limited security support
means that updates to Rust libraries are likely to only be released
when Debian publishes a point release, which happens about every two
months. The security team has <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1106154#10">specifically
stated</a> that <tt>sqv</tt> is fully supported, but there are still
outstanding problems.</p>

<p>Due to the static-linking issue, any time one of <tt>sqv</tt>'s
dependencies, currently more than 40 Rust crates, have to be rebuilt
due to a security issue, <tt>sqv</tt> (at least potentially) also
needs to be rebuilt. There are also difficulties in tracking CVEs for
all of its dependencies, and understanding when a security
vulnerability in a Rust crate may require updating a Rust program that
depends on it.</p>

<p>Fabian Grünbichler, a maintainer of Debian's Rust toolchain, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/c818f7ef-eff7-40ac-b153-a88412f71d86@app.fastmail.com/">listed</a>
several outstanding problems Debian has with dealing with Rust
packages. One of the largest is the need for a consistent Debian policy for declaring
statically linked libraries. In 2022, Guillem Jover added a control
field for Debian packages called Static-Built-Using (SBU), which would list
the source packages used to build a binary package. This would
indicate when a binary package needs to be rebuilt due to an update in
another source package. For example, <tt>sqv</tt> depends on more than
40 Rust crates that are packaged for Debian. Without declaring the
SBUs, it may not be clear if <tt>sqv</tt> needs to be updated when one
of its dependencies is updated. Debian has been working on a <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1069256">policy
requirement for SBU</a> since April 2024, but it is not yet finished
or adopted.</p>

<p>The discussion sparked by Grünbichler makes clear that most of
Debian's Rust-related problems are in the process of being
solved. However, there's no evidence that Klode explored the problems
before declaring that APT would depend on Rust, or even asked "is this
a reasonable time frame to introduce this dependency?"</p>

<h4>Where tradition meets tomorrow</h4>

<p>Debian's tagline, or at least one of its taglines, is "the
universal operating system", meaning that the project aims to run on a
wide variety of hardware (old and new) and be usable on the desktop,
server, IoT devices, and more. The "<a href="https://www.debian.org/intro/why_debian">Why Debian</a>" page
lists a number of reasons users and developers should choose the
distribution: <a href="https://www.debian.org/ports">multiple hardware
architectures</a>, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS">long-term
support</a>, and its <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution">democratic governance
structure</a> are just a few of the arguments it puts forward in favor
of Debian. It also notes that "<q>Debian cannot be controlled by a
single company</q>". A single developer employed by a company to work
on Debian tools pushing a change that seems beneficial to that
company, without discussion or debate, that impacts multiple hardware
architectures and that requires other volunteers to do unplanned work
or meet an artificial deadline seems to go against many of the
project's stated values.</p>

<p>Debian, of course, does have checks and balances that could be
employed if other Debian developers feel it necessary. Someone could,
for example, appeal to Debian's <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/tech-ctte">Technical Committee</a>,
or sponsor a general resolution to override a developer if they cannot
be persuaded by discussion alone. That happened recently when the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1041316/">committee required systemd
maintainers to provide the <tt>/var/lock</tt> directory</a> "<q>until
a satisfactory migration of impacted software has occurred and Policy
updated accordingly</q>".</p>

<p>However, it also seems fair to point out that Debian can move
slowly, even glacially, at times. APT <a href="https://mvogt.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/apt-1-1-released/">added</a>
support for the <a href="https://repolib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deb822-format.html">DEB822</a>
format for its source information lists in 2015. Despite APT
supporting that format for years, Klode faced resistance in 2021, when
he <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20211103163429.GA3688731@debian.org/">pushed
for Debian to move to the new format</a> ahead of the Debian&nbsp;12
("bookworm") release in 2021, but was unsuccessful. It is now the
default for trixie with the move to <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1017315/">APT&nbsp;3.0</a>, though APT
will continue to support the old format for years to come.</p>

<p>The fact is, regardless of what Klode does with APT, more and more
free software is being written (or rewritten) in Rust. Making it
easier to support that software when it is packaged for Debian is to
everyone's benefit. Perhaps the project needs some developers who will
be aggressive about pushing the project to move more quickly in
improving its support for Rust. However, what is really needed is more
developers lending a hand to do the work that is needed to support
Rust in Debian and elsewhere, such as <a href="https://rust-gcc.github.io/"><tt>gccrs</tt></a>. It does not
seem in keeping with Debian's community focus for a single developer
to simply declare dependencies that other volunteers will have to
scramble to support.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Scientists have identified five major “epochs” of human brain development in one of the most comprehensive studies to date of how neural wiring changes from infancy to old age.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65974-8" data-link-name="in body link">The study</a>, based on the brain scans of nearly 4,000 people aged under one to 90, mapped neural connections and how they evolve during our lives. This revealed five broad phases, split up by four pivotal “turning points” in which brain organisation moves on to a different trajectory, at around the ages of nine, 32, 66 and 83 years.</p><p>“Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterised by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras,” said Prof Duncan Astle, a researcher in neuroinformatics at Cambridge University and senior author of the study.</p><p>“Understanding that the brain’s structural journey is not a question of steady progression, but rather one of a few major turning points, will help us identify when and how its wiring is vulnerable to disruption.”</p><p>The childhood period of development was found to occur between birth until the age of nine, when it transitions to the adolescent phase – an era that lasts up to the age of 32, on average.</p><p>In a person’s early 30s the brain’s neural wiring shifts into adult mode – the longest era, lasting more than three decades. A third turning point around the age of 66 marks the start of an “early ageing” phase of brain architecture. Finally, the “late ageing” brain takes shape at around 83 years old.</p><p>The scientists quantified brain organisation using 12 different measures, including the efficiency of the wiring, how compartmentalised it is and whether the brain relies heavily on central hubs or has a more diffuse connectivity network.</p><p>From infancy through childhood, our brains are defined by “network consolidation”, as the wealth of synapses – the connectors between neurons – in a baby’s brain are whittled down, with the more active ones surviving. During this period, the study found, the efficiency of the brain’s wiring decreases.</p><p>Meanwhile, grey and white matter grow rapidly in volume, so that cortical thickness – the distance between outer grey matter and inner white matter – reaches a peak, and cortical folding, the characteristic ridges on the outer brain, stabilises.</p><p>In the second “epoch” of the brain, the adolescence era, white matter continues to grow in volume, so organisation of the brain’s communications networks is increasingly refined. This era is defined by steadily increasing efficiency of connections across the whole brain, which is related to enhanced cognitive performance. The epochs were defined by the brain remaining on a constant trend of development over a sustained period, rather than staying in a fixed state throughout.</p><p>“We’re definitely not saying that people in their late 20s are going to be acting like teenagers, or even that their brain looks like that of a teenager,” said Alexa Mousley, who led the research. “It’s really the pattern of change.”</p><p>She added that the findings could give insights into risk factors for mental health disorders, which most frequently emerge during the adolescent period.</p><p>At around the age of 32 the strongest overall shift in trajectory is seen. Life events such as parenthood may play a role in some of the changes seen, although the research did not explicitly test this. “We know that women who give birth, their brain changes afterwards,” said Mousley. “It’s reasonable to assume that there could be a relationship between these milestones and what’s happening in the brain.”</p><p>From 32 years, the brain architecture appears to stabilise compared with previous phases, corresponding with a “plateau in intelligence and personality” based on other studies. Brain regions also become more compartmentalised.</p><p>The final two turning points were defined by decreases in brain connectivity, which were believed to be related to ageing and degeneration of white matter in the brain.</p></div></div>]]></description>

A<a href="https://services.global.ntt/en-us/newsroom/80-percent-of-organizations-agree-that-inadequate-or-outdated-technology-is-holding-back-innovation" target="_blank"> 2024 report</a> by services company <a href="https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/" target="_blank">NTT DATA</a> found that 80 percent of organizations concede that “inadequate or outdated technology is holding back organizational progress and innovation efforts.” Furthermore, the report says that virtually all C-level executives believe legacy infrastructure thwarts their ability to respond to the market. Even so, given that the cost of replacing legacy systems is typically many multiples of the cost of supporting them, business executives <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/inside-hidden-world-legacy-it-systems" target="_self">hesitate to replace them</a> until it is no longer operationally feasible or cost-effective.

Next to electrical infrastructure, with which IT is increasingly merging into a mutually codependent relationship, the failure of our computing systems is an existential threat to modern society.</p><p>Frustratingly, the IT community <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7842842" target="_blank">stubbornly fails to learn</a> from prior failures. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/it-project">IT project</a> managers <a href="https://hbr.org/2025/03/the-uniqueness-trap" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">routinely claim</a> that their project is somehow different or unique and, thus, lessons from previous failures are irrelevant. That is the excuse of the arrogant, though usually not the ignorant. In Phoenix’s case, for example, it was the government’s <a href="https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/bagnall-there-were-lessons-that-might-have-prevented-the-phoenix-pay-disaster-no-one-listened" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">second payroll-system replacement attempt</a>, the first effort ending in failure in 1995. Phoenix project managers ignored the well-documented reasons for the first failure because they claimed its lessons were not applicable, which did nothing to keep the managers from repeating them. As it’s been said, we learn more from failure than from success, but repeated failures are damn expensive.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem13" data-id="13" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/it-management-software-failures/particle-13" data-basename="particle-13" data-post-id="2674305315" data-published-at="1763498559" data-use-pagination="False"><p>Not all software development failures are bad; some failures are even desired. When pushing the limits of developing new types of software products, technologies, or practices, as is happening with AI-related efforts, potential failure is an accepted possibility. With failure, experience increases, new insights are gained, fixes are made, constraints are better understood, and technological innovation and progress continue. However, most IT failures today are not related to pushing the innovative frontiers of the computing art, but the edges of the mundane. They do not represent Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter’s “<a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/CreativeDestruction.html" target="_blank">gales of creative destruction</a>.” They’re more like gales of financial destruction. Just how many more <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/278677/enterprise-resource-planning-10-famous-erp-disasters-dustups-and-disappointments.html" target="_blank">enterprise resource planning (ERP) project failures</a> are needed before success becomes routine? Such failures should be called IT blunders, as learning anything new from them is dubious at best.</p><p>Was Phoenix a failure or a blunder? I argue strongly for the latter, but at the very least, Phoenix serves as a master class in IT <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/project-mismanagement">project mismanagement</a>. The question is whether the Canadian government learned from this experience any more than it did from 1995’s payroll-project fiasco? <a href="https://www.thealbertan.com/national-news/fixing-problems-with-phoenix-payroll-system-cost-taxpayers-51-billion-official-10851998" target="_blank">The government maintains it will learn</a>, which might be true, given the Phoenix failure’s high political profile. But will Phoenix’s lessons extend to the <a href="https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_202310_07_e_44340.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thousands of outdated Canadian government IT systems</a> needing replacement or modernization? Hopefully, but hope is not a methodology, and purposeful action will be necessary.</p></div><p>The IT community has striven mightily for decades to make the incomprehensible routine. </p><div id="rebelltitem15" data-id="15" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/it-management-software-failures/particle-15" data-basename="particle-15" data-post-id="2674305315" data-published-at="1763498559" data-use-pagination="False"><p>Repeatedly making the same mistakes and expecting a different result is not learning.

Finding examples of what could be termed “IT heroic failures” is like<a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/encyclopaedia_romana/greece/hetairai/diogenes.html" target="_blank"> Diogenes</a> seeking one honest man.</p><p>The consequences of not learning from blunders will be much greater and more insidious as society grapples with the growing effects of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a>, or more accurately, “intelligent” <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/algorithms">algorithms</a> embedded into software systems.

Both used questionable algorithms to identify deceptive payment claims without human oversight. State officials used MiDAS to accuse tens of thousands of Michiganders of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/unemployment">unemployment</a> fraud, while Centrelink officials falsely accused hundreds of thousands of Australians of being welfare cheats. Untold numbers of lives will never be the same because of what occurred. Government officials in Michigan and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/australia">Australia</a> placed far too much trust in those algorithms. They had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to acknowledge that something was amiss, even after it was clearly demonstrated that the software was untrustworthy. Even then, officials tried to downplay the errors’ impact on people, then fought against paying compensation to those adversely affected by the errors. While such behavior is legally termed “maladministration,” <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057305" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">administrative evil</a> is closer to reality.</p></div><p>So, we are left with only a professional and personal obligation to reemphasize the obvious: Ask what you do know, what you should know, and how big the gap is between them before embarking on creating an IT system. If no one else has ever successfully built your system with the schedule, budget, and functionality you asked for, please explain why your organization thinks it can. Software is inherently fragile; building complex, secure, and resilient software systems is difficult, detailed, and time-consuming. Small errors have outsize effects, each with an almost infinite number of ways they can manifest, from causing a minor functional error to a system outage to allowing a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> threat to penetrate the system. The more complex and interconnected the system, the more opportunities for errors and their exploitation. A nice start would be for senior management who control the purse strings to finally treat software and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/systems-development">systems development</a>, operations, and sustainment efforts with the respect they deserve. This not only means providing the personnel, financial resources, and leadership support and commitment, but also the professional and personal accountability they demand.</p><div id="rebelltitem26" data-id="26" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/it-management-software-failures/particle-26" data-basename="particle-26" data-post-id="2674305315" data-published-at="1763498705" data-use-pagination="False"><p>It is well known that honesty, skepticism, and ethics are essential to achieving project success, yet they are often absent.

It is a common “secret” that it is far easier to get funding to fix a troubled software development effort than to ask for what is required up front to address the risks involved.

							<p>As one of the co-creators of <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, I have been (slowly) writing a long series of posts on the making of everyone’s favorite orange marsupial. You can find them all below, so enjoy.</p>

										<p>In the summer of 1994 Naughty Dog, Inc. was still a two-man company, myself and my longtime partner Jason Rubin. Over the&nbsp;preceding eight years,&nbsp;we had published six&nbsp;games as a lean and mean duo, but&nbsp;the time had come to expand. In…</p>

										<p>So what was it that Sega and Nintendo had in 1994, but Sony didn’t?<br>
An existing competing mascot character. Sega had Sonic and Nintendo had Mario, but Sony product slate was blank.<br>
So we set about creating a mascot on the theory that maybe, just maybe, we might be able to slide into that opening. I’m still surprised it worked.</p>

										<p>While all this art design was going on, I, and then in January 1995, Dave, struggled to build an engine and tool pipeline that would make it possible to render these grandiose cartoon worlds we had envisioned on paper. Since during fall of 1994 Jason was also the only artist, he frantically generated all the source material and banged on my head to make sure it would look incredible.</p>

							<div>
										<p>We were forging new gameplay ground, causing a lot of growing pains. The control of the main character is the single most important thing in a CAG. I did all the programming, but Mark helped whip me along. For example saying, “he doesn’t stop fast enough,” or “he needs to be able to jump for a frame or two AFTER he’s run off a cliff or it will be frustrating.” Criticism is essential, and as a programmer who wrote dozens of world class control schemes in the years between 1994 and 2004, I rewrote every one at least five or six times. Iteration is king.</p>

										<p>But once the core gameplay worked, these cool levels were missing something. We’d spent so many polygons on our detailed backgrounds and “realistic” cartoon characters that the enemies weren’t that dense, so everything felt a bit empty.</p>

										<p>Not only did we need to finish our E3 demo, but we needed a real name for the game — Willie the Wombat wasn’t going to cut it. Now, in the Naughty Dog office proper we knew he was a Bandicoot. In fact, we liked the idea of using an action name for him, like Crash, Dash, Smash, and Bash — fallout from the visceral reaction to smashing so many boxes.</p>

This post is about GOOL, the LISP language used in Crash 1, Crash 2, and Crash 3. GOOL was my second custom language. GOOL was mostly interpreted, although by Crash 2 basic expressions were compiled into machine code.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://nmil.dev/what-you-can-get-for-the-price-of-a-netflix-subscription">https://nmil.dev/what-you-can-get-for-the-price-of-a-netflix-subscription</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46042969">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A couple of weeks ago, I decided to do away with my Netflix subscription. I simply was barely using it, and whenever I did it was more out of habit than it really being the thing I wanted to do with my time. Sure, there's still some decent stuff on there, but the vast majority of it feels absolutely moneyballed. Good, but somehow <em>too good</em>, and with no character.</p>

<p>As much as I'd love to elaborate on why I think Netflix is evil, that's not todays topic. What I wanted to share is how for approximately the price I was paying for my subscription (€19.99), I've snapped up three subscriptions that I'm using on a daily basis. They're all pretty much interchangeable with other alternatives. The main thing I want to highlight is the individual slot they each fill out for me.</p>

<h2 id="1-a-subscription-to-zed-pro-10">1. A subscription to Zed Pro (~€10)</h2>

<p>Frankly, I haven't really put too much thought into whether the unit economics are the best here. The main point is, these are €10 that make my coding experience more pleasant, and get me writing more code in my spare time. In that sense it's money well spent.</p>

<p>Does it matter if you get a Cursor subscription, or a Zed one, or whatever else is in vogue when you're reading? No, just get the thing that will get you excited to get your hands on the keyboard!
To me, Zed feels more intentionally built than the VSClones: things flow nicely, it feels snappy, the ui is less cluttered... It's just <em>nice</em>.</p>

<p>Editor preferences aside, the main takeaway is, invest in a hobby you actively engage in. Make that little bit more appealing and you have one more reason to be spending your time doing the thing that makes you feel good, rather than letting a couple hours a day evaporate watching another forgettable show.</p>

<h2 id="2-a-kagi-subscription-5-month">2. A Kagi subscription (~€5/month)</h2>

<p>I think we can mostly agree google kind of sucks nowadays. Whenever I search, I automatically scroll down to skip the sponsored posts and SEO maxxed websites, and still don't fully trust what I get. Maybe that's why we all started appending “reddit” the end of our searches.</p>

<p>Are the search results themselves better with Kagi? To be honest, I can't tell yet, others have written far more informed takes on the topic. What does it for me is the simple fact of being able to pay directly for a service that I use, and value, rather than having to trade my attention in and endure a wall of ads. Especially if it's something I use over and over, every day. That's what I mean to highlight here: we can support products that we enjoy by paying for them (who would have thought?) rather than letting them lobotomize us via ad feeds.</p>

<h2 id="3-a-cheap-server-on-hetzner-4-month">3. A cheap server on Hetzner (~€4/month)</h2>

<p>Again, the choice of provider here is secondary. The point is, I finally have my little stake on the internet. It's relatively barebones, and I like that. It forces me to learn and engage. In fact, that is where my blog is hosted!</p>

<p>So to sum it up: We don't <em>have</em> to default to a streaming subscription because that's become the standard human-being thing to do. For the same money you can build a suite of useful, well crafted tools that help you:
– Get the most out of your hobbies
– Spend less time looking at ads
– Build things you can share with the world</p>

<p>P.S. Not one word here was written by AI. I plan on keeping it that way for anything that goes on this blog. So, if anything reads like slop, it's <em>my</em> slop :)</p>

<p>I’ve written before about building <a href="https://austinsnerdythings.com/2021/04/19/microsecond-accurate-ntp-with-a-raspberry-pi-and-pps-gps/">microsecond-accurate NTP servers with Raspberry Pi and GPS PPS</a>, and more recently about <a href="https://austinsnerdythings.com/2025/02/14/revisiting-microsecond-accurate-ntp-for-raspberry-pi-with-gps-pps-in-2025/">revisiting the setup in 2025</a>. Both posts focused on the hardware setup and basic configuration to achieve sub-microsecond time synchronization using GPS Pulse Per Second (PPS) signals.</p>



<p>But there was a problem. Despite having a stable PPS reference, my NTP server’s frequency drift was exhibiting significant variation over time. After months (years) of monitoring the system with Grafana dashboards, I noticed something interesting: the frequency oscillations seemed to correlate with CPU temperature changes. The frequency would drift as the CPU heated up during the day and cooled down at night, even though the PPS reference remained rock-solid.</p>



<p>Like clockwork (no pun intended), I somehow get sucked back into trying to improve my setup every 6-8 weeks. This post is the latest on that never-ending quest.</p>



<p>This post details how I achieved an <strong>81% reduction in frequency variability</strong> and <strong>77% reduction in frequency standard deviation</strong> through a combination of CPU core pinning and thermal stabilization. Welcome to Austin’s Nerdy Things, where we solve problems that 99.999% of people (and 99% of datacenters) don’t have.</p>



<h2>The Problem: Thermal-Induced Timing Jitter</h2>



<p>Modern CPUs, including those in Raspberry Pis, use dynamic frequency scaling to save power and manage heat. When the CPU is idle, it runs at a lower frequency (and voltage). When load increases, it scales up. This is great for power efficiency, but terrible for precision timekeeping.</p>



<p>Why? Because timekeeping (with NTP/chronyd/others) relies on a stable system clock to discipline itself against reference sources. If the CPU frequency is constantly changing, the system clock’s tick rate varies, introducing jitter into the timing measurements. Even though my PPS signal was providing a mostly perfect 1-pulse-per-second reference, the CPU’s frequency bouncing around made it harder for chronyd to maintain a stable lock.</p>



<p>But here’s the key insight: <strong>the system clock is ultimately derived from a crystal oscillator</strong>, and crystal oscillator frequency is temperature-dependent. The oscillator sits on the board near the CPU, and as the CPU heats up and cools down throughout the day, so does the crystal. Even a few degrees of temperature change can shift the oscillator’s frequency by parts per million – exactly what I was seeing in my frequency drift graphs. The CPU frequency scaling was one factor, but the underlying problem was that temperature changes were affecting the crystal oscillator itself. By stabilizing the CPU temperature, I could stabilize the thermal environment for the crystal oscillator, keeping its frequency consistent.</p>



<p>Looking at my Grafana dashboard, I could see the frequency offset wandering over a range of about 1 PPM (parts per million) as the Pi warmed up and cooled down throughout the day. The RMS offset was averaging around 86 nanoseconds, which isn’t terrible (it’s actually really, really, really good), but I knew it could be better.</p>



<h2>The Discovery</h2>



<p>After staring at graphs for longer than I’d like to admit, I had an idea: what if I could keep the CPU at a constant temperature? If the temperature (and therefore the frequency) stayed stable, maybe the timing would stabilize too.</p>



<p>The solution came in two parts:</p>



<p>1. <strong>CPU core isolation</strong> – Dedicate CPU 0 exclusively to timing-critical tasks (chronyd and PPS interrupts) 2. <strong>Thermal stabilization</strong> – Keep the other CPUs busy to maintain a constant temperature, preventing frequency scaling</p>



<p>Here’s what happened when I turned on the thermal stabilization system on November 17, 2025 at 09:10 AM:</p>

<p>That vertical red line marks when I activated the “time burner” process. Notice how the frequency oscillations immediately dampen and settle into a much tighter band? Let’s dive into how this works.</p>



<h2>The Solution Part 1: CPU Core Pinning and Real-Time Priority</h2>



<p>The first step is isolating timing-critical operations onto a dedicated CPU core. On a Raspberry Pi (4-core ARM), this means:</p>



<ul>
<li>CPU 0: Reserved for chronyd and PPS interrupts</li>



<li>CPUs 1-3: Everything else, including our thermal load</li>
</ul>



<p>I had AI (probably Claude Sonnet 4 ish, maybe 4.5) create a boot optimization script that runs at system startup:</p>



<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# PPS NTP Server Performance Optimization Script
# Sets CPU affinity, priorities, and performance governor at boot

set -e

echo "Setting up PPS NTP server performance optimizations..."

# Wait for system to be ready
sleep 5

# Set CPU governor to performance mode
echo "Setting CPU governor to performance..."
cpupower frequency-set -g performance

# Pin PPS interrupt to CPU0 (may fail if already pinned, that's OK)
echo "Configuring PPS interrupt affinity..."
echo 1 &gt; /proc/irq/200/smp_affinity 2&gt;/dev/null || echo "PPS IRQ already configured"

# Wait for chronyd to start
echo "Waiting for chronyd to start..."
timeout=30
while [ $timeout -gt 0 ]; do
    chronyd_pid=$(pgrep chronyd 2&gt;/dev/null || echo "")
    if [ -n "$chronyd_pid" ]; then
        echo "Found chronyd PID: $chronyd_pid"
        break
    fi
    sleep 1
    ((timeout--))
done

if [ -z "$chronyd_pid" ]; then
    echo "Warning: chronyd not found after 30 seconds"
else
    # Set chronyd to real-time priority and pin to CPU 0
    echo "Setting chronyd to real-time priority and pinning to CPU 0..."
    chrt -f -p 50 $chronyd_pid
    taskset -cp 0 $chronyd_pid
fi

# Boost ksoftirqd/0 priority
echo "Boosting ksoftirqd/0 priority..."
ksoftirqd_pid=$(ps aux | grep '\[ksoftirqd/0\]' | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}')
if [ -n "$ksoftirqd_pid" ]; then
    renice -n -10 $ksoftirqd_pid
    echo "ksoftirqd/0 priority boosted (PID: $ksoftirqd_pid)"
else
    echo "Warning: ksoftirqd/0 not found"
fi

echo "PPS NTP optimization complete!"

# Log current status
echo "=== Current Status ==="
echo "CPU Governor: $(cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor)"
echo "PPS IRQ Affinity: $(cat /proc/irq/200/effective_affinity_list 2&gt;/dev/null || echo 'not readable')"
if [ -n "$chronyd_pid" ]; then
    echo "chronyd Priority: $(chrt -p $chronyd_pid)"
fi
echo "======================"</code></pre>



<p><strong>What this does:</strong></p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Performance Governor</strong>: Forces all CPUs to run at maximum frequency, disabling frequency scaling</li>



<li><strong>PPS IRQ Pinning</strong>: Ensures PPS interrupt (IRQ 200) is handled exclusively by CPU 0</li>



<li><strong>Chronyd Real-Time Priority</strong>: Sets chronyd to SCHED_FIFO priority 50, giving it preferential CPU scheduling</li>



<li>C<strong>hronyd CPU Affinity</strong>: Pins chronyd to CPU 0 using <code>taskset</code></li>



<li><strong>ksoftirqd Priority Boost</strong>: Improves priority of the kernel softirq handler on CPU 0</li>
</ol>



<p>This script can be added to <code>/etc/rc.local</code> or as a systemd service to run at boot.</p>



<h2>The Solution Part 2: PID-Controlled Thermal Stabilization</h2>



<p>Setting the performance governor helps, but on a Raspberry Pi, even at max frequency, the CPU temperature will still vary based on ambient conditions and load. Temperature changes affect the CPU’s actual operating frequency due to thermal characteristics of the silicon.</p>



<p>The solution? Keep the CPU at a constant temperature using a PID-controlled thermal load. I call it the “time burner” (inspired by CPU burn-in tools, but with precise temperature control).</p>



<p>As a reminder of what we’re really doing here: <strong>we’re maintaining a stable thermal environment for the crystal oscillator</strong>. The RPi 3B’s 19.2 MHz oscillator is physically located near the CPU on the Raspberry Pi board, so by actively controlling CPU temperature, we’re indirectly controlling the oscillator’s temperature. Since the oscillator’s frequency is temperature-dependent (this is basic physics of quartz crystals), keeping it at a constant temperature means keeping its frequency stable – which is exactly what we need for precise timekeeping.</p>



<p>Here’s how it works:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Read CPU temperature</strong> from <code>/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp</code> </li>



<li><strong>PID controller</strong> calculates how much CPU time to burn to maintain target temperature (I chose 54°C) </li>



<li><strong>Three worker processes</strong> run on CPUs 1, 2, and 3 (avoiding CPU 0) </li>



<li><strong>Each worker</strong> alternates between busy-loop (MD5 hashing) and sleeping based on PID output </li>



<li><strong>Temperature stabilizes</strong> at the setpoint, preventing thermal drift</li>
</ol>



<p>Here’s the core implementation (simplified for readability):</p>

<p>The full implementation includes a temperature filtering system to smooth out sensor noise and command-line arguments for tuning the PID parameters.</p>



<p><strong>PID Tuning Notes:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Kp=0.05</strong>: Proportional gain – responds to current error</li>



<li><strong>Ki=0.02</strong>: Integral gain – eliminates steady-state error</li>



<li><strong>Kd=0.0</strong>: Derivative gain – set to zero because temperature changes slowly</li>
</ul>



<p>The target temperature of 54°C was chosen empirically – high enough to keep the CPU from idling down, but low enough to avoid thermal throttling (which starts around 80°C on Raspberry Pi).</p>



<h2>The Results: Numbers Don’t Lie</h2>



<p>The improvement was immediately visible. Here are the statistics comparing performance before and after the optimization:</p>



<p><strong>A note on ambient conditions:</strong> The Raspberry Pi lives in a project enclosure in our master bedroom (chosen for its decent GPS reception and ADS-B coverage for a new <a href="https://skyspottr.com/map/">aircraft AR overlay app idea I’m working on</a> also running on this Pi). While the time burner maintains the CPU die temperature at 54°C, the enclosure is still subject to ambient temperature swings. Room temperature cycles from a low of 66°F (18.9°C) at 5:15 AM to a peak of 72°F (22.2°C) at 11:30 AM – a 6°F daily swing from our heating schedule. The fact that we see such dramatic frequency stability improvements <em>despite</em> this ambient variation speaks to how effective the thermal control is. The CPU’s active heating overwhelms the environmental changes, maintaining consistent silicon temperature where it matters most.</p>



<h3>Frequency Stability</h3>

<p>The RMS offset is chronyd’s estimate of the timing uncertainty. Cutting this nearly in half means the system is maintaining significantly better time accuracy.</p>



<h2>Setup Instructions</h2>



<p>Want to replicate this? Here’s the step-by-step process:</p>



<h3>Prerequisites</h3>



<p>You need a working GPS PPS NTP server setup. If you don’t have one yet, follow my <a href="https://austinsnerdythings.com/2025/02/14/revisiting-microsecond-accurate-ntp-for-raspberry-pi-with-gps-pps-in-2025/">2025 NTP guide</a> first.</p>



<h3>Step 0: Install Required Tools</h3>



<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install linux-cpupower python3 util-linux</code></pre>



<h3>Step 1: Create the Boot Optimization Script</h3>



<p>Save the optimization script from earlier as <code>/usr/local/bin/pps-optimize.sh</code>:</p>



<pre><code>sudo nano /usr/local/bin/pps-optimize.sh
# Paste the script content
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pps-optimize.sh</code></pre>



<h3>Step 2: Create Systemd Service for Boot Script</h3>



<p>Create <code>/etc/systemd/system/pps-optimize.service</code>:</p>



<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=PPS NTP Performance Optimization
After=chronyd.service
Requires=chronyd.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/pps-optimize.sh
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</code></pre>



<p>Enable it:</p>



<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable pps-optimize.service</code></pre>



<h3>Step 3: Install the Time Burner Script</h3>



<p>Save the time burner Python script as <code>/usr/local/bin/time_burner.py</code>:</p>



<pre><code>sudo nano /usr/local/bin/time_burner.py
# Paste the full time burner script
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/time_burner.py</code></pre>



<h3>Step 4: Create Systemd Service for Time Burner</h3>



<p>Create <code>/etc/systemd/system/time-burner.service</code>:</p>



<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=CPU Thermal Stabilization for NTP
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/time_burner.py -t 54.0 -n 3
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</code></pre>



<p>Enable and start it:</p>



<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable time-burner.service
sudo systemctl start time-burner.service</code></pre>



<h3>Step 5: Verify the Setup</h3>



<p>Check that everything is running:</p>



<pre><code># Verify CPU governor
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
# Should output: performance

# Check chronyd CPU affinity and priority
ps -eo pid,comm,psr,ni,rtprio | grep chronyd
# Should show psr=0 (CPU 0) and rtprio=50

# Check time burner processes
ps aux | grep time_burner
# Should show 4 processes (1 main + 3 workers)

# Monitor NTP performance
chronyc tracking</code></pre>



<p>Example output from <code>chronyc tracking</code>:</p>



<pre><code>Reference ID    : 50505300 (PPS)
Stratum         : 1
Ref time (UTC)  : Sun Nov 24 16:45:23 2025
System time     : 0.000000038 seconds fast of NTP time
Last offset     : -0.000000012 seconds
RMS offset      : 0.000000035 seconds
Frequency       : 1.685 ppm slow
Residual freq   : -0.001 ppm
Skew            : 0.002 ppm
Root delay      : 0.000000001 seconds
Root dispersion : 0.000010521 seconds
Update interval : 16.0 seconds
Leap status     : Normal</code></pre>



<p>Notice the RMS offset of 35 nanoseconds – this is the kind of accuracy you can achieve with thermal stabilization.</p>



<h3>Step 6: Monitor Over Time</h3>



<p>(Topic for a future post)</p>



<p>Set up Grafana dashboards to monitor:</p>



<ul>
<li>Frequency offset (PPM)</li>



<li>RMS offset (nanoseconds)</li>



<li>CPU temperature</li>



<li>System time offset</li>
</ul>



<p>You’ll see the frequency stabilize within a few hours as the PID controller locks onto the target temperature.</p>



<h2>Monitoring and Troubleshooting</h2>



<h3>Real-Time Monitoring</h3>



<p>Watch chronyd tracking in real-time:</p>



<pre><code>watch -n 1 "chronyc tracking"</code></pre>



<p>Check time burner status:</p>



<pre><code>sudo systemctl status time-burner.service</code></pre>



<p>View time burner output:</p>



<pre><code>sudo journalctl -u time-burner.service -f</code></pre>



<h3>Common Issues</h3>



<p><strong>Temperature overshoots or oscillates:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Adjust PID gains – reduce Kp if oscillating, increase Ki if steady-state error</li>



<li>Try different target temperatures (50-60°C range)</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>High CPU usage (obviously):</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>This is intentional – the time burner uses ~90% of 3 cores</li>



<li>Not suitable for Pis running other workloads</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Chronyd not pinned to CPU 0:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Check that the optimization script runs after chronyd starts</li>



<li>Adjust the timing in the systemd service dependencies</li>
</ul>



<h2>Trade-offs and Considerations</h2>



<p>Let’s be honest about the downsides:</p>



<h3>Power Consumption</h3>



<p>The time burner keeps 3 cores at ~30% average utilization. My Pi now draws about 3-4W continuously (vs 1-2W idle). Over a year, that’s an extra 15-25 kWh, or about $2-3 in electricity (depending on your rates).</p>



<h3>Heat</h3>



<p>Running at 54°C means the Pi is warm to the touch. This is well within safe operating temperature (thermal throttling doesn’t start until 80°C), but you might want to ensure adequate ventilation. I added a small heatsink just to be safe.</p>



<h3>CPU Resources</h3>



<p>You’re dedicating 3 of 4 cores to burning cycles. This is fine for a dedicated NTP server, but not suitable if you’re running other services on the same Pi. That said, I am also running the feeder to my new <a href="https://skyspottr.com/map/">ADS-B aircraft visualization app</a> on it. My readsb instance regularly gets to 1200 msg/s with 200+ aircraft.</p>



<h3>Is It Worth It?</h3>



<p>For 99.999% of use cases: <strong>absolutely not</strong>.</p>



<p>Most applications don’t need better than millisecond accuracy, let alone the 35-nanosecond RMS offset I’m achieving. Even for distributed systems, microsecond-level accuracy is typically overkill.</p>



<p><strong>When this might make sense:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Precision timing applications</strong> (scientific instrumentation, radio astronomy)</li>



<li><strong>Distributed systems research</strong> requiring tight clock synchronization</li>



<li><strong>Network testing</strong> where timing precision affects results</li>



<li><strong>Because you can</strong> (the best reason for any homelab project)</li>
</ul>



<p>For me, this falls squarely in the “because you can” category. I had the monitoring infrastructure in place, noticed the thermal correlation, and couldn’t resist solving the problem. Plus, I learned a lot about PID control, CPU thermal characteristics, and Linux real-time scheduling.</p>



<h2>Future Improvements</h2>



<p>Some ideas I’m considering:</p>



<h3>Adaptive PID Tuning</h3>



<p>The current PID gains are hand-tuned for a specific ambient temperature range. The fairly low P value is to avoid spikes when some load on the Pi kicks up the temp. The I is a balance to keep long term “burn” relatively consistent. Implementing an auto-tuning algorithm (like Ziegler-Nichols) or adaptive PID could handle seasonal temperature variations better.</p>



<h3>Hardware Thermal Control</h3>



<p>Instead of software thermal control, I could add an actively cooled heatsink with PWM fan control. This might achieve similar temperature stability while using less power overall.</p>



<h3>Oven-Controlled Crystal Oscillator (OCXO)</h3>



<p>For the ultimate in frequency stability, replacing the Pi’s crystal with a temperature-controlled OCXO would eliminate thermal drift at the source. This is how professional timing equipment works. I do have a BH3SAP GPSDO sitting next to me (subject to a future post)… Then again, I’m the person who just wrote 4000 words about optimizing a $50 time server, so who am I kidding?</p>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>Through a combination of CPU core isolation and PID-controlled thermal stabilization, I achieved:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>81% reduction</strong> in frequency variability</li>



<li><strong>77% reduction</strong> in frequency standard deviation</li>



<li><strong>74% reduction</strong> in frequency range</li>



<li><strong>49% reduction</strong> in RMS offset</li>
</ul>



<p>The system now maintains 38-nanosecond median RMS offset from the GPS PPS reference, with frequency drift that’s barely detectable in the noise. The CPU runs at a constant 54°C, and in steady state, the frequency offset stays within a tight ±0.14 PPM band (compared to ±0.52 PPM before optimization).</p>



<p>Was this necessary? No. Did I learn a bunch about thermal management, PID control, and Linux real-time scheduling? Yes. Would I do it again? Absolutely.</p>



<h3>Resource</h3>



<p>I did come across a “burn” script that was the basis for this thermal management. I can’t find it at the moment, but when I do I’ll link it here.</p>

<ul>
<li>New findings suggest the brain has preconfigured, structured activity patterns even before sensory experiences occur.</li>



<li>UC Santa Cruz researchers used brain organoids to study the brain’s earliest electrical activity.</li>



<li>Understanding early brain patterns could have important implications for diagnosing and treating developmental brain disorders.</li>
</ul>
</div>



<p>Humans have long wondered when and how we begin to form thoughts. Are we born with a pre-configured brain, or do thought patterns only begin to emerge in response to our sensory experiences of the world around us? Now, science is getting closer to answering the questions philosophers have pondered for centuries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, are using tiny models of human brain tissue, called organoids, to study the earliest moments of electrical activity in the brain. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02111-0">A new study</a> in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em> finds that the earliest firings of the brain occur in structured patterns without any external experiences, suggesting that the human brain is preconfigured with instructions about how to navigate and interact with the world.</p>



<p>“These cells are clearly interacting with each other and forming circuits that self-assemble before we can experience anything from the outside world,” said Tal Sharf, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the Baskin School of Engineering and the study’s senior author. “There’s an operating system that exists, that emerges in a primordial state. In my laboratory, we grow brain organoids to peer into this primordial version of the brain’s operating system and study how the brain builds itself before it’s shaped by sensory experience.”</p>



<p>In improving our fundamental understanding of human brain development, these findings can help researchers better understand neurodevelopmental disorders, and pinpoint the impact of toxins like pesticides and microplastics in the developing brain.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="h-studying-the-developing-brain"><strong>Studying the developing brain</strong></h4>



<p>The brain, similar to a computer, runs on electrical signals—the firing of neurons. When these signals begin to fire, and how the human brain develops, are challenging topics for scientists to study, as the early developing human brain is protected within the womb.</p>



<p>Organoids, which are 3D models of tissue grown from human stem cells in the lab, provide a unique window into brain development. The <a href="https://braingeneers.ucsc.edu/">Braingeneers group</a> at UC Santa Cruz, in collaboration with researchers at UC San Francisco and UC Santa Barbara, are pioneering methods to grow these models and take measurements from them to gain insights into brain development and disorders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organoids are particularly useful for understanding if the brain develops in response to sensory input—as they exist in the lab setting and not the body—and can be grown ethically in large quantities. In this study, researchers prompted stem cells to form brain tissue, and then measured their electrical activity using specialized microchips, similar to those that run a computer. Sharf’s background in both applied physics, computation, and neurobiology form his expertise in modelling the circuitry of the early brain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“An organoid system that’s intrinsically decoupled from any sensory input or communication with organs gives you a window into what’s happening with this self-assembly process,” Sharf said. “That self-assembly process is really hard to do with traditional 2D cell culture—you can’t get the cell diversity and the architecture. The cells need to be in intimate contact with each other. We’re trying to control the initial conditions, so we can let biology do its wonderful thing.”</p>







<p>The Sharf lab is developing novel neural interfaces, leveraging expertise in physics, materials science, and electrical engineering. On the right, Koushik Devarajan, an electrical and computer engineering Ph.D. student in the Sharf lab.<br></p>



<h4 id="h-pattern-production"><strong>Pattern production</strong></h4>



<p>The researchers observed the electrical activity of the brain tissue as they self-assembled from stem cells into a tissue that can translate the senses and produce language and conscious thought. They found that within the first few months of development, long before the human brain is capable of receiving and processing complex external sensory information such as vision and hearing, its cells spontaneously began to emit electrical signals characteristic of the patterns that underlie translation of the senses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through decades of neuroscience research, the community has discovered that neurons fire in patterns that aren’t just random. Instead, the brain has a “default mode” — a basic underlying structure for firing neurons which then becomes more specific as the brain processes unique signals like a smell or taste. This background mode outlines the possible range of sensory responses the body and brain can produce.</p>



<p>In their observations of single neuron spikes in the self-assembling organoid models, Sharf and colleagues found that these earliest observable patterns have striking similarity with the brain’s default mode. Even without having received any sensory input, they are firing off a complex repertoire of time-based patterns, or sequences, which have the potential to be refined for specific senses, hinting at a genetically encoded blueprint inherent to the neural architecture of the living brain.</p>



<p>“These intrinsically self-organized systems could serve as a basis for constructing a representation of the world around us,” Sharf said. “The fact that we can see them in these early stages suggests that evolution has figured out a way that the central nervous system can construct a map that would allow us to navigate and interact with the world.”</p>



<p>Knowing that these organoids produce the basic structure of the living brain opens up a range of possibilities for better understanding human neurodevelopment, disease, and the effects of toxins in the brain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re showing that there is a basis for capturing complex dynamics that likely could be signatures of pathological onsets that we could study in human tissue,” Sharf said. “That would allow us to develop therapies, working with clinicians at the preclinical level to potentially develop compounds, drug therapies, and gene editing tools that could be cheaper, more efficient, higher throughput.”</p>



<p>This study included researchers at UC Santa Barbara, Washington University in St. Louis, Johns Hopkins University, the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, and ETH Zurich.</p>
