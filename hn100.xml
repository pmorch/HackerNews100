<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As I get older, I increasingly think about
whether I’m spending my time the right way
to advance my career and my life.
This is also a question that your company
asks about you every performance cycle:
is this engineering manager spending their
time effectively to advance the company or their organization?</p><p>Confusingly, in my experience, answering these nominally similar questions
has surprisingly little in common.
This piece spends some time exploring both questions in the particularly
odd moment we live in today, where managers are being told they’ve
spent the last decade doing the wrong things, and need to engage
with a new model of engineering management in order to be
valued by the latest iteration of the industry.</p><div><p>If you’d be more interested in a video version of this,
here is the recording of a practice run I gave for a talk
centered on these same ideas
(<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17lTreuVdYMNOr7k2XLzrshEJnB-StaNUzAyh9tE0b5w/edit?slide=id.g39f551c2725_0_0#slide=id.g39f551c2725_0_0">slides from talk</a>).</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IJlrX4Z4QWs?si=m9HgL7y0AvdOSUq6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><h2 id="good-leadership-is-a-fad">Good leadership is a fad</h2><p>When I started my software career at Yahoo in the late 2000s, I had two 1:1s with my manager over the course of two
years. The first one came a few months after I started, and he mostly asked me about a colleague’s work quality.
The second came when I gave notice that I was leaving to <a href="https://lethain.com/digg-v4/">join Digg</a>.
A modern evaluation of this manager would be scathing, but his management style closely resembled that of the
team leader in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soul-New-Machine-Tracy-Kidder/dp/0316491977"><em>The Soul of A New Machine</em></a>:
identifying an important opportunity for the team, and navigating the broader organization that might impede progress
towards that goal.
He was, in the context we were working in, an effective manager.</p><p>Compare that leadership style to the expectations of the 2010s, where attracting, retaining, and motivating engineers
was emphasized as the most important leadership criteria in many organizations.
This made sense in <a href="https://lethain.com/productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth/">the era of hypergrowth</a>, where budgets were uncapped
and many companies viewed hiring strong engineers as their constraint on growth.
This was an era where managers were explicitly told to stop writing software as the first step of their transition into management,
and it was good advice! Looking back we can argue it was bad guidance by today’s standards, but it aligned the managers with the leadership expectations
of the moment.</p><p>Then think about our current era, that started in late 2022, where higher interest rates killed <a href="https://www.readmargins.com/p/zirp-explains-the-world">zero-interest-rate-policy (ZIRP)</a>
and productized large language models are positioned as killing deep Engineering organizations.
We’ve flattened Engineering organizations where many roles that previously focused on coordination
are now expected to be hands-on keyboard, working deep in the details.
Once again, the best managers of the prior era–who did exactly what the industry asked them to do–are now reframed as bureaucrats
rather than integral leaders.</p><p>In each of these transitions, the business environment shifted, leading to a new formulation of ideal leadership.
That makes a lot of sense: of course we want leaders to fit the necessary patterns of today.
Where things get weird is that in each case a morality tale was subsequently superimposed on top of the transition:</p><ul><li>In the 2010s, the morality tale was that it was all about empowering engineers as a fundamental good.
Sure, I can get excited for that, but I don’t really believe that narrative: it happened because hiring was competitive.</li><li>In the 2020s, the morality tale is that bureaucratic middle management have made organizations stale and inefficient.
The lack of experts has crippled organizational efficiency.
Once again, I can get behind that–there’s truth here–but the much larger drivers aren’t about morality,
it’s about ZIRP-ending and optimism about productivity gains from AI tooling.</li></ul><p>The conclusion here is clear: the industry will want different things from you as it evolves,
and it will tell you that each of those shifts is because of some complex moral change,
but it’s pretty much always about business realities changing.
If you take any current morality tale as true, then you’re setting yourself up
to be severely out of position when the industry shifts again in a few years,
because “good leadership” is just a fad.</p><h2 id="self-development-across-leadership-fads">Self-development across leadership fads</h2><p>If you accept the argument that the specifically desired leadership skills of today
are the result of fads that frequently shift, then it leads to an important followup question:
what are the right skills to develop in to be effective today and to be impactful across fads?</p><p>Having been and worked with engineering managers for some time, I think there are
<a href="https://lethain.com/categories-engineering-leadership/">eight foundational engineering management skills</a>,
which I want to personally group into two clusters: core skills that are essential to operate in all roles
(including entry-level management roles), and growth skills whose presence–or absence–determines
how far you can go in your career.</p><p>The core skills are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Execution</strong>: lead team to deliver expected tangible and intangible work.
Fundamentally, management is about getting things done, and you’ll neither
get an opportunity to begin managing, nor stay long as a manager, if your
teams don’t execute.</p><p><em>Examples</em>: ship projects, manage on-call rotation, sprint planning, manage incidents</p></li><li><p><strong>Team</strong>: shape the team and the environment such that they succeed.
This is <em>not</em> working for the team, nor is it working for your leadership, it is
finding the balance between the two that works for both.</p><p><em>Examples</em>: hiring, coaching, performance management, advocate with your management</p></li><li><p><strong>Ownership</strong>: navigate reality to make consistent progress, even when reality is difficult
Finding a way to get things done, rather than finding a way that it not getting done is someone else’s fault.</p><p><em>Examples</em>: doing hard things, showing up when it’s uncomfortable, being accountable despite systemic issues</p></li><li><p><strong>Alignment</strong>: build shared understanding across leadership, stakeholders, your team, and the problem space.
Finding a realistic plan that meets the moment, without surprising or being surprised by those around you.</p><p><em>Examples</em>: document and share top problems, and updates during crises</p></li></ol><p>The growth skills are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Taste</strong>: exercise discerning judgment about what “good” looks like—technically, in business terms, and in process/strategy.
Taste is a broadchurch, and my experience is that broad taste is an somewhat universal criteria for truly senior roles.
In some ways, taste is a prerequisite to Amazon’s <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles">Are Right, A Lot</a>.</p><p><em>Examples</em>: refine proposed product concept,
avoid high-risk rewrite,
find usability issues in team’s work</p></li><li><p><strong>Clarity</strong>: your team, stakeholders, and leadership know what you’re doing and why, and agree that it makes sense.
In particular, they understand how you are overcoming your biggest problems. So clarity is not, “Struggling with scalability issues”
but instead “Sharding the user logins database in a new cluster to reduce load.”</p><p><em>Examples</em>: identify levers to progress,
create plan to exit a crisis,
show progress on implementing that plan</p></li><li><p><strong>Navigating ambiguity</strong>: work from complex problem to opinionated, viable approach.
If you’re given an extremely messy, open-ended problem, can you still find a way to make progress?
(I’ve <a href="https://lethain.com/navigating-ambiguity/">written previously about this topic</a>.)</p><p><em>Examples</em>: launching a new business line,
improving developer experience,
going from 1 to N cloud regions</p></li><li><p><strong>Working across timescales</strong>: ensure your areas of responsibility make progress across both the short and long term.
There are many ways to appear successful by cutting corners today, that end in disaster tomorrow.
Success requires understanding, and being accountable for, how different timescales interact.</p><p><em>Examples</em>: have an explicit destination,
ensure short-term work steers towards it,
be long-term rigid and short-term flexible</p></li></ol><p>Having spent a fair amount of time pressure testing these, I’m pretty sure most effective managers, and manager archetypes, can be fit into these boxes.</p><h3 id="self-assessing-on-these-skills">Self-assessing on these skills</h3><p>There’s no perfect way to measure anything complex, but here are some thinking
questions for you to spend time with as you assess where you stand on each of these skills:</p><ol><li><strong>Execution</strong><ul><li>When did your team last have friction delivering work? Is that a recurring issue?</li><li>What’s something hard you shipped that went really, really well?</li><li>When were you last pulled onto solving a time-sensitive, executive-visible project?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Team</strong><ul><li>Who was the last strong performer you hired?</li><li>Have you retained your strongest performers?</li><li>What strong performers want to join your team?</li><li>Which peers consider your team highly effective?</li><li>When did an executive describe your team as exceptional?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ownership</strong><ul><li>When did you or your team overcome the odds to deliver something important? (Would your stakeholders agree?)</li><li>What’s the last difficult problem you solved that stayed solved (rather than reoccurring)?</li><li>When did you last solve the problem first before addressing cross-team gaps?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Alignment</strong><ul><li>When was the last time you were surprised by a stakeholder? What could you do to prevent that reoccuring?</li><li>How does a new stakeholder understand your prioritization tradeoffs (incl rationale)?</li><li>When did you last disappoint a stakeholder without damaging your relationship?</li><li>What stakeholders would join your company because they trust you?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Taste</strong><ul><li>What’s a recent decision that is meaningfully better because you were present?</li><li>If your product counterpart left, what decisions would you struggle to make?</li><li>Where’s a subtle clarification that significantly changed a design or launch?</li><li>How have you inflected team’s outcomes by seeing around corners?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Clarity</strong><ul><li>What’s a difficult trade-off you recently helped your team make?</li><li>How could you enable them to make that same trade-off without your direct participation?</li><li>What’s a recent decision you made that was undone? How?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Navigating ambiguity</strong><ul><li>What problem have you worked on that was stuck before assisted, and unstuck afterwards?</li><li>How did you unstick it?</li><li>Do senior leaders bring ambiguous problems to you? Why?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Working across timescales</strong><ul><li>What’s a recent trade off you made between short and long-term priorities?</li><li>How do you inform these tradeoffs across timescales?</li><li>What long-term goals are you protecting at significant short-term cost?</li></ul></li></ol><p>Most of these questions stand on their own, but it’s worth briefly explaining
the “Have you ever been pulled into a SpecificSortOfProject by an executive?” questions.
My experience is that in most companies, executives will try to poach you onto their most
important problems that correspond to your strengths.
So if they’re never attempting to pull you in then either you’re not considered as particularly
strong on that dimensions, or you’re already very saturated with other work such that it doesn’t
seem possible to pull you in.</p><h3 id="are-core-skills-the-same-over-time">Are “core skills” the same over time?</h3><p>While those groupings of “core” and “growth” skills are obvious groupings to me,
what I came to appreciate while writing this is that some skills swap between core to growth
as the fads evolve.
Where <em>execution</em> is a foundational skill today, it was less of a core skill in the hypergrowth era,
and even less in the investor era.</p><p>This is the fundamentally tricky part of succeeding as an engineering manager across fads:
you need a sufficiently broad base across each of these skills to be successful, otherwise
you’re very likely to be viewed as a weak manager when the eras unpredictably end.</p><h2 id="stay-energized-to-stay-engaged">Stay energized to stay engaged</h2><p>The “<a href="https://lethain.com/frameworks-decision-making/">Manage your priorities and energy</a>” chapter in
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Executives-Primer-Impactful-Leadership/dp/1098149483/"><em>The Engineering Executive’s Primer</em></a>
captures an important reality that took me too long to understand:
the perfect allocation of work is not the mathematically ideal allocation that maximizes impact.
Instead, it’s the balance between that mathematical ideal and doing
things that energize you enough to stay motivated over the long haul.
If you’re someone who loves writing software, that might involve writing a bit more than helpful to your team.
If you’re someone who loves streamlining an organization, it might be improving a friction-filled process that is a personal affront, even if it’s not causing <em>that much</em> overall inefficiency.</p><h2 id="forty-year-career">Forty-year career</h2><p>Similarly to the question of prioritizing activities to stay energized, there’s also understanding
where you are in your career, an idea I explored in <a href="https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/">A forty-year career</a>.</p><p><img src="https://lethain.com/static/blog/2019/40-year-hero.png" alt="Diagram of different ways to prioritize roles across your career"></p><p>For each role, you have the chance to prioritize across different dimensions like pace, people, prestige, profit, or learning.
There’s no “right decision,” and there are always tradeoffs.
The decisions you make early in your career will compound over the following forty years.
You also have to operate within the constraints of your life today and your possible lives tomorrow.
Early in my career, I had few responsibilities to others, and had the opportunity to work extremely hard
at places like Uber. Today, with more family responsibilities, I am unwilling to make the tradeoffs to
consistently work that way, which has real implications on how I think about which roles to prioritize
over time.</p><p>Recognizing these tradeoffs, and making them deliberately, is one of the highest value things you can do
to shape your career. Most importantly, it’s extremely hard to have a career at all if you don’t think about
these dimensions and have a healthy amount of self-awareness to understand the tradeoffs that will allow you
to stay engaged over half a lifetime.</p><p><time datetime="2025-10-26T04:00:00-07:00">Published on October 26, 2025.</time></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><bodycopy>Written by EMILY SNEDDON<br>
Published on 6TH NOVEMBER 2025
<p>


<span>










<a href="https://www.emilysneddon.com/fransans" target="_blank">Fran Sans</a> is a display font in every sense of the term. It’s an interpretation of the destination displays found on some of the light rail vehicles that service the city of San Francisco.<media-item autoplay="true" disable-zoom="true" hash="J2600265671666234692990740506745" loop="true" media-style="border-color: #d02a00; border-width: 0.3rem; border-style: solid;" muted="true" uses="inline-part-styles"><figcaption slot="caption">SFMTA Photo Department</figcaption></media-item><p>

I say <i>some</i> because destination displays aren’t consistently used across the city’s transit system. In fact, SF has an unusually high number of independent public transit agencies. Unlike New York, Chicago or L.A., which each have one, maybe two, San Francisco and the greater Bay Area have over two dozen. Each agency, with its own models of buses and trains, use different destination displays, creating an eclectic patchwork of typography across the city.</p><p>

Among them, one display in particular has always stood out to me: the LCD panel displays inside Muni’s Breda Light Rail Vehicles. I remember first noticing them on a Saturday in October on the N-Judah, heading to the Outer Sunset for a shrimp hoagie. This context is important, as anyone who’s spent an October weekend in SF knows this is the optimal vibe to really take in the beauty of the city.&nbsp;</p><media-item disable-zoom="true" hash="Y2571762958662850480571347675257" media-style="border-color: #d02a00; border-width: 0.3rem; border-style: solid;" uses="inline-part-styles"></media-item><p>
What caught my eye was how the displays look mechanical and yet distinctly personal. Constructed on a 3×5 grid, the characters are made up of geometric modules: squares, quarter-circles, and angled forms. Combined, these modules create imperfect, almost primitive letterforms, revealing a utility and charm that feels distinctly like the San Francisco I’ve come to know.</p><p>


This balance of utility and charm seems to show up everywhere in San Francisco and its history. The Golden Gate’s “International Orange” started as nothing more than a rust-proof primer, yet is now the city’s defining colour. The Painted Ladies became multicoloured icons after the 1960s Colourist movement covered decades of grey paint. Even the steepness of the streets was once an oversight in city planning but has since been romanticised in films and on postcards. So perhaps it is unsurprising that I would find this same utility and charm in a place as small and functional as a train sign.</p><p>
To learn more about these displays, I visited the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency’s (SFMTA) Electronics Shop at Balboa Park. There, technician Armando Lumbad had set up one of the signs. They each feature one large LCD panel which displays the line name, and twenty-four smaller ones to display the destination. The loose spacing of the letters and fluorescent backlighting gives the sign a raw, analogue quality. Modern LED dot-matrix displays are far more efficient and flexible, but to me, they lack the awkwardness that makes these Breda signs so delightful.</p><media-item autoplay="true" browser-default="false" disable-zoom="true" hash="A2571773420420157235690484312185" limit-by="width" loop="true" media-style="border-color: #d02a00; border-width: 0.3rem; border-style: solid;" muted="true" scale="100" uses="inline-part-styles"></media-item><p>

Armando showed me how the signs work. He handed me a printed matrix table listing every line and destination, each paired with a three-digit code. On route, train operators punch the code into a control panel at the back of the display, and the LCD blocks light on specific segments of the grid to build each letter. I picked code 119, and Armando entered it for me. A few seconds later the panels revealed my own stop: the N-Judah at Church &amp; Duboce. There in the workshop, devoid of the context of the trains and the commute, the display looked almost monolithic, or sculptural, and I have since fantasised whether it would be possible to ship one of these home to Australia.</p><p>


Looking inside of the display, I found labels identifying the make and model. The signs were designed and manufactured by Trans-Lite, Inc., a company based in Milford, Connecticut that specialised in transport signage from 1959 until its acquisition by the Nordic firm Teknoware in 2012. After lots of amateur detective work, and with the help from an anonymous Reddit user in a Connecticut community group, I was connected with Gary Wallberg, Senior Engineer at Trans-Lite and the person responsible for the design of these very signs back in 1999.</p><media-item disable-zoom="true" hash="E2571778130962277154087875422329" media-style="border-color: #d02a00; border-width: 0.3rem; border-style: solid;" uses="inline-part-styles"><figcaption slot="caption">Original drawings of the display, courtesy of William Maley Jnr, former owner and CEO of TRANS-LITE, INC.</figcaption></media-item><p>
Learning that the alphabet came from an engineer really explains its temperament and why I was drawn to it in the first place. The signs were designed for sufficiency: fixed segments, fixed grid, and no extras. Characters were created only as destinations required them, while other characters, like the Q, X, and much of the punctuation, were never programmed into the signs. In reducing everything to its bare essentials, somehow character emerged, and it’s what inspired me to design Fran Sans.</p><p>

I shared some initial drawings with Dave Foster of <a href="https://www.fostertype.com/" target="_blank">Foster Type</a> who encouraged me to get the font software Glyphs and turn it into my first working font. From there, I broke down the anatomy of the letters into modules, then used them like Lego to build out a full set: uppercase A–Z, numerals, core punctuation.&nbsp;</p><media-item hash="Q2572899645280231776139518191737" media-style="border-width: 0rem; border-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.85); border-style: solid;" uses="inline-part-styles"></media-item><p>

Some glyphs remain unsolved in this first version, for example the standard @ symbol refuses to squeeze politely into the 3×5 logic. Lowercase remains a question for the future, and would likely mean reconsidering the grid. But, as with the displays themselves, I am judging Fran Sans as sufficient for now.</p><media-item disable-zoom="true" hash="A2606685398315595430709885708409" scale="100%"><figcaption slot="caption">Grid comparison. Left is a photo of the display, right is Fran Sans.</figcaption></media-item><p>


Getting up close to these signs, you’ll notice Fran Sans’ gridlines are simplified even from its real‑life muse, but my hope is that its character remains. Specifically: the N and the zero, where the unusually thick diagonals close in on the counters; and the Z and 7, whose diagonals can feel uncomfortably thin. I’ve also noticed the centre of the M can scale strangely and read like an H at small sizes, but in fairness, this type was never designed for the kind of technical detail so many monospaced fonts aim for. Throughout the process I tried to protect these unorthodox moments, because to me, they determined the success of this interpretation.</p><media-item disable-zoom="true" hash="U2634632898338157057546050119801"></media-item><p>

Fran Sans comes in three styles: Solid, Tile, and Panel, each building in visual complexity. The decision to include variations, particularly the Solid style, was inspired by my time working at <a href="https://christopherdoyle.co/" target="_blank">Christopher Doyle &amp; Co.</a> There, we worked with Bell Shakespeare, Australia’s national theatre company dedicated to the works of William Shakespeare. The equity of the Bell Shakespeare brand lies in its typography, which is a beautiful custom typeface called Hotspur, designed and produced by none other than Dave Foster.</p><media-item disable-zoom="true" hash="C2633085234643522250621956958329" href="https://christopherdoyle.co/" media-style="border-color: #d02a00; border-width: 0.3rem; border-style: solid;" target="_blank" uses="inline-part-styles"><figcaption slot="caption">Hotspur by DAVE FOSTER.</figcaption></media-item><p>

Often, brand fonts are chosen or designed to convey a single feeling. Maybe it’s warmth and friendliness, or a sense of tech and innovation. But what I’ve always loved about the Bell typeface is how one weight could serve both Shakespeare’s comedies and tragedies, simply by shifting scale, spacing, or alignment. Hotspur has the gravity to carry the darkness of <i>Titus Andronicus</i> and the roundness to convey the humour of <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>. And while Fran Sans Solid is technically no Hotspur, I wanted it to share that same versatility.</p><media-item disable-zoom="true" hash="K2633083737395092763912490494073" href="https://christopherdoyle.co/" media-style="border-color: #d02a00; border-width: 0.3rem; border-style: solid;" target="_blank" uses="inline-part-styles"><figcaption slot="caption">Bell Shakespeare by CHRISTOPHER DOYLE &amp; CO.</figcaption></media-item><p>

Further inspiration for Fran Sans came from the <a href="https://letterformarchive.org/" target="_blank">Letterform Archive</a>, the world’s leading typography archive, based in San Francisco. Librarian and archivist <a href="https://www.kateallalong.com/" target="_blank">Kate Long Stellar</a> thoughtfully curated a research visit filled with modular typography spanning most of the past century. On the table were two pieces that had a significant impact on Fran Sans and are now personal must-sees at the archive. First, Joan Trochut’s <i>Tipo Veloz</i> “Fast Type” (1942) was created during the Second World War when resources were scarce. <i>Tipo Veloz</i> gave printers the ability to draw with type, rearranging modular pieces to form letters, ornaments and even illustrations.</p><p>

Second, Zuzana Licko’s process work for <i>Lo-Res</i> (1985), an Emigre typeface, opened new ways of thinking about how ideas move between the physical and the digital and then back again. Seeing how <i>Lo-Res</i> was documented through iterations and variations gave the typeface a depth and richness that changed my understanding of how fonts are built. At some point I want to explore physical applications for Fran Sans out of respect for its origins, since it is impossible to fully capture the display’s charm on screen.</p><media-item disable-zoom="true" hash="Q2572944407798912902336988096633" media-style="border-color: #d02a00; border-width: 0.3rem; border-style: solid;" uses="inline-part-styles"><figcaption slot="caption">Letterform Archive research visit, MAY 2025.</figcaption></media-item><p>

Back at the SFMTA, Armando told me the Breda vehicles are being replaced, and with them their destination displays will be swapped for newer LED dot-matrix units that are more efficient and easier to maintain. By the end of 2025 the signs that inspired Fran Sans will disappear from the city, taking with them a small but distinctive part of the city’s voice. 
That feels like a real loss. San Francisco is always reinventing itself, yet its charm lies in how much of its history still shows through. My hope is that Fran Sans can inspire a deeper appreciation for the imperfections that give our lives and our cities character. Life is so rich when ease and efficiency are not the measure.</p></span><span>For commercial and non-commercial use of FRAN SANS, please get in touch: <a href="mailto:emily@emilysneddon.com" rel="mailto">emily@emilysneddon.com</a><p>WITH THANKS<br>Dave Foster, for being my go-to at every stage of this project.<br>Maria Doreuli, for thoughtfully reviewing Fran Sans.<br>Maddy Carrucan, for the words that always keep me dreamy.<br>Jeremy Menzies, for the photography of the Breda vehicles.<br>Kate Long Stellar, for curating a research visit on modular typography.<br>Angie Wang, for suggesting it and helping to make it happen.<br>Vasiliy Tsurkan, for inviting me into to the SFMTA workshop.<br>Armando Lumbad, for maintaining the signs that I love so much.<br>Rick Laubscher, for putting me in touch with the SFMTA.<br>William Maley Jr, for opening up the TRANS-LITE, INC. archives.<br>Gary Wallberg, for designing and engineering the original signs.<br>Gregory Wallberg, for responding to a very suspicious facebook post.<br>Reddit u/steve31086, for sleuthing the details of William Maley Jr.</p></span><span></span><span><span>OUTSIDE MY LIFE,<br>INSIDE THE DREAM.<p>

<p dir="auto">It turns out that MacOS Tahoe can generate and use secure-enclave backed SSH keys! This replaces projects like <a href="https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive">https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive</a></p>
<p dir="auto">There is a shared library <code>/usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib</code> that traditionally has been used to add smartcard support
to ssh by implementing <code>PKCS11Provider</code> interface. However since recently it also implements <code>SecurityKeyProivder</code>
which supports loading keys directly from the secure enclave! <code>SecurityKeyProvider</code> is what is normally used to talk to FIDO2 devices (e.g. <code>libfido2</code> can be used to talk to your Yubikey). However you can now use it to talk to your Secure Enclave instead!</p>

        <article>

        

    <div>
        <p>I’m not saying this will definitely happen, but I think we could be on the cusp of a significant shift in Windows market share for consumer computers. It is not going to drop to 2% in a year or anything, but I feel like a few pieces are coming together that could move the needle in a way we have not seen in several decades. There are three things on my mind .</p><p>Number one is that Microsoft just does not feel like a consumer tech company at all anymore. Yes, they have always been much more corporate than the likes of Apple or Google, but it really shows in the last few years as they seem to only have energy for AI and web services. If you are not a customer who is a major business or a developer creating the next AI-powered app, Microsoft does not seem to care about you.</p><p>I just do not see excitement there. The only thing of note they have added to Windows in the last five years is Copilot, and I have yet to meet a normal human being who enjoys using it. And all the Windows 11 changes seem to have just gone over about as well as a lead balloon. I just do not think they care at all about Windows with consumers.</p><p>The second thing is the affordable MacBook rumored to be coming out in 2026. This will be a meaningfully cheaper MacBook that people can purchase at price points that many Windows computers have been hovering around for many years. Considering Apple’s focus on consumers first and a price point that can get more people in the door, it seems like that could move the needle.</p><p>The third thing is gamers. Gamers use Windows largely because they have to, not because they are passionate about it. Maybe they were passionate about it in the 90s, but any passion has gone away. Now it is just the operating system they use to launch Steam. In early 2026, Valve is going to release the Steam Machine after a few years of success with the Steam Deck. We will see how they do there, but what they are doing is releasing a machine that runs Windows games on Linux. And it runs them really well. The Steam Deck has proven that over the last few years. If someone can package up a version of Linux that is optimized for gamers, then I think there is a meaningful number of PC gamers who would happily run that on their computer instead.</p><p>I do not know if this is going to happen. It is always easy to be cynical and suggest everything will stay the same, and I understand that markets of this size take a long time to change. However, it just feels like there are some things happening right now that are going to move the needle, and I am excited to see what happens.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>The fetish modern Internet users have with “dark mode” has to stop, as does the rhetoric they typically use to advance their arguments, stuff like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>blasts my eyeballs with full-beam daylight.</p></blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every time I open it, I physically recoil like a Victorian child seeing electricity for the first time.</p></blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My retinas and I would be very grateful</p></blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the light of a thousand suns</p></blockquote>
<p>Give me a break. If normal mode bothers you so much, it says one thing: <em>your ambient lighting is crap</em> . That will kill your eyesight and no, dark mode won’t save you. Fix your lighting instead of bullying the rest of the Internet into eyesight-damaging practices.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article id="article-body"><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Sex trafficking on Meta platforms was both difficult to report and widely tolerated, according to a court filing unsealed Friday. In a plaintiffs’ brief filed as part of a major lawsuit against four social media companies, Instagram’s former head of safety and well-being Vaishnavi Jayakumar testified that when she joined Meta in 2020 she was shocked to learn that the company had a “17x” strike policy for accounts that reportedly engaged in the “trafficking of humans for sex.”&nbsp;</p><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“You could incur 16 violations for prostitution and sexual solicitation, and upon the 17th violation, your account would be suspended,” Jayakumar reportedly testified, adding that “by any measure across the industry, [it was] a very, very high strike threshold.” The plaintiffs claim that this testimony is corroborated by internal company documentation.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The brief, filed by plaintiffs in the Northern District of California, alleges that Meta was aware of serious harms on its platform and engaged in a broad pattern of deceit to downplay risks to young users. According to the brief, Meta was aware that millions of adult strangers were contacting minors on its sites; that its products exacerbated mental health issues in teens; and that content related to eating disorders, suicide, and child sexual abuse was frequently detected, yet rarely removed. According to the brief, the company failed to disclose these harms to the public or to Congress, and refused to implement safety fixes that could have protected young users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“Meta has designed social media products and platforms that it is aware are addictive to kids, and they’re aware that those addictions lead to a whole host of serious mental health issues,” says Previn Warren, the co-lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the case. “Like tobacco, this is a situation where there are dangerous products that were marketed to kids,” Warren adds. “They did it anyway, because more usage meant more profits for the company.”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The following allegations against Meta come from the brief filed in an unprecedented multidistrict litigation. More than 1,800 plaintiffs—including children and parents, school districts, and state attorneys general—have joined together in a suit alleging that the parent companies behind Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and YouTube “relentlessly pursued a strategy of growth at all costs, recklessly ignoring the impact of their products on children’s mental and physical health,” according to their master complaint. The newly unsealed allegations about Meta are just one small part of the sprawling suit. (TIME filed a motion to intervene in the case to ensure public access to court records; the motion was denied.)</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The plaintiffs’ brief, first reported by TIME, purports to be based on sworn depositions of current and former Meta executives, internal communications, and company research and presentations obtained during the lawsuit’s discovery process. It includes quotes and excerpts from thousands of pages of testimony and internal company documents. TIME was not able to independently view the underlying testimony or research quoted in the brief, since those documents remain under seal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content"><strong>Read More:</strong> <em><a href="https://time.com/7334078/matthew-bergman-social-media-victims-lawsuits/">The Lawyer Suing Social Media Companies On Behalf of Kids</a></em></p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">But the brief still paints a damning picture of the company’s internal research and deliberations about issues that have long plagued its platforms. Plaintiffs claim that since 2017, Meta has aggressively pursued young users, even as its internal research suggested its social media products could be addictive and dangerous to kids. Meta employees proposed multiple ways to mitigate these harms, according to the brief, but were repeatedly blocked by executives who feared that new safety features would hamper teen engagement or user growth.</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“We strongly disagree with these allegations, which rely on cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture," a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to TIME. "The full record will show that for over a decade, we have listened to parents, researched issues that matter most, and made real changes to protect teens – like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with controls to manage their teens’ experiences. We’re proud of the progress we’ve made and we stand by our record.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">In the years since the lawsuit was filed, Meta has implemented new safety features designed to address some of the problems described by plaintiffs. In 2024, Meta unveiled Instagram Teen Accounts, which defaults any user between 13 and 18 into an account that is automatically private, limits sensitive content, turns off notifications at night, and doesn’t allow messaging from unconnected adults. “We know parents are worried about their teens having unsafe or inappropriate experiences online, and that’s why we’ve significantly reimagined the Instagram experience for tens of millions of teens with new Teen Accounts,” a Meta spokeswoman told TIME in June. “These accounts provide teens with built-in protections to automatically limit who’s contacting them and the content they’re seeing, and teens under 16 need a parent’s permission to change those settings. We also give parents oversight over their teens’ use of Instagram, with ways to see who their teens are chatting with and block them from using the app for more than 15 minutes a day, or for certain periods of time, like during school or at night.”</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">And yet the plaintiffs’ brief suggests that Meta resisted safety changes like these for years.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The brief quotes testimony from Brian Boland, Meta’s former vice president of partnerships who worked at the company for 11 years and resigned in 2020. “My feeling then and my feeling now is that they don’t meaningfully care about user safety,” he allegedly said. “It’s not something that they spend a lot of time on. It’s not something they think about. And I really think they don’t care.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">After the plaintiffs’ brief was unsealed late Friday night, Meta did not immediately respond to TIME’s requests for comment.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Here are some of the most notable allegations from the plaintiffs’ omnibus brief:&nbsp;</p><h2>Allegation: Meta had a high threshold for "sex trafficking" content—and no way to report child sexual content</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Despite Instagram’s “zero tolerance” policy for child sexual abuse material, the platform did not offer users a simple way to report child sexual abuse content, according to the brief. Plaintiffs allege that Jayakumar raised the issue multiple times when she joined Meta in 2020, but was told it would be too difficult to address. Yet Instagram allowed users to easily report far less serious violations, like “spam,” “intellectual property violation” and “promotion of firearms,” according to plaintiffs.</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Jayakumar was even more shocked to learn that Instagram had a disturbingly high tolerance for sex trafficking on the platform. According to the brief, she testified that Meta had a “17x” strike policy for accounts that reportedly engaged in the “trafficking of humans for sex,” meaning it would take at least 16 reports for an account to be deleted.   </p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“Meta never told parents, the public, or the Districts that it doesn’t delete accounts that have engaged over fifteen times in sex trafficking,” the plaintiffs wrote. </p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">A Meta spokesperson disputed this allegation to TIME, saying the company has for years removed accounts immediately if it suspects them of human trafficking or exploitation and has made it easier over time for users to report content that violates child-exploitation policies. </p><h2>Allegation: Meta "lied to Congress" about its knowledge of harms on the platform</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-content">For years, plaintiffs allege, Meta’s internal research had found that teenagers who frequently use Instagram and Facebook have higher rates of anxiety and depression.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">In late 2019, according to the brief, Meta designed a “deactivation study,” which found that users who stopped using Facebook and Instagram for a week showed lower rates of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Meta halted the study and did not publicly disclose the results, stating that the research study was biased by the “existing media narratives around the company.” (A Meta spokesperson told TIME that the study was initially conceived as a pair of one-weeks pilots, and researchers declined to continue it because it found that the only reductions in feelings of depression, anxiety, and loneliness were among people who already believed Facebook was bad for them.)</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">At least one Meta employee was uncomfortable with the implications of this decision: “If the results are bad and we don’t publish and they leak,” this employee wrote, according to the brief, “is it going to look like tobacco companies doing research and knowing cigs were bad and then keeping that info to themselves?”</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Indeed, in December 2020, when the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the company in a set of written questions whether it was “able to determine whether increased use of its platform among teenage girls has any correlation with increased signs of depression” and “increased signs of anxiety,” the company offered only a one-word answer: “No.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">To the plaintiffs in the case, the implication is clear: “The company never publicly disclosed the results of its deactivation study. Instead, Meta lied to Congress about what it knew.”</p><h2>Allegation: The company knew Instagram was letting adult strangers connect with teenagers</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-content">For years <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/instagram-has-massive-harassment-problem/572890/">Instagram has had </a>a well-documented problem of adults harassing teens. Around 2019, company researchers recommended making all teen accounts private by default in order to prevent adult strangers from connecting with kids, according to the plaintiffs’ brief. Instead of implementing this recommendation, Meta asked its growth team to study the potential impact of making all teen accounts private. The growth team was pessimistic, according to the brief, and responded that the change would likely reduce engagement.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">By 2020, the growth team had determined that a private-by-default setting would result in a loss of 1.5 million monthly active teens a year on Instagram. The plaintiffs’ brief quotes an unnamed employee as saying: “taking away unwanted interactions… is likely to lead to a potentially untenable problem with engagement and growth.” Over the next several months, plaintiffs allege, Meta’s policy, legal, communications, privacy, and well-being teams all recommended making teen accounts private by default, arguing that the switch “will increase teen safety” and was in line with expectations from users, parents, and regulators. But Meta did not launch the feature that year.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Safety researchers were dismayed, according to excerpts of an internal conversation quoted in the filing. One allegedly grumbled: “Isn’t safety the whole point of this team?”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“Meta knew that placing teens into a default-private setting would have eliminated 5.4 million unwanted interactions a day,” the plaintiffs wrote. Still, Meta didn’t make the fix. Instead, inappropriate interactions between adults and kids on Instagram skyrocketed to 38 times that on Facebook Messenger, according to the brief. The launch of Instagram Reels allegedly compounded the problem. It allowed young teenagers to broadcast short videos to a wide audience, including adult strangers.</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content"><strong>Read More:</strong> <em><a href="https://time.com/7327229/raul-torrez-new-mexico-meta-lawsuit/">The AG Putting Big Tech On Trial</a></em>.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">An internal 2022 audit allegedly found that Instagram’s Accounts You May Follow feature recommended 1.4 million potentially inappropriate adults to teenage users in a single day. By 2023, according to the plaintiffs, Meta knew that they were recommending minors to potentially suspicious adults and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">It wasn’t until 2024 that Meta rolled out default privacy settings to all teen accounts. In the four years it took the company to implement their own safety recommendations, teens experienced billions of unwanted interactions with strangers online. Inappropriate encounters between teens and adults were common enough, according to the brief, that the company had an acronym for them: “IIC,” or “inappropriate interactions with children.”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">A Meta spokesperson said the company has defaulted teens under 16 to private accounts since 2021, began defaulting teens under 18 into private accounts with the introduction of its Teen Accounts program, and has <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/combating-online-predators/">taken steps</a> to protect users from online predators. </p></div><div><h2>Allegation: Meta aggressively targeted young users</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Meta feared young users would abandon Facebook and Instagram for their competitors. Acquiring and keeping young users became a central business goal. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggested that “teen time spent be our top goal of 2017,” according to a company executive quoted in the brief. That has remained the case, plaintiffs allege; internal company documents from 2024 stated that “acquiring new teen users is mission critical to the success of Instagram.” (A Meta spokesperson said time spent on its platforms is not currently a company goal.)</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Meta launched a campaign to connect with school districts and paid organizations like the National Parent Teacher Association and Scholastic to conduct outreach to schools and families. Meanwhile, according to the brief, Meta used location data to push notifications to students in “school blasts,” presumably as part of an attempt to increase youth engagement during the school day. As one employee allegedly put it: “One of the things we need to optimize for is sneaking a look at your phone under your desk in the middle of Chemistry :)”.</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Though Meta aggressively pursued young users, it may not have known exactly how old those new users were. Whistleblower <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/6ccd5abd-cbb9-5107-d48d-b99e821eb244/2025-09-09%20-%20QFR%20Responses%20-%20Sattizahn.pdf">Jason Sattizahn recently</a> testified to Congress that Meta does not reliably know the age of its users. (Meta pushed back on Sattizahn’s testimony, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/meta-whistleblower-research-kids-vr-former-employees-stock-rcna230131">saying in a statement to NBC</a> that his claims were “nonsense” and “based on selectively leaked internal documents that were picked specifically to craft a false narrative.”) In 2022, according to the plaintiffs’ brief, there were 216 million users on Meta platforms whose age was “unknown.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Federal law requires social media platforms to observe various data-privacy safeguards for users under 13, and Meta policy states that users under 13 are not allowed on its platforms. Yet the plaintiffs’ court filing claims Meta knew that children under 13 used the company’s products anyway. Internal research cited in the brief suggested there were 4 million users under 13 on Instagram in 2015; by 2018, the plaintiffs claim, Meta knew that roughly 40% of children aged 9 to 12 said they used Instagram daily.</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The plaintiffs allege that this was a deliberate business strategy. The brief describes a coordinated effort to acquire young users that included studying the psychology and digital behavior of “tweens” and exploring new products designed for “users as young as 5-10.”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Internally, some employees expressed disgust at the attempt to target preteens. “Oh good, we’re going after &lt;13 year olds now?” one wrote, according to the brief. “Zuck has been talking about that for a while...targeting 11 year olds feels like tobacco companies a couple decades ago (and today). Like we’re seriously saying ‘we have to hook them young’ here.”</p><h2>Allegation: Meta's executives initially shelved efforts to make Instagram less toxic for teens</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-content">To combat toxic “social comparison,” in 2019 Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri announced a new product feature that would “hide” likes on posts. Meta researchers had determined that hiding likes would make users “significantly less likely to feel worse about themselves,” according to the plaintiffs’ brief. The initiative was code-named Project Daisy.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">But after a series of tests, Meta backtracked on Project Daisy. It determined the feature was “pretty negative to FB metrics,” including ad revenue, according to the plaintiffs’ brief, which quotes an unnamed employee on the growth team insisting: “It’s a social comparison app, fucking get used to it.”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">A similar debate took place over the app’s beauty filters. Plaintiffs claim that an internal review concluded beauty filters exacerbated the “risk and maintenance of several mental health concerns, including body dissatisfaction, eating disorders, and body dysmorphic disorder,” and that Meta knew that “children are particularly vulnerable.” Meta banned beauty filters in 2019, only to roll them back out the following year after the company realized that banning beauty filters would have a “negative growth impact,” according to the plaintiffs’ brief.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Other company researchers allegedly built an AI “classifier” to identify content that would lead to negative appearance comparison, so that Meta could avoid recommending it to vulnerable kids. But Mosseri allegedly killed the project, disappointing developers who “felt like they had a solution” to “a big problem.”</p></div><div><h2>Allegation: Meta doesn't automatically remove harmful content, including self-harm content</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-content">While Meta developed AI tools to monitor the platforms for harmful content, the company didn’t automatically delete that content even when it determined with “100% confidence” that it violated Meta’s policies against child sexual-abuse material or eating-disorder content. Meta’s AI classifiers did not automatically delete posts that glorified self-harm unless they were 94% certain they violated platform policy, according to the plaintiffs’ brief. As a result, most of that content remained on the platform, where teenage users often discovered it. In a 2021 internal company survey cited by plaintiffs, more than 8% of respondents aged 13 to 15 reported having seen someone harm themselves, or threaten to do so, on Instagram during the past week.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content"><strong>Read More: </strong><em><a href="https://time.com/7310444/instagram-lawsuit-self-harm/">‘Everything I Learned About Suicide, I Learned On Instagram.’</a></em></p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">A Meta spokesperson said the company reports more child sexual-abuse material than any other service and uses an array of tools to proactively find that content, including photo and video-matching technologies as well as machine learning. The spokesperson said human reviewers assess content flagged before it is deleted to ensure it violates policies, prevent mistakes that could affect users, and maintain the integrity of the company's detection databases. </p><h2>Allegation: Meta knew its products were addictive, but publicly downplayed the harms</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The addictive nature of the company’s products wasn’t a secret internally. “Oh my gosh yall IG is a drug,” one of the company’s user-experience researchers allegedly wrote to a colleague. “We’re basically pushers.”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Meta does not officially study addiction to its products, plaintiffs allege; it studies “problematic use.” In 2018, company researchers surveyed 20,000 Facebook users in the U.S. and found that 58% had some level of “problematic use”—55% mild, and 3.1% severe. But when Meta published an account of this research the following year, only the smaller number of users with “severe” problematic use was mentioned. “We estimate (as an upper bound) that 3.1% of Facebook users in the U.S. experience problematic use,” <a href="https://scontent-sjc6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/240848801_924166131530538_1308218914254273445_n.pdf?_nc_cat=111&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=e280be&amp;_nc_ohc=C_tgb_3384YQ7kNvwHuZaN0&amp;_nc_oc=Adm09HFJ1ktJoo9WIE0m4qDw6-OlF_2k7EQF8rnKbmwRLRsOB1cDAsP3XLwyT8q2accez_oKoOZRXzLKpBMUCsHU&amp;_nc_zt=14&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-sjc6-1.xx&amp;_nc_gid=WZWa2peYFXQxwOygthrZ6g&amp;oh=00_AfhNhtKp-IiYwptqBR42Y2exRT2A9v9zp5xlCdNIzxAJ_A&amp;oe=6925C501">wrote the researchers</a>. The other 55% of users are not mentioned anywhere in the public report.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Plaintiffs allege that Meta’s safety team proposed features designed to lessen addiction, only to see them set aside or watered down. One employee who helped develop a “quiet mode” feature said it was shelved because Meta was concerned that this feature would negatively impact metrics related to growth and usage.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Around the same time, another user-experience researcher at Instagram allegedly recommended that Meta inform the public about its research findings: “Because our product exploits weaknesses in the human psychology to promote product engagement and time spent,” the researcher wrote, Meta needed to “alert people to the effect that the product has on their brain.”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Meta did not.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content"><em>This story has been updated to reflect additional comments from Meta. </em></p></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <p>Google, the Silicon Valley company <em>par excellence</em>, proclaimed to “organise the world’s information” and adopted “don’t be evil” as its corporate motto. And what could possibly be wrong with such aspirations? Indeed, most company leaders and high-tech workers, in the Valley, genuinely believe they are “making the world a better place” while also making money.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley is the progressive face of capitalism. We’ve experienced it, intimately. Billions of people, across the globe, enjoy real benefits from searching the world’s information, connecting with people across time and space, and carrying a supercomputers in their pockets. Silicon Valley doesn’t obviously throw workers into factories and mines for endless hours on low pay; such images are hidden, rendered distant by the supply chain . Instead, the Valley, in our imaginations, is populated by knowledge workers, a diverse and smart workforce that designs, solves, and codes in humane office spaces, with above average wages, ping pong, cafeterias, flexible working hours, sleeping cubicles. What’s not to like?</p>
<p>We could consider the Valley’s hidden workers, those who clean, wait tables, wash cars, nanny, deliver packages, tend gardens, fix infrastructure for poverty wages; we could explore the trailer parks down the road from Google HQ, or document the shootings in the streets, the homeless that push shopping trolleys up and down the El Camino, their world a bundle of rags; or the gun shops that sell semi-automatics, the out-of-control, over-staffed police, armed with military-grade cast-me-downs, that regularly gun down the poor; the families crowded into small apartments, the father who spends his days scouring trash bins for recyclable bottles to trade for cash, the human trafficking of women, the prostitution, coerced to serve a predominately male workforce; or the disciplining and harassment of the undocumented, the deportations, the splitting up and destruction of families; or the local charities that collect food for kids, during seasonal holidays, since outside of school time their families cannot provide; or the extraordinarily high incarceration rates that control the surplus labour force, the armed guards on campuses and in schools, office complexes and shop interiors; or the poverty, the child who cannot concentrate in class since their teeth are rotting in their mouth, the extreme and devastating inequalities in wealth and income, the untreated illnesses and injuries, for lack of medical access, the widespread use of antidepressants, the addictions, the dispossessed, the broken dreams and the crying … </p>
<p>Yet these symptoms of a broken and decaying society are studiously ignored, repressed, unmentioned by Silicon Valley’s middle and upper classes. Psychological repression is widespread amongst the highly paid of the Valley. It’s a defence: it’s just too damn painful to contemplate the full horror of social reality. And life can be organised to avoid it, or deny it. So many don’t even notice.</p>
<p>I could mention all the evil business models, where vast computing power and fancy algorithms trawl our digital footprints to track and surveil, to sell and manipulate, to intensify our addictions; and we might reflect on the Valley’s enormous and continuing contributions to building military  machines that rain down death and destruction. </p>
<p>Instead, here, in this article, I want to point to the root problem, <em>the ultimate source of evil</em>, and explain why Silicon Valley is hypocrisy on a grand scale. The Valley’s movers and shakers believe they are progressive, that entrepreneurial capitalism is the road to utopia. But it’s not. In fact, the opposite is the case: the Valley is a cause of this horror, of the social ills, and the social breakdown that it must repress: it is both responsible and culpable for creating a dystopia.</p>
<p>I want all the talented, hopeful, optimistic high-tech workers, who genuinely want to make the world a better place, who are about to found a new and exciting startup, to just take a short pause, to stop, look around, think, reflect and reconsider: <em>the kind of firm you incorporate, the institutional rules you adopt, is precisely the choice point between doing evil and doing good</em>.</p>
<p>I will try to explain. My apologies if it takes a little while, since if the following facts were readily understood and generally accepted, then Silicon Valley would already be good, not evil, and I wouldn’t need to explain.</p>
<h2 id="silicon-valley-midwife-of-the-capitalist-firm">Silicon Valley: midwife of the capitalist firm</h2>
<p>The Valley is all about startups. They spring up all the time. New exciting and hopeful adventures. It’s like forming a band, but better.</p>
<p>In huge, mature corporations the social relations of production are obscured by layers of hierarchy and absentee ownership. But in a startup the power relations are direct and visible, and often share an office with you. You can observe the basic unit of production in capitalism—the capitalist firm—as if under a microscope.</p>
<p>Let’s lay out the property relations of a (slightly simplified) typical startup. </p>
<p>The startup has owner(s), usually “high net worth” individuals, either directly present or indirectly in the form of venture capital firms. Venture capital provides the initial funds for the new venture. The actual founders, the ones with the ideas and talent, but no money, also part own the firm. The divvying up of the initial share issue between founders and early investors is a detail. The founders, armed with a new injection of capital, then recruit workers by convincing them of “the vision”. These are the first employees. And off we go. </p>
<p>The owner(s) of the startup are in complete control, and their decisions are final. Owners can promote, demote, hire and fire anyone, at any time. Owners set wage levels, which are kept secret (and the workers, being earnest and highly disciplined, avoid this subject with each other—that would break a taboo). Startups are definitely not run on democratic lines: workers don’t get to appoint managers, set strategy, or distribute profits. Instead, the startup is a mini dictatorship: sure, there’s plenty of technical debate, and back-and-forth, and head scratching, but ultimately it’s a dictatorship.</p>
<p>The owners pays all input costs—such as office rental, computers, electricity and heating, labour etc. They own all outputs, such as new software or hardware, and any inventions (which, in the Valley, are aggressively patented). The owners are liable for any profits and losses of the company. The startup’s bank accounts are hidden from the workers, and out of their control.</p>
<p>This basic social relation—between profit-taking capitalist owners and wage-earning workers—is constitutive of capitalism. For example, today you can travel to Shropshire, England, and visit Ironbridge village, one of the birthplaces of the industrial revolution and “the silicon valley of the 1800s”. You can tour an early ironworks and see the great furnaces where workers toiled, the tiny administrative office (to dole out wages, and keep accounts), and nearby, on a large hill overlooking the site, the capitalists’ large and imposing mansions.</p>
<p>The form may have changed, but not the content. In this sense, Silicon Valley is deeply conservative. It proclaims to disrupt everything, and make all fresh, new and shiny—except this basic social relationship.</p>
<p>Almost all Silicon Valley workers accept these social relations as entirely natural, acceptable, and pretty much fair and equitable. The owners fund the company. They therefore “own the firm”. The owners risk a lot of capital, and the workers receive a good wage, based on supply and demand in the marketplace, plus some ramp-up time to try and invent new stuff, which is fun. What’s not to like? What’s the problem?</p>
<h2 id="silicon-valley-its-theft-all-the-way-down">Silicon Valley: it’s theft all the way down</h2>
<p>Startups reproduce, in embryo form, the wage system, where the capitalist owner hires-in labour at a pre-agreed rental price. In a capitalist firm, labour is just an another <em>ex ante</em> cost of production. The workers mix their labour with inputs and produce an output for sale. Normally, firms sell at prices that exceed their costs of production, which includes the cost of used-up inputs, rent, interest on capital loans, and wage costs etc. Any residual income then gets distributed as profit to the owner, or owners, of the firm.</p>
<p>Imagine that you and I agree to exchange something in the marketplace, say a second-hand iPhone on Ebay. You get the money, I get an iPhone. You may get a good deal, or I may get a good deal, depending on our “higgling and haggling” in the marketplace. Whether a fair price is struck, or not, there’s an exchange of something for something: some goods for some money. This social transaction satisfies a “principle of exchange”. We’ve swapped stuff, and no-one forced us to.</p>
<p>But let’s say I just took the iPhone from you. And you received no money at all. This violates the principle of exchange. I got something for nothing: some goods, some resources, for free. That’s theft. Obviously so.</p>
<p><em>All startups in Silicon Valley violate the principle of exchange and institute a system of theft</em>. They are theft-based institutions. If the startup is successful and grows, so does the theft, since theft is baked into the institutional structure of the firm, right from the get go. If the startup goes global, like an Apple, Facebook, or Google, then the cancer spreads and the theft takes place on a global scale.</p>
<p>But the theft is hidden. We need some reflection to really see it.</p>
<p>The workers in a startup are the actual cause of any profits it makes. We can demonstrate this with a simple thought experiment: imagine the workers stopped working. Would the firm have any possibility of making a profit, or if already profitable, continue to make that profit? But we don’t need to imagine. This is called a strike. And owners hate it, since it kills their profit.</p>
<p>So, in any company, including a startup, the workers create the value. </p>
<p>What, then, do the owners contribute or create?</p>
<p>The owners, or venture capitalists, contribute capital. They advance money to fund the startup until it (hopefully) starts making money. And then they expect a return. Since they’ve given something they should definitely get something back, otherwise we violate the principle of exchange. In fact, they should expect repayment of the sums advanced and—let’s be generous here—also a risk premium (since most startups fail without making profit) and, also—in order to be really straight and fair about this—some collateral as security (such as first dibs on any outstanding assets if the venture fails). This seems like a fair exchange.</p>
<p>It is. So far so good. </p>
<p>But if early investors merely did this—that is, simply advance some <em>loan capital</em>—they would not become the owners of the firm. Once the startup made money, the loan would be repaid (by the firm), and the early investors would have no further claims on the fruits of others’ labour (that is the value created by the workers).</p>
<p>The important point is this: loan capital does not violate the principle of exchange.</p>
<p>But Silicon Valley startups are not funded by loan capital. Venture capitalists want, and get, much more than this. They advance capital to a firm, but in addition to being repaid, they demand ownership of the firm, i.e. <em>equity capital</em>, and receive stock (shares in the firm). And so they “own the firm”. In consequence, once their initial loan and risk premium is repaid, they get even more: they retain a claim on the firm’s future income, that is the fruits of others’ labour <em>in perpetuity</em> (or until the firm dissolves, or they sell their shares etc.)</p>
<p>And the mere legal ownership of a firm is <em>sufficient</em> to lay claim on its profit. And, right here, is precisely the moment when the principle of exchange is violated. Once the firm repays its debt then the early investors are now made whole. Beyond this point, we have workers creating profits, and owners appropriating that profit without needing to contribute an hour of their time, or a dime from their pockets. The owners are getting something for nothing. The owners can, as John Stuart Mill put it: “grow richer, as it were in their sleep”. There’s no exchange. Just appropriation. And that is what’s commonly, and accurately, called economic exploitation.</p>
<p>The important point is this: equity capital violates the principle of exchange. </p>
<p>Sometimes the meaning of a social situation can suddenly flip. You notice something new, like an object in the wrong place, or a small inconsistency that points to a secret, or a lie. This is one of those occasions. There’s an enormous difference between <em>advancing</em> capital to a firm, and <em>owning</em> a firm. This vital distinction is conspicuously absent from all the upbeat, world-changing, and progressive chit-chat in the coffee shops, restaurants, offices and homes of Silicon Valley. So let’s pretend they might be listening, that all their chatter stops, just for a moment, and we whisper into each and every individual ear: <em>equity capital is theft</em>. </p>
<p>When you take profits, but contribute <em>nothing</em> to the output of a firm, other than holding a paper claim, you are stealing.</p>
<p>Yet this is how startups in Silicon Valley are organised. Cohort after cohort of “smart” groups of highly educated workers are quite happy to sign up to their own exploitation, and cede control over how they organise their working day, and what they produce. The most effective prison is the one you don’t realise you’re in.</p>
<p>But hold on. Look, we’ve woken the libertarian consciousness of Silicon Valley, and its rationality is strong and terrible: those that were whispered to have been stirred, and they reply, in unison: No-one forces workers to accept these terms, and the wage contract is voluntary, and therefore perfectly OK! Go away, annoying socialist, and stop spoiling our fun!</p>
<h2 id="silicon-valley-forcing-people-to-sell-their-labour">Silicon Valley: forcing people to sell their labour</h2>
<p>Do workers freely enter into the wage contract? Do founders, with great ideas, have the freedom to start new commercial ventures that aren’t based on theft? To answer, let’s first define non-exploitative social relations of production.</p>
<p>In principle, Silicon Valley startups could be incorporated as profit-sharing worker cooperatives. In this type of institution, all working members share the profit, which is democratically distributed. So if you join the co-op, you get a say, and you get profit shares. If you leave, you don’t anymore. The firm is collectively owned by its current working members.</p>
<p>Worker co-ops don’t hire in labour at a pre-agreed rental price. They do the opposite. They hire-in capital at a pre-agreed rental price (i.e., raise loan capital <em>not</em> equity capital). So capital, not labour, is merely another <em>ex ante</em> cost of production with no claim on the residual income of the firm.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In a democratic worker co-op, the principle of exchange is not violated, and no-one systematically exploits others and steals the value they (jointly) created. Clearly, this is a more lucrative deal for workers: profit-sharing is better than a wage. So why doesn’t this happen in the Valley? Why don’t lots of workers incorporate worker co-ops? </p>
<p>There are some carrots and a stick.</p>
<h3 id="the-carrot-join-us-join-us">The carrot: join us, join us!</h3>
<p>High-tech workers, especially those with in-demand skills, get more than wages, they get stock options.</p>
<p>A stock option bestows the right to purchase company shares at a (very low) predefined price. You have to work, normally for many years, before you can exercise that right. The aim is worker retention, and align incentives so workers are motivated to create profits “for the company”. Stock options, in a sense, automatically bestow the material benefits of trade unionism without the need to organise. Any worker is, of course, glad of this potential source of additional income.</p>
<p>But stock options, when exercised, are equity capital and confer (part) ownership of the firm: and, as we’ve seen, that fundamentally means participating in theft. Stock options, therefore, invite a section of the working class to join the elevated ranks of the capitalist class, and start exploiting others’ labour. (In practice, most stock options turn out worthless, since most new ventures fail. But it’s the hope that motivates).</p>
<p>In a small startup, as is common in Silicon Valley, it’s especially clear that the workers create all the added value. But the owner(s) appropriate it. So even the best educated minds start to notice. And this doesn’t seem entirely fair. So stock options function to muddy the waters, and paper over the inconvenient truth of exploitation.</p>
<p>So that’s one carrot, which pushes high-tech workers to sign-up to a capitalist firm. But there are more. If a group of workers decide to incorporate a new venture then, unless they are highly politically conscious and especially moral creatures, they will incorporate a capitalist firm, not a worker co-op. Why? Because you’ll definitely make more money by owning a firm, paying others wages, and keeping the profit to yourself.</p>
<p>Many startup founders in Silicon Valley know they’re ripping off the workers they employ. They might soothe their guilt by pointing out they offer stock options, or throw themselves into libertarianism, which conveniently coincides with their material interests. But it’s a fact that stock is normally heavily concentrated amongst a few early founders and venture capitalists. As time goes on, the founders contributions are eclipsed by the hired workers, and then it’s just exploitation all down the line. The company is bought-out, the founders get their initial advances and more, and therefore cash in, and make their millions. But, in almost all cases, they did not contribute to the creation of that value—they stole it from the workers they hired.</p>
<p>So the wage contract is sweetened by stock options. That works. But the contract is only voluntary if the workers have other options, if they have a choice. Do they?</p>
<h3 id="the-stick-reproduce-capitalism-or-wither-and-die">The stick: reproduce capitalism or wither and die</h3>
<p>But there are sticks too, which remove all choice, and prevent founders from incorporating worker co-operatives, even if they were sufficiently politically conscious to want to. </p>
<p>Silicon Valley is famous for its vibrant and extensive venture capital community. Plenty of capital swills around, continually searching, like Sauron’s great eye, for the latest hit company to fund, and therefore own and exploit the efforts and creativity of hundreds and thousands of workers.</p>
<p>Any venture capitalist, quite naturally, wants to maximise their returns. So, if faced with a choice between funding two companies, A and B, where A is a capitalist firm, and therefore offers equity in return for capital, whereas B is a worker co-op, and only offers interest repayments in return for capital, then the venture capitalist will always opt to fund A. No contest. Equity capital is strictly a better deal than loan capital. (And it’s not just more money, but also top-down dictatorial control of the company’s direction, and the working conditions and wage levels of employees. And being powerful is much more fun than being powerless. It’s great for the ego.)</p>
<p>Hence worker co-ops don’t get funded in Silicon Valley, and never will. So all those talented and creative workers, with good ideas for making things that people want, have no choice but to incorporate a capitalist firm, and begin sorting people into a class of owners, and a class of workers.</p>
<p>I witnessed an especially ugly example at an Silicon Valley business conference. An “Angel Investor” (someone who provides early seed capital) presented a talk about the criteria they apply when deciding which new ventures to invest in, and therefore what aspiring founders should do in order to maximise their chances of raising capital. A big factor, for the Angel, was that founders also raise money from friends and family, since “the desire to not disappoint loved ones is a great stimulant to hard work”. The Angel gave examples of “great stories” about teams they’d funded and the great returns made “by everybody”. At the close the Angel invited any founders in the audience to come and pitch their ideas to him—right there and then.</p>
<p>A line of about twenty or so young people formed in front of the Angel, desperate to get funding for their cherished ideas. And there it was, like a frozen scene from a perverted nativity: an anointed minority of one, with the monopoly on capital, and an unwashed majority, full of aspirations and creativity, lining up, cap-in-hand, to proffer the sacrifice of equity in their newborn, and surrender themselves to exploitation.</p>
<p>There was no choice, there is no choice: either submit to capital or watch your ideas wither and die. There are no other practical ways to raise significant capital. Real Angels don’t exist: those that ask only for their loan to be repaid, and not ownership of the firm; who reject the social relationship of equity capital, and therefore only invest in new ventures that incorporate as democratic worker-owned co-ops, so that all profit is shared, according to actual merit and contribution. If such fabled beings were present, the line before them would have been much, much longer.</p>
<p>There is no choice. Founders must incorporate capitalist firms, and must rent-in labour. And workers, who need income, don’t have the option to join a worker co-op. They must sign the wage contract. This isn’t voluntary, it’s coerced—by those with the monopoly on capital.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley culture celebrates venture capital, the Schumpeterian heroic entrepreneur, the dynamism of capitalism, and the gee-whiz technical and creative ideas of startup founders. But Silicon Valley repeatedly and continually reproduces exploitation, where some members of the firm own it, and others simply rent their labour to it. There’s zero innovation or disruption in this sphere. The Valley is a great engine, churning out new companies, day after day, which reproduce the division between an economic class that wins, and an economic class that loses.</p>

<p>Economic inequality has always been around. But notably, in the last 30 years or so, economic inequality, in the rich countries, has significantly increased. So we find people at the bottom struggling for food and shelter, while those at the top earn many years worth of the average salary while they sleep. The majority in the middle work hard yet lack savings, living their entire lives a few paychecks from destitution.</p>
<p>Things have got so bad that even mainstream discourse has shifted to reflect the new reality. We’re routinely told that millennials face low wages, poor quality jobs, high debt, and worse economic outcomes compared to their parents. People now accept that the political system is rigged by a rich elite who’ve captured the institutions of the nation state. And even the arch conservative world of academic economics talks about inequality. And that simply didn’t happen as recently as ten years ago.</p>
<p>Bourgeois thinkers struggle to explain the major cause of economic inequality, because to do requires thinking deeply about property relations and the issue of systematic exploitation. Instead, they prefer to think about unequal human capital endowments, taxation policies, interest and growth rates, the saving habits of workers, rising costs in child and health care, or the impact of automation. They’ll think about anything and everything except the actual reason for inequality.</p>
<p>Capitalist firms, in an important sense, are social machines, institutions that operate within the context of a market economy to “sort” individuals into different classes by means of the wage system. This sorting produces a very specific income and wealth distribution, which is peculiar to capitalism. Empirically, capitalist societies exhibit two distinct regimes: a lognormal distribution of wage income, and a Pareto distribution of profit income.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>In any dynamic society, with a continual reallocation of the division of labour as new skills are demanded and other skills are automated or changed, we should expect some level of wage inequality due to mismatches between supply and demand in the labour market. Also, some jobs are terrible and dangerous, and people should get more for risking more. And some people really do contribute more within the workplace, and its OK if they get additional awards from their peers, if only to make sure they stick around. And some people actually need more, perhaps due to illness or disabilities or additional domestic responsibilities. All this is fine.</p>
<p>But, empirically, we see more than wage inequality. We see two distinct regimes. We see a majority earning wages, at the bottom of the scale, and a minority taking profits, at the top of the scale. Capitalist societies produce extreme inequalities where the top 10% or so take a big and disproportionate slice of the social pie.</p>
<p>And the reason is obvious, for those willing to look: the major cause of economic inequality is the wage system itself. The more workers a capitalist exploits the more profit they make. The more profit they make the more workers they can exploit. And capitalists in the super-rich bracket enjoy positive feedback effects. They can hardly lose. The economic game is entirely rigged in their favour. And, in this elevated state, they fall asleep, wake up the next morning, having earned more than workers do in their entire lifetimes.</p>
<p>In fact, the inequality between capitalists far exceeds the inequality between workers. The super-rich become astronomically rich as we bounce along the power-law tail of the Pareto distribution. The astronomically rich capture ostensibly democratic institutions, a phenomenon that is particularly clear in the USA, so that even mild social reforms are off the table. We’ve seen a collection of post-war policies, that once mitigated economic inequality, ditched in the last thirty years or so. This is why things have got even worse. Economic exploitation has increased.</p>
<p>Extreme economic inequality causes untold misery. At the top we see excessive and wasteful hyper-consumption. At the bottom, countless everyday struggles to live a dignified life. All the social ills of Silicon Valley, many of which are hidden in plain sight, are suffered mostly by the poorly paid, those with the least money. But inequality affects everyone. Societies with high Gini coefficients do worse on almost all measures of social well-being.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t have to be this way. Let’s imagine an impossible event, just for the sake of illustrating a point. Imagine that all the people we whispered to—in the cafes, the offices and homes of Silicon Valley—actually listened, and decided, right there and then, to abolish exploitation, and resolved, with great determination, to only ever incorporate worker co-ops, and only lend capital, and never demand equity, then—with one decisive and unlikely step—Silicon Valley would actually begin to do good. Because it’s at this precise pivotal moment—the birth of a new productive unit—that a society’s social relations of production either get reproduced, or changed. For once you start to abolish the wage contract, and the renting of human beings, you start to abolish economic classes and extreme income inequality. Wealth would then start to be shared more equitably, and fairly, upon the principle of exchange, according to actual contributions to production, and not specious paper claims. The Pareto upper-regime would lose its material basis, would totter and fall, and therewith all the power that goes with it, the ability to capture and corrupt democracies and run them for the benefit of a privileged and undeserving few. The majority of the population would have more, enjoy more, and live better.</p>
<p>You know, perhaps some really gifted entrepreneurs could figure out a way to export this culture, and good social outcomes, to the rest of the world. </p>
<h2 id="silicon-valley-bullshit-progressivism">Silicon Valley: bullshit progressivism</h2>
<p>But sadly, as of today, that is a dream. And it’s not even a dream that’s widely shared. Silicon Valley does not see the connection between the kinds of firms it funds and creates, and the kinds of social ills that surround it.</p>
<p>But why single out Silicon Valley? What I’ve just described applies to capitalism in general.<br>
Silicon Valley deserves especial opprobrium because the contradiction between its self-image and its reality is particularly stark. Silicon Valley desperately, desperately wants to view itself, and be seen as, socially progressive, enlightened, cutting-edge and, yes, utopian.</p>
<p>But despite the explosion of ideas and firms, and the progressive rhetoric, the core propositions of capitalism are completely untouched, inviolate. The coupling of radical technical experimentation, with extreme conservation of capitalist property relations, has been a very successful recipe for the Valley’s elite.</p>
<p>But the very startups that want to “change the world for the better” immediately reproduce economic exploitation: they separate human beings into a class that must rent their labour, and a class that appropriates the fruits of that labour; a class that is disciplined and must do as they are told in the workplace, and a class that disciplines and commands without democratic control. Every time an optimistic and earnest group of workers, with some great ideas, incorporate a startup and issue equity, any progressive content of those ideas are irreparably harmed.</p>
<p>Yet this is the specific evil that Silicon Valley does: it funnels the progressive content of technical utopianism (the increase in the forces of production) into institutions that exploit workers on a global scale, and contribute to extreme economic inequality (the existing social relations of production). Silicon Valley helps produce the dystopia we live in. It doesn’t change the world for the better. It makes it worse, every single day.</p>
<p>The narcissistic self-image of Valley culture contributes to its political backwardness. Some workers celebrate a victory when corporate HR departments commit to diversity in the workplace, or promise to address the gender pay gap. But these are easy concessions for capitalism, softballs, and the owners of your firm will happily accommodate you. Just don’t ask for bottom-up democracy in the workplace, or profit-sharing. Try it. You’ll get a very different response.</p>
<p>But that’s what I do wish for. And I’m talking to you now, fellow workers of the Valley! If you really want to do no evil, to be good, disrupt the status quo and make the world a better place, then <em>don’t create a capitalist firm</em>: it’s a top-down dictatorship, where the dictators steal the money. There’s nothing progressive about this kind of social institution. Founding such a startup is deeply unethical, represents institutionalised theft, and is a prime cause of diverse social ills. </p>
<p>Instead, use your talents to create democratic worker-owned cooperatives, based on equality among its working members; or help think of creative ways to solve the political problem of capitalists’ monopoly on capital.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> Abolishing economic exploitation genuinely makes the world a better place. Reproducing it in your startup does not.</p>

<p>Or, at the very least, they can.</p>



<p>Recently I got a friend to finally join me on Signal. He asked something about whether or not Signal is truly secure and private, like if it was safe from US government surveillance. I told him: <em>“Well, it’s end-to-end encrypted, so they don’t know <strong>what</strong> we’re talking about, but they definitely know that we’re talking to each other.”</em></p>



<p>I said that because Signal uses our phone numbers as ID’s. So, Signal would know that Phone Number A is talking to Phone Number B, and if they can figure out that Phone Number A belongs to me, and Phone Number B belongs to my buddy (usually not too hard to figure out with some OSINT or the assistance of certain governments), then Signal would know that my buddy and I are talking, even if they don’t know what we’re talking about.</p>



<p>This is a limit of end-to-end encryption, which I’ve <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sanesecurityguy.com/articles/the-limits-of-end-to-end-encryption/" target="_blank">talked about before</a>. End-to-end encryption provides confidentiality of data, but not anonymity or protection from identifying metadata.</p>



<p>However, I was surprised when my friend got back to me saying that, no, Signal actually doesn’t know who’s talking to who because of this feature called “<a href="https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sealed Sender</a>“.</p>



<p><em>“Woah! Seriously?! Cool!”</em> I thought. But then I started reading how Sealed Sender actually works, according to none other than Signal themselves, and I found that this feature is very technically complex, and <strong>totally useless</strong>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ʕ ಠ ᴥಠ ʔ: Woah! Seriously?! Not cool!</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>One-way anonymity for two-way communications</h2>



<p>While Sealed Sender is pretty complicated under the hood, the result of it is one-way anonymity. That means that, when Phone Number A sends a message to Phone Number B, Signal won’t know that the message is coming from Phone Number A and will only know that the message is to be delivered to Phone Number B.</p>



<p>It does this in a way that’s very similar to snail mail without a return address: the letter inside the mail envelope might tell the recipient who the sender is, but the mail envelope itself tells the post office only who the recipient is so that it can be delivered to them. If the post office doesn’t or can’t open the envelope to read the letter itself, then they don’t know who the sender is. Later on, when the recipient wants to send a reply to the sender, they can do the same thing.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ: Hm, okay. This kind of sounds like it’s anonymous.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Well, yes, it sort of is, but only when there’s only one message to be sent. The problem comes up when multiple messages are being sent back-and-forth like this.</p>



<p>Sticking with the snail mail analogy, what happens when two pen pals keep sending mail to each other from their homes without including return addresses in their envelopes? The postal service might not know who exactly is sending each piece of mail but, over time, they would know that <strong>Address A in Lower Manhattan</strong>, New York, keeps on getting one-way mail from the post office in 3630 East Tremont Avenue, <strong>the Bronx</strong>, New York; and <strong>Address B in the Bronx</strong> keeps on getting one-way mail from the post office in 350 Canal Street, <strong>Lower Manhattan</strong>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ʕ´•ᴥ•`ʔ: Oh. Then the postal service would be pretty sure that whoever is living at Address A and Address B are talking to each other.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Exactly. That’s the limitation of one-way anonymity: <strong>it works only one way!</strong> Once you start doing two-way communications, with replies going back-and-forth, then one-way anonymity is useless.</p>



<h2>Two pieces of metadata</h2>



<p>With multiple messages being sent back-and-forth over time, and with Signal knowing <em>only the recipient phone number</em> of each message, it would be pretty hard for Signal to figure out who’s talking to who when their servers are getting thousands of messages every second from different senders, with each message being conveyed to thousands of different recipients. But, Signal doesn’t know <em>only the recipient phone number</em> of each message; they also know the IP address of each sender. And this is where the snail mail analogy fails, because IP addresses are <em>much more specific</em> than post offices.</p>



<p>Signal messages, as we all know, get sent over the internet, and the internet sends data around using IP addresses. Sealed Sender only protects the sender’s phone number; it does not protect the sender’s IP address. So, if you’re sending Signal messages to your super secret pen pal from your house, and you aren’t using a VPN or Tor, then Signal knows that the messages being sent to your pen pal’s phone number are coming from your house’s IP address (not a post office, your house).</p>



<p>Even if you are using some method of masking your real IP address, you still have to use <em>some</em> IP address in order to communicate on the internet, and Signal will see that <em>the same IP address keeps on sending messages to the same phone number</em>. That’s enough to easily figure out that all of these different messages meant for the recipient are coming from the same sender. Sure, maybe you’re using the IP address of a VPN server or Tor exit node that has other Signal users sending messages at the same time, but that’s extremely unlikely. More likely: Even when you use a VPN or Tor, Signal can easily tell that every Sealed Sender message you’re sending to your pen pal are coming from one person: you.</p>



<p>And if your pen pal replies, the reply will have his IP address on it (the same IP address Signal sent your messages to) and your phone number on it. And then, when you want to receive the reply, you have to connect to Signal’s servers using, again, your IP address (the same IP address you used to send your messages to your pen pal earlier). Just like that, with two messages, Signal figured out which phone number (yours) is talking to which other phone number (your pen pal’s). If they ever decide to try and figure out who own these two phone numbers, they could ask your telecoms, or simply search Facebook and Twitter.</p>



<p>You can’t avoid using IP addresses on the internet; they are a necessity on the internet. But you can use a VPN or Tor to mask your real IP address with a fake one that’s not tied to your identity. <strong>But you can’t do that with phone numbers.</strong> A phone number is either tied to your identity or it isn’t; there is no masking possible, unless you use a service like <a href="https://mysudo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MySudo</a> which <a href="https://mysudo.com/mysudo-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t available for most of us</a> (US and Canada only, as of this writing). If you’re fortunate enough to be able to buy a prepaid SIM without ID, then great, all you and your pen pal have to do is buy some SIM cards that aren’t tied to your identities. If buying a prepaid SIM without ID ain’t an option, then your phone number has to be tied to your identity, and Signal can use these unmasked phone numbers, in combination with masked or unmasked IP addresses, to figure out who’s talking to who, <em>despite Sealed Sender’s promises</em>, as long as there’s a two-way conversation going on.</p>



<p>Which brings up an interesting question: <strong>Why does Signal require phone numbers?</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p>ʕ´•ᴥ•`ʔ: Hey, that is an interesting question…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Signal works over the internet, and the internet requires IP (internet protocol) addresses in order to figure out where a message should go. But sending messages over the internet <strong>does not</strong> require phone numbers; that’s a requirement when using SMS or cellular calls or mobile data, <strong>but not for using the internet</strong>. And yet, the “privacy-protecting” Signal app requires you to use a phone number to send and receive messages…</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ʕ⚆ᴥ⚆ʔ: Hmmmm…</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>It’s always a two-way street</h2>



<p>It gets worse. I keep repeating this: <strong>two-way communication</strong>. Sealed Sender doesn’t work with <strong>two-way communication</strong>. But, I’ve kind of been lying. The truth is: <strong>Signal already knows which phone numbers have been talking to which, even with Sealed Sender and only one-way communication.</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p>ʕ ಠ ᴥಠ ʔ: What?!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do these check marks look familiar to you? (Forgive the pixelation.)</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1035" height="580" src="https://sanesecurityguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Delivery-Receipt.png" alt="" srcset="https://sanesecurityguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Delivery-Receipt.png 1035w, https://sanesecurityguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Delivery-Receipt-300x168.png 300w, https://sanesecurityguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Delivery-Receipt-768x430.png 768w, https://sanesecurityguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Delivery-Receipt-600x336.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1035px) 100vw, 1035px"></figure>



<blockquote>
<p>ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ: Hm, yeah. Aren’t they the check marks that show up for at least a second whenever I send a Signal message? This is what’s shown after the lone check mark, and before they both turn white to indicate that my message was read, right?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s right. The lone check mark indicates that your Signal message was sent to Signal’s servers, these two check marks above indicate that your Signal message has been delivered to the recipient, and the two white check marks indicate that the recipient has read your Signal message.</p>



<p>Now, the thing about the two check marks above is that your Signal app only shows them when your phone has received what’s called a “delivery receipt” from the recipient’s phone. Whenever your pen pal gets a message from you, their Signal app sends a delivery receipt from their phone, through Signal’s servers, to your phone. Their Signal app does this <em>automatically and instantly</em>, and neither of you can turn it off. You can turn off read receipts (the two white check marks) and typing indicators, but you can’t turn off the <em>very first reply</em>: delivery receipts.</p>



<p>The delivery receipt is – <em>ahem</em> – also “protected” using Sealed Sender, but what was it that I’ve been saying this whole time is wrong with Sealed Sender?</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ: It works only one-way…</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>ʕ&nbsp;&nbsp; • ᴥ • &nbsp;&nbsp;ʔ: It works only one-way…</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>ʕ&nbsp;&nbsp; º ᴥ º &nbsp;&nbsp;ʔ: …and the delivery receipt automatically makes it two-way.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Exactly. And you can’t turn it off. Go figure why.</p>



<h2>Some alternatives and a work in progress</h2>



<p>So if you can’t trust Signal, who can you trust? Well, if all you need is a private text-based communication channel that won’t falsely advertise their privacy guarantees to you, <a href="https://proton.me/mail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proton Mail</a> and <a href="https://tuta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tutanota</a> (now called Tuta) are pretty good. But if you want private voice-based communication, then that’s gonna’ be a problem. WhatsApp is even worse than Signal, Telegram is <a href="https://sanesecurityguy.com/articles/the-limits-of-end-to-end-encryption/#end-to-end-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even worse than WhatsApp</a>, Wire requires an email address to use it (another unnecessary requirement), and most of the rest can’t be trusted because they aren’t open-source.</p>



<p>You could use <a href="https://meet.jit.si/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jitsi</a> for voice communications, but you’d have to use a separate service for text communications. You could use <a href="https://matrix.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matrix</a> for both text and voice, but that’s a software and communication protocol, so you’d have to set up your own server running it. You could use <a href="https://element.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Element</a>, which runs Matrix servers, but you’d have to <a href="https://element.io/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trust Amazon and Cloudflare</a> with your metadata, making this a rather messy solution to a privacy problem.</p>



<p>What that leaves us with is a single service that is still a work in progress: <a href="https://simplex.chat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SimpleX</a>. It asks for no global identifiers like phone numbers or email addresses. It at least tries, unlike Signal, <em>to make sure that it doesn’t know who’s talking to who</em>. It does this with the use of proxies that you randomly send your messages through to get to your recipient (the <a href="https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq/blob/master/protocol/overview-tjr.md#technical-details" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical details</a> of which are too complicated to get into here). Of course it is <a href="https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-source</a> and end-to-end encrypted, otherwise I wouldn’t be mentioning it. It even goes so far as to <strong>allow you to use Tor</strong> with it, or any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SOCKS</a> proxy. It’s pretty cool, actually; the most technically amazing communications platform I’ve ever seen.</p>



<p>But, it ain’t perfect. It’s kinda’ slow, and messages sometimes don’t come in in the right order or don’t come in at all. Voice calls are… iffy, particularly when using Tor. It is still a young, developing project, though it has been making great strides in improving itself, including <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/SimpleXChat.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting a security audit</a>.</p>



<p>Time will tell how it turns out, but at least I can say one thing: we’ve got a viable alternative.</p>

    23 Nov, 2025

        </p>
    

    <p>a few days after <a href="https://jenn.site/my-dad-could-still-be-alive-but-hes-not/">dad died</a>, we found the love letters, hidden away among his things. one of them said, <em>i love dota and i love peaches, but i love you more. i will quit smoking and lose weight for you. the happiest days of my life are the ones that start with you across the breakfast table from me.</em></p>
<p>my parents were not a love match. at 27 and 26, they were embarrassingly old by the standards of their small chinese port town. all four of my grandparents exerted enormous pressure to force them together.</p>
<p>my father fulfilled the familial obligations heaped on his shoulders without complaint. he didn't get along with my mother, or my younger brother, but this wasn't too bad; he often worked away from us (for months and even years on end), mostly in china, more recently in redacted, another canadian city.</p>
<p>the physical distance between us for most of my life has made his passing easier for me to come to terms with. i call him dad here but i didn't lose a dad, i lost someone who was abstractly a father to me. he was more often gone than there, had missed all of my graduations and birthday parties. there was one time he took care of me when i was sick. his hands on me were gentle, and he told me stories from chinese history while i lay feverish in bed. i was seven. this is approximately the only memory i have of him being a dad to me.</p>
<p>still, the two of us were close in our own way. sometimes, the two of us would go on long walks together. after fifteen minutes of silence, or twenty, something would loosen in him and he would start to tell me about the depths of his sadness and the disappointment in the way his life played out. i was good at not taking this personally. i didn't think he ever had a chance to be happy or authentic, his entire life. he sacrificed himself so i could.</p>
<p>i always thought that if he had a chance at happiness, he would be the gentle, funny, and sensitive aesthete that i caught glimpses of sometimes, instead of the bullheaded chinese patriarch others seemed to demand.</p>
<p>except it turns out he did have this chance after all. his lover and i ended up meeting soon after his death. edward lived in redacted, the city that my dad had worked in for the past year and a bit.</p>
<p>edward tells me their story, all in a rush. he and my dad had been seeing each other for three years, and had agreed to go exclusive a year and a half ago. they met while he was in china, and there was an instant spark between them, something special and precious that neither of them had felt before. dad convinced him to apply for a university program here in canada, to eventually get permanent residency in canada. so edward, in his 30s, sold his flourishing business and his house, and came to start over in a foreign land for the sake of being with him.</p>
<p>edward reckons they were engaged, or something like it; they lived together, toured open houses in redacted every weekend with every intent to buy something together, and there was an understanding that dad would soon come out, divorce my mother, and live in the open with edward for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>edward gave me some photos he had of my dad, and i could scarcely believe that they were of the grim, sad man i knew. he beams in all of them, glowing with joy, his smile more incandescent than i've ever seen in my entire life. i steal glances at edward, the person who took all those impossible photos. the person he was looking at.</p>
<p>my mind keeps stuttering to boskovitch's installation, that single box fan behind plexiglass. i imagine the course of events from edward's point of view: a year living with the love of your life, and then they are suddenly gone in an awful accident and you are too late to see them one last time, to attend the funeral. your own grief is an isolating thing because you are closeted and no one else knew who you were to each other. i wish we had gotten in touch sooner, but edward is grateful to be allowed any affordance, at all.</p>
<p>their life in redacted seemed similarly impossible: a life where my dad splurged on the treats he never did at home (hagen dazs ice cream, honeycrisp apples, nice shoes) and left the house on a regular basis to explore the city with the one he loves. a life where he felt safe enough to ask for kisses and cuddles because he knew they would be provided, even to <em>sa jiao</em> playfully. all i ever knew him to do at home was to sit in a stupor by the television set.</p>
<p>and there was a new hurt, but it was sweet, to imagine the way life could have been in ten years time, a life i've never previously imagined; dad happily with edward in a nice new house where i'd visit every so often, shoulders loose and smiling, and we'd get to talk, <em>actually</em> talk.</p>
<p>according to edward, my dad had known that he had liked men at least since his university years. that makes it almost forty years in the closet, then; just thinking about it makes me feel a sort of dizzying claustrophobia.</p>
<p>i came out to mom years before i came out to dad. when i did, mom told me that coming out to dad was not a good idea, because he was such a traditionalist and she didn't know how he would react. but i came out to him anyways, one quiet afternoon when i visited him in china, because i thought our relationship was good and that he can handle it, and i wanted him to know this about me.</p>
<p>when i did, he took it well. he told me that though the path i am on is a painful one, he would be there for me, and that the most important thing was to find <em>xin fu</em> in life, not to live your life in accordance to the expectations of anyone else. in my staggering relief i did not notice the confusion. i just felt so grateful to have had that understanding, a precious gift that i did not have any expectation of receiving. now, i feel only bereft of the conversations we never managed to have, and grief for the life he never got to live.</p>
<p>dad lives in my living room these days, in a box made of cherry wood, because mom didn't want him in the house after the truth came out. so when edward visited, he got to see him one last time, and say goodbye. he held the box in his arms and wept, spilling more tears and emotions than his biological family managed to, and i escaped to my room for the evening to give them some privacy.</p>
<p>did i mention the shrines? we set them up for the dead in our culture. we had ours, a formal thing in a cabinet, and we had knelt in front of it like we were supposed to, given the correct number of kowtows. edward shared with me pictures of his. it sprawled over the entirety of his dining table. it had packs of playing cards from the brand he liked best and his favourite cuts of meat and the wine he finished off the day with. every morning, he would play my dad's favourite songs to him. i didn't know my dad's favourite cuts of meat. i didn't know he drank wine. i didn't know he listened to music.</p>
<p>so of course i let them say goodbye to each other. when i went out of my room the next morning, he was still fully dressed on my couch, bedding untouched, staring blankly at the box in his lap. it gleamed red in the morning sun. he rose at my approach, put my dad back on the mantle with gentle hands, and then stood quietly at a perfect parade rest in front of him as i managed breakfast for the two of us. his flight back to redacted was that afternoon.</p>
<p>i don't know how to thank you for all this, he says. the chance to say goodbye. he was really proud of you, he spoke about you to me all the time. he never told me that you were gay. edward tells me that dad had plans to go back to redacted in a few weeks time and that he wanted to tell me everything before he left, but he was anxious about how i'd take it. i don't ask edward how many times he'd made the resolution to tell me before.</p>
<p>because you see, my dad was a coward. mom had started asking for divorces by the time i was in my teens, and dad was the one who always said no. he would complain to <em>her</em> mother, a traditionalist, to ensure that she would berate her daughter back into line. his family and his culture had no place for him, so he used her as a shield to make sure that he would be spared the scrutiny. slowly, we found evidence of other affairs, going back decades. of course my mother did not want him in the house.</p>
<p>i sit by my dad sometimes, and i make sure he always has a bowl of fresh fruit. fifty seven years, most of them suffocating and miserable, the last three of them shot through with so much joy his smile absolutely glows.</p>
<div><p><em>he wasted his entire life</em>, my mom said to me, the evening we found the love letters. <em>his entire life, and mine as well.</em></p><p>

<p>Three years ago, Google removed JPEG XL support from Chrome, stating there wasn’t enough interest at the time. That position has now changed.</p>



<p>In a recent note to developers, a Chrome team representative <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/WjCKcBw219k/m/NmOyvMCCBAAJ">confirmed </a>that work has restarted to bring JPEG XL to Chromium and said Google “would ship it in Chrome” once long-term maintenance and the usual launch requirements are met.</p>



<p>The team explained that other platforms moved ahead. Safari supports JPEG XL, and Windows 11 users can add native support through an image extension from Microsoft Store. The format is also confirmed for use in PDF documents. There has been continuous demand from developers and users who ask for its return.</p>



<p>Before Google ships the feature in Chrome, the company wants the integration to be secure and supported over time.</p>



<h2 id="h-chrome-jpeg-xl-implementation-adds-animation-support">Chrome JPEG XL implementation adds animation support</h2>



<p>A developer has submitted new code that reintroduces JPEG XL to Chromium. This version is marked as feature complete. The developer <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/WjCKcBw219k/m/NeiCV32tBAAJ">said</a> it also “includes animation support,” which earlier implementations did not offer. The code passes most of Chrome’s automated testing, but it remains under review and is not available to users.</p>



<p>The featured image is taken from an unlisted developer demo created for testing purposes.</p>



<p>JPEG XL is a newer image format intended as a replacement for traditional JPEG files. It can reduce file size without loss in visual quality. This may help web pages load faster and reduce data usage.  More details are available on the <a href="https://jpegxl.info/">official JPEG XL website</a>.</p>



<p>Google has not provided a timeline for JPEG XL support in Chrome. Users cannot enable the format today, but development has restarted after years without progress.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-3467012800646079318" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>I've been studying the standard cell circuitry in the Intel 386 processor recently.
The 386, introduced in 1985, was Intel's most complex processor at the time, containing 285,000 transistors.
Intel's existing design techniques couldn't handle this complexity and the chip began to fall behind schedule.
To meet the schedule, the 386 team started using a technique called standard cell logic.
Instead of laying out each transistor manually, the layout process was performed by a computer.</p>
<p>The idea behind standard cell logic is to create standardized circuits (standard cells) for each type of logic element, such
as an inverter, NAND gate, or latch.
You feed your circuit description into software that selects the necessary cells, 
positions these cells into columns, and then routes the wiring between the cells.
This "automatic place and route" process creates the chip layout much faster than manual layout.
However, switching to standard cells was a risky decision since if the software couldn't create a
dense enough layout, the chip couldn't be manufactured.
But in the end, the 386 finished ahead of schedule, an almost unheard-of accomplishment.<span id="fnref:oral-history"><a href="#fn:oral-history">1</a></span></p>
<p>The 386's standard cell circuitry contains a few circuits that I didn't expect.
In this blog post, I'll take a quick look at some of these circuits:
surprisingly large multiplexers, a transistor that doesn't fit into the standard cell layout,
and inverters that turned out not to be inverters.
(If you want more background on standard cells in the 386, see my earlier post,
"<a href="https://www.righto.com/2024/01/intel-386-standard-cells.html">Reverse engineering standard cell logic in the Intel 386 processor</a>".)</p>
<p>The photo below shows the 386 die with the automatic-place-and-route regions highlighted; I'm focusing
on the red region in the lower right.
These blocks of logic have cells arranged in rows, giving them a characteristic striped appearance.
The dark stripes are the transistors that make up the logic gates, while the lighter regions between the stripes are the
"routing channels" that hold the wiring that connects the cells.
In comparison,
functional blocks
such as the datapath on the left
and the microcode ROM in the lower right
were designed manually to optimize density and performance, giving them a more solid appearance.</p>

<p>As for other features on the chip,
the black circles around the border are bond wire connections that go to the chip's external pins.
The chip has two metal layers, a small number by modern
standards, but a jump from the single metal layer of earlier processors such as the 286.
(Providing two layers of metal made automated routing practical: one layer can hold horizontal wires while the other layer
can hold vertical wires.)
The metal appears white in larger areas, but
purplish where circuitry underneath roughens its surface.
The underlying silicon and the polysilicon wiring are obscured by the metal layers.</p>
<h2>The giant multiplexers</h2>
<p>The standard cell circuitry that I'm examining (red box above) is part of the control logic that selects registers
while executing an instruction.
You might think that it is easy to select which registers take part in an instruction, but
due to the complexity of the x86 architecture, it is more difficult.
One problem is that a 32-bit register such as EAX can also be treated as the 16-bit register AX,
or two 8-bit registers AH and AL.
A second problem is that some instructions include a "direction" bit that switches the source and
destination registers.
Moreover, sometimes the register is specified by bits in the instruction, but in other cases,
the register is specified by the microcode.
Due to these factors, selecting the registers for an operation is a complicated process with many
cases, using control bits from the instruction, from the microcode, and from other sources.</p>
<p>Three registers need to be selected for an operation—two source registers and a destination register—and there
are about 17 cases that need to be handled.
Registers are specified with 7-bit control signals that select one of the 30 registers and control
which part of the register is accessed.
With three control signals, each 7 bits wide, and about 17 cases for each, you can see that
the register control logic is large and complicated.
(I wrote more about the 386's registers <a href="https://www.righto.com/2025/05/intel-386-register-circuitry.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p>I'm still reverse engineering the register control logic, so I won't go into details.
Instead, I'll discuss how the register control circuit uses multiplexers, implemented with standard cells.
A multiplexer is a circuit that combines multiple
input signals into a single output by selecting one of the inputs.<span id="fnref:one-hot"><a href="#fn:one-hot">2</a></span>
A multiplexer can be implemented with logic gates, for instance, by ANDing each input with the
corresponding control line, and then ORing the results together.
However, the 386 uses a different approach—CMOS switches—that avoids a large AND/OR gate.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/cmos-switch.jpg"><img alt="Schematic of a CMOS switch." height="169" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/cmos-switch-w200.jpg" title="Schematic of a CMOS switch." width="200"></a></p><p>Schematic of a CMOS switch.</p>
<p>The schematic above shows how a CMOS switch is constructed from two MOS transistors.
When the two transistors are on, the output is connected to the input, but when the two transistors are
off, the output is isolated.
An NMOS transistor is turned on when its input is high, but a PMOS transistor is turned on when its
input is <em>low</em>. Thus, the switch uses two control inputs, one inverted.
The motivation for using two transistors is that an NMOS transistor is better at pulling the output
low, while a PMOS transistor is better at pulling the output high, so combining them yields the best performance.<span id="fnref:6502"><a href="#fn:6502">3</a></span>
Unlike a logic gate, the CMOS switch has no amplification, so a signal is weakened as it passes through the switch.
As will be seen below, inverters can be used to amplify the signal.</p>
<p>The image below shows how CMOS switches appear under the microscope.
This image is very hard to interpret because the two layers of metal on the 386 are packed together densely, but you
can see that some wires run horizontally and others run vertically.
The bottom layer of metal (called M1) runs vertically in the routing area, as well as providing internal
wiring for a cell.
The top layer of metal (M2) runs horizontally; unlike M1, the M2 wires can cross a cell.
The large circles are vias that connect the M1 and M2 layers, while the small circles are connections
between M1 and polysilicon or M1 and silicon.
The central third of the image is a column of standard cells with two CMOS switches outlined in green.
The cells are bordered by the vertical ground rail and
+5V rail that power the cells. 
The routing areas are on either side of the cells, holding the wiring that connects the cells.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/switch-metal.jpg"><img alt="Two CMOS switches, highlighted in green. The lower switch is flipped vertically compared to the upper switch." height="465" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/switch-metal-w400.jpg" title="Two CMOS switches, highlighted in green. The lower switch is flipped vertically compared to the upper switch." width="400"></a></p><p>Two CMOS switches, highlighted in green. The lower switch is flipped vertically compared to the upper switch.</p>
<p>Removing the metal layers reveals the underlying silicon with a layer of polysilicon wiring on top.
The doped silicon regions show up as dark outlines.
I've drawn the polysilicon in green; it forms a transistor (brighter green) when it crosses doped silicon.
The metal ground and power lines are shown in blue and red, respectively, with other metal wiring in purple.
The black dots are vias between layers.
Note how metal wiring (purple) and polysilicon wiring (green) are combined to route signals within
the cell.
Although this standard cell is complicated, the important thing is that it only needs to be designed once.
The standard cells for different functions are all designed to have the same width, so the cells can be arranged in
columns, snapped together like Lego bricks.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/switch-diagram.jpg"><img alt="A diagram showing the silicon for a standard-cell switch. The polysilicon is shown in green. The bottom metal is shown in blue, red, and purple." height="289" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/switch-diagram-w400.jpg" title="A diagram showing the silicon for a standard-cell switch.

The polysilicon is shown in green. The bottom metal is shown in blue, red, and purple.</p>
<p>To summarize, this switch circuit allows the input to be connected to the output or disconnected, controlled by the select signal.
This switch is more complicated than the earlier schematic because it includes two inverters to amplify
the signal.
The data input and the two select lines are connected to the polysilicon (green); the cell is designed so
these connections can be made on either side.
At the top, the input goes through a standard two-transistor inverter.
The lower left has two transistors, combining the NMOS half of an inverter with the NMOS half of the switch.
A similar circuit on the right combines the PMOS part of an inverter and switch.
However, because PMOS transistors are weaker, this part of the circuit is duplicated.</p>
<p>A multiplexer is constructed by combining multiple switches, one for each input.
Turning on one switch will select the corresponding input.
For instance, a four-to-one multiplexer has four switches, so it can select one of the four inputs.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/mux4.jpg"><img alt="A four-way multiplexer constructed from CMOS switches and individual transistors." height="430" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/mux4-w200.jpg" title="A four-way multiplexer constructed from CMOS switches and individual transistors." width="200"></a></p><p>A four-way multiplexer constructed from CMOS switches and individual transistors.</p>
<p>The schematic above shows a hypothetical multiplexer with four inputs.
One optimization is that if an input is always 0, the PMOS transistor can be omitted. Likewise,
if an input is always 1, the NMOS transistor can be omitted.
One set of select lines is activated at a time to select the corresponding input.
The pink circuit selects 1,
green selects input A, yellow selects input B, and blue selects 0.
The multiplexers in the 386 are similar, but have more inputs.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows how much circuitry is devoted to multiplexers in this block of standard cells.
The green, purple, and red cells correspond to the multiplexers driving the three register control
outputs.
The yellow cells are inverters that generate the inverted control signals for the CMOS switches.
This diagram also shows how the automatic layout of cells results in a layout that appears random.</p>

<h2>The misplaced transistor</h2>
<p>The idea of standard-cell logic is that standardized cells are arranged in columns.
The space between the cells is the "routing channel", holding the wiring that links the cells.
The 386 circuitry follows this layout, except for one single transistor, sitting between two columns
of cells.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/extra-transistor.jpg"><img alt="The &quot;misplaced&quot; transistor, indicated by the arrow. The irregular green regions are oxide that was incompletely removed." height="433" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/extra-transistor-w500.jpg" title="The &quot;misplaced&quot; transistor, indicated by the arrow. The irregular green regions are oxide that was incompletely removed." width="500"></a></p><p>The "misplaced" transistor, indicated by the arrow. The irregular green regions are oxide that was incompletely removed.</p>
<p>I wrote some software tools to help me analyze the standard cells. Unfortunately, my tools
assumed that all the cells were in columns, so this one wayward transistor caused me considerable inconvenience.</p>
<p>The transistor turns out to be a PMOS transistor, pulling a signal high as part of a multiplexer.
But why is this transistor out of place?
My hypothesis is that the transistor is a bug fix.
Regenerating the cell layout was very costly, taking many hours on an IBM mainframe computer.
Presumably, someone found that they could just stick the necessary transistor into an unused spot in the
routing channel, manually add the necessary wiring, and avoid the delay of regenerating all the cells.</p>
<h2>The fake inverter</h2>
<p>The simplest CMOS gate is the inverter, with an NMOS transistor to pull the output low and a
PMOS transistor to pull the output high.
The standard cell circuitry that I examined contains over a hundred inverters of various
sizes.
(Performance is improved by using inverters that aren't too small but also aren't
larger than necessary for a particular circuit. Thus, the standard cell library includes inverters of multiple sizes.)</p>
<p>The image below shows a medium-sized standard-cell inverter under the microscope.
For this image, I removed the two metal layers with acid to show the underlying polysilicon
(bright green) and silicon (gray).
The quality of this image is
poor—it is difficult to remove the metal without destroying the polysilicon—but the diagram below
should clarify the circuit.
The inverter has two transistors: a PMOS transistor connected to +5 volts to pull the output high when
the input is 0, and an NMOS transistor connected to ground to pull the output low when the input is 1.
(The PMOS transistor needs to be larger because PMOS transistors don't function as well as NMOS transistors due to
silicon physics.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/inverter-diagram.jpg"><img alt="An inverter as seen on the die. The corresponding standard cell is shown below." height="347" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/inverter-diagram-w450.jpg" title="An inverter as seen on the die. The corresponding standard cell is shown below." width="450"></a></p><p>An inverter as seen on the die. The corresponding standard cell is shown below.</p>
<p>The polysilicon input line plays a key role: where it crosses the doped silicon, a transistor gate is
formed.
To make the standard cell more flexible, the input to the inverter
can be connected on either the left or the right; in this case, the input
is connected on the right and there is no connection on the left.
The inverter's output can be taken from the polysilicon on the upper left or the right, but in this case, it
is taken from the upper metal layer (not shown).
The power, ground, and output lines are in the lower metal layer, which I have represented by
the thin red, blue, and yellow lines. The black circles are connections between the metal layer and
the underlying silicon.</p>
<p>This inverter appears dozens of times in the circuitry.
However, I came across a few inverters that didn't make sense. The problem was
that the inverter's output was connected to the output of a multiplexer.
Since an inverter is either on or off, its value would clobber the output of the multiplexer.<span id="fnref:latch"><a href="#fn:latch">4</a></span>
This didn't make any sense.
I double- and triple-checked the wiring to make sure I hadn't messed up.
After more investigation, I found another problem: the input to a "bad" inverter didn't make sense
either. The input consisted of two signals shorted together, which doesn't work.</p>
<p>Finally, I realized what was going on. A "bad inverter" has the exact silicon layout of an inverter,
but it wasn't an inverter: it was independent NMOS and PMOS transistors with separate inputs.
Now it all made sense.
With two inputs, the input signals were independent, not shorted together.
And since the transistors were controlled separately, the NMOS transistor could pull the output
low in some circumstances, the PMOS transistor could pull the output high in other circumstances,
or both transistors could be off, allowing the multiplexer's output to be used undisturbed.
In other words, the "inverter" was just two more cases for the multiplexer.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/transistors-die.jpg"><img alt="The &quot;bad&quot; inverter. (Image is flipped vertically for comparison with the previous inverter.)" height="177" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/transistors-die-w450.jpg" title="The &quot;bad&quot; inverter. (Image is flipped vertically for comparison with the previous inverter.)" width="450"></a></p><p>The "bad" inverter. (Image is flipped vertically for comparison with the previous inverter.)</p>
<p>If you compare the "bad inverter" cell below with the previous cell, they look <em>almost</em> the same, but
there are subtle differences.
First, the gates of the two transistors are connected in the real inverter, but disconnected
by a small gap in the transistor pair.
I've indicated this gap in the photo above; it is hard to tell if the gap is real or just an imaging
artifact, so I didn't spot it.
The second difference is that the "fake" inverter has two input connections, one to each transistor,
while the inverter has a single input connection.
Unfortunately, I assumed that the two connections were just a trick to route the signal across
the inverter without requiring an extra wire.
In total, this cell was used 32 times as a real inverter and 9 times
as independent transistors.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Standard cell logic and automatic place and route have a long history before the 386,
back to the early 1970s, so this isn't an Intel invention.<span id="fnref:standard-cell-history"><a href="#fn:standard-cell-history">5</a></span>
Nonetheless, the 386 team deserves the credit for deciding to use this technology at a time when it
was a risky decision.
They needed to develop custom software for their placing and routing needs, so this wasn't a trivial undertaking.
This choice paid off and they completed the 386 ahead of schedule.
The 386 ended up being a huge success for Intel, moving the x86 architecture to 32 bits and defining the dominant computer
architecture for the rest of the 20th century.</p>

It also separates static presentation (the template) from dynamic data (tool results), enabling better caching.</p><h4 id="mcp-transport-for-communication">MCP transport for communication</h4><p>Instead of inventing a custom message protocol, UI components communicate with hosts using existing MCP JSON-RPC base protocol over <code>postMessage</code>.

The proposal addresses this through multiple layers:</p><ol><li><strong>Iframe sandboxing</strong>: All UI content runs in sandboxed iframes with restricted permissions</li><li><strong>Predeclared templates</strong>: Hosts can review HTML content before rendering</li><li><strong>Auditable messages</strong>: All UI-to-host communication goes through loggable JSON-RPC</li><li><strong>User consent</strong>: Hosts can require explicit approval for UI-initiated tool calls</li></ol><p>These mitigations create defense in depth against malicious servers while preserving the flexibility developers need.</p><h4 id="backward-compatibility">Backward compatibility</h4><p>MCP Apps is an optional extension. Existing implementations continue working without changes, and hosts can gradually adopt UI support at their own pace. Servers should provide text-only fallback for all UI-enabled tools and return meaningful content even when UI is unavailable, so they can serve both UI-capable and text-only hosts.</p><h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2><p>The <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol-community/working-groups/issues/35">UI Community Working Group</a> has been instrumental in shaping this proposal through extensive feedback and discussion.

<!--beginarticle-->
<pre>The GCC Steering Committee has agreed to include the Algol 68 Front End in
trunk designated as experimental with stipulations:

1. Algol 68 is not part of all languages built by default.
2. Algol 68 is not part of the GCC release criteria.
3. All GCC developers who are not responsible for the Algol 68 Front End
may decline to work on issues related to the Algol 68 Front End.
4. If the Algol 68 Front End bit rots or is not maintained, it will be
removed.

To permit Algol 68 development to continue, Jose E. Marchesi is appointed
as Algol 68 front end maintainer.

If maintaining a Front End outside of trunk is difficult, the Algol 68
developers are invited to propose concrete changes to make it easier to
maintain front ends in a branch of the GCC repository outside of trunk.

Happy Hacking!
David

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Germany plans to treat the use of date rape drugs like the use of weapons in prosecutions as part of measures to ensure justice for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.</p><p>“We classify date rape drugs, which are increasingly used as a widespread tool in crimes, as weapons. This creates the basis for significantly stricter prosecutions,” Alexander Dobrindt, the interior minister, said on Friday. “We are committed to clear consequences and consistent enforcement. Women should feel safe and be able to move freely everywhere.”</p><p>Nearly 54,000 women and girls were the victims of sexual offences in Germany in 2024 – an increase of 2.1% on the previous year – of which nearly 36% were victims of rape and sexual assault.</p><p>A parliamentary debate over a bill calling for a mandatory minimum five-year prison sentence for the use of date rape drugs in sexual assaults was postponed last month.</p><p>Police last year registered a record high of almost 266,000 domestic violence victims, a 3.8% increase on the previous year. However, there were a high number of unreported cases, the head of the federal criminal police office, Holger Münch, said.</p><p>“We must work to ensure that more victims find the courage to report crimes in order to improve the protection and support for victims,” he added.</p><p>Although there is no uniform federal definition for femicide in Germany, nearly 1,200 women and girls were recorded as victims of homicide or attempted homicide in 2024, a slight decrease year on year.</p><p>The German government this week approved a draft law allowing the use of electronic ankle monitors to track perpetrators of domestic violence. Victims can also request a separate device to warn them when the perpetrator is nearby.</p><p>Dobrindt said the government had also secured funding for the national rollout of an app allowing domestic abuse victims to secretly document abuse incidents to be used later in court.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Multiple times. They blamed my WiFi (I’m hardwired). They blamed my modem (an Xfinity Approved MB8611 that worked without fault on Wave Broadband and Spectrum). They blamed my router (I tested with multiple devices). They sent a subcontracted technician. Then another subcontracted technician. Then a subcontracted crew. The crew ran a new coax line and grounded it to a water pipe that turns into PVC when it enters the ground (this doesn’t ground anything). Then they sent an Xfinity technician to look at the line.</p><p>The problem never changed. The only thing that changed is my download speed dropped from advertised 1200Mbps to &lt;500Mbps.</p><div id="mai-gallery-3"><figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/sacbear.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-3.png?fit=300%2C242&amp;ssl=1" data-gallery="mai-gallery-3" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/sacbear.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-3.png?resize=300%2C242&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/sacbear.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-3.png?resize=768%2C621&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/sacbear.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-3.png?resize=1024%2C827&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/sacbear.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-3.png?w=1380&amp;ssl=1 1380w" data-glightbox="description:For my trouble of reporting a network outage I lost 700Mbps in speed.

This is a 1200Mbps plan.</figcaption></figure></div><p>I escalated to retention. They offered me nothing. I provided detailed technical documentation showing the exact pattern of the outages, the minute markers they occur at, the exact duration every single time. They didn’t understand it. They couldn’t escalate it.</p><p>I was transferred to technical support. The person did not care and put me on speaker phone with so much background noise I couldn’t hear myself think. I imagine he was rolling his eyes while trying his utmost to care less.</p><h2><strong>My Neighbor’s Attempts to Fix It</strong></h2><p>He called Xfinity about his TV cutting out repeatedly. The technician told him his UPS grounding his coax cable was causing the problem. So he ungrounded the cable, pocketed the spare cable, and my neighbor kept having the same issues.</p><h2><strong>What I Found</strong></h2><p>Just in the last 72 hours I have documented 20 consecutive outages using OPNSense’s built in gateway uptime monitor. Here’s what they show:</p><p><strong>Every single outage lasted 124.8 ± 1.3 seconds.</strong> That’s not random hardware failure. That’s a timeout value hardcoded into something in Xfinity’s infrastructure.</p><p><strong>The outages cluster at specific minute markers.</strong> 35% start at minute :44. 35% start at minute :29. This is scheduled automation. This is likely a cron job or automated task running at those exact times every hour.</p><p><strong>The outages peak at specific hours.</strong> Most happen between noon and 1 PM. Others cluster in early morning around 2-3 AM. This is not random.</p><p>This is an infrastructure problem on Xfinity’s network. Not on my end. Not on my neighbor’s end. Upstream. Somewhere on their equipment something is failing for exactly 125 seconds multiple times per day.</p><p>I have the data. I have the patterns. I have another customer (my neighbor) on a different line experiencing the exact same thing.</p><p>Xfinity has all this information. They know about the problem. They just won’t investigate it.</p><h2><strong>Why They Won’t Fix It</strong></h2><ol><li><strong>Support can’t understand technical data.</strong> They follow scripts. When I attempted to explain monitoring logs they had no framework for discussing it. They blamed my equipment because that’s what they’re trained to do.</li><li><strong>Nobody has authority to escalate.</strong> Retention transferred me to tech support. Tech support couldn’t care nor help. They dug up my yard and placed a new line which did nothing to solve the problem. Nobody would actually order an investigation into the upstream infrastructure.</li><li><strong>There’s no pressure to fix it.</strong> Xfinity is the only gigabit provider in this area. No competition. No alternatives. I can’t leave. So they don’t have to care.</li><li><strong>A 2-minute outage every few hours is “tolerable.”</strong> It’s annoying enough to frustrate customers but not enough to make them quit (since they have nowhere else to go). It’s cheap to ignore compared to actually investigating and fixing it.</li></ol><p><strong>There’s Also a Security Problem</strong></p><p>About half of the Xfinity junction boxes in my neighborhood are unlocked or broken. Anyone can walk up and disconnect whomever they want.</p><p>If your home security system is on Xfinity with no wireless backup, someone can just walk to the street and physically disconnect your internet, rob your house, and your security system won’t notify you.</p><h2><strong>I’m Out of Options</strong></h2><p>I’ve done everything I can do as a customer:</p><ul><li>Documented the problem professionally</li><li>Escalated through all available channels</li><li>Provided technical evidence</li><li>Been ignored at every level</li></ul><p>The problem is real. My neighbor confirms it. Everyone downstream of whatever is broken on their infrastructure probably has it too.</p><p>I can’t fix this. Only Xfinity can. And they won’t.</p><p>So I’m publishing this hoping someone with actual authority, perhaps someone at a regulatory agency, someone at a news outlet, someone who has power over Xfinity sees this and decides to actually investigate.</p><p>Because I’m out of options. My neighbors are out of options. And Xfinity’s counting on us staying out of options. Because this is the reality of my neighborhood (<a href="https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/location-summary/fixed" data-type="link" data-id="https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/location-summary/fixed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">source</a>):</p><div id="mai-gallery-5"><figure><img data-lazyloaded="1" data-placeholder-resp="800x679" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" decoding="async" width="800" height="679" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/sacbear.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image.png?fit=800%2C679&amp;ssl=1" alt="" title="Broadband Availability" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/sacbear.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image.png?resize=300%2C255&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/sacbear.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image.png?resize=768%2C652&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/sacbear.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image.png?w=816&amp;ssl=1 816w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>As you can, see there is zero choice.</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>If you’re in Sacramento County and have Xfinity internet, check two things:</em></p><p><em>1.
