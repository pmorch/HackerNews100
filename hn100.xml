Companies see their idiot friends creating AI and they want a piece of that hype hype yum yum so they do it too. For example:</p><p><span>Here’s </span><a href="https://www.inc.com/sam-blum/ai-boom-full-copycats-trying-ride-viral-trend-thats-not-bad-business.html" rel="">some article about it</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Jason Corsello, CEO and general partner of Acadian Ventures, a venture firm focused on the future of work startups, explained that A.I. remains tantalizing for investors, even amid the </span><a href="https://www.inc.com/sam-blum/the-vc-market-has-never-been-worse-that-doesnt-mean-you-cant-get-startup-funding.html" rel="">historic downturn</a><span>. That may not be a good thing for startups, he cautions. "This area of A.I. is somewhat overhyped. It's over-invested, it's overvalued. When you're seeing seed-stage companies raise between $100 million and $150 million with nothing more than a pitch deck, that's a bit concerning."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But the froth isn't unfamiliar. The A.I. boom, and the crush of startups now competing for success, could be a product of </span><strong>copycat logic</strong><span>. </span><strong>As money is pumped into new firms, nobody wants to be left out</strong><span>, Oded Shenkar, a professor of management and human resources at Ohio State University, explains. "It's a common error to think of startups always as innovators," he says, "when you have a gold rush, of course, you're going to have more imitation."</span></p></blockquote><p>Ah ok great so basically all the companies are playing copycat with Daddy Andreesen's Money Slush until something dumb happens and one of them gets super rich? </p><p>Cool. </p><p>Meanwhile, the people must endure

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>YC seems like a reasonable proposition. They give you some money to help you start your business, and they promise you access to a community of people that can help you along the way. In exchange, they only ask for a small amount of equity. Doesn’t sound that bad, no?</p><p>But by the end of this post I will convince you that it’s actually a terrible idea.</p><p>First, you have to understand a very important concept: in some systems, what’s best for a group is not necessarily what’s best for the individuals who make up the group. In other words, the total wealth of a group of people could be increasing, while almost everyone making up that group could be seeing their wealth diminish. When this happens, we say we have a non-ergodic system. If the system was ergodic, what’s happening to the collective would also translate to all individuals.</p><p><span>Silicon Valley is a non-ergodic industry (like Hollywood, book publishing, the music industry, and even your country’s economy unless you’re under full-blown communism.) A non-ergodic system is not necessarily bad, but if you’re not cognizant of the system you’re in, you’re going to be played like a fiddle. Those who benefit from the collective will take advantage of you, while you (as the individual) lose out. This is what YC will try to do to you. In fact, this is what YC </span><em>has</em><span> to do; otherwise it won’t survive. Let me explain. </span></p><p>Imagine you’re told there’s a bunch of hidden treasures within a 100 acre area. What’s the best strategy for finding some of these treasures?</p><p>One way is to pick a spot, and dedicate your entire life digging as far down as possible on that one spot. You might reason that the deeper the treasure, the bigger the loot. You don’t want to settle for a measly small treasure box. You want the full chest of diamonds buried near the end of the earth’s crust. This is your shot at glory.</p><p>Another way is to use a search method employed by search and rescue teams. You divide the area into small squares, and do a “reasonable search” in each one. You use probabilities and some common sense to help guide you how deep to dig, and then you move to the next square. If you encounter undisturbed compacted dirt, chances are there’s no treasure beneath. If you run into bedrock, it’s almost certain there’s nothing below. So you use that information and move on. Your goal is to search the entire area where there’s probable treasure as quickly as possible. Ideally within your lifetime.</p><p>I’m sure you agree with me that the first way is a dumb strategy. Almost every digger employing this strategy will die treasure-less. But actually, it’s only dumb for that individual treasure hunter. For a gold mining company, this is the optimal strategy.&nbsp;The company only needs one miner to hit jackpot, and all the other miners can die penniless. If the cost of sacrificing an individual treasure hunter is low, the most optimal strategy is to get tens of thousands of treasure hunters, allocate hundreds of them per acre, and make them dig all the way down to the earth’s core. The treasure hunting economy would grow much bigger than if all the individual treasure hunters were optimizing for their own self-interest.</p><p>So, digging in one spot is a dumb strategy for the economy of the individual, but a very wise strategy for the collective economy of all individuals.</p><p>This is what happens in a non-ergodic system. We often hear politicians claim that the GDP is growing, but all the gains are going to the 1%. This is the same thing. The wealth of a country could be growing, but almost all the citizens could be getting poorer. There’s nothing inconsistent with this. The average is simply being dragged up by the freak outliers.</p><p>The same thing happens in venture capital. The owners of the portfolio maximize their returns when the system is non-ergodic, because while the individual treasure hunter has one lifetime to strike gold, the VC portfolio has access to thousands of lifetimes: those of all the treasure hunters.</p><p>YC will proudly tell you that you are more likely to end up with a billion dollar business if you join them. That may be true. What they’re more reluctant to tell you is that only about 50 companies met that expectation out of the 4,000 or so that went through their program. That’s 1.25%. To be fair, that’s actually quite impressive, but let’s say you have the stamina and willpower to go through YC three times in your lifetime. You’d need approximately 26 lifetimes to hit the jackpot! Aha! See the problem now?</p><p>I don’t know about you, but I want to be successful in this lifetime. I can't afford to rely on 26 lifetimes. But maybe you think you’re special. You’re not like those 3,950 dummies who failed. Maybe you are in fact special, but I wouldn’t rely too much on that. Business is much more random than it seems. If business was predictable, YC wouldn't have a measly 1.25% success rate, or thereabouts.</p><p>You might think that those who failed might still have gotten something. Maybe. But failure is a very expensive way to learn those things. You don’t need to crash a plane to learn how to fly one. And whatever lessons are learned from going through YC are probably not very useful anyway, but more on that later.</p><p>One of the bad learnings you get from YC is that there’s a formula for success, and it looks like this: First you do some brainstorming. Then you come up with a good idea that can scale to a billion dollars (otherwise what’s the point of getting out of bed in the morning?) Then you work hard until you find “product-market-fit.” And then if the noises from investors indicate you won’t be getting a next round of funding, you start looking for a “pivot.”</p><p>This so-called formula is nonsense. First, good ideas rarely come to us from a brainstorming session. They come from wandering about with an open mind until we stumble on an opportunity worth pursuing. Most of your ideas will be bad ideas, because unfortunately you’re not a genius visionary. So the best way to find good ideas is to have many ideas, try them out, take what works, and throw away the rest. But this is not what YC wants you to do. YC wants you to pick an idea that has market pull (or the potential for it), and to then dig a hole in the same spot until you reach the boiling magma. Because what if you stop digging just before you strike gold? When you’re cheap and expandable, that’s not an optimal strategy for the YC fund. You must go all in. Diversification is for your YC overlords, not for you.</p><p>If you reach the magma layer and you still have nothing, then you’d be encouraged to pivot. But that’s not how you find business opportunities in the real world. You can’t just say I’m going to pivot, and suddenly a good opportunity lands on your lap from heaven. You get good ideas by embracing randomness for a long time, until something looks like it has a fighting chance of paying off. The pivot idea you were forced to come up with is extremely unlikely to be one. Your imagination is overrated. The YC execs didn’t imagine Stripe or Dropbox or AirBnb. Random things come to them during demo days. The YC folks are smart because they know their imagination is limited. And so should you. You can’t just pivot a business idea. And if you’re going to cherry pick some pivot that worked out of the thousands attempted, you should stop reading now. Just go join YC.</p><p><span>The second bad lesson from YC is the focus on the upside. But </span><em>if</em><span> there’s any formula for success in business, it’s to focus relentlessly on staying in the game rather than on hitting it big. Focus on the downside, and let the upside take care of itself. To thrive, you must first survive. To win the race, you must finish the race. And so on. But this is in tension with what YC wants you to do. They want you to dig deep to the middle of the earth, and if you don’t come back alive, tough luck. You were a brave soldier, but now it’s time for them to focus on the other 999 soldiers. YC is still alive, but you’re not.</span></p><p>Don’t be a dummy. Don’t be a bet in somebody else’s portfolio.</p><p>Ahahaha, you caught me! It’s true. I do have something to sell you. I run a community for small-time entrepreneurs who are satisfied with reliably attainable mediocre success. The YC folks feel sorry for our joy with mediocrity while they’re out there changing the world. And we reciprocate the emotion.</p><p>So yes, I am promoting something that goes against everything YC stands for. But if you think YC is not also selling you something, I have a bridge to sell you. But maybe I’m being a bit too harsh. Because what is it that YC is selling you exactly?</p><p>Me, I charge you a one-time payment of $245, and you get access to my community, which includes live workshops, recorded classes, a group chat, and a few other things. It’s very clear what I’m doing. I ask for some money in exchange for access, and those who give me the money get access. Even my 6 year old kid understands it.</p><p>But YC is not asking you for money. They actually give you money! It looks like you’re the one selling to them. You’re technically selling them a piece of your business, no?</p><p>No, no, no, hold on. The easiest way to see what YC is selling is to look at military recruitment. The military sells the narrative that serving your country is a noble endeavor. You’ll get a shot at glory, and at the very least you gain some important life skills. You’ll also get paid enough to feed yourself and cover your basic needs, but barely. The military wants to recruit expendable soldiers who will go out to the battlefield risking their lives and limb for the collective, while the generals with all the medals sit in an air conditioned room giving orders.</p><p>YC is no different. It wants to recruit wide-eyed young founders to pick a spot on the treasure map and dig all the way down through the earth’s crust. Most of them will spend years or decades digging, and all they end up with it is a ramen lifestyle. Usually bunched up with 4 roommates in a damp San Francisco basement living on take-out ramen noodles every single day. But hey, they’re young. They’ll have time to do adult things later, like starting family or making decent money. And at the very least, they’ll gain some important life lessons and make some good connections.</p><p>Think about this for a second: The most successful business owners are typically in their 40s and 50s. Why is YC full of 22 year olds? Why aren’t the 40 year old entrepreneurs taking up this incredible deal that YC is offering? YC will tell you it’s because only the 22 year old kids can be true visionaries. BULL. SHIT. You’re not a visionary. All those 4,000 kids who went into YC also thought they were visionaries, and where are they now? They’re all in the startup cemetery, except for a dozen or so who despite the low odds managed to flip 10 heads in a row. The biggest indicator YC is a bad deal is that only people who are easily duped take up these deals. </p><p>The best thing I learned about business is to avoid trying to predict what will work and what won’t. YC knows this. That's why they only make small bets in thousands of businesses. But YC will try to teach you the exact opposite.</p><p>Business is a lot more random than it seems. You can’t treat it like a predictable project. You need to treat it like a financial investment. Instead of investing your money, you’re investing your time and energy, which is as scarce and as precious as money (if not more). Tell me, how do you invest your money? Do you pick one amazing stock and put all your life savings on it? Of course not. You understand that finance is uncertain. What’s good today might not be good tomorrow. There are hidden risks everywhere. And even if your stock pick doesn’t go bust, the biggest gains are likely to happen elsewhere and you won’t benefit from them if you’re only exposed to one piece of equity.</p><p>YC teaches you to try to be a visionary. When you fail… Oopsie! Tough luck. The fund benefits from the non-ergodic nature of the system, but you’re out years of your time. But that’s not even the worst of it. You would have been taught things that not only won’t work in the real world of business, but are counterproductive. You will have to unlearn almost everything.</p><p>If you want to succeed in the real world (and within this lifetime), you need to try many small things, experiment, tinker, and build a portfolio of multiple income streams. You need to treat your time the same way you treat your brokerage account. You basically need to become a VC, but for your own ideas. To make the system ergodic, you must un-leverage yourself from going all in on one thing, and get access to many diverse income streams. The same way it’s wise to invest in a broad ETF, you should be doing the same things with your projects. YC will teach you to do the opposite, but you’ll have to unlearn all of it. And unfortunately unlearning is much harder than learning.</p></div></div>]]></description>

			<h3>CV</h3>
			<p><a id="Truong97" name="Truong97"></a><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Krause">Kai Krause</a></strong> [today: <a href="http://kai.sub.blue/">kai.sub.blue</a>]was born 1957 in Dortmund. He came to California in 1976 with two friends. He worked as a musician for <em>Disney Sound Effects</em>; <strike>the sound track for “Star Trek: The Movie” was created on his synthesizers</strike>*. <span>* In fact Kai won a Clio Award for his sound effects in a Star Wars radio spot.</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson,_Lake_&amp;_Powell">Emerson, Lake &amp; Powell</a> bought sound systems from him and he is still working with <a href="https://petergabriel.com/">Peter Gabriel</a> today in order to fulfill his vision of visualized music as 3D sculptures. [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refTruong97">Truong97</a>]</p>
			<p>He was running a forum for several years on AOL: <a href="https://mprove.de/script/90/KPT/index.html"><em>Kai’s Power Tips &amp; Tricks</em></a>. He gave people tips and little pieces of code on line, simply because they shared his passion for computer graphics. This became an extensive and valuable collection of practical information how to get special effects with <em>Adobe Photoshop</em>. It can still be downloaded from several web sites.

			<h3>The Company</h3>
			<p><img src="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/_media/high/history.jpg" height="441" width="803"></p>
			<p>Fig. 1 Timeline with companies and products</p>
			<p><em>Harward Systems Corporation</em> (HSC Software Corp.) [also <em>Happy Software Company</em>] was founded by John Wilczak. Ben Weiss and Kai joined him in 1991 at HSC and created the first version of <em>Kai’s Power Tools</em>. KPT is a set of plug-ins that use the Adobe Photoshop programing interface for 3rd party filters. Many ideas from <a href="https://mprove.de/script/90/KPT/index.html">Kai’s Power Tips &amp; Tricks</a> get implemented as simple and easy to use pieces of software. KPT evolved until version 3 in 1995. This release contains the <em>Texture Explorer</em>, the <em>Spheroid Designer</em> and <em>KPT Lens f/x</em> among others. <em>Convolver</em> came out as a separate product. HSC was renamed to <em>MetaTools, Inc.</em> the same year.</p>
			<p>Eric Wenger and Phil Clevenger came into the team to develop a landscape-simulating product called <em>Bryce</em> (named after the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/brca/index.htm">Bryce Canyon</a>). They started creating other kinds of software starting with <em>Kai’s Power GOO</em>, <em>Kai’s Photo Soap</em> and <em>Kai’s Power Show</em>. Before GOO, Kai was well known only by computer artists as a creator of creative tools. With GOO, Kai became noticed by a much broader audience. People played with GOO. The complex and difficult algorithms are well hidden by the interface. Even children can change images of their classmates or teachers to funny caricatures. Kai himself calls this sort of computer programs <em>funware</em>.</p>
			<p>In 1998 Phil Clevenger and Kai managed to transfer the main interface concepts from Bryce to <em>Poser3</em>. Poser was originally created by <em>Fractal Design</em>. The companies MetaTools and Fractal Design merged in 1997. The new company was named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaCreations"><em>MetaCreations Corp</em>.</a> In 1998 it had about 300 employees. The main office is in Santa Barbara, CA, but several other facilities e.g. in San Francisco, are part of MetaCreations. <a id="MCRE" name="MCRE"></a>[<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refMCRE">MCRE</a>]</p>

			<h4>Full Screen Mode</h4>
			<p><a id="Kai95-1" name="Kai95-1"></a>Kai describes how it came to the large dialogs in KPT3: <span><a href="https://docplayer.org/33181705-Kai-s-power-tools-forscher-handbuch-macintosh-power-macintosh-windows-95-version-von-steven-frank.html">Vorwort zu KPT 3.0 von Kai (S.10ff)</a>  </span> </p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>»I would love to interact with the image in the way that Levels or Curves does, but the plug-in interface as of today simply will not allow it. What that leads to is simply that the plug-in gets a rectangle and is supposed to do something with the pixels in some other room and then give them back.« [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refKai95">Kai95</a>]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Many of the filters in KPT3 like <em>KPT Texture Explorer</em>, <em>KPT Spheroid Designer</em> and <em>KPT Convolver</em> use a rectangular area that fits on a 14" monitor. All other elements get blacked out – no menu bar, no Photoshop image window and no desktop. The user experience is really like coming into a room with a special suited environment for one specific task.</p>

			<p>KPT Texture Explorer is a modal dialog, that is especially prepared to create textures and nothing else.</p>

			<p>Fig. 3 KPT Spheroid Designer 3.0</p>
			<p>KPT Spheroid Designer is meant to create collections of special looking orbs. Different controls allow the definition of light or to select a special surface structure for the orbs. The KPT users manual notes that Spheroid Designer may seem to resemble glass balls dropped into mud, but actually it’s meant to be glass balls embedded in an “old stale brownie”.

			<p><a id="Tog96" name="Tog96"></a><a href="http://asktog.com/">Bruce “Tog” Tognazzini</a> writes about <em>Kansei Engineering</em>:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>»Since the year A.D. 618 the Japanese have been creating beautiful Zen gardens, environments of harmony designed to instill in their users a sense of serenity and peace. […] Every rock and tree is thoughtfully placed in patterns that are at once random and yet teeming with order. Rocks are not just strewn about; they are carefully arranged in odd-numbered groupings and sunk into the ground to give the illusion of age and stability. Waterfalls are not simply lined with interesting rocks; they are tuned to create just the right burble and plop. […]<br>
					
					Kansei speakes to a totality of experience: colors, sounds, shapes, tactile sensations, and kinesthesia, as well as the personality and consistency of interactions.« [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refTog96">Tog96</a>, pp. 171]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Then Tog comes to software design:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>»Where does kansei start? Not with the hardware. Not with the software either. Kansei starts with attitude, as does quality. The original <a href="https://mprove.de/visionreality/text/3.1.6_xeroxstar.html">Xerox Star</a> team had it. So did the <a href="https://mprove.de/visionreality/text/3.1.8_lisa.html">Lisa</a> team, and the <a href="https://mprove.de/visionreality/text/3.1.9_macintosh.html">Mac</a> team after. All were dedicated to building a single, tightly integrated environment – a totality of experience. […]<br>
					KPT Convolver […] is a marvelous example of kansei design. It replaces the extensive lineup of filters that graphic designers traditionally grapple with when using such tools as Photoshop with a simple, integrated, harmonious environment.<br>
					In the past, designers have followed a process of picturing their desired end result in their mind, then applying a series of filters sequentially, without benefit of undo beyond the last-applied filter. Convolver lets users play, trying any combination of filters at will, either on their own or with the computer’s aid and advice. […] Both time and space lie at the user’s complete control.« [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refTog96">Tog96</a>, pp. 174]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Many of the interface ideas evolved from <em>KPT</em> into <em>Bryce</em>. It is a whole environment that covers the complete screen. It overcomes the limitation of a fixed 14" rectangle, because the interface scales itself to the according screen dimensions. The same holds for <em>Poser3</em> and <em>KPT5</em> as they were shipped late in 1998.</p>

			<h4><a id="rooms" name="rooms"></a><a name="Lombreglia97"></a>Rooms</h4>
			<blockquote>
				<p>»The writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Updike">John Updike</a> is said to have several different writing rooms in his home, each used for a different kind of work -- a fiction room, a poetry room, a room for writing essays and book reviews. All writers want a special room for working (with door, without telephone), but why would any writer -- even such a deservedly successful and prosperous one as John Updike -- need entirely different rooms for different kinds of writing?<br>
					Actually, I know exactly why. Mr. Updike’s arrangement sounded great to me the first time I heard about it. I’m sure working in those rooms is his way of staying inspired, fighting boredom and distraction, getting creative work done by being in a space that’s not only set aside for work but that also somehow provokes that work, probably in quite subtle ways.« [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refLombreglia97">Lombreglia97</a>]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><a name="Fig6 GOO"></a><img id="goo" src="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/_media/high/GOO.jpg" name="goo"></p>
			<p>Fig. 6 Kai’s Power GOO</p>
			<p>The <em>GOO room</em> is a specialized environment for shifting pixels around. But because Kai’s Power GOO is one of the first stand-alone applications from MetaTools some operating systems tasks like opening and closing images need to be accessible within the application. In order not to clutter the room that is special suited to edit the image, other rooms become part of the application. <span><a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3005783/software-graphics/an-ode-to-kais-power-goo.html"><span>cf. An ode to Kai’s Power Goo, Macworld 11/2015</span></a></span> E.g. <em>Kai’s Photo Soap</em> (Fig. 7) initially presents you with a series of seven “rooms” – In, Prep, Tone, Color, Detail, Finishing and Out – which one can enter to perform particular tasks.</p>
			<p><img id="soap-rooms" src="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/_media/high/SoapRooms.jpg" name="soap-rooms"></p>
			<p>Fig. 7 Plan-Room in Kai’s Photo Soap</p>
			<h3><a id="Bier93" name="Bier93"></a>Minimize the Interface</h3>
			<p>The concept of Magic Lenses was introduced by [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refBier93">Bier et al. 93</a>]. Two years later Kai designed a tool for KPT3 that can be dragged on top of an image. A circled look-through area shows a preview of the selected filter attributes.</p>
			<p><img id="lens" src="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/_media/high/KPTLens.jpg" name="lens"></p>
			<p>Fig. 8 KPT Lens f/x 3.0 on top of a Photoshop image window</p>
			<p><a name="Kai95-2"></a>Kai himself describes the design concept that lead to the lens tool in KPT3:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>»What is called the “lenses” was in alpha known as the Dragon, as in “drag-on-the-image” and its design concept was so simple: make a precision instrument, like a little Swiss Army knife or a watch or microscope (it was also known as the fx Scope…) which has just a few very tiny controls around a center window. In this window a number of effects could be shown exactly as they would appear, over the real image, and updated in realtime.<br>
					It’s a lovely idea to keep all kinds of options hidden inside little wheels and dials that pop out to set and hide themselves during use… I think we have barely begun to use all the possibilities of that. And the actual interaction with the screen image is still a little clunky, hampered by the very illegality of bypassing the plug-in interface altogether.« [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refKai95">Kai95</a>]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Soap is the consequent next step into this direction. The tools no longer need to be modal like the KPT lens; they can be used in a very natural modeless manner. Pens, brushes and erasers are distributed all over the workspace. They are large, they cast <strike>real</strike> virtual shadows, and the tips of the tools get pressed down while they are in use.</p>
			<p><img id="soap" src="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/_media/high/Soap.jpg" name="soap" height="500" width="776"></p>
			<p>Fig. 9 Kai’s Photo Soap, the Color Room</p>
			<h3>The Desktop</h3>
			<p>The In rooms from <em>Soap</em> and <em>Show</em> are an attempt to deal with a large amount of image files. Large previews – compared to normal icons in Finder – can be distributed on a desktop area. They can be scaled and they can overlap each other. Selections of them can be stored into scrapbooks (Soap) or treated as pile objects (Show). The latter is a proposal to avoid the classical “file in folder in folder in folder” method. The stack of white images to the upper right in Fig. 10 is an example for a pile.</p>

			<h4>Update 2015</h4>
			<p>In retrospect many of Kai's user interface designs make perfect sense as iPad apps. Just imagine <em>KPT Spheroid Designer</em> or <em>Kai’s Power Goo</em> as an app!</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.benweiss.com/">Ben Weiss</a>, <a href="http://kai.subblue.com/">Kai Krause</a>, together with <a href="http://subblue.com/">Tom Beddard</a> have created <a href="http://app-design-critique.tumblr.com/post/134043897648/frax">frax HD</a> that was launched in October 2013.</p>

			<p>Fig. 11: frax HD</p>
			<h2><a name="interfacelanguage" id="interfacelanguage"></a>Kai’s Interface Language</h2>
			<h3>Unfolding functionality</h3>
			<p>Interface widgets become visible on demand. <em>KPT Convolver</em> has three modes: Explore, Design and Tweak. The controls that are not used for a specific mode are dimmed. (<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/zoom/Fig4Convolver.html">Fig. 4 KPT Convolver</a>)</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>A rearrangement of widgets on mode changes is not necessary. The view remains familiar.</p>
				<p>The user becomes curious to explore the interface.</p>
				<p>Everything is accessible at once, because the mode changes if one clicks onto a faded item.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>MouseOver</h3>
			<p>Tools fade out if they are not in use. If the mouse cursor is moved over these items they wake up. All the tools to the right and below the main view in the Bryce interface are normally invisible (<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/zoom/Fig5Bryce.html">Fig. 5 Bryce 2</a>). The film strip, the camera and all other elements on the border of the <em>GOO</em> room increase in contrast when the mouse moves over (<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/zoom/Fig6Goo.html">Fig. 6 Kai’s Power GOO</a>).</p>
			<p>Interface widgets get an explanation when the mouse gets moved over these items. (KPT, Bryce, Poser)</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>The view gets focused to the task. Distracting items are out of sight.</p>
				<p>The Cockpit problem gets solved, because one can handle the numerous controls in larger chunks.</p>
				<p>The user becomes curious to explore the interface.</p>
				<p>Better spatial arrangement of widgets, because the label is omitted. (Bryce’ toolbar)</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>MouseDragging instead of Value-Slider</h3>
			<p>Classical sliders and scrollbars use a thumb, that can be dragged to a specific value. <em>KPT3</em> or <em>KPT Convolver</em> use simple orbs that serve as origin of a mouse drag action. (e.g. Hue, Saturation, etc. in <a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/zoom/Fig2Texture.html">Fig. 2 KPT Texture Explorer 3.0</a>)</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>An orb and a referring label is less space consuming than a value slider.</p>
				<p>Kai’s sliders provide real time feedback for the edited object, because the control does not display any feedback by itself.</p>
				<p>The value space can be 2-dimensional, because the x- and y-direction can have a different meaning</p>
			</ul>
			<h4>Cons</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>It is very difficult to enter exact numerical values.</p>
				<p>The control displays no feedback about the selected value.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>Memory Dots / Five Favorites</h3>
			<p><em>KPT Spheroid Designer</em>, <em>KPT Convolver</em> and <em>KPT5</em> use 3x3 fields of memory dots. These dots can store different settings of other interface widgets. <em>Soap</em> and <em>Show</em> usefive dots for the same task.</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>The user can customize tools, store control values and can flip between different interface arrangements.</p>
				<p>The access time is very short.</p>
			</ul>
			<h4>Cons</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>Memory Dots provide no visual feedback. One has to activate the dot to recognize its content. An icon or MouseOver-Preview might be helpful. The film strip at <em>GOO</em> provides such feedback already.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>Transparency &amp; Shadows (KPT Lens f/x, Poser)</h3>
			<p><span>Note, this is years before Mac OS X Aqua. </span>Nearly every item in Kai’s interfaces drops a smooth shadow. This is part of the kansei attitude of building harmonic environments.</p>
			<p>Modal dialog windows from <em>GOO</em>, the menus from <em>Show</em> and the information palette from <em>Soap</em> are translucent.</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>The object underneath the pane remains visible.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>Full Screen Mode, Rooms Metaphor</h3>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>Design in every respect – Kansei Design</p>
				<p>Special suited environments for special tasks support that task perfectly.</p>
				<p>No window clutter</p>
			</ul>
			<h4>Cons</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>Only one room at a time can be active.</p>
				<p>There is hardly any interaction with other programs. They are not visible; therefore drag and drop is not possible. One is no longer aware of other “rooms” on the machine.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>Workspace – Desktop</h3>
			<p><em>GOO</em> has only a gallery in a grid for images. <em>Soap</em> and <em>Show</em> (<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/zoom/Fig10Show.html">Fig. 10 The Sort-Room of Kai’s Power SHOW</a>) use a more drawn out version of a desktop to display collections of media files.</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>Better implementation of a real life desktop.</p>
				<p>Previews are very useful to recognize imagefiles.</p>
			</ul>
			<h4>Cons</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>Very limited for hierarchical structures</p>
				<p>Arrangements cannot be stored for later use.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>MetaWindow</h3>
			<p>Windows without classical borders and handles (Poser3)</p>
			<p>Drawers, that reveal assets or functionalities on demand (Soap, Poser3)</p>
			<p>Scrapbooks, that store objects (Soap)</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>This is an obvious way to get a hierarchical level into the interface.</p>
				<p>Things, that are not needed every time, are only two clicks away.</p>
			</ul>
			<h2>And they are living happily ever after…</h2>
			<p>Quite so. Kai Krause left MetaCreations in 1999. The same year the company was renamed into  <em>Viewpoint Corporation</em> to focus on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewpoint_Media_Player">MetaStreams</a>, a 3D-Web technology.</p>
			<p>Some people consulted with Apple to make a huge impact on the new Aqua design of Mac OS X.</p>
			<p><em>google Picasa</em> was designed and developed by meta folks. And <em>Adobe Lightroom</em> is a powerful product for digital photography.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="content"><article lang="en-US"><header></header><div><p>Users want web experiences with content that is fast to load and smooth to interact with. Therefore, a developer should strive to achieve these two goals.</p>
<p>To understand how to improve performance and perceived performance, it helps to understand how the browser works.</p></div><section aria-labelledby="overview"><h2 id="overview"><a href="#overview">Overview</a></h2><div><p>Fast sites provide better user experiences. Users want and expect web experiences with content that is fast to load and smooth to interact with.</p>
<p>Two major issues in web performance are issues having to do with latency and issues having to do with the fact that for the most part, browsers are single-threaded.</p>
<p>Latency is the biggest threat to our ability to ensure a fast-loading page. It is the developers' goal to make the site load as fast as possible — or at least <em>appear</em> to load super fast — so the user gets the requested information as quickly as possible. Network latency is the time it takes to transmit bytes over the air to computers. Web performance is what we have to do to make the page load as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>For the most part, browsers are considered single-threaded. That is, they execute a task from beginning to end before taking up another task. For smooth interactions, the developer's goal is to ensure performant site interactions, from smooth scrolling to being responsive to touch. Render time is key, ensuring the main thread can complete all the work we throw at it and still always be available to handle user interactions. Web performance can be improved by understanding the single-threaded nature of the browser and minimizing the main thread's responsibilities, where possible and appropriate, to ensure rendering is smooth and responses to interactions are immediate.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="navigation"><h2 id="navigation"><a href="#navigation">Navigation</a></h2><div><p><em>Navigation</em> is the first step in loading a web page. It occurs whenever a user requests a page by entering a URL into the address bar, clicking a link, submitting a form, as well as other actions.</p>
<p>One of the goals of web performance is to minimize the amount of time navigation takes to complete. In ideal conditions, this usually doesn't take too long, but latency and bandwidth are foes that can cause delays.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="dns_lookup"><h3 id="dns_lookup"><a href="#dns_lookup">DNS lookup</a></h3><div><p>The first step of navigating to a web page is finding where the assets for that page are located. If you navigate to <code>https://example.com</code>, the HTML page is located on the server with IP address of <code>93.184.216.34</code>. If you've never visited this site, a DNS lookup must happen.</p>
<p>Your browser requests a DNS lookup, which is eventually fielded by a name server, which in turn responds with an IP address. After this initial request, the IP will likely be cached for a time, which speeds up subsequent requests by retrieving the IP address from the cache instead of contacting a name server again.</p>
<p>DNS lookups usually only need to be done once per hostname for a page load. However, DNS lookups must be done for each unique hostname the requested page references. If your fonts, images, scripts, ads, and metrics all have different hostnames, a DNS lookup will have to be made for each one.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work/latency.jpg" alt="Mobile requests go first to the cell tower, then to a central phone company computer before being sent to the internet" width="792" height="281" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>This can be problematic for performance, particularly on mobile networks. When a user is on a mobile network, each DNS lookup has to go from the phone to the cell tower to reach an authoritative DNS server. The distance between a phone, a cell tower, and the name server can add significant latency.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="tcp_handshake"><h3 id="tcp_handshake"><a href="#tcp_handshake">TCP handshake</a></h3><div><p>Once the IP address is known, the browser sets up a connection to the server via a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP_handshake">TCP three-way handshake</a>. This mechanism is designed so that two entities attempting to communicate — in this case the browser and web server — can negotiate the parameters of the network TCP socket connection before transmitting data, often over <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTPS">HTTPS</a>.</p>
<p>TCP's three-way handshaking technique is often referred to as "SYN-SYN-ACK" — or more accurately SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK — because there are three messages transmitted by TCP to negotiate and start a TCP session between two computers. Yes, this means three more messages back and forth between each server, and the request has yet to be made.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="tls_negotiation"><h3 id="tls_negotiation"><a href="#tls_negotiation">TLS negotiation</a></h3><div><p>For secure connections established over HTTPS, another "handshake" is required. This handshake, or rather the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS">TLS</a> negotiation, determines which cipher will be used to encrypt the communication, verifies the server, and establishes that a secure connection is in place before beginning the actual transfer of data. This requires five more round trips to the server before the request for content is actually sent.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work/ssl.jpg" alt="The DNS lookup, the TCP handshake, and 5 steps of the TLS handshake including clienthello, serverhello and certificate, clientkey and finished for both server and client." width="729" height="412" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>While making the connection secure adds time to the page load, a secure connection is worth the latency expense, as the data transmitted between the browser and the web server cannot be decrypted by a third party.</p>
<p>After the eight round trips to the server, the browser is finally able to make the request.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="response"><h2 id="response"><a href="#response">Response</a></h2><div><p>Once we have an established connection to a web server, the browser sends an initial <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods">HTTP <code>GET</code> request</a> on behalf of the user, which for websites is most often an HTML file. Once the server receives the request, it will reply with relevant response headers and the contents of the HTML.</p>

<p>This response for this initial request contains the first byte of data received. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Time_to_first_byte">Time to First Byte</a> (TTFB) is the time between when the user made the request — say by clicking on a link — and the receipt of this first packet of HTML. The first chunk of content is usually 14KB of data.</p>
<p>In our example above, the request is definitely less than 14KB, but the linked resources aren't requested until the browser encounters the links during parsing, described below.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="congestion_control_tcp_slow_start"><h3 id="congestion_control_tcp_slow_start"><a href="#congestion_control_tcp_slow_start">Congestion control / TCP slow start</a></h3><div><p>TCP packets are split into segments during transmission. Because TCP guarantees the sequence of packets, the server must receive an acknowledgment from the client in the form of an ACK packet after sending a certain number of segments.</p>
<p>If the server waits for an ACK after each segment, that will result in frequent ACKs from the client and may increase transmission time, even in the case of a low-load network.</p>
<p>On the other hand, sending too many segments at once can lead to the problem that in a busy network the client will not be able to receive the segments and will just keep responding with ACKs for a long time, and the server will have to keep re-sending the segments.</p>
<p>In order to balance the number of transmitted segments, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP_slow_start">TCP slow start</a> algorithm is used to gradually increase the amount of transmitted data until the maximum network bandwidth can be determined, and to reduce the amount of transmitted data in case of high network load.</p>
<p>The number of segments to be transmitted is controlled by the value of the congestion window (CWND), which can be initialized to 1, 2, 4, or 10 MSS (MSS is 1500 bytes over the Ethernet protocol). That value is the number of bytes to send, upon receipt of which the client must send an ACK.</p>
<p>If an ACK is received, then the CWND value will be doubled, and so the server will be able to send more segments the next time. If instead no ACK is received, then the CWND value will be halved. That mechanism thus achieves a balance between sending too many segments, and sending too few.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="parsing"><h2 id="parsing"><a href="#parsing">Parsing</a></h2><div><p>Once the browser receives the first chunk of data, it can begin parsing the information received. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Parse">Parsing</a> is the step the browser takes to turn the data it receives over the network into the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM">DOM</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSSOM">CSSOM</a>, which is used by the renderer to paint a page to the screen.</p>
<p>The DOM is the internal representation of the markup for the browser. The DOM is also exposed and can be manipulated through various APIs in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Even if the requested page's HTML is larger than the initial 14KB packet, the browser will begin parsing and attempting to render an experience based on the data it has. This is why it's important for web performance optimization to include everything the browser needs to start rendering a page, or at least a template of the page — the CSS and HTML needed for the first render — in the first 14KB. But before anything is rendered to the screen, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have to be parsed.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="building_the_dom_tree"><h3 id="building_the_dom_tree"><a href="#building_the_dom_tree">Building the DOM tree</a></h3><div><p>We describe five steps in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Critical_rendering_path">critical rendering path</a>.</p>
<p>The first step is processing the HTML markup and building the DOM tree. HTML parsing involves <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMTokenList">tokenization</a> and tree construction. HTML tokens include start and end tags, as well as attribute names and values. If the document is well-formed, parsing it is straightforward and faster. The parser parses tokenized input into the document, building up the document tree.</p>
<p>The DOM tree describes the content of the document. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html"><code>&lt;html&gt;</code></a> element is the first element and root node of the document tree. The tree reflects the relationships and hierarchies between different elements. Elements nested within other elements are child nodes. The greater the number of DOM nodes, the longer it takes to construct the DOM tree.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work/dom.gif" alt="The DOM tree for our sample code, showing all the nodes, including text nodes." width="754" height="689" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>When the parser finds non-blocking resources, such as an image, the browser will request those resources and continue parsing. Parsing can continue when a CSS file is encountered, but <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements — particularly those without an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function"><code>async</code></a> or <code>defer</code> attribute — block rendering, and pause the parsing of HTML. Though the browser's preload scanner hastens this process, excessive scripts can still be a significant bottleneck.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="preload_scanner"><h3 id="preload_scanner"><a href="#preload_scanner">Preload scanner</a></h3><div><p>While the browser builds the DOM tree, this process occupies the main thread. As this happens, the <em>preload scanner</em> will parse through the content available and request high-priority resources like CSS, JavaScript, and web fonts. Thanks to the preload scanner, we don't have to wait until the parser finds a reference to an external resource to request it. It will retrieve resources in the background so that by the time the main HTML parser reaches the requested assets, they may already be in flight or have been downloaded. The optimizations the preload scanner provides reduce blockages.</p>
<div><pre data-signature="7i2pOGLEWk9zRizsF65+Y7TiIADbAa3ECiZF6ZUCWpA="><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>stylesheet<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>styles.css<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>myscript.js<span>"</span></span> <span>async</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>myimage.jpg<span>"</span></span> <span>alt</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>image description<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>anotherscript.js<span>"</span></span> <span>async</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this example, while the main thread is parsing the HTML and CSS, the preload scanner will find the scripts and image, and start downloading them as well. To ensure the script doesn't block the process, add the <code>async</code> attribute, or the <code>defer</code> attribute if JavaScript parsing and execution order is important.</p>
<p>Waiting to obtain CSS doesn't block HTML parsing or downloading, but it does block JavaScript because JavaScript is often used to query CSS properties' impact on elements.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="building_the_cssom_tree"><h3 id="building_the_cssom_tree"><a href="#building_the_cssom_tree">Building the CSSOM tree</a></h3><div><p>The second step in the critical rendering path is processing CSS and building the CSSOM tree. The CSS object model is similar to the DOM. The DOM and CSSOM are both trees. They are independent data structures. The browser converts the CSS rules into a map of styles it can understand and work with. The browser goes through each rule set in the CSS, creating a tree of nodes with parent, child, and sibling relationships based on the CSS selectors.</p>
<p>As with HTML, the browser needs to convert the received CSS rules into something it can work with. Hence, it repeats the HTML-to-object process, but for the CSS.</p>
<p>The CSSOM tree includes styles from the user agent style sheet. The browser begins with the most general rule applicable to a node and recursively refines the computed styles by applying more specific rules. In other words, it cascades the property values.</p>
<p>Building the CSSOM is very, very fast and is not displayed in a unique color in current developer tools. Rather, the "Recalculate Style" in developer tools shows the total time it takes to parse CSS, construct the CSSOM tree, and recursively calculate computed styles. In terms of web performance optimization, there are lower hanging fruit, as the total time to create the CSSOM is generally less than the time it takes for one DNS lookup.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="other_processes"><h3 id="other_processes"><a href="#other_processes">Other processes</a></h3><div><h4 id="javascript_compilation">JavaScript compilation</h4>
<p>While the CSS is being parsed and the CSSOM created, other assets, including JavaScript files, are downloading (thanks to the preload scanner). JavaScript is parsed, compiled, and interpreted. The scripts are parsed into abstract syntax trees. Some browser engines take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Tree" target="_blank">abstract syntax trees</a> and pass them into a compiler, outputting bytecode. This is known as JavaScript compilation. Most of the code is interpreted on the main thread, but there are exceptions such as code run in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">web workers</a>.</p>
<h4 id="building_the_accessibility_tree">Building the accessibility tree</h4>
<p>The browser also builds an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility">accessibility</a> tree that assistive devices use to parse and interpret content. The accessibility object model (AOM) is like a semantic version of the DOM. The browser updates the accessibility tree when the DOM is updated. The accessibility tree is not modifiable by assistive technologies themselves.</p>
<p>Until the AOM is built, the content is not accessible to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Screen_Reader_Implementors_Guide">screen readers</a>.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="render"><h2 id="render"><a href="#render">Render</a></h2><p>Rendering steps include style, layout, paint, and in some cases compositing. The CSSOM and DOM trees created in the parsing step are combined into a render tree which is then used to compute the layout of every visible element, which is then painted to the screen. In some cases, content can be promoted to its own layer and composited, improving performance by painting portions of the screen on the GPU instead of the CPU, freeing up the main thread.</p></section><section aria-labelledby="style"><h3 id="style"><a href="#style">Style</a></h3><div><p>The third step in the critical rendering path is combining the DOM and CSSOM into a render tree. The computed style tree, or render tree, construction starts with the root of the DOM tree, traversing each visible node.</p>
<p>Elements that aren't going to be displayed, like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head"><code>&lt;head&gt;</code></a> element and its children and any nodes with <code>display: none</code>, such as the <code>script { display: none; }</code> you will find in user agent stylesheets, are not included in the render tree as they will not appear in the rendered output. Nodes with <code>visibility: hidden</code> applied are included in the render tree, as they do take up space. As we have not given any directives to override the user agent default, the <code>script</code> node in our code example above will not be included in the render tree.</p>
<p>Each visible node has its CSSOM rules applied to it. The render tree holds all the visible nodes with content and computed styles — matching up all the relevant styles to every visible node in the DOM tree, and determining, based on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade">CSS cascade</a>, what the computed styles are for each node.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="layout"><h3 id="layout"><a href="#layout">Layout</a></h3><div><p>The fourth step in the critical rendering path is running layout on the render tree to compute the geometry of each node. <em>Layout</em> is the process by which the dimensions and location of all the nodes in the render tree are determined, plus the determination of the size and position of each object on the page. <em>Reflow</em> is any subsequent size and position determination of any part of the page or the entire document.</p>
<p>Once the render tree is built, layout commences. The render tree identified which nodes are displayed (even if invisible) along with their computed styles, but not the dimensions or location of each node. To determine the exact size and position of each object, the browser starts at the root of the render tree and traverses it.</p>
<p>On the web page, almost everything is a box. Different devices and different desktop preferences mean an unlimited number of differing viewport sizes. In this phase, taking the viewport size into consideration, the browser determines what the sizes of all the different boxes are going to be on the screen. Taking the size of the viewport as its base, layout generally starts with the body, laying out the sizes of all the body's descendants, with each element's box model properties, providing placeholder space for replaced elements it doesn't know the dimensions of, such as our image.</p>
<p>The first time the size and position of each node is determined is called <em>layout</em>. Subsequent recalculations of are called <em>reflows</em>. In our example, suppose the initial layout occurs before the image is returned. Since we didn't declare the dimensions of our image, there will be a reflow once the image dimensions are known.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="paint"><h3 id="paint"><a href="#paint">Paint</a></h3><div><p>The last step in the critical rendering path is painting the individual nodes to the screen, the first occurrence of which is called the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First_meaningful_paint">first meaningful paint</a>. In the painting or rasterization phase, the browser converts each box calculated in the layout phase to actual pixels on the screen. Painting involves drawing every visual part of an element to the screen, including text, colors, borders, shadows, and replaced elements like buttons and images. The browser needs to do this super quickly.</p>
<p>To ensure smooth scrolling and animation, everything occupying the main thread, including calculating styles, along with reflow and paint, must take the browser less than 16.67ms to accomplish. At 2048 x 1536, the iPad has over 3,145,000 pixels to be painted to the screen. That is a lot of pixels that have to be painted very quickly. To ensure repainting can be done even faster than the initial paint, the drawing to the screen is generally broken down into several layers. If this occurs, then compositing is necessary.</p>
<p>Painting can break the elements in the layout tree into layers. Promoting content into layers on the GPU (instead of the main thread on the CPU) improves paint and repaint performance. There are specific properties and elements that instantiate a layer, including <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video"><code>&lt;video&gt;</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas"><code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code></a>, and any element which has the CSS properties of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/opacity"><code>opacity</code></a>, a 3D <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform"><code>transform</code></a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/will-change"><code>will-change</code></a>, and a few others. These nodes will be painted onto their own layer, along with their descendants, unless a descendant necessitates its own layer for one (or more) of the above reasons.</p>
<p>Layers do improve performance but are expensive when it comes to memory management, so should not be overused as part of web performance optimization strategies.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="compositing"><h3 id="compositing"><a href="#compositing">Compositing</a></h3><div><p>When sections of the document are drawn in different layers, overlapping each other, compositing is necessary to ensure they are drawn to the screen in the right order and the content is rendered correctly.</p>
<p>As the page continues to load assets, reflows can happen (recall our example image that arrived late). A reflow sparks a repaint and a re-composite. Had we defined the dimensions of our image, no reflow would have been necessary, and only the layer that needed to be repainted would be repainted, and composited if necessary. But we didn't include the image dimensions! When the image is obtained from the server, the rendering process goes back to the layout steps and restarts from there.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="interactivity"><h2 id="interactivity"><a href="#interactivity">Interactivity</a></h2><div><p>Once the main thread is done painting the page, you would think we would be "all set." That isn't necessarily the case. If the load includes JavaScript, that was correctly deferred, and only executed after the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event"><code>onload</code></a> event fires, the main thread might be busy, and not available for scrolling, touch, and other interactions.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Time_to_interactive">Time to Interactive</a> (TTI) is the measurement of how long it took from that first request which led to the DNS lookup and TCP connection to when the page is interactive — interactive being the point in time after the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First_contentful_paint">First Contentful Paint</a> when the page responds to user interactions within 50ms. If the main thread is occupied parsing, compiling, and executing JavaScript, it is not available and therefore not able to respond to user interactions in a timely (less than 50ms) fashion.</p>
<p>In our example, maybe the image loaded quickly, but perhaps the <code>anotherscript.js</code> file was 2MB and our user's network connection was slow. In this case, the user would see the page super quickly, but wouldn't be able to scroll without jank until the script was downloaded, parsed, and executed. That is not a good user experience. Avoid occupying the main thread, as demonstrated in this WebPageTest example:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work/visa_network.png" alt="The main thread is occupied by the downloading, parsing and execution of a JavaScript file - over a fast connection" width="1200" height="699" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>In this example, JavaScript execution took over 1.5 seconds, and the main thread was fully occupied that entire time, unresponsive to click events or screen taps.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="see_also"><h2 id="see_also"><a href="#see_also">See also</a></h2></section></article></main></div></div>]]></description>

<p>A prominent cryptography expert has told New Scientist that a US spy agency could be weakening a new generation of algorithms designed to protect against hackers equipped with quantum computers.</p>
<p><a href="https://cr.yp.to/djb.html">Daniel Bernstein</a> at the University of Illinois Chicago says that the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is deliberately obscuring the level of involvement the US National Security Agency (NSA) has in developing new encryption standards for “post-quantum cryptography” (PQC). He also believes that NIST has made errors&nbsp;– either accidental or deliberate&nbsp;– in calculations describing the security of the new standards. NIST denies the claims.</p>
<p>“NIST isn’t following procedures designed to stop NSA from weakening PQC,” says Bernstein. “People choosing cryptographic standards should be transparently and verifiably following clear public rules so that we don’t need&nbsp;to worry about their motivations. NIST promised transparency and then claimed it&nbsp;had shown all its work, but that&nbsp;claim simply isn’t true.”</p>
<p>The mathematical problems we use to protect data are practically impossible for even the largest supercomputers to crack today. But when quantum computers become <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2379347-which-quantum-computer-is-the-most-powerful-ever-its-complicated/">reliable and powerful enough</a>, they will be able to break them in moments.</p>

    
<p>Although it is <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2370022-cryptographers-bet-cash-on-when-quantum-computers-will-beat-encryption/">unclear when such computers will emerge</a>, NIST&nbsp;has been running a project <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Presentations/Let-s-Get-Ready-to-Rumble-The-NIST-PQC-Competiti/images-media/PQCrypto-April2018_Moody.pdf">since 2012</a> to standardise a new generation of algorithms that <span></span> resist their attacks. Bernstein, who <a href="https://archive.ph/BHGOM">coined the term post-quantum cryptography</a> in 2003 to refer to these kinds of algorithms, says the&nbsp;NSA is actively engaged in putting secret weaknesses into new encryption standards that will allow them to be more easily cracked with the right knowledge. NIST’s standards are used globally, so flaws could have a large impact.</p>
<p>Bernstein alleges that NIST’s calculations for one of the upcoming PQC standards, Kyber512, are “glaringly wrong”, making it appear more secure than it really is. He says that NIST multiplied two numbers together when it would have been more correct to add them, resulting in an artificially high assessment of Kyber512’s robustness to attack.</p>
<p>“We disagree with his analysis,” says <a href="https://www.nist.gov/people/dustin-moody">Dustin Moody</a> at NIST. “It’s a&nbsp;question for which there isn’t scientific certainty and intelligent people can have different views. We respect Dan’s opinion, but don’t agree with what he says.”</p>
<p>Moody says that Kyber512 meets NIST’s “level one” security criteria, which makes it at least as hard to&nbsp;break as a commonly used existing algorithm, AES-128. That&nbsp;said, NIST recommends that, in practice, people should use a stronger version, Kyber768, which Moody says was a suggestion from&nbsp;the algorithm’s developers.</p>

    
<p>NIST is currently in a period of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2327054-us-chooses-encryption-tools-to-protect-us-from-quantum-computers/">public consultation</a> and hopes to reveal the final standards for PQC algorithms next year so that organisations can begin to adopt them. The Kyber algorithm seems likely to make the cut as it has already progressed through several layers of selection.</p>
<p>Given its secretive nature, it is difficult to say for sure whether or&nbsp;not the NSA has influenced the&nbsp;PQC standards, but there have&nbsp;long been suggestions and&nbsp;rumours that the agency deliberately weakens encryption algorithms. In 2013, The New York Times reported that the agency <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/us/documents-reveal-nsa-campaign-against-encryption.html">had a budget of $250&nbsp;million for the task</a>, and intelligence agency documents leaked by Edward Snowden in the same year contained references to the NSA deliberately placing a backdoor in&nbsp;a cryptography algorithm, although that algorithm was <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/government-announces-steps-to-restore-confidence-on-encryption-standards/">later dropped from official standards</a>.</p>
<p>Moody denies that NIST would ever agree to deliberately weaken a&nbsp;standard at the behest of the NSA and says that any secret weakness would have had to be inserted without its knowledge. He also says that in the wake of the Snowden revelations, NIST has tightened guidelines to ensure transparency and security and to&nbsp;rebuild confidence with cryptographic experts.</p>
<p>“We wouldn’t have ever intentionally done anything like&nbsp;that,” says Moody, but he acknowledges the Snowden leaks&nbsp;caused a backlash. “Anytime the NSA gets brought up, there’s a&nbsp;number of cryptographers that are&nbsp;concerned and we’ve tried to be open and transparent about our interactions.”</p>

    
<p>Moody says that the NSA has&nbsp;also – as far as a secretive intelligence agency can – tried to&nbsp;be more open. But the agency declined to comment when approached by <em>New Scientist</em>.</p>
<p>“All we can do is tell people that&nbsp;NIST are the ones in the room&nbsp;making the decisions, but if&nbsp;you don’t believe us, there’s no way you could verify that without being inside NIST,” says Moody.</p>
<p>However, Bernstein alleges that&nbsp;NIST hasn’t been open about the level of input by the NSA, “stonewalling” him when he has&nbsp;asked for information. As a result, he has made freedom of information requests and taken NIST to court, <a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20231003-countcorrectly.html">forcing it to reveal details of the NSA’s involvement</a>.</p>
<p>Documents released to Bernstein indicate that a group described as the “Post Quantum Cryptography Team, National Institute of Standards and Technology” included many NSA&nbsp;members and that NIST had met with someone from the UK’s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the UK&nbsp;equivalent of the NSA.</p>

    
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Woodward_(computer_scientist)">Alan Woodward</a> at the University of Surrey, UK, says there are reasons to be wary of encryption algorithms. For example, the GEA-1 code used in mobile phone networks during the 1990s and 2000s was found to have a flaw that made it <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2281423-flaw-in-old-mobile-phone-encryption-code-could-be-used-for-snooping/">millions of times less computationally intensive than it&nbsp;should have been to crack</a>&nbsp;– although a culprit who put it there&nbsp;has never been identified.</p>
<p>But Woodward says that the current PQC candidates have been heavily scrutinised by academics and industry and haven’t yet been&nbsp;found lacking, while other algorithms that featured in earlier stages of the competition have been <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2310369-encryption-meant-to-protect-against-quantum-hackers-is-easily-cracked/">demonstrated to be flawed and were eliminated.</a></p>
<p>“Intelligence agencies have a history of weakening encryption, but there’s been such a lot of security analysis done on these candidates that I would be surprised if Kyber were somehow booby-trapped,” he says.</p>

Yes. One mind-blowing </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-rent-increase-realpage-rent" rel="">story</a><span> from ProPublica that came out in 2022 was about landlord software sold by a firm called RealPage, which essentially told big landlords to raise rents by showing them “data RealPage gathers from clients, including private information on what nearby competitors charge.” There’s a quasi-consulting arrangement here too, as “RealPage discourages bargaining with renters and has even recommended that landlords in some cases accept a lower occupancy rate in order to raise rents and make more money.”</span></p><p><span>RealPage is now facing at least </span><a href="https://therealdeal.com/texas/2022/11/22/realpage-could-face-real-trouble-with-antitrust-suits/" rel="">seven private antitrust class action</a><span> suits, as lower output and higher prices are classic signs of monopoly power. What’s fascinating is that here again, an economist would look at these markets and see competition and multiple rivals renting out apartments, but they would miss that there’s a cartel, or rather a set of regional cartels coordinated by a software platform, operating to boost prices and margins.</span></p><p>Sometimes the price-fixing is done through software and data exchange, and sometimes it’s done through signaling in concentrated markets. In its recently filed complaint against Amazon, for instance, the Federal Trade Commission touched on something called Project Nessie, an internal algorithm “to test how much it could raise prices in a way that competitors would follow.” Amazon would raise a price to see if competitors followed, and then keep the price high if they did, or drop it back down if they didn’t. </p><p>Basically, Amazon wasn’t just hiking its own prices, it was signaling to rivals that they should hike their prices as well. I spoke with a former Amazon retail division official, who told me about how much they hated Project Nessie internally, because it was a collusive mechanism imposed upon the retail division which drove up prices to consumers. </p><p>From a legal perspective, it’s interesting the Federal Trade Commission didn’t make a monopolization claim on Project Nessie, but an argument that this kind of algorithmic collusion is what is known as an unfair method of competition, which is a more expansive claim that allows for a looser market definition. In certain areas, like selling expensive cameras, people do comparison-shop. But even though there is competition, Amazon has market power, and Project Nessie is an unfair exploitation of that market power to drive up prices everywhere. It’s a cartel done via algorithm. </p><p><span>I suspect these forms of coordination are far more common than we assume. You might think the restaurant industry is competitive, and it is. But the </span><em>payment </em><span>software for restaurants is much less so, and when consumers are presented with a bill at a restaurant, the screen regularly offers not the traditional 15% tip, but the choice of tipping 20%, 22%, or 25%. Is that collusion? No. But’s a loosely coordinated form of a price hike to allow firms to pay employees less than they would ordinarily have to. And tipping is now being baked into all sorts of firms, </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tipping-businesses-cant-stop-asking-cc1aca6c" rel="">from</a><span> juice shops to appliance-repair firms to plant stores to locksmiths. 16% of small businesses now ask customers to leave a tip, up from 6% in 2019. Again, this change is almost certainly a shift in the software firms use to accept payments, and it’s a price hike and form of coordination you won’t see in concentration statistics.</span></p><p>That said, even if you think forms of price fixing are systemic, there’s another important question. Did this kind of coordination increase during the pandemic and drive inflation? And there, the answer is we just don’t know. Project Nessie ended in 2019, when the House Antitrust Subcommittee began investigating Amazon. Agri Stats changed some of its practices in 2019 as well, after there were class action suit filings. I find it hard to believe Amazon and meatpackers aren’t continuing these practices in some form or fashion. Moreover, competition is cumulative, and so is collusion. If a bunch of firms have collectively held back on supply for years, they can’t suddenly build a bunch of factories to expand production. In other words, if an industry is historically concentrated, collusive and genteel, then prices won’t move very much for a while, even if formal agreements stop.</p><p><span>Indeed, Mike Konczal and Niko Lusiani, in a paper titled “</span><a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/RI_PricesProfitsPower_202206.pdf" rel="">Prices, Profits, and Power</a><span>,” showed how markups exploded during the pandemic, and that the increases in 2021 were “both the highest level on record and the largest one-year increase—over 2.5 times the increase of the next several largest annual increases.” Was that a function of more single firms operating as monopolies, or more concentrated industries colluding to act as cartels? The answer is likely, yes.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png" width="1194" height="588" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:588,&quot;width&quot;:1194,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>More broadly, price-fixing isn’t always about driving prices up, it can also be about driving wages and supplier prices down.

Indeed, the decade of the 2010s was one in which there was remarkably slow wage growth, which is consistent with a story of heavy concentration on the labor side (which economists have now </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24147" rel="">realized is pervasive</a><span>.)</span></p><p>It was only when there was a broad narrative shift towards inflation that businesses began increasing prices dramatically, and that’s when price-fixing turns from pressing down prices from workers and sellers and towards raising prices on consumers. It isn’t ironclad that profits drove inflation, but these cases do suggest that statistics about concentration are at best incomplete. </p><p>One of the core political dynamics in American politics is that our economic and political elites see the world almost entirely differently than normal people, and there’s no better case study for this than inflation. It’s something I’ve written about extensively - why do Americans think inflation is up and the economy is bad when all the dials and data policymakers use show that these are boom times?</p><p><span>I’ve answered part of this question by showing that the dials themselves </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/strikes-and-bidenomics" rel="">are broken</a><span>, that the cost of interest charges isn’t included in inflation metrics. But I also have a suspicion that the increase of tips and </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/whos-to-blame-for-all-those-hidden-fees-we-are-95d42f6" rel="">junk fees</a><span> - which are exploding in usage by businesses - is causing people to say inflation is too high, not just because everything is so costly but because the prices are also </span><em>unfair</em><span>. </span></p><p>Buying a ticket to a game or concert and seeing a crazy fee, or being presented with a tip screen for a locksmith and having to choose between social awkwardness and paying a higher price, feels crappy. Being cheated is not only frustrating, it’s also scary, because it can recur without warning and cause unexpected costs. Being cheated thus imposes a real extra cost beyond the amount someone has to pay, which is to say, increasing uncertainty about future prices.</p><p>So this is another part of the answer about why sentiments on the economy are negative despite evidence of less inflation and more jobs. Pollsters are asking about inflation by framing it in terms that economists understand, which is to say the level or the rate of increase. But ordinary people not only want to pay good prices, they also want to feel like they are being treated fairly. If people feel increasingly cheated, and the only questions they are asked by pollsters are whether the economy is good or whether inflation is up, they will give an answer that reflects their anger and fear of being taken advantage of, and not reflect the ‘objective’ statistics policymakers expect.</p><p>This too is not a new problem. For thousands of years, political philosophers have wrestled with the problem of the ‘just price’ for goods, and every society regulated prices to get close to fairness. Indeed, the Federal Trade Commission, and many other areas of government, have statutes that bar “unfair” methods of competition or “unfair” consumer pricing practices, because fairness, not just the level, is something that makes a society function. These kinds of laws seem quaint today, and antitrust lawyers and economists regularly mock the very concept of fairness. But by airbrushing out the human element of commerce, and narrowing the only moral question to efficiency and price level, economists have destroyed the ability of policymakers to see commerce and understand the economy the way the rest of us do.</p><p><span>Thanks for reading!

Definitely an odd choice, the reasoning framework gives, is so you don’t disconnect the motherboard while the system is on and input cover is off, but the foam can get moved slightly and the switch won’t trigger.</p><p><strong>The build quality and ability to swap ports at any time is amazing</strong><span>. One thing I can’t stand on my mac is the keyboard getting dirty over time. With this I can take it off and spray air out of it, instead of into it, like on a Mac.</span></p><p>I do wish they had a way to fit 3 ports on each side, like the upcoming 16in version, but 4 is good enough, and I have two extra ports on my desk in case I need them.</p><p>After installing Ubuntu, you have to swap out the kernel and update grub, not really a big deal and it’s pretty straight forward if you are already a software dev. For regular people however, I can see this stuff starting to get complicated, in which case, I recommend just using Windows.</p><p>Windows works great. I know because I have already installed Windows, Ubuntu, and Fedora as you will see later in this post…</p><p>This wasted hours of my time.

The solution is a newer firmware, or a downgrade from what I could tell by reading the forums.</p><p>It seemed simple enough… Use the fwupd tool to update it.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, these 2-3 simple commands that are supposed to first, list your devices, and then install a new firmware, didn’t work, and didn’t work in a super annoying way.</p><p>It would tell me a usb device is busy (I was sure to unplug all ports from the framework) and then just hang. That device ID matched the fingerprint reader. So I didn’t see how to disconnect that without being unable to do an update. The daemon for fwupd froze up so bad that a reboot gets stuck for 5 minutes until that service dies.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://zach.codes/p/a-developers-review-framework-13/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://zach.codes/p/a-developers-review-framework-13/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p><strong>So after wasting an hour, I decided to install Fedora.

Because framework mentioned Fedora 39 having better support, and no need for a custom kernel.</p><p>Surely, the fwupd stuff would work there?</p><p>Nope, the same exact problem with it claiming some usb device was busy and I could not upgrade the firmware.</p><p><strong>Finally, I decided to install windows 11 (LOL)</strong></p><p>At this point, I made the iso, didn’t put a product key in, and booted it.</p><p>Went and downloaded the Framework driver bundle. </p><p>Thankfully I had a compatible usb c → ethernet dongle, because wifi doesn’t work in windows out of the box on this new chipset, so that I could download the bundle!</p><p><strong>IT WORKED</strong></p><p>Sure enough, the windows driver bundle put the sensor on a working firmware.</p><p>I re-installed Ubuntu because I didn’t think to dual boot at the time, and the sensor worked perfectly. </p><p>Problem solved, never give up. </p><p>Coming from a Mac it’s just insane that Framework, but really, Linux in general, has such poor support.</p><p><strong>One huge annoyance is that I can no longer two finger swipe back and forth in a web browser. </strong><span>These little things stack up and make it very hard to use as a primary machine once you are used to such high quality gesture recognition.</span></p><p>In addition I have to press much harder to click on the trackpad, and tap to click just doesn’t work as well as a Mac.</p><p>Above everything, the trackpad gesture issues are the biggest problem I have been facing on my way to daily driving linux.</p><p>Update: I learned that a “new” window manager, called Wayland, is supported by firefox and chrome, but it isn’t on by default in Ubuntu 22.04.3 for firefox.</p><p>I was able to enable it and now I can swipe back and forth. Strangely enough, system freezes happen more frequently for the first 10-15 minutes after booting and having the browser open, then they are happening rarely again. A known issue that will be fixed soon in an upcoming kernel according to the framework team.</p><p>For modern apps not using Wayland…. full gesture support, fractional scaling, etc doesn’t work.</p><p>After fixing firefox, I noticed Slack was incredibly fuzzy…. it doesn’t use Wayland. The only option seem to be spending hours trying to find how to enable every random app, or disable fractional scaling and have a hard time reading stuff because it’s a bit small.</p><p>I was able to go back to 100%, and then increase the gnome font scaling to 1.5 as a middle ground for now.</p><p>I started using this to write this post at night, and I like things dark. I am able to turn off the keyboard light, enable dark mode, yet this fingerprint sensor has a bright light that cannot be turned off. </p><p>I reached out in the forums about this and it seems there should be a way, but it’s not supported on AMD devices as of this writing: https://community.frame.work/t/amd-turn-off-fingerprint-reader-light/37753/4</p><p>If I am on an airplane at night I don’t want to be distracted by light coming from my keyboard area.</p><p>Last thing I tried, was a speed test… Then I realized, this laptop isn’t using the 6ghz band on my router. I own a Pixel 6a, iPhone 15 pro, and a couple other things with 6ghz support, which all work fine. </p><p>For some reason Ubuntu just says 2.4, and 5ghz are available. Framework support requested that I send them proof and some other stuff, but I honestly wonder if any of them have had a chance to test the 6ghz band in linux.</p><p>Don’t really have time after my exhaustion of all the other issues to send them a detailed report on that just yet, haha.</p><p>Update: Turns out, this was due to having band steering on in my router.</p><p>Pixel devices, iPhone 15’s, etc, all can use 6ghz with this setting on, but not the framework, it seems to… steer itself, to 5ghz haha.</p><p>After turning it off, it likes to go onto 2.4GHZ even when I’m close to the router… very frustrating to have such crappy speeds because the wifi firmware is so bad.</p><p>When band steering is off and you are 1 inch from the router, it will sometimes negotiate a 6ghz connection, even when it manages to, the speeds are absolute crap, for some reason this wifi card really sucks in linux. A small pixel 6a right next to it can do 1gigabit in a speed test while this laptop is lucky to get 300 down.</p><p>Disconnect and reconnect, and sometimes you will get 5 ghz, or 2.4, when every other device I have from this next test location has a -60dbm 5ghz connection. Very weird and I hope AMD is working on it.</p><p>1Password has official support for fingerprint readers in Linux, however it doesn’t work and I am working with them to find out why.</p><p><span>Update: The framework team made a </span><a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/en_us/ubuntu-fingerprint-troubleshooting-r1_DA0TMn" rel="">new fingerprint guide</a><span> and at the bottom is a command you must run to enable the fingerprint reader for these other tasks. NOW it works with 1Password!</span></p><p>I have a project running in a VS Code dev container. I noticed that a local app started hanging, loads forever in the browser through the forwarded port.</p><p>This seems to happen after leaving the lid closed for a while and then coming back. Simply re-opening the dev container seems to solve it, and the http requests go through again.</p><p>A known problem in the current kernel, sometimes the system freezes for 1-15s at a time, but it seems to be happening less often the longer you have kept the device on since a restart, and a new kernel is on the way with fixes I hope.</p><p>It can run games, but woah, do the fans spin up. I was able to briefly run Rocket League on windows at the native resolution of the display, it quickly dropped to around 30fps with a lot of drops, so you would definitely want to use AMD FSR compatible games, or drop the render resolution to 1080p or lower.</p><p>Update:</p><p>I found a setting in the bios about game mode on the GPU and enabled it. Starting rocket league again, it’s able to nearly lock 60fps at the screen’s native resolution.</p><p>I also went and connected it via hdmi while on battery to a 1080p display, and it runs games great at this resolution, the fans aren’t even that loud!</p><p>Overall performance seems on par with Apple Silicon.

            <p>Scrollbars. Ever heard of them? They’re pretty cool. Click and drag on a scrollbar and you can move content around in a scrollable content pane. I love that shit. Every day I am scrolling on my computer, all day long. But the scrollbars are getting smaller and this is increasingly becoming a problem. I would show you screenshots but they’re so small that even screenshotting them is hard to do. And people keep making them even smaller, hiding them away, its like they don’t want you to scroll! “Ah”, they say, “that’s what the scroll wheel is for”. My friend, not everyone can use a scroll wheel or a swipe up touch screen. And me, a happy scroll-wheeler, even I would like to quickly jump around some time.</p>

<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h2>

<p>Ok so a lot of folks have fine motor control problems. Others use somewhat inaccurate pointing devices like eye-trackers (they’re very impressive, but not good enough for your 8 pixel wide scrollbar!!). And these people, they wanna scroll! When my friend is voice/sound controlling their computer (<a href="https://talonvoice.com/">with Talon Voice which is really good btw you should try it</a>), they don’t wanna say “scroll down” over and over again or start auto scrolling and try to land in the right spot. They wanna just look at the scrollbar and click on the spot they wanna be looking at. You click on the spot and the content goes there! It’s THE GOOD STUFF!!!</p>

<p>I am not the first to notice this. See <a href="https://www.remembertheusers.com/2015/10/0014-gtk3-scroll-bar-widths.html">this post too in <strong>2015</strong> discussing this problem</a>. I’d hate to go back in time only to tell them nothing has improved.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The simple fact that these skinny scroll bars exist are evidence that designers do not sit with non technical users to conduct usability testing. Because if they did that they would immediately discover the problem.</p>

  <p>People with dexterity and hand control challenges have a difficult time with these skinny scroll bars.</p>

  <p>People with eye sight challenges suffer with these skinny scroll bars.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-problems">The Problems</h2>

<p>People keep making the bar smaller! Or trying to get rid of it! I’m naming names of software I use day to day, but it’s not just them, people are doing this even outside the world of Linux.</p>

<p>In some of the cases the problem is actually that the bar is precisely the same size it always has been (in pixels), but monitor resolutions are much higher than when that bar width was first chosen, and bars haven’t started scaling to keep up, but in other cases the bars are actually getting smaller. Gods, remember the needle-bar Ubuntu tried to introduce for a bit? lmao.</p>

<p>And while the bars were shrinking, another feature silently disappeared: buttons to click and hold down to scroll left/right in increments. Arrow-keys largely hold this functionality now, but are dependent on what content is in focus. Buttons were not dependent on this. Actually, some of you might not even know what I’m talking about. These:</p>

<p><img src="https://artemis.sh/assets/posts/2023-10-12/barbuttons-fs8.png" alt="OS X screenshot with the scroll buttons highlighted"></p>

<p>I don’t use these! But I added it into this post on request of someone who does, and wants them back.</p>

<p>By and large the trend that persists is, the bars get less usable, and either there are no user-configurable ways to fix them, or the ability to configure the options are buried so deep into the tech stack that no normal user can find them. I’m extremely technical. Many of my friends are not, and it’s their troubles that have driven me to write this post.</p>

<h3 id="gtk">GTK</h3>

<p>In GTK2, you could modify scrollbar widths directly in your gtkrc, and GUI programs existed to do this. In GTK3, this is CSS. Which, OK I guess, but there hasn’t really been a good user-friendly way to set it unless you understand theming. I found <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gnome/comments/13i6l2n/custom_application_to_change_scrollbarslider_width/">this reddit thread</a> with a good script for it, which I’ll reproduce here in the likely event that reddit dies. Put this in a <code>.sh</code> file and run it if you need.</p>

<div><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

echo "NEW SCROLLBAR WIDTH(px) OR TYPE 'r' TO RESET"
while true; do
    read uin
    uin=$(echo "$uin" | xargs) # trim
    uin=$(echo "${uin,,}") # lower case

    if [[ "$uin" =~ ^[1-9][0-9]?$ || "$uin" == "r" ]]; then

        # RESET

        # remove previous width in gtk.css (if any)
        if [ -f "$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css" ]; then
            if [[ $(grep -v "slider { min-width" "$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css") ]]; then
                grep -v "slider { min-width" "$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css" &gt; tmpfile &amp;&amp; mv tmpfile "$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css"
            else
                rm "$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css"
            fi
        fi
        if [ -f "$HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css" ]; then
            if [[ $(grep -v "slider { min-width" "$HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css") ]]; then
                grep -v "slider { min-width" "$HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css" &gt; tmpfile &amp;&amp; mv tmpfile "$HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css"
            else
                rm "$HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css"
            fi
        fi

        # reset scrollbar visibility
        gsettings reset org.gnome.desktop.interface overlay-scrolling

        # reset flatpak overrides
        if [[ "$(flatpak --version 2&gt;&amp;1)" =~ ^Flatpak ]] &amp;&amp; [ -f "$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global" ]; then
            sed -i 's|xdg-config/gtk-3.0;||g' "$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global"
            sed -i 's|xdg-config/gtk-4.0;||g' "$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global"
            # if the those were the only filesystem overrides, remove the filesystems= line
            grep -vx "filesystems=" "$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global" &gt; tmpfile &amp;&amp; mv tmpfile "$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global"
            # if there are no other overrides, remove the flatpak global overrides file
            if [[ ! $(grep -vx "\[Context\]" "$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global") ]]; then
                rm "$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global"
            fi
        fi

        # APPLY NEW SETTINGS

        if [[ "$uin" =~ ^[1-9][0-9]?$ ]]; then
            # add new width in gtk.css
            echo "slider { min-width: ${uin}px; min-height: ${uin}px; }" &gt;&gt; "$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css"
            echo "slider { min-width: ${uin}px; min-height: ${uin}px; }" &gt;&gt; "$HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css"

            # apply to flatpak (if installed)
            if [[ "$(flatpak --version 2&gt;&amp;1)" =~ ^Flatpak ]]; then
                flatpak override --user --filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-3.0 --filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-4.0
            fi

            # make scrollbar always visible
            gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface overlay-scrolling false
        fi

        echo "LOGOUT FOR EVERYTHING TO BE APPLIED"
        read hold
        exit 0
    else
        echo "Invalid input, try again."
    fi
done
</code></pre></div>

<p>Naturally the script has to override flatpak separately because heaven forbid my flatpak applications look the way I themed my system. They’ve also started hiding the scrollbar entirely by default until you hover over where it’s supposed to be, what is that???? You can get it back in GTK 3 if you know the right command line command to type in. (the script above does this too btw)</p>

<div><pre><code>gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface overlay-scrolling false
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or you can find it in the GUI if you know how to navigate the Dconf Editor, I guess. lol. Though in GTK 4, you can’t even set this setting globally. See <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=790677#c6">this thread right here</a>, which to the best of my knowledge is still true as of writing.</p>

<div><pre><code>&gt; &gt; Who ever said they were going to "go"? The API to make an application use
&gt; &gt; them is still there. Programs used frequently on tablets or such can take
&gt; &gt; feature requests to have their own options to use non-overlay scrollbars.
&gt; 
&gt; So I just need to file a feature request against every gtk application that I
&gt; use?
&gt; And when I install GNOME I'll need to go into each application and enable it.
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="qt">Qt</h3>

<p>To quote <code>/u/cfeck_kde</code> on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/qmb1kp/how_to_change_scrollbar_width_in_kde_qt_apps/">/r/kde</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The width of Qt scrollbars is determined by the Qt widget style plugin you are using. As far as I know, only the Skulpture style allows configurable sizes. For other styles like Breeze, you would need to change the C++ source and recompile.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the one paw, <em>recompile my GUI theme?</em> - but hey I’m a gentoo user I do that every friday anyway, I could just drop a patch in I guess… <strong>RECOMPILE MY GUI THEME??</strong></p>

<p>I repeat,</p>

<p><img src="https://artemis.sh/assets/posts/2023-10-12/fault-tolerance-crop-crop-fs8.png" alt="One person asks another 'did you just tell me to go fuck myself'? The other person replies 'I believe I did, bob!'"></p>

<p>But on the other paw, because Qt style plugins are <em>real code</em> they do get to have a lot more power here if you find one that lets you change what you want. I use <a href="https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum">Kvantum</a> personally. I can’t seem to find a setting in its configuration to change scrollbar width, but I <em>can</em> disable scrollbar disappearing (which it calls “Transient scrollbars”) so that’s nice.</p>

<p>Anyways, I tried out <a href="https://github.com/atolstoy/skulpture">Skulpture</a> like the reddit person recommended and it seems kinda cool, give it a try! I can’t figure out a way to configure it with a GUI though without using KDE Plasma though. No shade on Plasma, I just don’t have it installed right now to try it out, but maybe if you’re a plasma user it’ll be good for you.</p>

<p>Still, if our only hope is this one theme engine that may or may not keep working as Qt development continues, I can’t help but feel like the war is being lost.</p>

<h3 id="firefox">Firefox</h3>

<p>Firefox has also joined the war on scrollbars it seems, with an incredibly tiny scrollbar on the side of my screen. Thankfully, Firefox is at least fixable (for now…), but you have to go into <code>about:config</code> to do it which is never a great sign. HOWEVER, you CAN do it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Type in <code>about:config</code> in your address bar</li>
  <li>Search for <code>widget.non-native-theme.scrollbar.size.override</code></li>
  <li>Edit it to whatever number you want</li>
  <li>You can also edit <code>widget.non-native-theme.scrollbar.style</code> to change the shape of it, set it to <code>4</code> for a nice chonk rectangle</li>
  <li>Finally, turn on “Always show scrollbars” in the normal settings window <code>about:settings</code> if you want them always on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, I set the size to 50. I don’t want it this big myself but by goly am I glad I can make it this big anyway. Behold, scrollbar glory:</p>

<p><img src="https://artemis.sh/assets/posts/2023-10-12/glory-fs8.png" alt="the scrollbar is HUGE"></p>

<h3 id="chrome">Chrome</h3>

<p>Imagine being able to configure anything useful in chrome ever.</p>

<h3 id="electron">Electron</h3>

<p>For that matter, imagine configuring an <strong>Electron app</strong>. Couldn’t be me. Or anyone else, for that matter. Maybe you can inject some custom CSS into the electron app to fix things up? Honestly if you have solutions for Chrome or Electron please tell me because I have no idea.</p>

<h3 id="there-are-more">THERE ARE MORE</h3>

<p>Look these are just the ones I encounter regularly, but all of these so-called “modern design principles” seem to be in a war against scrollbars and everyone that uses computers slightly different from the people implementing this are suffering as a consequence. Shit sucks yo!</p>

<h2 id="the-best">The Best</h2>

<p>OK you know what rules though? You know what I love, what my friend who uses eye trackers loves, what my friends who use tablet pens love? MINIMAPS</p>

<p><img src="https://artemis.sh/assets/posts/2023-10-12/minimap-fs8.png" alt="big rectangle with content"></p>

<p>YEAH!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I can <em>see the content</em>. I can <em>click the content</em>. I can <em>go to the content</em>. And the hit target is <em>massive</em>. What more could a girl want?</p>

<p>Eliminate the highest paid, and usually highest performing, employees and replace them with part time high schoolers, college students and retirees. </p>

<p>CompUSA, Staples, Circuit City, Bed Bath and Beyond and Best Buy have or did this. And all those retailers are in major trouble or out of business. </p>

<p>When Circuit City eliminated commission sales people their sales tanked.</p>

<p>Pricing across all retailers, both online only or offline + online, is instantly available. The only way to compete is on your listed value adds. </p>

<p>They have already trained much of their customer base that they <em>will</em> try to compete on price by having constant sales. </p>

<p>But adding the above benefits costs money and will cut into profit margins that online only stores don't have to deal with. So you have to then compete on volume, by building loyalty via those above means and doing it really well... it seems like they are trying to nickel and dime their way out of providing that level of quality, putting them into a tough spot.</p>

<p>Unions are about giving employees a seat at the table. The absolute only reason companies don't want their employees to organize is because very few will actually stand up for themselves. The ones that do are easily eliminated. It's much more difficult for them to do that to a whole bargaining unit.</p>

<p>Don't let them fool you into believing they can't afford to pay employees better or give them better benefits. They absolutely can. They just want to see those profits increase more and more.</p>

So for 2023, they say "we want to make 3 million this year!" and they only make 2.5 million, suddenly we've fallen "short". I'd love to actually see their numbers. </p>

<p>I'm interested to see how much longer they're going to be willing to give members the whole 10% reward. I give it two or three years <em>max</em> before it gets the chop.</p>

<p>Oh, and I'm sure no one on the board was cut, or got any sort of paycuts. If they keep chopping at the roots, their tree is going to topple much faster than they're expecting.</p>

<p>Ha ha! I had a man come in with a return of an osprey exos… he had the large/extra large and his torso was a 17… strike one… Then I asked him as I fit him into other packs, (after measuring him) what was his base weight. I was specific and said, no food or water, just the stuff you normally bring. He said 35lbs… strike 2 for the Exos… and lastly he was a large man around. A 46 inch waist and the osprey was never designed for that body type… 5’6” 300 lbs and a 17 inch torso… strike 3. </p>

<p>He said he came in, but when I did the exchange it was an online order… almost all of his purchases were online and he was buying all sorts of stuff not suitable for where he says he had hiked.</p>

<p>by the time he left, we had him sorted out and he kept saying… I should have come in first! (Remember he told me that he had been in and fit for this pack)</p>

<p>my guess is that the return policy will become even stricter and mostly member based. That old timers like me will stick around because we are still conditioned to the old ways and like the customer interaction. And the new people will be less and less knowledgeable and more and more unskilled.</p>

<p>and pay will be flat for a long time, until they can make up for all the concessions that they have given in the past 6-7 years.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pairings like that between automorphic forms and Galois groups are called dualities. They suggest that different classes of objects mirror each other, which allows mathematicians to study either one in terms of the other.</p>
<p>Generations of mathematicians have worked to prove the existence of Langlands’ hypothesized duality. Though they have only managed to establish it for limited cases, even those limited cases have often yielded spectacular results. For example, in 1994, when Andrew Wiles showed that Langlands’ proposed duality holds for a particular class of examples, the result was his proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem, among the most celebrated results in the history of mathematics.</p>
<p>As mathematicians have pursued the Langlands program, they have also expanded it in many directions.</p>
<p>One such line has been to study dualities between arithmetic objects that are related to, but distinct from, the ones Langlands was interested in. In their 2012 book, Sakellaridis and Venkatesh studied a duality between periods, which are closely related to automorphic forms, and <em>L</em>-functions, which are infinite sums that attach to Galois groups. From a mathematical point of view, periods and <em>L</em>-functions are entirely different species of objects with no obvious common traits.</p>

<p>Periods emerged as objects of mathematical interest in the work of Erich Hecke in the 1930s.</p>
<p><em>L</em>-functions are infinite sums that have been used since the work of Leonhard Euler in the mid-18th century to investigate basic questions about numbers. The most famous <em>L</em>-function, the Riemann zeta function, is at the heart of the Riemann hypothesis, which can be viewed as a prediction about how prime numbers are distributed. The <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-i-learned-to-love-and-fear-the-riemann-hypothesis-20210104/">Riemann hypothesis</a> is arguably the most important unsolved problem in math.</p>
<p>Langlands was aware of possible connections between <em>L</em>-functions and periods, but he viewed them as a secondary matter in his scheme of joining different areas of math.</p>
<p>“In one paper, [Langlands] considered this study of periods and <em>L</em>-functions as something not worth studying,” Sakellaridis said.</p>
<h2><strong>Welcome to the Machine</strong></h2>
<p>Though Robert Langlands did not emphasize the connection between periods and <em>L</em>-functions,&nbsp; Sakellaridis and Venkatesh viewed them as central to broadening and deepening the connections between seemingly distant areas of mathematics that Langlands had proposed.</p>
<p>In their 2012 book, they developed a machine of sorts, which took a period as an input, performed a long computation, and output an <em>L</em>-function. Not all periods produce corresponding <em>L</em>-functions, though, and the main theoretical advance of their book was to understand which ones do. (This built on earlier work by Atsushi Ichino and Tamotsu Ikeda at Kyoto University.)</p>
<p>But their approach had two limitations. First, it did not explain why a given period yields a given <em>L</em>-function. The machine that turned one into the other was a black box. It was as if they’d constructed a vending machine that often reliably yielded something to eat each time you put in money, only there was no telling what it would be in advance, or if the machine would eat the money without dispensing a snack.</p>
<p>For any given case, you’d put in your money — your period — then “go and do a long computation and see which among a zoo of <em>L</em>-functions you got,” Venkatesh said.</p>
<p>The second thing they didn’t manage to accomplish in their book was to come to an understanding of which <em>L</em>-functions have associated periods. Some do. Others don’t. They couldn’t figure out why.</p>

<p>They kept working after the book came out, trying to figure out why the connection worked and how to run the machine in both directions — not only getting an <em>L</em>-function from a period, but also the other way around.</p>
<p>In other words, they wanted to know that if they put $1.50 into the vending machine, it meant they were going to get a bag of Cheetos. Moreover, they wanted to be able to tell that if they were holding a bag of Cheetos, it meant they’d put $1.50 into the vending machine.</p>
<p>Because they link objects that, on their face, have nothing in common, dualities are powerful. You could stare at a lineup of mathematical objects forever and not perceive how <em>L</em>-functions and periods match up.</p>
<p>“The way they are defined and given, this period and <em>L</em>-function, there’s no obvious relation,” said <a href="https://discovery.nus.edu.sg/2099-wee-teck-gan">Wee Teck Gan</a> of the National University of Singapore.</p>
<p>To translate between superficially incommensurate things, you need to find common ground. One way to do that for objects like <em>L</em>-functions and periods, which originate in number theory, is to associate them with geometric objects.</p>
<p>To take a toy example, imagine you have a triangle. Measure the length of each side, and you can produce a set of numbers that tells you how to write down an <em>L</em>-function. Look at another triangle, and rather than the lengths, look at the three interior angles — you can use those angles to define a period. So instead of comparing <em>L</em>-functions and periods directly, you can compare their associated triangles. The triangles can be said to “index” the <em>L</em>-functions and periods — if a period matches with a triangle with certain angles, then the lengths of that triangle match up with a corresponding <em>L</em>-function.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>Last week, Matt Barnum reported in Chalkbeat that the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is laying off dozens of staff members and </span><a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/2023/10/4/23903768/mark-zuckerberg-czi-schools-personalized-learning-technology-summit" rel="">pivoting away from the personalized learning platform</a><span> they have funded since 2015 with somewhere near $100M.</span></p><blockquote><p>CZI’s shift in approach marks something of a coda to an era when various advocates and funders believed that computer-based “personalized learning” could dramatically improve education. Summit, CZI’s pet project, has not spread as far as once hoped, and there’s little evidence that it or similar efforts have led to the large learning gains that Zuckerberg envisioned. This gap between ambitions and results underscores the difficulty of using technology to dramatically improve America’s vast system of decentralized schools.</p></blockquote><p><span>On Twitter, the social network where people are particularly sensitive to the hubris of the billionaire class, commenters have received Barnum’s article fairly gleefully. I’d like to go farther than glee, however, and name the </span><em>single</em><span> misunderstanding about education that, more than any other, led Zuckerberg to make this investment which he is now writing down.</span></p><p>This is the Summit model, which I have witnessed firsthand:</p><blockquote><p>Summit also featured 16 hours a week of “personalized learning time.” Students worked at their own pace on a computer, which fed them a “playlist” of content where they learned specific skills. Students could move on once they got eight of 10 questions right on an online quiz.</p><p><span>That seemed to be the biggest draw for Zuckerberg, who contrasted the approach to “</span><strong>having every student sit in a classroom and listen to a teacher explain the same material at the same pace in the same way</strong><span>.” He suggested this could lead to transformational improvements in student learning. The goal, he wrote in 2017, was “scaling this approach to every classroom.”</span></p></blockquote><p>There it is. You see this misunderstanding time and again from the people who influence whatever passes for a national strategy in education technology.</p><p><span>In 2016, for example, the Gates Foundation announced </span><a href="https://usprogram.gatesfoundation.org/news-and-insights/articles/investing-in-the-promise-of-quality-personalized-learning" rel="">a fund for personalized learning</a><span> under the same premise:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>[Personalized learning] allows students to progress through content at their own pace </span><strong>without worrying about being too far behind (or ahead) of their classmates.</strong></p></blockquote><p><span>Sal Khan </span><a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/74-interview-sal-khan-on-personalized-learning-a-global-diploma-and-how-hed-spend-100-million/" rel="">echoed this premise</a><span> in 2018:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>For us, personalization is — and we could talk about the different flavors of personalization that people use out in the world — but for us, it is, </span><strong>you learn at your own time and pace</strong><span>.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>I have tried to illustrate as often as my subscribers will tolerate that students don’t particularly enjoy learning alone with laptops within social spaces like classrooms. </span><a href="https://danmeyer.substack.com/p/why-generative-ai-will-underperform" rel="">That learning fails to answer their questions about their social identity</a><span>. </span><a href="https://danmeyer.substack.com/p/chatbots-have-a-math-problem-and" rel="">It contributes to their feelings of alienation and disbelonging</a><span>. I find this case easy to make but hard to prove. Maybe we just haven’t done personalized learning </span><em>right?</em><span> Maybe Summit just needed to include </span><em>generative AI chatbots</em><span> in their platform?</span></p><p><span>What is far easier to prove, or rather to </span><em>disprove</em><span>, is the idea that “whole class instruction </span><em>must</em><span> feel impersonal to students,” that “whole class instruction </span><em>must necessarily</em><span> fail to meet the needs of individual students.”</span></p><p><span>For that proof, I only need to raise the existence of </span><em>a single classroom</em><span> where the teacher interacts with </span><em>the whole class</em><span> in ways that feel personal and responsive to </span><em>the individual students</em><span>. Here is one of thousands operating daily.</span></p><p><span>In </span><a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/614deb03fdc6eb09ef4adbd5?collections=5fff36c7a65b820b3c57bc64%2C5fff839a8b9eb944c9391501#preview/663d1933-f70c-4817-838b-db101c647a73" rel="">our take on the classic Pool Border problem</a><span>, students eventually write an algebraic equation to represent the number of tiles around a pool of any size.

            <p>Speaking to partners last week as part of their annual Open Innovation Platform forum in Europe, a big portion of TSMC's roadshow was dedicated to the next generation of the company's foundry technology. TSMC's 2 nm-class&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/18832/tsmc-outlines-2nm-plans-n2p-brings-backside-power-delivery-in-2026-n2x-added-to-roadmap">N2</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/18832/tsmc-outlines-2nm-plans-n2p-brings-backside-power-delivery-in-2026-n2x-added-to-roadmap">N2P, and N2X process technologies</a>&nbsp;are set to introduce multiple innovations, including nanosheet gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, backside power delivery, and super-high-performance metal-insulator-metal (SHPMIM) capacitor over the next few years. But in order to take advantage of these innovations, TSMC warns, chip designers will need to use all-new electronic design automation (EDA), simulation, and verification tools as well as IP. And while making such a big shift is never an easy task, TSMC is bringing some good news to chip designers early-on: even with N2 still a couple of years out, many of the major EDA tools, verification tools, foundation IP, and even analog IP for N2 are already available for use.</p>

<p>"For N2 we could be working with them two years in advance already because nanosheet is different," said Dan Kochpatcharin, Head of Design Infrastructure Management at TSMC, at the OIP 2023 conference in Amsterdam. "[EDA] tools have to be ready, so what the OIP did is to work with them early. We have a huge engineering team to work with the EDA partners, IP partners, [and other] partners."</p>

<p><small><em>*Chip density published by TSMC reflects&nbsp;'mixed' chip density consisting of 50% logic, 30% SRAM, and 20% analog.&nbsp;</em></small></p>

<p>Preparations for the start of N2 chip production, scheduled for sometime in the second half of 2025, began long ago. Nanosheet GAA transistors behave differently than familiar FinFETs, so EDA and other tool and IP makers had to build their products from scratch. This is where TSMC's Open Innovation Platform (OIP) demonstrated its prowess and enabled TSMC's partners to start working on their products well in advance.</p>

<p>By now, major EDA tools from Cadence and Synopsys as well as many tools from Ansys and Siemens EDA have been certified by TSMC, so chip developers can already use them to design chips. Also, EDA software programs from Cadence and Synopsys are ready for analog design migration. Furthermore, Cadence's EDA tools already support N2P's backside power delivery network.</p>

<p>With pre-built IP designs, things are taking a bit longer. TSMC's foundation libraries and IP, including standard cells, GPIO/ESD, PLL, SRAM, and ROM are ready both for mobile and high-performance computing applications. Meanwhile, some PLLs exist in pre-silicon development kits, whereas others are silicon proven. Finally, blocks such as non-volatile memory, interface IP, and even chiplet IP are not yet available - bottlenecking some chip designs - but these blocks in active development or planned for development by companies like Alphawave, Cadence, Credo, eMemory, GUC, and Synopsys, according to a TSMC slide. Ultimately, the ecosystem of tools and libraries for designing 2 nm chips is coming together, but it's not all there quite yet.</p>

<p>"[Developing IP featuring nanosheet transistors] is not harder, but it does take more cycle time, cycle time is a bit longer," said Kochpatcharin. "Some of these IP vendors also need to be trained [because] it is just different. To go from planar [transistor] to FinFET, is not harder, you just need to know how to do the FinFET. [It is] same thing, you just need to know how to do [this]. So, it does take some to be trained, but [when you are trained], it is easy. So that is why we started early."</p>

<p>Although many of the major building blocks for chips are N2-ready, a lot of work still has to be done by many companies before TSMC's 2 nm-class process technologies go into mass production. Large companies, which tend to design (or co-design) IP and development tools themselves are already working on their 2 nm chips, and should be ready with their products by the time mass production starts in 2H 2025. Other players can also fire up their design engines because 2 nm preps are well underway at TSMC and its partners.</p>

	<p>12 Oct 2023</p>
	<p>Recently, Valve announced that Counter-Strike 2 would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/valve-confirms-counter-strike-2-no-macos/">no longer support macOS</a>. As a one-man indie developer who has released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574000/Industry_Idle/">a game supporting macOS</a>, I find myself at first surprised at Valve’s decision. But after looking back at my own journey of supporting six platforms, I feel I can understand Valve’s perspective.</p>

<p>I feel it is beneficial to write down some of my “lessons learned”, hopefully, that will help fellow indie developers choose which platforms to support. A bit of background, my own game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574000/Industry_Idle/">Industry Idle</a> is mostly built on web technologies (WebGL + TypeScript). This means supporting different platforms is comparatively easy - I don’t have to deal with platform-specific graphics APIs (DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal) and I mostly live inside the browser sandbox. This is pretty much the sunny day scenario when it comes to cross-platform support. Yet, I am constantly surprised and plagued by platform-specific issues.</p>

<h2 id="web">Web</h2>

<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>

<p>If I am asked to choose a “first-class” platform for Industry Idle, it would be the web. During development, I am running the game in my web browser. So supporting the web is pretty much “automatic”. The platform itself does not need much hassle: I can easily set up an automated build pipeline that deploys to Github/CloudFlare pages, which is mostly free.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>

<p>As a platform to release a game, the web platform is very saturated. There are a few portal websites left but they are geared towards a very casual audience, who would not play a hard-core factory builder and economy simulation game. The web version makes very little money. If Industry Idle is written without web-first support, I would probably not port the game to the web at all.</p>

<h3 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h3>

<p>It is very easy to cheat on the web - after all, the nice development and debug tooling that I enjoy also makes cheating very easy. I have to implement a login system (I implemented Steam OpenID login) so that I can ban bad actors - the game has a multiplayer player trade system and a cheater can easily ruin the experience for everyone. Also, it is possible that people will “steal” the game and host it on their website. I am not really bothered by this as long as people playing on those websites do not cheat.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Not much work to support but not many players to gain</strong></p>

<h2 id="windows-steam">Windows (Steam)</h2>

<h3 id="the-good-1">The Good</h3>

<p>Steam is the only storefront where the game is released. I’ve submitted to Epic Game Store as well but never gotten any reply - maybe it is a good thing as integrating another SDK is probably not worth it. In 2023, Windows is still the dominating platform for gamers. About 99% of all desktop players play on Windows. The platform has a relatively stable API - Microsoft almost never breaks backward compatibilities. Setting up an automated build pipeline is relatively easy - I build the Windows version on my Linux server.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad-1">The Bad</h3>

<p>The game uses Electron as the runtime. But in order to integrate with Steam SDK (which is in C++), I have used a few solutions: <a href="https://github.com/greenheartgames/greenworks">greenworks</a> (no longer maintained), Node-API (via <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api">node-addon-api</a>, requires setting up a cross-platform C++ toolchain and write bindings manually), <a href="https://koffi.dev/">Koffi</a> (an FFI module for Node.JS, provides precompiled binaries but requires writing bindings manually) and finally <a href="https://github.com/ceifa/steamworks.js">steamworks.js</a> (calling Steamworks via Rust bindings).</p>

<h3 id="the-ugly-1">The Ugly</h3>

<p>There are relatively few problems compared to the number of players but occasionally I have to deal with really obscure issues like an old Visual C++ Redistributable installed or a “trimmed” version of Windows missing some DLLs. And a lot of Windows players are not tech-savvy, which makes debugging hard. But I cannot really complain about it - looking at the <em>percentage</em> of people who have encountered platform-specific issues, Windows is probably the lowest among desktops.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Not supporting Windows is not an option but luckily it’s relatively easy</strong></p>

<h2 id="macos-steam">macOS (Steam)</h2>

<h3 id="the-good-2">The Good</h3>

<p>When I wrote the first line of code of Industry Idle, I was using a Mac. I’ve been a long-time Mac user and have only migrated to Windows after doing more game dev. Mac accounts for less than 1% of all desktop players but oftentimes people are pleasantly surprised that the game works on Mac and I’ve got several “thank-you” emails about it. Another good thing about the platform is that the x64 build more or less “just works” on Apple Silicon Macs - I don’t have an Apple Silicon Mac and the game only has an x64 build but several “thank-you” emails I’ve got are from Apple Silicon Mac owners - I guess they should really thank Rosetta. Running in emulation mode is not really ideal but the game runs on a potato so the powerful Apple Silicon can easily handle it even with emulation overhead.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad-2">The Bad</h3>

<p>Mac is one of the most problematic platforms, even after Electron handles most of the platform-specifics, there are lots of gotchas:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/hardened_runtime">Code signing</a> with a hardened runtime is almost a must.</li>
  <li>However, Steamworks SDK loads <code>dylib</code>, which requires several <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_cs_disable-library-validation">entitlement exceptions</a>. It’s not well-documented so good luck figuring out which ones. And fingers crossed that Apple will not one day disallow those exceptions.</li>
  <li>After signing the executable, I need to notarize it. The old notarization API takes forever (for a 200MB executable, anywhere between 30 minutes to several hours), fails randomly, and almost never gives meaningful error messages. The new “notarytool” is much improved, but still adds 10mins to the build pipeline. In comparison, the total “Windows + Linux + macOS + upload to Steam” pipeline without code signing and notarization takes about 2-3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Of course, the above has to be done on a Mac (some limited experimental non-Mac support starts to become <a href="https://crates.io/crates/apple-codesign">available</a>), which is notoriously bad for build automation. I have a bunch of hacks like <code>security unlock-keychain</code> in the build script but it still fails occasionally.</li>
  <li>And, keep in mind, this is the <em>sunny day scenario</em>: no platform-specific API porting is needed (like from DirectX/Vulkan to Metal).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-ugly-2">The Ugly</h3>

<p>The economy of supporting Mac as an indie is bleak. A Mac is pretty much needed and they are not cheap. All the revenue from the platform does not even cover 10% of the cheapest Mac Mini. And then there’s the $100 per year developer membership fee for notarization. Luckily it can be used for iOS as well. Also, Apple is more willing to break backward compatibilities. Sometimes there are new macOS/XCode version requirements, which means upgrading the operating system (takes 1-2 hours, can occasionally fail) and XCode (takes 2+ hours, I usually just leave it overnight).</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Not worth the time and money and definitely not worth the pain</strong></p>

<h2 id="linux-including-steam-deck">Linux (Including Steam Deck)</h2>

<h3 id="the-good-3">The Good</h3>

<p>Linux is not picky about hardware - it runs on everything and costs nothing. I run Arch Linux inside a virtual machine on my development machine to test the game. I also run Ubuntu on my build machine to produce the executables. And the server runs on a VPS that runs Debian. Linux is very easy to automate.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad-3">The Bad</h3>

<p>Linux is very saturated and the operating systems come in different shapes and forms. Initially, I struggled to get the game running at all. In fact, even an empty Electron app (from the official example) does not run. And after hours of Googling, adding <code>--no-sandbox</code> argument solves for <em>some</em> users but not for all. This is kind of expected because it is impossible to know what libraries are installed on the OS and which version. I wish Steam would allow me to say “Linux support is provided at a best-effort basis” but that’s not an option - I have to tick the checkbox to provide the Linux build, which sometimes sets the wrong expectation.</p>

<p>After Steam Deck was released, I thought supporting it would be automatic - after all, I have a Linux build - but no. It turns out that unless the game is explicitly marked (by Valve reviewers), Steam Deck will use the Windows build + Proton even if a Linux version is available. And the Linux version is running against <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime">“Steam Runtime”</a> - a relatively fixed set of libraries that developers can target. It is a good solution to the saturated Linux library situation but unfortunately, several libraries are missing to run Electron. To give Valve credit, they are very responsive and helpful in eventually <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime/issues/579">resolving the issue</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-ugly-3">The Ugly</h3>

<p>Linux accounts for less than 1% of the total players, so from a business perspective, it is not worth it. And the platform has the <em>highest</em> percentage of players who run into platform-specific issues - the time used for customer support only makes the economy worse. Also, I don’t own a Steam Deck, so adding support is not always easy: Valve does not provide a SteamOS image to test. So Steam Deck-specific code (like controller support, starting the game in full-screen, making the UI bigger, etc) is not tested end-to-end. I’ve used <a href="https://github.com/HoloISO/holoiso">HoloISO</a> with limited success.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Even worse economy than Mac but less annoyance perhaps</strong></p>

<h2 id="ios">iOS</h2>

<h3 id="the-good-4">The Good</h3>

<p>Industry Idle’s core engine is actually a mobile engine - before Industry Idle, I was mainly making mobile games. However, Industry Idle is a desktop-first game, which means porting to mobile requires quite some UI adjustments. The game runs inside a custom <code>WkWebView</code> on iOS, with some bridging code that exposes native APIs (like Game Center). iOS hardware and software are generally less saturated compared to Android, which means after testing the game on my aging iPhone 6, I have high confidence that the game will work fine on most other iOS devices.</p>

<p>The base game of Industry Idle is free-to-play, with two Expansion Packs available for purchase (one-time purchase, not subscriptions) - the same as Steam. There’s only one optional “reward video” ad that allows a player to double the offline income by watching an ad. The game has no microtransactions - I don’t like mobile games that are full of ads or are very pushy about microtransactions.</p>

<p>iOS is generally a more “premium” mobile platform compared to Android, which means more players have purchased expansion packs compared to Android. Even though iOS accounts for only about 30% of all mobile players. it brings in about 50% of all mobile income. Also a nice side-effect of Apple’s walled garden is that iOS has the lowest <em>percentage</em> of cheaters.</p>

<p>I know there have been lots of complaints about App Review on iOS. I feel the situation has been much improved. Review time is relatively short (1-2 days) and if a reviewer rejects an update for nonsensical grounds, a quick reply usually solves the problem. For example, once an update was rejected for missing a “Restore Purchase” button. I replied by telling the reviewer where to find the button with a screenshot and also <em>gently</em> pointing out the fact that that button had been there since the initial release, which was more than <em>50 releases ago</em>. The update was approved the next day. During the initial release, the game was rejected for “copying an existing game”. It turned out the AppStore reviewer believed I was “pirating” the Steam version of Industry Idle. I ended up putting a secret web page on the official website, telling the reviewer that I was indeed the developer behind the Steam version. The release was timely approved. The fact that AppStore has human reviewers is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, people make mistakes, which causes unnecessary annoyances. On the other hand, it’s easy to talk to an actual human and resolve any issues. Compared to Google Play, which is very machine-driven and is very hard to find a human for solutions.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad-4">The Bad</h3>

<p><code>WkWebView</code> is the only allowed web view on iOS and its update is coupled with the iOS update. Apple stopped supporting the iPhone 6 a while ago, which means it is stuck with iOS 12 and a relatively ancient WkWebView. Luckily most players use a much newer iPhone, which helps with this problem.</p>

<p>Similar to developing for macOS, a Mac is pretty much required for developing for iOS and there’s the $100 per year developer membership fee. I think the combined income of both iOS and macOS (95% of which comes from iOS) barely covers the cost of the membership fee and the cheapest Mac Mini. And presumably an iPhone is needed for testing, which means the game would be running at a loss. Luckily I had my old Macbook and iPhone so I didn’t have to spend that money.</p>

<p>Just like macOS, iOS is not really designed for build automation either. Partially because I have to run it on a Mac, and partially because the automation pipeline is flaky. <a href="https://fastlane.tools/">Fastlane</a> is a tremendous time saver, however, the build will occasionally fail (2FA required or Apple Server down) and require manual intervention. Because of this, I don’t produce iOS or macOS beta builds.</p>

<h3 id="the-ugly-4">The Ugly</h3>

<p>Mobile is generally a very different platform compared to desktop. Even though it has a very large audience, reaching the target audience usually requires paid user acquisition (i.e. spending money to buy ads). I have zero marketing budget: a lot of players learn about the game on other platforms; a lot of players join via their friends (word of mouth); and there was once a spike in downloads which I could only imagine was from AppStore Editorial or algorithm. Since I was never told anything about this, I could not confirm it.</p>

<p>The lack of annoying ads and pushy microtransactions provide a good experience on mobile. However, this means the mobile income is abysmal: it’s a fraction of desktop versions, even though the player amount is much higher.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: 50% of supporting mobile is supporting iOS</strong></p>

<h2 id="android">Android</h2>

<h3 id="the-good-5">The Good</h3>

<p>Android version uses the built-in <code>WebView</code> and Google has been doing a decent job of keeping it up-to-date. Since it is <em>not</em> tied to the OS update, a bigger percentage of players on Android have a relatively recent version. However, the same cannot be said about the operating system itself and hardware, which I will get to later. Android’s automated build pipeline (powered by Fastlane) is much faster and more stable - it runs on Windows, Mac and Linux and the command line has first-class support. Android devices are generally cheaper to acquire - I use Android as my daily phone so extra saving for me! As mentioned before, Google Play uses lots of machine-based checks, which means update review is generally faster (a few hours) if everything goes well.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad-5">The Bad</h3>

<p>Android OS and hardware is a mess! There are lots of different hardware, each can run a different OS version, which can have weird customizations from manufacturers. WebView is in general okay but native APIs are very messy - the same API can behave very differently on different devices (e.g. when display cutout API was first introduced, the adoption was bad and each manufacturer has its own quirkiness). My strategy is simple: I test on my own phone and cross my fingers hoping it will work on other devices.</p>

<p>Also Android has a relatively aggressive API deprecation strategy. Google Play requires a relatively recent <code>targetSdkVersion</code> and would reject an app update if one of the third-party SDKs is deprecated. This means I have to constantly fire up Android Studio and update Android and SDK versions (sometimes Kotlin and Gradle versions as well). The project usually will fail to compile, which means several hours of fixing and testing. This does not happen every day but often enough to be annoying. In comparison, I only have to open XCode and update the native Swift code maybe twice since the initial release.</p>

<h3 id="the-ugly-5">The Ugly</h3>

<p>Android accounts for 70% of all mobile players but the revenue is about the same as iOS. Few people have purchased the expansion packs and most income actually comes from the one and only <em>optional</em> reward video ad. Actually, the ad implementation on Android is probably buggy since it oftentimes does not show up after backgrounding the game until a hard restart - I have got complaints from users about this! However, I never managed to figure out why - partially because I couldn’t reproduce it on my phone and partially because I’d like to spend my time working on the game, not debugging some buggy Ad SDK.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: The other 50% of supporting mobile is supporting Android</strong></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I appreciate that you’ve read through my long rant about platform support as a one-man indie and hopefully, this will help you in your decision-making - I know I will definitely make better choices for <a href="https://www.cividle.com/">my next game</a>. When talking about game development, the boring details above are rarely mentioned, yet they are of vital importance in actually shipping a game and they can take a lot of effort. In fact, apart from doing platform support work, most of my time is spent on customer support, community management, reviewing and banning cheaters, and server maintenance. So much so that the work on my new game is severely delayed. I’ve yet to find a good balance but I am trying my best.</p>

		<p>This blog post centers on a vulnerability that was recently discovered related to the HTTP/2 protocol. Under certain conditions, this vulnerability can be exploited to execute a denial-of-service attack on NGINX Open Source, NGINX Plus, and related products that implement the server-side portion of the HTTP/2 specification. To protect your systems from this attack, we’re recommending an immediate update to your NGINX configuration.</p>
<h3>The Problem with HTTP/2 Stream Resets</h3>
<p>After establishing a connection with a server, the HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to initiate concurrent streams for data exchange. Unlike previous iterations of the protocol, if an end user decides to navigate away from the page or halt data exchange for any other reason, HTTP/2 provides a method for canceling the stream. It does this by issuing an RST_STREAM frame to the server, saving it from executing work needlessly.</p>
<p>The vulnerability is exploited by initiating and rapidly canceling a large number of HTTP/2 streams over an established connection, thereby circumventing the server’s concurrent stream maximum. This happens because incoming streams are reset faster than subsequent streams arrive, allowing the client to overload the server without ever reaching its configured threshold.</p>
<h3>Impact on NGINX</h3>
<p>For performance and resource consumption reasons, NGINX limits the number of concurrent streams to a default of 128 (see <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_v2_module.html#http2_max_concurrent_streams" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http2_max_concurrent_streams</a>). In addition, to optimally balance network and server performance, NGINX allows the client to persist HTTP connections for up to 1000 requests by default using an HTTP keepalive (see <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#keepalive_requests" rel="noopener" target="_blank">keepalive_requests</a>). </p>
<p>By relying on the default keepalive limit, NGINX prevents this type of attack. Creating additional connections to circumvent this limit exposes bad actors via standard layer 4 monitoring and alerting tools.</p>
<p>However, if NGINX is configured with a keepalive that is substantially higher than the default and recommended setting, the attack may deplete system resources. When a stream reset occurs, the HTTP/2 protocol requires that no subsequent data is returned to the client on that stream. Typically, the reset results in negligible server overhead in the form of tasks that gracefully handle the cancellation. However, circumventing NGINX’s stream threshold enables a client to take advantage of this overhead and amplify it by rapidly initiating thousands of streams. This forces the server CPU to spike, denying service to legitimate clients.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/DIAG-NGINX-DoS-Attack-via-HTTP2-streams-1024x738-1.svg" alt="DoS Attack via HTTP2 Streams"><br>
<small><em>Denial-of-service by establishing HTTP/2 streams, followed by stream cancellations under abnormally high keepalive limits.</em></small></p>
<h3>Steps for Mitigating Attack Exposure</h3>
<p>As a fully featured server and proxy, NGINX provides administrators with powerful tools for mitigating denial-of-service attacks. To take advantage of these features, it is essential  that the following updates are made to NGINX configuration files, minimizing the server’s attack surface:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#keepalive_requests" rel="noopener" target="_blank">keepalive_requests</a> should be kept at the default setting of 1000 requests </li>
<li><a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_v2_module.html#http2_max_concurrent_streams" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http2_max_concurrent_streams</a> should be kept at the default setting of 128 streams </li>
</ul>
<p>We also recommend that these safety measures are added as a best practice:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_conn_module.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">limit_conn</a> enforces a limit on the number of connections allowed from a single client. This directive should be added with a reasonable setting balancing application performance and security. </li>
<li><a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_req_module.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">limit_req</a> enforces a limit on the number of requests that will be processed within a given amount of time from a single client. This directive should be added with a reasonable setting balancing application performance and security. </li>
</ul>
<h3>How We’re Responding </h3>
<p>We experimented with multiple mitigation strategies that helped us gain an understanding into how this attack could impact our wide range of customers and users. While this research confirmed that NGINX is already equipped with all the necessary tools to avoid the attack, we wanted to take additional steps to ensure that users who do need to configure NGINX beyond recommended specifications are able to do so.</p>
<p>Our investigation yielded a method for improving server resiliency under various forms of flood attacks that are theoretically possible over the HTTP/2 protocol. As a result, we’ve issued a patch that increases system stability under these conditions. To protect against such threats, we recommend that NGINX Open Source users rebuild binaries from the latest codebase and NGINX Plus customers update to the latest packages (R29p1 or R30p1) immediately.</p>
<h3>How the Patch Works </h3>
<p>To ensure the early detection of flood attacks on NGINX, the patch imposes a limit on the number of new streams that can be introduced within one event loop. This limit is set to twice the value configured using the <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_v2_module.html#http2_max_concurrent_streams" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http2_max_concurrent_streams</a> directive. The limit will be applied even if the maximum threshold is never reached, like when streams are reset right after sending the request (as in the case of this attack).</p>
<h3>Affected Products </h3>
<p>This vulnerability impacts the NGINX HTTP/2 module (<a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_v2_module.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ngx_http_v2_module</a>). For information about your specific NGINX or F5 product that might be affected, please visit: <a href="https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137106" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137106</a>.</p>

These companies are collecting enormous amounts of data — not only can they see user prompts, they also get explicit feedback (thumbs up/thumbs down) as well as implicit feedback (e.g., asking more questions if you didn’t get the answer you wanted). Better yet, they are also at the forefront of customer conversations, understanding where LLM users are pushing the boundaries and where the models fail.</p><p><span>All of this is grist for the mill of future model training, and investment is only accelerating: Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlkk3glap_U" rel="">recently predicted that we’ll have models that cost $10B in 2 years</a><span>.</span></p><p>Model quality is definitely a big advantage, but it’s only a part of the story. The more impressive moat these companies have is the scalability of their infrastructure and the quality of their service. Let’s look at fine-tuning APIs as an illustrative example.</p><p>Our team at RunLLM has been running experiments recently with the GPT fine-tuning API. A single fine-tuning run on GPT-3.5 costs us anywhere from $4-12 dollars and take about 1-1.5 hours to fine-tune over about 1 million tokens.</p><p><span>Meanwhile, a single </span><code>p4d.24xlarge</code><span> on AWS costs $32.77 per-hour on-demand or $19.22 per-hour if you reserve for 1 year. Each machine comes with 8 Nvidia A100 GPUs. Assuming that OpenAI only uses 8 GPUs to fine-tune GPT-3.5, it’s 3-8x cheaper to use OpenAI than it is to rent a </span><code>p4d.24xlarge</code><span> from Amazon — without even accounting for the technical expertise required to deploy and run the jobs.</span></p><p><span>AWS is obviously charging a markup on its EC2 instances, but OpenAI’s costs include training and storing the model weights (likely reasonably cheap </span><a href="https://generatingconversation.substack.com/p/lora-explained" rel="">with LoRA</a><span>), building &amp; maintaining the fine-tuning infrastructure, and the expertise needed to rack &amp; stack thousands of GPUs internally</span></p><p><span>.</span></p><p><span>If we had a dense enough workload, perhaps we could justify renting a </span><code>p4d.24xlarge</code><span> at the yearly reserved cost. At $19.22 per-hour, we’ll be paying about $166K per-year.</span></p><p>Let’s assume again we’re using LoRA to fine-tune a model on 8 A100s, perhaps at 2 hours per run. We can do 12 fine-tuning runs per-day. on these GPUs, or 4,380 fine-tuning runs per year. We’ll allocate one engineer to deploy, check, and validate fine-tuning runs full-time (we don’t envy them!), which will cost us perhaps $200K per-year. (Let’s also assume that we have plenty of data readily available to us to keep fine-tuning jobs going constantly.)</p><p>At $366K ($166K AWS + $200K talent), we’re paying around $80 per-fine-tuning run, about 8-20x higher than what we’re paying OpenAI!</p><p>This just to fine-tune a model. While per-token inference costs for fine-tuned GPT-3.5 is 10x more expensive than GPT-3.5 it is still 10x cheaper than GPT-4! Serving a model on your own hardware is significantly more expensive unless you can reach a large enough scale to fully utilize serving hardware or elastically scale (impossible when GPU availability is limited).</p><p>We’ll give the back of the envelope math a rest, but it proves a critical point: The major LLM providers’ advantage doesn’t just lie in the quality of the model but in their ability to serve models at extreme economies of scale. It simply doesn’t make sense for most organizations to run after their own open-source LLM deployments. They’ll be sinking needless time, talent, and money into an unsolvable optimization problem, while competitors will move faster and likely achieve better quality by layering on top of OpenAI.</p><p><span>Of course, that doesn’t mean that open-source models have no future. We </span><a href="https://generatingconversation.substack.com/p/open-source-llms-shouldnt-try-to" rel="">touched on this last week</a><span>, and our friend Nathan Lambert at Interconnects </span><a href="https://www.interconnects.ai/p/are-open-llms-viable" rel="">recently wrote about the future of open-source models as well</a><span>. Open-source models must get smaller over time to reduce the cost, complexity, and time required to customize and run them.</span></p><p>For everything else, the major LLM providers will dominate.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>T-Mobile is moving people to newer, more expensive plans starting with the November bill cycle unless customers call the company to opt out, according to multiple reports.</p>
<p>The forced migration <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/174s0rx/forced_plan_migrations_coming_soon/">surfaced on Reddit</a> two days ago and was <a href="https://tmo.report/2023/10/breaking-t-mobile-will-force-customers-onto-newer-plans-unless-you-opt-out/">confirmed by The Mobile Report</a>, which published portions of leaked documents indicating how the plan changes will be implemented. T-Mobile also confirmed the change to CNET, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/t-mobile-is-forcibly-moving-those-on-older-plans-to-some-of-its-newer-ones-in-november/">telling the news site</a> that "there will be an increase of approximately $10 per line with the migration."</p>
<p>"We're always looking for ways to give our customers more from our services so we're moving a small number who were on older rate plans to newer plans that will deliver them enhanced features," T-Mobile told CNET.</p>
<p>The Mobile Report article said that users "can contact support upon notification of the pending changes and, after listening to a pitch on why they should migrate anyway, be allowed to opt out of the migration." Consumers will be moved to plans such as Go5G or Essentials, depending on what they have now.</p>
<p>Users who want to keep their current plan should call T-Mobile after receiving the notification that will be sent starting on Tuesday next week.</p>
<h2>T-Mobile: It’s not a price hike, just “a different cost”</h2>
<p>The leaked documents show what customer service reps are being trained to tell users. Instead of saying the price is going up, reps will say, "We are not raising the price of any of our plans; we are moving you to a newer plan with more benefits at a different cost." That's the talking point customer service reps are supposed to use if a customer mentions that they saw commercials "about how T-Mobile won't raise the price of my plan."</p>
<p>Customers will be switched to a newer plan if they're on any of the following packages offered in previous years: Simple Choice/Select Choice, Magenta, Magenta 55, ONE Plan, and Simple Choice Business.</p>
<p>Something a bit strange is going on with the Magenta plan. A T-Mobile document shown in The Mobile Report's article says that Magenta customers will be migrated to Go5G. But it also says that some Simple Choice and Select Choice customers will be migrated to Magenta. T-Mobile's list of <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans">current plans</a> includes Magenta, so it isn't clear why anyone with that plan would be automatically migrated.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In 2015, then-CEO John Legere <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/18/8249169/t-mobile-uncontract-announced">unveiled the "Un-Contract"</a> in which Simple Choice customers could keep their plans at the same price "for as long as you're a customer." T-Mobile currently has a "<a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/support/account/price-lock">price lock</a>" but only for customers on certain plans who activated their accounts after April 28, 2022.</p>
<p>Customers who activated accounts before April 28, 2022, had the Un-Contract guarantee, which no longer guarantees that rates won't be raised. T-Mobile's price lock page says, "we have committed to pay your final month's recurring service charge if we were to raise prices and you choose to leave. Just let us know within 60 days."</p>
<p>T-Mobile's <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans">current plans</a> range from $60 to $100 a month for a single line or $5 more if you don't enroll in the AutoPay discount. T-Mobile recently started <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/support/account/autopay">requiring</a> a debit card or linked bank account to get the AutoPay discount, which may be concerning to users because of the company's history of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/t-mobile-screwup-caused-customers-to-see-other-users-billing-information/">data breaches and leaks</a>.</p>
<h2>$5 or $10 per-line increases</h2>
<p>One of the leaked documents says that customers will see $5 or $10 per-line monthly increases depending on which plan they have now. The document says the increase can be offset with the $5 AutoPay discount, but that discount has been available for years.</p>
<p>Customers whose plans are set to change should receive notifications via email and SMS starting October 17, though a document said that "timing will vary depending on the customer's bill cycle." The notifications will "include a link to a landing page with plan details and an option to call Care to opt out of this plan migration," the document said.</p>
<p>It will be possible to move back to an old plan for at least a little while, even if customers don't opt out in time. A document that describes a few customer service scenarios tells reps how to respond if a user says, "I just got my new bill, and you changed my plan without telling me."</p>
<p>Reps are supposed to tell customers, "We recently notified you of a change to your plan," and that if the plan "doesn't suit your needs, I can help you with the opt out request to keep your current plan."</p>
<p>We contacted T-Mobile today and will update this article if we get more details.</p>
<p>T-Mobile was once a smaller wireless company fighting behemoths AT&amp;T and Verizon but is now one of three major national carriers after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/04/t-mobile-sprint-took-a-risk-by-finishing-merger-without-calif-approval/">acquiring Sprint</a> in 2020. Critics of the merger <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/t-mobilesprint-merger-will-bring-higher-prices-small-carriers-tell-fcc/">predicted</a> it would result in higher prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/174uelk/megathread_forced_plan_migration_for_older_plans/">On Reddit</a>, T-Mobile users called the change a "shady" and "money-grubbing" move. "We are slowly turning into the Canada wireless industry with high prices everywhere," one person wrote. Another wrote, "How long until they just force you off without a choice? 1 year? 2? Pulling a VZW/ATT seems inevitable at this point."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>A hundred years ago, if you were a pedestrian, crossing the street was simple: You walked across it.</p>
<p>Today, if there's traffic in the area and you want to follow the law, you need to find a crosswalk. And if there's a traffic light, you need to wait for it to change to green.</p>

<p>Fail to do so, and you're committing a crime: jaywalking. In some cities — Los Angeles, for instance — police ticket tens of thousands of pedestrians annually for jaywalking, with&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://la.curbed.com/archives/2013/12/the_lapds_250_jaywalking_tickets_are_total_bullshit.php">fines of up to $250</a>.</p>
<p>To most people, this seems part of the basic nature of roads. But it's actually the result of an aggressive, forgotten 1920s campaign led by auto groups and manufacturers that redefined who owned the city streets.</p>
<p>"In the early days of the automobile, it was drivers' job to avoid you, not your job to avoid them," says <a href="http://www.cts.virginia.edu/peter-norton/">Peter Norton</a>, a historian at the University of Virginia and author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fighting-Traffic-American-Inside-Technology/dp/0262516128" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Fighting-Traffic-American-Inside-Technology/dp/0262516128?ascsubtag=___vx__p_7315914__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___vx__p_7315914__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><i>Fighting Traffic: The Dawn of the Motor Age in the American City</i></a>. "But under the new model, streets became a place for cars — and as a pedestrian, it's your fault if you get hit."</p>
<p>One of the keys to this shift was the creation of the crime of jaywalking. Here's a history of how that happened.</p>
<h3>When city streets were a public space</h3>

<p>Manhattan's Hester Street, on the Lower East Side, in 1914. (Maurice Branger/Roger Viollet/Getty Images)</p>
<p>It's strange to imagine now, but prior to the 1920s, city streets looked dramatically different than they do today. They were considered to be a public space: a place for pedestrians, pushcart vendors, horse-drawn vehicles, streetcars, and children at play.</p>
<p>"Pedestrians were walking in the streets anywhere they wanted, whenever they wanted, usually without looking," Norton says. During the 1910s there were few crosswalks painted on the street, and they were generally ignored by pedestrians.</p>
<p><span>As cars began to spread widely during the 1920s, the</span> consequence of this was predictable: death. Over the first few decades of the century, the number of people killed by cars skyrocketed.</p>

<p>Those killed were mostly pedestrians, not drivers, and they <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_-3NAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CWhat+Shall+Be+the+Cure+for+Automobile+Speed+Mania?%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rri4b633M3&amp;sig=-Bp6tXcM-ysIRDOFLuB8khgbEz8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3OS2VO-hKIG9ggS-6oOgDA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CWhat%20Shall%20Be%20the%20Cure%20for%20Automobile%20Speed%20Mania%3F%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false">were disproportionately the elderly and  children</a>, who had previously had free rein to play in the streets.</p>
<p>The public response to these deaths, by and large, was outrage. Automobiles were often seen as frivolous playthings, akin to the way we think of yachts today (they were often called <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/which-pleasure-car-fits-the-buyers/">"pleasure cars"</a>). And on the streets, they were considered violent intruders.</p>
<p>Cities erected prominent memorials for children killed in traffic accidents, and newspapers covered traffic deaths in detail, usually blaming drivers. They also published cartoons demonizing cars, often associating them with the Grim Reaper.</p>

<p>The November 23, 1924, cover of the New York Times shows a common representation of cars during the era — as killing machines. (New York Times)</p>
<p>Before formal traffic laws were put in place, judges typically ruled that in any collision, the larger vehicle — that is, the car — was to blame. In most pedestrian deaths, drivers were charged with manslaughter regardless of the circumstances of the accident.</p>
<h3>How cars took over the roads</h3>

<p>In 1925 Midtown Manhattan, pedestrians compete for space with increasing automobile traffic. (Edwin Levick/Getty Images)</p>
<p>As deaths mounted, anti-car activists sought to slow them down. In 1920, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_-3NAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CWhat+Shall+Be+the+Cure+for+Automobile+Speed+Mania?%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rri4b633M3&amp;sig=-Bp6tXcM-ysIRDOFLuB8khgbEz8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3OS2VO-hKIG9ggS-6oOgDA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CWhat%20Shall%20Be%20the%20Cure%20for%20Automobile%20Speed%20Mania%3F%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false">Illustrated World wrote</a>, "Every car should be equipped with a device that would hold the speed down to whatever number of miles stipulated for the city in which its owner lived."</p>
<p>The turning point came in 1923, says Norton, when 42,000 Cincinnati residents signed a petition for a ballot initiative that would require all cars to have a governor limiting them to 25 miles per hour. Local auto dealers were terrified, and sprang into action, sending letters to every car owner in the city and taking out advertisements against the measure.</p>

<p>A 1923 ad in the Cincinnati Post, taken out by a coalition of auto dealers. (Cincinnati Post)</p>
<p>The measure failed. It also galvanized auto groups nationwide, showing them that if they weren't proactive, the potential for automobile sales could be minimized.</p>
<p>In response, automakers, dealers, and enthusiast groups worked to legally redefine the street — so that pedestrians, rather than cars, would be restricted.</p>

<p>The idea that pedestrians shouldn't be permitted to walk wherever they liked had been present as far back as 1912, when <a href="http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2014/11/jaywalkers-and-jayhawkers-pedestrian.html">Kansas City passed the first ordinance</a> requiring them to cross streets at crosswalks. But in the mid-20s, auto groups took up the campaign with vigor, passing laws all over the country.</p>
<p>Most notably, auto industry groups took control of a series of meetings convened by Herbert Hoover (then secretary of commerce) to create a model traffic law that could be used by cities across the country. Due to their influence, the product of those meetings — the 1928 <a href="http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000968627">Model Municipal Traffic Ordinance</a> — was largely based off traffic law in Los Angeles, which had enacted strict pedestrian controls in 1925.</p>
<p>"The crucial thing it said was that pedestrians would cross only at crosswalks, and only at right angles," Norton says. "Essentially, this is the traffic law that we're still living with today."</p>

<p>Government safety posters ridicule jaywalking in the 1920s and '30s. (National Safety Council/Library of Congress)</p>
<p>Even while passing these laws, however, auto industry groups faced a problem: In Kansas City and elsewhere, no one had followed the rules, and they were rarely enforced by police or judges. To solve it, the industry took up several strategies.</p>
<p>One was an attempt to shape news coverage of car accidents. The National Automobile Chamber of Commerce, an industry group, established a free wire service for newspapers: Reporters could send in the basic details of a traffic accident and would get in return a complete article to print the next day. These articles, printed widely, shifted the blame for accidents to pedestrians — signaling that following these new laws was important.</p>
<p>Similarly, AAA began sponsoring school safety campaigns and poster contests, crafted around the importance of staying out of the street. Some of the campaigns also ridiculed kids who didn't follow the rules — in 1925, for instance, hundreds of Detroit school children watched the "trial" of a 12-year-old who'd crossed a street unsafely, and, as <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/technology_and_culture/v048/48.2norton.html">Norton writes</a>, a jury of his peers sentenced him to clean chalkboards for a week.</p>
<p>This was also part of the final strategy: shame. In getting pedestrians to follow traffic laws, "the ridicule of their fellow citizens is far more effective than any other means which might be adopted," said E.B. Lefferts, the head of the Automobile Club of Southern California in the 1920s. Norton likens the resulting campaign to the <a href="http://articles.drugabuse.net/drug_ads/">anti-drug messaging of the '80s and '90s</a>, in which drug use was portrayed as not only dangerous but stupid.</p>

<p>At a 1924 New York safety parade, a jaywalking clown is repeatedly rammed by a slow-moving Model T. (Courtesy of the Barron Collier Company, via Peter Norton)</p>
<p>Auto campaigners lobbied police to publicly shame transgressors by whistling or shouting at them — and even carrying women back to the sidewalk — instead of quietly reprimanding or fining them. They staged safety campaigns in which actors dressed in 19th-century garb, or as clowns, were hired to cross the street illegally, signifying that the practice was outdated and foolish. In a 1924 New York safety campaign, a clown was marched in front of a slow-moving Model T and rammed repeatedly.</p>
<p>This strategy also explains the name that was given to crossing illegally on foot: jaywalking. During this era, <a href="http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2014/11/jaywalkers-and-jayhawkers-pedestrian.html">the word "jay" meant</a> something like "rube" or "hick" — a person from the sticks, who didn't know how to behave in a city. So pro-auto groups promoted use of the word "jay walker" as  someone who didn't know how to walk in a city, threatening public safety.</p>
<p>At first, the term was seen as offensive, even shocking. Pedestrians fired back, calling dangerous driving "jay driving."</p>
<p>But jaywalking caught on (and eventually became one word). Safety organizations and police began using it formally, in safety announcements.</p>

<p>Use of the word "jaywalking" increases steeply starting in the 1920s. (Google Ngram Viewer)</p>
<p>Ultimately, both the word jaywalking and the concept that pedestrians shouldn't walk freely on streets became so deeply entrenched that few people know this history. "The campaign was extremely successful," Norton says. "It totally changed the message about what streets are for."</p>

<p>Google has agreed to stop advertising YouTube TV as "$600 less than cable" after losing an appeal of a previous ruling that went against the company. Google said it will "modify or cease the disputed advertising claim."</p>
<p>The case was handled in the advertising industry's self-regulatory system, not in a court of law. The National Advertising Review Board (NARB) <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/dd/narb-google-youtube-tv">announced today</a> that it rejected Google's appeal and recommended that the company discontinue the YouTube TV claim.</p>
<p>YouTube TV launched in 2017 for $35 a month, but the base package is $72.99 after the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/youtube-tv-jumps-in-price-again-its-now-72-99-per-month/">latest price hike</a> in March 2023. Google's "$600 less than cable" claim was challenged by Charter, which uses the brand name Spectrum and is the second-biggest cable company after Comcast. The National Advertising Division (NAD) previously ruled in Charter's favor but Google <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/dd/google-youtube-tv">appealed the decision</a> to the NARB in August.</p>
<p>"Charter contended the $600 figure was inaccurate, arguing that its Spectrum TV Select service in Los Angeles only cost around $219 a year more than Google's YouTube TV service," according to a <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/388447/youtube-tv-told-to-stop-boasting-it-costs-600-les.html">MediaPost article</a> in August.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g3WtdwtIok&amp;t">Google ad</a> claimed that YouTube TV provided $600 in "annual average savings" compared to cable as of January 2023. A disclosure on the ad said the price was for "new users only" and that the $600 annual savings was "based on a study by SmithGeiger of the published cost of comparable standalone cable in the top 50 Nielsen DMAs, including all fees, taxes, promotion pricing, DVR box rental and service fees, and a 2nd cable box."</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Disclosures “not clear and conspicuous”</h2>
<p>Agreeing with the NAD decision, an NARB panel found that the price comparison provided by Google did not justify the "$600 less" claim. The panel "determined that the commercial disclosures were not clear and conspicuous" and "concluded that at least one reasonable interpretation of the challenged claim is that YouTube TV is $600 less than any comparable service available from companies traditionally associated with cable services."</p>
<p>The NARB also said that Google's "comparison does not align with the challenged claim" for the following reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Many households can subscribe to basic Spectrum service without renting cable boxes, therefore Google failed to justify the cost of two set-top boxes in its price comparison, and</li>
<li>In certain markets, cable providers offer regional sports networks (RSNs) but YouTube does not, therefore Google did not have a valid reason for adding the cost of Spectrum's Sports View option to the price comparison.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The NARB announcement quotes Google's response in which it agreed to stop making the advertising claim. Google said it "disagrees with NARB's determination that people watching the challenged commercials will somehow understand 'cable' to mean something other than traditional cable television," but "intends to modify or cease the disputed advertising claim." Google also said that at a later date, it "may reconsider the claim based on updated information."</p>
<p>When contacted by Ars today, Google said it had no further comment.</p>

Plug stuff into the cubes, plug the cubes into the wall, and use the remote to control which cubes are active. The buttons work </span><em>instantly</em><span>, with a range of 30 m (100 ft) even through walls. There is no app or WiFi. One button can control multiple plugs and the same plug can be paired to multiple remotes. (Cost: Around $25 for five plugs and two remotes.)</span></p><p>The obvious use for these is lights. When your roommate complains about you strobing them (it’s irresistible) remind them that LED bulbs’ lifespans are not shortened by on/off cycles. They’re also great for fans, air purifiers, and humidifiers.</p><p>Or, you can use this as a remote for a dumb window-unit air conditioner. (Make sure to check the rated current.)</p><p><span>Or, you can use this as a </span><em>signal</em><span>—put a light in the basement for grandma to activate if she needs you. Or put lights in rooms around the house all paired to one button, and strobe them when you want everyone to gather for dinner.</span></p><p>Or, you can use this for tea. My usual process for making tea is to walk to the kitchen and start the kettle. Then, because it takes an eternity for water to boil, I go back to my desk to wait. Then I forget about the tea. With this remote you can leave the kettle in a “ready” state: filled with water, kettle on, outlet off. Activate the remote a few minutes ahead of time and make tea in a single trip with no waiting.</p><p>Or, my printer is cursed. After being on for a few days it refuses to print anything longer than two pages. I know this shouldn’t be possible, but I’ve exhausted every avenue for fixing it. I could get a new printer, but maybe it’s a network issue or something?</p><p>Restarting the printer fixes it. But the printer has one of those infuriating power buttons where you hold it for ten seconds and then it ignores you. So for a year, I’d walk to the room with the printer and reach deep inside the cabinet to physically unplug and re-plug it. Now I use one of these cubes and remotely power cycle it when necessary. Utterly graceless, but effective.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg" width="276" height="272.32" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:740,&quot;width&quot;:750,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:276,&quot;bytes&quot;:53687,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Remote-controlled light sockets</strong><span>.

Even better, it reduces how often you need to refill the tank.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg" width="172" height="293.088" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:852,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:172,&quot;bytes&quot;:89725,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Digital outlet timers</strong><span>: A good alternative if you need more precise timing or find mechanical timers too beautiful and intuitive and bulletproof.

The one true home decoration strategy is: plants. If you don’t have any plants, forget home intelligence levels and get some plants. Now, to keep them alive, you put one of these stakes in the soil and the end of the cable in a container of water. The soil then stays damp through voodoo magic. (It’s not a siphon because the water can be below the plant.) Purely physical, no electronics.

But did you know how much better they’ve gotten in recent years? I bring this up because where possible I advise avoiding things with built-in batteries. Partly that’s so the lifespan isn’t limited by the battery. But it’s also more convenient: To recharge, you swap the batteries with the ones on the charger and you’re done. This is much easier than going through a remove / find charger / charge / wait / replace cycle.</span></p><p><span>One lesson is that </span><strong>lights do well</strong><span>. Half of smart homes seem to be about lights. By combining remotes, motion sensors, timers, and maybe Clappers, you can go quite far with lights just using midwit solutions.</span></p><p><span>A second is that </span><strong>power is the interface</strong><span>. All of the above items are either single devices, or devices that “communicate” with each other by the brute force method of turning power on or off for each other. It’s interesting how far that takes you.</span></p><p><span>Finally, </span><strong>dumber devices are often more interoperable</strong><span>. Physical on/off switches are good. If a device has one, then you can set it to “on” and then control it through an external remote or whatever. But increasingly many things have clever touch sensor power buttons. These can’t be activated without pressing the button, so none of this works.</span></p><p><span>(BTW, manufacturers, if you want to use touch sensors and you don’t want to lose the </span><em>massive</em><span> midwit market, make things that automatically turn on when first connected to power, without waiting for a touch.)</span></p><p><span>There are many things that would make midwit life better, and it seems like </span><em>could</em><span> be made, but aren’t.</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>Remote controlled dimmers.</strong><span> Modern dimmers work by truncating the lower-amplitude parts of the alternating current—basically switching the lights on and off very quickly. There should be light-bulb sockets with a remote to control the dimming level.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Whistle controlled power switches.</strong><span> Clapping is (mildly) annoying. Couldn’t we use other sounds?</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>PM</span><sub>2.5</sub><span> controlled outlets.</span></strong><span> The biggest advantage of commercial air purifiers over building DIY versions is that some integrate air quality sensors and turn on automatically when needed. I want a device that samples the air and activate and outlet if PM</span><sub>2.5</sub><span> is above a threshold.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Remote-controlled wall-switch pressers.</strong><span> This is rather cursed, but I’d like a device to physically flip my existing wall switches when activated by a remote, so my lights can be be dumb </span><em>and</em><span> midwit. (There are “smart” variants now, but seemingly no midwit versions.)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Power-controlled remote pressers.</strong><span> This is </span><em>utterly</em><span> cursed, but hear me out: I want a gadget that I physically attach to a remote. When the gadget gets power, it presses the “on” button on the remote. When it loses power, it presses the “off” button.</span><br></p><p><span>Why? Because then you could automate anything with a remote! If I have remote-controlled motorized blinds, I’d like to put the remote into this gadget, and then plug the gadget into an an outlet timer for a daily schedule. Or use a Clapper or motion sensor or whatever.</span><br></p><p>Like I said, cursed. Maybe it could just memorize and repeat the signal from remote instead of physically pressing buttons?</p></li><li><p><strong>Remote-controlled light sockets that respond to power cycles.</strong><span> The annoying thing about remote-controlled light sockets is they render your existing switches useless. There is no need! I want a variant that works like this: If the power is quickly turned off and on again, the outlet switches from powered to unpowered (or vice-versa). Then you could use remotes </span><em>and</em><span> existing switches, with the only downside that you need to remember to “double flip” all your lights.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Gates.</strong><span> Say you have Clapper-activated lights in your bedroom, but you do a lot of sleep-clapping. Well, you can plug the lights into a Clapper, and the Clapper into an outlet timer. That’s basically an AND gate.</span><br></p><p><span>But what about OR gates? What if you want to turn on an air conditioner when there is motion </span><em>or</em><span> if the temperature goes above X degrees? I think an OR gate would just amount to a “splitter”, except with multiple inputs and one output. But this doesn’t seem to be something you can buy, perhaps because if the inputs came from different circuits that would cause explosions?</span><br></p><p><span>Or how about NOT gates? Maybe you have an air purifier that’s really loud, so you only want it to run when you’re not in the room. There should be a gadget that reverses the power signal provided by a motion sensor.</span><br></p><p><span>But then, how would a NOT gate work? The gadget would need to plug into the wall to provide power when the signal is off. Which means that </span><em>really</em><span> it would be a (NOT SIGNAL) AND (MAINS) gate. Or maybe could be an XOR gate instead?</span><br></p><p>Or can we hand NAND gates? Or NOR gates? There’s no obvious need, true. But I’d rest easier knowing my janky kettle control system was built out of functionally complete base units.</p></li></ol></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>On the 11th of October, Dutch parliament organized a hearing on the <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/chat-control/">EU “Chatcontrol” proposal</a>, with a focus on client side scanning. Dutch parliament had earlier passed two motions calling on the Dutch government not to support this proposal, but our government has declared it will ignore those motions. This hearing was timely because next week, or even this Friday, EU member states vote on how to proceed with this terrible proposal.</p>

</center>
<p>I’ve translated my introduction in the Dutch parliamentary hearing because I think it might add a little bit to the debate, and also because it sheds a light on the poor state of Dutch democracy, and some sunlight might help.</p>
<p>More context on this proposed EU law can be found, in Dutch, <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/client-side-scanning/">in a post I wrote earlier</a>. Automated translation will likely do a decent job on this. Or follow Patrick Breyer’s explanation <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/chat-control/">here</a>. He’s been on the case for years now.</p>
<p>Transcript (machine transcribed, machine translated, lightly edited, a few sentences added for international context):</p>
<p>I have been involved in this subject for about fifteen years now. I once supplied software to the Dutch police for investigations into CSAM. I was also a regulator of the Dutch intelligence and security agencies, so I know a bit about proportionality and subsidiarity and law.</p>
<p>For a long time I’ve also been on occasional talks between industry and government about how child pornography can be combated or made more difficult. So the subject is very familiar to me. It’s also about AI, because the AI will have to scan our communications. I have also written a small book about AI and a training course. So I hope I know a little bit about it.</p>
<p>And in contrast to my esteemed, highly educated predecessors, I will perhaps talk about the subject in very plain language.</p>
<p>[Holds up QR code] I want to show this to the viewers at home for a moment. You can find my position paper here. This worked very well last time I presented here.</p>
<p>And the QR code is perhaps good to keep in mind how many feelings this aroused among people around the corona crisis. What we are talking about now is that in all our WhatsApp groups, our Signal groups, our Telegram groups, a new participant will join the conversation, namely an EU logo.</p>
<p>And all the photos we put there, all the videos we put there, are scanned by a computer. And that computer first has a list of known bad material. But the EU proposal also says that we should also have AI and it should say, “Oops, that child photo is the wrong kind of child photo.”</p>
<p>In addition, the law is quite general about it, says the AI should detect the “approaching of children”. Well, that’s a very broad term, but they mean grooming. And if the system sees one of those things, then there will be a report to an EU official.</p>
<p>And this person gets reports all day long, “Is this CSAM or not?”. And only if the material is evidently incorrect, no action will be taken. So if the photo is of a toaster, and not a child, that is the end of it. But in almost all other cases, the process continues. Then the material goes to two places. It goes to a local authority that will do research there. And the law actually doesn’t say much about what happens then. And that is crucial. Because we often say “Think about the children.” Let’s do that too.</p>
<p>But there is a fantastic stream of reports from this system. Because it is still very difficult to determine the nature of a photo. For example, the Dutch Forensic Institute has said, “We are not going to look at a photo and say whether this is a minor or not.” The NFI has said, “We can’t do that. It doesn’t work. We need X-rays. We just can’t.”</p>
<p>But the European Union has said, “Our computer can do that.” This leads to a a fantastic stream of “Maybe it’s wrong, maybe it’s not wrong” material. And it is then passed on to a local police station or an authority that will look at it. They might start an investigation.</p>
<p>And the first thing a citizen notices is that they receive a letter from the police. At such and such time, the EU has found that you have shared a photo that we unfortunately cannot include here. Because it is possibly CSAM,  so we cannot show you. But at 5.34 p.m. we have found a photo that was not good and we started an investigation.</p>
<p>I just said, “Think of the children.” And we really have to do that. And we want to make their lives better. But their lives will not get any better if this system starts a huge stream of unjust investigations.</p>
<p>“When we found five justifiable investigations, how many unjust investigations have we launched. Did we make it worse?” Because an unjust investigation into someone can end up terribly bad. Especially if the person under investigation is not perfect.</p>
<p>And many people think, “It’s not that bad to be investigated, because then I go to the police station and I just explain it, I explain that my own child was in the bath and so on.” You can really forget that illusion.</p>
<p>At the moment the investigation starts, you have nothing more you can “just explain”. But you are in all kinds of databases. And I want to come back to that. The people at Europol have already said, “We are going to keep that database.” Including all the things that turned out to be unjust.</p>
<p>Because they said, “Who knows? Maybe we can do something with it.” And that brings me to my second topic here. This is not a law that needs to be tuned a little bit and then it is good. This has never happened before. In my old work, when I had to regulate the AIVD and the MIVD [Dutch Intelligence, Security and SIGINT agencies], we were asked individually whether we could listen to these ten people or not.</p>
<p>And then we held a meeting about it with two wise people and me. And now we are talking about 500 million Europeans, and saying, “Let’s just apply those scanners!” That is incredible. This is not something… If we approve this as a country, if we as the Netherlands vote in favour of this in Europe and say, “Do it,” we will cross a threshold that we have never crossed before.</p>
<p>Namely, every European must be monitored with a computer program, with a technology…</p>
<p>With a technology of which the vast, overwhelming majority of scientists have said, “It is not finished.” I mentioned earlier the example that the Dutch National Forensic Institute says, “We cannot do this by hand.” The EU has now said, “Our computer can do that.”</p>
<p>420 scientists have signed a petition saying, “We know this technology, some of us invented it, we just can’t do it.” We can’t even make a reliable spam filter. Making a spam filter is exactly the same technology, by the way, but then much easier. It just doesn’t work that well, but the consequences aren’t that scary for a spam filter.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are now MPs who say, “Well, I feel this is going to work. I have confidence in this.” While the scientists, including the real scientists who came here tonight, say, “Well, we don’t see how this could work well enough”.</p>
<p>And then government then says, “Let’s start this experiment with those 500 million Europeans.”</p>
<p>WhatsApp and Telegram - well, Telegram is not going to implement this law, but WhatsApp will. They will not hesitate to announce this to all their users with a large EU logo. “Pay attention, the EU is watching you. We have installed software on your phone, on behalf of the government that will keep an eye on you.”</p>
<p>And I don’t think that is going to go down very well.</p>
<p>Also, if we want to learn how to implement such scanning technology, if we want to learn internationally how to do this, there is only one country in the world that can help us.</p>
<p>And that is China. And I don’t know if that’s such a good prospect.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <blockquote>
  <p><em>Can’t Be Fucked</em></p>

  <p>Aussie slang for not wanting to, or not having the energy and motivation to do something.</p>

  <p>“Man, i really can’t be fucked changing the channel, let’s just watch Springer.”</p>

  <p><em>- Urban Dictionary</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used to think that if I could just learn a bunch of things about programming, that would make me a better programmer. Sure, the learning I’ve done so far <em>has</em> made me a better programmer, but the person I was striving to become was a little more… admirable.</p>

<p>Whether it’s at work or in my open source travels, I routinely come across developers who are the real deal: they’re conscientious and judicious in an unwavering way. They set a standard for themselves and do not compromise on it. Whether that’s a deliberate thing or whether they’re just built that way, it’s humbling to witness. If there’s a flaky test, they investigate it and fix it. If there’s a bug they spot in the wild, they make a ticket, and maybe even fix it then-and-there. If a new feature doesn’t gel well with the existing code, they refactor the code first rather than hacking the feature in. They’ll dive as far down the stack as necessary to get to the bottom of something. None of these things are necessary but great developers know that if they don’t address a problem early, and properly, it will only cost them more time in the long run.</p>

<p>‘But,’, you say, ‘premature optimisation is the root of all evil! Duplication is better than the wrong abstraction! Don’t be an architecture astronaut!’</p>

<p>The developers I’m thinking about already know of all those takes and have internalised them long ago. They know that sometimes ‘good enough’ <em>is</em> the right choice given the constraints of a project. They know that sometimes you need to cut scope to stay on-track. They know that sometimes it’s better to wait to learn more about a domain before rearchitecting a system. And yet in spite of those constraints their output remains golden. These are hard working motherf*ckers whose diligence and perseverance put other devs to shame.</p>

<p>Other devs… like me.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I just CBF. I spent months (part time, of course) building out an end-to-end test system for my open source project Lazygit, and every day I think of all the regressions that system has prevented and how much harder it would be to add that system now given how many tests have been written since. I know for a fact it was worth the effort. So why haven’t I added end-to-end tests to my other project, Lazydocker? Because I CBF.</p>

<p>I raised an issue in somebody else’s open source repo and they asked me to present them with a minimal repro git repo. Why haven’t I done that yet? Because I CBF.</p>

<p>Why do I still have so much of my code living in a God Struct? If I could just finish that big refactor I started over a year ago, my codebase would be far easier to navigate and contribute to. The answer, dear reader, is that I CBF.</p>

<p>Is it burnout? Maybe. Is it a lack of Growth Mindset? Hard to say. Is it just the reality of my personality? Who knows.</p>

<p>As I continue my journey as a developer I learn more about myself, and one of the things I’ve learnt is that my motivation ebbs and flows. I’ll have a good run, inhabiting the persona of the developers I look up to, however imperfectly, until I once again find myself with the constraint that trumps all the extrinsic constraints of the project at hand: a deficiency of motivation.</p>

<p>I’ve also learnt that knowledge only gets you so far. I’m still just scratching the surface of all the developer-y things there are to be learnt, but even for the topics I consider myself knowledgeable, knowing what’s right and doing what’s right are two very different things. Knowing the long-term pain of tech debt is certainly a motivator for avoiding it, but it’s no guarantee.</p>

<p>And sometimes knowledge can be wielded impiously: ‘I’d add more tests but too many tests creates a maintenance burden’. ‘I <em>could</em> refactor this but I want to wait a little to see how other features affect things’. ‘Keep It Simple, Stupid’. ‘Premature optimisation’, ‘Cut scope aggressively’, etc. These maxims can be deployed for evil just as well as good. Have you ever hid behind one of these lines to hide the fact that in reality you just CBF?</p>

<p>Maybe you don’t have the energy to write perfect code, but honesty requires less creativity than lying. It’s a breath of fresh air when a contributor admits some element of their pull request is lacking because they’re lazy. At least then you have the opportunity to judge for yourself whether their laziness exceeds your own standards or whether their time is indeed better spent working on the next thing. That’s a much easier game to play than bandying software engineering maxims.</p>

<p>So, if you find that you CBF, don’t be dismayed; it happens to everyone (except those very special people we all aspire to). If in the moment you don’t have the strength to overcome it, at least be honest. And if you’ve been going 100% for too long, maybe it’s time to take that holiday.</p>

<p>I’d like to end this post with an exploration about how laziness evolved for a reason and that despite us all wishing we had more motivation, there are benefits to being selective with our energy, but… I CBF ;)</p>

Every week, I come across new tools and techniques related to LLMs on my Twitter feed. It can be difficult to keep up with ways in which the LLM ecosystem is evolving. And if you’re just starting to use LLMs, the stream may seem to be moving too quickly to jump in!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The good news is that we've now reached a point where there are reliable and easy-to-use tools to work with LLMs. While more advanced tools will likely appear in the future, the current choices for fine-tuning models or making predictions are pretty impressive. They empower you to create some truly powerful applications.</p><p>In this post, I dive into the core principles of LLMs and the tools and techniques you’ll need to get started with LLMs.</p><h2><strong>What are LLMs?</strong></h2><p>A Large Language Model, as the name implies, refers to a model trained on large datasets to comprehend and generate content. Essentially, it's a transformer model on a large scale. The transformer model itself is a neural network designed to grasp context and meaning through the analysis of relationships within sequential data.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7acad02c40d777c57e_vhiySUD-e-bRSZISk2VyN92nxWrMQGP9AqqiDPVsTm2_sWaccjGWkxihFg4DKiL2lfhbg3xonfvMRpzDnvwuvIuiJhto8cPiltZgjhY4Y6vL6-yzH-f4-eqNApwrO8z6lqmy9iRyzNMuqHq6gkAeYX4.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The architecture of transformer model (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Transformers are great for LLMs because they have two important features: positional encodings and self-attention.</p><p>Positional encodings help the model understand the order of words in a sequence and include this information in the word <a href="https://vickiboykis.com/what_are_embeddings/">embeddings</a>. Here's a bit more about it from Brandon Rohrer’s article "<a href="https://e2eml.school/transformers.html">Transformers from Scratch</a>":</p><p>“There are several ways that position information could be introduced into our embedded representation of words, but the way it was done in the original transformer was to add a circular wiggle.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526df6b5c3a19649d0943e5_circular-wiggle.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>“The position of the word in the embedding space acts as the center of a circle. A perturbation is added to it, depending on where it falls in the order of the sequence of words. For each position, the word is moved the same distance but at a different angle, resulting in a circular pattern as you move through the sequence. Words that are close to each other in the sequence have similar perturbations, but words that are far apart are perturbed in different directions.”</p><p>Self-attention allows the words in a sequence to interact with each other and find out who they should pay more attention to. To help you understand this concept better, I’ve borrowed an example from Jay Alammar’s “<a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/">The Illustrated Transformer</a>” article:</p><p>“Say the following sentence is an input sentence we want to translate:”</p><p>‘The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired’</p><p>“What does ‘it’ in this sentence refer to? Is it referring to the street or to the animal? It’s a simple question to a human, but not as simple to an algorithm.”</p><p>“When the model is processing the word ‘it,’ self-attention allows it to associate ‘it’ with ‘animal.’”</p><p>Transformers utilize a powerful attention mechanism known as multi-head attention. Think of it as combining several self-attentions. This way, we can capture various aspects of language and better understand how different entities relate to each other in a sequence.</p><p>If you're interested in a visual guide to understand LLMs and transformers, <a href="https://ig.ft.com/generative-ai/">this resource</a> is worth exploring.</p><h2><strong>What can LLMs do?</strong></h2><p>With LLMs, the possibilities are vast — from creating AI assistants and chatbots to engaging in conversations with your data and enhancing search capabilities.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>AI assistants</strong></h3><p>The growth of LLMs has led to the development of many AI assistants, each designed for specific tasks like pair programming, scheduling and making reservations. Ongoing research aims to create a universal assistant capable of assisting with a wide range of tasks. Examples of such assistants include <a href="https://pi.ai/talk">Pi</a> and ChatGPT.</p><h3><strong>Chatbots</strong></h3><p>You can create chatbots tailored to specific tasks, like answering user or customer questions by fine-tuning them on custom data. For example, one of our community members has built a <a href="https://flyte.org/blog/building-flytegpt-on-flyte-with-langchain">chatbot to address Flyte-related inquiries</a>.</p><p>What’s more, you have the flexibility to develop chatbots that mimic the speech patterns of various personas, such as game characters or celebrities. <a href="https://beta.character.ai/">Character.ai</a> is an intriguing example.</p><h3><strong>Generation</strong></h3><p>LLMs are trained to generate the next piece of text given some input text. You can use them to write stories, create marketing content or even generate code. They're great at understanding what comes next in a text, making them handy for all sorts of writing tasks.</p><h3><strong>Translation</strong></h3><p>An LLM excels at translation tasks, which are considered relatively straightforward for them. They can also handle more complex tasks like translating text into code. If you provide a user instruction to generate a code snippet in any programming language, an LLM should be able to generate the code for you. A popular example of such a model is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/08/code-llama-ai-for-coding/">Code Llama</a>.</p><h3><strong>Summarization</strong></h3><p>With LLMs, you can create applications that automatically summarize long documents, research papers, and meeting notes and articles, making information more accessible.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Search</strong></h3><p>LLMs are great at grasping natural language queries. Unlike simple keyword-based searches, LLM-powered search engines like <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-generative-ai-learning-features/">Google's generative AI search</a> and <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity AI</a> offer more relevant and context-aware results. These advancements have revolutionized real-time search capabilities.</p><p>These use cases represent just the tip of the iceberg; LLMs offer many more possibilities, including personalization, recommendation systems, interactive fiction, gaming and much more.</p><h2><strong>Putting LLMs to the test</strong></h2><p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> is the go-to choice for testing LLMs. However, if you're a fan of open-source solutions like we are, you might want to explore <a href="https://huggingface.co/chat/">HuggingChat</a>. Additionally, there's <a href="https://bard.google.com/">Google Bard</a> and other open-source LLMs available on Hugging Face spaces. These can be used as hosted applications or accessed programmatically through the API.</p><p>You can find a list of open-source LLMs on Hugging Face in the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard">Open LLM leaderboard</a>. These models are assessed using the <a href="https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness">Eleuther AI Language Model Evaluation Harness</a> framework, which evaluates generative language models across a wide range of tasks.</p><p>It's important to note that not all chatbots or applications use the same LLM. ChatGPT employs the GPT-series models, HuggingChat <em>currently</em> utilizes the <a href="https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-6-llama-30b-xor">OpenAssistant LLaMa 30B SFT 6</a> model, and Google Bard is <em>currently</em> powered by the <a href="https://ai.google/discover/palm2/">PaLM 2</a> model. It's worth noting that these models can change over time as newer, more efficient models are continually trained on larger datasets and improved model architectures.</p><h3><strong>How do LLMs differ?</strong></h3><p>An important question we need to address: What's the purpose of having multiple language models? It's important to note that LLMs are still an active area of research, and we haven't reached a point where we can rely on a single model for all tasks. Whether we will ever reach that stage remains uncertain. However, the community is actively working to discover the best models for various applications we intend to build upon and use.</p><p>The following are some key factors that contribute to the differences between LLMs:</p><h4><strong>Model architecture</strong></h4><p>LLMs can have different architectures depending on their objectives, computational resources and training tasks.</p><h4><strong>Data</strong></h4><p>The quality and amount of training data vary among models. PaLM 2, for instance, utilizes five times more data than its predecessor.</p><h4><strong>Parameter count</strong></h4><p>A higher parameter count indicates a more powerful model. For example, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters. Meta's <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">Llama 2</a> includes models ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.</p><h4><strong>Training objective</strong></h4><p>While some LLMs excel at text completion tasks, others are designed for specific use cases. For instance, MosaicML introduced the <a href="https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b-storywriter">StoryWriter</a> model, developed to read and write fictional stories with extended context lengths (65K tokens). At inference time, it can go beyond 65K tokens.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Computational resources</strong></h4><p>Some LLMs are designed to be resource-intensive for better performance, while others prioritize efficiency for faster inference or when resources are limited. For example, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/1/llama-2-mac/">Llama 2 can run on your Mac</a>.</p><h2><strong>What are prompts?</strong></h2><p>A prompt is the input given by a user, and the model responds based on that input. A prompt can be a question, a command or any kind of input, depending on what's needed for a particular use case.&nbsp;</p><div>

This approach aligns with the nature of pre-trained LLMs, which excel at text completion.</p><div>

However, the format can vary depending on the specific LLM you're using and the response you're aiming for. For instance, there's a detailed guide on how to <a href="https://replicate.com/blog/how-to-prompt-llama">prompt Llama 2</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Creating clear and effective prompts is crucial to achieve the results you want, a process known as prompt engineering.</p><h3><strong>Prompt engineering</strong></h3><p>Prompt engineering is all about coaxing the model into a region of its latent space by manipulating the input prompt so the probability distribution of the next-tokens it predicts matches your intent. In simpler terms, it means guiding the model to generate the desired output.</p><p>There are many ways of doing this, such as providing examples of the kinds of outputs you want, instructing the model to write “in the style of” certain authors, using chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling the model to use external tools, and more.</p><h3><strong>Zero-shot prompts</strong></h3><p>A prompt that doesn't provide specific examples for how the model should respond is called a “zero-shot prompt.” The flamingos prompt and the classification prompt are both examples of zero-shot prompts. Zero-shot prompts are effective in cases where the model understands the instruction.</p><h3><strong>Few-shot prompts</strong></h3><p>LLMs excel with zero-shot prompts but may struggle with complex tasks. Few-shot prompts, which include examples within the prompt, enable in-context learning. In this approach, the model learns from both the instructions and the provided examples to understand its task.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7ad98b0710b7a4b5bd_p5FGHZ4oQhjv46aTd2pkBcLbOrTpljqqFuCLK1nYDxkjO-vkC-B2YQ0vHD26xp4qibYyYyYvcmK4N5Zvtd6R_Qtg--JoomGJpj0AkW0LbYOSeft-k-pZanHyGIe2TVB6rhP0Y5HOgTAy2x7uNu4R-xs.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Vicuna 33B: Few-shot prompting&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a9e5946ce6be0da2f_JaZuPahPaKwejaT7XxcHuWed6EEiXwNjAmmaFxEA0utxXiSlaPNis24cARKD2iJnVytBTmgE34r9WPikAssIl2v2HATndM3mP_COb1B2bzCd1xTW6jhjd53X8-N1vQVgdeOGOB3FPZ2Lzs8t1Z4arC8.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>HuggingChat: Few-shot prompting</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Chain of thought (CoT) prompting</strong></h3><p>CoT prompting encourages the LLM to provide explanations for its reasoning. Combining it with few-shot prompting can yield improved results for more intricate tasks that demand prior reasoning before generating responses.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a2ef13c9c9ea4e49a_0DUqKmq_GlbM6o3Mo-T19l-lwOKhwHNdqPkz9Tv6NmkLxAYVRIdN1K-WIZJtyX5RLUBYdalFjrxkX5EAYd4kWJgjVcyRe-j9YOLNELdTr4wHv2gDhBgYdFVxYEuWHTwPgaEkh6jMZbeEM536d_00fyc.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Standard prompting vs CoT prompting (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The core concept behind CoT is that by presenting the LLM few-shot examples that include reasoning, it will subsequently incorporate the reasoning process into its responses when addressing prompts.</p><h4><strong>Let’s think step by step</strong></h4><p>Instead of including examples with reasoning in the prompt, you can achieve accurate answers by employing zero-shot prompting simply by adding "Let's consider step by step" to the end of the question. This approach has been demonstrated in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11916.pdf">Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners</a> paper to yield reliable results.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a2c0d5b9fc0b70522_sYkpR7MFfYX27TGzGSHXvAqeaNR_A3uc-SfHOfdB6ghzJCXz0zO1INi3QzlxXXkSslSud78f3u3zCCVuxHug09D5s4GoQlormtm0unE61sO-Q8iQTJmAAuIql_ceeVvOiEZASNej4K_hWBnruFpR8lk.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Zero-shot CoT (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11916.pdf">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>In-context learning (ICL)</strong></h2><p>In-context learning (ICL) entails providing context within prompts, which can be in the form of examples (few-shot prompting) or additional information. This approach empowers pre-trained LLMs to assimilate new knowledge.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7b00210dacf8dbaba5_prxmosontgXmGuQJ0WxEkacJwbStS50flJkzX13eJmTG1HbGiDkXzJ4pTMM1uEuu8epop2pRhNDnWA-kvJJgBSiQJHqt3g1wwLMunYF_21_t1w_t26BhzJgrmj-TwlnD9MyR_lB9rruBm-iTqmFscC4.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Teaching an LLM new information: HuggingChat</figcaption></figure><p>The categorization in this example can be easily understood — even at a glance, — because it represents a distinction between two- and four-wheelers. The LLM accurately categorizes based on the context provided in the prompt, showing its ability to infer. This approach can be extended to more-complex scenarios. For instance, a chatbot that interacts with data and incorporates context from provided documentation will be limited by the context window's size because it restricts the information you can include in the prompt. Fortunately, you can overcome this limitation by using vector databases.</p><h3><strong>Vector databases</strong></h3><p>Vector databases store context vectors or embeddings. If you want to input documents into your LLM, you must first convert the text into vectors and store them in a vector database. Later, these vectors can be used to provide “relevant” context within prompts to the LLM. Relevancy, referred to as <strong>semantic search</strong>, involves finding similarities between input queries and documents, both of which are represented as vectors. This allows us to fetch selectively from the vector database and provide relevant documents to the LLM without overwhelming the prompt context window.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7ac957a70292c794f4_598lLYbp9pdY6jShouCZuXQK_X_FxnWPxbFP_kkIv1WYnaispQMazodOxpKamY4jxYlvxAykrDIUFfLoFktBhlakfaIzsm1vCdpMfZp4ymOvSue0paxBzJte9QBCuXfr7ImAxTnarX5PRma9sc_cX44.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Semantic search (<a href="https://txt.cohere.com/what-is-semantic-search/">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Examples of vector databases include <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/">Pinecone</a>, <a href="https://www.trychroma.com/">ChromaDB</a> and <a href="https://weaviate.io/">Weaviate</a>.</p><p>The generic pipeline for semantic search and model prompting is as follows:</p><ol role="list"><li>Users input their query.</li><li>The query is embedded using identical embeddings as document vectors.</li><li>Semantic search retrieves the k-most similar documents from the vector database.</li><li>The output of semantic search, along with the user query, is sent to the model to generate a coherent response.</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a9358df9297a745c3_VcuXY6_891-FjYOPlzxwIQPzmMo4oLOfJE8vKFpK_Jo45mEuy6zTkmK0QoXKFoYqcQ7-8A8t43tOks7Xa1gicD6NZxmJRF4e7fICOmUG41PnaGASjezWGi9NbRZIZQGre3_BvIUs2-AqfWUEG5CMPTc.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Generic pipeline for in-context learning with semantic search (<a href="https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.langchain.com/">LangChain</a> is a popular tool to build context-aware applications on top of LLMs.</p><h3><strong>What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?</strong></h3><p>The documents stored in the vector database may not provide up-to-date information for your LLM to answer accurately. This limitation arises because the model's knowledge is restricted to the data it was trained on, which has a cutoff date. If you ask your model about recent events not included in its knowledge, it may produce inaccurate answers, a phenomenon often referred to as <strong>hallucination</strong>.</p><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving current context-specific information from an external database. This updated information is then fed into the LLM to generate accurate responses. RAG also enables the LLM to cite resources while generating responses.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>How does RAG differ from regular in-context learning?</strong></h4><p>RAG can be conceptualized as an online, in-context learning method. The process of generating vectors, storing them in a vector database and updating the index occurs in real time. This effectively addresses the recency issue commonly observed in LLM applications. For instance, you can write your code to ensure that whenever there's a data update, the indexing module upserts the data in the vector database.&nbsp;</p><p>RAG can be implemented through LangChain, HuggingFace, OpenAI and so on.</p><h2><strong>LLM parameters</strong></h2><p>When provided with a prompt, an LLM can generate a long list of potential responses. It operates like a prediction engine. However, in practice, LLMs typically provide a single output that represents the most likely response according to the model. The model calculates the probabilities of different words appearing in a response and returns only those words that meet the set parameters.</p><h3><strong>Model</strong></h3><p>The performance of a pre-trained LLM relies on its size: Larger models tend to produce higher-quality responses. However, bigger models increase costs and require more computational resources.</p><h3><strong>Temperature</strong></h3><p>Temperature influences the model's creativity. Lower temperatures yield consistent and predictable results, while higher temperatures introduce randomness, resulting in more creative outputs. At a temperature of 0, the model always produces the same output. However, with higher temperatures, the model outputs words associated with varying probabilities.</p><h3><strong>Top-p and Top-k</strong></h3><p>Top-p selection involves choosing tokens from the highest-probability options; the sum of their probabilities determine the selection. For example, if `p` is set to 0.15, the model will select tokens like “United” and”'Netherlands” because their combined probabilities add up to 14.7%.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a58abce2cf80c7ec4_3xuGN41Y7YS_FrN2v4e_OuSrPloFU9IR0BQCRDsrR6f6tzParykxZ31uazO5Z1njqicoXsfPWdmOBcmK3p5EGffZSKC_mT6AoBTJhD8r6Eobbkeu0MUYJ52aUPXixE2gqQ7g--T8lXCSHCiV5boZX08.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Top-p (<a href="https://txt.cohere.com/llm-parameters-best-outputs-language-ai/">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The lower the value of `p`, the more deterministic the responses generated by the model are. The general recommendation is to alter either temperature or top-p, but not both.</p><p>Top-k selection involves selecting the next token from the list of the highest `k` tokens, which are sorted by their probability. For instance, if `k` is set to 3, the model will choose from the top 3 options.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a85ec36671da4beed_LFlGG_lEIghK6EDT9JX6eRFV0OCeg5V3XU55bK6KOWfyK587162XIwJWp4qUwgSo6Maq2sELAh7x4lYmmwxB4rxwYZdti5WWVx4e-7amly4G-PQ-xFryT8ypOcwa5HIjlcIpGm92GutgTxd_bJgn61w.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Top-k (<a href="https://txt.cohere.com/llm-parameters-best-outputs-language-ai/">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Number of tokens</strong></h3><p>Tokens serve as the fundamental units of text in LLMs. A token doesn't always represent a single word; it can also encompass a group of characters. As a general rule of thumb, one token is roughly equivalent to four characters of English text.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a3a01cebbc6fede41_3kV3_EHVsIsvhqHiDvj68BpsPSwvyFIOv7RV8ZB6zfxJdulGqzsWT2kZDJHwZMc99Zhrstw29L3vEDyC7YiRSQC1AlS4KdvEf_AvzLRS002MFUD2El5-YnmS13FgiNhbgJF9HCOgcx6II0tjFRvIJJw.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The highlighted text corresponds to tokens. (<a href="https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The number of tokens in a model corresponds to the maximum number of input tokens the model can accept and the maximum number of output tokens it can produce. Typically, this number is set at 1,024, 2,048 or 4,096, but for some models, it can be even larger.</p><h3><strong>Stop sequences</strong></h3><p>Stop sequences can be employed to instruct the model to stop its token generation at a specific point, such as the end of a sentence or a list. It proves useful when you intend to stop token generation immediately upon encountering a stop sequence. This approach can be tailored to specific use cases or employed to reduce the cost of token generation.</p><h3><strong>Repetition penalty</strong></h3><p>Repetition penalty discourages the repetition of tokens that have appeared recently in the generated text. It encourages the model to produce more diverse tokens by reducing the likelihood of selecting tokens with higher scores.</p><p>When the repetition penalty is set to 1.0, there is no penalty applied. A value of 1.2 strikes a good balance between maintaining accuracy in generation and minimizing repetition, as described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05858.pdf">this paper</a>.</p><h2><strong>When to fine-tune?</strong></h2><p>Prompt engineering, with or without few-shot prompts and in-context learning, is suitable when the model needs data input. However, for scenarios requiring specific styles, patterns, specialized skills or internal model improvement, fine-tuning is a better choice. Fine-tuning involves updating model parameters through training on selected data, enhancing the model from within, while prompt engineering enhances the model externally. Fine-tuning is a more advanced technique, often requiring a substantial level of expertise in LLMs.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a85ec36671da4bee9_XFLTneVrI20STsazT3u69bQJtnNhytvSSqjYFNh5DXc9SHjnxgBsxnfPBuIHtvK0WL8No9Z835qaXq826WF48TtUQ7g-_CubAHjb69UvEErXoR7pKAsaRDn6CwVRA1QpS4XoFkfFWGCHCthGk80o0Rs.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The three fine-tuning approaches (<a href="https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/finetuning-large-language-models">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>In the feature-based approach, we load a pre-trained LLM, generate output embeddings for the training set and use them as input features to train a classifier. In fine-tuning I, the output layers are pre-trained, keeping the LLM frozen. In fine-tuning II, all model layers are updated — that’s expensive and requires a lot more compute power.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7ab6869df20b2f7310_L1lzUbREy9_abXbHFOfWJvvoC3-j1QySAl5JkpmLlhrwQt58VxGJ3ixT_xvTUcgIwbP_2WBesT_xkCELMKE3gQTztlcCEiMOlWY9N1Av4ugXO1OVuo7MUuv1jPM1gVJWfXL9C3d67wutg1y_GhYIqak.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Performance of pre-trained DistilBERT models fine-tuned on the IMDB Movie review dataset (<a href="https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/finetuning-large-language-models">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Updating all layers (fine-tuning II) yields better performance than updating only the output layers (fine-tuning I). This can be seen in the performance plot from an experiment conducted by the blog post author, Sebastian Raschka. The graph shows performance plateaus when training the last two layers and transformer blocks, with no improvement in accuracy between the final stages. In other words, performing a full parameter fine-tuning becomes inefficient in terms of computation resources and time.</p><h3><strong>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)</strong></h3><p>PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning) reuses a pre-trained model to reduce computational and resource requirements. PEFT encompasses techniques that fine-tune a limited number of model parameters while preserving accuracy. Examples of PEFT techniques include prompt tuning and low rank adaptation (LoRA).</p><h4><strong>Prompt tuning</strong></h4><p>Prompt tuning falls between prompt engineering and fine-tuning. Unlike fine-tuning, it doesn't modify the model parameters. Instead, it involves passing prompt embeddings along with each prompt sent to the model. Essentially, the model updates the prompt itself, creating what we call <strong>soft prompts</strong>. These soft prompts comprise embeddings, numeric representations derived from the larger model's knowledge. In contrast to <strong>hard prompts</strong>, which are manually crafted with discrete input tokens, soft prompts cannot be directly viewed or edited as text.</p><h4><strong>Low rank adaptation (LoRA)</strong></h4><p>Another popular PEFT technique is LoRA, which facilitates fine-tuning specific adapters loaded into the model. LoRA achieves this by transforming weights into a lower-dimensional space, effectively reducing computational and storage demands.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7aafb7a686d8643a80_VTe0h3y2KO_ScFQ4BweoovzGq_nm_xdECSxbcp4ynct9HtgwQu_uYm09j5RVIcSqYW8xErsn1nujOp50k8XeyzwfWgdtFkOZ_ybBcJzFeblbvVb1jgWB_FpTy1PlIHSde84RBNjp7CbSX1WBAXdp7mI.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Pretrained weights W are frozen while the trainable parameters A and B approximate the gradient update, ∆W (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf">Paper</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)</strong></h3><p>In RLHF, a pre-trained model is fine-tuned via a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning. Human feedback is collected by ranking or rating various model outputs, creating a reward signal. These reward labels train a reward model, which, in turn, guides the LLM’s adaptation to human preferences.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7aa204e991feec3a9a_SgR3MGQN8PV_rxDdoPawloL1aMOrdfU-kutd96ihVc4-EBKG-XA-dFCsZYbZAI-1bM4_jM60mpOXLEWUTpYmek7IjP2s3Cx6oSCWo-Qvodr_bcc2oXcL6Ww1E8os-scKENqu6FTFIuVq65vlFBsytXs.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>A typical RLHF pipeline</figcaption></figure><p>The reward model can be initialized from a supervised fine-tuning model (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned through supervised learning.

It is built on top of the <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers">transformers</a> library.</p><h2><strong>Optimization techniques for fine-tuning</strong></h2><p>To enhance fine-tuning efficiency, consider employing quantization and zero-redundancy optimization.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: This section is excerpted from Niels Bantilan’s blog post titled “<a href="https://www.union.ai/blog-post/fine-tuning-vs-prompt-tuning-large-language-models">Fine-Tuning vs. Prompt Engineering Large Language Models</a>” on Union.ai.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Quantization reduces memory utilization</strong></h3><p>Quantization is the process of reducing the precision of numerical data so it consumes less memory and increases processing speed. However, lower precision leads to lower accuracy because less information is being stored within each layer. This doesn’t just apply to neural networks; if you’re a data scientist or ML engineer who has used Numpy, Pandas or any other numerical library, you’ve probably encountered `float64`, `float32` and `float16` data types. The numbers 64, 32 and 16, respectively, indicate how many bits are used to represent, in this case, floating point numbers.</p><p>Deep learning frameworks like <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/amp_examples.html">PyTorch</a>, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/mixed_precision">TensorFlow</a> and <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/jmp">Jax</a>, commonly provide utilities to do mixed-precision training; this lets the framework automatically cast the weights, biases, activations and gradients to lower floating-point precision (e.g. float16) when appropriate, and then cast them to higher precision representations (e.g. float32) when numerical stability matters (for instance in gradient accumulation or loss scaling). One library that may be of interest to fine-tuners is the <a href="https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes">bitsandbytes</a> library, which uses 8-bit optimizers to reduce the memory footprint significantly during model training.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a7583bb32b0bb9207_fmaeYH7UD8eOrpmDv55DuubnHoj9kXUFkKWN2dKt4g1qvFMSsyZhKF92eicJfCryhoLuwiAKp5EyP9stqFYiM-nz0bp6DBo-u9pqHUFMKQUOIJwvLjTlGzFB8CE7uRrPqhjQBSCixHWg37A5YmWvKXg.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Converting an FP-16 vector to INT8 through quantization (<a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-bitsandbytes-integration#introduction-to-model-quantization">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Zero-redundancy optimization shards and offloads model state</strong></h3><p>A few years ago, the only sort of data parallelism that you could easily leverage with deep learning libraries consumed a lot of GPU memory. If you had a machine with four GPUs, you could replicate the model four times, and if you could train a batch size of 8 on each GPU, you would obtain an effective batch size of 32.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a9358df9297a7459f_0aW9iRLuTbXJ9QyE35YRzXID3pjvD59afhrq1U_9_9AA2gvlGKera8SDiGMRYU6bbKzLwtoIwJo18GWU74xuEJ3szLOWt1YCtUAZXqF32unos4K3qAlG4yw2iqaypNwQoLAvJvTQUDe8Dl6XDGYkM8k.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Conventional data parallelism maintains a full replica of the model across the available cores, allowing you to increase the effective batch size during training. (<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/15/open-source/fsdp/">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02054.pdf"> ZeRO paper</a>, which is available via<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed"> DeepSpeed</a> and Pytorch’s<a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html"> FSDP</a> implementation, enables you to shard the optimizer state, gradients and parameters across the available GPUs and CPUs in the training system. This is done in a layer-wise fashion, so only the model state required for a specific local forward/backward pass is replicated across GPUs. For example, if you’re training a neural net with three layers, the ZeRO protocol replicates the model state required for the forward pass of the first layer, freeing up memory once it obtains the activations. This is repeated in the forward passes for layers two and three. Finally, this process is applied to the backward passes, resulting in updates to the parameters of the model.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a87a474ff8229fb12_138XdFxUt2Ok4xbwlf46-k7bHYFLKjAYo63p8E-19o7W51m3aZEHNb3zFfb75cQqQlfr0WSDbINgNsy76DCfY6GMy5E_5jTLSESRAn8zLXi36wog1VXzrTotVyQdiaNSue-vIsKTXkICklq-shNfM7Y.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>ZeRO is a type of data parallelism that only loads the weights needed for a particular layer-wise forward/backward pass, so you never load a full model into memory. (<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/15/open-source/fsdp/">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The ZeRO framework also allows for offloading of model states to CPU or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVM_Express">NVMe</a> where appropriate, which further reduces GPU memory consumption and improves training speed.</p><h2><strong>What is hallucination in LLMs?</strong></h2><p>A hallucination in an LLM occurs when the model generates text that seems plausible but is actually incorrect or nonsensical. While <a href="https://bard.google.com/">Google Bard</a>, Perplexity AI, and <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&amp;showconv=1&amp;FORM=hpcodx">Bing Chat</a> show citations, they may reduce hallucinations to some extent but don't fully eliminate them.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a98bd2645ac8cb546_2oYfMA1IYxhebWoUqcNNgifKRQz0dovbka_dE8SfAfSr9GfcENkc0DoxcvbaN9eQL-vNa5XBbzV8wWb_51wwEU7nuljL02RjsG3phGSbOkyZjYZPwfN3WQBlsx5hCzoVvzTzbkQFnCMeh990LxGCMBU.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>ChatGPT got deceived! 😱(<a href="https://flyingbisons.com/blog/hallucinations-of-chatgpt-4-even-the-most-powerful-tool-has-a-weakness">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Why do LLMs hallucinate?</strong></h3><p>LLMs tend to hallucinate when they have an incomplete understanding of the prompt's context. In such cases, they may make educated guesses based on learned patterns. Hallucinations can also be a result of incomplete or incorrect training data. Since LLMs rely on their training data rather than real-world information, their outputs may sometimes be irrelevant. However, techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) can be employed to incorporate real-time information and mitigate this issue.</p><h3><strong>How can you reduce hallucinations?</strong></h3><p>Hallucination can be desirable in certain scenarios, such as when creative responses are needed, like in story writing or marketing content creation. However, when accuracy and factual information are required, hallucination becomes undesirable.</p><p>Here are ways to mitigate hallucinations:</p><ol role="list"><li>Prompt engineering: By including more contextual information in the prompt, the language model gains a better understanding of the context and can generate more appropriate responses.</li><li>In-context learning: When the model receives contextual information as part of the prompt, it has access to additional data that aids in generating accurate responses. A lack of context is a common cause of hallucinations.</li><li>Controlled generation: Imposing sufficient constraints in the prompt can restrict the model's freedom to produce hallucinatory content.</li></ol><p>However, it's important to note that hallucinations cannot always be completely eliminated. Models may still generate errors that are challenging to detect.</p><h2><strong>Running LLMs on local machines</strong></h2><p>Indeed, you heard correctly! You can run LLMs on your local machine to generate predictions. You can utilize <a href="https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm">Machine Learning Compilation (MLC)</a> for LLM or employ <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a> for the same purpose.</p><h3><strong>MLC</strong></h3><p>MLC enables the native deployment of any LLM through native APIs with compiler acceleration. It offers support for the following platforms and hardware:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a2c0d5b9fc0b70519_WftY87s-mCLRQ2vZLh2vlb05ZEmhFNAHbSBmMV88SkK6RmrT7HT_NT94F7Zo6ePrKy0eP72oXIxEkMznNQU-EGaK8N7j07aNio93WsxqG18mvRYdRPGAKxCbe5CAeRgRLHIRhzpH_m6XSSyWDa-pRUc.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Platforms and hardware supported by MLC</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>llama.cpp</strong></h3><p>llama.cpp empowers you to execute the Llama model using 4-bit integer quantization on a MacBook.
