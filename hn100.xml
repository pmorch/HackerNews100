<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_70">
<p>Bitcoin was never used by most Salvadorans, its modern city was never built, and now it will cease to be legal tender in El Salvador, the first country in the world to adopt it in 2021: a complete failed economic bet by President Nayib Bukele. Congress, dominated by the ruling party, approved last Wednesday a confusing reform to the Bitcoin Law at the request of Bukele’s government, which had no other option to receive the $1.4 billion credit agreed in December with the International Monetary Fund (<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IMF</a>).</p>



<p>The reform eliminated the word “currency” when referring to bitcoin, but says it is “<a href="https://ticotimes.net/2021/09/07/in-world-first-bitcoin-becomes-legal-tender-in-el-salvador" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal tender</a>.” Despite the lack of clarity, it lifts, as required by the IMF, the obligation to accept it in transactions or debt payments, a key condition for it to be “legal tender,” according to economic analysts. With the change, “if someone owes you money and wants to pay you in bitcoin, you can refuse to be paid in bitcoin, but you cannot refuse if it’s legal tender,” economist Carlos Acevedo explained.</p>



<p>The use of bitcoin in El Salvador’s dollarized economy, according to the new rule, will be optional and will be at the discretion of the private sector to accept cryptocurrency payments for goods and services. Businesses are no longer required to convert dollar prices into this cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin no longer has that force of legal tender. That’s how it should have always remained, but the government wanted to force it and it didn’t work,” economist Rafael Lemus said.</p>



<h2 id="h-very-complicated-and-risky"><strong>Very Complicated and Risky</strong></h2>



<p>The Bitcoin Law reform will take effect 90 days after it’s published in the Official Gazette, which could happen in the coming days. For Acevedo, former president of the former Central Bank, “it makes no sense” to have left in the reformed law that it is “legal tender.” “It’s a monstrosity that’s not understood and that should be corrected and made clear that bitcoin is no longer legal tender,” the economist argues.</p>



<p>But even being so, Salvadorans, with the exception of a few, never embraced Bukele’s initiative, who enjoys enormous popularity for his war against gangs, which dropped homicides to historic lows in El Salvador. A recent survey by the Central American University (UCA) revealed that 92% of Salvadorans did not use bitcoin in their transactions in 2024.</p>



<p>“I used it and didn’t like it… Very complicated and risky. This is not for an employee who barely gets by on their salary,” Juana Henríquez, a 55-year-old nurse, said, saying she had tried to make some profit and instead lost money. Bukele also failed to achieve his project, which he announced with fireworks, to create Bitcoin City, a high-tech city that would be the capital of bitcoiners in the country and would take energy for mining from a volcano in Conchagua, about 200 km from Salvador.</p>



<p>Berlin, a city 110 km east of San Salvador, and <a href="https://ticotimes.net/2025/01/31/trump-effect-drives-bitcoin-growth-in-small-el-salvador-town">El Zont</a><a href="https://ticotimes.net/2025/01/31/trump-effect-drives-bitcoin-growth-in-small-el-salvador-town" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e beach</a> (southwest) are two areas that concentrate bitcoiners, but many are foreign residents or tourists.</p>



<h2 id="h-government-reserves"><strong>Government Reserves</strong></h2>



<p>Bitcoin’s biggest promoter in the country, Bukele, has not yet referred to the legal reform. But officials ensure that the government will continue betting on this cryptocurrency, whose price currently exceeds $100,000. El Salvador’s ambassador to the United States, Milena Mayorga, told journalists Thursday, during a bitcoin event in San Salvador, that the law reforms should be seen as an adaptation “to the circumstances.”</p>



<p>The government, she assured, will continue buying bitcoin and having reserves in this cryptocurrency. According to the National Bitcoin Office, El Salvador has 6,050 bitcoins worth $634.8 million. “President Bukele continues buying bitcoin, we have a Bitcoin Office, we have the Bitcoin Law, bitcoin can be used in El Salvador. It hasn’t been an easy road,” Mayorga summarized.</p>



<p>For Lemus, because “the government has its bitcoin reserve and will buy more” it is necessary “to have transparency, for citizens to know how public funds are being invested.” Bukele recently said he is convinced that with Donald Trump – whom he supports – in the White House there will be “an exponential revaluation” of the cryptocurrency. He frequently posts price increases on his social networks. For now, he remains silent.</p>

<p>The Republican Senator from Missouri Josh Hawley has introduced a new bill that would make it illegal to import or export artificial intelligence products to and from China, meaning someone who knowingly downloads a Chinese developed AI model like the now immensely popular DeepSeek could face up to 20 years in jail, a million dollar fine, or both, should such a law pass.</p><p>Kevin Bankston, a senior advisor on AI governance at the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, told 404 Media it is “a broad attack on the very idea of scientific dialogue and technology exchange with China around AI, with potentially ruinous penalties for AI researchers and users alike and deeply troubling implications for the future of online speech and freedom of scientific inquiry.”</p><p>Hawley <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-introduces-legislation-to-decouple-american-ai-development-from-communist-china/?ref=404media.co"><u>introduced the legislation</u></a>, titled the Decoupling America’s Artificial Intelligence Capabilities from China Act, on Wednesday of last year.&nbsp;</p><p>“Every dollar and gig of data that flows into Chinese AI are dollars and data that will ultimately be used against the United States,” Senator Hawley said in a statement. “America cannot afford to empower our greatest adversary at the expense of our own strength. Ensuring American economic superiority means cutting China off from American ingenuity and halting the subsidization of CCP innovation.”</p><p>Hawley’s statement explicitly says that he introduced the legislation because of the release of DeepSeek, an advanced AI model that’s competitive with its American counterparts, and which its developers claimed was made for a fraction of the cost and without access to as many and as advanced of chips, though these claims are unverified. Hawley’s statement called DeepSeek “a data-harvesting, low-cost AI model that <a href="https://outreach.senate.gov/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?cid=SenHawley&amp;crop=14331QQQ9477525QQQ8249110QQQ8019990&amp;report_id=&amp;redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fpolitics%2Fdeepseek-fallout-gop-sen-josh-hawley-seeks-cut-off-all-us-china-collaboration-ai-development%3Fintcmp%3Dtw_fnc&amp;redir_log=286219651778979&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>sparked</u></a> international concern and sent American technology stocks plummeting.”&nbsp;</p><p>Hawley’s statement says the goal of the bill is to “prohibit the import from or export to China of artificial intelligence technology, “prohibit American companies from conducting AI research in China or in cooperation with Chinese companies,” and “Prohibit U.S. companies from investing money in Chinese AI development.”</p><p>Hawley’s bill and its aims were covered credulously on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/deepseek-fallout-gop-sen-josh-hawley-seeks-cut-off-all-us-china-collaboration-ai-development?ref=404media.co"><u>Fox News</u></a>, but even if you think the bill’s goals are worth pursuing the actual <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hawley-Decoupling-Americas-Artificial-Intelligence-Capabilities-from-China-Act.pdf?ref=404media.co"><u>language of the bill</u></a> is broad and dystopian. Unlike legislators who fearmongered about TikTok and wanted to ban it, Hawley’s bill would criminalize the activity of average users, millions of whom downloaded DeepSeek recently, making it one of the most popular apps on the Apple App store.&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, the bill prohibits “the importation into the United States of artificial intelligence or generative artificial intelligence technology or intellectual proprietary developed or produced in the People’s Republic of China.” Those who violate this&nbsp; “Shall be subject to the criminal penalties set forth in subsection (b) of section 1760 of the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (50 U. S.C, 4819).”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title50-section4819&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>That law states that</u></a> “A person who willfully commits, willfully attempts to commit, or willfully conspires to commit, or aids and abets in the commission of, an unlawful act described in subsection (a) (1) shall be fined not more than $1,000,000; and (2) in the case of the individual, shall be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both.”</p><p>the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology’s Bankston told me that he’s skeptical that there would be strong criminal cases against someone who unintentionally downloaded an app like DeepSeek because the legislation specifies a person’s conduct must be “willful” for the imposition of criminal penalties, the bill is still “worrisomely broad.”&nbsp;</p><p>“It appears that it *could* apply to someone who downloaded DeepSeek knowing that it was from China, and yes, the criminal penalty for that under this proposal would be up to one million dollars or 20 years in prison (and also potentially civil penalties as well, which may require less proof of state of mind and may potentially even reach a mere accidental ‘importer’ of a Chinese model),” Bankston said.</p><p>The bill, which also prohibits the “transfer of research,” could create an unworkable environment for computer scientists who make their research public, and regularly read AI papers published by Chinese researchers.&nbsp;</p><p>“Beyond just impacting people downloading models from China, the bill's penalties for the import to or export from China of AI technology and intellectual property could also potentially extend to anyone who publishes AI models or research papers on the open internet knowing they will be downloaded by people in China,” Bankston said. “Researchers are also threatened by the second half of the bill, which would directly outlaw American collaboration with researchers at basically any Chinese university or company—with a fine of up to 100 million dollars for any company that violates the prohibition, amongst other penalties.”</p><p>"The bill threatens the development and publishing of AI advancements in the United States, and we're particularly worried about the impact on open and collaborative development of these technologies outside the proprietary systems of the Big Tech incumbents," Kit Walsh, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Director of AI and Access-to-Knowledge Legal Projects, told me. "In the past, the government has argued that merely publishing information on the internet counts as an export, and interpreting this law in such a way would further solidify the dominance of proprietary AI over open or academic research. The law would also interfere with efforts at AI accountability, such as transparency requirements that states and members of Congress have sought to create in order to make sure that AI isn't harming people in the United States when used for decisions about such wide-ranging things as housing, health care, and hiring."</p><p>On its face, the bill seems mostly like hawkish posturing from Hawley, and the language of the bill seems unworkable given the current state of computer science, the AI industry, and the culture of researchers sharing their work. However, there is bipartisan support for legislation that targets China wherever it appears able to topple American dominance. Banning TikTok also seemed like a ludicrous notion at first given its popularity among Americans, and while the app is still live, a bill banning it did pass both the house and the Senate and was signed by the president.&nbsp;</p><p>Hawley’s office did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p><em>Update: This article has been updates with comment from the EFF.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <h3 dir="auto">Summary</h3>
<p dir="auto">Google Security Team has identified a security vulnerability in some AMD Zen-based CPUs. This vulnerability allows an adversary with local administrator privileges (ring 0 from outside a VM) to load malicious microcode patches. We have demonstrated the ability to craft arbitrary malicious microcode patches on Zen 1 through Zen 4 CPUs. The vulnerability is that the CPU uses an insecure hash function in the signature validation for microcode updates.  This vulnerability could be used by an adversary to compromise confidential computing workloads protected by the newest version of AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization, SEV-SNP or to compromise Dynamic Root of Trust Measurement.</p>
<p dir="auto">AMD SEV-SNP users can verify the fix by confirming TCB values for SNP in their attestation reports (can be observed from a VM, consult <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-3019.html" rel="nofollow">AMD's security bulletin</a> for further details).</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Severity</h3>
<p dir="auto">HIGH - Improper signature verification in&nbsp;AMD CPU ROM microcode patch loader may allow an attacker with local administrator privilege to load malicious CPU microcode resulting in loss of confidentiality and integrity of a confidential guest running under AMD SEV-SNP.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Proof of Concept</h3>
<p dir="auto">A test payload for Milan and Genoa CPUs that makes the RDRAND instruction return 4 can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/google/security-research/tree/master/pocs/cpus/entrysign">here</a> (applying it requires the user to be root from outside of a VM).</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Timeline</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Date reported</strong>:  September 25, 2024<br>
<strong>Date fixed</strong>:  December 17, 2024<br>
<strong>Date disclosed</strong>:  February 3, 2025</p>
<p dir="auto">Google notified AMD of this vulnerability on September 25, 2024. AMD subsequently provided an embargoed fix to its customers on December 17, 2024. To coordinate with AMD, we made a one-off exception to our standard <a href="https://about.google/appsecurity" rel="nofollow">vulnerability disclosure policy</a> and delayed public disclosure until today, February 3, 2025. This joint disclosure occurs 46 days after AMD shared the fix with its customers and 131 days after Google's initial report. Due to the deep supply chain, sequence and coordination required to fix this issue, we will not be sharing full details at this time in order to give users time to re-establish trust on their confidential-compute workloads. We will share additional details and tools on March 5, 2025.</p>

<p dir="auto">View the HTTP and HTTPS requests made by any linux program by running <code>httptap -- &lt;command&gt;</code>. For example, the following runs curl on "monasticacademy.org", which results in an HTTP status of 308 (Redirect):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ httptap -- curl https://monasticacademy.org
---> GET https://monasticacademy.org/
<--- 308 https://monasticacademy.org/ (15 bytes)"><pre>$ httptap -- curl https://monasticacademy.org
---<span>&gt;</span> GET https://monasticacademy.org/
<span>&lt;</span>--- 308 https://monasticacademy.org/ (15 bytes)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Now let's try the same thing with an HTTP request from python. This time we see that python follows the redirect and gets a 200 OK response:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="httptap -- python -c &quot;import requests; requests.get('https://monasticacademy.org')&quot;
---> GET https://monasticacademy.org/
<--- 308 https://monasticacademy.org/ (15 bytes)
---> GET https://www.monasticacademy.org/
<--- 200 https://www.monasticacademy.org/ (5796 bytes)"><pre>httptap -- python -c <span><span>"</span>import requests; requests.get('https://monasticacademy.org')<span>"</span></span>
---<span>&gt;</span> GET https://monasticacademy.org/
<span>&lt;</span>--- 308 https://monasticacademy.org/ (15 bytes)
---<span>&gt;</span> GET https://www.monasticacademy.org/
<span>&lt;</span>--- 200 https://www.monasticacademy.org/ (5796 bytes)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To run <code>httptap</code> you do not need to be the root user. You do not need to set up any kind of daemon or make any system-wide changes to your system. It will not create any iptables rules or change your routing table, and generally will not affect any other processes running on the same system. The <code>httptap</code> executable is a static Go binary that runs without dependencies.</p>
<p dir="auto">Httptap only runs on linux at present. It makes use of linux-specific system calls -- in particular network namespaces -- that will unfortunately make it very difficult to port to other operating systems. If you know how httptap could be ported to other operating systems then please get in touch!</p>

<p dir="auto">Let's run a simple test:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="httptap -- curl -s https://buddhismforai.sutra.co -o /dev/null
---> GET https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/
<--- 302 https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/ (117 bytes)"><pre>httptap -- curl -s https://buddhismforai.sutra.co -o /dev/null
---<span>&gt;</span> GET https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/
<span>&lt;</span>--- 302 https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/ (117 bytes)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">What happened here is that we ran <code>curl -s https://buddhismforai.sutra.co -o /dev/null</code> and it received a 302 redirect from the server. <code>httptap</code> printed summaries of the HTTP requests and their responses. Let's see how it changes if we tell curl to follow redirects by adding <code>-L</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="httptap -- curl -sL https://buddhismforai.sutra.co -o /dev/null
---> GET https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/
<--- 302 https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/ (117 bytes)

<span>&lt;</span>--- 200 https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/space/cbodvy/content (6377 bytes)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Now we can see that after receiving the 302 redirect, curl made an additional HTTP request to the URL to which it was redirected, which is what you expect when using <code>-L</code> with curl.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's see what HTTP endpoints the Google Cloud command line interface uses to list compute resources (this requires that you have gcloud installed and are signed in):</p>

<p dir="auto">What happened here is that we ran <code>gcloud compute instances list</code>, which lists the compute instances that the signed-in user has on Google Cloud. The bottom two lines of output were printed by <code>gcloud</code>; the rest were printed by <code>httptap</code> and show what HTTP requests <code>gcloud</code> used to get the information it printed.</p>

<p dir="auto">In the above, <code>--insecure-skip-tls-verify</code> is necessary because kubectl doesn't use the httptap-generated certificate authority, and <code>--https 443 6443</code> says to treat TCP connections on ports 443 and 6443 as HTTPS connections, which is needed because my cluter's API endpoint uses port 6443.</p>

<p dir="auto">Here the <code>--head</code> option tells httptap to print the HTTP headers, and <code>--body</code> tells it to print the raw HTTP payloads. To keep it short I'm showing just the first request/response pair.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How it works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When you run <code>httptap -- &lt;command&gt;</code>, httptap runs <code>&lt;command&gt;</code> in an isolated network namespace, injecting a certificate authority created on-the-fly in order to decrypt HTTPS traffic. Here is the process in detail:</p>
<p dir="auto">In linux, there is a kernel API for creating and configuring network interfaces. Conventionally, a network interface would be a physical ethernet or WiFi controller in your computer, but it is possible to create a special kind of network interface called a TUN device. A TUN device shows up to the system in the way that any network interface shows up, but any traffic written to it will be delivered to a file descriptor held by the process that created it. Httptap creates a TUN device and runs the subprocess in an environment in which all network traffic is routed through that device.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is also a kernel API in linux for creating network namespaces. A network namespace is a list of network interfaces and routing rules. When a process is started in linux, it can be run in a specified network namespace. By default, processes run in a root network namespace that we do not want to make chagnes to because doing so would affect all network traffic on the system. Instead, we create a network namespace in which there are only two network interfaces: a loopback device (127.0.0.1) and a TUN device that delivers traffic to us. Then we run the subprocess in that namespace.</p>
<p dir="auto">The traffic from the network device is delivered to us as raw IP packets. We must parse the IP packets as well as the inner TCP and UDP packets, and write raw IP packets back to the subprocess. This requires a software implementation of the TCP/IP protocol, which is by far the most difficult part of httptap. The TCP/IP implementation in httptap is missing many aspects of the full TCP protocol, but still works reasonably well for its purpose.</p>
<p dir="auto">Suppose the subprocess makes an HTTP request to <a href="http://www.example.com/" rel="nofollow">www.example.com</a>. The first thing we receive is a TCP SYN packet addressed to 93.184.215.14 (the current IP address of example.com). We respond with a SYN+ACK packet with source address 93.184.215.14, though in truth the packet did not come from 93.184.215.14, but from us. Separately, we establish our own TCP connection to 93.184.215.14 using the ordinary sockets API in the linux kernel. When the subprocess sends data to 93.184.215.14 we relay it over our separate TCP connection, and vice versa for return data. This is a traditional transparent TCP proxy, and in this way we can view all data flowing to and from the subprocess, though we won't be able to decrypt HTTPS traffic without a bit more work.</p>
<p dir="auto">When a client makes an HTTPS request, it asks the server for evidence that it is who it says it is. If the server has a certificate signed by a certificate authority, it can use that certificate to prove that it is who it says it is. The client will only accept such a certificate if it trusts the certificate authority that signed the certificate. Operating systems, web browsers, and many other pieces of software come with a list of a few hundred certificate authorities that they trust. Many of these pieces of software have ways for users to add additional certificate authorities to this list. We make use of this.</p>
<p dir="auto">When httptap starts, it creates a certificate authority (actually a private key plus a corresponding x509 certificate), writes it to a file on the filesystem visible only to the subprocess, and sets a few environment variables -- again only visible to the subprocess being run -- that add this certificate authority to the list of trusted certificate authorities. Since the subprocess trusts this certificate authority, and httptap holds the private key for the certificate authority, it can prove to the subprocess that it is the server which which the subprocess was trying to communicate. In this way we can read the plaintext HTTP requests.</p>

<p dir="auto">Httptap is part of an experiment in developing technology in the context of Buddhist monasticism. It was developed at the <a href="https://www.monasticacademy.org/" rel="nofollow">Monastic Academy</a> in Vermont in the US. We believe that a monastic schedule, and the practice of the Buddhist spiritual path more generally, provide ideal conditions for technological development. The way we have set things up is that we live and practice together on a bit over a hundred acres of land. In the mornings and evenings we chant and meditate together, and for about one week out of every month we run and participate in a meditation retreat. The rest of the time we work together on everything from caring for the land, maintaining the buildings, cooking, cleaning, planning, fundraising, and for the past few years developing software together. This project is a demonstration of what is possible on the software side, but of course to see the full product of our work you should come visit us.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you're interested, we run an <a href="https://www.monasticacademy.org/ai-fellowship" rel="nofollow">AI fellowship program</a>, which is a funded month-to-month program where you live on the land, participate in the schedule, and do your own work during the day. We also have a 3-month <a href="https://www.monasticacademy.org/train" rel="nofollow">monastic training program</a>, which can lead into our long-term residential training.</p>
<p dir="auto">For the past few years we have been recording a lecture series called <a href="https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/" rel="nofollow">Buddhism for AI</a>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.brainbun.com/blog/i-conditioned-myself-to-fail/">https://www.brainbun.com/blog/i-conditioned-myself-to-fail/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42919788">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-bvzihdzo=""> <article data-astro-cid-bvzihdzo="">  <div data-astro-cid-bvzihdzo="">   <p>Over the years I’ve literally built hundreds of projects. Some with a lof of potential. Others just batshit crazy ideas.</p>
<p>I started noticing a pattern. I’d build a project for several weeks or even months. Working long hours, maybe 12-14 hours a day. Being extremely motivated. I’d then launch the project, do one day of marketing, for example by posting on hackernews, producthunt and reddit.</p>
<p>Then, I’d inevitably lose interest completely. I would go from “this is the best thing I’ve ever built, it’s gonna change the world” to “this is never going to work, why would anyone ever want to use this” in the span of less than a day.</p>
<p>And I’d just give up on that project and move on.</p>
<p>It’s so weird. I tried figuring out why this was happening. I’d think like OK I’m just spending too much time building without validating the market. I just need to work on smaller project or even just landing pages. But every time the result would be the same. I lose interest after launch.</p>
<p>I thought to myself, right, it must be my fear of failure or my fear of rejection. I can’t handle criticism etc. But then I would look at my life and it can’t really be that. Sometimes I’m definitely too proud to take criticism, but even if there were zero reactions, I’d still lose interest. So it couldn’t be that.</p>
<p>Today I think I finally figured out what’s causing it.</p>
<p>I became an information junkie over the years.</p>
<p>That’s right, I’m addicted to information. I get my dopamine from feedback, from new information.</p>
<p>When I’m building something, that information is the thing coming to life in front of my eyes, every new button etc is awesome. I can see the changes in the UI from the code I’m writing.</p>
<p>But then when I launch, I either don’t get much feedback at all, or I get a lot of feedback for a day, which then dies down completely after the launch.</p>
<p>And I can’t find the motivation to get back to work.</p>
<p>The harsh reality is that most products fail and due to so many failed attempts, I kind of internalised that I’m doing effort for nothing.</p>
<p>But then whenever there’s a sale or a positive comment, I get another small jolt of motivation and I can build a bit again.</p>
<p>But I can’t really seem to get over the slog of finding product market fit without this feedback loop.</p>
<p>I think when I was younger, more naive and less information addicted, it was different.</p>
<p>I partly blame the algorithmic feeds a la Twitter/X. It’s a lot easier to get your dopamine from reading than it is from building.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has become a powerful framework for improving complex problem-solving capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, the verbose nature of textual reasoning introduces significant inefficiencies. In this work, we propose $\textbf{Heima}$ (as hidden llama), an efficient reasoning framework that leverages reasoning CoTs at hidden latent space. We design the Heima Encoder to condense each intermediate CoT into a compact, higher-level hidden representation using a single thinking token, effectively minimizing verbosity and reducing the overall number of tokens required during the reasoning process. Meanwhile, we design corresponding Heima Decoder with traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) to adaptively interpret the hidden representations into variable-length textual sequence, reconstructing reasoning processes that closely resemble the original CoTs. Experimental results across diverse reasoning MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that Heima model achieves higher generation efficiency while maintaining or even better zero-shot task accuracy. Moreover, the effective reconstruction of multimodal reasoning processes with Heima Decoder validates both the robustness and interpretability of our approach.

I'm recently available after nearly 20 years of Fortune 100 operations, migrations, and project stabilizations at scale.  I'm great at running extremely large and complex projects smoothly, and while I've focused on the Microsoft stack during my tenure at Avanade (joint Microsoft/Accenture venture), I am also skilled and knowledgeable with Linux, networking, hardware, and storage.  My experience includes over a decade of effectively working with and managing truly global teams across NA, LATAM, EU, and APAC.</p><p>My ideal position would be an IT Director lead where I can help a company really scale and apply concepts used by enterprise clients.  I've also run sales operations at a very large scale, so I am comfortable and extremely experienced at solutions architecture as well.</p><p>When not working, I enjoy cooking and 3d printing, sharing my designs for the latter (some of them have made hackernews!).</p></div></td></tr>

I’m a developer with a passion for building and problem-solving that extends far beyond the code I write. I bring a hands-on, creative approach to everything I do – whether it’s designing and building custom tiny homes out of buses and vans, or developing innovative solutions to everyday challenges. I have experience in welding, woodworking, electronics, and mechanical design, and I thrive on finding unique ways to merge technology and sustainability. From turning discarded materials into functional objects to powering my workshop entirely off the grid, I’m always looking for ways to reduce waste and make a positive environmental impact.</p><p>Outside of development, I enjoy diving into projects that allow me to combine my technical skills with my creative side – whether that’s composing music, crafting custom upholstery, or designing quirky contraptions for an annual race of pedal-powered sculptures. My background as a technician running cables and setting up networks also means I’m highly adaptable and comfortable in hands-on, fast-moving environments. Ultimately, I’m a maker at heart, and I love bringing fresh, practical solutions to any challenge I encounter.</p></div></td></tr>

As a Sr. Software Engineer &amp; Web-developer primarily working with Python frameworks. I am comfortable wearing many hats, and have worked through small to large sized projects for different sized clients (small to enterprise), building tech both on the Back &amp; Front-end as well as Infra.
I am currently looking for an AI or LLM company to work with. I have worked with clients in AI since 2022 - and am currently spending several hours per day experimenting with AI &amp; LLMs. From getting my hands dirty with the latest models and papers, to working on small applications that use AI. Especially when it comes to agentive apps (read: function calling or code writing-and-executing models), real world simulations (simulating 1000s of interactions with LLMs) or forecasting with LLMs. I have a few exploratory side-projects to show. And a huge amount of passion for the subject matter (productizing AI &amp; LLMS) to bring to the table. AI-Stack keywords: LangChain, LLamaIndex, AutoML, MLFlow, AG2 (formerly Autogen), TinyTroupe, Oasis</p></div></td></tr>

Hi, my name is Jeremiah. I'm looking to join a team where I can contribute significantly to a product and solve interesting problems. I am always eager to learn new skills, grow, and tackle new challenges.</p><p>I just finished three years of work at a learning startup called Pivot Interactives, which Discovery Education acquired. While working for Pivot Interactives, I was a full-stack web developer on a team of four developers implementing features from the design phase to deployment. I created easy-to-use and accessible tools for teachers and students to supplement high-school-level science labs by serving students with thousands of videos and assignments daily. This included integrations with learning platforms, custom WYSIWYG editor components, auto-grading, and student testing systems.</p><p>Before Pivot Interactives, I was a senior software development engineer at Corning Inc., creating hardware/software that quality-controlled billions of consumer electronic devices. I also wrote tools for scientists to interface with custom-made hardware and commercially available equipment. (DAQs, Motor Controllers, Liquid Crystal polarizers, industrial automation systems, etc.)</p><p>Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!</p></div></td></tr>

I have more than 10 years of experience in the software and marketing aspects of B2B/B2C e-commerce (Europe &amp; US). For the past 2 years, I took a deep dive into D2C as a Technical Co-Founder of a fragrance-related brand (<a href="https://yuma.gr/" rel="nofollow">https://yuma.gr</a>), successfully positioning us in the premium market at the lowest cost possible, by developing the e-commerce and ERP platform in-house.</p><p>I can handle all aspects of e-commerce with a focus on growth. Examples include:</p><p>- Extensive Google &amp; Facebook Ads automation at scale via their APIs</p><p>- Distributed bots for scraping millions of SKUs daily for dynamic pricing</p><p>- Deep &amp; proven knowledge of e-commerce &amp; ERP architecture &amp; development</p><p>- Complex and custom-made solutions (e.g., in-house developed Klaviyo alternative)</p><p>- Creative approaches to streamlining internal operations</p><p>- Frontend performance &amp; SEO micro-optimization</p><p>- Landing page optimization for conversions</p><p>I prefer long-term commitments and typically work on projects for 6 months to 1 year, as I treat each project as my own. Having developed my D2C brand to a technical level that now requires only maintenance and marketing, my schedule has become more flexible. I'm ready to help companies in different markets while expanding my skills and knowledge.</p></div></td></tr>

- Full-stack experience: We can cover everything from back-end architecture to front-end implementation and product design.
- Proven collaboration: We've got a history of working well together and delivering results, especially in fast-paced environments.
- User-focused approach: We are all about building products that users actually love.
- We can help with strategic planning, team structures, and career growth. We also like to automate tasks.</p><p>Key points to consider:
We're looking to be hired as a team, not individually. We're not a company, just a group of folks who love working together and have a proven track record of success. We want to work at a product-focused company where we can make a real business and user impact.</p><p>If you need a team that can hit the ground running and help you grow, get in touch!

The listed technologies are in no particular order, nor are they comprehensive. I'm most experienced in game development related fields (think Unity, Godot, C#, OpenGL, shaders, etc.), but I've worked in lots of different roles in the past and I'm always looking to learn new things. My ideal role would be something "high-impact", as in "I make things that have real-world results". If you have any questions about me or my background, feel free to shoot me an email.

    Technologies: Pretty equally split over the years between .NET + Node backends but I've done Java, Python and PHP at a few companies. For frontend I've used both Angular and React plus a few lesser known javascript frameworks here and there. SQL Server or Postgres for database, and AWS or Azure for cloud.
    Résumé/CV: https://www.linkedin.com/in/thekenwarner/
    Email: thekenwarner@gmail.com

    I'm looking for engineering leadership roles where I can have a strong impact on technical excellence, team culture, process, product and ultimately customer satisfaction and the organization's success. Happy to be hands-on if and when needed, but also ready to focus on higher level objectives if that's where I'm most needed and effective. For the last year or so I've been working on some solo/duo-preneur projects in the content creation space, and prior to that I was Engineering Manager for a small SaaS company where I also led DevOps for one of our corporate siblings. I also have held roles such as Director of Engineering for two edtech companies, Platform Architect for a chatbot startup and also lead engineer for a presidential campaign.</code></pre></div></td></tr>

I was previously an adjunct lecturer in the computer science department at Hunter College. I taught the capstone project course, where I supervised student groups on their final projects for the degree. This was an interesting experience because I effectively got to oversee an estimated 3-4K combined human hours of coding per semester.</p><p>I spend a majority of my free time programming to learn and keep rounding out my computer science knowledge -- I think coding something up is a great way to truly understand the topic. Currently I am fascinated with databases, and I am writing an RDBMS from scratch in OCaml. I have implemented low level file management operations, buffer pool and transaction management, pipelined query processing, a disk backed B+ tree, and a simple parser/interpreter that ties in with the query processing engine. This project is released as a pedagogical tool for others who want to do database hacking in OCaml.</p><p>I am currently writing up a series of posts on how I designed the disk backed B+ tree and implemented it:

Hi HN! I'm Brett. I've spent the last decade+ working on infrastructure and operations for software development and delivery. I am intensely user focused, whether they are internal developers or end-users, I listen to understand their needs to prioritize effectively. I stay curious about new technologies, but I most often lean on proven solutions to drive solutions to real-world problems.</p><p>I have worked with many technologies, but my experience has led me most recently to appreciate:</p><pre><code>  - Cloud-native approach to CI/CD (Container builds, GitHub Actions, FluxCD)
  - Observability tools (Grafana, Prometheus, Loki)
  - Kubernetes - in conjunction with IaC (Terraform), and GitOps (I have a Certified Kubernetes Aministrator (CKA) certification from the Linux Foundation)
</code></pre><p>
I've done my best work remotely for 10 years and am looking for a remote-first opportunity. I would love to solve problems and delight some users with a like minded team!</p><p>Thanks!</p></div></td></tr>

Physically, I quit drinking coffee and alcohol and smoking weed, started running 20+ miles a week and ran my first half-marathon for fun, and put on a good amount of muscle mass with a solid lifting routine and a clean diet.

My ideal would be to find myself working for a bootstrapped, profitable company of 50-100 people under a technical founder, writing in TypeScript while leading a team of 4-6, and growing into leading multiple teams after gaining an understanding of the business and influence with my peers.</p><p>Thanks for your time!</p></div></td></tr>

  Remote: yes
  Willing to relocate: Generally no, except to the US.

</code></pre><p>
EU-citizen developer with about a decade of experience, mostly from QA field and creating embedded Linux solutions, mostly including Yocto. Active OSS contributor, and also maintainer of a few projects (though nothing big-name). 
Looking for a reason to learn Rust. I really like working with Qt (especially on desktop), but I'm not too good at making things visually pleasing without close guidance from a designer who has good eyes... I'm more of a low-level/backend guy, who really enjoys the endorphin-wave that comes after a weeks long struggle, making a BSP come together successfully.</p><p>I have worked for years for multiple banks on different banking software before I realized my mistake of ever sending my CV there. Before banks, and after banks I have worked on developing gadgets running Linux/Yocto and firmware written with Zephyr.</p><p>Looking for a position where I can hack on embedded Linux and/or microcontrollers, but that's just preference, not a must - what I'm really looking for is a place where I, as a developer can make a real impact, and also, a place that values quality software: not only from technical perspective, but from the user's PoV too.</p><p>Primarily looking in Zurich and in its neighboring cantons, but ultimately I'm willing to commute up to an hour to get to your place. I can work from home, but I am definitely not against working from an office either.
If you are willing to sponsor a US visa, I could even jump across the pond.</p><p>My German is conversational. We can talk and write a lot in German, but I'm most confident in English.</p></div></td></tr>

I've worked in software since ~2011 and have worked with many tech stacks during that time- from PHP to Scala and Next.js to Rails. I've been fully remote since 2016 and have hired and managed globally remote team members at multiple companies.</p><p>While I've spent the majority of my career in venture-funded b2b SaaS, I'm highly-interested in working with bootstrapped companies who are hiring AI engineers to solve important problems. Bonus points if the use-case for AI is connected with the physical world in some way. I'm one of the folks who expect that artificial intelligence will continue to revolutionize our industry in many unexpected ways and I'm highly interested in working with a team of AI engineers who are breaking ground in the space.</p><p>Over the holidays I built a Rails application (I hadn't built with Rails in a while) that analyzes satellite imagery along US coastlines to visually identify potential boat anchorages using space imagery. It works by taking in geographic coordinates (geojson), fetching satellite images from Google Maps for the corresponding points, and using a fine-tuned machine learning model to classify areas that are likely suitable anchorages. I added a built-in interface for training (SFT) the ML with new data.</p><p>On the dev side, I generally prefer buying over building, readable over concise, fast over perfect, and empathy over all.</p><p>On the management side, my approach centers on 1:1s, transparent retros, and fostering a deep understanding of the business purpose behind the work we do. If this sounds like the type of culture that you have or wish to build, I'd love to hear from you and learn how I can support your mission and the team helping you accomplish it.</p></div></td></tr>

Email: jandrewmcentire@gmail.com</p><p>With 25+ years of experience in technology and 11+ in leadership roles spanning software architecture, operations, and team management, I have cultivated a career focused on building scalable systems, solving complex problems, and fostering high-performing, cohesive teams. My leadership style centers on measurable results that align with both customer and company needs, blending strategic vision with technical expertise.</p><p>Accomplishments and Expertise:
* Team Building and Leadership: Scaled teams from zero to 12 direct reports and later managed a 40+ person product and engineering organization, splitting the group into three specialized teams to align with business needs. Successfully hired and mentored managers to lead these teams, developed overseas and remote teams, and maintained strong engagement and efficiency in distributed environments.
* Multi-Cloud Strategy: Designed and implemented multi-cloud strategies across AWS, GCP, and Azure to ensure scalability, cost optimization, and system reliability. Balanced vendor lock-in risks with business needs, enabling high availability and flexibility.
* Scaling and Developing Teams: Successfully scaled engineering teams to meet rapid growth demands by leveraging internal hires, external agencies, and outsourcing partners. Built a sustainable and adaptable structure by hiring and developing technical leaders, including Engineering Managers, Architects, and Principal Engineers.
* Operational and Process Optimization: Adapted team workflows to align with evolving business priorities—transitioning from high-skilled Kanban teams for greenfield projects to balanced SCRUM teams for routine work. This flexibility ensured efficiency while meeting strategic objectives.
High-Performance Systems: Led efforts to support 15B requests per week while maintaining a 99.999% SLA and 100% uptime. Developed automation for incident resolution, debugging, and diagnostics, improving time-to-detect and time-to-resolve while reducing on-call burden for engineers.
* Cost Savings and Innovation: Implemented systems inspired by dampening physics to save $10M+ per year in budget overages. Led a project that re-architected an edge network to resolve latency issues while creating the foundation for new revenue streams. Delivered results consistently ahead of schedule, including MVP launches and new network architectures.
* Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): Built and led diverse teams, including underrepresented groups, and volunteered for ERGs supporting DEI initiatives. Mentored for HackBright Academy to help increase the representation of women in tech.
* Customer and Stakeholder Focus: Managed multi-million-dollar incident responses, leading efforts from live management to customer communications and root-cause analysis. Balanced technical leadership and customer advocacy to ensure timely resolutions and foster trust.</p></div></td></tr>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ReagentX/imessage-exporter"><code>imessage-exporter</code></a>’s goal is to provide the most comprehensive representation of iMessage data available. Message data is stored in a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsarchiver">legacy</a> format that appears to be a stream that represents objects.</p>

<p>Originally, <code>imessage-exporter</code> used a <a href="https://github.com/ReagentX/imessage-exporter/blob/8ccf7321ab3a432fa6acea613571d359e0b284e4/imessage-database/src/util/streamtyped.rs#L11-L71">naive algorithm</a> to extract text data from this blob and inferred other context from the surrounding table data. However, as Apple introduced new iMessage features<sup><a href="#fn1-12689" id="fnr1-12689" title="see footnote">1</a></sup>, additional information was stored only in this blob.</p>

<p>Since <code>typedstream</code> contains critical message content, <code>imessage-exporter</code> must understand the format in a platform-agnostic way. This post explores the reverse engineering process, revealing the structure and logic behind this proprietary binary serialization protocol.</p>

<h2 id="identifying-the-message-storage-format">Identifying the Message Storage Format</h2>

<p>In the iMessage database, message body data is stored in a <code>BLOB</code> column called <code>attributedBody</code> that appears to describe an instance of a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsmutableattributedstring"><code>NSMutableAttributedString</code></a>.</p>

<p>If we save a blob into a file called <code>sample</code> and inspect it with the <code>file</code> program, it emits:</p>

<pre><code>❯ file sample
sample: NeXT/Apple typedstream data, little endian, version 4, system 1000
</code></pre>

<p>The system recognizes this blob, so let’s examine its contents.</p>

<h2 id="typedstream-origins"><code>typedstream</code> Origins</h2>

<p>The <code>typedstream</code> format is a binary serialization protocol designed for <code>C</code> and <code>Objective-C</code> data structures. It is primarily used by Apple’s <code>Foundation</code> framework, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Archiving/Articles/archives.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000946-BAJDBJAI">specifically</a> within their internal implementation of <code>NSArchiver</code> and <code>NSUnarchiver</code>. While those classes are the public APIs, <code>typedstream</code> is the underlying implementation detail.</p>

<p>The format itself is not part of the official <code>Foundation</code> specification, meaning other implementations use <a href="https://github.com/gnustep/libs-base/blob/master/Source/NSArchiver.m">different approaches</a>. This also means Apple’s <code>typedstream</code> remains largely undocumented: it was never intended to be a cross-platform standard, rather it is Apple’s internal solution for object serialization. In fact, archived documentation makes <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Archiving/Archiving.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000047-SW1">no reference</a> to the <code>typedstream</code> format or its implementation.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-format">Understanding the Format</h2>

<p>An example of a simple iMessage <code>attributedBody</code> looks like:</p>

<p>After extracting several samples, we can start to infer some patterns from this data.</p>



<p>The first 16 bytes are always identical and appear to be some sort of header describing the data structure:</p>
<pre>00000000&nbsp;&nbsp;<pk>04</pk> <yl>0b</yl> <gr>73 74 72 65 61 6d&nbsp;&nbsp;74 79 70 65 64</gr> 81 <yl>e8 03</yl>&nbsp;&nbsp;|<pk>.</pk><yl>.</yl><gr>streamtyped</gr>.<yl>..</yl>|
</pre>

<p>Breaking this down, we see 2 bytes <code>04 0b</code>, 11 bytes representing the text <code>streamtyped</code>, and 3 bytes <code>81 e8 03</code>. Interestingly, <code>0x0b</code> is 11, which suggests that it describes the length of the data that follows it, leaving us with two unknowns to investigate: the first <code>0x04</code>, and the final <code>81 e8 03</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s re-examine the output of the <code>file</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>NeXT/Apple typedstream data, little endian, version 4, system 1000
</code></pre>

<p>The first header byte, <code>0x04</code>, matches the version emitted by <code>file</code>, and the last two bytes <code>e8 03</code> form <code>1000</code> as <code>u16</code>, leaving <code>0x81</code> to solve for<sup><a href="#fn2-12689" id="fnr2-12689" title="see footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="visible-patterns">Visible Patterns</h2>

<p>Each legible text segment in the <code>typedstream</code> is preceded by a byte sequence like <code>84 xx</code>, where <code>xx</code> varies depending on the data. Strings sometimes end in <code>0x00</code>, suggesting null-termination<sup><a href="#fn3-12689" id="fnr3-12689" title="see footnote">3</a></sup>. For example:</p>
<pre>00000010&nbsp;&nbsp;<s>84 01 40 84 84</s> <pk>84</pk> <yl>19</yl> <gr>4e&nbsp;&nbsp;53 4d 75 74 61 62 6c 65</gr>&nbsp;&nbsp;|<s>..@..</s><pk>.</pk><yl>.</yl><gr>NSMutable</gr>|
00000020&nbsp;&nbsp;<gr>41 74 74 72 69 62 75 74&nbsp;&nbsp;65 64 53 74 72 69 6e 67</gr>&nbsp;&nbsp;|<gr>AttributedString</gr>|
00000030&nbsp;&nbsp;00 <s>84</s> <pk>84</pk> <yl>12</yl> <gr>4e 53 41 74&nbsp;&nbsp;74 72 69 62 75 74 65 64</gr>&nbsp;&nbsp;|.<s>.</s><pk>.</pk><yl>.</yl><gr>NSAttributed</gr>|
00000040&nbsp;&nbsp;<gr>53 74 72 69 6e 67</gr> 00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<gr>String</gr>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
</pre>

<p>Before <code>NSMutableAttributedString</code>, we see <code>84 19</code>, where <code>0x19</code> is 25, the length of the string. Similarly, <code>NSAttributedString</code> is prepended by <code>84 12</code>, where again <code>0x12</code> matches the length of the data. </p>

<p>This pattern suggests that <code>0x84</code> signals the beginning of a new data block, and the subsequent byte represents how much data that block contains. Given these are class names, it appears to be some metadata block describing classes, but not the data that the classes contain.</p>

<h3 id="embedded-data">Embedded Data</h3>

<p>Objects contain more than just class names; they also have fields that contain data owned by the object. The first class name we encounter–<code>NSMutableAttributedString</code>–is documented by Apple, and includes a field that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsmutableattributedstring/1416955-mutablestring">contains</a> the string data.</p>

<p>Following the pattern we saw above, let’s find the first <code>0x84</code> before the message’s text:</p>

<pre><code>00000070                    84 01  2b 0a 4e 6f 74 65 72 20  |      ..+.Noter |
00000080  74 65 73 74 86                                    |test.           |
</code></pre>

<p><code>0x84</code> denotes some type of new data, but the next byte <code>0x01</code> suggests we only need to read one more byte of data: <code>0x2b</code>, which happens to be the char <code>+</code>. However, the subsequent byte <code>0a</code> matches the length of the message text: <code>"Noter test "</code><sup><a href="#fn4-12689" id="fnr4-12689" title="see footnote">4</a></sup>. The final byte, <code>0x86</code>, is also repeated at the very end of the stream, suggesting it may indicate the end of some data.</p>

<h3 id="another-pattern-emerges">Another Pattern Emerges</h3>

<p>Continuing from our prior assumptions, we see this short blob:</p>

<pre><code>00000080                 84 02 69  49 01 0A                 |     ..iI..     |
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>84 02</code> suggests we need to read two bytes, <code>0x69</code> and <code>0x49</code>, which happen to be <code>i</code> and <code>I</code>. Twice now the stream has a pattern where <code>0x84</code> seems to denote some data type, so let’s take a look at the <code>NSMutableAttributedString</code> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsmutableattributedstring">documentation</a> and see if there are any clues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The primitive <code>setAttributes(_:range:)</code> method sets attributes and values for a given range of characters, replacing any previous attributes and values for that range.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsmutableattributedstring#1653959">changing attributes</a> section, many of the methods receive a parameter like <code>range: NSRange</code>. Per the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsrange">documentation</a>, <code>NSRange</code> encodes a <code>location</code> integer and a <code>length</code> integer.</p>

<p>The <code>i</code> in integer stands out now, because the new data <code>iI</code> in the stream seems to indicate that we are meant to read a pair of integers. The bytes <code>01 0A</code> follow, where <code>0A</code> matches the message length and <code>01</code> appears to represent the starting character index, suggesting this sequence defines an <code>NSRange</code> spanning the complete message.</p>

<p>The fields for these range objects aren't documented, indicating they're likely private class members. The <code>typedstream</code> format’s deterministic packing ensures <code>NSRange</code>s consistently store their <code>location</code> and <code>length</code> values in sequence, probably as different integer types.</p>

<h3 id="solving-the-mystery">Solving the <code>+</code> Mystery</h3>

<p>Let’s translate the stream of bytes into plain language given our current assumptions:</p>
<pre>00000080&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <pk>84</pk> <yl>02</yl> <gr>69&nbsp;&nbsp;49</gr> <bl>01 0A</bl>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <pk>.</pk><yl>.</yl><gr>iI</gr><bl>..</bl>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
</pre>

<p>We can read this as “a new data type of two bytes, <code>iI</code>, followed by the packed field data of <code>1</code> and <code>10</code>”. The data appears to be stored as <code>u8</code> since it is only one byte, but that leaves an open question as to how the stream can store larger values<sup><a href="#fn5-12689" id="fnr5-12689" title="see footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Ignoring that caveat for now, let’s apply that logic to the message text field:</p>
<pre>00000070&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<pk>84</pk> <yl>01</yl>&nbsp;&nbsp;<gr>2b</gr> <yl>0a</yl> <gr>4e 6f 74 65 72 20</gr>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<pk>.</pk><yl>.</yl><gr>+</gr><yl>.</yl><gr>Noter </gr>|
00000080&nbsp;&nbsp;<gr>74 65 73 74</gr> 86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<gr>test</gr>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
</pre>

<p>We can read this as “new data type of 1 byte, <code>+</code>, followed by the field data for a string of <code>0x0a</code> length.”</p>

<p>There is one other instance of this pattern early on, right before the class names appear:</p>
<pre>00000010&nbsp;&nbsp;<pk>84</pk> <yl>01</yl> <gr>40</gr> <s>84 84 84 19 4e&nbsp;&nbsp;53 4d 75 74 61 62 6c 65</s>&nbsp;&nbsp;|<pk>.</pk><yl>.</yl><gr>@</gr><s>....NSMutable</s>|
</pre>

<p>Since the data following this initial <code>0x84</code> appears to describe the class names, the 1 byte <code>0x40</code> (<code>@</code>) may indicate the start of a new object instance.</p>

<h2 id="assumptions-so-far">Assumptions so Far</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>0x84</code> indicates the start of some data blob</li>
<li><code>0x86</code> indicates the end of some data blob</li>
<li><code>0x81</code> indicates something that we don’t know yet</li>
<li>The byte following <code>0x84</code> denotes the length of the data blob</li>
<li>Sometimes, there are bytes that describe packed field data:

<ul>
<li><code>i</code> and <code>I</code> seem to indicate an integer value <code>u8</code></li>
<li><code>+</code> seems to indicate a string</li>
<li><code>@</code> seems to indicate a new object instance</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Class names are null-terminated</li>
<li>Class field data is packed in order at the end of the definition</li>
</ul>

<p>Given these assumptions, let us mark the bytes in the stream for which we can make a reasonable guess at their meaning:</p>

<p>That’s a lot! Let’s focus in on these unknown sections.</p>

<h2 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h2>

<p>There are several places where multiple <code>0x84</code>s bytes appear together, possibly indicating a nested structure. Let’s isolate the first major block that appears to define the <code>NSMutableAttributedString</code>:</p>

<pre><code>00000010  84 01 40 84 84 84 19 4e  53 4d 75 74 61 62 6c 65  |<a href="https://chrissardegna.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="2e00006e00000000607d635b5a4f4c424b">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>|

</code></pre>

<p>Operating under the assumption that the first 3 bytes tell us we are looking at a new object instance, we see 3 <code>0x84</code>s proceeding 3 strings that look like class names: <code>NSMutableAttributedString</code>, <code>NSAttributedString</code>, and <code>NSObject</code>. Continuing further, we see 3 more <code>0x84</code>s followed by 2 more class names, <code>NSMutableString</code> and <code>NSString</code>, and the interior string data.</p>

<p>These two blocks are separated by an <code>0x85</code>. Given we assume <code>0x84</code> is a start byte and <code>0x86</code> is an end byte, it is likely that <code>0x85</code> has some special meaning. Checking the <code>NSMutableAttributedString</code> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsmutableattributedstring">docs</a> again, we see that <code>NSMutableAttributedString</code> inherits from <code>NSAttributedString</code>, and its only field contains a <code>NSMutableString</code>, which <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsmutablestring">inherits</a> from <code>NSString</code>.</p>

<p>We can infer that <code>0x85</code> serves as an end token, perhaps a terminator or something similar, as it seems to separate the class hierarchy from its field data. Let's add some color to denote the possible nested ranges of this block:</p>

<h3 id="assembling-nested-data">Assembling Nested Data</h3>

<p>This leaves us with a few bits of missing data. Class names end with a single byte, here <code>0x01</code> or <code>0x00</code>. Previously, the assumption was that names were null terminated, but perhaps this is class data or some type of version number. Immediately after the <code>0x85</code>, there is a <code>0x92</code> that we are ignoring for now. Further, there is a <code>0x95</code> that seems to take the place of what should be a third part to the second class hierarchy:</p>

<pre><code>└── NSMutableAttributedString (v0)
    ├── Superclass Chain
    │   └── NSAttributedString (v0)
    │       └── NSObject (v0)
    │           └── 0x85
    │
    └── Fields
        └── NSMutableString (v1)
            ├── Superclass Chain
            │   └── NSString (v1)
            │       └── 0x95
            │
            └── Fields
                └── "Noter test "
</code></pre>

<p>We know that <code>NSString</code> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsstring?language=objc">extends</a> <code>NSObject</code>, so even though no bytes explicitly indicate this relationship, it must be represented somehow. But how can we confirm that?</p>

<h2 id="stumbling-across-the-type-cache">Stumbling Across the Type Cache</h2>

<p>The <code>0x92</code> and <code>0x95</code> must mean something. They are only 3 values apart, and they appear in places where we would expect something else to occur: The first time we saw <code>84 84 84</code>, it was prepended by <code>84 01 40</code> (<code>@</code>), which we are assuming represents the start of a new object instance. However, the second time we saw that same pattern, it was prepended by <code>0x92</code>. We also know that <code>NSString</code> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsstring">inherits</a> from <code>NSObject</code>, but instead the stream contains <code>0x95</code>.</p>

<p>There has to be a pattern here, so let’s look at the data every time we see a new <code>0x84</code> in the stream to see if we can discern anything. Beginning after the header and ending before the known encoded message content, we have the following:</p>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>

<thead>
<tr>
	<th>Index</th>
	<th>Item</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td>1</td>
	<td><code>@</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>2</td>
	<td><code>NSMutableAttributedString</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>3</td>
	<td><code>NSAttributedString</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>4</td>
	<td><code>NSObject</code></td>

<tr>
	<td>5</td>
	<td><code>NSMutableString</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>6</td>
	<td><code>NSString</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="assembling-the-cache">Assembling the Cache</h3>

<p>Our intuition tells us that where we see <code>0x92</code>, we should be <code>84 01 40</code> (the start of a a new object), and where we see <code>0x95</code>, we should see the <code>NSObject</code> bytes. Just as <code>0x92</code> and <code>0x95</code> are 3 values apart, so are <code>@</code> and <code>NSObject</code> in the order of streamed data. Could these bytes represent an index?</p>

<p>If we assume that <code>0x92</code> is the first index, we get the following:</p>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>

<thead>
<tr>
	<th>Index</th>
	<th>Predicted Offset</th>
	<th>Item</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td>1</td>
	<td><code>0x92</code></td>
	<td><code>@</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>2</td>
	<td><code>0x93</code></td>
	<td><code>NSMutableAttributedString</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>3</td>
	<td><code>0x94</code></td>
	<td><code>NSAttributedString</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>4</td>
	<td><code>0x95</code></td>
	<td><code>NSObject</code></td>

<tr>
	<td>5</td>
	<td><code>0x96</code></td>
	<td><code>NSMutableString</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>6</td>
	<td><code>0x97</code></td>
	<td><code>NSString</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The indexes <code>0x92</code> and <code>0x95</code> appear to point to our missing data! Let’s reassemble our object with this in mind:</p>

<pre><code>└── NSMutableAttributedString (v0)
    ├── Superclass Chain
    │   └── NSAttributedString (v0)
    │       └── NSObject (v0)
    │           └── 0x85
    │
    └── Fields
        └── NSMutableString (v1)
            ├── Superclass Chain
            │   └── NSString (v1)
            │       └── NSObject (v0)
            │           └── 0x85
            │
            └── Fields
                └── "Noter test "
</code></pre>

<p>This indicates that <code>0x92</code> and larger values indicate the index in a cache of previously-seen data.</p>

<h2 id="updating-our-assumptions">Updating our Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>0x84</code> indicates the start of a data blob

<ul>
<li>The byte following <code>0x84</code> denotes the length of the data blob</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>0x85</code> indicates the end of a class inheritance chain</li>
<li><code>0x86</code> indicates the end of a data blob</li>
<li><code>0x81</code> indicates something that we don’t know yet, but seems to be related to integers</li>
<li>In order of appearance, new blobs are stored in a cache

<ul>
<li>The first index is <code>0x92</code>, and references are stored in the stream directly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sometimes, there are bytes that describe packed field data:

<ul>
<li><code>i</code> and <code>I</code> seem to indicate an integer value <code>u8</code></li>
<li><code>+</code> seems to indicate a string</li>
<li><code>@</code> seems to indicate a new object instance</li>
<li><code>*</code> seems to indicate some unknown data type</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Class names are followed by some <code>u8</code> version information</li>
<li>Class field data is packed in order at the end of the definition</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from the header, these assumptions account for all remaining bytes in the stream. Let’s follow the logic, placing references where we expect them:</p>

<p>This gets us a little further, but there are two curiosities that violate this pattern. In two places, we see <code>0x84</code> followed by two references, not just one: at <code>0xa4</code> we see <code>84 98 98</code>, and at <code>0xe3</code> we see <code>84 9b 9b</code>. Putting those aside, let’s try and assemble what we can from the stream<sup><a href="#fn6-12689" id="fnr6-12689" title="see footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="defining-terms">Defining Terms</h3>

<p>Leveraging our assumptions, we can define a few concepts:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Type Tags</strong>: Bytes like <code>+</code>, <code>@</code>, and the like seem to define primitive types like integers and strings. Since these define data that is packed together, let’s think of them as a group like <code>Vec&lt;Type&gt;</code>.

<ul>
<li>For example, the earlier <code>iI</code> would be a type tag like <code>[Int, Int]</code>.</li>
<li>We can reference these type tags by index in order of appearance, so we can enclose that type tag as a larger vector like <code>Vec&lt;Vec&lt;Type&gt;&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Indicators</strong>: Bytes like <code>0x81</code> and <code>0x84..0x86</code> seem to have specific meanings, indicating that we are meant to read the subsequent data in a specific way.</li>
<li><strong>Archivable Objects</strong>: As we read the stream, we find class inheritance hierarchies that pertain to specific object instances</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="testing-the-theory">Testing the Theory</h3>

<p>In order to validate that our logic works, let’s apply it to the initial sample stream up to <code>0xa4</code>, where our assumptions are violated. In order of appearance, the type tags thus far are:</p>

<h2 id="discovering-a-second-cache">Discovering a Second Cache</h2>

<p>One thing that stands out later in the stream are these bytes:</p>

</pre>

<p>Given our assumptions, we can read the first half of this slice:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>0x92</code> refers to <code>@</code> in the type tags table, indicating a new object</li>
<li><code>0x84</code> indicates we want to start a new blob of data</li>
</ul>

<p>The remaining two <code>0x98</code> are pointers, but to what? In the type tag table, <code>0x98</code> points to <code>+</code>, but it wouldn’t make sense to have two type tags referenced together, as a type tag can already have multiple types within it<sup><a href="#fn7-12689" id="fnr7-12689" title="see footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-archivable-object-cache">Building the Archivable Object Cache</h3>

<p>So far, we have some readable object instances and some class hierarchies defined in inheritance order. One thing that stands out is that <code>0x98</code>, what we previously thought was a type tag reference, also aligns with an entry in the archivable objects table. If we instead number the output starting at <code>0x92</code>, we get:</p>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>

<thead>
<tr>
	<th>Index</th>
	<th>Predicted Data</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td><code>0x92</code></td>
	<td>Top-level object container</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>0x93</code></td>
	<td><code>Class { name: "NSMutableAttributedString", version: 0, ... }</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>0x94</code></td>
	<td><code>Class { name: "NSAttributedString", version: 0, ... }</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>0x95</code></td>
	<td><code>Class { name: "NSObject", version: 0}</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>0x96</code></td>
	<td><code>Object(Class { name: "NSMutableString", version: 1 }, [String("Noter test")])</code></td>

<tr>
	<td><code>0x97</code></td>
	<td><code>Class { name: "NSMutableString", version: 1, ... }</code></td>

	<td><code>0x98</code></td>
	<td><code>Class { name: "NSString", version: 1, ... }</code></td>

	<td><code>0x99</code></td>

</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>0x9a</code></td>
	<td><code>Class { name: "NSDictionary", version: 0, ... }</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>This makes a lot more sense: the first <code>0x98</code> isn’t referencing the type tag <code>[+]</code>, rather it is referencing the <code>NSString</code> class at <code>0x98</code>. The subsequent <code>0x98</code>, then, denotes the data associated with that class instance. Further, our <code>0x95</code> from earlier is not simply referencing the string <code>"NSObject"</code>, rather it is referencing the specific <code>NSObject</code> class that contains <code>0x85</code> as its parent.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-archivable-object-cache">Using the Archivable Object Cache</h3>

<p>With this new assumption, we can now read the rest of the data in the slice:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>0x92</code> refers to <code>@</code> in the type tags table, indicating a new object</li>
<li><code>0x84</code> indicates we want to start a new blob of data</li>
<li><code>0x98</code> refers to the <code>NSString</code> class</li>
<li><code>0x98</code> refers to <code>+</code>, indicating we should read the next data as a string</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, we can read this slice as “new <code>NSString</code> object, whose field data is encoded as <code>+</code>.”</p>

<p>This logic also follows the pattern we see with string length bytes. Just as with the text after the first <code>+</code>, the bytes after the referenced <code>+</code> start with a byte that tells us the length of the string (here, <code>0x1d</code>, or <code>29</code>):</p>

<h3 id="translating-the-stream">Translating the Stream</h3>

<p>The three <code>0x92</code> bytes indicate that there should be three objects stored here. Given the provided class names, we can intuit that this slice probably stores a dictionary that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "__kIMMessagePartAttributeName": NSNumber(?)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s try and translate the stream manually.</p>

<h4 id="object-1">Object 1</h4>

<p>Here is the first new object definition: </p>
<pre>00000080&nbsp;&nbsp;<s>74 65 73 74 86 84 02 69&nbsp;&nbsp;49 01 0a</s> 92 <pk>84 84 84</pk> <yl>0c</yl>&nbsp;&nbsp;|<s>test...iI...</s><pk>...</pk><yl>.</yl>|
00000090&nbsp;&nbsp;<gr>4e 53 44 69 63 74 69 6f&nbsp;&nbsp;6e 61 72 79</gr> 00 95 <pk>84</pk> <yl>01</yl>&nbsp;&nbsp;|<gr>NSDictionary</gr><pk>.</pk>.<pk>.</pk><yl>.</yl>|

</pre>

<p>And here is how our assumptions apply to that slice:</p>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>

<thead>
<tr>
	<th>Byte(s)</th>
	<th>Component</th>
	<th>Description</th>
</tr>

	<td><code>0x84</code></td>
	<td>Blob Indicator</td>

	<td><code>0x01</code></td>
	<td>Dictionary Size</td>
	<td>Indicates a single key/value pair</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The final <code>0x01</code> may represent something else, but given we can look at the stream and see only a single key/value pair, for now let’s assume it represents the length field. Let’s visualize what we have so far:</p>

<pre><code>└── NSDictionary (v0)
    ├── Superclass Chain
    │   └── NSObject (v0)
    │       └── 0x85
    │
    └── Fields
        └── 0x01
</code></pre>

<h4 id="object-2">Object 2</h4>

<p>This is the <code>NSString</code> we parsed earlier:</p>

<pre><code>└── NSString (v1)
    ├── Superclass Chain
    │   └── NSObject (v0)
    │       └── 0x85
    │
    └── Fields
        └── String("__kIMMessagePartAttributeName")
</code></pre>

<p>Given its location in the stream and its prefix of <code>__k</code>, let’s assume this is the first key in the dictionary and add it to the overall object:</p>

<pre><code>└── NSDictionary (v0)
    ├── Superclass Chain
    │   └── NSObject (v0)
    │       └── 0x85
    │
    └── Fields
        ├── 0x01
        └── NSString (v1)
            ├── Superclass Chain
            │   └── NSObject (v0)
            │       └── 0x85
            │
            └── Fields:
                └── String("__kIMMessagePartAttributeName")
</code></pre>

<h4 id="object-3">Object 3</h4>

<p>Finally, let’s isolate the last slice of bytes we need to translate:</p>
<pre>000000c0&nbsp;&nbsp;<s>4e 61 6d 65 86</s> 92 <s>84 84</s>&nbsp;&nbsp;<pk>84</pk> <yl>08</yl> <gr>4e 53 4e 75 6d 62</gr>&nbsp;&nbsp;|<s>Name....</s><pk>.</pk><yl>.</yl><gr>NSNumb</gr>|
000000d0&nbsp;&nbsp;<gr>65 72</gr> 00 <s>84</s> <pk>84</pk> <yl>07</yl> <gr>4e 53&nbsp;&nbsp;56 61 6c 75 65</gr> 00 95 <pk>84</pk>&nbsp;&nbsp;|<gr>er</gr>.<s>.</s><pk>.</pk><yl>.</yl><gr>NSValue</gr>..<pk>.</pk>|
000000e0&nbsp;&nbsp;<yl>01</yl> <gr>2a</gr> <u>84 9b 9b 00</u> 86 <s>86&nbsp;&nbsp;86</s>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<yl>.</yl><gr>*</gr><u>....</u>.<s>..</s>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
</pre>

<p>Most of this we have already seen: until address <code>0xdf</code>, the stream encodes the inheritance hierarchy for <code>NSNumber</code>:</p>

<pre><code>└── NSNumber (v0)
    ├── Superclass Chain
    │   └── NSValue (v0)
    │       └── NSObject (v0)
    │           └── 0x85
    │
    └── Fields
        └── ?
</code></pre>

<p>However, where we expect the field data, we see a byte pattern indicating a new type tag <code>*</code>. Checking the <code>NSNumber</code> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsnumber?language=objc#1776615">documentation</a>, we can start to chase these type tags down. The docs make an offhand mention of these tags:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Your implementation of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsvalue/1412365-objctype?language=objc"><code>objCType</code></a> must return one of “c”, “C”, “s”, “S”, “i”, “I”, “l”, “L”, “q”, “Q”, “f”, and “d”. This is required for the other methods of <code>NSNumber</code> to behave correctly.</li>
<li>Your subclass must override the accessor method that corresponds to the declared type—for example, if your implementation of <code>objCType</code> returns “i”, you must override <code>intValue</code>.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>This confirms our prior hypothesis that <code>i</code> (and probably <code>I</code>) tell the stream that the following data is an integer! However, the documentation for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsvalue/1412365-objctype?language=objc"><code>objCType</code></a> doesn’t have much information about what these characters mean. <a href="https://kagi.com/search?q=site%3Aapple.com++%22%40encode%22&amp;r=us&amp;sh=niRuA-WBujycClDVm26K8g">Searching</a> for <code>site:apple.com  "@encode"</code>, we find <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Archiving/Articles/codingobjects.html">this</a> archived documentation pointing to a book called <em>The Objective-C Programming Language</em>.</p>

<p>In that book, we land upon a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCRuntimeGuide/Articles/ocrtTypeEncodings.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008048-CH100-SW1">table</a> of enumerated type encodings. That table confirms that <code>i</code> and <code>I</code> do represent integers, signed and unsigned, respectively. It also tells us that this mystery <code>*</code> refers to “A character string <code>(char *)</code>”.</p>

<p>So far, we know that <code>NSNumber</code> extends <code>NSValue</code>, specifically dealing with numeric variants. We also know that <code>NSValue</code> uses <code>objCType</code> to represent the type it encapsulates internally. The <code>objCType</code> documentation states that it is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A <code>C</code> string containing the <code>Objective-C</code> type of the data contained in the value object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, it seems like the data that follows <code>*</code> should be read as a type tag describing the data that follows. Let’s isolate just that block:</p>
<pre>000000d0&nbsp;&nbsp;<s>65 72 00 84 84 07 4e 53&nbsp;&nbsp;56 61 6c 75 65 00 95</s> <pk>84</pk>&nbsp;&nbsp;|<s>er....NSValue..</s><pk>.</pk>|
000000e0&nbsp;&nbsp;<yl>01</yl> <gr>2a</gr> <pk>84</pk> <bl>9b 9b</bl> 00 86 <s>86&nbsp;&nbsp;86</s>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<yl>.</yl><gr>*</gr><bl>..</bl>...<s>..</s>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|
</pre>

<p>Translating this following our assumptions, we get the following result:</p>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>

<thead>
<tr>
	<th>Byte(s)</th>
	<th>Component</th>
	<th>Description</th>

<tbody>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>This sequence represents an <code>NSNumber</code> object containing an integer value. Like other object instances in the stream, the object’s data follows its class definition. Here, the first <code>0x9b</code> represents the <code>objCType</code> of the <code>NSValue</code> instance. Because it is larger than <code>0x92</code>, we look it up in the type tags table. This means our <code>NSValue</code> represents the <code>objCType</code> of <code>i</code>, or a signed integer.</p>

<p>The second <code>0x9b</code> references a type tag in the type tags table, indicating that the next byte (<code>0x00</code>) should be read as a signed integer. Both of these values refer to the same type tag, <code>i</code>, but they use that type tag in different ways: the first one tells us what type of data the <code>NSValue</code> instance owns, and the second tells us how to read the next byte from the stream.</p>

<p>The object structure can be represented as:</p>

<pre><code>└── NSNumber (v0)
    ├── Superclass Chain
    │   └── NSValue (v0)
    │       └── NSObject (v0)
    │           └── 0x85
    │
    └── Fields
        └── SignedInteger(0x00)
</code></pre>

<h4 id="the-whole-dictionary">The Whole Dictionary</h4>

<p>Combining all of what we have translated, the resultant dictionary looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>└── NSDictionary (v0)
    ├── Superclass Chain
    │   └── NSObject (v0)
    │       └── 0x85

        ├── SignedInteger(0x01)
        ├── NSString (v1)
        │   ├── Superclass Chain

        │   │       └── 0x85
        │   │
        │   └── Fields:
        │       └── "__kIMMessagePartAttributeName"
        └── NSNumber (v0)
            ├── Superclass Chain
            │   └── NSValue (v0)
            │       └── NSObject (v0)
            │           └── 0x85
            │
            └── Fields
                └── SignedInteger(0x00)
</code></pre>

<p>This confirms that the stream encodes a dictionary with a single key-value pair, as expected.</p>

<h2 id="format-specification-summary">Format Specification Summary</h2>

<p>Through systematic analysis and validation of our assumptions against the data samples, we can now attempt to describe the <code>typedstream</code> specification’s core structure and behavior.</p>

<h3 id="updating-assumptions-again">Updating Assumptions Again</h3>

<p>First, let’s update our assumptions based on what we have learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Type Tags

<ul>
<li>Primitive types in the stream are prefixed by a type tag or a reference to a type tag, as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCRuntimeGuide/Articles/ocrtTypeEncodings.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008048-CH100-SW1">defined</a> in the <em>Objective-C Runtime Programming Guide</em></li>
<li>As we find them, distinct type tags are cached in a table and referenced by index</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Indicators

<ul>
<li><code>0x84</code> indicates the start of a data blob

<ul>
<li>The byte following <code>0x84</code> denotes the length of the data blob</li>
<li>If the byte is <code>0x92</code> or larger, it indicates a reference to a type tag stored in the type tags table</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>0x85</code> indicates the end of a class inheritance chain</li>
<li><code>0x86</code> indicates the end of a data blob</li>
<li><code>0x81</code> indicates something related to integers</li>
<li>There are probably more indicators, likely in the range <code>0x81..0x86</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Archivable Objects

<ul>
<li>In order of inheritance, new objects and classes are stored in a cache of archivable objects

<ul>
<li>Similar to type tags, the first index is <code>0x92</code>, and references are stored in the stream directly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Class names are followed by some <code>u8</code> version information</li>
<li>Class field data is packed in order at the end of the definition</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="discovering-more-indicators">Discovering more Indicators</h4>

<p>By collecting a large amount of <code>attributedBody</code> data, we can search for specific bytes. Since we predicted that indicators lie in the range <code>0x81..0x86</code>, let’s search for the missing bytes to see what we find.</p>

<h5 id="indicator-0x81">Indicator <code>0x81</code></h5>

<p>Aside from the header, this byte showed up in several very long iMessages<sup><a href="#fn8-12689" id="fnr8-12689" title="see footnote">8</a></sup>:</p>
<pre>00000070&nbsp;&nbsp;<s>72 69 6e 67 01 95 84 01&nbsp;&nbsp;2b</s> 81 <bl>37 09</bl> <s>53 65 64 20</s>&nbsp;&nbsp;|<s>ring....+</s>.<bl>7.</bl><s>Sed</s> |
</pre>

<p>This sample contained a message with <code>2359</code> characters. The bytes following <code>0x81</code> are <code>0x37 0x09</code>, which represent that value as a 16-bit integer. This also matches our header, which we know ends with the bytes for <code>1000</code>, confirming that <code>0x81</code> indicates a 16-bit integer follows.</p>
<pre>00000000&nbsp;&nbsp;<s>04 0b 73 74 72 65 61 6d&nbsp;&nbsp;74 79 70 65 64</s> 81 <bl>e8 03</bl>&nbsp;&nbsp;|<s>..streamtyped</s>.<bl>..</bl>|
</pre>

<h5 id="inferring-other-indicators">Inferring Other Indicators</h5>

<p><code>0x82</code> and <code>0x83</code> were not in any samples, but continuing from the pattern, we can infer that since <code>0x81</code> represents a 2-byte (<code>u16</code>/<code>i16</code>) integer, <code>0x82</code> and <code>0x83</code> also refer to different width numbers. Going back to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCRuntimeGuide/Articles/ocrtTypeEncodings.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008048-CH100-SW1">table</a> defined in the <em>Objective-C Runtime Programming Guide</em>, we can use the type tags to infer the meaning of these indicators:</p>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>

<thead>
<tr>
	<th>Type Tag</th>
	<th>Meaning</th>
	<th>Inferred Indicator Byte</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td><code>i</code></td>
	<td>An <code>int</code></td>
	<td>None</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>s</code></td>
	<td>A <code>short</code></td>
	<td><code>0x81</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>l</code></td>
	<td>A <code>long``l</code> is treated as a 32-bit quantity on 64-bit programs.</td>
	<td><code>0x82</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>q</code></td>
	<td>A <code>long long</code></td>
	<td><code>0x83</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The type tag determines whether the integer is signed or unsigned, while the presence and value of the indicator byte determines the integer’s width in the stream. We can use this to predict the byte representation we might see:</p>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>

<thead>
<tr>
	<th>Byte Sequence</th>
	<th>Inferred Meaning</th>
	<th>Expected Result</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td><code>0x69 0x00</code></td>
	<td>Integer, single byte width</td>
	<td><code>0</code> as <code>i8</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>0x69 0x81 0x37 0x09</code></td>
	<td>Integer, two-byte width</td>
	<td><code>2359</code> as <code>i16</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>0x49 0x81 0x37 0x09</code></td>
	<td>Unsigned Integer, two-byte width</td>
	<td><code>2359</code> as <code>u16</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>0x49 0x81 0xe8 0x03</code></td>
	<td>Unsigned Integer, two-byte width</td>
	<td><code>1000</code> as <code>u16</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>In order to confirm this, we would need more sample data that included values of these sizes.</p>

<h3 id="defining-format-rules">Defining Format Rules</h3>

<p>Given this information, we can write a simple set of steps as a baseline for reading this format:</p>

<ol>
<li>Validate the header</li>
<li><code>0x84</code> indicates we are creating a new piece of archivable data

<ul>
<li>If the subsequent byte is <code>0x92</code> or greater, we have a reference to a previously-seen object or class</li>
<li>If the subsequent byte less than <code>0x92</code>, it describes the length of the object or class data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Objects are stored in the following order:

<ul>
<li>The class hierarchy, including inheritance</li>
<li>The field data owned by the class</li>
<li>Field names are not stored, but their data is always stored in the same order</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As we encounter new objects, add them to a table of archivable objects</li>
<li>As we encounter new type tags, add them to a table of type tags</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="using-decoded-typedstream-data">Using Decoded <code>typedstream</code> Data</h2>

<p>Now that we understand how to read a <code>typedstream</code>, we need to think about how to use and represent it in <code>imessage-exporter</code>.</p>

<p>Since the stream encodes <code>Objective-C</code> data structures, specifically instances of classes and the data they own, we can use these rules to yield objects out of the stream. <code>imessage-exporter</code> does this, then reads the objects as they are yielded to build a message’s <a href="https://docs.rs/imessage-database/latest/imessage_database/tables/messages/models/enum.BubbleComponent.html">components</a>.</p>

<h2 id="data-representations">Data Representations</h2>

<p>Since non-Apple platforms do not natively support <code>Foundation</code> data structures, we must define an alternative representation.</p>

<h3 id="type-tags">Type Tags</h3>

<p>We can define an enum to represent the known type tags. Given the legacy documentation and our own observations, this definition should distill it to a single data structure<sup><a href="#fn9-12689" id="fnr9-12689" title="see footnote">9</a></sup>:</p>

<pre><code>fn from_byte(byte: &amp;u8) -&gt; Self {
    match byte {
        0x40 =&gt; Self::Object,
        0x2B =&gt; Self::Utf8String,
        0x2A =&gt; Self::EmbeddedData,
        0x66 =&gt; Self::Float,
        0x64 =&gt; Self::Double,
        0x63 | 0x69 | 0x6c | 0x71 | 0x73 =&gt; Self::SignedInt,
        0x43 | 0x49 | 0x4c | 0x51 | 0x53 =&gt; Self::UnsignedInt,
        other =&gt; Self::Unknown(*other),
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>0x2B</code>, or <code>+</code>, is not mentioned in the legacy documentation, but we can infer what the type tag represents based on the context in the collected <code>typedstream</code> samples.</p>

<p>This data structure allows us to leverage Rust’s pattern matching to dispatch data as we encounter it in the stream. It also implies we need a separate data structure to represent the data stored after these type tags:</p>

<pre><code>pub enum OutputData {
    String(String),
    SignedInteger(i64),
    UnsignedInteger(u64),
    Float(f32),
    Double(f64),
    Byte(u8),
    Array(Vec&lt;u8&gt;),
    Class(Class),
}
</code></pre>

<p>By combining these structures, we can implement the serialization logic in Rust as follows:</p>

<pre><code>fn extract(data_type: Type) -&gt; OutputData {
    match data_type {
        Type::SignedInt =&gt; OutputData::SignedInteger(read_signed_int()),
        Type::UnsignedInt =&gt; OutputData::UnsignedInteger(read_unsigned_int()),
        Type::Float =&gt; OutputData::Float(read_float()),
        _ =&gt; ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="classes">Classes</h3>

<p>We can define a simple structure that represents the class data stored in the stream<sup><a href="#fn10-12689" id="fnr10-12689" title="see footnote">10</a></sup>:</p>

<pre><code>pub struct Class {
    pub name: String,
    pub version: u64,
}
</code></pre>

<p>The only data stored in the stream is the class name and the class version. We can pattern match against these names to build any arbitrary structures later, if necessary.</p>

<h3 id="archivable-objects">Archivable Objects</h3>

<p>We also need to encapsulate the data to store in the archivable object cache. This can be a class, an object, or an object’s field data<sup><a href="#fn11-12689" id="fnr11-12689" title="see footnote">11</a></sup>.</p>

<pre><code>pub enum Archivable {
    Object(Class, Vec&lt;OutputData&gt;),
    Data(Vec&lt;OutputData&gt;),
    Class(Class),
    Type(Vec&lt;Type&gt;),
}
</code></pre>

<p>An object, for example, contains a specific class, followed by a vector of field data owned by that class’s instance. An example of this looks like:</p>

<pre><code>Archivable::Object(
    Class {
        name: "NSDictionary".to_string(),
        version: 0,
    },
    vec![OutputData::SignedInteger(2)],
)
</code></pre>

<p>Given what we learned about <code>NSDictionary</code>, the <code>OutputData</code> here refers to the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary, indicating the next 4 objects yielded from the stream are alternating key-value pairs belonging to this <code>NSDictionary</code>.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-data">Using the Data</h2>

<p><code>imessage-exporter</code> provides a deserialization <a href="https://docs.rs/imessage-database/latest/imessage_database/util/typedstream/parser/struct.TypedStreamReader.html">struct</a> that yields objects and their data from a <code>typedstream</code>. The rest of the parsing logic is focussed on specifically representing iMessage data, but could be adapted for arbitrary <code>typedstream</code> data.</p>

<p><code>imessage-exporter</code> <a href="https://docs.rs/imessage-database/latest/imessage_database/util/typedstream/models/index.html">documents</a> leverages the foregoing data models to represent attributes of the message body in a data structure called <a href="https://docs.rs/imessage-database/latest/imessage_database/tables/messages/models/enum.BubbleComponent.html"><code>BubbleComponent</code></a><sup><a href="#fn12-12689" id="fnr12-12689" title="see footnote">12</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Reverse engineering of Apple’s <code>typedstream</code> format reveals a sophisticated and elegantly designed binary serialization protocol. Through careful analysis of patterns, documentation fragments, and sample data, we've uncovered a format that efficiently encodes complex object hierarchies.</p>

<p>The resulting implementation in <code>imessage-exporter</code> demonstrates how this legacy format can be deserialized, enabling platform-agnostic access to iMessage data that was previously locked within Apple’s ecosystem. This work not only enables practical applications like message export and analysis but also serves as a case study in reverse engineering binary formats through pattern recognition and hypothesis testing.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">As of Sunday in the European Union, the bloc’s regulators can ban the use of AI systems they deem to pose “unacceptable risk” or harm.</p>

<p>February 2 is the first compliance deadline for the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/16/eu-ai-act-everything-you-need-to-know/">EU’s AI Act</a>, the comprehensive AI regulatory framework that the European Parliament finally approved last March after years of development. The act officially went into force <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/01/the-eus-ai-act-is-now-in-force/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 1</a>; what’s now following is the first of the compliance deadlines.</p>







<p><a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The specifics are set out in Article 5</a>, but broadly, the Act is designed to cover a myriad of use cases where AI might appear and interact with individuals, from consumer applications through to physical environments.</p>

<p>Under the&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_1683" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">bloc’s approach</a>, there are four broad risk levels: (1) Minimal risk (e.g., email spam filters) will face no regulatory oversight; (2) limited risk, which includes customer service chatbots, will have a light-touch regulatory oversight; (3) high risk — AI for healthcare recommendations is one example — will face heavy regulatory oversight; and (4) unacceptable risk applications — the focus of this month’s compliance requirements — will be prohibited entirely. </p>

<p>Some of the unacceptable activities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>AI used for social scoring (e.g., building risk profiles based on a person’s behavior).</li>



<li>AI that manipulates a person’s decisions subliminally or deceptively.</li>



<li>AI that exploits vulnerabilities like age, disability, or socioeconomic status.</li>



<li>AI that attempts to predict people committing crimes based on their appearance.</li>



<li>AI that uses biometrics to infer a person’s characteristics, like their sexual orientation.</li>



<li>AI that collects “real time” biometric data in public places for the purposes of law enforcement.</li>



<li>AI that tries to infer people’s emotions at work or school.</li>



<li>AI that creates — or expands — facial recognition databases by scraping images online or from security cameras.</li>
</ul>

<p>Companies that are found to be using any of the above AI applications in the EU will be subject to fines, regardless of where they are headquartered. They could be on the hook for up to €35 million (~$36 million), or 7% of their annual revenue from the prior fiscal year, whichever is greater.</p>

<p>The fines won’t kick in for some time, noted Rob Sumroy, head of technology at the British law firm Slaughter and May, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>


<p>“Organizations are expected to be fully compliant by February 2, but&nbsp;… the next big deadline that companies need to be aware of is in August,” Sumroy said. “By then, we’ll know who the competent authorities are, and the fines and enforcement provisions will take effect.”</p>

<h2 id="h-preliminary-pledges">Preliminary pledges</h2>

<p>The February 2 deadline is in some ways a formality. </p>

<p>Last September, over 100 companies signed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/early-sign-ups-to-eus-ai-pact-include-amazon-google-microsoft-and-openai-but-apple-and-meta-are-missing/">EU AI Pact</a>, a voluntary pledge&nbsp;to start applying the principles of the&nbsp;AI Act&nbsp;ahead of its entry into application. As part of the Pact, signatories — which included Amazon, Google, and OpenAI — committed to identifying AI systems likely to be categorized as high risk under the AI Act.</p>







<p>Some tech giants, notably Meta and Apple, skipped the Pact. French AI startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/11/paris-based-ai-startup-mistral-ai-raises-640-million/">Mistral</a>, one of the AI Act’s harshest critics, also opted not to sign. </p>

<p>That isn’t to suggest that Apple, Meta, Mistral, or others who didn’t agree to the Pact won’t meet their obligations — including the ban on unacceptably risky systems. Sumroy points out that, given the nature of the prohibited use cases laid out, most companies won’t be engaging in those practices anyway.</p>

<p>“For organizations, a key concern around the EU AI Act is whether clear guidelines, standards, and codes of conduct will arrive in time — and crucially, whether they will provide organizations with clarity on compliance,” Sumroy said. “However, the working groups are, so far, meeting their deadlines on the code of conduct for&nbsp;… developers.”</p>

<h2 id="h-possible-exemptions">Possible exemptions</h2>

<p>There are exceptions to several of the AI Act’s prohibitions.</p>

<p>For example, the Act permits law enforcement to use certain systems that collect biometrics in public places if those systems help perform a “targeted search” for, say, an abduction victim, or to help prevent a “specific, substantial, and imminent” threat to life. This exemption requires authorization from the appropriate governing body, and the Act stresses that law enforcement can’t make a decision that “produces an adverse legal effect” on a person solely based on these systems’ outputs.</p>

<p>The Act also carves out exceptions for systems that infer emotions in workplaces and schools where there’s a “medical or safety” justification, like systems designed for therapeutic use.</p>

<p>The European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-launches-consultation-ai-act-prohibitions-and-ai-system-definition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said that it would release additional guidelines</a> in “early 2025,” following a consultation with stakeholders in November. However, those guidelines have yet to be published.</p>

<p>Sumroy said it’s also unclear how other laws on the books might interact with the AI Act’s prohibitions and related provisions. Clarity may not arrive until later in the year, as the enforcement window approaches.</p>







<p>“It’s important for organizations to remember that AI regulation doesn’t exist in isolation,” Sumroy said. “Other legal frameworks, such as GDPR, NIS2, and DORA, will interact with the AI Act, creating potential challenges — particularly around overlapping incident notification requirements. Understanding how these laws fit together will be just as crucial as understanding the AI Act itself.”</p>

                        Tallis’ London Street Views includes eighty-eight parts, which were followed by eighteen additional enlarged and revised views released several years later. “Each part consisted of the engraved elevation spread over the two centre pages, four surrounding pages of advertisements with an historical and descriptive text occupying the middle columns, and a coloured wrapper carrying the title, further advertisements, and a street directory relating to the elevation … The elevations of both sides of the street were engraved together with a map of its location in relation to surrounding streets and a view, either of the street itself, or of a famous building or individual shop. Where possible each street was dealt with in a single issue, but several of the important longer thoroughfares had to be spread over two or more parts: Oxford Street, for instance, had six parts devoted to it. So although there was a total of eighty-eight parts only seventy-four streets were illustrated. Each issue of the Street Views was sold at 1 1/2 d. a copy, with an occasional exception at 2d. The low cost is explained by the fact that the publication was devised as an advertising medium. Although the lists of names in the street directories were complete, by no means all of the premises in the elevations had their proprietors’ names engraved on them, and it is clear that this privilege had to be paid for. According to Beresford Chancellor (Architectural Review. July, 1924, p. 39), the drawings for the elevations were made by an artist named Charles Bigot … The historical and descriptive notes were probably compiled by William Gaspey who certainly wrote the notes for the 1847 edition … The printers of the covers and text are W. Hill of Northampton Street, Clerkenwell, but it is unlikely that they also printed the engraved plates, for the printing of copper- and steel-engravings was a highly specialized craft bearing no affinity with letterpress printing … There is a reference among Tallis papers to ‘Willoughby our printer,’ which clearly refers to Richard Willoughby &amp; Co. … Although it is impossible to date the beginning and the ending of these Street Views precisely, I suggest the following dating: Parts 1-36, issued 1838; Parts 37-79, 1839; Parts 80-88, 1840. The later edition of Street Views is also undated but from the clues contained in the advertisements it seems that they were issued during the latter half of 1847.” [Jackson, Peter (1969). Introduction. John Tallis’s London street views (p. 9-13). London Topographical Society, Nattali &amp; Maurice, London.] The Rumsey Collection copy includes 77 original street view pamphlets; the online version is augmented by 11 facsimile images of numbers 78 to 88 from the London Topographical Society edition mentioned above.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="paragraph-html-content-1724" data-js="html-content">
  <p>The Budget Lab modeled the economic and fiscal impact of the tariff proposal both with and without retaliation.<sup>2</sup> The results are summarized in the table above.</p><ul><li><strong>Aggregate price effects.&nbsp;</strong>The proposed tariff puts upward pressure on the PCE price level of 0.72-0.76% before consumer substitution, depending on the extent of retaliation from Canada, Mexico, and China. Pre-substitution is the best way to gauge the hit to consumer welfare. That is the equivalent of a loss of purchasing power of about $1,250 on average per household in 2024$.</li></ul><p>Even after consumers substitute, and assuming the Federal Reserve does not tighten monetary policy to counteract the tariff’s price effects, the level of PCE prices is still persistently 0.6% higher in the medium-term, a loss in purchasing power of about $1,000 per household in 2024$.</p><ul><li><strong>Output effects.&nbsp;</strong>In the medium-to-long run, the size of the US economy is persistently 0.2% smaller in real terms under the package, even after the US and global economies rebalance. This long-run result does not differ meaningfully between retaliation and no retaliation scenarios.<sup>3 4</sup></li><li><strong>Fiscal effects.&nbsp;</strong>Over 2026-2035, this tariff package raises $1.4-1.5 trillion under “relaxed” conventional assumptions (keeping income constant for the US but allowing it to fall for foreign countries). Conventional revenues under retaliation are 6% smaller than under non-retaliation assumptions.</li></ul><p>Net revenues would, in reality, likely be even lower than this once dynamic effects are taken into account, given the smaller size of the US economy. Under Congressional Budget Office (CBO) rules of thumb, a -0.2% permanent shock to the size of the US economy that phases in over three years—akin to how The Budget Lab models tariff impacts—lowers revenues by an additional roughly-$130 billion over a decade.</p><ul><li><strong>Average effective tariff rate.&nbsp;</strong>The average effective tariff rate would rise by approximately 6.1-6.3 percentage points under the proposal, once consumers and businesses substituted towards domestic or non-tariffed imported goods. This would put the overall average effective tariff rate at 8.6-8.8%, the highest US average tariff rate since 1946.</li><li><strong>Commodity price effects.&nbsp;</strong>The figure below shows detail from GTAP on how the longer-run price level effects are distributed across different goods and services, and how prices would change for both domestic and imported products. These are the net effects after the US and global production re-balances to account for the tariffs. A few high-level observations:<ul><li>Tariffs not only raise prices for imports, but drive domestic producers to raise prices too, though by how much depends on the size of the tariff, the exposure of the market to both foreign and domestic competition, and the price sensitivity of customers.</li><li>Computers and electronics see the largest price increases. The average price rises 5.7%, which is a weighted average of the domestic price increase (0.8%) and imported price increase (6.5%).</li><li>Fresh produce (“Vegetables, fruits, nuts”) rises in price by 1.8% on average.</li><li>Crude oil prices rise 1.1% in the long run. Gasoline prices (“Petroleum, coal products”) rise 1.3% on average, the equivalent of an additional $0.04 per gallon in today’s prices. Note that these are longer-run effects after the US shifts its supply chains for crude oil; shorter-run effects on oil and gasoline prices may be larger.</li><li>Auto prices rise 3.9% on average, the result of a 6.9% rise in imported auto prices and a 1.8% rise in domestic auto prices.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>
