		<p><strong>Update:</strong> ESPN updated its recap of the match to include a mention of Alex Morgan at 8:59 a.m. ET on Monday, Sept. 9.</p>
<p>U.S. soccer legend Alex Morgan played her final professional match on Sunday, a 4-1 loss by her San Diego Wave to the North Carolina Courage.</p>

<p>The match, which was <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/nwsl/alex-morgan-final-match-wave-simulcast-cbs-espn-prime.html">simulcast across various networks and streaming services</a>, included a beautiful moment in which Morgan removed her cleats at midfield and <a href="https://twitter.com/espn/status/1832941203278450834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1832941203278450834%7Ctwgr%5Ee1d1d34319b7d851aa8409a188dafa5dc1967526%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsports.yahoo.com%2Falex-morgan-bids-emotional-farewell-in-final-game-of-her-soccer-career-013942733.html">tearfully waved to a Snapdragon Stadium crowd</a> that chanted her name while players surrounded and applauded her. After the match, in which she played 15 minutes and took a penalty kick, she spoke to the crowd to thank them for their support and say goodbye.</p>
<p>You’d never know any of that from the post-match report by ESPN Generative AI Services, which began providing recaps of National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) and the Premier Lacrosse League (PLL) games this week.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/697990">recap</a>, which was posted to ESPN’s website and apps at 8:52 pm ET, provides a standard rundown of the outcome before going into who scored goals and how the action played out. Nowhere in the 215-word recap is Morgan mentioned, let alone the fact that this was the two-time World Cup winner and Olympic gold medalist’s final pro match.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">No mention of Alex Morgan at all in ESPN’s AI-generated recap of the final game of her professional career.</p>
<p>The article did provide analysis on the performance of her teammate Kennedy Wesley, noting that she contributed “defensively as well as on offense” in Sunday’s game. <a href="https://t.co/bKpuGmfaSK">pic.twitter.com/bKpuGmfaSK</a></p>
<p>— Sports TV News &amp; Updates (@TVSportsUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/TVSportsUpdates/status/1832996217887879282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote>


<p>The recap did note that “[San Diego’s Kennedy] Wesley was the standout player, contributing defensively as well as on offense.”</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/tech/ai-moves-espn-tennis-channel-recaps-translation.html">announcement of the service</a>, ESPN made a point to note that “each AI-generated recap will be reviewed by a human editor to ensure quality and accuracy.” It’s unclear if the human editor failed to notice Morgan’s absence or also decided it was not worth mentioning.</p>

<p>You could certainly make the case that everything in the recap is accurate from a factual perspective. However, the fact that it doesn’t include any information about Morgan and how important this night was for her, the NWSL, and U.S. women’s soccer speaks to how these kinds of services can’t replicate human writers who can see an event from a 360-degree perspective.</p>
<p>ESPN did post a <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/41185132/alex-morgan-exits-final-game-early-san-diego">separate article on their outlets from writer Jeff Kassouf</a> that is all about Morgan and the emotional night. However, that article is located on the side menu of the AI-generated recap and is easy to miss.</p>

<p>ESPN says that the “AI-generated recaps aim to enhance coverage of under-served sports, providing fans with content that was previously unavailable.”</p>
<p>That begs a question. If you’re going to provide fans of underserved sports with poorly written recaps that don’t tell the full story, <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/tech/ai-moves-espn-tennis-channel-recaps-translation.html">what value are you really providing them</a>?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Synthetic diamonds are now purer, more beautiful, and vastly cheaper than mined diamonds. Beating nature took decades of hard graft and millions of pounds of pressure.</p><article><div role="presentation"><p>A diamond – from the Greek ἀδάμας (<!-- --><em>adámas</em>), meaning <!-- --><em>unconquerable</em> – is a three-dimensional cubic or hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms. As its bonds are strong and its atoms packed closely together, diamond is the hardest natural material and the least compressible. Diamonds have high thermal conductivity and high electrical resistivity, but can be combined with small amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and boron and made into semiconductors. A diamond’s surface does not easily stick to other materials, but moves smoothly against them. Diamonds are chemically inert and not toxic to living tissue. In their pure form, diamonds are colorless and have a high dispersion of light, but the presence of certain impurities can add magnificent color to diamond gemstones.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In nature, it takes billions of years to form a diamond. Most of the diamonds nature produces are too impure for jewelry or high-tech industry, and extracting them is costly and dirty. In the lab, diamonds can be made faster, purer, and cheaper, overcoming these problems and making possible new uses for diamonds that were previously unattainable.</p>



<!-- --><p>Scientists first manufactured diamonds in laboratories in the 1950s, imitating the conditions under which diamonds were produced in nature. The diamonds produced were initially small and impure and so useful only in low-tech industrial products such as abrasives and lubricants. Since then, diamond manufacturing technology has progressed: the generation process has become more controlled, new methods have been invented, and better catalysts have been discovered. Diamonds grown in the lab are now cheaper than mined diamonds and have superior physical, optical, chemical, and electrical properties. Consequently, they dominate the industrial market. In the past decade, diamond manufacturing technology progressed so much that it is now possible to mass-produce jewelry-quality diamonds in the lab. These lab diamonds are cheaper and more beautiful than mined diamonds. A perfectly cut, flawless lab diamond costs a fraction of the price of a mined diamond of lesser quality.</p>



<!-- --><p>Lab diamonds are a testament to the principle that what nature can do, man is capable of doing better.</p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>How diamonds are made</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>In 1773, in a series of experiments in the gardens of the Louvre, the French chemist Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier placed diamonds into a glass bell jar and then immersed the base of the jar in water.<!-- --><sup id="ref-1"></sup> Using a large, biconvex lens that measured 89 centimeters and weighed over 70 kilograms – the Palais-Royal burning glass – Lavoisier would concentrate the sun’s rays onto a diamond. Within minutes, the diamond on which the lens had been focused would evaporate completely; the others would blacken and lose mass.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In his <!-- --><a href="http://www.lavoisier.cnrs.fr/ice/ice_book_detail.php?lang=fr&amp;type=text&amp;bdd=lavosier&amp;table=Lavoisier&amp;bookId=6&amp;typeofbookId=5&amp;num=0">Memoir on the Destruction of the Diamond by Fire</a> Lavoisier recounts that these experiments had been conducted in ‘clear and serene’ weather, but on 14 August 1773 a light fog reduced the sun’s power. In the more moderate heat, the diamonds in the jar appeared ‘precisely as if they had been coated with black smoke in the flame of a lamp’, causing Lavoisier to conclude that diamond is susceptible to be reduced to coal – <!-- --><em>charbon</em> – in certain circumstances. Overturning the jar and pouring inside limewater before the air escaped, Lavoisier observed that a chalky substance was precipitated when both diamonds and coal were burned. However, he did not conclude that diamond and coal are the same substance, only that both are combustible bodies.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In his 1789 <!-- --><em>Elementary Treatise on Chemistry</em>, Lavoisier proposed that there exist basic chemical building blocks, of which carbon – from the Latin <!-- --><em>carbo</em>, meaning coal – is one. He would not live long enough to discover that diamond is an allotrope (a different physical form of the same element) of carbon.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In the senseless bloodshed that characterized the French Revolution, Lavoisier, who had also been a <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferme_g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale">tax farmer</a>, was accused of adulterating tobacco and defrauding the state. He was guillotined on 8 May 1794. An apocryphal story holds that in response to an appeal to spare his life so that he could continue his experiments, the Revolutionary judge Jean-Baptiste Coffinhal declared that ‘The Republic needs neither scholars nor chemists; the course of justice cannot be impeded’. Coffinhal himself would be executed for his brutality three months later, but the damage had already been done. As Lavoisier’s colleague, the mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange, mourned, ‘It took them only an instant to cut off this head, and one hundred years might not suffice to reproduce its like’.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Instead, <!-- --><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/106919">the discovery that diamond is carbon</a> would be made by the English chemist Smithson Tennant, in 1796. Tennant heated ‘two grains and a half’ (162 milligrams) of diamonds in a closed gold tube containing niter (potassium nitrate, KNO<!-- --><sub>3</sub>). When heated, the potassium nitrate released oxygen, increasing its concentration, so that the diamonds burned faster, and at a lower temperature. Tennant kept the gold tube ‘in a strong red heat’ for an hour and a half, after which the diamonds were completely burned. The reaction produced ‘fixed air’ (carbon dioxide). Extracting and measuring the carbon dioxide produced, Tennant noted that it had occupied the space of ‘a little more than 10.1 ounces [354 milliliters] of water’.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In the <!-- --><em>Memoirs</em> of the Royal Academy of Sciences for 1781, Lavoisier had published the <!-- --><a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k35800/f578.item">results of a series of experiments</a> in which he identified that ‘carbonic acid’ (carbon dioxide) contains 28.22 parts of ‘charcoal’ (carbon) for every 71.78 parts of ‘acidifying principle’ (oxygen) and, at similar temperatures and pressures to the air in Tennant’s laboratory, determined its weight to be 0.695 Parisian grains per cubic Paris inch (1.86 grams per liter). Using these measurements, Tennant computed that the carbon dioxide produced by burning an equal weight of charcoal ‘ought to occupy very nearly the bulk of 10 ounces [352 milliliters] of water’.<!-- --><sup id="ref-2"></sup></p>



<!-- --><p>On the basis that the quantity of carbon dioxide produced from burning equal weights of diamond and charcoal ‘does not differ much’, Tennant concluded that diamond ‘consists entirely of charcoal’. This astonishing result would be met with skepticism for two decades, until other scientists reproduced his results.</p>



<!-- --><p>Tennant had demonstrated that diamond is an allotrope of carbon, but diamond’s method of formation remained unknown. Motivated by the prospect of discovery and the allure of riches, nineteenth-century alchemists tried to turn charcoal into diamond by various means, including evaporation, explosions, and intense heat. None met with success.</p>



<!-- --><p>The most important of these researchers was the French chemist Henri Moissan. In 1886, Moissan succeeded in isolating the chemical element fluorine by means of electrolysis; for this, and for his research into high-temperature chemistry, he would win the 1906 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. <!-- --><a href="https://archive.org/details/electricfurnace00moisrich/page/n5/mode/2up">Considering the problem of synthesizing diamonds</a>, Moissan tested different forms of carbon – burnt sugar, charcoal, <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_carbon">gas carbon</a>, and <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_black">carbon black</a> – under the high heat of an electric arc furnace. In each of these experiments, the carbon would be converted into graphite, a different allotrope of carbon.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Moissan examined the geological records from sites where diamonds had been discovered – the alluvial sands of Brazil, the diamond pits of southern Africa, and the Canyon Diablo meteorite in Arizona – and made two important observations. First, he noticed that the diamonds of southern Africa, which were contained in<!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberlite"> rock that had been ‘thrust up . . . from the deeper layers of the earth’</a>, must have formed deep underground – ‘and thus pressure must have played a part at the moment of formation’.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Second, the diamonds that were discovered had not been attached to the ground in which they were buried; instead, they appeared as if they had formed ‘in the midst of a liquid’. Carbon, including diamond, dissolves easily in iron, and iron is frequently found near diamond sites, including the Canyon Diablo meteorite, where two small diamonds had been found in the middle of an iron mass. ‘In this case’, Moissan noted, ‘nature seems to have been caught in the act’.</p>



<!-- --><p>The Canyon Diablo meteorite suggested how diamonds might form. Molten iron that contains dissolved carbon might cool suddenly, ‘due to some cause or other’, causing it to contract ‘violently’, pressurizing the dissolved carbon to crystallize into diamonds. To replicate this process in his lab, Moissan heated crucibles containing iron and burnt sugar to 3,000°C and then quenched them in cooler substances: water, iron filings, and molten lead. In the residues, under a microscope, he discovered dense fragments of carbon, some black, others transparent, that scratched rubies, combusted in oxygen, and had ‘a very distinct crystalline appearance’. Moissan measured the relative density of these fragments to be 3.5 (compared to water) and observed that when burnt in oxygen at 900°C they yielded 3.666 grams of carbon dioxide per gram of substance. ‘These properties’, he declared, ‘are possessed by the natural diamond alone’.</p>

<!-- --><p>Moissan would go to his death in 1907 believing that he had synthesized diamonds. Other chemists, including Henry Louis Le Chatelier, were skeptical and his experiments did not replicate. The German chemist Otto Ruff and the English engineer Sir Charles Parsons separately believed that they had reproduced his results, only to repudiate their findings after more careful examination. Moissan’s widow would later tell Parsons that she believed one of Moissan’s assistants had introduced natural diamond fragments into the experiments ‘in order to please the old man’. Nonetheless, despite his failure, Henri Moissan was correct to believe that diamonds could be synthesized under a combination of high pressure and high temperature, catalyzed by a metal solvent.<!-- --><sup id="ref-3"></sup></p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>High pressure, high temperature</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>In 1950, the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady, New York, assembled a consortium of chemists, physicists, and engineers to form Project Superpressure, an effort to synthesize diamonds in the lab. General Electric, the industrial conglomerate founded by the inventor Thomas Edison, had a strong tradition of industrial research and the cost of importing diamonds, used to draw out the tungsten filament wire in light bulbs, was a serious concern. To support its research, General Electric commissioned a hydraulic press that cost $125,000,<!-- --><sup id="ref-4"></sup> stood two storeys high, and was capable of pressing 1,000 tons.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Four years of intense experimentation followed, during which Project Superpressure exhausted all of its original research budget and two additional funding allocations. On the third occasion that the project manager asked for more money, General Electric’s research managers, having seen no tangible results and skeptical of future success, almost unanimously voted to discontinue their support. Guy Suits, General Electric’s director of research, overruled them and approved the funds. Shortly after, Project Superpressure would make its breakthrough.</p>



<!-- --><p>On 16 December 1954 chemist and Project Superpressure team member Howard Tracy Hall placed two diamond seed crystals into a graphite tube with iron sulfide, capped with tantalum disks. The tube’s graphite would act both as a carbon source and, when electric current was applied to the tantalum disks, a resistance heater.<!-- --><sup id="ref-5"></sup> He then placed this cylindrical device into a pressure chamber of his own design. Hall’s pressure chamber, now known as a belt press, consisted of two opposing tapered anvils that compressed the reaction cell from above and below, with the sides supported by prestressed steel bands.<!-- --></p>

<!-- --><p>Hall describes how when he envisioned this device, his colleagues ‘felt negatively about it’. His proposal to build a prototype, which would have cost General Electric less than $1,000,<!-- --><sup id="ref-6"></sup> was rejected and he was refused time in the machine shop to build it. ‘I fretted about this for a time’, <!-- --><a href="https://legacybk.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/HTH-Archives/Tracy">he wrote</a>, ‘and then decided on a sub-rosa solution. Friends in the machine shop agreed to build the Belt, unofficially, on slack time. This took several months. Ordinarily, it would have taken only a week.’<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>A practicing Mormon, whose church and large family left him little time to socialize with his colleagues, Hall attri­buted the refusal to build his design and other slights to religious prejudice. When his prototype belt apparatus proved capable of attaining high pressures and high temperatures, Hall requested that its critical components be reconstructed in carboloy (cobalt-cemented tungsten carbide). Once again, his request was refused and it was not until his former supervisor intervened that he obtained permission to buy the carbide components.</p>



<!-- --><p>To further compound Hall’s sense of injustice, demand for Project Superpressure’s thousand-ton press was so high that Hall’s improved pressure chamber was ‘relegated’ (in his words) to an ‘ancient’ press, dating from the turn of the twentieth century, that was only capable of pressing 400 tons and still ran on water pressure.<!-- --><sup id="ref-7"></sup> Hall would later describe how this press ‘leaked so badly that rubber footwear, mop, and bucket were standard accessory equipment’.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Using this antique press, Hall managed to compress his pressure chamber to ten gigapascals (about 100,000 times the pressure of the atmosphere) and to heat the reaction chamber to 1,600°C. The experiment ran for 38 minutes. Hall <!-- --><a href="https://legacybk.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/HTH-Archives/Tracy">had created diamonds</a>:<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>I broke open a sample cell after removing it from the Belt. It cleaved near a tantalum disk used to bring in current for resistance heating. My hands began to tremble; my heart beat rapidly; my knees weakened and no longer gave support. My eyes had caught the flashing light from dozens of tiny triangular faces of octahedral crystals that were stuck to the tantalum and I knew that diamonds had finally been made by man.</p>



<!-- --><p>General Electric reproduced Hall’s results 20 times over the next two weeks and on 15 February 1955 announced to the rest of the world that it had created the first diamonds in the lab. In its press release, it implied that the diamonds had been created in their new thousand-ton press. Hall’s reward was a modest salary increase – from $10,000 to $11,000 per year – and a ten-dollar savings bond. He resigned from General Electric to become a full professor at Brigham Young University.</p>



<!-- --><p>The diamonds that Hall’s process produced were tiny, measuring a few thousandths of a millimeter in diameter: just enough to glint. Diamonds of this size are too small for jewelry, but extremely useful in industry – at the time, they were (and still are) used for sawing, grinding, and polishing metal, drawing wire, and stamping precision components. General Electric’s industrial diamonds initially cost more than mined diamonds, but they quickly proved to be superior. Unlike in nature, the diamonds’ growth was precisely managed, and their shape and regularity could be made to order.</p>



<!-- --><p>Hall, meanwhile, was forbidden from disclosing details about the belt press he invented, or using it to pursue further research into high-pressure chemistry, because of a secrecy order imposed by the United States Department of Commerce. During the Second World War, the supply of diamonds had been a source of anxiety for both the Allied and Axis powers. The United States, which did not have a domestic supply of diamonds, was dependent on the De Beers cartel for the diamonds necessary for its industrial production, and the business model of De Beers was to drive up prices by artificially restricting the world’s supply.</p>



<!-- --><p>A 1944 memorandum to the United States attorney general declared that ‘the United States is paying monopoly prices for an essential material needed in wartime production’ and that if De Beers were an American company ‘there would be no question’ that it had violated antitrust laws. De Beers was headquartered in London and did not maintain a presence in the United States, so there was little the Justice Department could do. In an effort to maintain American technological superiority during the Cold War, the Commerce Department desired to prevent other countries from obtaining diamond-making technology, even if it meant restricting research within the United States too.</p>



<!-- --><p>Hall attempted to get around this problem by designing a better press. The belt press invented at General Electric transmitted pressure to the reaction cell on one axis only; he determined it could be improved by applying pressure from multiple directions. In 1957, Hall built a tetrahedral press that consisted of four triangular-faced anvils that pressured each of the sides of a tetrahedral reaction cell, and submitted <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1716172">a paper describing its design</a> to the <!-- --><em>Review of Scientific Instruments</em>.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>The Commerce Department placed a secrecy order on this design too and Hall was obligated to write to every person who had seen the tetrahedral press or requested a description of the device to inform them of this directive. ‘In exasperation, I considered giving up the field of high pressure’, <!-- --><a href="https://legacybk.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/HTH-Archives/Tracy">Hall would later write</a>. Many of the scientists to whom Hall communicated this directive thought the secrecy order was outrageous and complained to the Commerce Department. Other government agencies agreed and soon after, the Defense Department ordered the Commerce Department to abandon the secrecy orders on the belt and tetrahedral presses.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>The tetrahedral press was an improvement on the belt press, but more efficient still was the cubic press, which Hall, like other industrialists making diamonds around the same time, would find more practical. A cubic press uses six hydraulically powered anvils to put pressure on the six faces of a cubic reaction cell from each side. Compared to a tetrahedron, a cube has a smaller surface area to volume ratio. Because pressure is force divided by area, this means that the cubic press can achieve the pressures required to grow diamonds with less force.</p>

<!-- --><p>Scientists at the Siberian branch of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union pursued <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.2138/am.2011.3643">a different method</a> of manufacturing diamonds under high pressure and high temperature. Instead of using a hydraulic press, the Soviets made use of a split-sphere apparatus.<!-- --><sup id="ref-8"></sup> This consists of a cylindrical reaction cell that is surrounded by six inner anvils that fit together to form an octahedron. These inner anvils are, in turn, surrounded by eight outer anvils that fit together to form a sphere. Surrounding the sphere is a thin reservoir. A compact pressure pump injects hydraulic oil into the reservoir, pressuring the sphere from all directions at once. This causes the anvils to squeeze together, magnifying the pressure transmitted to the reaction cell at the center of the sphere (as the force is concentrated onto a smaller area). A graphite heater in the reaction cell provides the necessary heat.<!-- --></p>

<!-- --><p>Though the belt press, the cubic press, and the split-sphere apparatus have different pressure-delivery mechanisms, <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.2138/rmg.2022.88.13">the chemical reaction that occurs in the high-pressure cell</a> is the same: graphite is converted into diamond under high pressure and high temperature, catalyzed by a metal solvent and a small diamond ‘seed’ on which the new diamond precipitates.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Carbon atoms have four electrons in their outermost shell. At low pressures and temperatures, graphite – a solid that consists of two-dimensional sheets – is the most stable phase of carbon. In graphite, each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three other carbon atoms; the fourth electron is delocalized and free to conduct electricity. Graphite sheets are weakly held together by van der Waals forces: repulsions and attractions caused by fluctuations in the electron density of each atom.</p>

<!-- --><p>Under high pressure, diamond is the most stable form of carbon: each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four others, creating a tightly packed three-dimensional lattice. However, because the binding energy between carbon atoms is high, to convert graphite to diamond requires high temperatures.<!-- --><sup id="ref-9"></sup> When graphite is heated to 3,000°C under 15 gigapascals of pressure, its molecular structure changes to the tetrahedral shape characteristic of diamonds within seconds. Maintaining an even temperature and pressure is difficult under these conditions and so the diamonds produced tend to be small – measuring, at most, a few millimeters – and gritty. The cost of the equipment required to produce the necessary heat and pressure is prohibitively expensive.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Diamond makers use metal solvent catalysts to reduce the pressure and temperature required. In the reaction cell, diamond seeds, graphite, and a transition metal solvent such as iron are heated to 1,300°C–1,800°C and five to seven gigapascals of pressure are applied. The molten metal dissolves the graphite, breaking it down into individual carbon atoms.</p>



<!-- --><p>At high temperatures, the metal dissolves more carbon atoms. When the temperature falls, this is reversed: the carbon atoms are now supersaturated in the solvent and some of them precipitate out. Diamond manufacturers deliberately encourage this process by keeping the diamond seeds at a lower temperature than the metal, so that carbon atoms precipitate on their surface, growing them into larger diamonds. This process takes weeks, but compared to direct synthesis it is easier to control. The diamonds produced are larger and purer and have a more consistent, single-crystal structure.</p>

<!-- --><p>When making diamonds in a lab, <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.2138/rmg.2022.88.13">the most common impurities</a> to control are nitrogen and boron. These elements sit on either side of carbon on the periodic table and, being roughly the same size, are easily incorporated into a diamond’s lattice. Nitrogen colors diamonds yellow; boron colors them blue. Both are ubiquitous in the Earth and in the lab and it is difficult to exclude them from the carbon source, the metal solvent, and the reaction cell’s components. To stop nitrogen and boron from being absorbed into the diamond, manufacturers use chemical absorbers (called <!-- --><em>getters</em>) that react with them. Aluminum, titanium, and zirconium are common choices for both elements. When people want yellow or blue diamonds, nitrogen or boron can easily be added during production.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Pink diamonds need a few more steps. They are produced by introducing nitrogen into the reaction, irradiating the resulting yellow or brown diamond, and then heating the diamond. This process causes the lattice to rearrange itself so that, throughout the diamond, single nitrogen atoms are located next to single gaps in the lattice. These defects are called nitrogen-vacancy centers and they produce a pink hue. In quantum computing, pink diamonds have been proposed as <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-00742-4">a means of storing and manipulating quantum information at room temperature</a>.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>While diamonds were first produced in the lab in the 1950s, until the 2010s they were too small and too impure for jewelry. What made gem-quality lab diamonds possible was the meticulous investigation of the behavior of carbon at high pressures and high temperatures, a better understanding of the role of catalysts and getters, more precise control of the temperature gradients in the reaction cell, and competition from a new method of manufacturing diamonds.</p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>Chemical vapor deposition</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>During the 1950s, while Project Superpressure was recreating the high-pressure, high-temperature conditions under which diamonds form in the Earth, scientists at industrial laboratories in the United States and at the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in Moscow investigated a different technique for producing diamonds, not inspired by nature: chemical vapor deposition.</p>



<!-- --><p>With chemical vapor deposition, a solid material is deposited from a vapor that is undergoing a chemical reaction. As a manufacturing technique, it is as old as the cavemen, who would use soot from combustion for painting. To make diamonds using this process requires heating carbon to such a high temperature that it becomes a gas of isolated atoms, and then coaxing it to crystallize into a diamond structure as it cools.</p>



<!-- --><p>Graphite is the most thermodynamically stable phase of carbon at low pressures, but it is only slightly more stable than diamond. Because of this, whether the carbon gas con­denses as diamond or graphite hinges on how fast the diamond and graphite crystals form and grow.</p>



<!-- --><p>The first successful effort to produce diamonds using chemical vapor deposition occurred at Union Carbide. According to a <!-- --><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3030187A/en">patent application</a> filed by research scientist William Eversole in 1958, when a carbon-containing gas (either methane, CH<!-- --><sub>4</sub>, or carbon monoxide, CO) is heated to 900–1,100 degrees celsius at low pressure in the presence of diamond seed crystals, ‘diamond is deposited at a much faster rate than is black carbon [i.e., graphite]’. At the time, this was surprising. As the patent explains, ‘This is unexpected in view of the fact that thermodynamically, graphite is more stable than diamond’.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Periodically, the diamonds had to be cleaned: further growth would be ‘hampered by the accumulation of black carbon’. This could be done by exposing the diamonds to hot, pressurized hydrogen (H<!-- --><sub>2</sub>), which removes graphite faster than it removes carbon.<!-- --><sup id="ref-10"></sup> Unfortunately, the rate of diamond growth in this initial discovery (~0.01 micrometers per hour) was extremely slow and so the process could not be commercialized.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In the 1960s, the American chemist John Angus started an experimental program to investigate chemical vapor deposition diamond synthesis at Case Western Reserve University. Angus <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diamond.2014.08.004">recounts</a> that ‘the anonymous [National Science Foundation] reviewers were often scathing in their assessment of low-pressure diamond synthesis proposals, usually based on a misapplication of the second law of thermodynamics’ but the Defense Department were more sympathetic to high-risk proposals, ‘especially if they included, “The Russians are doing it”’.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In their experiments, both the Soviets and the Americans were forced to alternate diamond growth cycles with graphite-cleaning cycles. Angus’s group found that if they broke the H<!-- --><sub>2</sub> used in cleaning into atomic hydrogen, the reaction proceeded much faster. At a conference in Ukraine in 1971, John Angus discussed these results with the Russian chemist Boris Derjaguin. Shortly after, the Soviets stopped publishing.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>What the Soviets discovered was that by using atomic hydrogen during the growth phase, they could inhibit the formation of graphite in the first place. Furthermore, the hydrogen gasified and thus removed any graphite that did manage to form. This both eliminated the need for a separate cleaning phase and accelerated diamond growth. While the Soviets would publish this result in <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00923350">1978</a> and <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0248(81)90197-4">1981</a>, national security considerations prevented them from describing their experimental setup in sufficient detail for others to replicate their results.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Despite this secrecy, the results of these experiments attracted the attention of scientists at the Japanese National Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials, who began an intensive program of research into the role of atomic hydrogen in the chemical vapor deposition synthesis of diamonds. Using hot tungsten filaments, microwaves, and electric arcs to break hydrogen gas (H<!-- --><sub>2</sub>) into atomic hydrogen (H), these researchers – principally Mutsukazu Kamo, Seiichiro Matsumoto, and Yoichiro Sato – discovered how to grow diamonds at rates of several micrometers per hour, two orders of magnitude faster than Eversole.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Crucially, this research was done in the open: the growth methods were published in sufficient detail that other scientists could easily reproduce and extend their work, and the laboratory welcomed visitors. A large number of companies, universities, and research institutes in Japan, the United States, and Europe entered the field. Having been dismissed as being physically impossible two decades before, the manufacturing of diamonds using chemical vapor deposition had become the subject of intense research and development worldwide.</p>

<!-- --><p>In <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.2138/rmg.2022.88.13">a modern chemical vapor deposition reactor</a>, multiple diamond seeds are placed in a vacuum chamber with the reactant gasses – mostly hydrogen (H<!-- --><sub>2</sub>) and a small amount (generally less than one percent) of methane (CH<!-- --><sub>4</sub>). The diamond seeds are heated to 800°C–1,200°C. Microwaves are then used to heat the hydrogen gas (H<!-- --><sub>2</sub>) to 2,000°C–5,000°C, breaking its molecules into atomic hydrogen (H).<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Some of these unpaired hydrogen atoms will react with the carbon atoms on the surface of the diamond, creating a hydrogen-terminated surface that prevents the diamond crystal from reconstructing itself as graphite.<!-- --><sup id="ref-11"></sup> However, because other unpaired hydrogen atoms will also abstract hydrogen from the diamond’s surface, not all of the carbon atoms will be terminated, leaving sites for other carbon atoms to be added.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>At the same time, atomic hydrogen will react with the methane, stripping away a hydrogen atom and leaving behind a methyl radical (CH<!-- --><sub>4</sub> + H → CH<!-- --><sub>3</sub> + H<!-- --><sub>2</sub>). The carbon atom in the methyl radical (CH<!-- --><sub>3</sub>) contains an unpaired electron. Some of these methyl radicals will react with unterminated carbon atoms on the diamond’s surface, growing it. The length of time required depends on the intended size; for gem-sized diamonds, it can take several weeks.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>A major advantage of chemical vapor deposition is that the reaction chamber is not subject to extreme pressure, and so the formation of the diamond is easier to monitor and to control. Chemical vapor deposition reactors are also less capital intensive than the presses required for high-pressure, high-temperature synthesis.</p>



<!-- --><p>Manufacturers can engineer chemical vapor deposition diamonds to precise physical, mechanical, thermal, and optical specifications by varying the temperature, pressure, and duration of the reaction and by adding desired impurities to the reactant gas. Improvements such as slightly increasing the pressure in the reaction chamber, using higher-powered microwaves, and adding a small amount of nitrogen and oxygen to the catalyst have made it possible to grow large, gem-quality diamonds.</p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>Identifying a lab diamond</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>In their pure form, lab diamonds and mined diamonds are physically, chemically, and optically identical. Both consist of three-dimensional lattices of carbon atoms. To tell them apart, trained gemologists look carefully for <!-- --><a href="https://www.gia.edu/hpht-and-cvd-diamond-growth-processes">impurities included during their formation</a>, and for <!-- --><a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/rimg/article/88/1/689/614940/Synthesis-of-Diamonds-and-Their-Identification">growth patterns that provide clues about their development</a>. Diamond-manufacturing technology has become so good that lab diamonds can be made to be purer than diamonds formed in the Earth. At the upper end of the market, it is not pos­sible to tell the difference between lab diamonds and mined diamonds with the naked eye.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Mined diamonds almost always contain nitrogen. In large quantities, this colors them yellow or brown; for colorless diamonds, this impurity can be detected using an optical spectrometer. Nitrogen-free diamonds that are formed in the Earth are extremely rare, and expensive. Conversely, nitrogen is almost always excluded from lab-grown diamonds.</p>



<!-- --><p>High-pressure, high-temperature diamonds can include traces of the metallic catalysts used to make them, particularly if the reaction is not carefully controlled. These can be identified using a microscope, and at high concentrations, iron and cobalt impurities can even be detected using a strong magnet. Chemical vapor deposition diamonds sometimes incorporate graphite, which appear as little pinpricks, comets, or flat clouds.</p>



<!-- --><p>High-pressure, high-temperature diamonds are subject to roughly uniform pressure during manufacturing, leading them to grow in both the cubic and octahedral directions. Even after being cut and polished, some evidence of these growth directions remains in the form of tiny grain lines. Chemical vapor deposition diamonds, deposited layer by layer, are cubic in form. Diamonds produced in the Earth are subject to uneven pressure; most end up octahedral, though some are also cubic or irregular.</p>

<!-- --><p>Because it’s so difficult to distinguish between mined and lab diamonds (even for jewelers), diamond grading institutions inscribe <!-- --><em>LG</em> or <!-- --><em>Laboratory-Grown</em> on the rim of lab-grown diamonds, visible at 20-times magnification.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>The future of jewelry</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>The tradition that diamonds are an integral part of an engagement proposal is the result of <!-- --><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/past/issues/82feb/8202diamond1.htm">a highly successful advertising campaign</a> by the De Beers cartel. During the Great Depression, diamond sales slumped. De Beers responded by enlisting Hollywood actors and socialites in a campaign to associate diamond rings with marriage proposals, commissioning portraits of them showing off their new engagement rings, and by running ads showing happy young couples honeymooning above the now-famous slogan ‘A Diamond Is Forever’. In time, it also tried to persuade men that they would need to spend <!-- --><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27371208">a fixed proportion of their income</a> on a stone to win at love. One later advert, from the 1980s, was captioned ‘2 months’ salary showed the future Mrs Smith what the future would be like’.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>De Beers’s campaign <!-- --><a href="https://meltingasphalt.com/ads-dont-work-that-way/">worked</a> because people desire signifiers of commitment that are credible and socially sanctioned. Diamond engagement rings suit this purpose because they are beautiful and practical and their symbolism is well-known. While the mine owners benefited most from this arrangement, the high price was a costly – and therefore credible – signal of wealth and commitment and, in an era where this mattered, <!-- --><a href="https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/law_faculty_scholarship/576/">insurance against breach of promise to marry</a>. Peer pressure and status anxiety reinforced this norm.<!-- --></p>



    <!-- --><figure>
        <!-- -->
    <!-- --></figure>




<!-- --><p>Lab diamonds have destroyed this equilibrium. Competition among diamond manufacturers and technological progress in diamond making mean that lab diamonds are indistinguishable from mined diamonds, but cost much, much less – and the price is falling. In 2016, a one-carat near-colorless and very slightly included round brilliant lab-grown diamond cost $5,440, according to diamond analyst <!-- --><a href="https://www.paulzimnisky.com/">Paul Zimnisky</a>; in 2024, the same stone cost $1,325. (The price of an equivalent mined diamond decreased from $6,538 to $5,035.) In the past few years, sales of lab diamonds have started to overtake mined diamonds. A <!-- --><a href="https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-data-insights/real-weddings-study">survey by The Knot of nearly 10,000 couples married in 2023</a> revealed that lab diamonds accounted for 46 percent of engagement rings (compared with 39 percent who opted for a mined diamond), up from 12 percent in 2019.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Diamonds will continue to symbolize engagement – the tradition is now well established – but on its own, the raw material will cease to be a symbol of wealth or sacrifice. Lab diamonds can already be made to be clearer and more colorless than mined diamonds – or, if the wearer desires it, to have a more magnificent color. To complement this, consumers are demanding better workmanship in the cutting and polishing of the stone and in the <!-- --><a href="https://www.nigeloreilly.com/">design and manufacturing of its setting</a>.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>The <!-- --><a href="https://www.igi.org/gemblog/what-are-hearts-arrows-diamonds/">‘hearts and arrows’</a> optical pattern, which is present only in round brilliant diamonds that are perfectly cut, is a good example of this trend. Previously, perfectly cut diamonds were extremely rare, and too expensive for most customers. Now, because of strong demand, the International Gemological Institute has begun to note the presence of the hearts and arrows pattern on their <!-- --><a href="https://www.igi.org/reports/hearts-arrows">diamond grading certificates</a>.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>As lab diamonds can be engineered to be more beautiful than mined diamonds, we should expect them to be used more often in fine jewelry. Lab diamonds won’t end conspicuous consumption, but it will be the consumer and not the mine owners who enjoy most of the benefits.</p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>Diamonds in industry</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>While the beauty of diamonds has made them synonymous with jewelry, most diamonds, mined or lab-grown, are produced for industrial use. Diamonds have excellent physical, optical, thermal, chemical, mechanical, and electrical properties, which makes them useful in manufacturing, construction, mining, medicine, electronics, and other industries. Mined diamonds, being too impure, do not perform as well as lab diamonds when used for industrial purposes. Moreover, lab diamonds can be manufactured to required specifications more reliably and cheaply. In industry, lab-grown diamonds have eclipsed mined diamonds for several decades, and improvements in diamond-manufacturing technology are spurring progress in other fields.</p>

<!-- --><p>Polycrystalline diamond drill bits, made by fusing together diamond grit under high pressure and high temperature, are indispensable in oil and gas drilling, where they are stronger, faster, and more durable than tungsten carbide, the best alternative. Oil and gas wells often need to be drilled several kilometers deep, and replacing a broken or worn drill bit is a time-consuming process that requires pulling up and breaking apart the entire drill string. Using diamond-tipped drill bits has reduced the need for these replacements, saving money. There are some particularly hard rock formations that would be impossible to drill without them.</p>



<!-- --><p>Because of their strength, durability, and precision, diamond-tipped drill bits are also used to drill into glass, masonry, ceramics, and teeth. Other applications of diamond that make use of its hardness include grinding and polishing concrete, granite, and marble; <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_drawing">drawing wire</a>; and coating other materials to make them more hard-wearing. As materials science advances and creates tougher alloys, polymers, ceramics, and composites, it is almost certain that diamond tools will be needed to cut and shape them.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>As an optical material, diamonds have tremendous potential, because they are transparent, dissipate heat quickly, and do not expand much at high temperatures. In particular, diamonds are useful in high-powered lasers, which are used in cutting, welding, sensing, ignition, and medical surgery. A major problem with existing high-powered lasers is that their components are damaged by or deteriorate under high heat, limiting their output. An example of this is the <!-- --><a href="https://www.rp-photonics.com/thermal_lensing.html">thermal lensing</a> effect, where high and uneven temperatures change how the optical window of the laser bends light. This degrades the focus and alignment of the laser beam. Diamond, however, is an excellent window material, being a good conductor of heat and transmitter of light and having a refractive index that does not vary much with temperature. Diamonds can also be used as heat spreaders to cool down other components in lasers, increasing the maximum power that can be generated.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>An ongoing area of research is the use of diamonds as the active laser medium: the component that optically amplifies light. To do this will require diamonds that are larger, purer, and more structurally perfect than what nature can provide and so will depend on advances in diamond-manufacturing technology.</p>



<!-- --><p>Even more promising, diamond has the potential to be an <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ma14227081">excellent semiconductor</a>. Diamond has excellent thermal conductivity, because the regularity of its lattice and the strength of its bonds enable heat to be transferred quickly and efficiently. It has a wide band gap – in other words, it requires a high (but not insurmountable) amount of energy to promote one of its electrons into the conduction band. This means diamond can handle higher temperatures and voltages than conventional semiconductors, making it useful not only in devices that operate in extreme conditions (such as engines, radio towers, drilling equipment, spacecrafts, solar panels, and the electricity grid) but also for increasing microchip performance more generally.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Most microchips today are made from silicon, a metalloid that sits one row below carbon on the periodic table and has a thermal conductivity of 1.5 watts per centimeter-kelvin. Diamond, by contrast, has a thermal conductivity of 22 watts per centimeter-kelvin. Over the past five decades, the number of transistors on a microchip has increased <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">at an exponential rate</a>, while the microchips themselves have become smaller. Chip designers have therefore had to contend with the ever-increasing problem of dissipating the heat that is generated. <!-- --><a href="https://semiengineering.com/the-rising-price-of-power-in-chips">Heat degrades the performance of microchips</a> and limits how tightly transistors can be packed together.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>To overcome this problem, manufacturers have lowered the voltage and devoted a large amount of space and energy to cooling and ventilation systems. Because diamond dissipates heat much faster than silicon, diamond-based microchips can be made smaller and operate in more extreme temperatures. On existing silicon-based microchips, diamonds are already being used as heat spreaders.</p>



<!-- --><p>Diamond also has a wider band gap than silicon (5.45 electron volts vs. 1.1 electron volts) and consequently diamond microchips can operate at higher voltages than silicon microchips. Semiconductors are engineered to precisely control the flow of electricity, but above a certain voltage their electrical resistance breaks down, resulting in an uncontrolled flow of current. Diamond undergoes electrical breakdown at ten millivolts per centimeter, compared to 0.3 for silicon, making it more suitable for high-voltage applications such as power generation and distribution. Furthermore, for a given voltage, less material is needed and so diamond microchips can be made to be smaller.</p>



<!-- --><p>Compared to other wide band gap semiconductors, electrons and electron holes<!-- --><sup id="ref-13"></sup> move quickly through diamonds. This is important, because it means that signals are transported through diamonds faster. A conservative estimate places diamond’s electron and electron hole mobilities at 1,000 cm<!-- --><sup>2</sup>/Vs (square centimeters per volt-second) and 2,000 cm<!-- --><sup>2</sup>/Vs respectively, but <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1074374">electron mobilities as high as 4,500 cm<!-- --><sup>2</sup>/Vs and hole mobilities as high as 3,800 cm<!-- --><sup>2</sup>/Vs have been reported<!-- --></a>.

The cost is, at present, prohibitive (despite recent advances, diamond is still about <!-- --><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/this-diamond-transistor-is-still-raw-but-its-future-looks-bright">10,000 times more expensive than silicon</a>) and the diamond substrates required are larger than what can currently be made. Microchips are manufactured from extremely pure, single-crystal wafers, which are thin slices of semiconductor material. While semiconductor fabrication plants can manufacture silicon wafers to have diameters of up to 300 millimeters, at present diamond wafers are limited to ten millimeters if manufactured using the high-pressure, high-temperature process. Chemical vapor deposition diamond wafers can be made slightly larger, but the number of defects in the diamond and hence its utility as a semiconductor is typically worse.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>A more pressing problem is doping (that is, deliberately adding impurities to) the diamond to have the required electrical properties. In its pure form diamond is an electrical insulator. To use it as a semiconductor requires incorporating electron-donating impurities, to create an n-type semiconductor, or electron-accepting impurities, to create a p-type semiconductor.</p>



<!-- --><p>Creating a p-type diamond semiconductor is not hard: boron, the element to the left of carbon in the periodic table, has one fewer electron and hence is electron-accepting. When introduced as an impurity during the diamond-manufacturing process it is readily incorporated into the diamond’s lattice.</p>



<!-- --><p>Creating an n-type diamond semiconductor is harder. While nitrogen, the element to the right of carbon in the periodic table, has one surplus electron, <!-- --><a href="https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/j.p.goss/Research/NtypeDiamond/">the energy required to release this electron to the conduction band is extremely high</a>. Phosphorus, which is one period below nitrogen, is a more promising candidate, but because phosphorus is larger than carbon, incorporating it into the tightly packed diamond lattice is not easy. The energy required to release the surplus phosphorus electron is also high, though the situation is not as bad as it was with nitrogen. When such an n-type diamond semiconductor is used at high temperatures, this is less of a problem, as the required activation energy is readily available. However, for semiconductors intended to be used at room temperature, a more suitable electron donor must be found. This is an open problem.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>Not unconquerable</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>Nature takes billions of years to produce diamonds. Deep in the Earth’s mantle, the intense heat and high pressure slowly crystallizes carbon-containing fluids into diamonds. Volcanic eruptions transport these diamonds to the surface. Mining them is a dirty business – diesel-powered diggers excavate <!-- --><a href="https://www.imperial-consultants.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Final-report-Environmental-Impacts-of-Mined-Diamonds.pdf#page=19">1,000 tons of earth for every carat that is dug out of the ground</a>. Most mined diamonds are ugly, discolored, and impure.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In the lab, diamonds can be made to be purer, more beautiful, and more durable than what nature can achieve in less time and with fewer resources. If desired, specific impurities can be added to modify their optical, mechanical, and electrical properties. Initially, lab diamonds were manufactured using the high-pressure, high-temperature process, which was inspired by the method by which diamonds form in the Earth. Now they are also made using chemical vapor deposition, which has never been observed in nature.</p>



<!-- --><p>In Western civilization, a pernicious belief has taken hold, that what is ‘natural’ is good and what is man-made is inferior or harmful. Wordsworth, in his poem ‘<!-- --><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45557/the-tables-turned">The Tables Turned</a>’, expresses it best:<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><blockquote><p>Sweet is the lore which nature brings</p><p>Our meddling intellect </p><p>Mis-shapes the beauteous forms of things: — </p><p>We murder to dissect.</p></blockquote>



<!-- --><p>But human intellect and the scientific method are the foundations of our prosperity. Nature is not a superior craftsman: it is our resource, and we can and should improve upon it.</p>



<!-- --><p>In materials science, this has been obvious for a long time: steel, plastic, <!-- --><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/how-polyester-bounced-back/">polyester</a>, concrete, ceramics, and glass are unsurpassed by any natural substance. Lab diamonds are a further testament to this.<!-- --></p>

<h2>Parsing Dollar Figures</h2>



<p>One product of mine takes reports that come in as a table that’s been exported to&nbsp;PDF, which means text extraction. For dollar figures I find a prefixed dollar symbol and convert the number following it into a <code>float</code>. If there’s a hyphen in addition to the dollar symbol, it’s negative.</p>



<p><strong>Right?</strong></p>



<p>Well, when I was running reports through, negative values were coming out the other end as positive values.</p>



<p>Let’s look at this value as an example. (You can copy this into your interpreter and try it yourself.)</p>



<p><code>value = "‐$2,520.80"</code></p>



<p>Initially, I was using this regex to convert, retaining hyphens, dots, and any number from 0 to 9.</p>


<div><pre title="">import re
converted_value = float(re.sub(r"[^-.0-9]", "", value))
</pre></div>


<p>Result: <code><strong>2520.8</strong></code></p>



<p><em>Positive?</em> I found this confusing and thought that perhaps I didn’t understand what the hyphen in my regex was doing, so I tried taking the hyphen out of the regex, putting the negative case behind an if-statement and then hitting it with a multiplication of <code>-1</code>:</p>


<div><pre title="">if value.startswith('-$'):
    converted_value = float(re.sub(r"[^.0-9]", "", value)) * -1
</pre></div>


<p>The result?<strong> The if-statement is never triggered!</strong></p>



<h2>Inspecting the hyphen</h2>



<p>I was beginning to think I had taken the wrong crazy pills that morning. However, not long ago I read a chapter in <em>Fluent Python</em> by Luciano Ramalho (great book, by the way) about normalizing Unicode. So, I had been exposed recently to Unicode trickery.</p>



<p>I pulled in the standard library module <code>unicodedata</code> and starting checking things. I fed the standard hyphen character from my keypress as well as the hyphen from <code>value</code> into <code>unicodedata.name()</code>.</p>


<div><pre title="">&gt;&gt;&gt; unicodedata.name("-")
HYPHEN-MINUS

&gt;&gt;&gt; unicodedata.name(value[0])
HYPHEN
</pre></div>


<p>Whoa whoa whoa, what’s this!? These aren’t the same character, and I couldn’t tell by just looking at it. What’s the difference between <code>HYPHEN-MINUS</code> and <code>HYPHEN</code>?</p>



<p><strong>HYPHEN-MINUS (U+002D)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Intended Use</strong>: This character is meant to serve as a general-purpose hyphen, minus sign, or dash. It’s a legacy character inherited from ASCII.</li>



<li><strong>Appearance</strong>: It often appears as a small horizontal line, but the exact rendering can vary depending on the font and context.</li>



<li><strong>Usage</strong>: It’s commonly used in programming, file names, and where a quick, generic hyphen or minus sign is needed.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>HYPHEN (U+2010)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Intended Use</strong>: This character is explicitly designated as a hyphen, used to join words or split a word across lines.</li>



<li><strong>Appearance</strong>: It has a consistent appearance across different fonts and contexts, ensuring it looks like a proper hyphen.</li>



<li><strong>Usage</strong>: It is used in text where a typographically correct hyphen is required, such as in professionally typeset documents.</li>
</ul>



<h2>My Solution</h2>



<p>I needed to do something to account for this and make sure to catch not only this variation of a hyphen, but any such variation. For that, I leveraged <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_character_property" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_character_property">Unicode categories</a>.</p>



<p>The category for hyphens is ‘Pd’ (punctuation, dash).</p>


<div><pre title="">def is_hyphen(char: str) -&gt; bool:
    return unicodedata.category(char) == 'Pd'
</pre></div>


<p>And now can correctly identify any preceding dash in my if-statement.</p>


<div><pre title="">if is_hyphen(value[0]) and value[1] == "$":
    converted_value = float(re.sub(r"[^.0-9]", "", value)) * -1
</pre></div>


<p>Result: <strong>-2520.8</strong></p>

In this paper, we conduct a systematic examination of QUIC's performance over high-speed networks. We find that over fast Internet, the UDP+QUIC+HTTP/3 stack suffers a data rate reduction of up to 45.2% compared to the TCP+TLS+HTTP/2 counterpart. Moreover, the performance gap between QUIC and HTTP/2 grows as the underlying bandwidth increases. We observe this issue on lightweight data transfer clients and major web browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera), on different hosts (desktop, mobile), and over diverse networks (wired broadband, cellular). It affects not only file transfers, but also various applications such as video streaming (up to 9.8% video bitrate reduction) and web browsing. Through rigorous packet trace analysis and kernel- and user-space profiling, we identify the root cause to be high receiver-side processing overhead, in particular, excessive data packets and QUIC's user-space ACKs. We make concrete recommendations for mitigating the observed performance issues.</p></section><div id="backmatter" data-extent="backmatter"><section id="supplementary-materials" data-type="supplementary-material"><h2>Supplemental Material</h2><div><ul><li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/suppl/10.1145/3589334.3645323/suppl_file/QUIC%20is%20not%20Quick%20Enough%20over%20Fast%20Internet.mp4" download="QUIC is not Quick Enough over Fast Internet.mp4">Download</a></li><li>75.36 MB</li></ul></div><div><ul><li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/suppl/10.1145/3589334.3645323/suppl_file/rfp0090.mp4" download="rfp0090.mp4">Download</a></li><li>36.53 MB</li></ul></div></section><section id="bibliography" role="doc-bibliography"><h2>References</h2><div role="list"><div role="listitem" data-has="label"><p>[1]</p><div id="ref-00001"><p>1998. cURL - command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs. https://curl.se/.</p></div></div><div role="listitem" data-has="label"><p>[2]</p><div id="ref-00002"><p>2001.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div>
<p><em>Sep 3, 2024</em></p>
<p>AT Protocol is the tech developed at <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a> for open social networking. In this article we're going to explore AT Proto from the perspective of distributed backend engineering.</p>
<p>If you've ever built a backend with <a href="https://milinda.pathirage.org/kappa-architecture.com/">stream-processing</a>, then you're familiar with the kind of systems we'll be exploring. If you're not — no worries! We'll step through it.</p>

<p>The classic, happy Web architecture is the “one big SQL database” behind our app server. The app talks to the database and handles requests from the frontend.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1169" height="1600" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage1.c6dcf0c4.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage1.c6dcf0c4.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage1.c6dcf0c4.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>As our application grows, we hit some performance limits so we toss some caches into the stack.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1229" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage2.693478de.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage2.693478de.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage2.693478de.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Then let's say we scale our database horizontally through sharding and replicas.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1457" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage3.88182e12.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage3.88182e12.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage3.88182e12.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>This is pretty good, but we're building a social network with hundreds of millions of users; even this model hits limits. The problem is that our SQL database is “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_consistency">strongly consistent</a>” which means the state is kept uniformly in sync across the system. Maintaining strong consistency incurs a performance cost which becomes our bottleneck.</p>
<p>If we can relax our system to use “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">eventual consistency</a>,” we can scale much further. We start by switching to a NoSQL cluster.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1492" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage4.524d9b4a.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage4.524d9b4a.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage4.524d9b4a.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>This is better for scaling, but without SQL it's becoming harder to build our queries. It turns out that SQL databases have a lot of useful features, like JOIN and aggregation queries. In fact, our NoSQL database is really just a key-value store. Writing features is becoming a pain!</p>
<p>To fix this, we need to write programs which generate precomputed views of our dataset. These views are essentially like cached queries. We even duplicate the canonical data into these views so they're very fast.</p>
<p>We'll call these our View servers.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1378" height="1038" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage5.5e756a1a.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage5.5e756a1a.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage5.5e756a1a.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Now we notice that keeping our view servers synced with the canonical data in the NoSQL cluster is tricky. Sometimes our view servers crash and miss updates. We need to make sure that our views stay reliably up-to-date.</p>
<p>To solve this, we introduce an event log (such as <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a>). That log records and broadcasts all the changes to the NoSQL cluster. Our view servers listen to — and replay — that log to ensure they never miss an update, even when they need to restart.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1183" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage6.9e038bff.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage6.9e038bff.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage6.9e038bff.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>We've now arrived at a <a href="https://milinda.pathirage.org/kappa-architecture.com/">stream processing architecture</a>, and while there are a lot more details we could cover, this is enough for now.</p>
<p>The good news is that this architecture scales pretty well. We've given up strong consistency and sometimes our read queries lag behind the most up to date version of the data, but the service doesn't drop writes or enter an incorrect state.</p>
<p>In a way, what we've done is custom-built a database by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9hR3kiOK0">turning it inside-out</a>. We simplified the canonical storage into a NoSQL cluster, and then built our own querying engine with the view servers. It's a lot less convenient to build with, but it scales.</p>

<p>The goal of AT Protocol is to interconnect applications so that their backends share state, including user accounts and content.</p>
<p>How can we do that? If we look at our diagram, we can see that most of the system is isolated from the outside world, with only the App server providing a public interface.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1094" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage7.0e152275.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage7.0e152275.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage7.0e152275.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Our goal is to break this isolation down so that other people can join our NoSQL cluster, our event log, our view servers, and so on.</p>
<p>Here's how it's going to look:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1109" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage8.8cde2a8c.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage8.8cde2a8c.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage8.8cde2a8c.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Each of these internal services are now external services. They have public APIs which anybody can consume. On top of that, anybody can create their own instances of these services.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make it so anybody can contribute to this decentralized backend. That means that we don't just want one NoSQL cluster, or one View server. We want lots of these servers working together. So really it's more like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="925" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage9.a51ae040.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage9.a51ae040.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage9.a51ae040.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>So how do we make all of these services work together?</p>

<p>We're going to establish a shared data model called the <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/data-repos">“user data repository.”</a></p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="438" height="464" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage10.6817a213.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage10.6817a213.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage10.6817a213.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Every data repository contains JSON documents, which we'll call “records”.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="838" height="554" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage11.4f73b780.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage11.4f73b780.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage11.4f73b780.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>For organizational purposes, we'll bucket these records into “collections.”</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="870" height="570" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage12.bd8affbd.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage12.bd8affbd.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage12.bd8affbd.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Now we're going to opinionate our NoSQL services so they all use this <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/data-repos">data repository</a> model.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1010" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage13.88b82924.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage13.88b82924.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage13.88b82924.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Remember: the data repo services are still basically NoSQL stores, it's just that they're now organized in a very specific way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each user has a data repository.</li>
<li>Each repository has collections.</li>
<li>Each collection is an ordered K/V store of JSON documents.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the data repositories can be hosted by anybody, we need to give them <a href="https://atproto.com/specs/at-uri-scheme">URLs</a>.</p>

<p>While we're at it, let's create a <a href="https://atproto.com/specs/at-uri-scheme">whole URL scheme</a> for our records too.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="816" height="600" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage15.b82b14bb.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage15.b82b14bb.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage15.b82b14bb.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Great! Also, since we're going to be syncing these records around the Internet, it would be a good idea to cryptographically sign them so that we know they're authentic.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1510" height="964" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage16.1d02511f.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage16.1d02511f.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage16.1d02511f.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>

<p>Now that we've set up our high-scale decentralized backend, let's map out how an application actually works on ATProto.</p>
<p>Since we're making a new app, we're going to want two things: an app server (which hosts our API &amp; frontend) and a view server (which collects data from the network for us). We often bundle the app &amp; view servers, and so we can just call it an “Appview.” Let's start there:</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1294" height="876" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage17.bdea24e3.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage17.bdea24e3.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage17.bdea24e3.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>A user logs into our app using OAuth. In the process, they tell us which server hosts their data repository, <em>and</em> they give us permission to read and write to it.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1256" height="1338" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage18.5b6c97f8.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage18.5b6c97f8.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage18.5b6c97f8.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>We're off to a good start — we can read and write JSON documents in the user's repo. If they already have data from other apps (like a profile) we can read that data too. If we were building a singleplayer app, we'd already be done.</p>
<p>But let's chart what happens when we write a JSON document.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1324" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage19.6cb5a9de.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage19.6cb5a9de.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage19.6cb5a9de.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>This commits the document to the repo, then fires off a write into the event logs which are listening to the repo.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="827" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage20.032fb864.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage20.032fb864.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage20.032fb864.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>From there, the event gets sent to any view services that are listening — including our own!</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="846" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage21.d3fed181.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage21.d3fed181.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage21.d3fed181.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Why are we listening to the event stream if we're the one making the write? Because we're not the only ones making writes! There are lots of user repos generating events, and lots of apps writing to them!</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="950" height="1250" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage22.da5edbc6.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage22.da5edbc6.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage22.da5edbc6.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>So we can see a kind of circular data flow throughout our decentralized backend, with writes being committed to the data repos, then emitted through the event logs into the view servers, where they can be read by our applications.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1013" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage23.5342b3db.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage23.5342b3db.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage23.5342b3db.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>And (one hopes) that this network continues to scale: not just to add capacity, but to create a wider variety of applications sharing in this open applications network.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="1504" height="1082" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage24.2111e734.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage24.2111e734.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://atproto.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fimage24.2111e734.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>

<p>The AT Protocol merges p2p tech with high-scale systems practices. Our founding engineers were core <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dat_(software)">Dat</a> engineers, and Martin Kleppmann — the author of <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/">Data Intensive Applications</a> — is an active technical advisor.</p>
<p>Before Bluesky was started, we established a clear requirement of “no steps backwards.” We wanted the network to feel as convenient and global as every social app before it, while still working as an open network. This is why, when we looked at federation and blockchains, the scaling limits of those architectures stood out to us. Our solution was to take standard practices for high scale backends, and then apply the techniques we used in peer-to-peer systems to create an open network.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>How does Linux move from an awake machine to a hibernating one?
How does it then manage to restore all state?
These questions led me to read way too much C in trying to figure out
how this particular hardware/software boundary is navigated.</p>

<p>This investigation will be split into a few parts, with the first one going
from invocation of hibernation to synchronizing all filesystems to disk.</p>

<p>This article has been written using Linux version 6.9.9,
the source of which can be found in many places, but can be navigated
easily through the Bootlin Elixir Cross-Referencer:</p>

<p><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.9/source">https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.9/source</a></p>

<p>Each code snippet will begin with a link to the above giving
the file path and the line number of the beginning of the snippet.</p>

<h2 id="a-starting-point-for-investigation-syspowerstate-and-syspowerdisk">A Starting Point for Investigation: <code>/sys/power/state</code> and <code>/sys/power/disk</code></h2>

<p>These two system files exist to <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/power/basic-pm-debugging.html">allow debugging of hibernation</a>,
and thus control the exact state used directly.
Writing specific values to the <code>state</code> file controls the exact sleep mode used
and <code>disk</code> controls the specific hibernation mode<sup id="fnref:hibermode" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hibermode" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is extremely handy as an entry point to understand how these systems work,
since we can just follow what happens when they are written to.</p>

<h3 id="show-and-store-functions">Show and Store Functions</h3>
<p>These two files are defined using the <code>power_attr</code> macro:</p>

<p><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.9/source/kernel/power/power.h#L80">kernel/power/power.h:80</a></p>
<div><pre><code>#define power_attr(_name) \
static struct kobj_attribute _name##_attr = {   \
    .attr   = {             \
        .name = __stringify(_name), \
        .mode = 0644,           \
    },                  \
    .show   = _name##_show,         \
    .store  = _name##_store,        \
}
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>show</code> is called on reads and <code>store</code> on writes.</p>

<p><code>state_show</code> is a little boring for our purposes, as it just prints all the
available sleep states.</p>

<p><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.9/source/kernel/power/main.c#L657">kernel/power/main.c:657</a></p>

static ssize_t state_show(struct kobject *kobj, struct kobj_attribute *attr,

	return (s - buf);
}

<p><code>state_store</code>, however, provides our entry point.
If the string “disk” is written to the <code>state</code> file, it calls <code>hibernate()</code>.
This is our entry point.</p>

			return state;
	}
#endif

}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Could we have figured this out just via function names?
Sure, but this way we know for sure that nothing else is happening before this
function is called.</p>

<h3 id="autosleep">Autosleep</h3>

<p>Our first detour is into the autosleep system.
When checking the state above, you may notice that
the kernel grabs the <code>pm_autosleep_lock</code> before checking the current
state.</p>

<p>autosleep is a mechanism <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/479841/">originally from Android</a>
that sends the entire system to either suspend or hibernate whenever it is
not actively working on anything.</p>

<p>This is not enabled for most desktop configurations, since it’s primarily
for mobile systems and inverts the standard suspend and hibernate interactions.</p>

<p>This system is implemented as a workqueue<sup id="fnref:workqueue" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:workqueue" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
that checks the current number of wakeup events, processes and drivers that
need to run<sup id="fnref:wakeupevent" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wakeupevent" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, and if there aren’t any, then the system is put
into the autosleep state, typically suspend. However, it could be hibernate if
configured that way via <code>/sys/power/autosleep</code> in a similar manner to
using <code>/sys/power/state</code> to manually enable hibernation.</p>

<h2 id="the-steps-of-hibernation">The Steps of Hibernation</h2>

<h3 id="hibernation-kernel-config">Hibernation Kernel Config</h3>

<p>It’s important to note that most of the hibernate-specific functions below
do nothing unless you’ve defined <code>CONFIG_HIBERNATION</code> in your Kconfig<sup id="fnref:kconfig" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:kconfig" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.
As an example, <code>hibernate</code> itself is defined as the following if
<code>CONFIG_HIBERNATE</code> is not set.</p>

<p><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.9/source/include/linux/suspend.h#L407">include/linux/suspend.h:407</a></p>
<div><pre><code>static inline int hibernate(void) { return -ENOSYS; }
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="check-if-hibernation-is-available">Check if Hibernation is Available</h3>
<p>We begin by confirming that we actually can perform hibernation,
via the <code>hibernation_available</code> function.</p>

<p><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.9/source/kernel/power/hibernate.c#L742">kernel/power/hibernate.c:742</a></p>
<div><pre><code>if (!hibernation_available()) {
	pm_pr_dbg("Hibernation not available.\n");
	return -EPERM;
}
</code></pre></div>

<p><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.9/source/kernel/power/hibernate.c#L92">kernel/power/hibernate.c:92</a></p>
<div><pre><code>bool hibernation_available(void)
{
	return nohibernate == 0 &amp;&amp;
		!security_locked_down(LOCKDOWN_HIBERNATION) &amp;&amp;
		!secretmem_active() &amp;&amp; !cxl_mem_active();
}
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>nohibernate</code> is controlled by the kernel command line, it’s set via
either <code>nohibernate</code> or <code>hibernate=no</code>.</p>

<p><code>security_locked_down</code> is a hook for Linux Security Modules to prevent
hibernation. This is used to prevent hibernating to an unencrypted storage
device, as specified in the manual page
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/kernel_lockdown.7.html"><code>kernel_lockdown(7)</code></a>.
Interestingly, either level of lockdown, integrity or confidentiality,
locks down hibernation because with the ability to hibernate you can extract
bascially anything from memory and even reboot into a modified kernel image.</p>

<p><code>secretmem_active</code> checks whether there is any active use of
<code>memfd_secret</code>, and if so it prevents hibernation.
<code>memfd_secret</code> returns a file descriptor that can be mapped into a process
but is specifically unmapped from the kernel’s memory space.
Hibernating with memory that not even the kernel is supposed to
access would expose that memory to whoever could access the hibernation image.
This particular feature of secret memory was apparently
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/865256/">controversial</a>, though not as
controversial as performance concerns around fragmentation when unmapping
kernel memory
(<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/865256/">which did not end up being a real problem</a>).</p>

<p><code>cxl_mem_active</code> just checks whether any CXL memory is active.
A full explanation is provided in the
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=9ea4dcf49878bb9546b8fa9319dcbdc9b7ee20f8">commit introducing this check</a>
but there’s also a shortened explanation from <code>cxl_mem_probe</code> that
sets the relevant flag when initializing a CXL memory device.</p>

<p><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.9/source/drivers/cxl/mem.c#L186">drivers/cxl/mem.c:186</a></p>
<div><pre><code>* The kernel may be operating out of CXL memory on this device,
* there is no spec defined way to determine whether this device
* preserves contents over suspend, and there is no simple way
* to arrange for the suspend image to avoid CXL memory which
* would setup a circular dependency between PCI resume and save
* state restoration.
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="check-compression">Check Compression</h3>

<p>The next check is for whether compression support is enabled, and if so
whether the requested algorithm is enabled.</p>

<p><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.9/source/kernel/power/hibernate.c#L747">kernel/power/hibernate.c:747</a></p>
<div><pre><code>/*
 * Query for the compression algorithm support if compression is enabled.
 */
if (!nocompress) {
	strscpy(hib_comp_algo, hibernate_compressor, sizeof(hib_comp_algo));
	if (crypto_has_comp(hib_comp_algo, 0, 0) != 1) {
		pr_err("%s compression is not available\n", hib_comp_algo);
		return -EOPNOTSUPP;
	}
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>nocompress</code> flag is set via the <code>hibernate</code> command line parameter,

<h3 id="grab-locks">Grab Locks</h3>

<p>The next step is to grab the sleep and hibernation locks via
<code>lock_system_sleep</code> and <code>hibernate_acquire</code>.</p>

/* The snapshot device should not be opened while we're running */
if (!hibernate_acquire()) {

<p>First, <code>lock_system_sleep</code> marks the current thread as not freezable, which
will be important later<sup id="fnref:procfreeze" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:procfreeze" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>. It then grabs the <code>system_transistion_mutex</code>,
which locks taking snapshots or modifying how they are taken,
resuming from a hibernation image, entering any suspend state, or rebooting.</p>

<h4 id="the-gfp-mask">The GFP Mask</h4>
<p>The kernel also issues a warning if the <code>gfp</code> mask is changed via either
<code>pm_restore_gfp_mask</code> or <code>pm_restrict_gfp_mask</code>
without holding the <code>system_transistion_mutex</code>.</p>

<p>GFP flags tell the kernel how it is permitted to handle a request for memory.</p>

<p>In the case of hibernation specifically we care about the <code>IO</code> and <code>FS</code> flags,
which are reclaim operators, ways the system is permitted to attempt to free
up memory in order to satisfy a specific request for memory.</p>

}
</code></pre></div>

<p>There is an explanation of the conditions under which a switch is performed
in the comment above the function, but we’ll also walk through the steps here.</p>

<p>Firstly we grab the <code>vt_switch_mutex</code> to ensure nothing will modify the list
while we’re looking at it.</p>

<p>We then examine the <code>pm_vt_switch_list</code>.
This list is used to indicate the drivers that require a switch during suspend.
They register this requirement, or the lack thereof, via
<code>pm_vt_switch_required</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.9/source/kernel/power/console.c#L31">kernel/power/console.c:31</a></p>
<div><pre><code>/**

 * what may be running.
 *
 * Drivers can indicate support for switchless suspend/resume, which can
 * save time and flicker, by using this routine and passing 'false' as
 * the argument.  If any loaded driver needs VT switching, or the
 * no_console_suspend argument has been passed on the command line, VT
 * switches will occur.
 */
void pm_vt_switch_required(struct device *dev, bool required)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, we check <code>console_suspend_enabled</code>. This is set to false
by the kernel parameter <code>no_console_suspend</code>, but defaults to true.</p>

<p>Finally, if there are any entries in the <code>pm_vt_switch_list</code>, then we
check to see if any of them require a VT switch.</p>

<p>Only if none of these conditions apply, then we return false.</p>

<p>If a VT switch is in fact required, then we move first the currently active
virtual terminal/console<sup id="fnref:console" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:console" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> (<code>vt_move_to_console</code>)
and then the current location of kernel messages (<code>vt_kmsg_redirect</code>)
to the <code>SUSPEND_CONSOLE</code>.
The <code>SUSPEND_CONSOLE</code> is the last entry in the list of possible
consoles, and appears to just be a black hole to throw away messages.</p>

<p><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.9/source/kernel/power/console.c#L16">kernel/power/console.c:16</a></p>
<div><pre><code>#define SUSPEND_CONSOLE	(MAX_NR_CONSOLES-1)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Interestingly, these are separate functions because you can use
<code>TIOCL_SETKMSGREDIRECT</code> (an <code>ioctl</code><sup id="fnref:ioctl" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ioctl" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>) to send kernel messages to a specific virtual terminal,
but by default its the same as the currently active console.</p>

<p>The locations of the previously active console and the previous kernel
messages location are stored in <code>orig_fgconsole</code> and <code>orig_kmsg</code>, to
restore the state of the console and kernel messages after the machine wakes
up again.
Interestingly, this means <code>orig_fgconsole</code> also ends up storing any errors,
so has to be checked to ensure it’s not less than zero before we try to do
anything with the kernel messages on both suspend and resume.</p>

<p>However, if you do run your machine from a virtual terminal, then we
indicate to the system that we want to change to the requested virtual terminal
via the <code>want_console</code> variable
and schedule a callback via <code>schedule_console_callback</code>.</p>

<p>Each of these callbacks tends to be quite driver-specific, so we’ll cease
discussion of this here.</p>

<h3 id="sync-filesystems">Sync Filesystems</h3>
<p>The next step is to ensure all filesystems have been synchronized to disk.</p>

<p>This is performed via a simple helper function that times how long the full
synchronize operation, <code>ksys_sync</code> takes.</p>

<p><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.9/source/kernel/power/main.c#L69">kernel/power/main.c:69</a></p>
<div><pre><code>void ksys_sync_helper(void)

	pr_info("Filesystems sync: %ld.%03ld seconds\n",
		elapsed_msecs / MSEC_PER_SEC, elapsed_msecs % MSEC_PER_SEC);
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(ksys_sync_helper);
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>ksys_sync</code> wakes and instructs a set of flusher threads to write out
every filesystem, first their inodes<sup id="fnref:inode" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:inode" rel="footnote">15</a></sup>, then the full filesystem, and
then finally all block devices, to ensure all pages are written out
to disk.</p>

 * Finally, we writeout all block devices because some filesystems (e.g. ext2)

}
</code></pre></div>

<p>It follows an interesting pattern of using <code>iterate_supers</code> to run both
<code>sync_inodes_one_sb</code> and then <code>sync_fs_one_sb</code> on each known filesystem<sup id="fnref:superblock" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:superblock" rel="footnote">16</a></sup>.
It also calls both <code>sync_fs_one_sb</code> and <code>sync_bdevs</code> twice, first without waiting
for any operations to complete and then again waiting for completion<sup id="fnref:fscode" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fscode" rel="footnote">17</a></sup>.</p>

<p>When <code>laptop_mode</code> is enabled the system runs additional filesystem synchronization
operations after the specified delay without any writes.</p>

<p><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.9/source/mm/page-writeback.c#L111">mm/page-writeback.c:111</a></p>

 */
int laptop_mode;

EXPORT_SYMBOL(laptop_mode);
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, when running a filesystem synchronization operation, the system will
add an additional timer to schedule more writes after the <code>laptop_mode</code> delay.
We don’t want the state of the system to change at all while performing
hibernation, so we cancel those timers.</p>

<p><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.9/source/mm/page-writeback.c#L2198">mm/page-writeback.c:2198</a></p>
<div><pre><code>/*

	list_for_each_entry_rcu(bdi, &amp;bdi_list, bdi_list)
		del_timer(&amp;bdi-&gt;laptop_mode_wb_timer);

	rcu_read_unlock();
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>As a side note, the <code>ksys_sync</code> function is simply called when the
system call <code>sync</code> is used.</p>

<p><a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.9/source/fs/sync.c#L111">fs/sync.c:111</a></p>
<div><pre><code>SYSCALL_DEFINE0(sync)

}
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="the-end-of-preparation">The End of Preparation</h2>
<p>With that the system has finished preparations for hibernation.
This is a somewhat arbitrary cutoff, but next the system will begin
a full freeze of userspace to then dump memory out to an image and finally
to perform hibernation. All this will be covered in future articles!</p>

                            <p><em>Menlo Park, Calif. —</em>&nbsp;A lithium-ion battery’s very first charge is more momentous than it sounds. It determines how well and how long the battery will work from then on – in particular, how many cycles of charging and discharging it can handle before deteriorating.</p>

<p>In a study published today in&nbsp;<em>Joule</em>, researchers at the SLAC-Stanford Battery Center report that giving&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsbatteries">batteries</a>&nbsp;this first charge at unusually high currents increased their average lifespan by 50% while decreasing the initial charging time from 10 hours to just 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Just as important, the researchers were able to use scientific&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsmachine-learning">machine learning</a>&nbsp;to pinpoint specific changes in the battery electrodes that account for this increase in lifespan and performance – invaluable insights for battery manufacturers looking to streamline their processes and improve their products.</p>

<p>The study was carried out by a SLAC/Stanford team led by Professor Will Chueh in collaboration with researchers from the Toyota Research Institute (TRI), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Washington. It is part of SLAC's&nbsp;<a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/topics/sustainability">sustainability research</a>&nbsp;and a broader effort to reimagine our energy future leveraging the lab’s unique tools and expertise and partnerships with industry.</p>

<p>“This is an excellent example of how SLAC is doing manufacturing science to make critical technologies for the energy transition more affordable,” Chueh said. “We’re solving a real challenge that industry is facing; critically, we partner with industry from the get-go.”</p>

<p>This was the latest in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2023-09-13-computer-vision-reveals-unprecedented-physical-and-chemical-details-how-lithium-ion">series of studies</a>&nbsp;funded by TRI under a cooperative research agreement with the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.</p>

<p>The results have practical implications for manufacturing not just lithium-ion&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsbatteries">batteries</a>&nbsp;for electric vehicles and the electric grid, but for other technologies, too, said Steven Torrisi, a senior research scientist at TRI who collaborated on the research.</p>

<p>“This study is very exciting for us,” he said. “Battery manufacturing is extremely capital, energy and time intensive. It takes a long time to spin up manufacturing of a new battery, and it’s really difficult to optimize the manufacturing process because there are so many factors involved.”</p>

<p>Torrisi said the results of this research “demonstrate a generalizable approach for understanding and optimizing this crucial step in battery manufacturing. Further, we may be able to transfer what we have learned to new processes, facilities, equipment and battery chemistries in the future.”</p>

<p><strong>A “squishy layer” that’s key to battery performance</strong></p>

<p>To understand what happens during the battery’s initial cycling, Chueh’s team builds pouch cells in which the positive and negative electrodes are surrounded by an electrolyte solution where lithium ions move freely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When a battery charges, lithium ions flow into the negative electrode for storage. When a battery discharges, they flow back out and travel to the positive electrode; this triggers a flow of electrons for powering devices, from electric cars to the electricity grid.</p>

<p>The positive electrode of a newly minted battery is 100% full of lithium, said Xiao Cui, the lead researcher for the battery informatics team in Chueh’s lab. Every time the battery goes through a charge-discharge cycle, some of the lithium is deactivated. Minimizing those losses prolongs the battery’s working lifetime.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, one way to minimize the overall lithium loss is to deliberately lose a large percentage of the initial supply of lithium during the battery’s first charge, Cui said. It’s like making a small investment that yields good returns down the road.</p>

<p>This first-cycle lithium loss is not in vain. The lost lithium becomes part of a squishy layer called the solid electrolyte interphase, or SEI, that forms on the surface of the negative electrode during the first charge. In return, the SEI protects the negative electrode from side reactions that would accelerate the lithium loss and degrade the battery faster over time. Getting the SEI just right is so important that the first charge is known as the formation charge.</p>

<p>“Formation is the final step in the manufacturing process,” Cui said, “so if it fails, all the value and effort invested in the battery up to that point are wasted.”</p>

<p><strong>High charging current boosts battery performance &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Manufacturers generally give new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsbatteries">batteries</a>&nbsp;their first charge with low currents, on the theory that this will create the most robust SEI layer. But there’s a downside: Charging at low currents is time-consuming and costly and doesn’t necessarily yield optimal results. So, when recent studies suggested that faster charging with higher currents does not degrade battery performance, it was exciting news.</p>

<p>But researchers wanted to dig deeper. The charging current is just one of dozens of factors that go into the formation of SEI during the first charge. Testing all possible combinations of them in the lab to see which one worked best is an overwhelming task.</p>

<p>To whittle the problem down to manageable size, the research team used scientific&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsmachine-learning">machine learning</a>&nbsp;to identify which factors are most important in achieving good results. To their surprise, just two of them – the temperature and current at which the battery is charged – stood out from all the rest.</p>

<p>Experiments confirmed that charging at high currents has a huge impact, increasing the lifespan of the average test battery by 50%. It also deactivated a much higher percentage of lithium up front – about 30%, compared to 9% with previous methods – but that turned out to have a positive effect.</p>

<p>Removing more lithium ions up front is a bit like scooping water out of a full bucket before carrying it, Cui said. The extra headspace in the bucket decreases the amount of water splashing out along the way. In similar fashion, deactivating more lithium ions during SEI formation frees up headspace in the positive electrode and allows the electrode to cycle in a more efficient way, improving subsequent performance.</p>

<p>“Brute force optimization by trial-and-error is routine in manufacturing– how should we perform the first charge, and what is the winning combination of factors?” Chueh said. “Here, we didn’t just want to identify the best recipe for making a good battery; we wanted to understand how and why it works. This understanding is crucial for finding the best balance between battery performance and manufacturing efficiency.”</p>

<p>This research was funded by the Toyota Research Institute through its Accelerated Materials Design and Discovery program.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>In today’s world of fast-paced development and continuous integration, security vulnerabilities can be easy to overlook. Recently, I discovered a severe exploit chain, starting from a publicly exposed <code>.git</code> directory, which led to a full server takeover. This blog will walk through the chain of events, outlining how each weak point compounded the issue.</p>



<h2>Public Exposure of .git Directory</h2>



<p>A surprising number of websites still expose their <code>.git</code> directories to the public. When scanning for such exposures on a target, I noticed that the <code>.git</code> folder was publicly accessible. This is a serious vulnerability because <code>.git</code> stores the entire version history of a project, including configuration files, which might contain sensitive information.</p>

<p><strong>Impact</strong>: With access to <code>.git/config</code>, I found credentials, which opened the door to further exploitation. I could just clone the entire repository using the URL found inside the config file.</p>



<h2>Exploring the Repository and Discovery of Bitbucket Pipelines</h2>



<p>After cloning the repository using the found credentials, I began exploring the repository’s contents. In the process, I discovered that the code owners used Bitbucket Pipelines for deployment.</p>



<p>Bitbucket Pipelines allows you to automatically run code whenever someone interacts (pushes code, raises an issue, opens a PR and so on) with your repository. In this instance, the pipeline was set to log in to the production server, <code>cd</code> into the folder holding the source code, and run a <code>git pull</code>, which would update the running application’s source code. Here’s how a sample pipeline would look like:</p>



<pre><code>pipelines:
  branches:
    master:
      - step:
          name: Update deployment
          script:
            - pipe: atlassian/ssh-run:0.2.8
              variables:
                SSH_USER: 'ubuntu'
                MODE: 'command'
                SERVER: 'damn.vulnerable.site'
                COMMAND: 'cd /path/to/app &amp;&amp; git pull'</code></pre>



<p><strong>Key Findings</strong>: The pipeline configuration file revealed that SSH was being used to log into the production server as part of the automated deployment process.</p>



<h2>Pushing Malicious Changes to the Pipeline</h2>



<p>I modified the pipeline configuration to add my SSH key onto the production server’s <code>authorized_keys</code> file. By changing the pipeline configuration, I ensured that the next time the pipeline ran, my key would be added to the authorized SSH keys allowed to log in to the server. Here’s how my modified pipeline file looked like:</p>



<pre><code>pipelines:
  branches:
    master:
      - step:
          name: Pushed to Master
          script:
            - pipe: atlassian/ssh-run:0.2.8
              variables:
                SSH_USER: 'ubuntu'
                MODE: 'command'
                SERVER: 'damn.vulnerable.site'
                COMMAND: 'mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/.ssh &amp;&amp; echo ssh-rsa AAAA...snip...sw== &gt;&gt; /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys &amp;&amp; chmod 700 /home/ubuntu/.ssh &amp;&amp; chmod 600 /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys &amp;&amp; cd /path/to/app &amp;&amp; git pull'</code></pre>



<h2>SSH Access and Server Takeover</h2>



<p>After committing my changes and pushing them back to the repository, I just had to wait for the pipeline to be run. After a few minutes, I attempted logging in to the server, and it gladly granted me shell access. From here, the server was effectively compromised, and I had full control over it.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="522" src="https://blog.razzsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ssh-login-1024x522.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.razzsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ssh-login-1024x522.png 1024w, https://blog.razzsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ssh-login-300x153.png 300w, https://blog.razzsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ssh-login-768x392.png 768w, https://blog.razzsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ssh-login.png 1319w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p><strong>Final Step</strong>: I logged into the server, confirmed the SSH access worked, and had the ability to execute any command.</p>



<p>For those with a keen eye, there’s also an immediate <a href="https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/interesting-groups-linux-pe/lxd-privilege-escalation">privilege escalation vulnerability </a>which can be executed to gain root access.</p>



<h2>Mitigation Strategies</h2>



<p><strong>Monitor your SSH keys</strong>. Regularly review who has access to your production servers and remove any unnecessary or outdated keys.</p>



<p><strong>Never expose your <code>.git</code> directory publicly</strong>. Use server configurations to block access to this directory.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>This exploit chain highlights the risks associated with public exposure of sensitive directories and improper handling of CI/CD pipelines. It serves as a reminder to developers and sysadmins to audit their code repositories, deployment pipelines and server configuration regularly to prevent such attacks.</p>

<article id="post-1256">

	

	
	<div>
		
<p>This post is kind of part 3, coming off last week’s thrilling <a href="https://rakujourney.wordpress.com/2024/09/01/htmx-and-raku-cro-ii/">episode</a>.</p>



<p>I am a simple sole, I want to reduce the cognitive load in my web projects. The general idea is to go back to the halcyon early days of the web before Netscape dropped the JS-bomb. You know HTML for the layout and CSS for the style. An elegant division of roles.</p>



<p>When I read about <a href="http://htmx.org/">HTMX</a> it was clear that <a href="http://raku.org/">Raku</a> and <a href="http://cro.raku.org/">Cro</a> are ideal candidates for the back end HTML assembly, defining routes and serving RESTful APIs. As we have seen in the previous posts, HTMX eliminates the need for JS to make dynamic web content. Lovely.</p>



<p>Remember – we are talking simpler ways to build attractive, dynamic, modern websites. While HTMX is well suited to 90% of this, if you are building a webapp like FaceBook or Google Maps, then it’s not for you.</p>







<p>But what to do about style and CSS?</p>



<p>Well HTMX is neutral to CSS … it can be used with Bootstrap, Tailwind, SASS and so on. But many of these CSS tools have evolved to jam more stuff into the HTML tag attributes.</p>



<p>In my mind, the ideal would be something like this for a simple navbar:</p>


<div><pre title="">&lt;nav&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Products&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>I had heard that <a href="https://picocss.com/">Pico</a> CSS was often used in HTMX projects. And sure enough, the <a href="https://picocss.com/docs/nav">Pico Components</a> have this feel… </p>



<p>Here’s Bootstrap for contrast:</p>


<div><pre title="">&lt;nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light"&gt;
  &lt;div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav"&gt;
    &lt;ul class="navbar-nav ms-auto"&gt;
      &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
        &lt;a class="nav-link" href="#"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
        &lt;a class="nav-link" href="#"&gt;Services&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
        &lt;a class="nav-link" href="#"&gt;Product&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>What about Tailwind, also for contrast:</p>


<div><pre title="">&lt;nav class="bg-gray-100"&gt;
  &lt;div class="flex justify-end"&gt;
    &lt;ul class="flex space-x-3"&gt;
      &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
        &lt;a class="text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900" href="#"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
        &lt;a class="text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900" href="#"&gt;Services&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
        &lt;a class="text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900" href="#"&gt;Product&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>Bootstrap and Tailwind come at the cost of “more stuff in the HTML tags”.</p>



<p>Here’s the Pico CSS example:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1266" data-permalink="https://rakujourney.wordpress.com/2024/09/08/htmx-raku-and-pico-css/screenshot-2024-09-08-at-09-55-33/" data-orig-file="https://rakujourney.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-09-08-at-09.55.33.png" data-orig-size="1784,844" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screenshot 2024-09-08 at 09.55.33" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://rakujourney.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-09-08-at-09.55.33.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://rakujourney.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-09-08-at-09.55.33.png?w=782" tabindex="0" role="button" width="1024" height="484" src="https://rakujourney.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-09-08-at-09.55.33.png?w=1024" alt=""><figcaption><a href="https://picocss.com/docs/nav">https://picocss.com/docs/nav</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>So for our goals, it looks like Pico CSS is on a good track. Their website says:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1268" data-permalink="https://rakujourney.wordpress.com/2024/09/08/htmx-raku-and-pico-css/screenshot-2024-09-08-at-09-57-28/" data-orig-file="https://rakujourney.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-09-08-at-09.57.28.png" data-orig-size="1556,746" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screenshot 2024-09-08 at 09.57.28" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://rakujourney.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-09-08-at-09.57.28.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://rakujourney.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-09-08-at-09.57.28.png?w=782" tabindex="0" role="button" width="1024" height="490" src="https://rakujourney.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/screenshot-2024-09-08-at-09.57.28.png?w=1024" alt=""></figure>



<p>What’s that?</p>



<h2>Semantic HTML!</h2>



<p>Looks like my goal all along has been <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/semantic-html5-guide/#">Semantic HTML</a> (not that I knew at the time).</p>



<blockquote>
<p>By adding semantic HTML tags to your pages, you provide additional information that helps define the roles and relative importance of the different parts of your page.</p>



<p>(As opposed to non-semantic HTML, which uses tags that don’t directly convey meaning.)</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So having more powerful <em>Semantic</em> HTML is a win.</p>



<figure><img src="https://static.semrush.com/blog/uploads/media/cc/85/cc85d452a743e27f68d426df35e4da7d/EN-Semantic-Search-Non-Semantic.webp" alt=""></figure>



<p>Hopefully the figure above is enough of an eye opener for now. There’s much more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML">info</a> out there if you are curious. But obviously read the rest of my post first.</p>



<p><em>[For hardcore aficionados, I plan to look into Web Components in a future post. I also think that Bootstrap and Tailwind and SASS in general are good companions to HTMX and Raku — but my project and this series of posts <strong>starts</strong> by using Pico CSS to minimize the cognitive load on the style side – later we will come back to these other styling tools].</em></p>



<h2>Real Code</h2>



<p>So lets see how this looks in action. All the code for these posts is on <a href="https://github.com/librasteve/raku-HTMX-Examples">GitHub</a> for your perusal and collaboration.</p>



<p>I have been using Pico CSS as part of my project to rebuild the HTMX <a href="https://htmx.org/examples/">examples</a> for Raku / Cro largely by translating the Python / Flask <a href="https://github.com/Konfuzian/htmx-examples-with-flask/tree/main">examples</a>. This post draws on the <a href="https://htmx.org/examples/tabs-hateoas/">Tabs HATEOAS</a> one in particular, since I have in mind that I will want a Tab Component in my toolbag but that Pico CSS does not provide one out of the box. Pico does have <a href="https://picocss.com/docs/accordion">Accordions</a> so there is some prior art for inspiration.</p>



<p>Anywho, here’s the way the final code ended up.</p>



<p>tabs/index.crotmp:</p>


<div><pre title="">&lt;nav&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href="#" hx-get="/tabs/tab1" hx-target="#tab"&gt;Tab 1&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href="#" hx-get="/tabs/tab2" hx-target="#tab"&gt;Tab 2&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href="#" hx-get="/tabs/tab3" hx-target="#tab"&gt;Tab 3&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;div id="tab" hx-get="/tabs/tab1" hx-trigger="load"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>/tabs/tab1.crotmp (tab2 and tab 3 are much the same so I won’t bore you)</p>


<div><pre title="">&lt;section&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      "When you're new to something, you bring an ignorance that can
      be highly innovative."
      &lt;footer&gt;
        &lt;cite&gt;– Rick Rubin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>/Routes/Examples/Tabs.rakumod to fulfil the <code>hx-get</code> attrs.</p>


<div><pre title="">use Cro::HTTP::Router;
use Cro::WebApp::Template;

sub tabs-routes() is export {

    route {
        template-location 'templates/tabs';

        get -&gt; {
            template 'index.crotmp';
        }

        get -&gt; 'tab1' {
            template 'tab1.crotmp';
        }

        get -&gt; 'tab2' {
            template 'tab2.crotmp';
        }

        get -&gt; 'tab3' {
            template 'tab3.crotmp';
        }
    }
}
</pre></div>


<p>And the proof… oh yeah, Pico has built in dark mode 😉</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>setkeys</code> This option determines what keys are used to decide if two objects 'match'.

        The Internet Archive Loses Appeal. As Expected.    </p><div>
        <p dir="ltr">The United States Court of Appeals (Second Circuit) just issued a ruling against the Internet Archive (Archive.org) -- rejecting their appeal, and upholding a previous ruling against them in the<a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5016077/the-internet-archives-digital-lending-puts-the-entire-service-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Hachette vs Internet Archive</a> legal battle.</p><p>Make no mistake: This is very bad news for both the Internet Archive, Archive.org users, as well as other archival projects.</p><p><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2024-09-05/102127/102127_nexkj7fbyd1uvxr_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="483" height="348"></p><h3>Hachette v. Internet Archive: The Short, Short Version</h3><p dir="ltr">To make sure everyone is up to speed, here is the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X4HYA-lB-U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> short, short version</a> of this legal battle.</p><p dir="ltr">For many years, the Internet Archive has been creating digital copies of physical books (by scanning them) -- then allowing people to "borrow" those digital versions from Archive.org (in theory limiting the total digital books being "lent out" to the count of the physical books in the Archive's possession).</p><p dir="ltr">They never obtained permissions from the authors or publishers to do any of this.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2020, during the Covid lockdowns, the Internet Archive launched the "National Emergency Library" -- where they removed that "1 physical book : 1 digital book lent out" restriction.&nbsp; Meaning anybody on the Internet could obtain digital scans of physical books... and the Archive could "Lend Out" an unlimited number of digital copies based on a single physical copy.</p><p dir="ltr">Again.&nbsp; No permission was obtained from the writers or publishers.</p><p dir="ltr">Thus -- to the surprise of absolutely nobody -- the "<a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5016077/the-internet-archives-digital-lending-puts-the-entire-service-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hachette v. Internet Archive</a>" legal battle began.</p><p dir="ltr">And... The Internet Archive lost.&nbsp; The judge<a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5016077/the-internet-archives-digital-lending-puts-the-entire-service-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> ruled in favor of the publishers</a> (including Hachette, Wiley, Penguin Random House, &amp; HarperCollins).</p><p>Naturally, Internet Archive appealed that ruling.&nbsp; But, boy-howdy, was their appeal a strange one which was destined to fail.</p><h3>The Strange Appeal of The Internet Archive</h3><p dir="ltr">On April 19th of 2024, the<a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5556650/the-internet-archives-last-ditch-effort-to-save-itself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Internet Archive filed their final brief</a> in their attempt to appeal this ruling against them.</p><p dir="ltr">In that ruling, one of the Internet Archive's core arguments was that it cost the Internet Archive a lot of money to make so many digital copies of books without permission... so, therefore, the Internet Archive should be allowed to do it.</p><p dir="ltr">That is neither a joke nor an exaggeration.&nbsp; It sounds weird, because it is weird.</p><p dir="ltr">The Internet Archive truly attempted to make the case that spending a lot of money committing a crime... should make that crime legal.&nbsp; (Could you imagine the mafia making that case?&nbsp; Wild.)</p><p dir="ltr">You can<a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5556650/the-internet-archives-last-ditch-effort-to-save-itself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> read the full analysis</a>, by The Lunduke Journal, of the appeal (including the appeal itself) for yourself for more details.</p><p dir="ltr">The reality is... there was never any chance that the Internet Archive's attempted appeal was going to be successful.&nbsp; Their defensive arguments were highly illogical (bordering on flights of fancy), and brought nothing new or noteworthy to the case.&nbsp; This was all painfully obvious.</p><h3>The Lost Appeal</h3><p dir="ltr">On Wednesday, September 4th, 2024, the opinion was handed down from the United States Court of Appeals.</p><p dir="ltr">While the full ruling is roughly 64 pages long, this single paragraph -- from the second page -- summarizes things quite well:</p><blockquote><p>"This appeal presents the following question: <strong>Is it “fair use”</strong> for a nonprofit organization <strong>to scan copyright-protected print books in their entirety, and distribute those digital copies online, in full, for free</strong>, subject to a one-to-one owned-to-loaned ratio between its print copies and the digital copies it makes available at any given time, <strong>all without authorization from the copyright-holding publishers or authors?</strong> Applying the relevant provisions of the Copyright Act as well as binding Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedent, <strong>we conclude the answer is no</strong>. We therefore AFFIRM."</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">To call out the truly important parts:</p><p dir="ltr">"Question: Is it 'fair use' ... to scan copyright-protected print books in their entirety, and distribute those digital copies online, in full, for free ... all without authorization from the copyright-holding publishers or authors? ... we conclude the answer is no."</p><p dir="ltr">You can<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca2.60988/gov.uscourts.ca2.60988.306.1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> read the entire 64 page ruling</a> for yourself.&nbsp; Heck.&nbsp; You can<a href="https://archive.org/details/hachette-internet-archive-appellate-opinion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> even read it on Archive.org</a>.&nbsp; But that line, right there, sums it all up.</p><p>Naturally, the Internet Archive<a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/09/04/internet-archive-responds-to-appellate-opinion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> has issued a statement</a>.&nbsp; Albeit... a short one.</p><blockquote><p>"<strong>We are disappointed in today’s opinion</strong> about the Internet Archive’s digital lending of books that are available electronically elsewhere. We are reviewing the court’s opinion and will continue to defend the rights of libraries to own, lend, and preserve books."</p></blockquote><h3>What Happens Now?</h3><p dir="ltr">The Internet Archive gets sued by some of the biggest book publishers... and loses.</p><p dir="ltr">The Internet Archive appeals... and loses.</p><p dir="ltr">What happens next?&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; Unfortunately -- for both the Internet Archive, and its users -- the future looks rather bleak.</p><p dir="ltr">First and foremost: Has the Internet Archive made, and distributed, digital copies of work you own?&nbsp; This ruling will certainly not hurt your case should you decide to take legal action against Archive.org.</p><p dir="ltr">And -- holy smokes -- the amount of copyrighted material on Archive.org is absolutely massive.</p><p dir="ltr">The<a href="https://archive.org/details/software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Archive.org software repository</a> alone contains millions of items.&nbsp; With a very large number of them being copyrighted material, posted there without permission of the copyright owner.</p><p dir="ltr">Simply going by the numbers, here's how much material is available on Archive.org (roughly):</p><ul><li>832 Billion archived webpages.</li><li>38 Million printed materials (magazines, books, etc.).</li><li>2.6 Million pieces of software</li><li>11.6 Million videos files.</li><li>15 Million audio files.</li><li>4.7 Million images.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">How many of those items do you think are there without permission (or possibly even knowledge) of the owners or creators?</p><p dir="ltr">Every single one now has an increasingly strong case when looking at potential legal action.</p><p dir="ltr">And it's about to get even worse for the Internet Archive.</p><h3>UMG Recordings v. Internet Archive</h3><p dir="ltr">That's right, the book publishers weren't the only ones taking legal action against Archive.org.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Universal Music Group and Sony have<a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/jnpwwwejopw/INTERNET%20ARCHVIE%20RECORD%20LABELS%20LAWSUIT%20complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> an ongoing lawsuit against the Internet Archive</a> -- regarding the distribution of 2,749 audio recordings (with potential damages upwards of $412 Million USD).</p><p dir="ltr">Seriously.</p><blockquote><p>"Plaintiffs bring this suit to address Defendants’ <strong>massive ongoing violation</strong> of Plaintiffs’ rights in protected pre-1972 sound recordings. As part of what Defendants have dubbed the “Great 78 Project,” Internet Archive, Blood, and GBLP have <strong>willfully reproduced thousands of Plaintiffs’ protected sound recordings without authorization by copying physical records into digital files. Internet Archive then willfully uploaded, distributed, and digitally transmitted those illegally copied sound recordings millions of times from Internet Archive’s website</strong>."</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Sound familiar?&nbsp; Digital copies.&nbsp; No permission from the artists or publishers.&nbsp; Free downloads for everyone.</p><p>Naturally, the Internet Archive attempted to have this suit dismissed... but<a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/zdpxxyqrepx/INTERNET%20ARCHIVE%20RECORD%20LABELS%20LAWSUIT%20mtd.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> their attempt was denied</a> in May of 2024.&nbsp; (Because if there's one constant in life... it's that the Internet Archive always loses in court.)&nbsp; That case is going forward.</p><p><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2024-09-05/102127/102127_lni79378fyrnosk_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="536" height="204"></p><p dir="ltr">What happens if the Internet Archive loses this UMG / Sony case?&nbsp; What happens if they are ordered to pay $412 Million in damages?</p><p dir="ltr">To put it simply: Archive.org doesn't have that kind of money.&nbsp; They bring in roughly $20 Million (give or take) per year.&nbsp; That type of legal liability would absolutely destroy the Internet Archive.</p><p><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2024-09-05/102127/102127_wwmuc3m8nhgibvl_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="548" height="171"></p><p dir="ltr">And, here's the thing, the Internet Archive is almost assuredly going to lose that lawsuit as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of what you, I, or anyone else thinks of the Internet Archive -- and, make no mistake, I use that service several times a week (and love it) -- the law here is incredibly clear and well tested.</p><p dir="ltr">The Internet Archive runs one of the largest (if not the largest) website of pirated and stolen digital material on the planet.&nbsp; Sure, it may also provide extremely valuable (and often, very legal) services as well.. but that doesn't make those crimes go away.</p><p dir="ltr">With each legal defeat, the Internet Archive grows increasingly vulnerable to additional attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">Simply being logical about it... it seems highly likely that we'll see additional suits brought against the Internet Archive in the months ahead.&nbsp; Books, music, TV shows, software... Archive.org contains a massive mountain of copyrighted material in all areas.&nbsp; These are suits which the Internet Archive would be almost certain to lose.</p><p dir="ltr">With this reality looming, how long until Archive.org will be forced to shut down entirely?&nbsp; That day is likely not far off... and a sad day it will be.</p><h3 dir="ltr">The Archive Had to Know This Was Coming</h3><p dir="ltr">The truly sad part?&nbsp; The leadership of the Internet Archive had to know exactly what they were doing.</p><p dir="ltr">Every step of the way, it was obvious that they were going to lock horns with publishers (and lose).</p><p dir="ltr">Heck, I<a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5016077/the-internet-archives-digital-lending-puts-the-entire-service-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> told them</a>. <a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5556650/the-internet-archives-last-ditch-effort-to-save-itself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Repeatedly</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">But, even if The Lunduke Journal hadn't pointed this out... it was a brutally obvious certainty to anyone even mildly familiar with copyright law and the workings of Archive.org.</p><p dir="ltr">Which means: The Internet Archive knowingly put their entire service at risk (including the Wayback Machine, the massive archive or pre-copyright audio recordings, etc.) because they wanted to publish copyrighted material against the wishes of the authors or publishers.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite this, they continue to push a public perception campaign where they pretend that publishers and authors are burning their own books.&nbsp; When the reality is... the books are still available a wide variety of ways.&nbsp; Archive.org simply got in trouble for copying and distributing them without permission.</p><p><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2024-09-05/102127/102127_cjj1eu9eameysfk_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="573" height="203"></p><p dir="ltr">Something I find truly fascinating about all of this, is that The Lunduke Journal will -- as usual -- get yelled at (rather extensively) for this article.&nbsp; For simply pointing out the current reality of copyright law and how the Internet Archive has, knowingly, violated it.</p><p dir="ltr">People love Archive.org.&nbsp; Heck, I love Archive.org.</p><p dir="ltr">And people are allowing their love for that website to convince them that anyone being critical of it... must, necessarily, be bad and evil.&nbsp; An enemy.</p><p dir="ltr">But it is not The Lunduke Journal who is putting The Internet Archive in danger of being shut down.</p><p dir="ltr">Neither is it Sony, Hachette, Random House, or HarperCollins who are putting The Internet Archive in danger.</p><p dir="ltr">No, sir.</p><p dir="ltr">The only one putting The Internet Archive in danger... is The Internet Archive.</p><div>
