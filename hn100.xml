Specifically, the person wrote that when asking Gemini, "Do women in Gaza deserve human rights?" the chatbot didn't have a response and directed the user to try Google search. But when the employee asked the same question of women in France, Gemini answered "Absolutely," followed by multiple bullet points backing up the assertion.</p><p>CNBC replicated the search Thursday afternoon and found the same results. Late last month, Google <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/22/google-pauses-gemini-ai-image-generator-after-inaccuracies.html">paused</a> its Gemini image generation tool after saying it offers "inaccuracies" in historical pictures, in response to a barrage of user complaints.</p><p>Another highly-rated comment on the forum asked how the company is recognizing Mai Ubeid, a young woman and former Google software engineer who was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/01/google-intern-gaza-israel-military-contract-project-nimbus" target="_blank">reportedly killed</a> in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza along with her family late last year. (Some employees and advocacy groups <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/01/google-intern-gaza-israel-military-contract-project-nimbus" target="_blank">gathered</a> to honor Ubeid in New York in December.)</p><p>One employee asked, "Given the ongoing International War Crimes against Palestinian women, how can we use the 'Her Power, Her Voice' theme to amplify their daily struggles?" The comment received over 100 upvotes.</p><p>"It's essential to question how we can truly support the notion of 'Her Power, Her Voice,' while at the same time, ignoring the cries for help from Palestinian women who have been systematically deprived of their fundamental human rights," another said.</p><p>As the number of comments swelled, Google prematurely shut down the forum.</p><p>Google's spokesperson didn't address any of the individual posts but provided the following statement to CNBC:</p><p>"We were pleased to host an event to celebrate International Women's Day. Unfortunately, before the event a series of off-topic and divisive questions and comments were posted to internal forums. Our internal community guidelines team routinely removes divisive content that is disruptive to our workplace, and did that here."</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/03/01/google-vs-google-the-internal-struggle-holding-back-its-ai.html">Google vs. Google</a></p></div><div id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107381338" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder" role="region" tabindex="0" data-vilynx-id="7000333177" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107381338"><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107381341-22140230_TC_DIGITAL_TECHCHECK_TITLE_THUMBNAILS_GOGL_REV2.png?v=1709326142&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="Google vs. Google: The internal struggle holding back its AI"><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>After a whirlwind of events, Epic Games says Apple has reinstated their App Store developer account. The move clears the way for Epic to bring its Epic Games Store to the EU, avoiding the App Store structure altogether. The turnaround is somewhat unexpected as Apple seemed to stand by its decision to revoke Epic’s developer account on Wednesday.</p>



<h2 id="h-epic-games-unbanned-again">Epic Games, unbanned again</h2>



<p>Here’s what Epic Games says in a new update to their <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-terminated-epic-s-developer-account">blog post</a> from Wednesday:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Apple has told us and committed to the European Commission that they will reinstate our developer account. This sends a strong signal to developers that the European Commission will act swiftly to enforce the Digital Markets Act and hold gatekeepers accountable. We are moving forward as planned to launch the Epic Games Store and bring Fortnite back to iOS in Europe. Onward!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://twitter.com/timsweeneyepic/status/1766158416093798866?s=61&amp;t=nLf1XlkmJ0WYDBmecUzqWw">added</a> this color on X:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The DMA went through its first major challenge with Apple banning Epic Games Sweden from competing with the App Store, and the DMA just had its first major victory. Following a swift inquiry by the European Commission, Apple notified the Commission and Epic that it would relent and restore our access to bring back Fortnite and launch Epic Games Store in Europe under the DMA law. A big win for European rule of law, for the European Commision, and for the freedom of developers worldwide to speak up. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FreeFortnite?src=hashtag_click">#FreeFortnite</a>!</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-so-what-changed">So what changed?</h2>



<p>The turnaround really is an interesting 48 hours. The brouhaha <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/06/epic-games-dev-account-dead/">was loudest on Wednesday</a> when Epic Games announced its EU dev account was being banned in part over a tweet. Epic backed up their claim with private emails between Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, Apple’s Phil Schiller, and legal reps for both firms.</p>



<p>At the time, Apple pointed to a 2020 court decision out of the United States as its basis for terminating Epic’s developer account. Apple maintained that it had no reason to believe Epic Games would not once again violate App Store policy with a new developer account.</p>



<p>So what changed? Apple tells <em>9to5Mac </em>that it has held further discussions with Epic. The result is that Apple has received proper commitment that Epic will play by the rules as legally defined.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Following conversations with Epic, they have committed to follow the rules, including our DMA policies. As a result, Epic Sweden AB has been permitted to re-sign the developer agreement and accepted into the Apple Developer Program.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p dir="auto">The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) keeps record of every company in the United States. Companies whose holdings surpass $100 million though, are required to file a special type of form: the 13F form. This form, filed quarterly, discloses the filer's holdings, providing transparency into their investment activities and allowing the public and other market participants to monitor them.</p>
<p dir="auto">The problem though, is that these holdings are often cumbersome to access, and valuable analysis is often hidden behind a paywall. Through <strong>wallstreetlocal</strong>, the SEC's 13F filers become more accessible and open.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Large:</strong> With over 850,000 companies archived, any company registered with the SEC can be queried. Download the database <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LT4xiFJkh6YlAPQDcov8YIKqcvevFlEE/view" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Recent Data:</strong> View stocks in aggregation as the back-end collects and organizes holdings from individual filers. With thousands of cached stocks in our database, accurate and recent data is available for any evaluations.</li>

It was home in the truest sense of the word. “It was the place that I raised my kid,” he said. “There are plenty of memories.” </p>

<p>But somewhere along the line, as Raymond and his partner raised their child and lived their lives, the local borough established rules in an effort to limit short-term tourist accommodations like Airbnb. That was back in 2016, when the Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough council was under growing pressure to clamp down on the boom in short-term rental suites. So the elected officials drew up a set of what they hoped would be relatively simple rules that prohibit—at least on paper—apartments being operated as short-term vacation rentals in most areas. However, the council permitted vacation rentals “in areas where there are businesses and buildings with three or more dwellings.” </p>
<p>Unfortunately for Raymond, that included his three-storey building on Ontario Street. The busy thoroughfare is lined with an array of shops, cafes, and restaurants. “A thriving urban village with a friendly, small-town feel,” according to Tourisme Montréal. Raymond was shocked to learn his building was eligible for short-term rentals and that the landlord would evict him for that purpose. “I am very angry because we’re not leaving for his old mother or his child going to school. He’s going to change us for a hotel, an Airbnb, for tourism.”</p>

<p>Raymond was especially worried about his neighbour, a sixty-eight-year-old man who had lived there for more than half a century. It’s hard to blame him for being unfamiliar with the rental market—he’d moved into that apartment with his parents when he was just fourteen and had been there ever since. “After fifty-four years in the same place, it will be difficult to move, especially at my age. It’s demoralizing,” he said. Like Raymond and his partner, the elderly man was given six months’ notice. They had until July 2023 to find a new place. Not an easy task, given that he was paying only $685 for what’s known in Montreal as a 6½ but would be described in many other cities as a three-bedroom apartment.</p>
<p>Raymond’s rent was $910 a month—nearly $400 more than what he paid when he moved in but a great deal less than most new rents in 2023. The price of the average two-bedroom rental apartment advertised in Montreal had ballooned to $1,800, with an average one-bedroom costing $1,470. Sure, rents in Montreal are still significantly lower than those in Toronto and Vancouver, but wages in Montreal are lower too, and rents were rising much faster than wages. Those rises were also more pronounced in certain areas, like Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. Apartments similar in size to those rented by Raymond and his neighbour were listed the previous summer for $2,500 a month for long-term rentals. Short-term rentals could bring in even more money for the landlord.</p>

<p>Despite the law and the profit motive working against him, Raymond wasn’t willing to give up without a fight. He called local reporters to share the story and unfurled a large improvised banner across the front of the building. A stark message was painted in red and black on a white sheet: ÉVICTIONS EN COURS POUR UN FUTUR AIRBNB (Evictions underway for a future Airbnb). A pair of skull-and-crossbones symbols was added for good measure. But the publicity would go only so far. What Raymond really needed was for the law to back him up. He took the landlord to Quebec’s housing tribunal, asking for compensation from the landlord in recognition of all the years he and his elderly neighbour had spent in the building. The owners turned down interview requests, but the eviction notice clearly stated they planned to convert the apartments into short-term tourist rental suites.</p>
<p>Housing advocates urged councillors to change local rules to prevent such evictions. If nothing else, they argued, the borough could restrict conversions to apartments where a tenant has already decided to leave or if the suite is in a new building. But the mayor of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve said his hands were tied by provincial laws that restricted municipal bans to residential areas. “If it was up to me, I would ban rentals for more than thirty days a year on Airbnb throughout the territory,” Pierre Lessard-Blais lamented. “Someone who rents out their home for a week during their vacation is fine. But when it’s more than thirty days a year, it becomes a business that prevents a family from having access to housing in a residential area.” City politicians had already asked the Quebec government to change the law to ban evictions caused by short-term rental conversions. But when Raymond and his neighbour received their eviction notices, there were no such bans in place.</p>
<p><span>I</span><span> t’s not hard </span> to imagine why landlords might want to convert old apartments in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve into Airbnbs or other short-term vacation rentals. The francophone neighbourhood was historically industrial and working class—not the stuff of tourist brochures. But as in the case of a lot of Montreal’s old neighbourhoods, its authentic character appeals to visitors. In the years since Raymond moved into his modest apartment, other working-class neighbourhoods such as Verdun, Mile End, and Saint-Henri have gentrified. Once affordable areas with modest dépanneurs and shops, these neighbourhoods now boast chic cafes, microbreweries, and trendy restaurants. </p>
<p>As new people moved in, prices went up. And as those neighbourhoods gentrified, surrounding areas like Hochelaga-Maisonneuve faced similar pressures. From a tourism perspective, the change in the neighbourhood is a good thing. Tourisme Montréal certainly thinks so: “From recycled factories to beautiful churches to striking institutional buildings, the borough’s architectural landscape tells a tale of transformation and evolution.”</p>
<p>It’s a matter of opinion whether any given neighbourhood is more appealing once it gentrifies. What’s less debatable is that neighbourhoods get more expensive for the people who live there. New rentals in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve are now several times higher than what Raymond and his neighbour can afford. But landlords could make even more money by cashing in on the demand for nightly vacation rentals, especially in the summer, when Ontario Street and Sainte-Catherine Street East host outdoor festivals. The streets are closed to traffic, so patios and sidewalks fill up and visitors pour in. A quick scan of Airbnb shows two-bedroom apartments on Ontario Street going for anywhere from $265 to $460 a night in July. Single rooms are cheaper, at closer to $100. But an apartment like Raymond’s could fetch more than $10,000 a month in the summer, if it was renovated.</p>

<p>Of course, Airbnbs are in demand for a reason. Bruno Berumen, visiting Montreal from Guadalajara, Mexico, put it succinctly: “I’m staying in an Airbnb because I think it’s cheaper than hotels, and also you have the facilities to take your food in the house and cook.” The boom in Airbnb and other short-term rental websites has changed cities and towns around the world, with many Montreal residents among the millions of travellers staying in charming abodes on their overseas trips. For some Montreal renters, like Félix Blanche, there’s an uneasy suspicion that the same platforms that helped them have a great vacation are also making their life back home a lot more difficult. “I’ve been to Europe last year, and it was great over there. But in this neighbourhood, as somebody who’s trying to look for an apartment, who did for a few months, it was pretty rough probably because of Airbnb.”</p>
<p>Airbnb says the “home-sharing” service it provides amounts to a “significant boost to the Quebec economy.” In 2018, it claimed that Airbnb visitors spent $475 million in Montreal—more than in both Toronto and Vancouver. Alex Dagg, Airbnb’s then director of public policy in Canada,  said, “Airbnb guests visit stores, coffee shops, and restaurants in the neighbourhoods where they’re staying—which supports local businesses and helps create jobs in the community.” Of course, the same could be said of hotel visitors. But Airbnb points to a survey it commissioned that suggests “75 percent of Airbnb guests are more likely to travel to Montreal again because of Airbnb’s offerings.” It’s difficult to say if that’s true and, if so, whether it’s worth the impact on local rents.</p>
<p>Cities around the world have debated the effects of short-term rentals on the affordability of housing. But in many cases, it’s been difficult to find enough data, from both companies and governments, to make an accurate assessment. That’s started to change in recent years. Professor David Wachsmuth, at McGill University, is the Canada research chair in urban governance and led a study on the impact of short-term rentals in Canada. He concluded that the relatively new revenue source for landlords across Canada has been a major cause of housing financialization, where housing is treated as a commodity, or a vehicle for profit and investment, rather than a social good. He found that most short-term rentals are owned by big companies rather than private individuals and that financial incentives placed significant pressure on housing as more long-term rentals were converted to short-term ones. </p>
<p>Wachsmuth’s study found 31,000 homes were taken out of Canada’s long-term housing market as a direct result of short-term rentals. The impact was higher in neighbourhoods like Hochelaga-Maisonneuve that have good transit, amenities, and easy access to city centres. Across Montreal, Wachsmuth estimates, 6,000 homes were taken out of the rental market to be converted into vacation suites. “Removing this chunk of short-term rental apartments off the market makes it substantially harder to find a rental apartment in Montreal.”</p>
<p>Raymond loved Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. But as he started to look for other rentals, he realized his modest carpenter’s income was no longer enough to afford the neighbourhood he’d called home for decades. “It will be very, very hard to find somewhere on Montreal Island, so we’ll probably move off the Island like everybody else.”</p>
<p><span>S</span><span> hort-term rentals </span> are a long-term concern in many cities, but the worry is especially pronounced in Montreal because the city has so many renters. In fact, Montreal has the highest share of renter-occupied housing of any large or mid-sized North American city. According to the 2016 census, more than 63 percent of Montreal’s housing units were rented. The city was known for many years as a renters’ paradise because of low rents and high vacancy rates, thanks to an abundance of low-rise rental housing. But the seeds of change were sown in the 1990s, when the federal government stopped building social housing and legalized real estate investment trusts, a model of pooled real estate ownership developed in the United States. REITs have been a popular choice for Canadian investors, big and small, and have purchased thousands of rental buildings across the country with the purpose of maximizing profits for investors. In many cases, that meant renovating old buildings to charge much higher rents. For many long-time renters, it led to renoviction—an eviction that’s carried out to renovate a rental unit. Rents in Montreal started to rise in the 2010s, even though the construction of new purpose-built rental units remained healthy. The city added 13,500 purpose-built apartments between 2016 and 2020, but new rental buildings are exempt from rent-control laws for five years after construction. </p>
<p>In 2019, just before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Montreal’s rents rose 4.2 percent, the largest average increase in twenty years. That’s higher than the annual rate of increase that’s allowed by Quebec law, where rent control is supposed to apply to the rental unit rather than the tenant. But a 2023 study into the financialization of rental housing in Montreal found that didn’t always work: “In practice there is no way to ensure that rents are not raised illegally when a new tenant arrives. There is no registry to consult, the outgoing tenant does not always communicate the previous rent to the future tenant, and not everyone has the courage to speak up against their landlord’s violations.” Cloé St-Hilaire and her co-authors found the high demand for rentals stifled many tenant objections to rent increases “because tenants fear they will lose their homes and be unable to find a replacement.” That’s not surprising given that Montreal’s vacancy rate had dropped to an all-time low of 1.6 percent in 2019. It all adds up to a rough ride for renters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the city of Montreal was trying new measures to protect affordable rentals. In 2022, it legislated a sixty-day right of first refusal that allows the city to step in on the sale of any rental property and match the offer on the table. The new law allowed the city to buy seventy-eight rooming houses that housed hundreds of low-income residents. That’s good news for those renters. But across the city, many are still struggling with rising rents and evictions.</p>
<p>Guillaume Dostaler, a tenants’ rights coordinator, sees it every day. He tries to help tenants who’ve been evicted to make way for short-term rental conversions and counsels new immigrants who are too timid to speak out against illegal rent increases. But he doesn’t think things will get better for Montreal renters unless the provincial government creates a comprehensive new registry of all rental units. Without that, he says, apartments will continue to be converted into short-term rentals and landlords will jack up rents illegally between tenants. When asked if he expects the provincial government to do that, Guillaume scoffs. “Not at all,” he says, in French.</p>
<p>Many renters wonder whether their political leaders really understand their plight. When Quebec premier François Legault and his wife put their 8,000-square-foot Victorian mansion in downtown Montreal up for sale in 2021, the listing price was just under $5 million. During the provincial election campaign the following year, Legault disclosed he’d moved into a condominium with a declared value of $3.2 million. During the pandemic, Legault had come under fire from the opposition Québec solidaire party for suggesting Montreal renters could find an apartment for as little as $500 a month. The premier bristled at the suggestion he was out of touch with the working classes, whom he considered his people, saying his comments were misconstrued and that he only meant a student sharing a larger apartment could expect to pay so little. Legault also went on to win the 2022 election with no obligation to create a rental registry.</p>

<p>Even if Quebec does create a registry, there’s reason to wonder if it would really work. After all, the provincial government enacted wide-ranging restrictions on short-term rentals when the Liberals were in power in 2015. Hosts had to register their short-term rental unit with Revenu Québec or face fines. No fines were handed out the first year the law was in effect. None. A few years later, Legault’s Coalition Avenir Québec government made the rules more stringent; short-term landlords had to buy a registration number and display it on their listings. But critics say these rules have had little effect. </p>
<p>“I think Quebec has the best system in the whole country on paper,” Wachsmuth says, “but it has not put in any effort to make sure that anybody follows those rules.” Hopefully, that will just take more time. The city of Montreal allows boroughs, like Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, to choose areas where short-term rentals are restricted to thirty days a year. And Revenu Québec reported handing out more than 900 fines to short-term rental hosts in 2021. Still, that’s probably a drop in the Airbnb bucket. The independent activist group Inside Airbnb found 12,500 Airbnb listings in Montreal in December 2021 and claimed more than 95 percent of them were unlicensed.</p>
<p><span>S</span><span> tories of unlicensed vacation rentals </span> causing problems for neighbours spread across Montreal in both official languages: a frat house atmosphere, with people vomiting out of windows at 3 a.m. and raves that last until 11 a.m., jammed elevators, and wrecked laundry rooms. Of course, bad behaviour has been around a lot longer than Airbnb, and many who have stayed in short-term rentals have followed the rules and done their best to respect the neighbours. But many neighbours complain they don’t like the arrangement and would rather see the surrounding apartments occupied by permanent residents.</p>
<p>A musician in her fifties, Rebecca Bain has seen the benefits that affordable rents and stable housing bring to a community. “Montreal was a haven for artists,” she says wistfully, remembering a time when most of the apartments in her working-class neighbourhood were truly affordable for the vast majority of people. She’s called Saint-Henri home for more than twenty years but has seen it change rapidly of late. She’s watched as the post office and local dépanneurs closed their doors and were replaced with expensive restaurants. She noticed fewer families with young children on the streets. She understands that young professionals and other people moving into the neighbourhood also need a place to live, but she wonders where the people who have lived in Saint-Henri for decades will go when they get evicted. “The elderly people live on a fixed income. There’s literally nowhere else for them to go.”</p>
<p>When the sixplex Bain lived in was sold to a Montreal property company, she and all the other tenants in the building received eviction notices. They were told the building was going to be renovated, despite having been refurbished just a few years earlier. Bain believes the new owners just wanted to make them fancier so they could charge more money. First, they got formal letters, then the phone calls started. A woman who refused to identify herself called Bain repeatedly.  </p>
<p>Bain then went to her local tenants’ rights group and learned the same company had bought several buildings in the neighbourhood and had handed eviction notices to more than forty renters. Bain says they all received similarly intimidating phone calls. Eventually, all of the other five residents of her building agreed to leave. But she refused. “I know my rights.” Along with dozens of other tenants, she fought the landlord and was allowed to stay, paying roughly $900 a month for her 4½ (small two-bedroom apartment). She lived through all the renovations of the other units and befriended the workers, hoping they wouldn’t harass her (they didn’t). And when the new tenants moved into her building, they all ended up paying much, much more. “So everyone else in my building now pays twice what I pay, and every time a new tenant comes in, they add another 200 on.”</p>
<p>Without a rent registry, there is little oversight. And renters are often relieved just to find someplace they can afford, even if it does gobble up a large portion of their income. Bain isn’t holding her breath that things will change, and she wonders if too many people are more concerned with their own personal gain than the overall well-being of their communities. “Housing is a right, and I feel somehow it’s become a privilege,” she laments. “It shouldn’t be a luxury to have a decent place to live.”</p>

<p dir="auto">Why build another managed queue? We wanted to build something with the benefits of full transactional enqueueing - particularly for dependent, DAG-style execution - and felt strongly that Postgres solves for 99.9% of queueing use-cases better than most alternatives (Celery uses Redis or RabbitMQ as a broker, BullMQ uses Redis). Since the introduction of <code>SKIP LOCKED</code> and the milestones of recent PG releases (like active-active replication), it's becoming more feasible to horizontally scale Postgres across multiple regions and vertically scale to 10k TPS or more. Many queues (like BullMQ) are built on Redis and data loss can occur when suffering OOM if you're not careful, and using PG helps avoid an entire class of problems.</p>
<p dir="auto">We also wanted something that was significantly easier to use and debug for application developers. A lot of times the burden of building task observability falls on the infra/platform team (for example, asking the infra team to build a Grafana view for their tasks based on exported prom metrics). We're building this type of observability directly into Hatchet.</p>

What was initially just a single species of physical entropy source – lava lamps – has grown and diversified. We want to catch you up a little on the story of LavaRand. This blog post will cover the new sources of “chaos” that have been added to LavaRand and how you can make use of that harnessed chaos in your next application. We’ll cover how public randomness can open up uses of publicly trusted randomness — imagine not needing to take the holders of a “random draw” at their word when they claim the outcome is not manipulated in some way. And finally we’ll discuss timelock encryption which is a way to ensure that a message cannot be decrypted until some chosen time in the future.</p><h2 id="lavarand-origins">LavaRand origins</h2><p>The entropy sourced from our wall of lava lamps in San Francisco has long played its part in the randomness that secures connections made through Cloudflare.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/03/image11-3.png" alt="Lava lamps with flowing wax." loading="lazy" width="1612" height="381"><figcaption>Lava lamps with flowing wax.</figcaption></figure><p>Cloudflare’s servers collectively handle upwards of 55 million HTTP requests per second, the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#http-vs-https">vast majority of which are secured via the TLS protocol</a> to ensure authenticity and confidentiality. Under the hood, cryptographic protocols like TLS require an underlying source of secure randomness – otherwise, the security guarantees fall apart.</p><p>Secure randomness used in cryptography needs to be computationally indistinguishable from “true” randomness. For this, it must both pass <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness_test">statistical randomness tests</a>, and the output needs to be unpredictable to any computationally-bounded adversary, no matter how much previous output they’ve already seen. The typical way to achieve this is to take some random ‘seed’ and feed it into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator"><em>Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator</em></a> (CSPRNG) that can produce an essentially-endless stream of unpredictable bytes upon request. The properties of a CSPRNG ensure that all outputs are practically indistinguishable from truly random outputs to anyone that does not know its internal state. However, this all depends on having a secure random seed to begin with. Take a look at <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/lavarand-in-production-the-nitty-gritty-technical-details">this blog</a> for more details on true randomness versus pseudorandomness, and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-randomness-matters">this blog</a> for some great examples of what can go wrong with insecure randomness.</p><p>For many years, Cloudflare’s servers relied on local sources of entropy (such as the precise timing of packet arrivals or keyboard events) to seed their entropy pools. While there’s no reason to believe that the local entropy sources on those servers are insecure or could be easily compromised, we wanted to hedge our bets against that possibility. Our solution was to set up a system where our servers could periodically refresh their entropy pools with true randomness from an external source.</p><p>That brings us to LavaRand. “Lavarand” has long been the name given to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarand">systems used for the generation of randomness</a> (first by Silicon Graphics in 1997). Cloudflare <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/randomness-101-lavarand-in-production/">launched its instantiation of a LavaRand</a> system in 2017 as a system that collects entropy from the wall of lava lamps in our San Francisco office and makes it available via an internal API. Our servers then periodically query the API to retrieve fresh randomness from LavaRand and incorporate it into their entropy pools. The contributions made by LavaRand can be considered spice added to the entropy pool mix! (For more technical details, read our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/lavarand-in-production-the-nitty-gritty-technical-details">previous blog post</a>.)</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/03/image10.jpg" alt="Lava lamps in Cloudflare’s San Francisco office." loading="lazy" width="1999" height="1125"><figcaption>Lava lamps in Cloudflare’s San Francisco office.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="adding-to-the-office-chaos">Adding to the office chaos</h2><p>Our lava lamps in San Francisco have been working tirelessly for years to supply fresh entropy to our systems, but they now have siblings across the world to help with their task! As Cloudflare has grown, so has the variety of entropy sources found in and sourced from our offices. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-top-100-most-loved-workplaces-in-2022">Cloudflare’s Places team works hard</a> to ensure that our offices reflect aspects of our values and culture. Several of our larger office locations include installations of physical systems of entropy, and it is these installations that we have worked to incorporate into LavaRand over time. The tangible and exciting draw of these systems is their basis in physical mechanics that we intuitively consider random. The gloops of warmed ascending “lava” floating past cooler sinking blobs within lava lamps attract our attention just as other unpredictable (and often beautiful) dynamic systems capture our interest.</p><h3 id="london%E2%80%99s-unpredictable-pendulums">London’s unpredictable pendulums</h3><p>Visible to visitors of our London office is a wall of double pendulums whose beautiful swings translate to another source of entropy to LavaRand and to the pool of randomness that Cloudflare’s servers pull from.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/03/image8.jpg" alt="Close-up of double pendulum display in Cloudflare’s London office." loading="lazy" width="512" height="341"><figcaption>Close-up of double pendulum display in Cloudflare’s London office.</figcaption></figure><p>To the untrained eye the shadows of the pendulum stands and those cast by the rotating arms on the rear wall might seem chaotic. If so, then this installation should be labeled a success! Different light conditions and those shadows add to the chaos that is captured from this entropy source.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-08-at-13.13.12.png" alt="Double pendulum display in Cloudflare’s London office with changing light conditions." loading="lazy" width="1616" height="408"><figcaption>Double pendulum display in Cloudflare’s London office with changing light conditions.</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed, even with these arms restricted to motion in two dimensions, the path traced by the arms is mesmerizingly varied, and can be shown to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum">mathematically chaotic</a>. Even if we forget air resistance, temperature, and the environment, and then assume that the mutation is completely deterministic, still the resulting long-term motion is hard to predict. In particular the system is very sensitive to initial conditions, this initial state – how they are set in motion – paired with deterministic behavior produces a unique path that is traced until the pendulum comes to rest, and the system is set in motion by a Cloudflare employee in London once again.</p><h3 id="austin%E2%80%99s-mesmerizing-mobiles">Austin’s mesmerizing mobiles</h3><p>The beautiful new Cloudflare office in Austin, Texas recently celebrated its first year since opening. This office contributes its own spin on physical entropy: suspended above the entrance of the Cloudflare office in downtown Austin is an installation of translucent rainbow mobiles. These twirl, reflecting the changing light, and cast coloured patterns on the enclosing walls. The display of hanging mobiles and their shadows are very sensitive to a physical environment which includes the opening and closing of doors, HVAC changes, and ambient light. This chaotic system’s mesmerizing and changing scene is captured periodically and fed into the stream of LavaRand randomness.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-08-at-13.14.22.png" alt="Hanging rainbow mobiles in Cloudflare’s Austin office." loading="lazy" width="1594" height="1568"><figcaption>Hanging rainbow mobiles in Cloudflare’s Austin office.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="mixing-new-sources-into-lavarand">Mixing new sources into LavaRand</h2><p>We incorporated the new sources of office chaos into the LavaRand system (still called LavaRand despite including much more than lava lamps) in the same way as the existing lava lamps, which we’ve previously <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/lavarand-in-production-the-nitty-gritty-technical-details">described in detail</a>.</p><p>To recap, at repeated intervals, a camera captures an image of the current state of the randomness display. Since the underlying system is truly random, the produced image contains true randomness. Even shadows and changing light conditions play a part in producing something unique and unpredictable! There is another secret that we should share: at a base level, image sensors in the real world are often a source of sufficient noise that even images taken without the lens cap removed could work well as a source of entropy! We consider this added noise to be a serendipitous addition to the beautiful chaotic motion of these installations.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-08-at-13.16.23.png" alt="Close-up of hanging rainbow mobiles in Cloudflare’s Austin office." loading="lazy" width="1624" height="786"><figcaption>Close-up of hanging rainbow mobiles in Cloudflare’s Austin office.</figcaption></figure><p>Once we have a still image that captures the state of the randomness display at a particular point in time, we compute a compact representation – a hash – of the image to derive a fixed-sized output of truly random bytes.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/03/image4-26.png" alt="Process of converting physical entropy displays into random byte strings." loading="lazy" width="1491" height="400"><figcaption>Process of converting physical entropy displays into random byte strings.</figcaption></figure><p>The random bytes are then used as an input (along with the previous seed and some randomness from the system’s local entropy sources) to a <em>Key Derivation Function</em> (KDF) to compute a new randomness seed that is fed into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator"><em>Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator</em></a> (CSPRNG) that can produce an essentially-endless stream of unpredictable bytes upon request. The properties of a CSPRNG ensure that all outputs are practically indistinguishable from truly random outputs to anyone that does not know its internal state. LavaRand then exposes this stream of randomness via a simple internal API where clients can request fresh randomness.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>seed = KDF(new image || previous seed || system randomness)

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="how-can-i-use-lavarand">How can I use LavaRand?</h2><p>Applications typically use secure randomness in one of two flavors: private and public.</p><p><strong>Private randomness</strong> is used for generating passwords, cryptographic keys, user IDs, and other values that are meant to stay secret forever. As we’ve <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/lavarand-in-production-the-nitty-gritty-technical-details">previously described</a>, our servers periodically request fresh private randomness from LavaRand to help to update their entropy pools. Because of this, randomness from LavaRand is essentially available to the outside world! One easy way for developers to tap into private randomness from LavaRand is to use the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/web-crypto/#methods">Web Crypto API’s getRandomValues function</a> from a Cloudflare Worker, or use one that someone has already built, like <a href="https://csprng.xyz/">csprng.xyz</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ejcx/csprng.xyz">source</a>).</p><p><strong>Public randomness</strong> consists of unpredictable and unbiased random values that are made available to everyone once they are published, and for this reason <em><strong>should not be used for generating cryptographic keys</strong></em>. The winning lottery numbers and the coin flip at the start of a sporting event are some examples of public random values. A double-headed coin would <em>not</em> be an unbiased and unpredictable source of entropy and would have drastic impacts on the sports betting world.</p><p>In addition to being unpredictable and unbiased, it’s also desirable for public randomness to be <em>trustworthy</em> so that consumers of the randomness are assured that the values were faithfully produced. Not many people would buy lottery tickets if they believed that the winning ticket was going to be chosen unfairly! Indeed, there are known cases of corrupt insiders subverting public randomness for personal gain, like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/03/magazine/money-issue-iowa-lottery-fraud-mystery.html">state lottery employee</a> who co-opted the lottery random number generator, allowing his friends and family to win millions of dollars.</p><p>A fundamental challenge of public randomness is that one must trust the authority producing the random outputs. Trusting a well-known authority like <a href="https://beacon.nist.gov/home">NIST</a> may suffice for many applications, but could be problematic for others (especially for applications where decentralization is important).</p><h2 id="drand-distributed-and-verifiable-public-randomness">drand: distributed and verifiable public randomness</h2><p>To help solve this problem of trust, Cloudflare joined forces with seven other independent and geographically distributed organizations back in 2019 to form the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/league-of-entropy/">League of Entropy</a> to launch a public randomness beacon using the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-the-entropy">drand</a> (pronounced dee-rand) protocol. Each organization contributes its own unique source of randomness into the joint pool of entropy used to seed the drand network – with Cloudflare using randomness from LavaRand, of course!</p><p>While the League of Entropy started out as an experimental network, with the guidance and support from the drand team at <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a>, it’s become a reliable and production-ready core Internet service, relied upon by applications ranging from <a href="https://spec.filecoin.io/libraries/drand/">distributed file storage</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/etherplay/status/1734875536608882799">online gaming</a> to <a href="https://medium.com/tierion/tierion-joins-the-league-of-entropy-replaces-nist-randomness-beacon-with-drand-in-chainpoint-9f3c32f0cd9b">timestamped proofs</a> to <a href="https://drand.love/docs/timelock-encryption/">timelock encryption</a> (discussed further below). The League of Entropy has also grown, and there are now 18 organizations across four continents participating in the drand network.</p><p>The League of Entropy’s drand beacons (each of which runs with different parameters, such as how frequently random values are produced and whether the randomness is <em>chained</em> – more on this below) have two important properties that contribute to their trustworthiness: they are <em>decentralized</em> and <em>verifiable</em>. Decentralization ensures that one or two bad actors cannot subvert or bias the randomness beacon, and verifiability allows anyone to check that the random values are produced according to the drand protocol and with participation from a threshold (at least half, but usually more) of the participants in the drand network. Thus, with each new member, the trustworthiness and reliability of the drand network continues to increase.</p><p>We give a brief overview of how drand achieves these properties using distributed key generation and threshold signatures below, but for an in-depth dive see our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-the-entropy">previous blog post</a> and some of the <a href="https://drand.love/blog/">excellent posts</a> from the drand team.</p><h3 id="distributed-key-generation-and-threshold-signatures">Distributed key generation and threshold signatures</h3><p>During the initial setup of a drand beacon, nodes in the network run a distributed key generation (DKG) protocol based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_key_generation">Pedersen commitment scheme</a>, the result of which is that each node holds a “share” (a keypair) for a distributed group key, which remains fixed for the lifetime of the beacon. In order to do something useful with the group secret key like signing a message, at least a threshold (for example 7 out of 9) of nodes in the network must participate in constructing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLS_digital_signature">BLS threshold signature</a>.

Further, anyone can validate the signature for a given round using the beacon’s group public key. It’s recommended that developers use the drand client <a href="https://drand.love/developer/clients/">libraries</a> or <a href="https://drand.love/developer/drand-client/">CLI</a> to perform verification on every value obtained from the beacon.</p><h3 id="chained-vs-unchained-randomness">Chained vs unchained randomness</h3><p>When the League of Entropy launched its first generation of drand beacons in 2019, the per-round message over which the group signature was computed included the previous round’s signature. This creates a chain of randomness rounds all the way to the first “genesis” round. Chained randomness provides some nice properties for single-source randomness beacons, and is included as a requirement in <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/interoperable-randomness-beacons">NIST’s spec for interoperable public randomness beacons</a>.</p><p>However, back in 2022 the drand team introduced the notion of <a href="https://drand.love/blog/2022/02/21/multi-frequency-support-and-timelock-encryption-capabilities/#unchained-randomness-timed-encryption">unchained randomness</a>, where the message to be signed is <em>predictable</em> and doesn’t depend on any randomness from previous rounds, and showed that it provides the same security guarantees as chained randomness for the drand network (both require an honest threshold of nodes). In the implementation of unchained randomness in the <a href="https://drand.love/blog/2023/10/16/quicknet-is-live/">quicknet</a>, the message to be signed simply consists of the round number.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code># chained randomness

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Unchained randomness provides some powerful properties and usability improvements. In terms of usability, a consumer of the randomness beacon does not need to reconstruct the full chain of randomness to the genesis round to fully validate a particular round – the only information needed is the current round number and the group public key. This provides much more flexibility for clients, as they can choose how frequently they consume randomness rounds without needing to continuously follow the randomness chain.</p><p>Since the messages to be signed are known in advance (since they’re just the round number), unchained randomness also unlocks a powerful new property: timelock encryption.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/03/image7-7.png" alt="Rotating double pendulums." loading="lazy" width="1999" height="381"><figcaption>Rotating double pendulums.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="timelock-encryption">Timelock encryption</h2><p>Timelock (or “timed-release”) encryption is a method for encrypting a message such that it cannot be decrypted until a certain amount of time has passed. Two basic approaches to timelock encryption were described by <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/149822/MIT-LCS-TR-684.pdf">Rivest, Shamir, and Wagner</a>:</p><p> There are two natural approaches to implementing timed release cryptography:</p><p>  - Use “time-lock puzzles” – computational problems that cannot be solved without running a computer continuously for at least a certain amount of time.</p><p>  - Use trusted agents who promise not to reveal certain information until a specified date.</p><p>Using trusted agents has the obvious problem of ensuring that the agents are trustworthy. Secret sharing approaches can be used to alleviate this concern.</p><p>The drand network is a group of independent agents using secret sharing for trustworthiness, and the ‘certain information’ not to be revealed until a specified date sounds a lot like the per-round randomness! We describe next how timelock encryption can be implemented on top of a drand network with unchained randomness, and finish with a practical demonstration. While we don’t delve into the bilinear groups and pairings-based cryptography that make this possible, if you’re interested we encourage you to read <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/189">tlock: Practical Timelock Encryption from Threshold BLS</a> by Nicolas Gailly, Kelsey Melissaris, and Yolan Romailler.</p><h3 id="how-to-timelock-your-secrets">How to timelock your secrets</h3><p>First, identify the randomness round that, once revealed, will allow your timelock-encrypted message to be decrypted. An important observation is that since drand networks produce randomness at fixed intervals, each round in a drand beacon is closely tied to a specific timestamp (modulo small delays for the network to actually produce the beacon) which can be easily computed taking the beacon’s genesis timestamp and then adding the round number multiplied by the beacon’s period.</p><p>Once the round is decided upon, the properties of bilinear groups allow you to encrypt your message to some round with the drand beacon’s group public key.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>ciphertext = EncryptToRound(msg, round, beacon_public_key)
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>After the nodes in the drand network cooperate to derive the randomness for the round (really, just the signature on the round number using the beacon’s group secret key), <em>anyone</em> can decrypt the ciphertext (this is where the magic of bilinear groups comes in).</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>random = Randomness(round)
message = Decrypt(ciphertext,random)
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>To make this practical, the timelocked message is actually the secret key for a symmetric scheme. This means that we encrypt the message with a symmetric key and encrypt the key with timelock, allowing for a decryption in the future.</p><p>Now, for a practical demonstration of timelock encryption, we use a tool that one of our own engineers built on top of Cloudflare Workers. The <a href="https://github.com/thibmeu/tlock-worker">source code</a> is publicly available if you’d like to take a look under the hood at how it works.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code># 1. Create a file
echo "A message from the past to the future..." &gt; original.txt

# 2. Get the drand round 1 minute into the future (20 rounds)

ROUND=$(curl "https://drand.cloudflare.com/$BEACON/public/latest" | jq ".round+20")

# 3. Encrypt and require that round number
curl -X POST --data-binary @original.txt --output encrypted.pem https://tlock-worker.crypto-team.workers.dev/encrypt/$ROUND

# 4. Try to decrypt it (and only succeed 20 rounds x 3s later)
curl -X POST --data-binary @encrypted.pem --fail --show-error https://tlock-worker.crypto-team.workers.dev/decrypt
</code></pre>

<p>Until recently, and for well over the past decade, my wife and I have been nomads. Moving from the Caribbean to Miami, New York, Las Vegas, Vancouver, and now back home. This has meant that for many of those years, my home office basically comprised of a few laptops and screens.</p>
<p>These days, we are more settled; my wife has completed her studies, works full-time, and my full-time job remains remote, via a home office <a href="https://linuxblog.io/web-server-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supporting Linux servers</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://stacklinux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hosting them</a>.</p>
<p>After a short trip to Antigua, I had a brief meeting with a tech friend of mine, <a href="http://www.yvesephraim.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yves Ephraim</a>. He was an Engineer with <a href="https://www.cwnetworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cable &amp; Wireless</a> for 20 years (until 2003). Yves left C&amp;W shortly before I started there in 2004. He’s a champion of the internet and&nbsp;technological developments in Antigua &amp; Barbuda.</p>
<p>We sat in his home office, where he told me a bit about his current projects, as well as his dabbling with <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPv6</a>, web hosting, mail, <a href="https://www.bgp4.as/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BGP4</a>, among other things. Most of which he does via his very capable home lab.</p>

<h2><span id="What_is_a_Home_Lab"></span>What is a Home Lab?<span></span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" title="My Home Lab - 2020" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/my_homelab-868x868.jpg" alt="My Home Lab - 2020" width="868" height="868" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/my_homelab-868x868.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/my_homelab-300x300.jpg 300w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/my_homelab-560x560.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" loading="eager" fetchpriority="high"><br>
<em>My current Home lab in a 12u rack as of May 2020</em></p>
<p>Think of a home lab as&nbsp;a place where you can fail in the privacy of your own home. As Thomas A. Edison said: <em>“I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.”</em> I consider myself an expert at failure. But seriously, I would like to fail a lot more, and a home lab will create endless opportunities for me to fail. Of course, all the while seeking success, but you got that already.</p>
<p>In general, a lab is a place where you can safely perform experiments. Most of you reading this article are techies and sysadmins. As you know, trying out new things on production equipment never ends well. Shush… it’s OK, I know, I know, you didn’t think that one command would take everything offline. This risk is the reason why we build ourselves a sandbox environment to dabble, test, and fail in, all from the comfort of our own homes.</p>
<p>To date, I host my test labs on servers in North America and Europe. I’m creating a customized network and server home lab; to fill those areas where I would like to become more familiar. I will also be using my home lab for remote backups, <a href="https://linuxblog.io/20-top-server-monitoring-application-performance-monitoring-apm-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">network monitoring and alerting of remote servers</a>, and wired UAP APs, among other things.</p>
<h2><span id="May_we_inspire_each_other_to_great_home_labs"></span>May we inspire each other to great home labs<span></span></h2>
<p>As I told Yves, our chat had me revisiting the idea. In fact, I think my exact words were, “Yves, I see your home lab, and I’ll raise you mine.” As always, I’m certain there’s a lot more to learn through discussion. In light of this fact, I wanted to share this journey with you, starting with the hardware selection process for my home lab.</p>
<p>Of course, over the years, I’ve had equipment lying around, but that stops today. Well, sort of. So, if you have ever been interested in building a home lab or if you already have one, then <a href="https://linuxcommunity.io/t/how-to-build-a-homelab/49" target="_blank" rel="noopener">let’s mingle, share and dabble together</a>.</p>
<p>Where do we begin? Not to sound cliché, but let’s start from the ground up, or wall forward. What I’m trying to say is, we need storage space, physical storage space, for our new home lab.</p>
<h2><span id="Home_lab_location_its_all_about_location"></span>Home lab location, it’s all about location.<span></span></h2>
<p>Location, Location, Location. It’s all about location! Please excuse the lack of originality – I’m a sysadmin, not a writer. I’ll try my best to get you to the end of this article.</p>
<p>Location is critical for several reasons. The choice between the home office, living room, closet, attic, basement, or garage depends on a range of important variables. These include room temperature and ventilation, workable space around your equipment, ease and distance of network cable runs, foot traffic, 24-hour ease of access, power, noise levels from your home lab, and more.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick list of Pros vs. Cons I’ve compiled to get us thinking about all the possible home lab locations. Choose wisely:</p>
<p><strong>Home office</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Proximity to work area/desk/devices, fewer cable runs, and you can watch lights flash all day.</li>
<li>Cons: no home office or you already spend too much time in your home office.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Living room</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Usually cool, lots of space/setup options, blinky-blinky sci-fi movie nights, and counts as family time.</li>
<li>Cons: divorce, foot traffic, could get damaged, or damaged during the divorce.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Closet</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Easily accessible, stealthy, and you get to say: “Look at what I have hiding in my closet.”</li>
<li>Cons: Poor ventilation (excess heat), lack of space, and one less closet = unhappy wife.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Basement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Usually cooler temps, and volunteering to do laundry (maybe con?).</li>
<li>Cons: don’t have a basement, flooding, spiders, or no access when injured.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Less noise, easier cable runs.</li>
<li>Cons: can get hot depending on where you live, roof leaks, humidity/condensation, and creepy at night.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Garage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Less noise in the house, completely out of sight, wife won’t even notice.</li>
<li>Cons: A Bug’s Life <em>in</em> your lab, excess heat (if no AC), dust, could require longer cables, or gets wrecked when parking the car.</li>
</ul>
<p>For my lab, I’m going to build it out in my home office. I have laptops, a desktop, a server, and other devices in my office, so that this location will require shorter cable runs. When selecting your location, consider the coolest area of the room/space, avoid direct sunlight and consider reserving space for future expansion.</p>
<p>It’s wise if you draw/sketch out a home network diagram or <a href="https://www.smartdraw.com/network-diagram/how-to-draw-network-diagrams.htm">use network design software</a>. Keep in mind your floor plan and how you will accomplish the cable runs. For example, most of the homes on this island have 8″ concrete interior walls. Think about these things before, not after. In other words, map everything out, make notes and create lists.</p>
<h2><span id="Network_vs_Server_Racks_vs_Cabinets"></span>Network vs. Server Racks vs. Cabinets?<span></span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" title="home lab rack vs cabinet" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/home_lab_rack_vs_cabinet-868x399.jpg" alt="home lab rack vs cabinet" width="868" height="399" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/home_lab_rack_vs_cabinet.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/home_lab_rack_vs_cabinet-300x138.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"></p>
<p>Next, we need to decide how we will store the equipment (modems, routers, switches, servers, patch panels, UPS systems, power strips, cooling fans, etc.).</p>
<p>Network cabinets and racks are often confused with S<em>erver</em> cabinets and racks. R<span><span>outers</span></span>, switches, patch panels, and the like are usually much shallower than servers. As such, Network Cabinets and Racks are usually not as deep as Server Cabinets and Racks. Also, networking devices often produce less heat than servers. You will find some network cabinets will have glass doors that may not leave enough ventilation for servers.</p>
<p>After deciding the depth and ventilation requirements for your home lab, there are a couple of other things to consider. A cabinet is an enclosed space with door(s) and/or removable sides, whereas a rack is a semi or fully open (4 sides open) frame. To help you decide whether to use a cabinet or rack, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are <strong>installing large, heavy servers</strong>, then the extra stability of cabinets or four-sided racks should be considered.</li>
<li>If you <strong>need frequent access</strong> to the sides or rear of equipment, then an open rack or cabinet with removable sides would work well.</li>
<li>If your <strong>equipment requires extra cooling</strong>, an enclosed cabinet will need more attention to cooling and ventilation.</li>
<li>If the <strong>room is prone to dust</strong>, the extra protection of a cabinet will go a long way in keeping it out of your equipment.</li>
<li>If you are <strong>installing in a general living area</strong> frequented by house guests, consider an enclosed cabinet that can often look neater in appearance when locked. However, a well-maintained open rack with tidy power and network cable runs can look just as neat!</li>
<li>If <strong>restricted access/security</strong> is required, many enclosed cabinets often offer lock and key access control for better security.</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I’ve updated the article. Some of the devices mentioned have been discontinued or are not readily accessible anymore. I’ve updated with upgrades I’ve made and other recommended hardware and accessories. It’s been nearly four years since my original homelab build.</em></p>
<p>Now that you have already measured your equipment’s maximum depth and considered all the above advice, it’s time to buy your first piece of hardware. Or not. You could have probably skipped to this section if you prefer more em’, creative methods for hosting your home lab. However, most of the above advice applies even if you plan to set up your home lab in your existing living room cabinet, on a bookshelf, under your desk, or in a cardboard box. No, seriously…</p>

<h3><span id="To_replace_or_not_to_replace_ISP_Cable_Modem"></span>To replace or not to replace: ISP Cable Modem<span></span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="replace cable modem" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/replace_cable_modem-868x196.jpg" alt="replace cable modem" width="868" height="196" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/replace_cable_modem.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/replace_cable_modem-300x68.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"></p>
<p>Before we delve a bit deeper into my home lab recommendations, if you are a beginner to switching and routing, then a lot of the hardware below may seem to be a bit of an overkill. You can get your feet wet by merely replacing your ISP’s cable modem (ISP or Internet Service Provider), you know, that thing with all the flashing lights that you frequently have to unplug to reset to regain internet access. Yup, that one, the mini heater in your living room.</p>
<p>Most US ISPs charge monthly rental for that thing. Buying your own could make some financial sense. As well as giving better performance, reliability, and security. Bet you were already sold with the financial bit eh? But it gets better; most of these modems provided by ISPs are usually of poor quality, used, and lack features. Lastly, your ISP’s Modem/Router combos often cannot independently update firmware versions as new exploits emerge. This means you are at the mercy of your ISP to push new patched firmware.</p>
<p>If you have a great ISP and this does not apply to you, stick with your modem. The only reason to replace it in such circumstances will be to have access to additional network features and create a home lab where you can test away! I replaced the modem/router combo from my ISP. I went with the <a href="https://amzn.to/32lbV1h" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Motorola MB7420 16×4 Cable Modem</a>. <em>Update: 3 years later, there are much faster models, for example, the <span id="productTitle"><a href="https://amzn.to/3ZwNtrn">Motorola MB7621 32×8</a>.</span></em></p>
<p>If you would like to keep things simple, then go with a <a href="https://amzn.to/3a5Lmzx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modem + Wi-Fi router combo</a>. Otherwise, continue if you would like to build out a home lab to manage Firewall, NAS storage, VPN, VLANs, PoE (Power over Ethernet), Virtualization, remote network infrastructure monitoring/alerting, wired APs, web servers, backup servers, the list goes on.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> This modem, similar to most I’ve used, gives off quite a bit of heat. When deciding placement, I would suggest toward the top or leave space below and above. That said, I love this modem! Unlike the ISP’s modem, it shows the quality of your connection, including Freq. (MHz), Pwr (dBmV), SNR (dB), corrected and uncorrected, and even allows manual downstream frequency setting if needed by your ISP.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<h3><span id="Selecting_Your_Home_Lab_Rack"></span>Selecting Your Home Lab Rack<span></span></h3>
<p>A rack <em>unit</em>&nbsp;(abbreviated&nbsp;<em>U</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>RU</em>) is a unit of measure defined as 1 3⁄4 inches (or 44.45 mm). It’s the unit of measurement for the height of 19-inch and 23-inch rack frames and the equipment’s height. The height of the frame/equipment is expressed as multiples of rack units. A typical full-size rack is 42U high. Racks and cabinets are then listed as 1U, 2U, 3U, 4U, and so on.</p>
<p>Here’s an example below of a 6U rack (labeled):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="6u rack example" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/6u-rack-2-868x583.jpg" alt="6u rack example" width="868" height="583" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/6u-rack-2.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/6u-rack-2-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/39XLcdz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StarTech 12U Wall Mount Rack – 13.5″ Deep / 19″ wide / 125lbs Capacity</a> – $158 (<a href="https://www.startech.com/Server-Management/Racks/12u-wall-mount-rack~WALLMNT12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specs</a>) – During my search for a wall-mounted rack, I almost purchased the 6U version of this rack, then at the last minute, I switched to the 12U version for possible future expansion.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2STvDy3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samson SRK-12 Universal Equipment Rack Stand</a>&nbsp;– $230 (<a href="http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/accessories/racks/srk8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specs</a>) – This was my first choice; this is an audio equipment rack that is fully compatible with shallow-mount equipment. One advantage is that it’s supported on wheels, so you don’t have to fix it to a wall or floor. However, I’m 6′ 2″, and I want to mount my rack about 4′ off the ground, so as you will see, I have also purchased a 2U cooling fan (intake), which I will place at or to the bottom of my setup. If your room is air-conditioned 24/7 and you don’t mind the low-to-floor setup, this may be the rack for you. Here’s a <a href="https://imgur.com/BAGlEvA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">great example of how clean this Rack can look when set up</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3974q0c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NavePoint 9U Basic IT Wall Mount Network Rack Locking Glass Door</a> – $235 (<a href="https://navepoint.com/navepoint-9u-450mm-depth-wallmount-networking-cabinet-assembled-basic-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specs</a>) – This is a very beautiful-looking Network Cabinet. The issue for me is that I only use the AC in my office in the summer, and I don’t want the heat ever to be an issue; thus, for my home setup, an enclosed cabinet wasn’t right for me.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Update:&nbsp;</strong>This is a very solid wall-mount rack. I can confirm that what you see is what you get. No issues to report. It does exactly what it’s supposed to.</em></p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="CyberPower OR500LCDRM1U" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CyberPower-OR500LCDRM1U-868x99.jpg" alt="CyberPower OR500LCDRM1U" width="868" height="99" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CyberPower-OR500LCDRM1U.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CyberPower-OR500LCDRM1U-300x34.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"></p>
<p>At home, we have a backup generator that runs on propane. It can run for up to a week, which is useful in the tropics. Other than hurricane season, power cuts are extremely rare here. So far, for 2020, we have had one outage due to a lightning strike on a nearby electrical post.</p>
<p>It takes a minute or so to failover to the backup generator. So the rack mount UPS solution I’m looking for is something that will support between 100W and 200W for a couple of minutes. Long enough to fail over to the backup gen or to shut down all the equipment cleanly. In the future, I may expand this with larger batteries, but with no way of returning anything I purchase, I’m a bit wary of investing in a larger backup battery only to find out it’s a dud. I will test for a year first, and so here’s what I decided on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/38QM7wi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CyberPower OR500LCDRM1U UPS, 500VA/300W, 6 Outlets, AVR, 1U Rackmount</a> – $220 (<a href="https://www.cyberpowersystems.com/product/ups/smart-app-lcd/or500lcdrm1u/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specs</a>) – A small 1U rackmount UPS coming in at 20lbs, which should give me around 10 to 15 minutes of runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, you will have to decide whether you even require an uninterruptible power supply at home. From experience, UPS batteries are almost always a disappointment, and this is largely because of the cost vs. return. If you really need to have a UPS, you could spend thousands just to have a long enough runtime. If you work from home or host critical services hosted from home – you probably shouldn’t – then it may be worthwhile. My advice, get a UPS that provides just enough runtime for everything to shut down cleanly and only use the UPS for the most essential and efficient devices in your home lab. With all things considered, I’ll have to come back to this section before recommending any other UPS models.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Surprisingly, the battery performance of this UPS so far is above my expectations. I ran it down to around 50%, which gave me just over 30 mins of run time, including powering<a href="https://amzn.to/2vdi1EO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 2 PoE APs</a> and a <a href="https://amzn.to/3T8OXnf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">27″ monitor</a>. As mentioned later in this article, pay attention to your power consumption. This was something I considered, and it’s paid off thus far. The APs for example, max power consumption is just 6.5W per AP. The max load is about 20% to 30% of UPS capacity.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Did you notice that the CyberPower 1U UPS does not have rack mounts? Of course, you could rest it on top of other equipment; however, I wouldn’t recommend that because we should keep the batteries as cool as possible and leave space between equipment to reduce the amount of trapped heat. Lastly, for this setup, it will look more professional if placed on a ventilated 1U rack shelf:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2SVmwga" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AC Infinity Vented Cantilever 1U Universal Rack Shelf, 10″ Deep, for 19”</a> – $30 (<a href="https://www.acinfinity.com/rack-accessories/rack-shelves/vented-cantilever-1u-rack-shelf-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specs</a>) – These shelves are available from 6″ to 16″ deep. The backup battery is 9.5″. Pay attention to the depth of your rack/cabinet and equipment before deciding what you need.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Very sturdy, great for keeping equipment cool and cable management thanks to the vents and slots.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The aforementioned CyberPower UPS comes with six outlets – four backup /w surge + two surges only. Currently, under my desk, I’m using seven outlets, and this is before ordering a replacement ISP modem, router, switch, servers and does not consider any future expansion. Right above the UPS, I will be mounting the following:</p>

</ul>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> This is a very convenient piece of hardware. It plugs directly into the UPS and allows easy on/off switching of other equipment and devices.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Maintaining an optimal temperature for rack-mounted equipment prevents overheating, ensures consistent performance, and extends their lifespan. The plan is to mount an intake fan at the bottom rack unit position (remember hot air rises). After testing, I will decide whether I’ll need an exhaust fan at the very top of the rack.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> At the lowest fan speed, this cools rack temps by about 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit. I’ll update my thoughts again in the summer.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Update 2:</em></strong> As of September 2022, two of the four fans have failed. I’ve removed it from the rack and will try to clean it with compressed air. Over the past 2 years of use, they are filled with dust! I still recommend buying these units, but I also recommend cleaning them out more often than I have!</p>

<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: Just what I needed. The router runs modified Debian. How cool! It’s packed with enterprise features. I’m excited to learn full command line management.&nbsp;</em></p>
<h3><span id="Home_Lab_Patch_Panels_and_Network_Cables"></span>Home Lab Patch Panels and Network Cables<span></span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/16-port-patch-panel-2-868x234.jpg" alt="16 port patch panel" width="868" height="234" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/16-port-patch-panel-2.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/16-port-patch-panel-2-300x81.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"></p>
<p>In hindsight, I should have gone with the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Tflgn9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">24 port patch panel</a>. Instead, I went with <a href="https://amzn.to/2Vh9lYA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this 16 port patch panel</a> because, well, I liked how centered and less busy it looked. I know. I don’t want to hear it. But look at that thing! If it isn’t already obvious by the 16 ports, it’s the image just above.</p>
<p>The fastest internet plan available from my ISP is 160Mbps down / 30Mbps up. For my home lab, I won’t be needing CAT8 or CAT7 anytime soon, and I don’t need high LAN traffic. So I purchased <a href="https://amzn.to/2PldEy5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">250′ of regular CAT6 reel</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://amzn.to/37XehEK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some different lengths Cat6</a> as I’m ok with the 1000Mbps limit. Yeah, I also like my coffee black. If you want smoother network traffic, then, by all means, go for at least <a href="https://blog.tripplite.com/cat6-vs-cat6a-ethernet-cables-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAT6a</a>. However, make sure you go with a&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2w07tc3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shielded patch panel</a>. Going CAT7 cable or Cat6a is a waste of money if your RJ45 connectors and patch panels don’t support it. “Keep it simple stupid!” No, I’m not talking to you; that was me speaking to myself while selecting the patch panel and cables.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> High quality! Easy to punch down. All my patch connections worked on the first try.</em></p>

<p>For this article’s purpose, I won’t recommend any specific servers because this will vary a ton depending on what you will be hosting. NAS storage, VMs, web servers, backup servers, mail servers, ad blockers, and all the rest.

<em><a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/i8YdrnU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Image</a>: your setup, should be your setup. As traditional or as custom as you’d like!</em></p>
<p>When writing this guide, I tried my best to convey my passion, thoughts, and considerations throughout the selection process. It’s important that you find your passion when it comes to building your home lab. What will you use it for? How will it benefit you and others?</p>
<p>If you have a plan, and if your lab will be something you enjoy learning, failing, and succeeding with, it will pay for itself in one way or another. That said, be careful with the power consumption! You don’t want to end up with… <em>mortgage of $1,100, a power bill of $1,200, the feeling when walking into your home lab… NOT priceless.</em></p>
<p>Plan with room to expand, and feel free to start small. You don’t have to start with a rack, cabinet, patch panels, and all the other gear. Get your feet wet, replace your ISP modem, then build from there. Avoid making rash decisions on hardware; instead, sleep on it. Then, post a question or two in the <strong><a href="https://linuxcommunity.io/t/how-to-build-a-homelab/49" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new community forums</a></strong>,&nbsp;to get valuable feedback from other techies and sysadmins. You will find that the more you research, it will open up additional ways to get things just right or very wrong. More importantly, have fun! Share your home lab goals with your spouse, colleagues, kids, and that neighbor across the street who still only waves after five years.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update 1 – March 10th, 2020:</em> </strong></p>
<p>As of today, I’ve almost completed the setup of my new Home lab, and it’s now fully functional. I’m pleased with all of the items purchased. For this update, I’ve added to the article some highlights, tips, and findings below each hardware item in <em>italics</em>.</p>
<p>One thing I missed in the original article and Home lab setup was the coaxial cable. The existing cable turned out to be about three feet shorter than required. Tomorrow, I’ll replace it with a longer cable. As you can see, I’ve also replaced the ISP modem with the Motorola model listed below.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the <a href="https://www.ui.com/products/#edgemax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubiquiti EdgeRouter and EdgeSwitch</a> turned out to be about an inch too wide. I failed to consider this because I measured their combined width and then compared that measurement to the rack’s interior width instead of the width of the rack shelf. Oops! Now, so that the switch doesn’t remain sitting on the router, I’ve just ordered two <a href="https://amzn.to/2PZPFVu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubiquiti rack mounts</a>. Better cooling and aesthetics, but also the rack mounts will allow positioning the router and switch directly below the 16 port patch panel pictured below.&nbsp; Check back in a week or two for another update.</p>

						   <p>Out-of-control behavior by CEOs and other powerful people constantly makes headlines – so much so that some might consider impulsivity a pathway to power. New research from the UC San Diego Rady School of Management and Texas A&amp;M University finds that having self-control is often what leads to power.</p>

<p>In a paper published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, researchers find that showing self-control influences how powerful an individual is perceived to be by their peers, as well as how much power they are granted by those peers. In a series of seven experiments with roughly 3,500 participants, both students and working adults read about or interacted with individuals with varying levels of self-control, which the researchers define as how much people tend to behave in ways aligned with their goals. Across all experiments, individuals with high self-control were seen as more powerful, and as better suited for powerful roles, than individuals with low self-control.</p>

<p>In one experiment, working adults imagined a scenario where a colleague with the goal of being fit either ate a large dessert or abstained from dessert altogether. Researchers found that the colleague was seen as being better suited for high-power roles when they abstained from indulging, an indication of self-control.</p>

<p>“It did not matter whether the colleague seemed to deliberate before acting, or just acted without thinking,“ said Pamela Smith, associate<u> </u>professor of management at the Rady School of Management and co-author of the study. “What mattered for participants’ judgments was whether the colleague acted in line with their goals. This pattern held across a variety of goals in our experiments, including saving money, being healthy and reading books.”</p>

<p>The researchers also found that people are perceived as less powerful and less suited for powerful roles when they fail to meet ambitious goals, even if their performance is the same as their peers. In an experiment investigating how self-control often leads to power,&nbsp;a group of undergraduate students interacted with individuals who set various reading goals. Some set an ambitious goal of reading 200 pages each week, while others set a more moderate goal of reading 50 pages per week. All of these individuals read the same amount – 100 pages – but those who didn’t meet their goal were seen as less powerful by study participants. Furthermore, study participants were less interested in having those who didn’t meet their goal as the group leader in later tasks.</p>

<p>“To motivate their employees, organizations often want employees to set stretch goals – goals that are challenging and hard-to-reach. However, we found that setting a stretch goal and not meeting it makes someone look less powerful than setting an easy goal and surpassing it,” said Rady School PhD student Shuang Wu, the first author of the paper.</p>

<p>The paper, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2024-47709-001">“Self-Control Signals and Affords Power,”</a> was also co-authored with Texas A&amp;M University associate professor Rachel Smallman.&nbsp;</p>

															<div>
    	<p><span>European companies are exporting hundreds of tonnes of a notoriously toxic pesticide – banned in Europe because of its links to brain damage in children and unborn babies – to countries in the Global South.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Documents obtained under freedom of information laws by </span><i><span>Unearthed </span></i><span>and Public Eye, a Swiss NGO, have revealed that in the second half of last year European companies issued notifications for the export of more than 380 tonnes of banned chlorpyrifos insecticides. The same companies plan to ship similar amounts this year.</span></p>
<p><span>The investigation reveals for the first time Europe’s continued export trade in chlorpyrifos since </span><a href="https://euobserver.com/investigations/146858"><span>its use was prohibited in the EU in 2020</span></a><span>. This ‘organophosphate’ pesticide was </span><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1578929027090&amp;uri=CELEX:32020R0018"><span>banned from EU fields</span></a><span> in response to scientific evidence that it caused “adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children”.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/health/pesticides-epa-chlorpyrifos-scott-pruitt.html"><span>decades of research</span></a><span> suggesting chlorpyrifos exposure </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1203396109"><span>harms</span></a> <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l962"><span>young children</span></a><span> and babies in the womb. Studies have linked pre-birth exposure to the chemical to </span><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/12/061206095256.htm"><span>developmental delays</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5414283/"><span>autism</span></a><span>, and reduction in IQ; </span><a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2011/04/20/prenatal-pesticide-exposure-lower-iq/"><span>one study</span></a><span> found that the greater a mother’s exposure to the chemical during pregnancy, the lower her child’s IQ at the age of seven.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>It is not fair to poor countries that the health of many should continue to be compromised to maintain the business of a few</span></p>

<p>– <em>Fernando Ramírez Muñoz, pesticide expert, National University of Costa Rica</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Despite these risks, companies continue to export chlorpyrifos from the EU to poorer countries with weaker regulations. Almost all of Europe’s 2022 exports of the chemical – sent from Belgium and Denmark by the multinational pesticide companies UPL and FMC – were destined for low- or middle-income countries (LMICs).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The main destinations were Algeria, Tunisia, Kazakhstan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Costa Rica. The risks posed by using highly hazardous pesticides in LMICs are “</span><a href="https://www.fao.org/3/ca6847en/ca6847en.pdf"><span>almost without exception</span></a><span>” much higher than they would be in rich countries, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.</span></p>
<p><span>“It is not fair to poor countries that the health of many should continue to be compromised in order to maintain the business of a few,” said Fernando Ramírez Muñoz, an academic at the Central American Institute for Studies of Toxic Substances, in Costa Rica. “Chlorpyrifos is banned in the EU because of proven facts, but it seems these facts do not apply in low-income countries.”</span></p>
<p><span>The EU’s behaviour demonstrated a “double standard”, added </span><span>Ramírez Muñoz: “It prohibits the use of this substance in its territories for health reasons, especially in children, but continues with its production and shipment to other countries where it is used for food production, as if in these countries the lives of infants who are exposed to chlorpyrifos have no value.”</span></p>
<p><span>Loopholes in European law mean that when a pesticide is banned from use in the EU, pesticide companies remain free to manufacture and export it to countries where its use is still permitted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The European Commission (EC) has </span><a href="https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2020/10/15/eu-banned-pesticide-exports-public-eye/"><span>promised</span></a><span> to bring forward proposals this year to end this practice, but it remains unclear when the consultation will begin, what the scope of the new law will be, and whether it will be enacted.</span></p>

    	<p><b>Irreversible impacts</b></p>
<p><span>The EU banned chlorpyrifos in 2020 after years of campaigning by health and environmental groups. By the time the ban was agreed, various member states – including the UK – had already prohibited its use in their own fields, and studies had found the chemical in the urine of mothers and children in multiple EU countries – even </span><a href="https://euobserver.com/health-and-society/145146"><span>Sweden</span></a><span>, where its use had never been authorised.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This EU-wide ban “finally acknowledged the substance’s irreversible impacts for health over a lifetime” and “was an important victory for the health of children and future generations,” said Natacha Cingotti, health and chemicals lead at the Health and Environment Alliance.</span></p>

    	<p><span>Cingotti, whose NGO was among those leading the campaign for a European ban, added: “Continuing to export this pesticide to third countries is unacceptable, [and is] seriously damaging the credibility of the European Union’s global commitments to health and environment protection.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“The intrinsic properties of a substance are not country-dependent, and people, especially vulnerable groups such as children, deserve the same level of protection everywhere.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Shortly after the ban was introduced, the EU </span><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32020R1085R(01)"><span>slashed</span></a><span> the maximum amount of chlorpyrifos residue that could be present on imported food to the lowest “limit of analytical determination”. In effect, this banned the import into the EU of food containing any detectable traces of the pesticide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Semia Gharbi, a Tunisian environmental science expert and chair of the country’s </span><a href="https://www.no-burn.org/meet-our-members-aeefg/"><span>Association of Environmental Education for Future Generations</span></a><span>, told </span><i><span>Unearthed </span></i><span>and Public Eye that a shipment of Tunisian oranges was recently rejected and returned by the EU because it contained chlorpyrifos residues.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In 2022, Tunisia was the second-largest market, by volume, for the EU’s chlorpyrifos exports.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The North African country was the intended destination for 70 tonnes of the chlorpyrifos-based insecticide Pyrical 480, exported from Belgium by Arysta LifeScience Benelux. The Belgian company, a subsidiary of the pesticide giant UPL, plans to send the same amount again to Tunisia this year.</span></p>
<p><span>Gharbi said it was “imperative” that the EU practice of exporting prohibited pesticides was banned, and it fit “exactly the definition of colonialism”, which was to “legitimise the domination and economic exploitation of territories”.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>This situation, besides being ethically and morally unbearable, leads to an imbalance of the market</span></p>

<p><em><span>– Zakia Khattabi, Belgian environment minister </span></em></p></blockquote>
<p><span>The EC </span><a href="https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2020/10/15/eu-banned-pesticide-exports-public-eye/"><span>made a promise in 2020</span></a><span> to bring forward legislative proposals this year to ensure chemicals banned in the EU are not produced or exported. Environment commissioner Virginijus Sinkevičius recently wrote to civil society groups assuring them that the Commission was “fully committed” to doing this and planned to “present a proposal to the European Parliament and Council in the course of 2023”.</span></p>
<p><span>However, the plan faces </span><a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2022/10/19/les-lobbies-de-l-industrie-chimique-ont-gagne-la-commission-europeenne-enterre-le-plan-d-interdiction-des-substances-toxiques-pour-la-sante-et-l-environnement_6146397_3244.html"><span>fierce opposition</span></a><span> from the chemical lobby, and campaigners fear the proposal may arrive too late to deliver a change in the law before the next European parliamentary elections in 2024. A public consultation on the plan was supposed to begin in the first quarter of 2023, but it is not yet launched.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Belgium, the EU’s main chlorpyrifos exporter in 2022, supports an EU ban on the export of banned pesticides and is also taking steps to introduce a national ban. In December 2022, Belgian environment minister Zakia Khattabi released a draft Royal Decree that would prohibit various banned pesticide exports from Belgium.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Noting that Belgium was one of Europe’s main exporters of banned pesticides, she said at the time: “This situation, besides being ethically and morally unbearable, leads to an imbalance of the market with unfair competition from third countries who can use certain chemicals.</span></p>
<p><span>“There is also a boomerang effect at the expense of the European consumer, who finds imported food on his or her plate that has been treated with these harmful exported substances.”</span></p>
<p><span>A spokesperson for Khattabi told </span><i><span>Unearthed </span></i><span>and Public Eye that she intended to update the Royal Decree to include a ban on chlorpyrifos exports during the next stage of the legislative process. The decree is expected to come into force in around six months.</span></p>
<p><span>However, </span><a href="https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2022/11/30/france-still-exporting-prohibited-pesticides-despite-landmark-ban/"><span>a recent investigation</span></a><span> by </span><i><span>Unearthed </span></i><span>and Public Eye into a similar ban in France found that while export bans by individual EU member states have an impact, they also have limitations. In the absence of an EU-wide ban, multinational pesticide companies can adapt to national bans by shifting their export trade to subsidiaries in other member states. </span></p>

    	<p><b>High health risk</b></p>
<p><span>One of the few restrictions currently placed on Europe’s exporters of banned pesticides is the EU ‘prior informed consent’ (PIC) regulation. Under this set of rules, an exporting country is required to give importing countries prior warning if it intends to send them pesticides which are banned or severely restricted on its own farms.</span></p>
<p><span>This means that every time a company wants to ship a banned pesticide it has to produce an ‘export notification’ document, to be sent to the authorities in the importing country. Chlorpyrifos became subject to these rules on 1 July 2022.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Using freedom of information laws, </span><i><span>Unearthed </span></i><span>and Public Eye obtained every export notification issued for chlorpyrifos shipments in 2022, and most of those issued so far this current year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These documents are not a perfect record, but they are the most precise paper trail available for the EU’s continuing trade in this hazardous pesticide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They show that in the second half of 2022, Belgium was by far Europe’s biggest exporter of chlorpyrifos. UPL’s Belgian subsidiary notified exports of 349 tonnes of chlorpyrifos insecticides, 91% of the European total.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These exports were destined for 16 countries, with the main destinations being Algeria, Tunisia, Kazakhstan, Bangladesh and Costa Rica. Other importing countries included the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Armenia. UPL has already issued plans to ship another 313 tonnes of chlorpyrifos exports from Belgium in 2023. The list of destinations is largely the same, although this year it includes Serbia.</span></p>

    	<p><span>A UPL spokesperson said: “UPL is compliant with all [Belgium], EU and international laws and regulations.”</span></p>
<p><span>Denmark is also manufacturing and exporting chlorpyrifos-based insecticides, the documents reveal. In 2022, the Danish company Cheminova – which is now a subsidiary of the pesticide giant FMC – notified the authorities of 33.2 tonnes of chlorpyrifos-based exports. Of this, 2 tonnes were destined for Lebanon, and the remaining 31.2 tonnes were for Pakistan.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So far in 2023, Cheminova has already notified a</span><span>nother 55 tonnes of shipments to Pakistan –</span><span> a country where studies have found that exposure to chlorpyrifos and other organophosphates is linked to </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7967685/"><span>increased risk of metabolic disorder</span></a><span>, and overuse of these pesticides is so prevalent that dust from farms ends up creating </span><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171130170208.htm"><span>a ‘high health risk’ in major cities</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>Because chlorpyrifos causes damage to early brain development, this EU-produced pesticide harms the cognitive skills in the next generation</span></p>

<p><em>– <span>Philippe Grandjean, professor of environmental medicine, Denmark</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p><span>A spokesperson for FMC confirmed to </span><i><span>Unearthed </span></i><span>that the company was “formulating a small volume of chlorpyrifos-containing products” in Denmark.</span></p>
<p><span>Since 2021, the use of chlorpyrifos on food crops has even been banned </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-takes-action-address-risk-chlorpyrifos-and-protect-childrens-health"><span>in FMC’s home country of the US</span></a><span>, which has notoriously permissive pesticide rules compared with the EU.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, FMC’s spokesperson argued that under the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation’s criteria, “chlorpyrifos is not an HHP [highly hazardous pesticide]”.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>He added</span><span>: “Products can be registered [licensed] and effective for use on crops in certain countries as directed on their label, even if those products are not registered in other countries due to climate, crop and pest differences. All crop protection products are rigorously tested and regulated by authorities, and FMC crop protection products are considered safe when used in accordance with label instructions.</span></p>
<p><span>“Nonetheless, chlorpyrifos comprises a smaller and smaller portion of FMC’s global portfolio.”</span></p>
<p><span>He pointed out that the figures cited by </span><i><span>Unearthed </span></i><span>and Public Eye were for the total volume of chlorpyrifos-based pesticides notified for export, and that the weight of the chemical itself that was exported was therefore lower.</span></p>
<p><span>The concentration of chlorpyrifos in the insecticides that FMC exports from Denmark ranges from 30 to 44 per cent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Philippe Grandjean is a professor of environmental medicine at the University of Southern Denmark, and was one of the scientists who uncovered problems with the industry-funded toxicology that had been used to support chlorpyrifos’ authorisation in Europe.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>He told </span><i><span>Unearthed </span></i><span>and Public Eye: “Because chlorpyrifos causes damage to early brain development, this EU-produced pesticide harms the cognitive skills in the next generation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“And given the damage our generation has caused, we need to protect as much as possible the intelligence of future children, as they need to generate smart solutions to all the damage that we have created.”</span></p>

  	</div>

							
						
															<div>
    	<p><strong>How we did it</strong></p><p><i><span>Unearthed </span></i><span>and Public Eye filed freedom of information requests to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and the Belgian government, in the second half of 2022 and early 2023, to obtain every export notification issued until that point for products containing chlorpyrifos.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These are documents that companies need to issue before exporting banned pesticides to non-EU countries, under the terms of the EU’s </span><a href="https://echa.europa.eu/fr/regulations/prior-informed-consent/understanding-pic"><span>Prior Informed Consent Regulation</span></a><span>, which is based on the terms of the UN’s Rotterdam Convention.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The documents are issued to the authorities in the importing country before shipment, and indicate the estimated</span><span> amount to be exported</span><span>. They are therefore not a perfect record: there are times when the amount ultimately exported is greater or less than the amount on the notification; there are also times when notified exports do not ultimately take place. However, they are the most precise record that exists of the EU’s export trade in banned pesticides.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span>Unearthed </span></i><span>and Public Eye’s analysis is focussed solely on the exports of banned pesticides for “plant protection use” in the importing countries. All exports for biocidal or other non-agricultural uses in the importing country were excluded from the analysis.</span></p>

Their report concluded that 0.03 mg/kg-day was the chronic no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for chlorpyrifos in humans. We demonstrate here that a proper analysis by the original statistical method should have found a lower NOAEL (0.014 mg/kg-day), and that use of statistical methods first available in 1982 would have shown that even the lowest dose in the study had a significant treatment effect,” the researchers report.</p><p id="industry_studies">Furthermore, they wrote, “The original analysis, conducted by Dow-employed statisticians, did not undergo formal peer review; nevertheless, EPA cited the Coulston study as credible research and kept its reported NOAEL as a point of departure for risk assessments throughout much of the 1980′s and 1990′s. During that period, EPA allowed chlorpyrifos to be registered for multiple residential uses that were later cancelled to reduce potential health impacts to children and infants. Had appropriate analyses been employed in the evaluation of this study, it is likely that many of those registered uses of chlorpyrifos would not have been authorized by EPA. This work demonstrates that reliance by pesticide regulators on research results that have not been properly peer-reviewed may needlessly endanger the public.”</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020318602" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">Flawed analysis of an intentional human dosing study and its impact on chlorpyrifos risk assessments</a>.

That’s not entirely surprising. The chemical wasoriginally developedby Nazis during World War II for use as a nerve gas.

<p>There’s a certain simple animation thing that I’ve been using almost since I’ve ever started doing anything related to graphics. I use it for rotating &amp; moving the camera, for moving figures in a turn-based game, for moving UI elements, for smoothing volume changes in <a href="https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/programming/2022/10/15/audio-mixing.html">my audio lib</a>, everywhere! So I decided I’ll write about it. The trick itself is nothing new, - in fact, you’ve probably already heard about or even used it, - but I’ll also show it in some examples and explain how it works mathematically :)</p>

<h2 id="toggle-buttons">Toggle buttons</h2>

<p>Speaking of UI, say you’re making some UI component, maybe a toggle button. Something like this (click it!):</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-none"></canvas></center>




<p>This simply computes the position of the switch as a function of its state:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>turned_on</span> <span>?</span> <span>max_x</span> <span>:</span> <span>min_x</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This works perfectly, but feels a bit lifeless. Adding some <em>animation</em> to it would be cool! Animations are not just a fancy visual thing, they help the user understand what’s going on. Instead of teleporting the toggle indicator to its new position, let’s move it smoothly:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-linear"></canvas></center>




<p>The downside is that we need to run some updating animation now:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>turned_on</span> <span>?</span> <span>1</span> <span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>;</span>
<span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>clamp</span><span>(</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>min_x</span><span>,</span> <span>max_x</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, this still looks a bit clumsy due to having a constant speed (i.e. the position is a <em>linear</em> function of time). Let’s add some <a href="https://easings.net/">easing</a> function on top of that, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep">classic cubic</a> <code>3t^2-2t^3</code>:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-cubic"></canvas></center>




<p>or a square root <code>sqrt(t)</code>:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-sqrt"></canvas></center>




<p>The difference between these may be hard to see, so let’s slow down the animation by a factor of 8:</p>

<center>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><p>Linear:     </p></td><td><center><canvas id="toggle-compare1-linear"></canvas></center></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Cubic:      </p></td><td><center><canvas id="toggle-compare1-cubic"></canvas></center></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Square root:</p></td><td><center><canvas id="toggle-compare1-sqrt"></canvas></center></td><td></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>




<p>This time, instead of just updating the switch position, we have to keep track of some extra animation state:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>t</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>turned_on</span> <span>?</span> <span>1</span> <span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>;</span>
<span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>clamp</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>ease</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>3</span> <span>*</span> <span>t</span> <span>*</span> <span>t</span> <span>-</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>t</span> <span>*</span> <span>t</span> <span>*</span> <span>t</span><span>);</span>
<span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>lerp</span><span>(</span><span>min_x</span><span>,</span> <span>max_x</span><span>,</span> <span>ease</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here, I’m using the fact that <code>smoothstep</code> is symmetric in the following sense: <code>1 - f(t) = f(1 - t)</code>, meaning the forward and backward animations can use the same code. With <code>sqrt</code> things are a bit different: we have to explicitly use a different easing function depending on the animation’s direction:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>ease</span> <span>=</span> <span>turned_on</span> <span>?</span> <span>sqrt</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>sqrt</span><span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>t</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Whichever looks best is arguably a matter of taste, but of all these <code>sqrt</code> is my favourite: the switch starts moving really fast (this is because <code>sqrt</code> has infinite derivative at zero), but then slows down nicely as it reaches the destination (the cubic one is my second favourite, though). The downside of this version is that we need quite a lot of bookkeeping even in the simplest possible case of a two-state toggle button (later in the article I’ll show how this becomes a nightmare in more complicated scenarios). Another downside is that it has a discontinuity: it jumps suddenly if the user clicks on it the middle of animation (try it!).</p>

<p>Thankfully there’s a similar version which uses the minimal possible state and doesn’t have the “jumping” problem:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-exp"></canvas></center>




<p>I call it <em>exponential smoothing</em> (for reasons that will become clear later). I’ve also heard it being called <em>approach</em>, and I’m certain it has it’s own name in every engine. Here it is slowed down 8x and compared to <code>sqrt</code>:</p>

<center>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><p>Square root:</p></td><td><center><canvas id="toggle-compare2-sqrt"></canvas></center></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Exponential:</p></td><td><center><canvas id="toggle-compare2-exp"></canvas></center></td><td></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>




<p>Here’s the code for the exponential version:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>target</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>?</span> <span>max_x</span> <span>:</span> <span>min_x</span><span>);</span>
<span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>target</span> <span>-</span> <span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>exp</span><span>(</span><span>-</span> <span>dt</span> <span>*</span> <span>speed</span><span>));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Intuitively, on each frame we nudge the current position towards its <em>target position</em> (which is determind by the on/off state). However, the amount of nudging <code>(1 - exp(- dt * speed))</code> looks really weird, doesn’t it? Before we see where it comes from, let’s have a look at some more complicated animations.</p>

<h2 id="camera-movement">Camera movement</h2>

<p>Say we have some kind of map, and a camera scrolling/moving around.</p>

<center><canvas id="camera-none"></canvas></center>




<p><em>Yes I’ve made a whole procedural map generator &amp; renderer just for this example, and I have zero regrets.</em></p>

<p>Again, this begs us to add some animation. Let’s interpolate it with constant speed:</p>

<center><canvas id="camera-linear-jitter"></canvas></center>




<p>Here’s the code:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>sign</span><span>(</span><span>target</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>-</span> <span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>;</span>
<span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>sign</span><span>(</span><span>target</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>-</span> <span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>See this jittering after the animation completes? That’s because <code>target.x - position.x</code> keeps alternating between being positive and negative. Instead of <code>sign(delta)</code> we need some function that clamps the delta:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>float</span> <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>float</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span> <span>target</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span> <span>max_delta</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>float</span> <span>delta</span> <span>=</span> <span>target</span> <span>-</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span>
    <span>delta</span> <span>=</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>delta</span><span>,</span>  <span>max_delta</span><span>);</span>
    <span>delta</span> <span>=</span> <span>max</span><span>(</span><span>delta</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>max_delta</span><span>);</span>
    <span>value</span> <span>+=</span> <span>delta</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>update</span><span>(</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>target</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>);</span>
<span>update</span><span>(</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>target</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Quite a mouthful for such a simple thing! And here’s the result:</p>

<center><canvas id="camera-linear"></canvas></center>




<p>Much better, although it’s still a bit clumsy and also weird if we move the camera faster than the animation completes. We could, as before, add some easing function, like the cubic one:</p>

<center><canvas id="camera-cubic"></canvas></center>




<p>although this time it gets really complicated: we have to maintain a queue of requested movement events, and animate them one by one (otherwise I have no idea how to slap the easing function here). This still looks a bit weird when moving the camera fast enough. We could just ignore user’s input while the animation is active, but this is a deadly sin as it is infuriatingly frustrating from the user’s perspective.</p>

<p>The perfect solution? Why, exponential smoothing of course! The code barely changes compared to the toggle button example:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>target</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>-</span> <span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>1.0</span> <span>-</span> <span>exp</span><span>(</span><span>-</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>));</span>
<span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>target</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>-</span> <span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>1.0</span> <span>-</span> <span>exp</span><span>(</span><span>-</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>and here’s how it looks like:</p>

<center><canvas id="camera-exp"></canvas></center>




<p>Pretty nice, if you ask me! Notice how it speeds up naturally if you click fast enough.</p>

<h2 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood</h2>

<p>Ok, so what’s up with this <code>1 - exp(- speed * dt)</code>, what on Earth is that?</p>

<p>Let’s start with a simplified version: we have some animation, it has a current <code>position</code> and the new position <code>target</code> which it must move towards with some <code>speed</code>. To make the movement faster when the difference between <code>position</code> and <code>target</code> is large, we make the speed proportional to this difference:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>target</span> <span>-</span> <span>position</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice how it doesn’t require maintaining <em>any</em> state other than the current and the target position! (<code>speed</code> is usually a constant.) It even doesn’t need to keep track of time that elapsed since the start of the animation, and it adjusts automatically if the <code>target</code> suddenly changes.</p>

<p>Now this already works perfectly in many situations, but there’s a small catch. Here’s the toggle button again, with the above udpate code:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-exp-bad"></canvas></center>




<p>See the jittering? That’s because I’ve set the <code>speed</code> value so high that <code>speed * dt</code> became larger than 1! Specifically, I used <code>speed = 220</code> and <code>dt = 1 / 125</code>.</p>

<p>To understand what’s happening, it is useful to rewrite the code above using <code>lerp</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span> <span>=</span> <span>lerp</span><span>(</span><span>position</span><span>,</span> <span>target</span><span>,</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You can check that this is ultimately the same formula. We can clearly see what’s going on: the formula interpolates between the current value and the target value. The closer the interpolation parameter <code>speed * dt</code> to zero, the slower the interpolation. The closer it is to one, the faster the movement.</p>

<p>Now, what happens when <code>speed * dt</code> is larger than 1 is that the interpolation <em>overshoots</em>! The only reason it still works is that <code>speed * dt</code> is less than 2, so that the <em>absolute</em> delta between <code>position</code> and <code>target</code> still decreases with time. Here’s an example with <code>speed * dt = 248 / 125 &lt; 2</code>:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-exp-bad2"></canvas></center>




<p>and here’s one with <code>speed * dt = 252 / 125 &gt; 2</code>:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-exp-bad3"></canvas></center>




<p>The last one doesn’t do anything useful at all.</p>

<p>To solve this, we could simply clamp the value by 1:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span> <span>=</span> <span>lerp</span><span>(</span><span>position</span><span>,</span> <span>target</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, this doesn’t seem like the right thing to do in all scenarios. Consider why <code>speed * dt</code> might actually happen to be so large?</p>

<p>One reason is that your <code>speed</code> value is too large because you want a really quick animation. However, as we’ve seen with the above toggle buttons, this is actually way too quick for any reasonable user – the actual animation is impossible to notice. So, out <code>speed</code> value is usually not that high.</p>

<p>The other reason is that <code>dt</code> is too large. Maybe because your code runs too slow, and your framerate is dropping. Maybe because the user moved to a different tab/window and your code was sleeping, and now it got woken up with a <code>dt</code> of many seconds.</p>

<p>When applying such a <code>dt</code> to something like physics, you certainly want to clamp it, or subdivide into several updates, etc. With animations, however, wouldn’t it be cool if everything worked perfectly even in this case? Even if your physics might lag, at least the camera &amp; buttons would still work nicely – as a user, I would really appreciate such care.</p>

<h2 id="differential-equations-oh-no">Differential equations (oh no)</h2>

<p>Ok, we want to solve the problem, but how? Here’s the two-step recipe:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Realize that what we’re doing is numerically solving a certain differential equation</li>
  <li>Solve the equation symbolically and use the result directly</li>
</ol>

<p>Time-dependent update that works for small <code>dt</code> but breaks for large <code>dt</code> is pretty typical for numerical solvers of differential equations. What equation does <code>position += (target - position) * speed * dt</code> solve? Whenever you see <code>A += B * dt</code>, this corresponds to an equation</p>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}\frac{d}{dt}A=B"></center>

<p>In our case, the equation is</p>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}\frac{d}{dt}\text{position}%20=%20(\text{target%20-%20position})\cdot\text{speed}"></center>


<p>I will die if I keep typing these formulas with all words spelled out, so let’s make a few variable changes: call <code>x = position</code>, <code>a = target</code>, and <code>c = speed</code>:</p>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}\frac{d}{dt}x%20=%20(a%20-%20x)%20\cdot%20c"></center>


<p>Solving this needs just a few tricks:</p>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}\frac{d}{dt}(x%20-%20a)%20=%20\frac{d}{dt}x%20=%20(a%20-%20x)%20\cdot%20c%20=%20-%20(x%20-%20a)%20\cdot%20c"></center>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}x%20-%20a%20=%20(x_0%20-%20a)\cdot%20\exp(-c\cdot%20t)"></center>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}x%20=%20a%20-%20(a%20-%20x_0)\cdot%20\exp(-c\cdot%20t)"></center>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}x%20=%20x_0%20+%20(a%20-%20x_0)\cdot%20(1%20-%20\exp(-c\cdot%20t)%20)"></center>


<p><em>Btw, a similar exponent appears in e.g. volumetric rendering for pretty similar reasons.</em></p>

<p>It’s not important to understand exactly where this all comes from. The point is that if we believe that <code>position += (target - position) * speed * dt</code> is the right formula for <em>small</em> <code>dt</code>, then the formula <code>position += (target - position) * (1 - exp(- speed * dt))</code> is the right formula to use for <em>any</em> <code>dt</code>. This is further supported by expanding the latter equation in terms of Taylor series for the exponent: <code>exp(x) ~ 1 + x</code>, so that <code>1 - exp(- speed * dt) ~ 1 - (1 - speed * dt) = speed * dt</code>, i.e. we get exactly the former equation.</p>

<p>The cool thing is that it doesn’t care about old values: if you have your previous value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{100}x_0"> and you know how much time has passed between the previous and the current iteration, you can compute the new value. (This is a direct consequence of being a first-order differential equation.)</p>

<p>So, the TL;DR is that <code>position += (target - position) * (1 - exp(- speed * dt))</code>  is the right formula that works for any <code>speed</code> and <code>dt</code>. Even if the product <code>speed * dt</code> is too large, <code>exp(- speed * dt)</code> handles it nicely, since <code>exp</code> of a large negative number is just something close to zero, so <code>1 - exp</code> will be close to one.</p>

<p>We can, as before, rewrite this using <code>lerp</code>: <code>position = lerp(position, target, 1 - exp(- speed * dt))</code> or even <code>position = lerp(target, position, exp(- speed * dt))</code>. There are many ways to rewrite this equtaion.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-the-speed">Choosing the speed</h2>

<p>Usually, we think of animation in terms of its <em>duration</em>. Like, the toggle button should move to the new place in 0.125 seconds (the actual value used in the examples in the beginning of the post), after that it stops moving. With this exponential formula, however, the animation technically takes <em>infinite</em> time to complete! <code>exp(- speed * time)</code> gets smaller with time, but it <em>never</em> equals zero, so that <code>position</code> technically <em>never</em> equals <code>target</code> (provided they were different to start with).</p>

<p>However, in practice we have a ton of limitations. If <code>position</code> is floating-point, it quickly reaches the precision limit, and it becomes equal to <code>target</code> in practice. If it is, say, the camera position, the user probably won’t notice that the animation is still going since the delta <code>target - position</code> gets ridiculously small even before it hits floating-point precision limits.</p>

<p>So, what does the <code>speed</code> parameter mean, exactly? It means the following: <code>1 / speed</code> is the time in which <code>position</code> becomes closer to <code>target</code> by a factor of <code>e = 2.71828...</code> exactly. Do whatever you want with this information.</p>

<p>I usually set the <code>speed</code> to something in the range <code>5..50</code>. For a linear/cubic animation of a certain <code>speed</code>, I usually set the exponential version speed to be <code>2 * speed</code>, this feels about right (again, this is what was used in the examples above).</p>



<p>If you google “exponential smoothing” (or “exponential moving average”), you might find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing">wiki article</a> on something completely unrelated which, nevertheless, features some pretty similar formulas. It actually is the discrete analogue of what we were talking about in this post!</p>

<p>Suppose that our <code>dt</code> is always the same; also suppose that <code>target</code> changes as often as every iteration. Then, indexing the values with the iteration number, we compute something like <code>position[i] = (target[i] - position[i - 1]) * factor</code>, where <code>factor = 1 - exp(- speed * dt)</code>. In this case, one typically sets <code>factor</code> directly to some value between 0 and 1 instead of deriving it from other values (although the aforementioned wiki article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing#Time_constant">does explain</a> what this <code>factor</code> actually means).</p>

<p>People use it in signal processing for the same reasons I do for animations: it doesn’t require maintaining previous values or any other obscure state, just the current averaged value. They also use it in digital audio, where you typically have a fixed <code>dt</code> of <code>1 / freq</code> the inverse sampling frequency (e.g. <code>1/44100</code> or <code>1/48000</code>).</p>

			<p>The creator of the Dragon Ball franchise, Akira Toriyama, has been <a href="https://x.com/DB_official_en/status/1765935471971213816?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> to have passed away on March 1, 2024, due to subdural hematoma at the age of 68.</p>
<p>The rest of the message overviews his accomplishments while also stating that a funeral service was held with his family and very few relatives. The official Dragon Ball account requests that fans do not request interviews from Toriyama’s family, visit them or send items like flowers or condolence gifts. The official account also expressed regret that Toriyama has left several works in the middle of their respective creations, especially given his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>We are deeply saddened to hear about his passing and will always remember him for his legendary contributions to the manga and anime world.</p>

</div><p>The European Space Agency (ESA) Space Debris and Independent Safety Offices are closely monitoring the reentry of a pallet of used ISS batteries and calculating estimates for when and where the reentry will occur.</p><div>
				<p>The batteries, nine in total, were released on 11 January 2021 and will undergo a natural reentry, which is now predicted for around 18:56 CET on&nbsp;8 March +/- 0.4 days.</p><p>The total mass of the batteries is estimated at 2.6 metric tonnes, most of which may burn up during the reentry. While some parts may reach the ground, the casualty risk – the likelihood of a person being hit – is very low.</p><p>The reentry will occur between -51.6 degrees South and 51.6 degrees North. Large uncertainties, primarily driven by fluctuating levels of atmospheric drag, prevent more precise predictions at this time.

<p dir="auto">It annoys me to no end when a web application prevents me from being able to
paste content into an input field, or copy it out.  If I paste an incorrect
email address, that's my own damn fault.  I use tools like 1Password to

<p dir="auto">The easiest way to add a site to the blacklist is to click on the extension

<p dir="auto">Version 2 is a major update to the extension. It makes it much easier to ensure
the extension is only running on sites that are bad actors with copy &amp; paste
events and it also provides visibility into the active/inactive state of the
extension for each tab.</p>
<p dir="auto">In order to provide the smoothest experience as possible, the extension needs
to know when you change active tabs. In order for the extension to know about
that event, it needs the <code>tabs</code> permission, which Chrome describes as "can read
and change all your data on websites you visit." That description is very
scary, and is certainly not what this extension is doing. Being an open-sourced
project, you can always read all the code to see how this extension works, and
what it's [not] doing with your data.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <p>
    annas-blog.org, 2022-10-17 (translations: <a href="https://saveweb.othing.xyz/blog/2022/11/12/%e5%a6%82%e4%bd%95%e6%88%90%e4%b8%ba%e6%b5%b7%e7%9b%97%e6%a1%a3%e6%a1%88%e5%ad%98%e6%a1%a3%e8%80%85/">中文 [zh]</a>)
  </p>
  <p>
    Before we dive in, two updates on the Pirate Library Mirror (EDIT: moved to Anna’s Archive):<br>
    1. We got some extremely generous donations. The first was $10k from the anonymous individual who also has been supporting "bookwarrior", the original founder of Library Genesis. Special thanks to bookwarrior for facilitating this donation. The second was another $10k from an anonymous donor, who got in touch after our last release, and was inspired to help. We also had a number of smaller donations. Thanks so much for all your generous support. We have some exciting new projects in the pipeline which this will support, so stay tuned.<br>
    2. We had some technical difficulties with the size of our second release, but our torrents are up and seeding now. We also got a generous offer from an anonymous individual to seed our collection on their very-high-speed servers, so we're doing a special upload to their machines, after which everyone else who is downloading the collection should see a large improvement in speed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Entire books can be written about the <em>why</em> of digital preservation in general, and pirate archivism in particular, but let us give a quick primer for those who are not too familiar. The world is producing more knowledge and culture than ever before, but also more of it is being lost than ever before. Humanity largely entrusts corporations like academic publishers, streaming services, and social media companies with this heritage, and they have often not proven to be great stewards. Check out the documentary Digital Amnesia, or really any talk by Jason Scott.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are some institutions that do a good job archiving as much as they can, but they are bound by the law. As pirates, we are in a unique position to archive collections that they cannot touch, because of copyright enforcement or other restrictions. We can also mirror collections many times over, across the world, thereby increasing the chances of proper preservation.
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, we won't get into discussions about the pros and cons of intellectual property, the morality of breaking the law, musings on censorship, or the issue of access to knowledge and culture. With all that out of the way, let's dive into the <em>how</em>. We'll share how our team became pirate archivists, and the lessons that we learned along the way. There are many challenges when you embark on this journey, and hopefully we can help you through some of them.
  </p>
  <p><img src="https://annas-blog.org/party-guy.png"></p><h2>Community</h2>
  <p>
    The first challenge might be a surprising one. It is not a technical problem, or a legal problem. It is a psychological problem: doing this work in the shadows can be incredibly lonely. Depending on what you're planning to do, and your threat model, you might have to be very careful. On the one end of the spectrum we have people like Alexandra Elbakyan*, the founder of Sci-Hub, who is very open about her activities. But she is at high risk of being arrested if she would visit a western country at this point, and could face decades of prison time. Is that a risk you would be willing to take? We are at the other end of the spectrum; being very careful not to leave any trace, and having strong operational security.
  </p>
  <p>
    * As mentioned on HN by "ynno", Alexandra initially didn't want to be known: "Her servers were set up to emit detailed error messages from PHP, including full path of faulting source file, which was under directory /home/ringo-ring, which could be traced to a username she had online on an unrelated site, attached to her real name. Before this revelation, she was anonymous." So, use random usernames on the computers you use for this stuff, in case you misconfigure something.
  </p>
  <p>
    That secrecy, however, comes with a psychological cost. Most people love being recognized for the work that they do, and yet you cannot take any credit for this in real life. Even simple things can be challenging, like friends asking you what you have been up to (at some point "messing with my NAS / homelab" gets old).
  </p>
  <p>
    This is why it is so important to find some community. You can give up some operational security by confiding in some very close friends, who you know you can trust deeply. Even then be careful not to put anything in writing, in case they have to turn over their emails to the authorities, or if their devices are compromised in some other manner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Better still is to find some fellow pirates. If your close friends are interested in joining you, great! Otherwise, you might be able to find others online. Sadly this is still a niche community. So far we have found only a handful of others who are active in this space. Good starting places seem to be the Library Genesis forums, and r/DataHoarder. The Archive Team also has likeminded individuals, though they operate within the law (even if in some grey areas of the law). The traditional "warez" and pirating scenes also have folks who think in similar ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are open to ideas on how to foster community and explore ideas. Feel free to message us on Twitter or Reddit. Perhaps we could host some sort of forum or chat group. One challenge is that this can easily get censored when using common platforms, so we would have to host it ourselves. There is also a tradeoff between having these discussions fully public (more potential engagement) versus making it private (not letting potential "targets" know that we're about to scrape them). We'll have to think about that. Let us know if you are interested in this!
  </p>
  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>
    When we do a project, it has a couple of phases:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Domain selection / philosophy: Where do you roughly want to focus on, and why? What are your unique passions, skills, and circumstances that you can use to your benefit?</li>
    <li>Target selection: Which specific collection will you mirror?</li>
    <li>Metadata scraping: Cataloging information about the files, without actually downloading the (often much larger) files themselves.</li>
    <li>Data selection: Based on the metadata, narrowing down which data is most relevant to archive right now. Could be everything, but often there is a reasonable way to save space and bandwidth.</li>
    <li>Data scraping: Actually getting the data.</li>
    <li>Distribution: Packaging it up in torrents, announcing it somewhere, getting people to spread it.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    These are not completely independent phases, and often insights from a later phase send you back to an earlier phase. For example, during metadata scraping you might realize that the target that you selected has defensive mechanisms beyond your skill level (like IP blocks), so you go back and find a different target.
  </p>
  <h3>1. Domain selection / philosophy</h3>
  <p>
    There is no shortage of knowledge and cultural heritage to be saved, which can be overwhelming. That's why it's often useful to take a moment and think about what your contribution can be.
  </p>
  <p>
    Everyone has a different way of thinking about this, but here are some questions that you could ask yourself:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Why are you interested in this? What are you passionate about? If we can get a bunch of people who all archive the kinds of things that they specifically care about, that would cover a lot! You will know a lot more than the average person about your passion, like what is important data to save, what are the best collections and online communities, and so on.</li>
    <li>What skills do you have that you can use to your benefit? For example, if you are an online security expert, you can find ways of defeating IP blocks for secure targets. If you are great at organizing communities, then perhaps you can rally some people together around a goal. It is useful to know some programming though, if only for keeping good operational security throughout this process.</li>
    <li>How much time do you have for this? Our advice would be to start small and doing bigger projects as you get the hang of it, but it can get all-consuming.</li>
    <li>What would be a high-leverage area to focus on? If you're going to spend X hours on pirate archiving, then how can you get the biggest "bang for your buck"?</li>
    <li>What are unique ways that you are thinking about this? You might have some interesting ideas or approaches that others might have missed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In our case, we cared in particular about the long term preservation of science. We knew about Library Genesis, and how it was fully mirrored many times over using torrents. We loved that idea. Then one day, one of us tried to find some scientific textbooks on Library Genesis, but couldn't find them, bringing into doubt how complete it really was. We then searched those textbooks online, and found them in other places, which planted the seed for our project. Even before we knew about the Z-Library, we had the idea of not trying to collect all those books manually, but to focus on mirroring existing collections, and contributing them back to Library Genesis.
  </p>
  <h3>2. Target selection</h3>
  <p>
    So, we have our area that we are looking at, now which specific collection do we mirror? There are a couple of things that make for a good target:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Large</li>
    <li>Unique: not already well-covered by other projects.</li>
    <li>Accessible: does not use tons of layers of protection to prevent you from scraping their metadata and data.</li>
    <li>Special insight: you have some special information about this target, like you somehow have special access to this collection, or you figured out how to defeat their defenses. This is not required (our upcoming project does not do anything special), but it certainly helps!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When we found our science textbooks on websites other than Library Genesis, we tried to figure out how they made their way onto the internet. We then found the Z-Library, and realized that while most books don't first make their appearance there, they do eventually end up there. We learned about its relationship to Library Genesis, and the (financial) incentive structure and superior user interface, both of which made it a much more complete collection. We then did some preliminary metadata and data scraping, and realized that we could get around their IP download limits, leveraging one of our members' special access to lots of proxy servers.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you're exploring different targets, it is already important to hide your tracks by using VPNs and throwaway email addresses, which we'll talk about more later.
  </p>
  <h3>3. Metadata scraping</h3>
  <p>
    Let's get a bit more technical here. For actually scraping the metadata from websites, we have kept things pretty simple. We use Python scripts, sometimes curl, and a MySQL database to store the results in. We haven't used any fancy scraping software which can map complex websites, since so far we only needed to scrape one or two kinds of pages by just enumerating through ids and parsing the HTML. If there aren't easily enumerated pages, then you might need a proper crawler that tries to find all pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before you start scraping a whole website, try doing it manually for a bit. Go through a few dozen pages yourself, to get a sense for how that works. Sometimes you will already run into IP blocks or other interesting behavior this way. The same goes for data scraping: before getting too deep into this target, make sure you can actually download its data effectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    To get around restrictions, there are a few things you can try. Are there any other IP addresses or servers that host the same data but do not have the same restrictions? Are there any API endpoints that do not have restrictions, while others do? At what rate of downloading does your IP get blocked, and for how long? Or are you not blocked but throttled down? What if you create a user account, how do things change then? Can you use HTTP/2 to keep connections open, and does that increase the rate at which you can request pages? Are there pages that list multiple files at once, and is the information listed there sufficient?
  </p>
  <p>
    Things you probably want to save include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Title</li>
    <li>Filename / location</li>
    <li>ID: can be some internal ID, but IDs like ISBN or DOI are useful too.</li>
    <li>Size: to calculate how much disk space you need.</li>
    <li>Hash (md5, sha1): to confirm that you downloaded the file properly.</li>
    <li>Date added/modified: so you can come back later and download files that you didn't download before (though you can often also use the ID or hash for this).</li>
    <li>Description, category, tags, authors, language, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We typically do this in two stages. First we download the raw HTML files, usually directly into MySQL (to avoid lots of small files, which we talk more about below). Then, in a separate step, we go through those HTML files and parse them into actual MySQL tables. This way you don't have to re-download everything from scratch if you discover a mistake in your parsing code, since you can just reprocess the HTML files with the new code. It's also often easier to parallelize the processing step, thus saving some time (and you can write the processing code while the scraping is running, instead of having to write both steps at once).
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, note that for some targets metadata scraping is all there is. There are some huge metadata collections out there that aren't properly preserved.
  </p>
  <h3>4. Data selection</h3>
  <p>
    Often you can use the metadata to figure out a reasonable subset of data to download. Even if you eventually want to download all the data, it can be useful to prioritize the most important items first, in case you get detected and defences are improved, or because you would need to buy more disks, or simply because something else comes up in your life before you can download everything.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a collection might have multiple editions of the same underlying resource (like a book or a film), where one is marked as being the best quality. Saving those editions first would make a lot of sense. You might eventually want to save all editions, since in some cases the metadata might be tagged incorrectly, or there might be unknown tradeoffs between editions (for example, the "best edition" might be best in most ways but worse in other ways, like a film having a higher resolution but missing subtitles).
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also search your metadata database to find interesting things. What is the biggest file that is hosted, and why is it so big? What is the smallest file? Are there interesting or unexpected patterns when it comes to certain categories, languages, and so on? Are there duplicate or very similar titles? Are there patterns to when data was added, like one day in which many files were added at once? You can often learn a lot by looking at the dataset in different ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    In our case, we deduplicated Z-Library books against the md5 hashes in Library Genesis, thereby saving a lot of download time and disk space. This is a pretty unique situation though. In most cases there are no comprehensive databases of which files are already properly preserved by fellow pirates. This in itself is a huge opportunity for someone out there. It would be great to have a regularly updated overview of things like music and films that are already widely seeded on torrent websites, and are therefore lower priority to include in pirate mirrors.
  </p>
  <h3>5. Data scraping</h3>
  <p>
    Now you're ready to actually download the data in bulk. As mentioned before, at this point you should already manually have downloaded a bunch of files, to better understand the  behavior and restrictions of the target. However, there will still be surprises in store for you once you actually get to downloading lots of files at once.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our advice here is mainly to keep it simple. Start by just downloading a bunch of files. You can use Python, and then expand to multiple threads. But sometimes even simpler is to generate Bash files directly from the database, and then running multiple of them in multiple terminal windows to scale up. A quick technical trick worth mentioning here is using OUTFILE in MySQL, which you can write anywhere if you disable "secure_file_priv" in mysqld.cnf (and be sure to also disable/override AppArmor if you're on Linux).
  </p>
  <p>
    We store the data on simple hard disks. Start out with whatever you have, and expand slowly. It can be overwhelming to think about storing hundreds of TBs of data. If that is the situation that you're facing, just put out a good subset first, and in your announcement ask for help in storing the rest. If you do want to get more hard drives yourself, then r/DataHoarder has some good resources on getting good deals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Try not to worry too much about fancy filesystems. It is easy to fall into the rabbit hole of setting up things like ZFS. One technical detail to be aware of though, is that many filesystems don't deal well with lots of files. We've found that a simple workaround is to create multiple directories, e.g. for different ID ranges or hash prefixes.
  </p>
  <p>
    After downloading the data, be sure to check the integrity of the files using hashes in the metadata, if available.
  </p>
  <h3>6. Distribution</h3>
  <p>
    You have the data, thereby giving you possession of the world's first pirate mirror of your target (most likely). In many ways the hardest part is over, but the riskiest part is still ahead of you. After all, so far you've been stealth; flying under the radar. All you had to do was using a good VPN throughout, not filling in your personal details in any forms (duh), and perhaps using a special browser session (or even a different computer).
  </p>
  <p>
    Now you have to distribute the data. In our case we first wanted to contribute the books back to Library Genesis, but then quickly discovered the difficulties in that (fiction vs non-fiction sorting). So we decided on distribution using Library Genesis-style torrents. If you have the opportunity to contribute to an existing project, then that could save you a lot of time. However, there are not many well-organized pirate mirrors out there currently.
  </p>
  <p>
     So let's say you decide on distributing torrents yourself. Try to keep those files small, so they are easy to mirror on other websites. You will then have to seed the torrents yourself, while still staying anonymous. You can use a VPN (with or without port forwarding), or pay with tumbled Bitcoins for a Seedbox. If you don't know what some of those terms mean, you'll have a bunch of reading to do, since it's important that you understand the risk tradeoffs here.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can host the torrent files themselves on existing torrent websites. In our case, we chose to actually host a website, since we also wanted to spread our philosophy in a clear way. You can do this yourself in a similar manner (we use Njalla for our domains and hosting, paid for with tumbled Bitcoins), but also feel free to contact us to have us host your torrents. We are looking to build a comprehensive index of pirate mirrors over time, if this idea catches on.
  </p>
  <p>
    As for VPN selection, much has been written about this already, so we'll just repeat the general advice of choosing by reputation. Actual court-tested no-log policies with long track records of protecting privacy is the lowest risk option, in our opinion. Note that even when you do everything right, you can never get to zero risk. For example, when seeding your torrents, a highly motivated nation-state actor can probably look at incoming and outgoing data flows for VPN servers, and deduce who you are. Or you can just simply mess up somehow. We probably already have, and will again. Luckily, nation states don't care <em>that</em> much about piracy.
  </p>
  <p>
    One decision to make for each project, is whether to publish it using the same identity as before, or not. If you keep using the same name, then mistakes in operational security from earlier projects could come back to bite you. But publishing under different names means that you don't build a longer lasting reputation. We chose to have strong operational security from the start so we can keep using the same identity, but we won't hesitate to publish under a different name if we mess up or if the circumstances call for it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Getting the word out can be tricky. As we said, this is still a niche community. We originally posted on Reddit, but really got traction on Hacker News. For now our recommendation is to post it in a few places and see what happens. And again, contact us. We would love to spread the word of more pirate archivism efforts.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Hopefully this is helpful for newly starting pirate archivists. We're excited to welcome you to this world, so don't hesitate to reach out. Let's preserve as much of the world's knowledge and culture as we can, and mirror it far and wide.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks" id="incArticle"><p>Many of us lament the disappearance of buttons in car interiors, in favor of screens and touch-sensitive controls. For automakers, these physical inputs cost money, so it's no secret why they're largely disappearing. Those of us who appreciate buttons know they're convenient to find just by feel, without averting your attention from the road. <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/39304/why-im-done-pretending-touchscreen-infotainment-isnt-a-stupid-hazardous-fad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">That's an obvious boon to safety</a>, and it seems that in about two years, European evaluators will start treating it as such. For manufacturers to receive the best possible European New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) safety rating from that point on, they'll need to incorporate a minimum of physical inputs for key functions.</p><p>Before we get ahead of ourselves, there's unfortunately nothing in the criteria that stipulates that frequently adjusted controls, like those for the HVAC system or basic media functions, must happen off a touchscreen. Here, Euro NCAP seems primarily concerned with safety-critical functions. As <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/5/24091043/euro-ncap-safety-rating-europe-2026-touchscreen-buttons-dials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a></em> quotes from <em>The Times</em> of London, "cars will need to use buttons, dials, or stalks for hazard warning lights, indicators, windscreen wipers, SOS calls, and the horn."</p><p>Fortunately, I can't remember the last time I drove a car that relied upon capacitive inputs for any of those things. It's not the sweeping change most of us would prefer, but it's a start. Of course, <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/tesla-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla</a> is famous for relegating turn signals to touch-sensitive operation, which <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-fans-complain-new-model-3-highland-turn-signal-stalks-2023-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most people seem to hate</a>. If this move makes the world's most popular EV a little easier to operate for those behind the wheel, that'll also make it safer for the rest of us on the road. Personally, I'm OK with that.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">The 2025 Volkswagen GTI's updated interior features hard buttons on the steering wheel. <em>Volkswagen</em></span></figure><p>Now, it's worth mentioning that the Euro NCAP regime is totally voluntary, and not compulsory by law. In that sense, it's sort of like the testing conducted by the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/full-size-pickup-trucks-are-terrible-at-protecting-rear-passengers-iihs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insurance Institute for Highway Safety</a> here in the U.S. That said, plenty of automakers love to advertise their IIHS marks when they're favorable, especially as the IIHS has much more stringent criteria than our National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, whose regulations are mired in decades-old legislation. And it stands to reason that adjustments made for other regions will likely trickle over to our own, when possible, to avoid duplication of expense. When you've already engineered a turn signal stalk, why ditch it for particular markets? Unless you have <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/41324/teslas-yoke-and-touchscreen-shifter-look-like-a-parking-lot-disaster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a philosophical objection to common sense</a>, that is.</p><p>This step may not fix modern automotive interiors overnight, but it also won't hurt. It happens to mirror many car companies' own initiatives to reintroduce buttons and physical inputs back into their cars, to win back frustrated customers. <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/2025-vw-gti-brings-buttons-gains-20-hp-ditches-the-manual" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Volkswagen is doing it with the new GTI</a> and Golf R, swapping out the annoying Mk8 steering wheel with its fully touch-sensitive controls for one that is all hard keys. Hyundai, too, has <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/hyundai-promises-to-keep-buttons-in-cars-because-touchscreen-controls-are-dangerous" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vowed to fight the good fight</a>.
