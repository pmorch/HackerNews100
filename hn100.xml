            <p>After I wrote my <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/">last post</a> on how .NET builds and ships, I was cautiously optimistic that I wouldn’t be writing another one. Or at least not another one about how we build and ship. That problem was done and dusted. .NET had done it! We’d struck a balance between distributed repository development and the ability to quickly compose a product for shipping. Congratulations everyone, now the infrastructure teams could focus on other things. Security, cross-company standardization, support for building new product features. All the good stuff.</p>
<p><em>…A year and a half later…</em></p>
<p>We’re asking how much it will cost to build 3-4 major versions with a dozen .NET SDK bands between them each month. And keep their engineering systems up to date. And hey, there’s this late breaking fix we want to get into next week’s release, so can I check it in today and have the team validate tonight? It can’t be <strong>that</strong> hard, right? And I have this new cross-stack feature that I want to do some prototyping on…how can I build it?</p>
<p>The answers were mostly frustrating:</p>
<p><em>“It’ll cost a lot, and get worse over time.</em>“</p>
<p>“<em>I don’t think we have enough time for that fix, I can only guess how long the build will take, but it’s at least 36 hours before we can handoff to validation. Maybe more?</em>“</p>
<p>“<em>I’m sure we can keep that much infrastructure alive, but we’ll slowly drown under the cost of keeping it up to date.</em>“</p>
<p>“<em>How critical is it that you have a full stack to work with? It’ll take a while to set that up.</em>“</p>
<p>These are <strong>not</strong> the answers we want to be giving. And so, we went back to the drawing board, looking for solutions.</p>
<p>This blog post is about the Unified Build project: .NET’s effort to resolve many of these issues by moving product construction into a ‘virtual monolithic’ repository, consolidating the build into a series of ‘vertical builds’, while still enabling contributors to work outside the monolith. I’ll briefly tell the story of our product construction journey over the life of .NET. I’ll draw attention to the lessons we’ve learned about applying a distributed product construction model to a single product, particularly its drawbacks in overhead and complexity. Finally, I’ll dig into the details of Unified Build and its foundational technology, Linux distro Source Build. We’ll look at the new method of product construction and the results we’re seeing.</p>
<h2>How did we get here? This is not my beautiful build infrastructure</h2>
<p>.NET was born out of the closed source infrastructure of the .NET Framework and Silverlight in 2015-2016. It was made open source incrementally as we readied its components for external consumption, and as was the fashion at the time, we split it into multiple repositories. CoreCLR represented the base runtime, CoreFX the libraries, Core-Setup the packaging and installation. Along came ASP.NET Core and EntityFramework Core, and an SDK with a CLI. A few releases saw major revamps of the product in the form of shared frameworks, with WindowsDesktop joining the fold. More repositories and more complexity.</p>
<p>What is important to understand is that .NET is a product that is developed in separate inter-dependent repositories but needs to be composed together in a relatively short period of time to ship. On paper, the ‘graph’ of the product looks much like any open source ecosystem. A repository produces some software component, publishes it to public registries, and downstream consumers take a dependency on the new component, and publish their own updates. It’s a producer-consumer model where changes ripple through the ‘global’ dependency graph via a series of pull-&gt;build-&gt;publish operations. This model is highly distributed and effective, but it is not necessarily efficient in a time sense. It enables software vendors and repository owners to have significant autonomy over their process and schedules. However, attempting to apply this methodology to a product like .NET, which represents its components using separate, but inter-dependent repositories, has major drawbacks.</p>
<p>Let’s call this a “distributed product construction methodology”. To get a sense of why it can be a difficult methodology to use, let’s take a look at the process to produce a security release.</p>
<h3>Example: Security Servicing</h3>
<p>Consider shipping a security patch. A security vulnerability is discovered somewhere in the .NET Runtime libraries. Because .NET is descended from .NET Framework, let’s say this security vulnerability is also present in .NET Framework 4.7.2. It becomes absolutely vital that .NET’s security update goes out in tandem with the .NET Framework update, or one will zero-day the other. .NET has numerous Microsoft-managed release paths. Microsoft Update, our CDN, Linux and container package registries, nuget.org, Visual Studio, Azure Marketplace, and on and on. That puts some restrictions on timeline. We need to be able to be predictable.</p>
<p>.NET’s development structure looks a lot like a typical open source ecosystem. The .NET Runtime, the .NET SDK, ASP.NET Core and the WindowsDesktop shared framework are developed by different teams, though with a huge amount of cross-collaboration. They are developed, at times, like independent products. The .NET Runtime forms the base of the product. ASP.NET Core and WindowsDesktop are built on top of that. A huge quantity of the dev tooling (C#, F#, MSBuild) is built on top of the surface area of the .NET Runtime and some auxiliary libraries. The SDK gathers up and builds a CLI, along with tasks, targets and tooling. Much of the shared framework and tooling content is redistributed in-box.</p>
<p>To build and ship this security patch, we need coordination between the many teams that contribute to the .NET product as a whole. We need the lowest levels of the .NET graph (see below) to build their assets, then feed them downstream to consumers. They need take the update, build, and feed downstream. This will happen continually until the product is “coherent”; no new changes are being fed into the graph and everyone agrees on a single version of each component in the product. Coherency ensures that a component with changes is ingested everywhere that redistributes the component, or information about it. Then, we want to do our validation, take all the shippable assets from the closure of all those unreleased components, and then release them all at once to the world.</p>
<p>This is a lot of moving parts that need to work well together in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Distributes Ecosystems</h3>
<p>It’s important to note that this distributed ecosystem style of development <em>does</em> have a lot of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Layering</strong> – Repository boundaries tend to encourage layering and less tightly bound products. During the major version development lifecycle, the individual components of the stack generally remain roughly compatible, even as changes flow quickly and unevenly through the graph.</li>
<li><strong>Communities</strong> – Repository boundaries tend to encourage good, focused communities. The WPF and Winforms communities, for instance, are often distinct. Small repos are also generally more approachable.,</li>
<li><strong>Incrementality</strong> – Distributed development often allows for incremental changes. For instance, we can make breaking changes to the System.CommandLine surface area, then ingest those in the consumers over time. This doesn’t work all the time (e.g. let’s say the SDK is attempting to ship just one copy of System.Text.Json for all of the tooling to use, but not every consumer agrees on that surface area. Boom?!), but it’s reasonably reliable.</li>
<li><strong>Tight Inner Loops</strong> – Smaller, focused repositories tend to have better inner-loop experiences. Even something as simple as <code>git clone</code> or <code>git pull</code> is faster in a small repository. The repository boundary tends to give the (possibly illusory) sense that for your change, you only need to worry about the code and tests you can see.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous development</strong> – Incrementality helps development be more asynchronous. If my component flows to three downstream consumers who work in three different time zones, those teams can make progress on their own components in their own time, rather than needing to coordinate.</li>
<li><strong>Low-Cost Sharding/Incremental Builds</strong> – Distributed development allows for ‘optimizing’ away builds of components that don’t change every often and are at the fringes of a dependency graph. For instance, a leaf node that builds some static test assets doesn’t need to be rebuilt every time there is a change to the sdk. The last built assets are just fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you squint and peer between the lines here though, a lot of the advantages of the distributed model are its significant weaknesses when we need to build and ship software that requires changes in a significant portion of the graph to be completed in a short period of time. Changes at scale across large graphs are often slow and unpredictable. But why? Is there something inherently wrong with this model? Not really. In typical OSS ecosystems (e.g. NuGet or NodeJS package ecosystems), these aspects are often <strong>not a problem</strong>. These ecosystems do not optimize for speed or predictability. Instead, they value the autonomy of each node. Each node needs only to concern itself with what it needs to <em>produce</em> and what it needs to <em>consume</em> and the changes required to meet those needs. However, when we attempt to apply the distributed model to shipping software quickly, we often struggle because it increases the prevalence of two key concepts, which I’m calling <strong>Product Construction Complexity</strong> and <strong>Product Construction Overhead</strong>. Together these combine to slow us down and make us less predictable.</p>
<h4>Product Construction Complexity</h4>
<p>In the context of product construction, ‘complexity’ refers to the quantity of steps that are required for a change to go from a developer’s machine to that change being delivered to customers in all the ways that it needs to be delivered. I recognize that this is a fairly abstract definition. “Step” could mean different things depending on what level of granularity you want to look at. For now, let’s focus on conceptual product construction steps, as shown in the example graph below:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/basic-product-construction-complexity-scaled.webp" alt="Basic product construction complexity">
<em>A simple multi-repository product construction workflow. MyLibrary and MyApp are built from separate codebases. MyApp deploys to two customer endpoints</em></p>
<p>.NET began with a relatively simple product dependency graph and matching tools to manage that graph. As it grew, new repositories were added to the graph and additional dependency flow was required to construct the product. The graph grew more complex. We invented new tools (Maestro, our dependency flow system) to manage it. It was now easier than ever to add new dependencies. A developer or team looking to add new functionality to the product could often just create a new repository and build and set up the inputs and outputs. They only needed to know how that component fit within a small subsection of the larger product construction graph in order to add a new node. However, .NET doesn’t ship each individual unit independently. The product must become “coherent”, where everyone agrees on the versions of their dependencies, in order to ship. Dependencies or metadata about them are redistributed. You have to “visit” all of the edges. <em>Note: While we do not need to rev every component in the graph, there is a significant portion that changes on every release, either due to fixes or dependency flow.</em> Then you take the outputs of each individual node, combine them all together, and out the door you go.</p>
<p>More complex graphs have significant downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>The more edges and nodes, the longer it tends to take to achieve coherency.</li>
<li>Teams are more likely to make a mistake. There are more coordination points, and more points in the workflow where a human can influence an outcome. Tools can help, but they only go so far.</li>
<li>Complexity can also encourage variance in build environment and requirements. It’s hard to keep everyone aligned on the same processes as teams move and upgrade at different rates. Reproducing that full set of environments can be expensive, and that cost tends to increase over time as infrastructure “rots”.</li>
</ul>

<em>Small but critical subsection of the .NET product construction graph, circa .NET Core 3.1. Arcade provides shared build infrastructure (dotted lines), while solid lines show component dependencies. Changes ripple through multiple repositories before reaching the final SDK and installer.</em></p>
<h4>Product Construction Overhead</h4>
<p>We define overhead as “<em>the amount of time spent not actively producing artifacts that we can ship to customers</em>“. Like complexity, it can be evaluated on a different level of granularity depending on how detailed you want to get. Let’s take a look at two quick examples, and then at the overhead in one of .NET’s older builds.</p>
<p>A simple multi-repo product construction process might look like the following:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/basic-product-construction-overhead-scaled.webp" alt="Sample product construction overhead">
<em>Illustration of overhead in a simple multi-repo product-construction workflow. Dot-outlined nodes represent overhead.</em></p>
<p>In the above graph, the overhead nodes (dotted nodes) do not actively contribute to the production of the packages in D. The time it takes the dependency flow service to create the PR is overhead. Waiting for a dev to notice and review the PR is overhead. Waiting for approval for package push is overhead. That’s not to say that these steps aren’t <em>necessary</em>, just that they are places where we say we’re not actively creating outputs for customers.</p>
<p>How about builds? If we zoom into a repository build process, we can often see quite a lot of overhead. Consider this very simple build:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/basic-pipeline-build-overhead-scaled.webp" alt="Sample pipeline overhead">
<em>Illustration of overhead in a simple pipeline. Dot-outlined nodes represent overhead. Again, there are a number of steps here that aren’t actively producing or shipping bits to customers. They may be <strong>necessary</strong>, but they’re still overhead.</em></p>
<p>There are a few interesting measures of overhead in a system. We can measure it a % of overall time. Add up the time spent in each step based on its classification, then divide the total overhead by the total time. This gives a nice measure of overall resource efficiency. However, from a wall clock perspective, overall overhead doesn’t tell us much. To understand overhead’s effect on the end-to-end time, we find the longest path by time through our product construction graph, then compute the total overhead in steps that contribute to that path as compared to the total time in the path.</p>
<p>To understand what that overhead might look like in a single .NET build, let’s take a look at an 8.0 build of runtime. This data was generated using a custom tool that can evaluate an Azure DevOps build based on a set of patterns that classify each step.</p>

<h4>Overhead + Complexity = Time</h4>
<p>Overhead is unavoidable. There is some level inherent in every product construction process. However, when we add complexity to our product construction processes, especially complexity in the graph, the overhead tends to begin to dominate the process. It sort of multiplies. Rather than paying the machine queue time cost one time, you might pay it 10 times over within a single path through the graph. After those machines are allocated, you then clone the repo each time. The efficiency scaling of these steps tends to also be worse because there is some fixed cost associated with each one. For instance, if it takes 10 seconds to scan 10MB of artifacts, and 1 second to prepare for the scan, collate and upload the results, it takes longer to do that step 10 times in a row than it does to scan the full 100MB at once. 110 vs. 101 seconds.</p>
<p>What is also insidious is that this cost tends to hide and increase over time. It’s not always obvious. A local repository build for a developer is typically fast. The developer does not see any overhead of the overall CI system in that build. Zooming out, building the repository in a job in a pipeline can be similarly quick, but starts to incur some overhead. You have the quick build of that repository, but extra overhead steps around it. You’re still reasonably efficient though. Then let’s say you zoom out a little and you have some additional jobs in that pipeline, doing other things. Maybe reusing artifacts from other parts of the build, building containers, etc. Overhead will start to become a larger overall % of the long path time. Now, zoom out again, and you’re looking at the place of that pipeline and associated repositories in context of your larger product construction. You add in time for dev PR approvals, dependency flow systems to do their work, more cloning, more building, more compliance, more more more.</p>
<p>In a distributed product construction system, decisions that affect complexity, and therefore overhead, can be made at a level that does not see the overall overhead in the system. A new node is added. In isolation, it’s fine. In context, it costs.</p>
<p>While no graph of complexity was ever made for the .NET 8 timeframe that could show the complexity of each individual component build in context of the whole product construction graph, consider what the job graph for the runtime build alone looked like. Each bubble below represents a separate machine.</p>

<em>Complexity in a .NET 8 build. Each node represents an individual machine. Edges represent dependencies.</em></p>
<h2>The roots of Unified Build in Source Build</h2>
<p>.NET Source Build is a way that Linux distributions can build .NET in an isolated environment from a single, unified source layout. Microsoft started working on it around .NET Core 1.1. The spiritual roots of Unified Build grew from hallway conversations between the team working on .NET Source Build and the team responsible for the Microsoft distribution. I won’t say it wasn’t in jealousy that the infrastructure teams often looked at how long it took to build the .NET product within the Source Build infrastructure. <strong>50 minutes!</strong> Shorter than it took to build just the runtime repository from scratch in its official CI build. Now granted, it wasn’t exactly an apples-to-apples comparison. After all, Source Build:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only builds one platform.</li>
<li>Doesn’t build any of the Windows-only assets (e.g. WindowsDesktop shared framework)/</li>
<li>Doesn’t build .NET workloads.</li>
<li>Doesn’t do any installer packaging.</li>
<li>Doesn’t build the tests by default</li>
</ul>
<p>All very reasonable caveats. But enough caveats to add up to 10s of hours in differences in build time? <strong>Unlikely.</strong> Much more likely is that the Source Build methodology is <strong>low complexity</strong> and <strong>low overhead</strong>. More than just time, there were other obvious benefits. Unified toolsets, easier cross-stack development, and perhaps most importantly, hard guarantees of what was being built and its build-time dependencies.</p>
<p>Back to those hallway conversations. Source Build’s obvious benefits led to occasional probing questions from various members of the .NET team. Most of the form: <em>So…why doesn’t Microsoft build its distribution that way?</em> Answer: It’s hard.</p>
<h3>Why is it hard? A detour into the land of Source Build</h3>
<p>Microsoft began efforts to make Source Build a ‘real’ piece of machinery around the .NET 3.1 timeframe. Prior to this point, the Source Build distribution tended to look more like a one-off effort for each .NET major release. It was too difficult to keep working all the time, so the team worked, starting in the spring as the new product took shape, to bring the new .NET version into line with Linux distro maintainer requirements. To understand why it’s so hard to fit Microsoft’s distribution of .NET into this model as part of the Unified Build project, let’s look back into why it was so hard to get the Source Build project into a turn crank state in the first place.</p>
<p>To allow our distro partners to distribute .NET we needed to produce an infrastructure system that produced a .NET SDK within the following constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single implementation! – Only one implementation per component</li>
<li>Single platform – Only build for one platform (the one that distro partners are trying to ship)</li>
<li>Single build – Only build on one machine. We can’t require a complex orchestration infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Linux Distro Build Requirements</h4>
<p>Linux distros generally have stricter rules and less flexibility when building software that will go into their package feeds. The build is usually completed offline (disconnected from the internet). It may only use as inputs artifacts that have been previously created in that build system. Checked-in binaries are not allowed (though they can be eliminated at build time). Any source in the repository must meet strict licensing requirements. <em>See <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/license-information.md">license information</a> for information on .NET licensing and <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/legal/license-approval/#Good_Licenses">Fedora licensing approval</a> for sample distro requirements.</em> At a conceptual level, a Linux distro partner wants to be able to trace every artifact they ship to a set of sources and processes that they can reasonably edit. All future software should be built from previously Source Build produced artifacts. <em>Note: There is a <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/blob/main/Documentation/bootstrapping-guidelines.md">bootstrap process</a>, as you might imagine might be required.</em>.</p>
<h4>Single Build – A repo and orchestration framework to stitch the stack together</h4>
<p>As you’ve learned earlier, the .NET build, like many products, is actually comprised of the Azure DevOps builds of various components, stitched together with dependency updates. This means that the information and mechanics required to construct the product is distributed between the repositories (build logic within the build system and associated scripting, as well as YAML files processed by Azure DevOps) and the dependency flow information held by our ‘Maestro’ system (producer-consumer information). This isn’t usable for our Linux distro partners. They need to be able to build the product without access to these Microsoft resources. And they need to be able to do so in a way that is practical for their environments. Manually stitching together a product from a build graph isn’t reasonable. We need an orchestrator that encapsulates that information.</p>
<h5>The Source Build layout and orchestrator</h5>
<p>The orchestrator replaces the tasks that Azure DevOps and Maestro perform for .NET’s distributed build with ones that can be run from a single source layout, disconnected from the internet. You can see the modern, updated layout and orchestrator over at <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet">dotnet/dotnet</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Single source layout</strong> – A <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/tree/main/src">single source layout</a> with a copy of all components required to build the product. Submodules are flattened, if they exist (typically for external OSS components). The contents of the source layout are determined by identifying <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/7efd8a45363467689d38fcf05f0c5f720244d0c4/eng/Version.Details.xml#L16">an annotated dependency</a> for each component within the product graph, rooted at <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/sdk">dotnet/sdk</a>. The sha for that annotated dependency determines what content will populate the layout. <em>Note: dependencies like compilers and OS libs are provided by the build environment.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Information on how each component should be built, and its dependencies</strong> – For each of the components within the single source layout, a <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/tree/main/repo-projects">basic project</a> is provided which identifies how the component is built. In addition, the component level dependencies are also identified. i.e. the .NET Runtime needs to be built before ASP.NET Core can start.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
&lt;RepositoryReference Include="arcade" /&gt;
&lt;RepositoryReference Include="runtime" /&gt;
&lt;RepositoryReference Include="xdt" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build orchestrator logic</strong> – The <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/main/repo-projects/Directory.Build.targets">build orchestrator logic</a> is responsible for launching each build in the graph when it is ready (any dependencies have been successfully built), as well as inputs and outputs of each component. After a component build has been completed, the orchestrator is responsible for identifying the outputs and preparing inputs for downstream component builds. Think of this as a local Dependabot, computing the intersection of the declared input repositories against the package level dependency info (see <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/main/src/aspnetcore/eng/Version.Details.xml">aspnetcore’s</a>) for an example. More information on how dependency tracking works in .NET builds can be found in my <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/#tracking-our-dependencies">previous blog post</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compliance verification</strong> – The comparatively stricter environments that our Linux distro partners build in mean that it’s necessary that we build some automation to identify potential problems. The orchestrator can identify pre-built binary inputs, ‘poison’ leaks (previously source-built assets appearing in the current build outputs), and other hazards that might block our partners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Smoke testing</strong> – Most of our test logic remains in the individual repositories (more on that later), but the layout also includes <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/tree/main/test">smoke tests</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Single Implementation – Pre-built squeaky clean</h4>
<p>There are some obvious and non-obvious reasons why these requirements would be hard to meet using the ‘stock’ Microsoft build of .NET, and why Source Build required so much work. An offline build with pre-staged, identified inputs that are <strong>buildable from source</strong> is a major undertaking. When the Source Build team began to investigate what this meant, it was quickly obvious that a LOT of interesting behavior was hiding in the .NET product build. Sure, binary inputs like optimization data were obviously disallowed, but some other foundational assets like .NET Framework and NETStandard targeting packs were also not buildable from source. Either they weren’t open source in the first place, or they hadn’t been built in years. More concerning, the graph-like nature of .NET means that incoherency is very common. Some of this incoherency is undesirable (the kind we attempt to eliminate during our product construction process). Some of it is expected and even desired.</p>
<h5>Example: Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</h5>
<p>As an example, let’s take a look at the C# compiler analyzers, which are built in the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn">dotnet/roslyn</a> repository. The analyzers will reference various versions of the <code>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</code> package depending on the required surface area to ensure that a shipped analyzer runs all of the versions of Visual Studio and the .NET SDK that it is required to support. They reference a minimum possible version. This ensures that analyzers can be serviced in a sustainable fashion, rather than shipping a different version of an analyzer for every possible VS or SDK configuration.</p>
<p>Because multiple versions of the surface area are referenced, multiple versions of <code>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</code> are restored during the build. That would mean, for the purposes of Source Build, we need to build each and every one of those versions of <code>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</code> at some point. We have two ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-version source layout</strong> – Place multiple copies of dotnet/roslyn into the shared source layout, one for each referenced <code>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</code> version based on when it was originally produced. This is not only expensive in build time, but it tends to be somewhat viral. If you have 3 versions of dotnet/roslyn you need to build, you need to ensure that the transitive dependencies of those 3 versions are also present in the shared layout. The maintenance complexity of this setup goes up very quickly. These are previously shipped versions of the dotnet/roslyn source base. It will be necessary to maintain security and compliance of those codebases over time. Upgrading build-time dependencies. Removing EOL infrastructure, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Require previously source-built versions to be available</strong> – This is really just a flavor of the multi-version source layout with an element of “caching”. If a distro maintainer needs to rebuild the product from scratch, or if a new Linux distribution is being bootstrapped, they might need to reconstruct decent portion of .NET’s past releases just to get the latest one to build in a compliant fashion. And if those old versions require changes to build in a compliant fashion, you’re again in a maintenance headache.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Source Build Reference Packages</h4>
<p>There are numerous other examples like Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp. Any time a project targets a down-level target framework (e.g. net9 in the net10 build), the down-level reference pack is restored. SDK tooling (compilers, MSBuild) targets versions of common .NET packages that match the version shipped with Visual Studio. So how do we deal with this? We cannot simply unify on a single version of every component referenced within the product without fundamentally changing the product.</p>
<p>The Source Build team realized that a lot of this usage fit neatly into a class of “reference-only” packages.</p>
<ul>
<li>The targeting packs restored by the SDK when a project builds against a TFM that does not match the SDK’s major version (e.g. targeting net9 with a net10 SDK) do not contain implementation.</li>
<li>The reference to older versions of <code>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</code> are <em>surface area</em> only. No assets are <em>redistributed</em> from these packages. If the implementation is not needed, a reference-only package can be substituted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/source-build-reference-packages">dotnet/source-build-reference-packages</a>. A reference-only package is significantly simpler to create and build, and it meets the needs of the consumers in the build. We can generate reference package sources for packages where we do not need the implementation, then create an infrastructure to store, build and make them available during the Source Build process. Providing multiple versions is relatively trivial. The dotnet/source-build-reference-packages repository is built during the .NET build, and then consuming components restore and compile against provided reference surface area.</p>
<h4>What about all those non-reference cases?</h4>
<p>With a solution to reference packages, we can turn our attention to other inputs that are not Source Build compliant and do not fall into the ‘reference’ category. There are three major sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Closed source or inputs that cannot be built from source – Optimization data, Visual Studio integration packages, internal infrastructure dependencies, etc.</li>
<li>Legacy – Open source dependencies on implementation built in older versions of .NET.</li>
<li>Joins – Open source dependencies on implementation built on other platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at how we deal with these cases.</p>
<h5>Closed Source/Non-Source Buildable Inputs</h5>
<p>Closed source or any inputs that cannot be built from source aren’t allowable in the Linux distro maintainer builds, full stop. To resolve these cases, we analyze each usage to determine what to do. Remember that our goal is to provide a compliant build implementation for use by our distro partners, which is functionally as close to what Microsoft ships as is possible. i.e. we don’t want Microsoft’s Linux x64 SDK to <em>behave</em> in substantially different ways from RedHat’s Linux x64 SDK. This means that the runtime and sdk layouts for Linux x64 need to be as close as possible. The good news is that quite a lot of the closed source usage isn’t required to produce functionally equivalent assets. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>We might restore a package that enables signing, something not required in a distro partner build</li>
<li>The dotnet/roslyn repository builds components that power Visual Studio. These components have dependencies on Visual Studio packages that define the IDE integration surface area. However, this IDE integration doesn’t ship in the .NET SDK. This functionality could be “trimmed away” in Source Build by tweaking the build. This is reasonably common.</li>
</ul>
<p>If dependencies couldn’t be trimmed away without altering product functionality, we have a few additional options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open source the dependency</strong> – Often times, a closed source component, or at least a key portion of a closed source component required to satisfy a scenario, can be open sourced.</li>
<li><strong>Alter product behavior</strong> – Sometimes, the team can work to remove the product differences with intentional design changes. Remember that the important part is that everything that ships on distro partner package feeds needs to be built from source. This allows for some assets to be brought in dynamically. Think of this like the NPM package ecosystem vs. the NPM package manager. A distro might build the NPM package manager from source. This leaves users to dynamically restore NPM packages at build time.</li>
<li><strong>Live with slightly different behavior</strong> – These cases are few and far between. Prior to .NET 10, the WinForms and WPF project templates and WindowsDesktop were not included in the source-built Linux SDK, despite being available in Microsoft’s Linux distribution. This was due to the difficulty in building the required portions of those repositories on non-Windows platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Legacy Dependencies</h5>
<p>We’ve discussed what we can do with closed source and non-reproducible dependencies. What about legacy dependencies? First, what do we mean by ‘legacy’ dependency? As detailed in earlier discussion, there is quite a lot of ‘incoherency’ in the product. A project might build for multiple target frameworks, redistributing assets from older versions of .NET. This is all to support valuable customer scenarios. But building all the versions of these components isn’t feasible. This is where our <strong>single implementation</strong> rule comes into play. We choose a single version of each component to build and ship with the product. We do allow for <em>reference</em> to old versions, via dotnet/source-build-reference-packages, but relying on older implementations are off limits.</p>
<p>First, we look for a way to avoid the dependency. Is it needed for the Linux SDK we’re trying to produce? If not, we can eliminate that code path from the build. If so, is there an opportunity to unify on the single implementation? In a lot of cases, incoherency is just a result of the product components moving their dependencies forward at different rates. If all else fails, we could explore compromises that involve behavioral differences, but we want to avoid this as much as possible.</p>
<h5>Joins and Verticality</h5>
<p>Joins are the last major category of pre-builts to remove. They occur because we end up with intra-product dependencies that are built in another environment. For example, I might be running a build on Windows that creates a NuGet package for a global tool, but to build that NuGet package I need the native shim executables Mac and Linux and Windows. Those shims can only (reasonably) be built in the Mac and Linux host environments. These types of dependencies are indicative of a product build that is more ‘woven’ than ‘vertical’ and tend to naturally emerge over time in a multi-repo product construction graph. Each edge in that graph represents a sequence point where all the outputs of earlier nodes are available, regardless of where they were built. If a dependency can be taken, it will be taken.</p>
<p>However, the distro partner builds need to be single platform <em>and</em> single invocation to fit into distro partner requirements. Bootstrapping notwithstanding, they want to pull in the dependencies, disconnect the machine from the network, and hit build. At the end, out pops a bright new .NET SDK. Cross-platform dependencies preclude any such behavior. They block “build verticality”. Remember joins. We’ll need to come back to them later when we start implementing Unified Build for Microsoft based on the Source Build model.</p>
<p>For Source Build, we again deal with joins a bit like legacy dependencies. The key aspect to remember is that Source Build is narrowly focused on producing a .NET SDK and associated runtimes in the Linux distro partner build environments. So, we eliminate dependencies where possible (e.g. we don’t need to package Windows global tool executable stubs when running the SDK on Linux) and redesign the product or product construction process as necessary to meet requirements (e.g. .NET Workload manifests).</p>
<h2>The Vision – Dreaming up Unified Build</h2>
<p>Unified Build seeks to apply the general principles of our Linux distro partner Source Build to the product that Microsoft ships. Achieving this would result in big wins for Linux distro partners, upstream contributors and Microsoft, reducing maintenance costs and improving the ability to build and ship quickly. Although we knew from the outset that we likely can’t exactly match the exact Linux distro build approach without major changes in the product, we thought we could get close. .NET came up with the following high-level goals (<em>Note, “.NET distro maintainers” refers to anyone building .NET, including Microsoft</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>A single git commit denotes all product source for a particular .NET build. All commits are coherent</li>
<li>A single repo commit can produce a shippable build</li>
<li>.NET’s build shall be able to create a specific platform’s distribution in a single build environment.</li>
<li>.NET distro maintainers shall be able to efficiently update and build .NET (both collaboratively and separately) through the entire lifecycle of a .NET version (first to last commit).</li>
<li>.NET distro maintainers can produce downstream distributions without use of Microsoft provided services.</li>
<li>.NET distro maintainers shall be able to meet provenance and build environment requirements for their distributions.</li>
<li>.NET distro maintainers shall be able to coordinate patching of downstream distributions.</li>
<li>.NET distro maintainers can run verification tests against the built product.</li>
<li>.NET contributors shall be able to easily produce full product builds for testing, experimentation, etc.</li>
<li>.NET contributors shall be able to work efficiently on the section of the product for which they are concerned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, getting there would require solving a mountain of new problems. Let’s take a look at some of the problems we need to solve before we can use Source Build as Microsoft’s .NET build.</p>
<h3>Provide a way to determine what makes it into the product</h3>
<p>When you construct a product using the distributed model, the <em>build</em> of the product, the <em>validation</em> of the product and the determination of what actually <em>constitutes</em> the product are all tied together. Source Build operates on a flattened source layout based on a final coherent graph. However, it relies on the traditional .NET product construction process in order to determine what versions of each component show up in the layout. To get the full benefit we need a way to directly update components within the shared source base without complex dependency flow. Otherwise, if a developer wants to make a change in runtime, they will end up building the product twice. Once to flow the runtime build with their change through all paths that runtime reaches, then once again to build the product using that new runtime.</p>
<h4>What we have</h4>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/pre-ub-runtime-propagation-scaled.webp" alt="Pre-unified-build runtime change propagation">
<em>Highlighted paths show how a runtime change cascades through multiple repositories in the distributed build model, requiring sequential builds and dependency flow updates.</em></p>
<h4>What we need</h4>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/post-ub-runtime-propagation-scaled.webp" alt="Unified-build runtime change propagation">
<em>Highlighted path shows how a runtime change immediately flows into the source layout. We call this a ‘flat flow’</em></p>
<h3>Provide a way to react to breaking changes</h3>
<p>The flat flow significantly reduces the number of hops, and therefore the complexity and overhead in the process of a change making its way into the shared source layout. And we can see that before a change makes it into the product; it will still get PR validation and possibly some more in-depth rolling CI validation. However, let’s say that this change requires reaction in consuming components. Despite the change in dependency flow to a flat flow, ASP.NET Core still depends on .NET Runtime. And ASP.NET Core’s code in the layout doesn’t know about the new runtime change. Whatever PR validation we have before a change is allowed in the shared source layout is sure to fail.</p>
<p>In a traditional dependency flow system, we handle this by making changes in the dependency update PR. If an API is changed, the build breaks. A dev makes a change in the PR (ideally), validation is green, and the PR is merged. For the single-source methodology to work for .NET, we’ll need to be able to make changes to the source of <em>other</em> components in the dotnet/runtime update PR.</p>
<h3>Provide a way to validate against repository infrastructure</h3>
<p>As we discussed earlier, a large quantity of critical validation lives at the component repository level. That’s where the developers spend their time. Moving or copying all of this is probably wasteful, definitely expensive, and likely hard to maintain. If we can’t rely on the dependency flow to do the validation before components flow into the shared source layout, we’ll need a way to do so after.</p>
<p>To solve our problem, we could have all the outputs of a new product builds flow <strong>back</strong> into the individual repositories, matching with the dependencies in their <code>Version.Details.xml</code> files. That means dotnet/aspnetcore will get a bunch of new .NET Runtime packages, dotnet/sdk will get a bunch of newly built ASP.NET Core, .NET Runtime and Roslyn compiler packages, etc. They will be validating the ‘last built’ versions of their input dependencies against repository infrastructure.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/unified-build-backflow-validation-scaled.webp" alt="Unified Build validation on backflow">
<em>Backflow provides a way to validate the recently built .NET output against repository infrastructure</em></p>
<h3>Provide two-way code flow</h3>
<p>Let’s say a runtime insertion PR changed the signature of an API in <code>System.Text.Json</code>. When that forward flows, the responsible dev updates the signatures in all downstream users. Let’s say that’s code in <code>src/aspnetcore/*</code> and <code>src/windowsdesktop/*</code>. The new product is built, and the updated System.Text.Json package with the new API signature makes its way back to <code>dotnet/aspnetcore</code> and <code>dotnet/windowsdesktop</code>. The HEAD of <code>main</code> doesn’t have the source changes made directly in the shared layout forward flow PR. The dev would need to port those changes over, making changes in the backflow PR. This is tedious and error prone. Our new system will need to provide a way to automatically flow changes made in the shared layout back in the source repository.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/unified-build-full-flow-scaled.webp" alt="Unified Build two-way code flow">
<em>Component changes flow to our shared source layout, additional changes made only in the shared source layout flow back into the component repositories with supporting packages. Note that this is a general capability to backflow shared source changes, not just changes made in forward flow PRs.</em></p>
<h3>Provide better insertion time validation</h3>
<p>Validation on backflow isn’t perfect. It doesn’t provide an easy <em>pre-merge</em> gate for bad changes in dependent components. We can mitigate this by identifying and closing gaps in repo testing that allowed bad changes to be merged in the originating repo. We can also accept that some things will always slip through and that the process of creating a high-quality product isn’t just a green PR. Many repositories do not and cannot run their full testing suites prior to merging. However, we can <em>also</em> invest scenario testing run against the just-built product. This is something that our traditional dependency flow system is not good at.</p>
<p>Any whole product scenario testing relies on dependency updates for components reaching the dotnet/sdk repository. Up to that point, we don’t have a complete .NET product that we can test. Any attempt is just some kind of “Frankenbuild”. <em>Note: A lot of this end-to-end testing just comes in the form of dotnet/sdk’s repository-level PR/CI testing.</em>. However, changes can take a while to move through the graph to the point there they take effect in a way that would be visible in testing.</p>
<p>The Source Build methodology provides a full product build on each and every component change, regardless of where that component lives in the product construction graph. This means that we have the opportunity to create and run a comprehensive suite of testing on each of those insertions. That testing should be focused on covering wide swaths of product functionality. If this testing passes, there is a reasonable expectation that .NET is functioning in a way that makes it possible for development to make forward progress.</p>
<h3>Provide a way to build all of what .NET ships</h3>
<p>The Linux distro Source Build offering focuses narrowly on the assets in-box in the 1xx band SDK, ASP.NET Core, Runtime. It builds packages that support the creation of these layouts. As we saw earlier with prebuilt elimination, this narrow focus is necessary to be able to meet distro partner build requirements. If we want to build what Microsoft ships, we can’t have that narrow focus.</p>
<p>Expanding our focus is straightforward in some areas and difficult in others. In some ways, we’re just relaxing restrictions and bringing more functionality back into the build. We need to allow for pre-built binaries (e.g. signing functionality) to be restored from feeds. We need to build all TFMs instead of trimming away .NET Framework targets. We’ll need to build components originally excluded from the souce build focused shared source layout, like Windows Desktop, Winforms, WPF, EMSDK, etc. What’s more difficult are joins. Recall that Linux distro Source Build is single layout, single machine, single invocation.  This suffices for producing the layout, but there are a good handful of other artifacts in .NET that require builds on multiple machines. Artifacts that break the single machine verticality concept.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, we’d re-architect the product to avoid these joins. But it’s often hard to do so without customer compromise or driving complexity into the product itself. We can’t simplify the SDK without breaking customers, and this is hard to do, even across major versions, in an enterprise-grade product. Past decisions heavily influence future available choices. In the end, we’ll have to eliminate joins where we can via product construction practices. Any remaining joins will be something we have to live with. The build will have to be architected to run across multiple machines, via a series of build passes.</p>
<h2>Executing on the Vision – Shipping Unified Build</h2>
<p>The Unified Build project can roughly be divided into 4 phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial brainstorming and design (.NET 7)</strong> – The initial design work on the Unified Build project began in early 2022 during the development of .NET 7 and took ~4 months to complete. The project got full approval to start later in 2022 with the intention of completion by .NET 9 RTM, with some key go/no-go points where we could bail and still have a net win on infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Foundational work (.NET 8)</strong> – The Unified Build project during .NET 8 was focused on foundational work to improve the sustainability of the Source Build infrastructure and building features that were required to support the weight of the full build. The investments were designed to be a net positive for .NET overall, even if it turned out that our proof-of-concept stage discovered some major unknown problem and we had to change direction.</li>
<li><strong>Vertical Build/Code Flow Exploration (Early .NET 9)</strong> – After the foundational work completed, we moved to implement a vertical build for each of the 3 major OS families: Mac, Windows, and Linux. The intention was to identify as many of the problems we would need to solve during our productization phase as possible. We were especially interested in finding any previously unknown product construction join points. At the same time, we did a much deeper investigation into the options for code flow and code management, eventually proving out and settling on the implementation listed below.</li>
<li><strong>Productization (Late .NET 9-.NET 10)</strong> – Final implementation started in earnest towards the end of .NET 9 after a spring+summer delay. As a result of the delay, the ship date was pushed back to .NET 10. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise. This bought us about 6 extra months of bake time and allowed us to use the Unified Build product construction process starting midway through the .NET 10 Preview/RC cycle (Preview 4). .NET Preview 4 shipped with the new build process, but on the old code flow. Preview 5 added the new code flow, and we never looked back. Further refinement in developer workflow, more bake time for the build and code flow process happened over subsequent months.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, after almost 4 years of dreaming and work, Unified Build shipped with .NET 10 RTM!</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the key components of the project.</p>
<h3>VMR – The Virtual Monolithic Repository</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet">dotnet/dotnet VMR</a>, or “Virtual Monolithic Repository” forms the cornerstone of the Unified Build project. It is the source layout from which all of .NET is built, including by our Linux distro partners. It is the orchestrator. Functionally, it’s not much different from the source layout used prior to .NET 8.0. That layout has just been formalized into a git repository (vs. a source tarball). This is key, as it allows developers to work both in their individual component repository, where dev workflows might be very refined, as well as in the VMR when cross-cutting changes are necessary. .NET gets most of the benefits of the distributed repo world, without coherency problems.</p>
<h3>Vertical Build</h3>
<p>Vertical Build is .NET’s pivot to producing assets in a series of verticals. A vertical is defined as a single build command on a single machine that builds part of the .NET product without input from other verticals. Typically, we divide verticals up by the runtime that we’re trying to produce. For example, Windows x64 vs. MonoAOT vs. Linux arm64 vs. PGO profile Windows x86. Altogether there are 35-40 different verticals. We divide these into what we call “short stacks” and “tall stacks”. A short stack just builds the runtime. A tall stack builds all the way up through the SDK.</p>
<p>The original vision was that if we joined together all the outputs from parallel verticals, we’d have everything .NET needed to ship. Such a setup would be highly efficient and friendly to any upstream partners. Unfortunately, the design of the .NET product has baked in a few required joins over the years. For example, .NET workload packages can’t be built without access to numerous packages built across many operating systems. To resolve this, we ended up with two additional build passes. The good news is that those additional passes are on a reduced set of verticals and a reduced set of components within those verticals. Not perfect, but manageable.</p>
<h3>Code flow</h3>
<p>Probably the most interesting aspect of the Unified Build project is how code flow is managed. This is where .NET turns standard development patterns on their head a little bit. As detailed earlier, maintaining the product as a graph of interdependent components while flattening code flow into a shared coherent layout requires “two-way” code flow. Changes need to flow from components into the shared layout, and changes in the shared layout need to be able to flow back to the component repositories. Conceptually the code flow algorithm is no more complicated than anything you can model within a single git repository for a given project. The trick is to do this with repositories with no related git history.</p>
<p><strong>Note: The nitty gritty details of this algorithm will be covered in a future post by another team member. I’ll update this post to link to it when it’s available.</strong></p>
<p>For now, let’s take a look at the basics:</p>
<p>Both the VMR and the component repository keep track of the last code flow from their partner. This is tracked alongside standard dependency information in <code>eng/Version.Details.xml</code>, though one could imagine it could be kept elsewhere.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/5bceb8184fcde55143d2102a65c72bd6233e950b/eng/Version.Details.xml#L2">dotnet/runtime knows the VMR SHA of the last “<strong>backflow</strong>“</a>, which is the flow from the VMR to dotnet/runtime</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/fe21998bab3322ebf00893198bbb3cedf63b493a/src/source-manifest.json#L81-L86">The VMR knows the dotnet/runtime SHA of the last “<strong>forward flow</strong>“</a>, which is the flow from dotnet/runtime to the VMR.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is to determine the diff between the “last flow” and whatever is flowing in now. For example, in a very simple case, when a new commit is made to dotnet/runtime and no changes have been made to <code>src/dotnet/runtime</code> in the VMR, the dependency flow system will take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine two points, A and B, for which to compute a diff. For this case, point A is the last flow of dotnet/runtime that was checked in to the VMR (or is currently in PR). Point B is the new commit to dotnet/runtime.</li>
<li>Construct a patch file, remapping the files src/runtime files onto the directory structure of the VMR.</li>
<li>Open a PR with the diffs. See an <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/pull/3151">example forward flow</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/121366">example back flow</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>.NET 8 and .NET 9 use VMRs with only one-way code flow. These cases with no changes on the other side are trivial and robust. Things get spicier when developers start making changes on both sides, and when dependency flow starts shifting around over time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Computing the diff points gets more interesting and involves knowing which way that “last flow” was.</li>
<li>Merge conflicts arise and need to be dealt with in a way the developer can understand.</li>
<li>Changes in the source and target of code flow can cause havoc and need robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll leave code flow there for now. Stay tuned for more.</p>
<h3>Scenario Test Validation</h3>
<p>The last major pillar of Unified Build is additional scenario testing. To be clear, .NET does not lack testing. .NET Runtime could use month’s worth of machine time on every PR to validate its millions of tests if it were practical or pragmatic to do so. Our approval, build, validation and signoff procedures ensure high-quality shipping bits. Still, when making changes directly in the VMR, the flat flow introduces new <em>lag</em> between that making that change and in-depth validation of it against each of the VMR components. While we can’t run every last test on PR and CI, we did recognize that better automated <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/scenario-tests">scenario testing</a> could play a solid role in preventing regressions. The goal was to add tests that covered wide swaths of product functionality that were not directly tied to the build system or repository infrastructure. Instead, they executed against the final built product. If the scenario tests pass, then there is a good sense that the product is functional at a decent level and contributors won’t be blocked.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>So, what did .NET get for almost 4 years of dreaming, scheming, and hard work? That’s a lot of effort to put into one project. Did the outcome justify the investment? As it turns out, we got quite a lot.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the most visible outcomes and then take a peek under the covers.</p>
<h3>Flexibility, predictability and speed</h3>
<p>By far the biggest return we’ve seen on the investment is <strong>flexibility</strong>. Distributed product construction is slow. Producing coherent builds is slow. Checking in new fixes or content requires coordination to avoid “resetting the build”, because <strong>what</strong> you want to ship, and <strong>how</strong> you build it are tied together in a distributed, OSS-style ecosystem. Taking a new fix might mean you don’t have something ready to handoff for validation. Flat flow eliminates that coherency problem, separating the <strong>what</strong> and the <strong>how</strong>. This is incredibly valuable during the drive towards an RTM build or a servicing release. It means we can make fixes later in the release cycle, focusing much more on whether those fixes meet our servicing bar and much less on whether we can actually build and deliver the change. That flexibility is good for customers.</p>
<p>Some of that flexibility comes from the speed of the build. This may sound glacially slow (.NET is a big, complex product), but .NET set a goal of producing an unsigned build in less than 4 hours, signed in less than 7. That’s down from significantly longer times in .NET 8.0 and .NET 9.0. A build of 8.0 or 9.0 can easily run to 24 even if everything goes perfectly. A signed build in 7 hours means a rolling set of new .NET assets to validate ~3 times a day. Most of that build time improvement comes from simply removing <a href="#product-construction-overhead">overhead</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the flexibility also comes from predictability. Distributed product construction has more moving parts. It has more human touch points. More places for systems and processes to fail. This tends to make outcomes unpredictable. “<em>If I check in a fix to dotnet/runtime, when will I have a build ready?</em>” is a hard question to answer in a distributed system. I know how long dotnet/runtime’s build takes. But at what time will that change show up downstream via dependency flow? Will someone be around to review and approve it when it does? What’s the status of PR/CI validation downstream? Will a new important change be merged into dotnet/aspnetcore before we get a coherent build, setting us back on validation? This question is vastly easier to answer in .NET 10. The change flows into the VMR (or is made there directly) and will show up in the next build. The next build will take N hours.</p>
<h3>Infrastructural robustness and completeness</h3>
<p>Behind the flashier metrics, there are years of quality-of-life improvements to the infrastructure that pay major dividends day in and day out. Improvements to the Source Build infrastructure in .NET 8 reduced the cost of keeping Linux distro Source Build running. A lot of its cost was related to the delay between a change getting checked in and discovering whether it would break the build when it finally flowed through the graph and reached the shared source layout. It was not uncommon for the Source Build .NET SDK to not be “prebuilt-clean” or shippable by distro partners until the middle of the previews. The infrastructure improvements in .NET 8 made it much easier to identify new pre-built inputs at PR time when they are easier to diagnose and resolve, before they made their way in the source layout. We are now prebuilt clean 100% of the time. That then reduced the load on the Source Build team, which gave them bandwidth to work in other areas. They added build parallelism, more predictable dependency flow, better logging, removed unneccessary complexity…the list goes on and on. Investments that make a product successful.</p>
<p>Our signing tooling had to be overhauled to support signing on every platform for a wide variety of archive types. Without this work, we couldn’t have shipped Unified Build. But this expanded support benefits more than just the core .NET product. There are numerous ancillary repositories that were able to simplify their builds, avoiding shuttling bits from Mac/Linux to Windows machines where the signing tooling ran. Lower build overhead, faster and simpler builds.</p>
<h2>Future directions</h2>
<p>So where does the Unified Build project go next? While we won’t have the same level of investment in .NET 11, we’ll be making targeted improvements to the infrastructure to improve developer workflow and UX, mainly around code flow. One area I’m particularly excited about is AI agents that monitor code flow, connecting the dots between the various systems involved in creating the product and identifying issues. There are lots of systems and parties involved (Azure DevOps, GitHub, the code flow services and their configuration, code mirroring, developer approvals, machine allocation, etc.) in making a change go from PR to product. When it works, it works. When it doesn’t it’s often down to a human to track down exactly where the chain of events went wrong. It’s tedious and time consuming. We have tools, but it’s mainly about connecting lots of dots. We could write a rules engine for this, but my hunch is that it would be fragile and very complicated. Agents that can look at the system a little more fuzzily are ideally suited to this type of task. Less toil, a better .NET.</p>
<p>Lastly, beyond .NET 11, another push to get rid of join points might be on the horizon. The benefits are pretty clear: simpler, faster, and friendlier to contributors. We know now exactly how fast a build would be if you got rid of the remaining joins (less than 4 hours).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you made it this far, thanks! It’s good to provide some insight into how .NET build and ships. You’ve learned how distributed dependency flow product construction models aren’t always a great fit for shipping software predictably and reliably. These systems tend to have high complexity and overhead, which adds time. You’ve read about the roots of the .NET Unified Build project in .NET Linux distro Source Build, and what made it difficult to apply those concepts to .NET. Lastly, you learned how .NET applied those concepts and the drastic improvements we’ve seen in our day-to-day work.</p>
<p>The blog post detailing the flat code flow algorithms should be along shortly. Stay tuned!</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In my <a href="https://jayd.ml/2025/04/30/someone-at-youtube-needs-glasses.html">recent analysis of YouTube’s information density </a> I included the results from
an advanced statistical analysis on the number of videos present on the home
page, which projected that around May 2026 there would only be one lonely video 
on the home screen.</p>

<p><img alt="a comedic graph showing two points between 2017 and 2025 and a trend line showing that it will be 1 video in may and 0 in september" src="https://jayd.ml/assets/posts/2025-04-30-someone-at-youtube-needs-glasses/projection.png"></p>

<p>Amazingly, a disgruntled Googler <a href="https://youtu.be/_tZckjQylGU?t=25">leaked a recording of how YouTube’s PM 
org handled the criticism</a> as it sat at the
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43846487">top of Hacker News</a> for a whole 
day for some reason.</p>

<p>The net result is that after months of hard work by <del>Gemini</del> YouTube engineers, 
the other day I fired up YouTube on an Apple TV and was graced with this:</p>

<p><img alt="there is only one ad and one video visible" src="https://jayd.ml/assets/posts/2025-11-10-someone-at-youtube-needs-glasses-part-ii/prophecy.jpg"></p>

<p>Let’s analyze this picture and count the number of videos on the home screen:</p>

<p><img alt="same image as before but comedically labelled with a big red one" src="https://jayd.ml/assets/posts/2025-11-10-someone-at-youtube-needs-glasses-part-ii/annotated.jpg"></p>

<p>Unfortunately the YouTube PM org’s myopia is accelerating: with this data I now 
project that there will be zero videos on the homescreen around May of 2026 now, 
up from September.</p>

<p><img alt="new datapoint added and a new trendline" src="https://jayd.ml/assets/posts/2025-11-10-someone-at-youtube-needs-glasses-part-ii/updated.jpg"></p>

<p>Apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law">Poe’s Law</a> applies to 
Google PMs, satire is dead, and maybe our mandatory NeuraLinks are coming sooner 
than I thought.</p>

<p dir="auto">Every dollar spent on vendors with documented pre-consent tracking is a dollar potentially spent on future legal liability. When class actions emerge in this space, "we didn't know" often isn't accepted as a defense — it can be characterized as negligence.</p>

Contractors would confirm home and work addresses for people targeted for removal by—among other techniques—photographing residences, documenting comings and goings, and staking out workplaces and apartment complexes.</p><p>Those filings cast the initiative as a substantial but limited pilot program. Contractors were guaranteed as little as $250 and could earn no more than $90 million each, with the overall program capped at $180 million. That structure pointed to meaningful scale but still framed the effort as a controlled trial, not an integral component of ICE’s removal operations.</p><p>Newly released amendments dismantle that structure. ICE has removed the program’s spending cap and replaced it with dramatically higher per-vendor limits. Contractors may now earn up to $281.25 million individually and are guaranteed an initial task order worth at least $7.5 million. The shift signals to ICE’s contracting base that this is no longer an experiment, but an investment, and that the agency expects prime-tier contractors to stand up the staffing, technology, and field operations needed to function as a de facto arm of federal enforcement.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment.</p><p>The proposed scope was already large. It described contractors receiving monthly recurring batches of 50,000 cases drawn from a docket of 1.5 million people. Private investigators would confirm individuals’ locations not only through commercial data brokers and open-source research, but via in-person visits when required. The filings outline a performance-based structure with bounty-like incentives: Firms will be paid a fixed price per case, plus bonuses for speed and accuracy, with vendors expected to propose their own incentive rates.</p><p>The contract also authorizes the Department of Justice and other DHS components to issue their own orders under the program.</p><p>Previous filings hinted that private investigators might receive access to ICE’s internal case-management systems—databases that contain photos, biographical details, immigration histories, and other enforcement notes. The amended filings reverse that, stating that contractors will not be permitted inside agency systems under any circumstance. Instead, DHS will send contractors exported case packets containing a range of personal data on each target. This change limits direct exposure to federal systems, but still places large volumes of sensitive information in the hands of private surveillance firms operating outside public oversight.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The proposal is only the latest effort by the Trump administration to dramatically broaden the role of contractors inside ICE’s enforcement operations. WIRED first reported plans last month to install a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-is-building-a-24-7-shadow-transportation-network-across-texas/">contractor-run transportation network</a> across the state of Texas, staffed by armed teams moving detainees around the clock. Earlier this fall, the agency sought a private vendor to staff <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-social-media-surveillance-24-7-contract/">two 24/7 social media “targeting centers,”</a> where contract analysts would scan platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and X for leads to feed directly into detention operations. And a separate proposal this month called for a <a data-offer-url="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-call-center-unaccompanied-minors-trump-rcna242313" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-call-center-unaccompanied-minors-trump-rcna242313&quot;}" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-call-center-unaccompanied-minors-trump-rcna242313" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">privately run national call center</a>, operated almost entirely by an industry partner, to field up to 7,000 enforcement calls per day with only minimal federal staff on site.</p><p>Ultimately, the escalation in ICE’s private surveillance commitments reflects a basic reality—that few contractors will marshal the workforce, logistics, and infrastructure the agency demands without substantial assurances. By boosting guarantees and eliminating the cap, ICE can now fast-track an effort to place contract surveillance agents throughout its enforcement pipeline.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>All of modern mathematics is built on the foundation of set theory, the study of how to organize abstract collections of objects. But in general, research mathematicians don’t need to think about it when they’re solving their problems. They can take it for granted that sets behave the way they’d expect, and carry on with their work.</p>
<p>Descriptive set theorists are an exception. This small community of mathematicians never stopped studying the fundamental nature of sets — particularly the strange infinite ones that other mathematicians ignore.</p>
<p>Their field just got a lot less lonely. In 2023, a mathematician named <a href="https://bahtoh-math.github.io/">Anton Bernshteyn</a> published a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-023-01188-3">deep and surprising connection</a> between the remote mathematical frontier of descriptive set theory and modern computer science.</p>
<p>He showed that all problems about certain kinds of infinite sets can be rewritten as problems about how networks of computers communicate. The bridge connecting the disciplines surprised researchers on both sides. Set theorists use the language of logic, computer scientists the language of algorithms. Set theory deals with the infinite, computer science with the finite. There’s no reason why their problems should be related, much less equivalent.</p>
<p>“This is something really weird,” said <a href="https://vaclavrozhon.github.io/">Václav Rozhoň</a>, a computer scientist at Charles University in Prague. “Like, you are not supposed to have this.”</p>
<p>Since Bernshteyn’s result, his peers have been exploring how to move back and forth across the bridge to prove new theorems on either side, and how to extend that bridge to new classes of problems. Some descriptive set theorists are even starting to apply insights from the computer science side to reorganize the landscape of their entire field, and to rethink the way they understand infinity.</p>

    <p>“This whole time we’ve been working on very similar problems without directly talking to each other,” said <a href="https://www.math.cmu.edu/~clintonc/">Clinton Conley</a>, a descriptive set theorist at Carnegie Mellon University. “It just opens the doors to all these new collaborations.”</p>
<h2><strong>Broken Sets</strong></h2>
<p>Bernshteyn was an undergraduate when he first heard of descriptive set theory — as an example of a field that had once mattered, then decayed to nothing. More than a year would pass before he found out the professor had been wrong.</p>
<p>In 2014, as a first-year graduate student at the University of Illinois, Bernshteyn took a logic course with <a href="https://www.math.mcgill.ca/atserunyan/">Anush Tserunyan</a>, who would later become one of his advisers. She corrected the misconception. “She should take all the credit for me being in this field,” he said. “She really made it seem that logic and set theory is this glue that connects all different parts of math.”</p>
<p>Descriptive set theory dates back to Georg Cantor, who proved in 1874 that there are <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-can-some-infinities-be-bigger-than-others-20230419/">different sizes of infinity</a>. The set of whole numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, …), for instance, is the same size as the set of all fractions, but smaller than the set of all real numbers.</p>

    <p>At the time, mathematicians were deeply uncomfortable with this menagerie of different infinities. “It’s hard to wrap your head around,” said Bernshteyn, who is now at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Partly in response to that discomfort, mathematicians developed a different notion of size — one that described, say, how much length or area or volume a set might occupy, rather than the number of elements it contained. This notion of size is known as a set’s “measure” (in contrast to Cantor’s notion of size, which is a set’s “cardinality”). One of the simplest types of measure — the Lebesgue measure — quantifies a set’s length. While the set of real numbers between zero and 1 and the set of real numbers between zero and 10 are both infinite and have the same cardinality, the first has a Lebesgue measure of 1 and the second a Lebesgue measure of 10.</p>

<p>To study more complicated sets, mathematicians use other types of measures. The uglier a set is, the fewer ways there are to measure it. Descriptive set theorists ask questions about which sets can be measured according to different definitions of “measure.” They then arrange them in a hierarchy based on the answers to those questions. At the top are sets that can be constructed easily and studied using any notion of measure you want. At the bottom are “unmeasurable” sets, which are so complicated they can’t be measured at all. “The word people often use is ‘pathological,’” Bernshteyn said. “Nonmeasurable sets are really bad. They’re counterintuitive, and they don’t behave well.”</p>
<p>This hierarchy doesn’t just help set theorists map out the landscape of their field; it also gives them insights into what tools they can use to tackle more typical problems in other areas of math. Mathematicians in some fields, such as dynamical systems, group theory and probability theory, need information about the size of the sets they’re using. A set’s position in the hierarchy determines what tools they can use to solve their problem.</p>
<p>Descriptive set theorists are thus like librarians, tending to a massive bookshelf of different kinds of infinite sets (and the different ways of measuring them). Their job is to take a problem, determine how complicated a set its solution requires, and place it on the proper shelf, so that other mathematicians can take note.</p>
<h2><strong>Making a Choice</strong></h2>
<p>Bernshteyn belongs to a group of librarians who sort problems about infinite sets of nodes connected by edges, called graphs. In particular, he studies graphs that have infinitely many separate pieces, each containing infinitely many nodes. Most graph theorists don’t study these kinds of graphs; they focus on finite ones instead. But such infinite graphs can represent and provide information about dynamical systems and other important kinds of sets, making them a major area of interest for descriptive set theorists.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the kind of infinite graph that Bernshteyn and his colleagues might study. Start with a circle, which contains infinitely many points. Pick one point: This will be your first node. Then move a fixed distance around the circle’s circumference. This gives you a second node. For example, you might move one-fifth of the way around the circle. Connect the two nodes with an edge. Move the same distance to a third node, and connect it to the previous one. And so on.</p>
<p>If you move one-fifth of the way around the circle each time, it’ll take five steps to get back where you started. In general, if you move any distance that can be written as a fraction, the nodes will form a closed loop. But if the distance can’t be written as a fraction, the process will go on forever. You’ll get an infinite number of connected nodes.</p>

            <p>But that’s not all: This infinitely long sequence forms only the first piece of your graph. Even though it contains infinitely many nodes, it doesn’t contain all the points on the circle. To generate the other pieces of the graph, start at one of those other points. Now move the same distance at each step as you did in the first piece. You’ll end up building a second infinite sequence of connected nodes, totally disconnected from the first.</p>
        </div>
    <figure>
        <div>
                            <p><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SetTheory-Algorithms-Fig2-crMarkBelan-Mobilev1-1.svg" alt="" decoding="async"><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SetTheory-Algorithms-Fig2-crMarkBelan-Desktopv4.svg" alt="" decoding="async">                </p>

            </figure>
<div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Do this for every possible new starting point on the circle. You’ll get a graph consisting of infinitely many separate pieces, with each piece made of an infinite number of nodes.</p>
<p>Mathematicians can then ask whether it’s possible to color the nodes in this graph so that they obey certain rules. Using just two colors, for instance, can you color every node in the graph so that no two connected nodes are the same color? The solution might seem straightforward. Look at the first piece of your graph, pick a node, and color it blue. Then color the rest of the piece’s nodes in an alternating pattern: yellow, blue, yellow, blue. Do the same for every piece in your graph: Pick a node, color it blue, then alternate colors. Ultimately, you’ll use just two colors to achieve your task.</p>
</div>

                            <p><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SetTheory-Algorithms-Fig3-crMarkBelan-Mobilev1-1.svg" alt="" decoding="async"><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SetTheory-Algorithms-Fig3-crMarkBelan-Desktopv1.svg" alt="" decoding="async">                </p>
                        </div>
            </figure>
<div data-role="selectable">
    <p>But to accomplish this coloring, you had to rely on a hidden assumption that set theorists call the axiom of choice. It’s one of the nine fundamental building blocks from which all mathematical statements are constructed. According to this axiom, if you start with a bunch of sets, you can choose one item from each of those sets to create a new set — even if you have infinitely many sets to choose from. This axiom is useful, in that it allows mathematicians to prove all sorts of statements of interest. But it also leads to strange paradoxes. Descriptive set theorists avoid it.</p>
<p>Your graph had infinitely many pieces. This corresponds to having infinitely many sets. You chose one item from each set — the first point you decided to color blue in each of the pieces. All those blue points formed a new set. You used the axiom of choice.</p>
<p>Which leads to a problem when you color the rest of the nodes in alternating patterns of blue and yellow. You’ve colored each node (which has zero length) separately, without any understanding of how nodes relate to one another when they come from different pieces of the graph. This means that you can’t describe the set of all the graph’s blue nodes, or the set of all its yellow nodes, in terms of length either. In other words, these sets are unmeasurable. Mathematicians can’t say anything useful about them.</p>
<p>To descriptive set theorists, this is unsatisfying. And so they want to figure out a way to color the graph in a continuous way — a way that doesn’t use the axiom of choice, and that gives them measurable sets.</p>
<p>To do this, remember how you built the first piece of your graph: You picked a node on a circle and connected it to a second node some distance away. Now color the first node blue, the second yellow, and the entire arc between them blue. Similarly, color the arc between the second and third nodes yellow. Color the third arc blue. And so on.</p>
</div>
    <figure>
        <div>
                            <p><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SetTheory-Algorithms-Fig4-crMarkBelan-Mobilev1.svg" alt="" decoding="async"><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SetTheory-Algorithms-Fig4-crMarkBelan-Desktopv1.svg" alt="" decoding="async">                </p>
                        </div>
            </figure>
<div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Soon, you’ll have made it almost completely around the circle — meaning that you’ve assigned a color to all the nodes in your graph except for the ones that fall in a small, leftover segment. Say the last arc you colored was yellow. How do you color this final, smaller segment? You can’t use blue, because these nodes will connect to nodes in the original arc you colored blue. But you also can’t use yellow, because these nodes connect back to yellow ones from the previous arc.</p>
<p>You have to use a third color — say, green — to complete your coloring.</p>
<p>Still, the sets of blue, yellow and green nodes you end up with are all just pieces of the circle’s circumference, rather than the scatterings of points you ended up with when you used the axiom of choice. You can calculate the lengths of these sets. They’re measurable.</p>
<p>Descriptive set theorists therefore place the two-color version of the problem on the lowest shelf in their hierarchy (for unmeasurable sets), while the three-color problem goes on a much higher shelf of problems — ones where lots of notions of measure can be applied.</p>
<p>Bernshteyn spent his years in graduate school studying such coloring problems, shelving them one by one. Then, shortly after he finished his degree, he stumbled on a potential way to shelve them all at once — and to show that these problems have a much deeper and more mathematically relevant structure than anyone had realized.</p>
<h2><strong>Round by Round</strong></h2>
<p>From time to time, Bernshteyn enjoys going to computer science talks, where graphs are finite and represent networks of computers.</p>
<p>In 2019, one of those talks changed the course of his career. It was about “distributed algorithms” — sets of instructions that run simultaneously on multiple computers in a network to accomplish a task without a central coordinator.</p>
<p>Say you have a bunch of Wi-Fi routers in a building. Nearby routers can interfere with each other if they use the same communication frequency channel. So each router needs to choose a different channel from the ones used by its immediate neighbors.</p>
<p>Computer scientists can reframe this as a coloring problem on a graph: Represent each router as a node, and connect nearby ones with edges. Using just two colors (representing two different frequency channels), find a way to color each node so that no two connected nodes are the same color.</p>

<p>But there’s a catch: Nodes can only communicate with their immediate neighbors, using so-called local algorithms. First, each node runs the same algorithm and assigns itself a color. It then communicates with its neighbors to learn how other nodes are colored in a small region around it. Then it runs the algorithm again to decide whether to keep its color or switch it. It repeats this step until the whole network has a proper coloring.</p>
<p>Computer scientists want to know how many steps a given algorithm requires. For example, any local algorithm that can solve the router problem with only two colors must be incredibly inefficient, but it’s possible to find a very efficient local algorithm if you’re allowed to use three.</p>
<p>At the talk Bernshteyn was attending, the speaker discussed these thresholds for different kinds of problems. One of the thresholds, he realized, sounded a lot like a threshold that existed in the world of descriptive set theory — about the number of colors required to color certain infinite graphs in a measurable way.</p>
<p>To Bernshteyn, it felt like more than a coincidence. It wasn’t just that computer scientists are like librarians too, shelving problems based on how efficiently their algorithms work. It wasn’t just that these problems could also be written in terms of graphs and colorings.</p>
<p>Perhaps, he thought, the two bookshelves had more in common than that. Perhaps the connection between these two fields went much, much deeper.</p>
<p>Perhaps all the books, and their shelves, were identical, just written in different languages — and in need of a translator.</p>
<h2><strong>Opening the Door</strong></h2>
<p>Bernshteyn set out to make this connection explicit. He wanted to show that every efficient local algorithm can be turned into a Lebesgue-measurable way of coloring an infinite graph (that satisfies some additional important properties). That is, one of computer science’s most important shelves is equivalent to one of set theory’s most important shelves (high up in the hierarchy).</p>
<p>He began with the class of network problems from the computer science lecture, focusing on their overarching rule — that any given node’s algorithm uses information about just its local neighborhood, whether the graph has a thousand nodes or a billion.</p>
<p>To run properly, all the algorithm has to do is label each node in a given neighborhood with a unique number, so that it can log information about nearby nodes and give instructions about them. That’s easy enough to do in a finite graph: Just give every node in the graph a different number.</p>

    <p>If Bernshteyn could run the same algorithm on an infinite graph, it meant he could color the graph in a measurable way — solving a graph-coloring question on the set theory side. But there was a problem: These infinite graphs are “uncountably” infinite. There’s no way to uniquely label all their nodes.</p>
<p>Bernshteyn’s challenge was to find a cleverer way to label the graphs.</p>
<p>He knew that he’d have to reuse labels. But that was fine so long as nearby nodes were labeled differently. Was there a way to assign labels without accidentally reusing one in the same neighborhood?</p>
<p>Bernshteyn showed that there is always a way — no matter how many labels you decide to use, and no matter how many nodes your local neighborhood has. This means that you can always safely extend the algorithm from the computer science side to the set theory side. “Any algorithm in our setup corresponds to a way of measurably coloring any graph in the descriptive set theory setup,” Rozhoň said.</p>
<p>The proof came as a surprise to mathematicians. It demonstrated a deep link between computation and definability, and between algorithms and measurable sets. Mathematicians are now exploring how to take advantage of Bernshteyn’s discovery. In a paper published this year, for instance, Rozhoň and his colleagues figured out that it’s possible to <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITCS.2022.29">color special graphs called trees</a> by looking at the same problem in the computer science context. The result also illuminated which tools mathematicians might use to study the trees’ corresponding dynamical systems. “This is a very interesting experience, trying to prove results in a field where I don’t understand even the basic definitions,” Rozhoň said.</p>
        
        
<p>Mathematicians have also been working to translate problems in the other direction. In one case, they used set theory to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03683">prove a new estimate</a> of how hard a certain class of problems is to solve.</p>
<p>Bernshteyn’s bridge isn’t just about having a new tool kit for solving individual problems. It has also allowed set theorists to gain a clearer view of their field. There were lots of problems that they had no idea how to classify. In many cases, that’s now changed, because set theorists have computer scientists’ more organized bookshelves to guide them.</p>
<p>Bernshteyn hopes this growing area of research will change how the working mathematician views set theorists’ work — that they’ll no longer see it as remote and disconnected from the real mathematical world. “I’m trying to change this,” he said. “I want people to get used to thinking about infinity.”</p>

      <h2>What is Unison?</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Unison is a programming language built around <a href="https://www.unison-lang.org/docs/the-big-idea/">one big idea</a>: let's identify a definition by its actual contents, <strong>not</strong> just by the human-friendly name that also referred to older versions of the definition. Our ecosystem leverages this core idea from the ground up. Some benefits: we never compile the same code twice; many versioning conflicts simply <em>aren't</em>; and we're able to build sophisticated self-deploying distributed systems within a single strongly-typed program.</p>
      <p>Unison code lives in a database—your "codebase"—rather than in text files. The human-friendly names are in the codebase too, but they're materialized as text only when reading or editing your code.</p>

    <div>
    <faq-item><details>
  <summary>
    
    <span>Why make a whole new programming language? Couldn't you add Unison's features to another language?</span>
  </summary>
  <div>
      <p>
        Unison's hash-based, database-backed representation changes how code is identified, versioned, and shared. As a consequence, the workflow, toolchain, and deployment model are not add-ons; they emerge naturally from the language's design. In theory, you could try to retrofit these ideas onto another language, but doing so might be fragile, difficult to make reliable in production, and would likely require rewriting major parts of the existing tooling while restricting language features.

    <faq-item><details>
  <summary>
    
    <span>Is anyone using Unison in prod?</span>
  </summary>
  <p>Yes, <strong>we</strong> are! Our entire Cloud orchestration layer is written entirely in Unison, and it has powered Unison Cloud from day one.</p>

    <span>I'm concerned about vendor lock-in; do I have to use Unison Cloud to deploy my services?</span>

</faq-item>
    <faq-item><details>
  <summary>
    
    <span>What does collaborating look like in Unison?</span>
  </summary>
  <div>
      <p>Unison Share supports organizations, tickets, code contributions (pull requests), code review, and more.</p>
        <p>In many ways Unison's story for collaboration outstrips the status quo of developer tooling. e.g. merge conflicts only happen when two people actually modify the same definition; not because you moved some stuff around in your files.</p>
    </div>
</details>


</faq-item>
    <faq-item><details>
  <summary>
    
    <span>How does version control work in the absence of Git?</span>
  </summary>
  <p>Unison implements a native version control system: with projects, branches, clone, push, pull, merge, etc.</p>
</details>


</faq-item>
    <faq-item><details>
  <summary>
    
    <span>Do I have to use a specific IDE?</span>
  </summary>
  <p>No, you can pick any IDE that you're familiar with. Unison exposes an LSP server and many community members have contributed <a href="https://www.unison-lang.org/docs/usage-topics/editor-setup/">their own editor setups here</a>.</p>

    <span>What about interop with other languages?</span>

    <faq-item><details>
  <summary>
    
    <span>Without files, how do I see my codebase?</span>
  </summary>
  <p>Your codebase structure is viewable with the <a href="https://www.unison-lang.org/docs/tooling/ucm-desktop/">Unison Desktop app</a>. The UCM Desktop app also features click-through to definition tooling and rich rendering of docs.</p>

Nevertheless, as Google has indicated that they are already aware of data exfiltration risks exemplified by our research, we did not undertake responsible disclosure.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">First, set up a pricing model. You can do so in the <a href="https://app.flowglad.com/store/pricing-models" rel="nofollow">dashboard</a> in just a few clicks using a template, that you can then customize to suit your specific needs.</p>
<p dir="auto">We currently have templates for the following pricing models:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Usage-limit + Subscription Hybrid (like Cursor)</li>
<li>Unlimited Usage (like ChatGPT consumer)</li>
<li>Tiered Access and Usage Credits (like Midjourney)</li>
<li>Feature-Gated Subscription (like Linear)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">And more on the way. If you don't see a pricing model from our templates that suits you, you can always make one from scratch.</p>

<p dir="auto">In the last 15 years, the market has given developers more options than ever for every single part of their stack. But when it comes to payments, there have been virtually zero new entrants. The existing options are slim, and almost all of them require us to talk to sales to even set up an account. When it comes to <em>self-serve</em> payments, there are even fewer options.</p>
<p dir="auto">The result? The developer experience and cost of payments has barely improved in that time. Best in class DX in payments feels eerily suspended in 2015. Meanwhile, we've enjoyed constant improvements in auth, compute, hosting, and practically everything else.</p>
<p dir="auto">Flowglad wants to change that.</p>
<p dir="auto">We're building a payments layer that lets you:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Think about billing and payments as little as possible</li>
<li>Spend as little time on integration and maintenance as possible</li>
<li>Get as much out of your single integration as possible</li>
<li>Unlock more payment providers from a single integration</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Achieving this mission will take time. It will be hard. It might even make some people unhappy. But with AI bringing more and more developers on line and exploding the complexity of startup billing, the need is more urgent than ever.</p>

This is one of the very confusing things about the models right now. How to reconcile the fact that they are doing so well on </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2PiawPFJeyCQGcwXG/a-starter-guide-for-evals" rel="">evals</a><span>? You look at the evals and you go, “Those are pretty hard evals.” They are doing so well. But the economic impact seems to be dramatically behind. It’s very difficult to make sense of, how can the model, on the one hand, do these amazing things, and then on the other hand, repeat itself twice in some situation?</span></p><p>An example would be, let’s say you use vibe coding to do something. You go to some place and then you get a bug. Then you tell the model, “Can you please fix the bug?” And the model says, “Oh my God, you’re so right. I have a bug. Let me go fix that.” And it introduces a second bug. Then you tell it, “You have this new second bug,” and it tells you, “Oh my God, how could I have done it? You’re so right again,” and brings back the first bug, and you can alternate between those. How is that possible? I’m not sure, but it does suggest that something strange is going on.</p><p><span>I have two possible explanations. The more whimsical explanation is that maybe </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning" rel="">RL training</a><span> makes the models a little too single-minded and narrowly focused, a little bit too unaware, even though it also makes them aware in some other ways. Because of this, they can’t do basic things.</span></p><p><span>But there is another explanation. Back when people were doing </span><a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/pre_training" rel="">pre-training</a><span>, the question of what data to train on was answered, because that answer was everything. When you do pre-training, you need all the data. So you don’t have to think if it’s going to be this data or that data.</span></p><p>But when people do RL training, they do need to think. They say, “Okay, we want to have this kind of RL training for this thing and that kind of RL training for that thing.” From what I hear, all the companies have teams that just produce new RL environments and just add it to the training mix. The question is, well, what are those? There are so many degrees of freedom. There is such a huge variety of RL environments you could produce.</p><p>One thing you could do, and I think this is something that is done inadvertently, is that people take inspiration from the evals. You say, “Hey, I would love our model to do really well when we release it. I want the evals to look great. What would be RL training that could help on this task?” I think that is something that happens, and it could explain a lot of what’s going on.</p><p>If you combine this with generalization of the models actually being inadequate, that has the potential to explain a lot of what we are seeing, this disconnect between eval performance and actual real-world performance, which is something that we don’t today even understand, what we mean by that.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:05:00</em></p><p><span>I like this idea that the real </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_hacking" rel="">reward hacking</a><span> is the human researchers who are too focused on the evals.</span></p><p>I think there are two ways to understand, or to try to think about, what you have just pointed out. One is that if it’s the case that simply by becoming superhuman at a coding competition, a model will not automatically become more tasteful and exercise better judgment about how to improve your codebase, well then you should expand the suite of environments such that you’re not just testing it on having the best performance in coding competition. It should also be able to make the best kind of application for X thing or Y thing or Z thing.</p><p>Another, maybe this is what you’re hinting at, is to say, “Why should it be the case in the first place that becoming superhuman at coding competitions doesn’t make you a more tasteful programmer more generally?” Maybe the thing to do is not to keep stacking up the amount and diversity of environments, but to figure out an approach which lets you learn from one environment and improve your performance on something else.</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:06:08</em></p><p>I have a human analogy which might be helpful. Let’s take the case of competitive programming, since you mentioned that. Suppose you have two students. One of them decided they want to be the best competitive programmer, so they will practice 10,000 hours for that domain. They will solve all the problems, memorize all the proof techniques, and be very skilled at quickly and correctly implementing all the algorithms. By doing so, they became one of the best.</p><p>Student number two thought, “Oh, competitive programming is cool.” Maybe they practiced for 100 hours, much less, and they also did really well. Which one do you think is going to do better in their career later on?</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:06:56</em></p><p>The second.</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:06:57</em></p><p>Right. I think that’s basically what’s going on. The models are much more like the first student, but even more. Because then we say, the model should be good at competitive programming so let’s get every single competitive programming problem ever. And then let’s do some data augmentation so we have even more competitive programming problems, and we train on that. Now you’ve got this great competitive programmer.</p><p>With this analogy, I think it’s more intuitive. Yeah, okay, if it’s so well trained, all the different algorithms and all the different proof techniques are right at its fingertips. And it’s more intuitive that with this level of preparation, it would not necessarily generalize to other things.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:07:39</em></p><p><span>But then what is the analogy for what the second student is doing before they do the 100 hours of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning_(deep_learning)" rel="">fine-tuning</a><span>?</span></p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:07:48</em></p><p>I think they have “it.” The “it” factor. When I was an undergrad, I remember there was a student like this that studied with me, so I know it exists.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:08:01</em></p><p>I think it’s interesting to distinguish “it” from whatever pre-training does. One way to understand what you just said about not having to choose the data in pre-training is to say it’s actually not dissimilar to the 10,000 hours of practice. It’s just that you get that 10,000 hours of practice for free because it’s already somewhere in the pre-training distribution. But maybe you’re suggesting there’s actually not that much generalization from pre-training. There’s just so much data in pre-training, but it’s not necessarily generalizing better than RL.</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:08:31</em></p><p><span>The main strength of pre-training is that: A, there is so much of it, and B, you don’t have to think hard about what data to put into pre-training. It’s very natural data, and it does include in it a lot of what people do: people’s thoughts and a lot of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)" rel="">features</a><span>. It’s like the whole world as projected by people onto text, and pre-training tries to capture that using a huge amount of data.</span></p><p>Pre-training is very difficult to reason about because it’s so hard to understand the manner in which the model relies on pre-training data. Whenever the model makes a mistake, could it be because something by chance is not as supported by the pre-training data? “Support by pre-training” is maybe a loose term. I don’t know if I can add anything more useful on this. I don’t think there is a human analog to pre-training.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:09:39</em></p><p><span>Here are analogies that people have proposed for what the human analogy to pre-training is. I’m curious to get your thoughts on why they’re potentially wrong. One is to think about the first 18, or 15, or 13 years of a person’s life when they aren’t necessarily economically productive, but they are doing something that is making them understand the world better and so forth. The other is to think about </span><a href="https://gwern.net/backstop" rel="">evolution as doing some kind of search</a><span> for 3 billion years, which then results in a human lifetime instance.</span></p><p>I’m curious if you think either of these are analogous to pre-training. How would you think about what lifetime human learning is like, if not pre-training?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:10:22</em></p><p><span>I think there are some similarities between both of these and pre-training, and pre-training tries to play the role of both of these. But I think there are some big differences as well. The </span><a href="https://www.glennklockwood.com/garden/LLM-training-datasets" rel="">amount of pre-training data</a><span> is very, very staggering.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:10:39</em></p><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:10:40</em></p><p>Somehow a human being, after even 15 years with a tiny fraction of the pre-training data, they know much less. But whatever they do know, they know much more deeply somehow. Already at that age, you would not make mistakes that our AIs make.</p><p>There is another thing. You might say, could it be something like evolution? The answer is maybe. But in this case, I think evolution might actually have an edge. I remember reading about this case. One way in which neuroscientists can learn about the brain is by studying people with brain damage to different parts of the brain. Some people have the most strange symptoms you could imagine. It’s actually really, really interesting.</p><p><span>One case that comes to mind that’s relevant. I read about this person who had some kind of </span><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/06/how-only-using-logic-destroyed-a-man.html" rel="">brain damage, a stroke or an accident, that took out his emotional processing</a><span>. So he stopped feeling any emotion. He still remained very articulate and he could solve little puzzles, and on tests he seemed to be just fine. But he felt no emotion. He didn’t feel sad, he didn’t feel anger, he didn’t feel animated. He became somehow extremely bad at making any decisions at all. It would take him hours to decide on which socks to wear. He would make very bad financial decisions.</span></p><p><span>What does it say about the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_marker_hypothesis#" rel="">role of our built-in emotions in making us a viable agent</a><span>, essentially? To connect to your question about pre-training, maybe if you are good enough at getting everything out of pre-training, you could get that as well. But that’s the kind of thing which seems... Well, it may or may not be possible to get that from pre-training.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:12:56</em></p><p><span>What is “that”? Clearly not just directly emotion. It seems like some almost </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning#State-value_function" rel="">value function</a><span>-like thing which is telling you what the end reward for any decision should be. You think that doesn’t sort of implicitly come from pre-training?</span></p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:13:15</em></p><p>I think it could. I’m just saying it’s not 100% obvious.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:13:19</em></p><p><span>But what is that? How do you think about emotions? What is the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" rel="">ML</a><span> analogy for emotions?</span></p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:13:26</em></p><p>It should be some kind of a value function thing. But I don’t think there is a great ML analogy because right now, value functions don’t play a very prominent role in the things people do.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:13:36</em></p><p>It might be worth defining for the audience what a value function is, if you want to do that.</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:13:39</em></p><p><span>Certainly, I’ll be very happy to do that. When people do </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning" rel="">reinforcement learning</a><span>, the way reinforcement learning is done right now, how do people train those </span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents" rel="">agents</a><span>? You have your </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)" rel="">neural net</a><span> and you give it a problem, and then you tell the model, “Go solve it.” The model takes maybe thousands, hundreds of thousands of actions or thoughts or something, and then it produces a solution. The solution is graded.</span></p><p><span>And then the score is used to provide a training signal for every single action in your trajectory. That means that if you are doing something that goes for a long time—if you’re training a task that takes a long time to solve—it will do no learning at all until you come up with the proposed solution. That’s how reinforcement learning is done naively. That’s how </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_o1" rel="">o1</a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepSeek#R1" rel="">R1</a><span> ostensibly are done.</span></p><p>The value function says something like, “Maybe I could sometimes, not always, tell you if you are doing well or badly.” The notion of a value function is more useful in some domains than others. For example, when you play chess and you lose a piece, I messed up. You don’t need to play the whole game to know that what I just did was bad, and therefore whatever preceded it was also bad.</p><p>The value function lets you short-circuit the wait until the very end. Let’s suppose that you are doing some kind of a math thing or a programming thing, and you’re trying to explore a particular solution or direction. After, let’s say, a thousand steps of thinking, you concluded that this direction is unpromising. As soon as you conclude this, you could already get a reward signal a thousand timesteps previously, when you decided to pursue down this path. You say, “Next time I shouldn’t pursue this path in a similar situation,” long before you actually came up with the proposed solution.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:15:52</em></p><p><span>This was in the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948" rel="">DeepSeek R1 paper</a><span>— that the space of trajectories is so wide that maybe it’s hard to learn a mapping from an intermediate trajectory and value. And also given that, in coding for example you’ll have the wrong idea, then you’ll go back, then you’ll change something.</span></p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:16:12</em></p><p><span>This sounds like such a lack of faith in </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning" rel="">deep learning</a><span>. Sure it might be difficult, but nothing deep learning can’t do. My expectation is that a value function should be useful, and I fully expect that they will be used in the future, if not already.</span></p><p>What I was alluding to with the person whose emotional center got damaged, it’s more that maybe what it suggests is that the value function of humans is modulated by emotions in some important way that’s hardcoded by evolution. And maybe that is important for people to be effective in the world.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:17:00</em></p><p>That’s the thing I was planning on asking you. There’s something really interesting about emotions of the value function, which is that it’s impressive that they have this much utility while still being rather simple to understand.</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:17:15</em></p><p>I have two responses. I do agree that compared to the kind of things that we learn and the things we are talking about, the kind of AI we are talking about, emotions are relatively simple. They might even be so simple that maybe you could map them out in a human-understandable way. I think it would be cool to do.</p><p>In terms of utility though, I think there is a thing where there is this complexity-robustness tradeoff, where complex things can be very useful, but simple things are very useful in a very broad range of situations. One way to interpret what we are seeing is that we’ve got these emotions that evolved mostly from our mammal ancestors and then fine-tuned a little bit while we were hominids, just a bit. We do have a decent amount of social emotions though which mammals may lack. But they’re not very sophisticated. And because they’re not sophisticated, they serve us so well in this very different world compared to the one that we’ve been living in.</p><p>Actually, they also make mistakes. For example, our emotions… Well actually, I don’t know. Does hunger count as an emotion? It’s debatable. But I think, for example, our intuitive feeling of hunger is not succeeding in guiding us correctly in this world with an abundance of food.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:18:49</em></p><p><span>People have been talking about scaling data, scaling </span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/model-parameters" rel="">parameters</a><span>, scaling compute. Is there a more general way to think about scaling? What are the other scaling axes?</span></p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:19:00</em></p><p>Here’s a perspective that I think might be true. The way ML used to work is that people would just tinker with stuff and try to get interesting results. That’s what’s been going on in the past.</p><p><span>Then the scaling insight arrived. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_scaling_law" rel="">Scaling laws</a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3" rel="">GPT-3</a><span>, and suddenly </span><a href="https://amzn.to/4psigkM" rel="">everyone realized we should scale.</a><span> This is an example of how language affects thought. “Scaling” is just one word, but it’s such a powerful word because it informs people what to do. They say, “Let’s try to scale things.” So you say, what are we scaling? Pre-training was the thing to scale. It was a particular scaling recipe.</span></p><p>The big breakthrough of pre-training is the realization that this recipe is good. You say, “Hey, if you mix some compute with some data into a neural net of a certain size, you will get results. You will know that you’ll be better if you just scale the recipe up.” This is also great. Companies love this because it gives you a very low-risk way of investing your resources.</p><p>It’s much harder to invest your resources in research. Compare that. If you research, you need to be like, “Go forth researchers and research and come up with something”, versus get more data, get more compute. You know you’ll get something from pre-training.</p><p><span>Indeed, it looks like, based on various things some people say on Twitter, maybe </span><a href="https://x.com/OriolVinyalsML/status/1990854455802343680" rel="">it appears that Gemini have found a way to get more out of pre-training</a><span>. At some point though, </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320811/what-ilya-sutskever-sees-openai-model-data-training" rel="">pre-training will run out of data</a><span>. The data is very clearly finite. What do you do next? Either you do some kind of souped-up pre-training, a different recipe from the one you’ve done before, or you’re doing RL, or maybe something else. But now that compute is big, compute is now very big, in some sense we are back to the age of research.</span></p><p><span>Maybe here’s another way to put it. Up until 2020, from 2012 to 2020, it was the age of research. Now, from 2020 to 2025, it was the </span><a href="https://amzn.to/49vUsb0" rel="">age of scaling</a><span>—maybe plus or minus, let’s add error bars to those years—because people say, “This is amazing. You’ve got to scale more. Keep scaling.” The one word: scaling.</span></p><p>But now the scale is so big. Is the belief really, “Oh, it’s so big, but if you had 100x more, everything would be so different?” It would be different, for sure. But is the belief that if you just 100x the scale, everything would be transformed? I don’t think that’s true. So it’s back to the age of research again, just with big computers.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:22:06</em></p><p>That’s a very interesting way to put it. But let me ask you the question you just posed then. What are we scaling, and what would it mean to have a recipe? I guess I’m not aware of a very clean relationship that almost looks like a law of physics which existed in pre-training. There was a power law between data or compute or parameters and loss. What is the kind of relationship we should be seeking, and how should we think about what this new recipe might look like?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:22:38</em></p><p><span>We’ve already witnessed a transition from one type of scaling to a different type of scaling, from pre-training to RL. Now people are scaling RL. Now based on what people say on Twitter, they spend more compute on RL than on pre-training at this point, because RL can actually consume quite a bit of compute. You do very long </span><a href="https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/16596/what-is-the-definition-of-rollout-in-neural-network-or-openai-gym" rel="">rollouts</a><span>, so it takes a lot of compute to produce those rollouts. Then you get a relatively small amount of learning per rollout, so you really can spend a lot of compute.</span></p><p>I wouldn’t even call it scaling. I would say, “Hey, what are you doing? Is the thing you are doing the most productive thing you could be doing? Can you find a more productive way of using your compute?” We’ve discussed the value function business earlier. Maybe once people get good at value functions, they will be using their resources more productively. If you find a whole other way of training models, you could say, “Is this scaling or is it just using your resources?” I think it becomes a little bit ambiguous.</p><p>In the sense that, when people were in the age of research back then, it was, “Let’s try this and this and this. Let’s try that and that and that. Oh, look, something interesting is happening.” I think there will be a return to that.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:24:10</em></p><p><span>If we’re back in the era of research, stepping back, what is the part of the recipe that we need to think most about? When you say value function, people are already trying the current recipe, but then having </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15594" rel="">LLM-as-a-Judge</a><span> and so forth. You could say that’s a value function, but it sounds like you have something much more fundamental in mind. Should we even rethink pre-training at all and not just add more steps to the end of that process?</span></p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:24:35</em></p><p>The discussion about value function, I think it was interesting. I want to emphasize that I think the value function is something that’s going to make RL more efficient, and I think that makes a difference. But I think anything you can do with a value function, you can do without, just more slowly. The thing which I think is the most fundamental is that these models somehow just generalize dramatically worse than people. It’s super obvious. That seems like a very fundamental thing.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:25:13</em></p><p><span>So this is the crux: generalization. There are two sub-questions. There’s one which is about </span><a href="https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/5246/what-is-sample-efficiency-and-how-can-importance-sampling-be-used-to-achieve-it" rel="">sample efficiency</a><span>: why should it take so much more data for these models to learn than humans? There’s a second question. Even separate from the amount of data it takes, why is it so hard to teach the thing we want to a model than to a human? For a human, we don’t necessarily need a verifiable reward to be able to… You’re probably mentoring a bunch of researchers right now, and you’re talking with them, you’re showing them your code, and you’re showing them how you think. From that, they’re picking up your way of thinking and how they should do research.</span></p><p><span>You don’t have to set a verifiable reward for them that’s like, “Okay, this is the next part of the curriculum, and now this is the next part of your curriculum. Oh, this training was unstable.” There’s not this schleppy, bespoke process. Perhaps these two issues are actually related in some way, but I’d be curious to explore this second thing, which is more like </span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/continual-learning" rel="">continual learning</a><span>, and this first thing, which feels just like sample efficiency.</span></p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:26:19</em></p><p>You could actually wonder that one possible explanation for the human sample efficiency that needs to be considered is evolution. Evolution has given us a small amount of the most useful information possible. For things like vision, hearing, and locomotion, I think there’s a pretty strong case that evolution has given us a lot.</p><p>For example, human dexterity far exceeds… I mean robots can become dexterous too if you subject them to a huge amount of training in simulation. But to train a robot in the real world to quickly pick up a new skill like a person does seems very out of reach. Here you could say, “Oh yeah, locomotion. All our ancestors needed great locomotion, squirrels. So with locomotion, maybe we’ve got some unbelievable prior.”</p><p><span>You could make the same case for vision. I believe </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun" rel="">Yann LeCun</a><span> made the point that children learn to drive after 10 hours of practice, which is true. But our vision is so good. At least for me, I remember myself being a five-year-old. I was very excited about cars back then. I’m pretty sure my car recognition was more than adequate for driving already as a five-year-old. You don’t get to see that much data as a five-year-old. You spend most of your time in your parents’ house, so you have very low data diversity.</span></p><p>But you could say maybe that’s evolution too. But in language and math and coding, probably not.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:28:00</em></p><p>It still seems better than models. Obviously, models are better than the average human at language, math, and coding. But are they better than the average human at learning?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:28:09</em></p><p>Oh yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely. What I meant to say is that language, math, and coding—and especially math and coding—suggests that whatever it is that makes people good at learning is probably not so much a complicated prior, but something more, some fundamental thing.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:28:29</em></p><p>I’m not sure I understood. Why should that be the case?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:28:32</em></p><p>So consider a skill in which people exhibit some kind of great reliability. If the skill is one that was very useful to our ancestors for many millions of years, hundreds of millions of years, you could argue that maybe humans are good at it because of evolution, because we have a prior, an evolutionary prior that’s encoded in some very non-obvious way that somehow makes us so good at it.</p><p>But if people exhibit great ability, reliability, robustness, and ability to learn in a domain that really did not exist until recently, then this is more an indication that people might have just better machine learning, period.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:29:29</em></p><p>How should we think about what that is? What is the ML analogy? There are a couple of interesting things about it. It takes fewer samples. It’s more unsupervised. A child learning to drive a car… Children are not learning to drive a car. A teenager learning how to drive a car is not exactly getting some prebuilt, verifiable reward. It comes from their interaction with the machine and with the environment. It takes much fewer samples. It seems more unsupervised. It seems more robust?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:30:07</em></p><p>Much more robust. The robustness of people is really staggering.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:30:12</em></p><p>Do you have a unified way of thinking about why all these things are happening at once? What is the ML analogy that could realize something like this?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:30:24</em></p><p>One of the things that you’ve been asking about is how can the teenage driver self-correct and learn from their experience without an external teacher? The answer is that they have their value function. They have a general sense which is also, by the way, extremely robust in people. Whatever the human value function is, with a few exceptions around addiction, it’s actually very, very robust.</p><p>So for something like a teenager that’s learning to drive, they start to drive, and they already have a sense of how they’re driving immediately, how badly they are, how unconfident. And then they see, “Okay.” And then, of course, the learning speed of any teenager is so fast. After 10 hours, you’re good to go.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:31:17</em></p><p>It seems like humans have some solution, but I’m curious about how they are doing it and why is it so hard? How do we need to reconceptualize the way we’re training models to make something like this possible?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:31:27</em></p><p>That is a great question to ask, and it’s a question I have a lot of opinions about. But unfortunately, we live in a world where not all machine learning ideas are discussed freely, and this is one of them. There’s probably a way to do it. I think it can be done. The fact that people are like that, I think it’s a proof that it can be done.</p><p>There may be another blocker though, which is that there is a possibility that the human neurons do more compute than we think. If that is true, and if that plays an important role, then things might be more difficult. But regardless, I do think it points to the existence of some machine learning principle that I have opinions on. But unfortunately, circumstances make it hard to discuss in detail.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:32:28</em></p><p>Nobody listens to this podcast, Ilya.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:35:45</em></p><p>I’m curious. If you say we are back in an era of research, you were there from 2012 to 2020. What is the vibe now going to be if we go back to the era of research?</p><p><span>For example, even after </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet" rel="">AlexNet</a><span>, the amount of compute that was used to run experiments kept increasing, and the size of frontier systems kept increasing. Do you think now that this era of research will still require tremendous amounts of compute? Do you think it will require going back into the archives and reading old papers?</span></p><p>You were at Google and OpenAI and Stanford, these places, when there was more of a vibe of research? What kind of things should we be expecting in the community?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:36:38</em></p><p>One consequence of the age of scaling is that scaling sucked out all the air in the room. Because scaling sucked out all the air in the room, everyone started to do the same thing. We got to the point where we are in a world where there are more companies than ideas by quite a bit. Actually on that, there is this Silicon Valley saying that says that ideas are cheap, execution is everything. People say that a lot, and there is truth to that. But then I saw someone say on Twitter something like, “If ideas are so cheap, how come no one’s having any ideas?” And I think it’s true too.</p><p>If you think about research progress in terms of bottlenecks, there are several bottlenecks. One of them is ideas, and one of them is your ability to bring them to life, which might be compute but also engineering. If you go back to the ‘90s, let’s say, you had people who had pretty good ideas, and if they had much larger computers, maybe they could demonstrate that their ideas were viable. But they could not, so they could only have a very, very small demonstration that did not convince anyone. So the bottleneck was compute.</p><p><span>Then in the age of scaling, compute has increased a lot. Of course, there is a question of how much compute is needed, but compute is large. Compute is large enough such that it’s not obvious that you need that much more compute to prove some idea. I’ll give you an analogy. AlexNet was built on two </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit" rel="">GPUs</a><span>. That was the total amount of compute used for it. The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning)" rel="">transformer</a><span> was built on 8 to 64 GPUs. No single transformer paper experiment used more than 64 GPUs of 2017, which would be like, what, two GPUs of today? The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network" rel="">ResNet</a><span>, right? You could argue that the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_o1" rel="">o1 reasoning</a><span> was not the most compute-heavy thing in the world.</span></p><p>So for research, you definitely need some amount of compute, but it’s far from obvious that you need the absolutely largest amount of compute ever for research. You might argue, and I think it is true, that if you want to build the absolutely best system then it helps to have much more compute. Especially if everyone is within the same paradigm, then compute becomes one of the big differentiators.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:39:41</em></p><p>I’m asking you for the history, because you were actually there. I’m not sure what actually happened. It sounds like it was possible to develop these ideas using minimal amounts of compute. But the transformer didn’t immediately become famous. It became the thing everybody started doing and then started experimenting on top of and building on top of because it was validated at higher and higher levels of compute.</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:40:06</em></p><p>Correct.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:40:07</em></p><p><span>And if you at </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_Superintelligence_Inc." rel="">SSI</a><span> have 50 different ideas, how will you know which one is the next transformer and which one is brittle, without having the kinds of compute that other frontier labs have?</span></p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:40:22</em></p><p>I can comment on that. The short comment is that you mentioned SSI. Specifically for us, the amount of compute that SSI has for research is really not that small. I want to explain why. Simple math can explain why the amount of compute that we have is comparable for research than one might think. I’ll explain.</p><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/12/openai-co-founder-ilya-sutskevers-safe-superintelligence-reportedly-valued-at-32b/" rel="">SSI has raised $3 billion</a><span>, which is a lot by any absolute sense. But you could say, “Look at the other companies raising much more.” But a lot of their compute goes for </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-ai-inference" rel="">inference</a><span>. These big numbers, these big loans, it’s earmarked for inference. That’s number one. Number two, if you want to have a product on which you do inference, you need to have a big staff of engineers, salespeople. A lot of the research needs to be dedicated to producing all kinds of product-related features. So then when you look at what’s actually left for research, the difference becomes a lot smaller.</span></p><p>The other thing is, if you are doing something different, do you really need the absolute maximal scale to prove it? I don’t think that’s true at all. I think that in our case, we have sufficient compute to prove, to convince ourselves and anyone else, that what we are doing is correct.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:42:02</em></p><p>There have been public estimates that companies like OpenAI spend on the order of $5-6 billion a year just so far, on experiments. This is separate from the amount of money they’re spending on inference and so forth. So it seems like they’re spending more a year running research experiments than you guys have in total funding.</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:42:22</em></p><p>I think it’s a question of what you do with it. It’s a question of what you do with it. In their case, in the case of others, there is a lot more demand on the training compute. There’s a lot more different work streams, there are different modalities, there is just more stuff. So it becomes fragmented.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:42:44</em></p><p>How will SSI make money?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:42:46</em></p><p>My answer to this question is something like this. Right now, we just focus on the research, and then the answer to that question will reveal itself. I think there will be lots of possible answers.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:43:01</em></p><p>Is SSI’s plan still to straight shot superintelligence?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:43:04</em></p><p>Maybe. I think that there is merit to it. I think there’s a lot of merit because it’s very nice to not be affected by the day-to-day market competition. But I think there are two reasons that may cause us to change the plan. One is pragmatic, if timelines turned out to be long, which they might. Second, I think there is a lot of value in the best and most powerful AI being out there impacting the world. I think this is a meaningfully valuable thing.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:43:48</em></p><p>So then why is your default plan to straight shot superintelligence? Because it sounds like OpenAI, Anthropic, all these other companies, their explicit thinking is, “Look, we have weaker and weaker intelligences that the public can get used to and prepare for.” Why is it potentially better to build a superintelligence directly?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:44:08</em></p><p>I’ll make the case for and against. The case for is that one of the challenges that people face when they’re in the market is that they have to participate in the rat race. The rat race is quite difficult in that it exposes you to difficult trade-offs which you need to make. It is nice to say, “We’ll insulate ourselves from all this and just focus on the research and come out only when we are ready, and not before.” But the counterpoint is valid too, and those are opposing forces. The counterpoint is, “Hey, it is useful for the world to see powerful AI. It is useful for the world to see powerful AI because that’s the only way you can communicate it.”</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:44:57</em></p><p>Well, I guess not even just that you can communicate the idea—</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:45:00</em></p><p>Communicate the AI, not the idea. Communicate the AI.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:45:04</em></p><p>What do you mean, “communicate the AI”?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:45:06</em></p><p>Let’s suppose you write an essay about AI, and the essay says, “AI is going to be this, and AI is going to be that, and it’s going to be this.” You read it and you say, “Okay, this is an interesting essay.” Now suppose you see an AI doing this, an AI doing that. It is incomparable. Basically I think that there is a big benefit from AI being in the public, and that would be a reason for us to not be quite straight shot.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:45:37</em></p><p><span>I guess it’s not even that, but I do think that is an important part of it. The other big thing is that I can’t think of another discipline in human engineering and research where the end artifact was made safer mostly through just thinking about how to make it safe, as opposed to, why airplane crashes per mile are so much lower today than they were decades ago. Why is it so much harder to find a bug in </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" rel="">Linux</a><span> than it would have been decades ago? I think it’s mostly because these systems were deployed to the world. You noticed failures, those failures were corrected and the systems became more robust.</span></p><p><span>I’m not sure why AGI and superhuman intelligence would be any different, especially given—and I hope we’re going to get to this—it seems like the harms of superintelligence are not just about having some </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer" rel="">malevolent paper clipper</a><span> out there. But this is a really powerful thing and we don’t even know how to conceptualize how people interact with it, what people will do with it. Having gradual access to it seems like a better way to maybe spread out the impact of it and to help people prepare for it.</span></p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:46:47</em></p><p>Well I think on this point, even in the straight shot scenario, you would still do a gradual release of it, that’s how I would imagine it. Gradualism would be an inherent component of any plan. It’s just a question of what is the first thing that you get out of the door. That’s number one.</p><p><span>Number two, I believe </span><a href="https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/timelines-june-2025" rel="">you have advocated for continual learning more than other people</a><span>, and I actually think that this is an important and correct thing. Here is why. I’ll give you another example of how language affects thinking. In this case, it will be two words that have shaped everyone’s thinking, I maintain. First word: </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence" rel="">AGI</a><span>. Second word: pre-training. Let me explain.</span></p><p><span>The term AGI, why does this term exist? It’s a very particular term. Why does it exist? There’s a reason. The reason that the term AGI exists is, in my opinion, not so much because it’s a very important, essential descriptor of some end state of intelligence, but because it is a reaction to a different term that existed, and the term is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_artificial_intelligence" rel="">narrow AI</a><span>. If you go back to ancient history of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_video_games" rel="">gameplay and AI</a><span>, of </span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/history/early-games" rel="">checkers AI</a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_chess_engines" rel="">chess AI</a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaStar_(software)" rel="">computer games AI</a><span>, everyone would say, look at this narrow intelligence. Sure, the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov" rel="">chess AI can beat Kasparov</a><span>, but it can’t do anything else. It is so narrow, artificial narrow intelligence. So in response, as a reaction to this, some people said, this is not good. It is so narrow. What we need is general AI, an AI that can just do all the things. That term just got a lot of traction.</span></p><p>The second thing that got a lot of traction is pre-training, specifically the recipe of pre-training. I think the way people do RL now is maybe undoing the conceptual imprint of pre-training. But pre-training had this property. You do more pre-training and the model gets better at everything, more or less uniformly. General AI. Pre-training gives AGI.</p><p>But the thing that happened with AGI and pre-training is that in some sense they overshot the target. If you think about the term “AGI”, especially in the context of pre-training, you will realize that a human being is not an AGI. Yes, there is definitely a foundation of skills, but a human being lacks a huge amount of knowledge. Instead, we rely on continual learning.</p><p>So when you think about, “Okay, so let’s suppose that we achieve success and we produce some kind of safe superintelligence.” The question is, how do you define it? Where on the curve of continual learning is it going to be?</p><p>I produce a superintelligent 15-year-old that’s very eager to go. They don’t know very much at all, a great student, very eager. You go and be a programmer, you go and be a doctor, go and learn. So you could imagine that the deployment itself will involve some kind of a learning trial-and-error period. It’s a process, as opposed to you dropping the finished thing.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:50:45</em></p><p><span>I see. You’re suggesting that the thing you’re pointing out with superintelligence is not some finished mind which knows how to do every single job in the economy. Because the way, say, the original </span><a href="https://openai.com/charter/" rel="">OpenAI charter</a><span> or whatever defines AGI is like, it can do every single job, every single thing a human can do. You’re proposing instead a mind which can learn to do every single job, and that is superintelligence.</span></p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:51:15</em></p><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:51:16</em></p><p>But once you have the learning algorithm, it gets deployed into the world the same way a human laborer might join an organization.</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:51:25</em></p><p>Exactly.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:51:26</em></p><p>It seems like one of these two things might happen, maybe neither of these happens. One, this super-efficient learning algorithm becomes superhuman, becomes as good as you and potentially even better, at the task of ML research. As a result the algorithm itself becomes more and more superhuman.</p><p>The other is, even if that doesn’t happen, if you have a single model—this is explicitly your vision—where instances of a model which are deployed through the economy doing different jobs, learning how to do those jobs, continually learning on the job, picking up all the skills that any human could pick up, but picking them all up at the same time, and then amalgamating their learnings, you basically have a model which functionally becomes superintelligent even without any sort of recursive self-improvement in software. Because you now have one model that can do every single job in the economy and humans can’t merge our minds in the same way. So do you expect some sort of intelligence explosion from broad deployment?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:52:30</em></p><p>I think that it is likely that we will have rapid economic growth. I think with broad deployment, there are two arguments you could make which are conflicting. One is that once indeed you get to a point where you have an AI that can learn to do things quickly and you have many of them, then there will be a strong force to deploy them in the economy unless there will be some kind of a regulation that stops it, which by the way there might be.</p><p>But the idea of very rapid economic growth for some time, I think it’s very possible from broad deployment. The question is how rapid it’s going to be. I think this is hard to know because on the one hand you have this very efficient worker. On the other hand, the world is just really big and there’s a lot of stuff, and that stuff moves at a different speed. But then on the other hand, now the AI could… So I think very rapid economic growth is possible. We will see all kinds of things like different countries with different rules and the ones which have the friendlier rules, the economic growth will be faster. Hard to predict.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>00:55:07</em></p><p>It seems to me that this is a very precarious situation to be in. In the limit, we know that this should be possible. If you have something that is as good as a human at learning, but which can merge its brains—merge different instances in a way that humans can’t merge—already, this seems like a thing that should physically be possible. Humans are possible, digital computers are possible. You just need both of those combined to produce this thing.</p><p><span>It also seems this kind of thing is extremely powerful. Economic growth is one way to put it. A </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere" rel="">Dyson sphere</a><span> is a lot of economic growth. But another way to put it is that you will have, in potentially a very short period of time... You hire people at SSI, and in six months, they’re net productive, probably. A human learns really fast, and this thing is becoming smarter and smarter very fast. How do you think about making that go well? Why is SSI positioned to do that well? What is SSI’s plan there, is basically what I’m trying to ask.</span></p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>00:56:10</em></p><p>One of the ways in which my thinking has been changing is that I now place more importance on AI being deployed incrementally and in advance. One very difficult thing about AI is that we are talking about systems that don’t yet exist and it’s hard to imagine them.</p><p>I think that one of the things that’s happening is that in practice, it’s very hard to feel the AGI. It’s very hard to feel the AGI. We can talk about it, but imagine having a conversation about how it is like to be old when you’re old and frail. You can have a conversation, you can try to imagine it, but it’s just hard, and you come back to reality where that’s not the case. I think that a lot of the issues around AGI and its future power stem from the fact that it’s very difficult to imagine. Future AI is going to be different. It’s going to be powerful. Indeed, the whole problem, what is the problem of AI and AGI? The whole problem is the power. The whole problem is the power.</p><p>When the power is really big, what’s going to happen? One of the ways in which I’ve changed my mind over the past year—and that change of mind, I’ll hedge a little bit, may back-propagate into the plans of our company—is that if it’s hard to imagine, what do you do? You’ve got to be showing the thing. You’ve got to be showing the thing. I maintain that most people who work on AI also can’t imagine it because it’s too different from what people see on a day-to-day basis.</p><p><span>I do maintain, here’s something which I predict will happen. This is a prediction. I maintain that as AI becomes more powerful, people will change their behaviors. We will see all kinds of unprecedented things which are not happening right now. I’ll give some examples. I think for better or worse, the frontier companies will play a very important role in what happens, as will the government. The kind of things that I think you’ll see, which you see the beginnings of, are companies that are fierce competitors starting to collaborate on AI safety. You may have seen </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/openai-co-founder-calls-for-ai-labs-to-safety-test-rival-models/" rel="">OpenAI and Anthropic doing a first small step</a><span>, but that did not exist. That’s something which I predicted in one of my talks about three years ago, that such a thing will happen. I also maintain that as AI continues to become more powerful, more visibly powerful, there will also be a desire from governments and the public to do something. I think this is a very important force, of showing the AI.</span></p><p>That’s number one. Number two, okay, so the AI is being built. What needs to be done? One thing that I maintain that will happen is that right now, people who are working on AI, I maintain that the AI doesn’t feel powerful because of its mistakes. I do think that at some point the AI will start to feel powerful actually. I think when that happens, we will see a big change in the way all AI companies approach safety. They’ll become much more paranoid. I say this as a prediction that we will see happen. We’ll see if I’m right. But I think this is something that will happen because they will see the AI becoming more powerful. Everything that’s happening right now, I maintain, is because people look at today’s AI and it’s hard to imagine the future AI.</p><p>There is a third thing which needs to happen. I’m talking about it in broader terms, not just from the perspective of SSI because you asked me about our company. The question is, what should the companies aspire to build? What should they aspire to build? There has been one big idea that everyone has been locked into, which is the self-improving AI. Why did it happen? Because there are fewer ideas than companies. But I maintain that there is something that’s better to build, and I think that everyone will want that.</p><p><span>It’s the AI that’s robustly aligned to care about sentient life specifically. I think in particular, there’s a case to be made that it will be easier to build an AI that cares about sentient life than an AI that cares about human life alone, because the AI itself will be sentient. And if you think about things like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron" rel="">mirror neurons</a><span> and </span><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-animal/" rel="">human empathy for animals</a><span>, which you might argue it’s not big enough, but it exists. I think it’s an emergent property from the fact that we model others with the same circuit that we use to model ourselves, because that’s the most efficient thing to do.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:02:06</em></p><p><span>So even if you got an AI to care about sentient beings—and it’s not actually clear to me that that’s what you should try to do if you solved </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment" rel="">alignment</a><span>—it would still be the case that most sentient beings will be AIs. There will be trillions, eventually quadrillions, of AIs. Humans will be a very small fraction of sentient beings. So it’s not clear to me if the goal is some kind of human control over this future civilization, that this is the best criterion.</span></p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:02:37</em></p><p>It’s true. It’s possible it’s not the best criterion. I’ll say two things. Number one, care for sentient life, I think there is merit to it. It should be considered. I think it would be helpful if there was some kind of short list of ideas that the companies, when they are in this situation, could use. That’s number two.</p><p>Number three, I think it would be really materially helpful if the power of the most powerful superintelligence was somehow capped because it would address a lot of these concerns. The question of how to do it, I’m not sure, but I think that would be materially helpful when you’re talking about really, really powerful systems.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:03:35</em></p><p>Before we continue the alignment discussion, I want to double-click on that. How much room is there at the top? How do you think about superintelligence? Do you think, using this learning efficiency idea, maybe it is just extremely fast at learning new skills or new knowledge? Does it just have a bigger pool of strategies? Is there a single cohesive “it” in the center that’s more powerful or bigger? If so, do you imagine that this will be sort of godlike in comparison to the rest of human civilization, or does it just feel like another agent, or another cluster of agents?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:04:10</em></p><p>This is an area where different people have different intuitions. I think it will be very powerful, for sure. What I think is most likely to happen is that there will be multiple such AIs being created roughly at the same time. I think that if the cluster is big enough—like if the cluster is literally continent-sized—that thing could be really powerful, indeed. If you literally have a continent-sized cluster, those AIs can be very powerful. All I can tell you is that if you’re talking about extremely powerful AIs, truly dramatically powerful, it would be nice if they could be restrained in some ways or if there were some kind of agreement or something.</p><p>What is the concern of superintelligence? What is one way to explain the concern? If you imagine a system that is sufficiently powerful, really sufficiently powerful—and you could say you need to do something sensible like care for sentient life in a very single-minded way—we might not like the results. That’s really what it is.</p><p>Maybe, by the way, the answer is that you do not build an RL agent in the usual sense. I’ll point several things out. I think human beings are semi-RL agents. We pursue a reward, and then the emotions or whatever make us tire out of the reward and we pursue a different reward. The market is a very short-sighted kind of agent. Evolution is the same. Evolution is very intelligent in some ways, but very dumb in other ways. The government has been designed to be a never-ending fight between three parts, which has an effect. So I think things like this.</p><p>Another thing that makes this discussion difficult is that we are talking about systems that don’t exist, that we don’t know how to build. That’s the other thing and that’s actually my belief. I think what people are doing right now will go some distance and then peter out. It will continue to improve, but it will also not be “it”. The “It” we don’t know how to build, and a lot hinges on understanding reliable generalization.</p><p>I’ll say another thing. One of the things that you could say about what causes alignment to be difficult is that your ability to learn human values is fragile. Then your ability to optimize them is fragile. You actually learn to optimize them. And can’t you say, “Are these not all instances of unreliable generalization?” Why is it that human beings appear to generalize so much better? What if generalization was much better? What would happen in this case? What would be the effect? But those questions are right now still unanswerable.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:07:21</em></p><p>How does one think about what AI going well looks like? You’ve scoped out how AI might evolve. We’ll have these sort of continual learning agents. AI will be very powerful. Maybe there will be many different AIs. How do you think about lots of continent-sized compute intelligences going around? How dangerous is that? How do we make that less dangerous? And how do we do that in a way that protects an equilibrium where there might be misaligned AIs out there and bad actors out there?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:07:58</em></p><p>Here’s one reason why I liked “AI that cares for sentient life”. We can debate on whether it’s good or bad. But if the first N of these dramatic systems do care for, love, humanity or something, care for sentient life, obviously this also needs to be achieved. This needs to be achieved. So if this is achieved by the first N of those systems, then I can see it go well, at least for quite some time.</p><p>Then there is the question of what happens in the long run. How do you achieve a long-run equilibrium? I think that there, there is an answer as well. I don’t like this answer, but it needs to be considered.</p><p>In the long run, you might say, “Okay, if you have a world where powerful AIs exist, in the short term, you could say you have universal high income. You have universal high income and we’re all doing well.” But what do the Buddhists say? “Change is the only constant.” Things change. There is some kind of government, political structure thing, and it changes because these things have a shelf life. Some new government thing comes up and it functions, and then after some time it stops functioning. That’s something that we see happening all the time.</p><p>So I think for the long-run equilibrium, one approach is that you could say maybe every person will have an AI that will do their bidding, and that’s good. If that could be maintained indefinitely, that’s true. But the downside with that is then the AI goes and earns money for the person and advocates for their needs in the political sphere, and maybe then writes a little report saying, “Okay, here’s what I’ve done, here’s the situation,” and the person says, “Great, keep it up.” But the person is no longer a participant. Then you can say that’s a precarious place to be in.</p><p><span>I’m going to preface by saying I don’t like this solution, but it is a solution. The solution is if people become part-AI with some kind of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink" rel="">Neuralink</a><span>++. Because what will happen as a result is that now the AI understands something, and we understand it too, because now the understanding is transmitted wholesale. So now if the AI is in some situation, you are involved in that situation yourself fully. I think this is the answer to the equilibrium.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:10:47</em></p><p>I wonder if the fact that emotions which were developed millions—or in many cases, billions—of years ago in a totally different environment are still guiding our actions so strongly is an example of alignment success.</p><p><span>To spell out what I mean—I don’t know whether it’s more accurate to call it a value function or reward function—but the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem" rel="">brainstem</a><span> has a directive where it’s saying, “Mate with somebody who’s more successful.” The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex" rel="">cortex</a><span> is the part that understands what success means in the modern context. But the brainstem is able to align the cortex and say, “However you recognize success to be—and I’m not smart enough to understand what that is— you’re still going to pursue this directive.”</span></p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:11:36</em></p><p>I think there’s a more general point. I think it’s actually really mysterious how evolution encodes high-level desires. It’s pretty easy to understand how evolution would endow us with the desire for food that smells good because smell is a chemical, so just pursue that chemical. It’s very easy to imagine evolution doing that thing.</p><p>But evolution also has endowed us with all these social desires. We really care about being seen positively by society. We care about being in good standing. All these social intuitions that we have, I feel strongly that they’re baked in. I don’t know how evolution did it because it’s a high-level concept that’s represented in the brain.</p><p>Let’s say you care about some social thing, it’s not a low-level signal like smell. It’s not something for which there is a sensor. The brain needs to do a lot of processing to piece together lots of bits of information to understand what’s going on socially. Somehow evolution said, “That’s what you should care about.” How did it do it?</p><p>It did it quickly, too. All these sophisticated social things that we care about, I think they evolved pretty recently. Evolution had an easy time hard-coding this high-level desire. I’m unaware of a good hypothesis for how it’s done. I had some ideas I was kicking around, but none of them are satisfying.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:13:26</em></p><p>What’s especially impressive is it was desire that you learned in your lifetime, it makes sense because your brain is intelligent. It makes sense why you would be able to learn intelligent desires. Maybe this is not your point, but one way to understand it is that the desire is built into the genome, and the genome is not intelligent. But you’re somehow able to describe this feature. It’s not even clear how you define that feature, and you can build it into the genes.</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:13:55</em></p><p>Essentially, or maybe I’ll put it differently. If you think about the tools that are available to the genome, it says, “Okay, here’s a recipe for building a brain.” You could say, “Here is a recipe for connecting the dopamine neurons to the smell sensor.” And if the smell is a certain kind of good smell, you want to eat that.</p><p>I could imagine the genome doing that. I’m claiming that it is harder to imagine. It’s harder to imagine the genome saying you should care about some complicated computation that your entire brain, a big chunk of your brain, does. That’s all I’m claiming. I can tell you a speculation of how it could be done. Let me offer a speculation, and I’ll explain why the speculation is probably false.</p><p><span>So the brain has brain regions. We have our </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex" rel="">cortex</a><span>. It has all those brain regions. The cortex is uniform, but the brain regions and the neurons in the cortex kind of speak to their neighbors mostly. That explains why you get brain regions. Because if you want to do some kind of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_processing_in_the_brain" rel="">speech processing</a><span>, all the neurons that do speech need to talk to each other. And because neurons can only speak to their nearby neighbors, for the most part, it has to be a region.</span></p><p>All the regions are mostly located in the same place from person to person. So maybe evolution hard-coded literally a location on the brain. So it says, “Oh, when the GPS coordinates of the brain such and such, when that fires, that’s what you should care about.” Maybe that’s what evolution did because that would be within the toolkit of evolution.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:15:35</em></p><p>Yeah, although there are examples where, for example, people who are born blind have that area of their cortex adopted by another sense. I have no idea, but I’d be surprised if the desires or the reward functions which require a visual signal no longer worked for people who have their different areas of their cortex co-opted.</p><p>For example, if you no longer have vision, can you still feel the sense that I want people around me to like me and so forth, which usually there are also visual cues for.</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:16:12</em></p><p>I fully agree with that. I think there’s an even stronger counterargument to this theory. There are people who get half of their brains removed in childhood, and they still have all their brain regions. But they all somehow move to just one hemisphere, which suggests that the brain regions, their location is not fixed and so that theory is not true.</p><p>It would have been cool if it was true, but it’s not. So I think that’s a mystery. But it’s an interesting mystery. The fact is that somehow evolution was able to endow us to care about social stuff very, very reliably. Even people who have all kinds of strange mental conditions and deficiencies and emotional problems tend to care about this also.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:18:13</em></p><p>What is SSI planning on doing differently? Presumably your plan is to be one of the frontier companies when this time arrives. Presumably you started SSI because you’re like, “I think I have a way of approaching how to do this safely in a way that the other companies don’t.” What is that difference?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:18:36</em></p><p>The way I would describe it is that there are some ideas that I think are promising and I want to investigate them and see if they are indeed promising or not. It’s really that simple. It’s an attempt. If the ideas turn out to be correct—these ideas that we discussed around understanding generalization—then I think we will have something worthy.</p><p>Will they turn out to be correct? We are doing research. We are squarely an “age of research” company. We are making progress. We’ve actually made quite good progress over the past year, but we need to keep making more progress, more research. That’s how I see it. I see it as an attempt to be a voice and a participant.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:19:29</em></p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/03/ilya-sutskever-is-ceo-of-safe-superintelligence-after-meta-hired-gross.html" rel="">Your cofounder and previous CEO left to go to Meta recently</a><span>, and people have asked, “Well, if there were a lot of breakthroughs being made, that seems like a thing that should have been unlikely.” I wonder how you respond.</span></p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:19:45</em></p><p><span>For this, I will simply remind a few facts that may have been forgotten. I think these facts which provide the context explain the situation. The context was that we were fundraising at a $32 billion valuation, and then </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/690720/meta-buy-thinking-machines-perplexity-safe-superintelligence" rel="">Meta came in and offered to acquire us</a><span>, and I said no. But my former cofounder in some sense said yes. As a result, he also was able to enjoy a lot of near-term liquidity, and he was the only person from SSI to join Meta.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:20:27</em></p><p>It sounds like SSI’s plan is to be a company that is at the frontier when you get to this very important period in human history where you have superhuman intelligence. You have these ideas about how to make superhuman intelligence go well. But other companies will be trying their own ideas. What distinguishes SSI’s approach to making superintelligence go well?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:20:49</em></p><p>The main thing that distinguishes SSI is its technical approach. We have a different technical approach that I think is worthy and we are pursuing it.</p><p>I maintain that in the end there will be a convergence of strategies. I think there will be a convergence of strategies where at some point, as AI becomes more powerful, it’s going to become more or less clearer to everyone what the strategy should be. It should be something like, you need to find some way to talk to each other and you want your first actual real superintelligent AI to be aligned and somehow care for sentient life, care for people, democratic, one of those, some combination thereof.</p><p><span>I think this is the condition that everyone should strive for. That’s what SSI is striving for. I think that this time, if not already, all the other companies will realize that they’re striving towards the same thing.</span><strong> </strong><span>We’ll see. I think that the world will truly change as AI becomes more powerful. I think things will be really different and people will be acting really differently.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:22:14</em></p><p>Speaking of forecasts, what are your forecasts to this system you’re describing, which can learn as well as a human and subsequently, as a result, become superhuman?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:22:26</em></p><p>I think like 5 to 20.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:22:28</em></p><p>5 to 20 years?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:22:29</em></p><p>Mhm.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:22:30</em></p><p>I just want to unroll how you might see the world coming. It’s like, we have a couple more years where these other companies are continuing the current approach and it stalls out. “Stalls out” here meaning they earn no more than low hundreds of billions in revenue? How do you think about what stalling out means?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:22:49</em></p><p>I think stalling out will look like…it will all look very similar among all the different companies. It could be something like this. I’m not sure because I think even with stalling out, I think these companies could make a stupendous revenue. Maybe not profits because they will need to work hard to differentiate each other from themselves, but revenue definitely.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:23:20</em></p><p>But something in your model implies that when the correct solution does emerge, there will be convergence between all the companies. I’m curious why you think that’s the case.</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:23:32</em></p><p>I was talking more about convergence on their alignment strategies. I think eventual convergence on the technical approach is probably going to happen as well, but I was alluding to convergence to the alignment strategies. What exactly is the thing that should be done?</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:23:46</em></p><p><span>I just want to better understand how you see the future unrolling. Currently, we have these different companies, and you expect their approach to continue generating revenue but not get to this human-like learner. So now we have these different forks of companies. We have you, we have </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_Machines_Lab" rel="">Thinking Machines</a><span>, there’s a bunch of other labs. Maybe one of them figures out the correct approach. But then the release of their product makes it clear to other people how to do this thing.</span></p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:24:09</em></p><p>I think it won’t be clear how to do it, but it will be clear that something different is possible, and that is information. People will then be trying to figure out how that works. I do think though that one of the things not addressed here, not discussed, is that with each increase in the AI’s capabilities, I think there will be some kind of changes, but I don’t know exactly which ones, in how things are being done. I think it’s going to be important, yet I can’t spell out what that is exactly.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:24:49</em></p><p>By default, you would expect the company that has that model to be getting all these gains because they have the model that has the skills and knowledge that it’s building up in the world. What is the reason to think that the benefits of that would be widely distributed and not just end up at whatever model company gets this continuous learning loop going first?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:25:13</em></p><p>Here is what I think is going to happen. Number one, let’s look at how things have gone so far with the AIs of the past. One company produced an advance and the other company scrambled and produced some similar things after some amount of time and they started to compete in the market and push the prices down. So I think from the market perspective, something similar will happen there as well.</p><p>We are talking about the good world, by the way. What’s the good world? It’s where we have these powerful human-like learners that are also… By the way, maybe there’s another thing we haven’t discussed on the spec of the superintelligent AI that I think is worth considering. It’s that you make it narrow, it can be useful and narrow at the same time. You can have lots of narrow superintelligent AIs.</p><p>But suppose you have many of them and you have some company that’s producing a lot of profits from it. Then you have another company that comes in and starts to compete. The way the competition is going to work is through specialization. Competition loves specialization. You see it in the market, you see it in evolution as well. You’re going to have lots of different niches and you’re going to have lots of different companies who are occupying different niches. In this world we might say one AI company is really quite a bit better at some area of really complicated economic activity and a different company is better at another area. And the third company is really good at litigation.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:27:18</em></p><p>Isn’t this contradicted by what human-like learning implies? It’s that it can learn…</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:27:21</em></p><p>It can, but you have accumulated learning. You have a big investment. You spent a lot of compute to become really, really good, really phenomenal at this thing. Someone else spent a huge amount of compute and a huge amount of experience to get really good at some other thing. You apply a lot of human learning to get there, but now you are at this high point where someone else would say, “Look, I don’t want to start learning what you’ve learned.”</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:27:48</em></p><p>I guess that would require many different companies to begin at the human-like continual learning agent at the same time so that they can start their different tree search in different branches. But if one company gets that agent first, or gets that learner first, it does then seem like… Well, if you just think about every single job in the economy, having an instance learning each one seems tractable for a company.</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:28:19</em></p><p>That’s a valid argument. My strong intuition is that it’s not how it’s going to go. The argument says it will go this way, but my strong intuition is that it will not go this way. In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is. I think that’s going to be one of those.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:28:41</em></p><p>A lot of people’s models of recursive self-improvement literally, explicitly state we will have a million Ilyas in a server that are coming up with different ideas, and this will lead to a superintelligence emerging very fast.</p><p>Do you have some intuition about how parallelizable the thing you are doing is? What are the gains from making copies of Ilya?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:29:02</em></p><p>I don’t know. I think there’ll definitely be diminishing returns because you want people who think differently rather than the same. If there were literal copies of me, I’m not sure how much more incremental value you’d get. People who think differently, that’s what you want.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:29:23</em></p><p>Why is it that if you look at different models, even released by totally different companies trained on potentially non-overlapping datasets, it’s actually crazy how similar LLMs are to each other?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:29:38</em></p><p>Maybe the datasets are not as non-overlapping as it seems.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:29:41</em></p><p>But there’s some sense in which even if an individual human might be less productive than the future AI, maybe there’s something to the fact that human teams have more diversity than teams of AIs might have. How do we elicit meaningful diversity among AIs? I think just raising the temperature just results in gibberish. You want something more like different scientists have different prejudices or different ideas. How do you get that kind of diversity among AI agents?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:30:06</em></p><p><span>So the reason there has been no diversity, I believe, is because of pre-training. All the pre-trained models are pretty much the same because they pre-train on the same data. Now RL and </span><a href="https://www.interconnects.ai/p/the-state-of-post-training-2025" rel="">post-training</a><span> is where some differentiation starts to emerge because different people come up with different RL training.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:30:26</em></p><p><span>I’ve heard you </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hMHFKgX5uqD4PE59c/an-observation-on-self-play" rel="">hint in the past</a><span> about </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-play" rel="">self-play</a><span> as a way to either get data or match agents to other agents of equivalent intelligence to kick off learning. How should we think about why there are no public proposals of this kind of thing working with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" rel="">LLMs</a><span>?</span></p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:30:49</em></p><p>I would say there are two things to say. The reason why I thought self-play was interesting is because it offered a way to create models using compute only, without data. If you think that data is the ultimate bottleneck, then using compute only is very interesting. So that’s what makes it interesting.</p><p>The thing is that self-play, at least the way it was done in the past—when you have agents which somehow compete with each other—it’s only good for developing a certain set of skills. It is too narrow. It’s only good for negotiation, conflict, certain social skills, strategizing, that kind of stuff. If you care about those skills, then self-play will be useful.</p><p><span>Actually, I think that self-play did find a home, but just in a different form. So things like debate, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13692" rel="">prover-verifier</a><span>, you have some kind of an </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15594" rel="">LLM-as-a-Judge</a><span> which is also incentivized to find mistakes in your work. You could say this is not exactly self-play, but this is a related adversarial setup that people are doing, I believe.</span></p><p>Really self-play is a special case of more general competition between agents. The natural response to competition is to try to be different. So if you were to put multiple agents together and you tell them, “You all need to work on some problem and you are an agent and you’re inspecting what everyone else is working,” they’re going to say, “Well, if they’re already taking this approach, it’s not clear I should pursue it. I should pursue something differentiated.” So I think something like this could also create an incentive for a diversity of approaches.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:32:42</em></p><p>Final question: What is research taste? You’re obviously the person in the world who is considered to have the best taste in doing research in AI. You were the co-author on the biggest things that have happened in the history of deep learning, from AlexNet to GPT-3 to so on. What is it, how do you characterize how you come up with these ideas?</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:33:14</em></p><p>I can comment on this for myself. I think different people do it differently. One thing that guides me personally is an aesthetic of how AI should be, by thinking about how people are, but thinking correctly. It’s very easy to think about how people are incorrectly, but what does it mean to think about people correctly?</p><p><span>I’ll give you some examples. The idea of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron" rel="">artificial neuron</a><span> is directly inspired by the brain, and it’s a great idea. Why? Because you say the brain has all these different organs, it has the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrification" rel="">folds</a><span>, but the folds probably don’t matter. Why do we think that the neurons matter? Because there are many of them. It kind of feels right, so you want the neuron. You want some local learning rule that will change the connections between the neurons. It feels plausible that the brain does it.</span></p><p><span>The idea of the </span><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jlmcc/papers/PDP/Chapter3.pdf" rel="">distributed representation</a><span>. The idea that the brain responds to experience therefore our neural net should learn from experience. The brain learns from experience, the neural net should learn from experience. You kind of ask yourself, is something fundamental or not fundamental? How things should be.</span></p><p>I think that’s been guiding me a fair bit, thinking from multiple angles and looking for almost beauty, beauty and simplicity. Ugliness, there’s no room for ugliness. It’s beauty, simplicity, elegance, correct inspiration from the brain. All of those things need to be present at the same time. The more they are present, the more confident you can be in a top-down belief.</p><p>The top-down belief is the thing that sustains you when the experiments contradict you. Because if you trust the data all the time, well sometimes you can be doing the correct thing but there’s a bug. But you don’t know that there is a bug. How can you tell that there is a bug? How do you know if you should keep debugging or you conclude it’s the wrong direction? It’s the top-down. You can say things have to be this way. Something like this has to work, therefore we’ve got to keep going. That’s the top-down, and it’s based on this multifaceted beauty and inspiration by the brain.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:35:31</em></p><p>Alright, we’ll leave it there.</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:35:33</em></p><p>Thank you so much.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel </strong><em>01:35:34</em></p><p>Ilya, thank you so much.</p><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever </strong><em>01:35:36</em></p><p>Alright.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Several U.S. banking giants and mortgage lenders are reportedly scrambling to assess how much of their customers’ data was stolen during a cyberattack on a New York financial technology company earlier this month.</p>

<p>SitusAMC, which provides technology for over a thousand commercial and real estate financiers, <a href="https://www.situsamc.com/databreach" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed in a statement over the weekend</a> that it had identified a data breach on November 12.</p>







<p>The company said that unspecified hackers had stolen corporate data associated with its banking customers’ relationship with SitusAMC, as well as “accounting records and legal agreements” during the cyberattack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The statement added that the scope and nature of the cyberattack “remains under investigation.” SitusAMC said that the incident is “now contained,” and that its systems are operational. The company said that no encrypting malware was used, suggesting that the hackers were focused on exfiltrating data from the company’s systems rather than causing destruction.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-23/banks-fbi-assessing-hack-of-real-estate-finance-tech-vendor?srnd=phx-technology-cybersecurity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/23/business/situsamc-hack-wall-street-banks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CNN</a>, citing sources, SitusAMC sent data breach notifications to several financial giants, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley. SitusAMC also counts pension funds and state governments as customers, according to its website.</p>

<p>It’s unclear how much data was taken, or how many U.S. banking consumers may be affected by the breach. Companies like SitusAMC may not be widely known outside of the financial world, but provide the mechanisms and technologies for its banking and real estate customers to comply with state and federal rules and regulations. In its role as a middleman for financial clients, the company handles vast amounts of non-public banking information on behalf of its customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to SitusAMC’s website, the company processes billions of documents related to loans annually.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When reached by TechCrunch, Citi spokesperson Patricia Tuma declined to comment on the breach. Tuma would not say if the bank has received any communications from the hackers, such as a demand for money.</p>

<p>Representatives for JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. SitusAMC chief executive Michael Franco also did not respond to our email when contacted for comment Monday.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the FBI told TechCrunch that the bureau is aware of the breach.</p>







<p>“While we are working closely with affected organizations and our partners to understand the extent of potential impact, we have identified no operational impact to banking services,” said FBI director Kash Patel in a statement shared with TechCrunch. “We remain committed to identifying those responsible and safeguarding the security of our critical infrastructure.”</p>

<p>How we achieved 20% faster mobile response times, improved SEO, and reduced infrastructure load.</p>



<p>Until now, when you visited a wiki (like <code>en.wikipedia.org</code>), the server responded in one of two ways: a desktop page, or a redirect to the equivalent mobile URL (like <code>en.m.wikipedia.org</code>). This mobile URL in turn served the mobile version of the page from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a>. Our servers have operated this way since 2011, when we deployed MobileFrontend.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://techblog.wikimedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WMF_Unified_mobile_routing_2025.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://techblog.wikimedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WMF_Unified_mobile_routing_2025.png" alt="Before: Wikimedia CDN responds with a redirect from en.wikipedia.org to en.m.wikipedia.org for requests from mobile clients, and en.m.wikipedia.org then responds with the mobile HTML. After: Wikimedia CDN responds directly with the mobile HTML."></a><figcaption>Diagram of technical change.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Over the past two months we unified the mobile and desktop domain for all wikis (<a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Requests_for_comment/Mobile_domain_sunsetting/2025_Announcement#Timeline">timeline</a>). This means we no longer redirect mobile users to a separate domain while the page is loading.</p>



<p>We completed the change on Wednesday 8 October after deploying to English Wikipedia. The mobile domains became dormant within 24 hours, which confirms that most mobile traffic arrived on Wikipedia via the standard domains and thus experienced a redirect until now.<sup><a href="#footnotes">[1][2]</a></sup></p>



<h2 id="Why?">Why?</h2>



<p>Why did we have a separate mobile domain? And, why did we believe that changing this might benefit us?</p>



<p>The year is 2008 and all sorts of websites large and small have a mobile subdomain. The BBC, IMDb, Facebook, and newspapers around the world all featured the iconic m-dot domain. For Wikipedia, a separate mobile domain made the mobile experiment low-risk to launch and avoided technical limitations. It became the default in 2011 by way of a redirect.</p>



<p>Fast-forward seventeen years, and much has changed. It is no longer common for websites to have m-dot domains. Wikipedia’s use of it is surprising to our present day audience, and it may decrease the perceived strength of domain branding. The technical limitations we had in 2008 have long been solved, with the <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/CDN">Wikimedia CDN</a> having efficient and well-tested support for variable responses under a single URL. And above all, we had reason to believe Google stopped supporting separate mobile domains, which motivated the project to start when it did.</p>



<p>You can find a detailed history and engineering analysis in the <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Requests_for_comment/Mobile_domain_sunsetting">Mobile domain sunsetting RFC</a> along with <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Requests_for_comment/Mobile_domain_sunsetting/status">weekly updates</a> on mediawiki.org.</p>



<h2 id="Site_speed">Site speed</h2>



<p>Google used to link from mobile search results directly to our mobile domain, but last year this stopped. This exposed a huge part of our audience to the mobile redirect and regressed mobile response times by 10-20%.<sup><a href="#footnotes">[2]</a></sup></p>



<p>Google supported mobile domains in 2008 by letting you advertise a separate mobile URL. While Google only indexed the desktop site for content, they stored this mobile URL and linked to it when searching from a mobile device.<sup><a href="#footnotes">[3]</a></sup> This allowed Google referrals to skip over the redirect.</p>



<p>Google introduced a new crawler in 2016, and gradually re-indexed the Internet with it.<sup><a href="#footnotes">[4-7]</a></sup> This new “mobile-first” crawler acts like a mobile device rather than a desktop device, and removes the ability to advertise a separate mobile or desktop link. It’s now one link for everyone! Wikipedia.org was among the last sites Google switched, with May 2024 as the apparent change window.<sup><a href="#footnotes">[2]</a></sup> This meant the 60% of incoming pageviews referred by Google, now had to wait for the same redirect that the other 40% of referrals have experienced since 2011.<sup><a href="#footnotes">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>Unifying our domains eliminated the redirect and led to a <strong>20% improvement in mobile response times</strong>.<sup><a href="#footnotes">[2]</a></sup> This improvement is both a recovery <em>and</em> a net-improvement because it applies to everyone! It recovers the regression that Google-referred traffic started to experience last year, but also improves response times for all other traffic by the same amount.</p>



<p>The graphs below show how the change was felt worldwide. The “Worldwide p50” corresponds to what you might experience in Germany or Italy, with fast connectivity close to our data centers. The “Worldwide p80” resembles what you might experience in Iran browsing the Persian Wikipedia.</p>

<h2 id="SEO">SEO</h2>



<p>The first site affected was not Wikipedia but Commons. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia Commons</a> is the free media repository used by Wikipedia and its sister projects. Tim Starling found in June that only half of the 140 million pages on Commons were known to Google.<sup><a href="#footnotes">[9]</a></sup> And of these known pages, 20 million were also delisted due to the mobile redirect. This had been growing by one million delisted pages every month.<sup><a href="#footnotes">[10]</a></sup> The cause for delisting turned out to be the mobile redirect. You see, the new Google crawler, just like your browser, also has to follow the mobile redirect.</p>



<p>After following the redirect, the crawler reads our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element">page metadata</a> which points back to the standard domain as the preferred one. This creates a loop that can prevent a page from being updated or listed in Google Search. Delisting is not a matter of ranking, but about whether a page is even in the search index.</p>



<p>Tim and myself disabled the mobile redirect for “Googlebot on Commons” through an emergency intervention on June 23rd. Referrals then began to come back, and kept rising for eleven weeks in a row, until reaching a <strong>100% increase in Google-referrals</strong>. From a baseline of 3 million weekly pageviews up to 6 million. Google’s data on clickthroughs shows a similar increase from 1M to 1.8M “clicks”.<sup><a href="#footnotes">[9]</a></sup></p>







<p>We reversed last year’s regression <em>and</em> set a new all-time high. We think there’s three reasons Commons reached new highs:</p>



<ol>
<li>The redirect consumed half of the crawl budget, thus limiting how many pages could be crawled.<sup><a href="#footnotes">[10][11]</a></sup></li>



<li>Google switched Commons to its new crawler some years before Wikipedia.<sup><a href="#footnotes">[12]</a></sup> The index had likely been shrinking for two years already.</li>



<li>Pages on Commons have a sparse link graph. Wikipedia has a rich network of links between articles, whereas pages on Commons represent a photo with an image description that rarely links to other files. This unique page structure makes it hard to discover Commons pages through recursive crawling without a sitemap.</li>
</ol>



<p>Unifying our domains lifted a ceiling we didn’t know was there!</p>



<p>The MediaWiki software has a built-in sitemap generator, but we disabled this on Wikimedia sites over a decade ago.<sup><sup><a href="#footnotes">[13]</a></sup></sup> We decided to enable it for Commons and submitted it to Google on August 6th.<sup><a href="#footnotes">[14][15]</a></sup> Google has since indexed 70 million new pages for Commons, up 140% since June.<sup><sup><a href="#footnotes">[9]</a></sup></sup></p>



<p>We also found that less than 0.1% of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=+&amp;title=Special%3AMediaSearch&amp;type=video&amp;assessment=any-assessment">videos on Commons</a> were recognised by Google as video watch pages (for the Google Search “Videos” tab). I raised this in a partnership meeting with Google Search, and it may’ve been a bug on their end. Commons started showing up in Google Videos a week later.<sup><sup><a href="#footnotes">[16][17]</a></sup></sup></p>



<h2>Link sharing UX</h2>



<p>When sharing links from a mobile device, such link previously hardcoded the mobile domain. Links shared from a mobile device gave you the mobile site, even when received on desktop. The “Desktop” link in the footer of the mobile site pointed to the standard domain and disabled the standard-to-mobile redirect for you, on the assumption you arrived on the mobile site via the redirect. The “Desktop” link did not remember your choice on the mobile domain itself, and there existed no equivalent mobile-to-standard redirect for when you arrive there. This meant a shared mobile link always presented the mobile site, even after opting-out on desktop.</p>



<p>Everyone now shares the same domain which naturally shows the appropiate version.</p>



<p>There is a long tail of stable referrals from news articles, research papers, blogs, talk pages, and mailing lists that refer to the mobile domain. We plan to support this indefinitely. To limit operational complexity, we now serve these through a simple whole-domain redirect. This has the benefit of retroactively fixing the UX issue because <strong>old mobile links now redirect to the standard domain</strong>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnotes">[18]</a></sup></sup></p>



<p>This resolves a long-standing bug with workarounds in the form of shared user scripts,<sup><sup><a href="#footnotes">[19]</a></sup></sup> browser extensions,<sup><sup><a href="#footnotes">[20]</a></sup></sup> and personal scripts.<sup><sup><a href="#footnotes">[24]</a></sup></sup></p>



<h2 id="Infrastructure_load">Infrastructure load</h2>



<p>After publishing an edit, MediaWiki instructs the Wikimedia CDN to clear the cache of affected articles (“purge”). It has been a perennial concern from SRE teams at WMF that our CDN purge rates are unsustainable. For every purge from MediaWiki core, the MobileFrontend extension would add a copy for the mobile domain.</p>

<p>After unifying our domains we turned off these duplicate purges, and cut the MediaWiki purge rate by 50%. Over the past weeks the Wikimedia CDN processed approximately <strong>4 billion fewer purges a day</strong>. MediaWiki used to send purges at a baseline rate of 40K/second with spikes up to 300K/second, and both have been halved. Factoring in other services, the Wikimedia CDN now receives 20% to 40% fewer purges per second overall, depending on the edit activity.<sup><sup><a href="#footnotes">[18]</a></sup></sup></p>

<li>I don’t have a guestimate for when Google switched Commons to its new crawler. I pinpointed May 2024 as the switch date for Wikipedia based on the new redirect impacting page load times (i.e. a non-zero fetch delay). For Commons, this fetch delay was already non-zero since at least 2018. This suggests Google’s old crawler linked mobile users to Commons canonical domain, unlike Wikipedia which it linked to the mobile domain until last year.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Yes, I’m ready to touch the hot stove. Let the language wars begin.</p><p>Actually, the first thing I’ll say is this: Use the tool you’re familiar with. If that’s Python, great, use it. And also, use the best tool for the job. If that’s Python, great, use it. And also, it’s Ok to use a tool for one task just because you’re already using it for all sorts of other tasks and therefore you happen to have it at hand. If you’re hammering nails all day it’s Ok if you’re also using your hammer to open a bottle of beer or scratch your back. Similarly, if you’re programming in Python all day it’s Ok if you’re also using it to fit mixed linear models. If it works for you, great! Keep going. But if you’re struggling, if things seem more difficult than they ought to be, this article series may be for you.</p><p><span>I think people way over-index Python as </span><em>the</em><span> language for data science. It has limitations that I think are quite noteworthy. There are many data-science tasks I’d much rather do in R than in Python.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-178439014" href="https://blog.genesmindsmachines.com/p/python-is-not-a-great-language-for#footnote-1-178439014" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> I believe the reason Python is so widely used in data science is a historical accident, plus it being sort-of Ok at most things, rather than an expression of its inherent suitability for data-science work.</span></p><p><span>At the same time, I think Python is pretty good for deep learning.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-178439014" href="https://blog.genesmindsmachines.com/p/python-is-not-a-great-language-for#footnote-2-178439014" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> There’s a reason PyTorch is the industry standard. When I’m talking about data science here, I’m specifically excluding deep learning. I’m talking about all the other stuff: data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, visualization, statistical modeling, etc. And, as I said in my opening paragraphs, I understand that if you’re already working in Python all day for a good reason (e.g., training AI models) you may also want to do all the rest in Python. I’m doing this myself, in the deep-learning classes I teach. This doesn’t mean I can’t be frustrated by how cumbersome data science often is in the Python world.</span></p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blog.genesmindsmachines.com/p/python-is-not-a-great-language-for?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Thanks for reading Genes, Minds, Machines!

I have been running a research lab in computational biology for over two decades. During this time I have worked with around thirty graduate students and postdocs, all very competent and accomplished computational scientists. The policy in my lab is that everybody is free to use whatever programming language and tools they want to use. I don’t tell people what to do. And more often than not, people choose Python as their programming language of choice.</p><p><span>So here is a typical experience I commonly have with students who use Python. A student comes to my office and shows me some result. I say “This is great, but could you quickly plot the data in this other way?” or “Could you quickly calculate this quantity I just made up and let me know what it looks like when you plot it?” or similar. Usually, the request I make is for something that I know I could do in R in just a few minutes. Examples include converting boxplots into violins or vice versa, turning a line plot into a heatmap, plotting a density estimate instead of a histogram, performing a computation on ranked data values instead of raw data values, and so on. Without fail, from the students that use Python, the response is: “This will take me a bit. Let me sit down at my desk and figure it out and then I’ll be back.” Now let me be absolutely clear: These are strong students. The issue is not that my students don’t know their tools. It very much seems to me to be a problem of the tools themselves. They appear to be sufficiently cumbersome or confusing that requests that I think should be trivial frequently are not.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-178439014" href="https://blog.genesmindsmachines.com/p/python-is-not-a-great-language-for#footnote-3-178439014" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p>No matter the cause of this experience, I have to conclude that there is something fundamentally broken with how data analysis works in Python. It may be a problem with the language itself, or merely a limitation of the available software libraries, or a combination thereof, but whatever it is, its effects are real and I see them routinely. In fact, I have another example, in case you’re tempted to counter, “It’s a skill issue; get better students.” Last fall, I co-taught a class on AI models for biology with an experienced data scientist who does all his work in Python. He knows NumPy and pandas and matplotlib like the back of his hand. In the class, I covered all the theory, and he covered the in-class exercises in Python. So I got to see an expert in Python working through a range of examples. And my reaction to the code examples frequently was, “Why does it have to be so complicated?” So many times, I felt that things that would be just a few lines of simple R code turned out to be quite a bit longer and fairly convoluted. I definitely could not have written that code without extensive studying and completely rewiring my brain in terms of what programming patterns to use. It felt very alien, but not in the form of “wow, this is so alien but also so elegant” but rather “wow, this is so alien and weird and cumbersome.” And again, I don’t think this is because my colleague is not very good at what he’s doing. He is extremely good. The problem appears to be in the fundamental architecture of the tools.</p><p><span>Let me step back for a moment and go over some basic considerations for choosing a language for data science. When I say data science, I mean dissecting and summarizing data, finding patterns, fitting models, and making visualizations. In brief, it’s the kind of stuff scientists and other researchers</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-178439014" href="https://blog.genesmindsmachines.com/p/python-is-not-a-great-language-for#footnote-4-178439014" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> do when they are analyzing their data. This activity is distinct from data engineering or application development, even if the application does a data-heavy workload.</span></p><p>Data science as I define it here involves a lot of interactive exploration of data and quick one-off analyses or experiments. Therefore, any language suitable for data science has to be interpreted, usable in an interactive shell or in a notebook format. This also means performance considerations are secondary. When you want to do a quick linear regression on some data you’re working with, you don’t care whether the task is going to take 50 milliseconds or 500 milliseconds. You care about whether you can open up a shell, type a few lines of code, and get the result in a minute or two, versus having to set up a new project, writing all the boilerplate to make the compiler happy, and then spend more time compiling your code than running it.</p><p><span>If we accept that being able to work interactively and with low startup-cost is a critical feature of a language for data science, we immediately arrive at scripting languages such as Python, or data-science specific languages such as R or Matlab or Mathematica. There’s also Julia, but honestly I don’t know enough about it to write about it coherently. For all I know it’s the best possible data science language out there. But I note that some people </span><a href="https://yuri.is/not-julia/" rel="">who have used it extensively have doubts.</a><span> Either way, I’ll not discuss it further here. I’ll also not consider proprietary languages such as Matlab or Mathematica, or fairly obscure languages lacking a wide ecosystem of useful packages, such as Octave. This leaves us with R and Python as the realistic choices to consider.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-178439014" href="https://blog.genesmindsmachines.com/p/python-is-not-a-great-language-for#footnote-5-178439014" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span></p><p>Before continuing, let me provide a few more thoughts about performance. Performance usually trades off with other features of a language. In simplistic terms, performance comes at the cost of either extra overhead for the programmer (as in Rust) or increased risk of obscure bugs (as in C) or both. For data science applications, I consider a high risk of obscure bugs or incorrect results as not acceptable, and I also think convenience for the programmer is more important than raw performance. Computers are fast and thinking hurts. I’d rather spend less mental energy on telling the computer what to do and wait a little longer for the results. So the easier a language makes my job for me, the better. If I am really performance-limited in some analysis, I can always rewrite that particular part of the analysis in Rust, once I know exactly what I’m doing and what computations I need.</p><p><span>A critical component of not making my job harder than it needs to be is separating the logic of the analysis from the logistics. What I mean by this is I want to be able to specify at a conceptual level how the data should be analyzed and what the outcome of the computation should be, and I don’t want to have to think about the logistics of how the computation is performed. As a general rule, if I have to think about data types, numerical indices, or loops, or if I have to manually disassemble and reassemble datasets, chances are I’m bogged down in logistics.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-178439014" href="https://blog.genesmindsmachines.com/p/python-is-not-a-great-language-for#footnote-6-178439014" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span></p><p><span>To provide a concrete example, consider the dataset of </span><a href="https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/" rel="">penguins from the Palmer Archipelago.</a><span> There are three different penguin species in the dataset, and the penguins live on three different islands. Assume I want to calculate the mean and standard deviation of penguin weight for every combination of penguin species and island, excluding any cases where the body weight of a penguin is not known. An ideal data science language would allow me to express this computation in these terms, and it would require approximately as much code as it took me to write this sentence in the English language. And indeed this is possible, both in R and in Python.</span></p><p>Here is the relevant code in R, using the tidyverse approach:</p><pre><code>library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins |&gt;
  filter(!is.na(body_mass_g)) |&gt;
  group_by(species, island) |&gt;
  summarize(
    body_weight_mean = mean(body_mass_g),
    body_weight_sd = sd(body_mass_g)
  )</code></pre><p>And here is the equivalent code in Python, using the pandas package:</p><pre><code>import pandas as pd
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins

penguins = load_penguins()

(penguins
 .dropna(subset=['body_mass_g'])
 .groupby(['species', 'island'])
 .agg(
     body_weight_mean=('body_mass_g', 'mean'),
     body_weight_sd=('body_mass_g', 'std')
 )
 .reset_index()
)</code></pre><p>These two examples are quite similar. At this level of complexity of the analysis, Python does fine. I would consider the R code to be slightly easier to read (notice how many quotes and brackets the Python code needs), but the differences are minor. In both cases, we take the penguins dataset, remove the penguins for which body weight is missing, then specify that we want to perform the computation separately on every combination of penguin species and island, and then calculate the means and standard deviations.</p><p>Contrast this with equivalent code that is full of logistics, where I’m using only basic Python language features and no special data wrangling package:</p><pre><code>from palmerpenguins import load_penguins
import math

penguins = load_penguins()

# Convert DataFrame to list of dictionaries
penguins_list = penguins.to_dict('records')

# Filter out rows where body_mass_g is missing
filtered = [row for row in penguins_list if not math.isnan(row['body_mass_g'])]

# Group by species and island
groups = {}
for row in filtered:
    key = (row['species'], row['island'])
    if key not in groups:
        groups[key] = []
    groups[key].append(row['body_mass_g'])

# Calculate mean and standard deviation for each group
results = []
for (species, island), values in groups.items():
    n = len(values)
    
    # Calculate mean
    mean = sum(values) / n
    
    # Calculate standard deviation
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in values) / (n - 1)
    std_dev = math.sqrt(variance)
    
    results.append({
        'species': species,
        'island': island,
        'body_weight_mean': mean,
        'body_weight_sd': std_dev
    })

# Sort results to match order used by pandas
results.sort(key=lambda x: (x['species'], x['island']))

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(f"{result['species']:10} {result['island']:10} "
          f"Mean: {result['body_weight_mean']:7.2f} g, "
          f"SD: {result['body_weight_sd']:6.2f} g")</code></pre><p><span>This code is much longer, it contains numerous loops, and it explicitly pulls the dataset apart and then puts it back together again. Regardless of language choice, I hope you can see that the version without logistics is superior to the version that gets bogged down in logistical details.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-178439014" href="https://blog.genesmindsmachines.com/p/python-is-not-a-great-language-for#footnote-7-178439014" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span></p><p>I will end things here for now. This post is long enough. In future installments, I’ll go over specific issues that make data analysis more complicated in Python than in R. In brief, I believe there are several reasons why Python code often devolves into dealing with data logistics. As much as the programmer may try to avoid logistics and stick to high-level conceptual programming patterns, either the language itself or the available libraries get in the way and tend to thwart those efforts. I will go into details soon.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            <p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-25/1764079669-552357-1.png" alt="Kagi search interface displayed on the Orion Browser on laptop, tablet, and smartphone"></p>

<p>After six years of relentless development, <strong>Orion for MacOS 1.0 is here</strong>.</p>

<p>What started as a vision initiated by our founder, Vladimir Prelovac, has now come to fruition on Mac, iPhone, and iPad. Today, Orion for macOS officially leaves its beta phase behind and joins our iOS and iPadOS apps as a fully‑fledged, production‑ready browser.</p>

<p>While doing so, it expands Kagi ecosystem of privacy-respecting, user-centric products (that we have begun fondly naming “Kagiverse”) to now include: <a href="https://kagi.com/">Search</a>, <a href="https://kagi.com/assistant">Assistant</a>, <a href="https://orionbrowser.com/">Browser</a>, <a href="https://translate.kagi.com/">Translate</a>, <a href="https://news.kagi.com/">News</a> with more to come.</p>

<p>We built Orion for people who feel that modern browsing has drifted too far from serving the user. This is our invitation to <strong>browse beyond ✴︎ the status quo</strong>.</p>

<h2>Why a new browser?</h2>

<p>The obvious question is: <strong>why <em>the heck</em> do we need a new browser?</strong> The world already has Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, and a growing list of “AI browsers.” Why add yet another?</p>

<p>Because something fundamental has been lost.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Zero telemetry, privacy‑first access to the internet: a basic human right.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your browser is the most intimate tool you have on your computer. It sees everything you read, everything you search, everything you type. Do you want that relationship funded by advertisers, or by you?</p>

<p>With ad‑funded browsers and AI overlays, your activity is a gold mine. Every click becomes a way to track, every page another opportunity to profile you a little more deeply. We believe there needs to be a different path: <strong>a browser that answers only to its user.</strong></p>

<p>Orion is our attempt at that browser. No trade-offs between features and privacy. It’s fast, customizable, and uncompromising on both fronts.</p>

<h2>A bold technical choice: WebKit, not another Chromium clone</h2>

<p>In a world dominated by Chromium, choosing a rendering engine is an act of resistance.</p>

<p>From day one, we made the deliberate choice to build Orion on <a href="https://webkit.org/"><strong>WebKit</strong></a>, the open‑source engine at the heart of Safari and the broader Apple ecosystem. It gives us:</p>

<ul>
<li>A high‑performance engine that is <strong>deeply optimized for macOS and iOS</strong>.</li>
<li>An alternative to the growing Chromium monoculture.</li>
<li>A foundation that is not controlled by an advertising giant.</li>
</ul>

<p>Orion may feel familiar if you’re used to Safari – respecting your muscle memory and the aesthetics of macOS and iOS – but it is an entirely different beast under the hood. We combined native WebKit speed with a completely new approach to extensions, privacy, and customization.</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-25/1764079784-790203-orion-safari.png" alt="Orion and Safari browser windows displaying extension management interfaces with popular extensions listed"></p>

<h2>Speed by nature, privacy by default</h2>

<p>Most people switch browsers for one reason: <strong>speed</strong>.</p>

<p>Orion is designed to be fast by nature, not just in benchmarks, but in how it feels every day:</p>

<ul>
<li>A lean, native codebase without ad‑tech bloat.</li>
<li>Optimized startup, tab switching, and page rendering.</li>
<li>A UI that gets out of your way and gives you more screen real estate for content.</li>
</ul>

<p>Alongside speed, we treat privacy as a first‑class feature:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Zero Telemetry</strong>: We don’t collect usage data. No analytics, no identifiers, no tracking.</li>
<li><strong>No ad or tracking technology</strong> baked in: Orion is not funded by ads, so there is no incentive to follow you around the web.</li>
<li><strong>Built‑in protections</strong>: Strong content blocking and privacy defaults from the first launch.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Speed. Extensions. Privacy. Pick all three.</h2>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-25/1764079906-671487-settings.png" alt="Orion browser Privacy settings panel showing tracker removal, history deletion, cookie management, crash report options, and content blocker configuration."></p>

<h2>Thoughtful AI, security first</h2>

<p>We are excited about what AI can do for search, browsing, and productivity. Kagi, the company behind Orion, has been experimenting with AI‑powered tools for years while staying true to our <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/why-kagi/ai-philosophy.html">AI integration philosophy</a>.</p>

<p>But we are also watching a worrying trend: AI agents are being rushed directly into the browser core, with deep access to everything you do online – and sometimes even to your local machine.</p>

<p>Security researchers have already documented serious issues in early AI browsers and “agentic” browser features:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://labs.sqrx.com/comet-mcp-api-allows-ai-browsers-to-execute-local-commands-dec185fb524b">Hidden or undocumented APIs</a> that allowed embedded AI components to execute arbitrary local commands on users’ devices.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@mdmeeng01/perplexitys-comet-got-hijacked-by-hidden-prompts-and-it-changed-how-i-think-about-ai-browsers-fb22b673ece9">Prompt‑injection attacks</a> that trick AI agents into ignoring safety rules, visiting malicious sites, or leaking sensitive information beyond what traditional browser sandboxes were designed to protect.</li>
<li>Broader concerns that some implementations are effectively “<a href="https://medium.com/utopian/perplexity-was-supposed-to-change-search-instead-its-lighting-everything-on-fire-922379e72083">lighting everything on fire</a>” by expanding the browser’s attack surface and data flows in ways users don’t fully understand.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our stance is simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>We are not against AI, and we are conscious of <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/llms">its limitations</a>. We already integrate with AI‑powered services wherever it makes functional sense and will continue to expand those capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>We are against rushing insecure, always‑on agents into the browser core.</strong> Your browser should be a secure gateway, not an unvetted co‑pilot wired into everything you do.</li>
</ul>

<p>So today:</p>

<ul>
<li>Orion ships with <strong>no built‑in AI code</strong> in its core.</li>
<li>We focus on providing a clean, predictable environment, <strong>especially for enterprises and privacy‑conscious professionals</strong>.</li>
<li>Orion is designed to connect seamlessly to the AI tools you choose – soon including Kagi’s intelligent features – while keeping a clear separation between your browser and any external AI agents.</li>
</ul>

<p>As AI matures and security models improve, we’ll continue to evaluate thoughtful, user‑controlled ways to bring AI into your workflow without compromising safety, privacy or user choice.</p>

<h2>Simple for everyone, limitless for experts</h2>

<p>We designed Orion to bridge the gap between simplicity and power. Out of the box, it’s a clean, intuitive browser for anyone. Under the hood, it’s a deep toolbox for people who live in their browser all day.</p>

<p>Some of the unique features you’ll find in Orion 1.0:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Focus Mode</strong>: Instantly transform any website into a distraction‑free web app. Perfect for documentation, writing, or web apps you run all day.
<img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-25/1764079998-879831-focusmode.gif" alt="Browser window showing Focus Mode being activated, simplifying webpage content by removing distractions."></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Link Preview</strong>: Peek at content from any app – email, notes, chat – without fully committing to opening a tab, keeping your workspace tidy.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Mini Toolbar, Overflow Menu, and Page Tweak</strong>: Fine‑tune each page’s appearance and controls, so the web adapts to you, not the other way around.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Profiles as Apps</strong>: Isolate your work, personal, and hobby browsing into completely separate profiles, each with its own extensions, cookies, and settings.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-25/1764080084-770819-profiles.png" alt="Orion browser Profiles management screen showing Primary, Incognito, and Business profiles with sidebar navigation menu."></p>

<p>For power users, we’ve added granular options throughout the browser. These are there when you want them, and out of your way when you don’t.</p>

<p>Orion 1.0 also reflects six years of <a href="https://orionfeedback.org/">feedback</a> from early adopters. Many invisible improvements – tab stability, memory behavior, complex web app compatibility – are a direct result of people pushing Orion hard in their daily workflows and telling us what broke.</p>

<h2>Browse Beyond ✴︎: our new signature</h2>

<p>With this release, we are introducing our new signature: <strong>Browse Beyond ✴︎</strong>.</p>

<p>We originally started with the browser name ‘Kagi.’ On February 3, 2020, Vlad suggested a shortlist for rebranding: Comet, Core, Blaze, and Orion. We chose Orion not just for the name itself, but because it perfectly captured our drive for exploration and curiosity. It was a natural fit that set the stage for everything that followed.</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-25/1764080256-734784-orionlogo-search.png" alt="Evolution of logo designs from water droplet through rocket, astronaut, infinity symbol, lighthouse, robot, to final cosmic sphere design."></p>

<p>You’ll see this reflected in our refreshed visual identity:</p>

<ul>
<li>A star (✴︎) motif throughout our communication.</li>
<li>A refined logo that now uses <strong>the same typeface as Kagi</strong>, creating a clear visual bond between our browser and our search engine.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-25/1764080330-747115-kagi-orion.png" alt="Kagi logo on orange background next to Orion browser logo with star icon and “Browse Beyond” tagline on purple background."></p>

<p>Orion is part of the broader <strong>Kagi ecosystem</strong>, united by a simple idea: the internet should be built for people, not advertisers or any other third parties.</p>

<h2>Small team, sustainable model</h2>

<p>Orion is built by a team of just six developers.</p>

<p>To put that in perspective:</p>

<ul>
<li>That’s roughly 10% of the size of the “small” browser teams at larger companies.</li>
<li>And a rounding error compared to the teams behind Chrome or Edge.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet, the impact is real: over <strong>1 million downloads to date</strong>, and a dedicated community of <a href="https://kagi.com/stats?stat=orion">2480</a> paid subscribers who make this independence possible.</p>

<p>For the first two years, development was carried out by a single developer. Today, we are a tight knit group operating close to our users. We listen, debate, and implement fixes proposed directly by our community on <a href="https://orionfeedback.org/">OrionFeedback.org</a>.</p>

<p>This is our only source of decision making, rather than any usage analytics or patterns, because remember, Orion is zero-telemetry!</p>

<p>This small team approach lets us move quickly, stay focused, and avoid the bloat or hype that often comes with scale.</p>

<h2>Free, yet self‑funded</h2>

<p><strong>Orion is free for everyone.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Every user also receives 200 free Kagi searches</strong>, with no account or sign‑up required. It’s our way of introducing you to fast, ad‑free, privacy‑respecting search from day one.</p>

<p>But we are also 100% self‑funded. We don’t sell your data and we don’t take money from advertisers, which means we rely directly on our users to sustain the project.</p>

<p>There are three ways to <a href="https://kagi.com/onboarding?p=orion_plan">contribute to Orion’s future</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tip Jar (from the app): A simple way to say “thank you” without any commitment.</li>
<li>Supporter Subscription: $5/month or $50/year.</li>
<li>Lifetime Access: A one‑time payment of $150 for life.</li>
</ul>

<p>Supporters (via subscription or lifetime purchase) unlock a set of <strong>Orion+</strong> perks available today, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Floating windows: Keep a video or window on top of other apps.</li>
<li>Customization: Programmable buttons and custom application icons.</li>
<li>Early access to new, supporter‑exclusive features we’re already building for next year.</li>
</ul>

<p>By supporting Orion, you’re not just funding a browser – you are co‑funding a better web with humans at the center.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p><strong>I</strong>.</p><p>On Friday, the Hard Fork team published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">our interview</a> with Roblox CEO David Baszucki. In the days since, it has become the most-discussed interview we've done in three years on the show. Listeners who wrote in to us said they were shocked to hear the leader of a platform with 151.5 million monthly users, most of them minors, express frustration and annoyance at being asked about the company's history of failures related to child safety. Journalists described the interview as "<a href="https://news.google.com/read/CBMidkFVX3lxTE4xNlk2SVc0YWJhRXF1Z2NUa1RJZFhRYzhCclk3Z2d2VFVkY2JsQUVIa1A4QUJJSGlFcnIwYjFNZ2hEV3JaMG4ycWxvX2YyMlpJeEVOaGhDLWZyamRGWS03MFEwalB0cDRtLU5uM3FFRnNaUjRpS2c?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US%3Aen&amp;ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">bizarre</a>," "<a href="https://news.google.com/read/CBMi4wFBVV95cUxOTUlxUlVyeFhrRk9XSDd1enBzcmVnbm9uVFVoOGlnUUdLcE9VT291SndCT0RVUlY2ZmJMOFh5bG9lZ2VpVDQ3WkFhMTFXcTJTaUhxTjd2b2NrT0lFeWlLeUxiUEd3Sk1yeEgwYTlTcG1PdnAtNnlBNHdYV1lEejYtODU5RlZUa1Z6VzJrcnFXeGtTbGpQR2hIRXRqcWZzMGhpTzRnVlNsaERmcmxBZWcwdEtJejRfVkhQYUdTQmZNUl9PdEVKUUZkVHBfT3RXUFRUMURIc0ZiZ20zLVY4Z3ZfNENKaw?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US%3Aen&amp;ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">unhinged</a>," and a "<a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-new-york-times-interview-baszucki-2000646174?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">car crash</a>." </p><p>And a case can be made that it was all of those things — even if Baszucki, in the studio afterwards and <a href="https://x.com/DavidBaszucki/status/1991944434330800427?s=20&amp;ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">later on X</a>, insisted to us that he had had a good time. In the moment, though, Baszucki's dismissive attitude toward discussing child safety struck me as something worse: familiar.</p><p>Baszucki, after all, is not the first CEO to have insisted to me that a platform's problems are smaller than I am making them out to be. Nor is he the first to blame the platform's enormous scale, or to try to change the subject. (He is the first tech CEO to suggest to me that maybe there should be prediction markets in video games for children, but that's another story.)</p><p>What people found noteworthy about our interview, I think, was the fresh evidence that our most successful tech CEOs really do think and talk this way. Given a chance to display empathy for the victims of crimes his platform enabled, or to convey regret about historical safety lapses, or even just to gesture at some sense of responsibility for the hundreds of millions of children who in various ways are depending on him, the CEO throws up his hands and asks: how long are you guys going to be going on about all this stuff? </p><p>Roblox is different from other social products in that it explicitly courts users as young as 5. (You are supposed to be at least 13 to use Instagram, TikTok, and other major platforms.) That has always put significant pressure on the company to develop serious safety features. The company <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/tr/newsroom/2024/07/driving-civility-and-safety-for-all-users?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">says</a> it spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year on safety, and that 10 percent of its employees work on trust and safety issues. And trust and safety workers I know tell me that they respect Roblox's safety teams.</p><p>At the same time, this is a platform launched in 2006 where, for most of its history, adults could freely approach and message any minor unless their parents had dug into the app settings. Roblox did not verify users' ages, letting any child identify as 13 or older to bypass content restrictions. Filters intended to prevent inappropriate chat or the exchange of personal information were easily bypassed by slightly changing the spelling of words. Parental controls could be circumvented simply by a child creating a new account and declaring that they were at least 13.</p><p>Last year the company introduced new restrictions on chat. And this year, the company said it would deploy <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">its own age estimation technology</a> to determine users' ages and restrict the content available to them accordingly. This rollout was the main reason we had sought to interview Baszucki in the first place — something we had communicated to his team.</p><p>Which only made it stranger when Baszucki expressed surprise at our line of inquiry and threw his PR team under the bus. ("If our PR people said, “Let’s talk about age-gating for an hour,' I’m up for it, but I love your pod. I thought I came here to talk about everything,'" he said.)</p><p>Since 2018, at least two dozen people in the United States have been arrested and accused of abducting or abusing victims they met on Roblox, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">according to a 2024 investigation by Bloomberg</a>. Attorneys general in Texas, Kentucky, and Louisiana have filed lawsuits against Roblox alleging that the platform facilitates child exploitation and grooming. More than 35 families have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-rules-online-platform-roblox-keeping-alleged-abuse/story?id=127190227&amp;ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">filed lawsuits</a> against the company over child predation.</p><p>As recently as this month, a reporter for the <em>Guardian</em> created an account presenting herself as a child and found that in Roblox <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/05/roblox-game-robux-children-child-kids-safety-parental-controls?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="noreferrer">she could wander user-created strip clubs</a>, casinos, and horror games. In one "hangout" game, in which she identified as a 13-year-old, another avatar sexually assaulted her by thrusting his hips into her avatar's face as she begged him to leave her alone.</p><p>It's true that any platform that lets strangers communicate will lead to real-world harm. I believe that millions of children use Roblox daily without incident. And we would not want to shut down the entire internet to prevent a single bad thing from ever happening. </p><p>But there is much a leader can do with the knowledge that his platform will inevitably lead to harm, should he wish. </p><p>Understanding how attractive Roblox would be to predators, the company long ago could have blocked unrestricted contact between adults and minors. It could have adopted age verification before a wave of state legislation signaled that it would soon become mandatory anyway. It could have made it harder for children under 13 to create new accounts, and require them to get parental consent in a way it could verify.</p><p>But doing so would require Roblox to focus on outcomes for children, at the likely expense of growth. And so here we are.</p><p><strong>II</strong>.</p><p>Galling? Yes. But like I said: it's also familiar. </p><p>Over and over again, we have seen leaders in Baszucki's position choose growth over guardrails. Safety features come out years after the need for them is identified, if at all. Internal critics are sidelined, laid off, or managed out. And when journalists ask, politely but insistently, why so many of their users are suffering, executives laugh and tell us that we're the crazy ones.</p><p>Look at OpenAI, where the company is reckoning with the fact that making its models less sycophantic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/23/technology/openai-chatgpt-users-risks.html?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">has been worse for user engagement</a> — and is building new features to turn the engagement dial back up.</p><p>Look at TikTok, which has answered concerns that short-form video is <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11588245/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="noreferrer">worsening academic performance for children</a> with new "digital well-being features" that include an affirmation journal, a "background sound generator aimed at improving the mental health of its users," and "new badges to reward people who use the platform within limits, especially teens." Answering concerns that teens are using the app too much with more reasons to use the app.</p><p>Or look at Meta, where new court filings from over the weekend allege ... <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/meta-buried-causal-evidence-social-media-harm-us-court-filings-allege-2025-11-23/?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">a truly staggering number of things</a>. To name a few: the company "stalled internal efforts to prevent child predators from contacting minors for years due to growth concerns," according to Jeff Horwitz in Reuters; "recognized that optimizing its products to increase teen engagement resulted in serving them more harmful content, but did so anyway"; and gave users 17 attempts to traffic people for sex before banning their accounts. (Meta denies the allegations, which are drawn from internal documents that have not been made public; Meta has also objected to unsealing the documents.) </p><p>Lawsuits will always contain the most salacious allegations lawyers can find, of course. But what struck me about these latest filings is not the lawyers' predictably self-serving framing but rather the quotes from Meta's own employees.</p><p>When the company declined to publish internal research from 2019 which showed that no longer looking at Facebook and Instagram improved users' mental health, one employee said: "If the results are bad and we don’t publish and they leak ... is it going to look like tobacco companies doing research and knowing cigs were bad and then keeping that info to themselves?”</p><p>When Meta researchers found that by 2018, approximately 40 percent of children ages 9 to 12 were daily Instagram users — despite the fact that you are supposed to be 13 to join — some employees bristled at what they perceived as tacit encouragement from executives to accelerate growth efforts among children. </p><p>"Oh good, we’re going after &lt;13 year olds now?” one wrote, as cited in <a href="https://time.com/7336204/meta-lawsuit-files-child-safety/?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer"><em>Time</em>'s account of the brief</a>. “Zuck has been talking about that for a while...targeting 11 year olds feels like tobacco companies a couple decades ago (and today). Like we’re seriously saying ‘we have to hook them young’ here.” </p><p>When Meta studied the potential of its products to be addictive in 2018, it found that 55 percent of 20,000 surveyed users showed at least some signs of "problematic use." When it published that research the following year, though, it redefined "problematic use" to include only the most severe cases — 3.1 percent of users.</p><p>&nbsp;“Because our product exploits weaknesses in the human psychology to promote product engagement and time spent,” a user experience researcher wrote, the company should “alert people to the effect that the product has on their brain.”</p><p>You will not be surprised to learn that the company did not alert people to the issue.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>As usual, the rank-and-file employees are doing their job. Over and over again, though, their boss' boss tells them to stop.</p><p>The thing is, platforms' strategy of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">delay, deny and deflect</a> mostly works. </p><p>Americans have short attention spans — and lots to worry about. The tech backlash that kicked off in 2017 inspired platforms to make meaningful and effective investments in content moderation, cybersecurity, platform integrity, and other teams that worked to protect their user bases. Imperfect as these efforts were, they bolstered my sense that tech platforms were susceptible to pressure from the public, from lawmakers and from journalists. They acted slowly, and incompletely, but at least they acted.</p><p>Fast forward to today and the bargain no longer holds. Platforms do whatever the president of the United States tells them to do, and very little else. Shame, that once-great regulator of social norms and executive behavior, has all but disappeared from public life. In its place is denial, defiance, and the noxious vice signaling of the investor class.</p><p>I'm still reckoning with what it means to do journalism in a world where the truth can barely hold anyone's attention — much less hold a platform accountable, in any real sense of that word. I'm rethinking how to cover tech policy at a time when it is being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/technology/meta-mark-zuckerberg-trump.html?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">made by whim</a>. I'm noticing the degree to which platforms wish to be judged only by their stated intentions, and almost never on the outcomes of anyone who uses them. </p><p>In the meantime the platforms hurtle onward, pitching ever-more fantastical visions of the future while seeming barely interested in stewarding the present.</p><p>For the moment, I'm grateful that a car-crash interview drew attention to one CEO's exasperation with being asked about that. But the real problem isn't that David Baszucki talks this way. It's that so many of his peers do, too.</p><figure><img src="https://www.platformer.news/content/images/2024/05/floating_linebreak_600px-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="600" height="157" srcset="https://www.platformer.news/content/images/2024/05/floating_linebreak_600px-1.png 600w"></figure><p><strong>Sponsored</strong></p><h3 id="unknown-number-calling-it%E2%80%99s-not-random%E2%80%A6">Unknown number calling?

In this case, though, the revived moratorium had little support outside the David Sacks wing of the party. And so — for now, anyway — it fell apart. </p><p><strong>What people are saying: </strong>State lawmakers are fighting the moratorium proposal Trump made to Congress. Today, a letter <a href="https://ari.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NDAA-State-Policymaker-Coalition-Letter-11-23-25-Oppose-AI-Preemption.pdf?ref=platformer.news"><u>signed</u></a> by 280 state lawmakers urged Congress to “reject any provision that overrides state and local AI legislation.”</p><p>A moratorium would threaten existing laws that “strengthen consumer transparency, guide responsible government procurement, protect patients, and support artists and creators,” the letter said.</p><p>On the other side of the debate, the tech-funded industry PAC Leading the Future <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/24/ai-pac-trump-congress-midterms.html?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">announced a $10 million campaign</a> to push Congress to pass national AI regulations that would supersede state law.  </p><p><em>—Ella Markianos</em></p><hr><h3 id="x%E2%80%99s-about-this-account-meltdown">X’s "About This Account" meltdown</h3><p><strong>What happened: </strong>On Friday, <strong>X</strong> debuted its <strong>About This Account</strong> feature globally in a rollout that descended into chaos over the feature’s accidental uncovering of foreign actors behind popular right-wing accounts that actively share news on US politics.&nbsp;</p><p>X users can now see the date an account joined the platform, how many times it has changed its username, and most importantly, the country or region it’s based in. The move, <a href="https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1992335925322613127?ref=platformer.news"><u>according to</u></a> X head of product <strong>Nikita Bier</strong>, “is an important first step to securing the integrity of the global town square.”</p><p>But the feature has had an unintended consequence: it revealed that big pro-Trump accounts like <strong>@MAGANationX</strong>, a right-wing user with nearly 400,000 followers that regularly shares news about US politics, aren't actually based in the US. MAGANationX, for example, is based in <strong>Eastern Europe</strong>, according to X.&nbsp;</p><p>Other popular right-wing accounts — that use names from the Trump family — like <strong>@IvankaNews_ </strong>(1 million followers before it was suspended), <strong>@BarronTNews</strong> (nearly 600,000 followers), and <strong>@TrumpKaiNews</strong> (more than 11,000 followers), appear to be based in <strong>Nigeria</strong>, Eastern Europe, and <strong>Macedonia</strong> respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>The data could be skewed by travel, VPNs, or old IP addresses, and some have complained their location is inaccurate. Bier said the rollout has “a few rough edges” that will be resolved by Tuesday.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why we’re following: </strong>One of <strong>Elon Musk</strong>’s promises during the takeover of Twitter was to purge the platform of inauthentic accounts. But several studies <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/x-new-location-transparency-feature-questions-origins-maga-accounts-rcna245487?ref=platformer.news"><u>have shown</u></a> that suspected inauthentic activity has remained at about the same levels. X has long struggled with troll farms spreading misinformation, boosted by its tendency to monetarily reward engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>There's also an irony in the fact that revealing the origins of ragebait-posting political accounts like these was once the subject of groundbreaking research by the Stanford Internet Observatory and other academic researchers. But the effort outraged Republicans, which then <a href="https://www.platformer.news/stanford-internet-observatory-shutdown-stamos-diresta-sio/" rel="noreferrer">sued them over their contacts with the government about information operations like these</a> and largely succeeded in stopping the work. </p><p><strong>What people are saying: </strong>Accusations of foreign actors spreading fake news flew on both sides of the aisle.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FLUX.2 is designed for real-world creative workflows, not just demos or party tricks. It generates high-quality images while maintaining character and style consistency across multiple reference images, following structured prompts, reading and writing complex text, adhering to brand guidelines, and reliably handling lighting, layouts, and logos. FLUX.2 can edit images at up to 4 megapixels while preserving detail and coherence.</p><h2><strong>Black Forest Labs: Open Core</strong></h2><p>We believe visual intelligence should be shaped by researchers, creatives, and developers everywhere, not just a few. That’s why we pair frontier capability with open research and open innovation, releasing powerful, inspectable, and composable open-weight models for the community, alongside robust, production-ready endpoints for teams that need scale, reliability, and customization.</p><p>When we launched Black Forest Labs in 2024, we set out to make open innovation sustainable, building on our experience developing some of the world’s most popular open models. We’ve combined open models like FLUX.1 [dev]—<a target="_blank" rel="noindex nofollow" href="https://huggingface.co/models?sort=likes">the most popular open image model globally</a>—with professional-grade models like FLUX.1 Kontext [pro], which powers teams from Adobe to Meta and beyond. Our open core approach drives experimentation, invites scrutiny, lowers costs, and ensures that we can keep sharing open technology from the Black Forest and the Bay into the world.</p><h2><strong>From FLUX.1 to FLUX.2</strong></h2><p>Precision, efficiency, control, extreme realism - where FLUX.1 showed the potential of media models as powerful creative tools, FLUX.2 shows how frontier capability can transform production workflows. By radically changing the economics of generation, FLUX.2 will become an indispensable part of our creative infrastructure.</p><p><img alt="" draggable="false" loading="lazy" width="1578" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://bfl.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2F2gpum2i6%2Fproduction%2F3d8b43142639897e0f0e4a5c073ad7202c2c2fea-1578x800.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://bfl.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2F2gpum2i6%2Fproduction%2F3d8b43142639897e0f0e4a5c073ad7202c2c2fea-1578x800.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://bfl.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2F2gpum2i6%2Fproduction%2F3d8b43142639897e0f0e4a5c073ad7202c2c2fea-1578x800.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p><em><strong>Output Versatility</strong>: FLUX.2 is capable of generating highly detailed, photoreal images along with infographics with complex typography, all at resolutions up to 4MP</em></p><h2><strong>What’s New</strong></h2><ul><li><span><strong>Multi-Reference Support</strong>: Reference up to 10 images simultaneously with the best character / product / style consistency available today.</span></li><li><span><strong>Image Detail &amp; Photorealism</strong>: Greater detail, sharper textures, and more stable lighting suitable for product shots, visualization, and photography-like use cases.</span></li><li><span><strong>Text Rendering</strong>: Complex typography, infographics, memes and UI mockups with legible fine text now work reliably in production.</span></li><li><span><strong>Enhanced Prompt Following</strong>: Improved adherence to complex, structured instructions, including multi-part prompts and compositional constraints.</span></li><li><span><strong>World Knowledge</strong>: Significantly more grounded in real-world knowledge, lighting, and spatial logic, resulting in more coherent scenes with expected behavior.</span></li><li><span><strong>Higher Resolution &amp; Flexible Input/Output Ratios:</strong> Image editing on resolutions up to 4MP.</span></li></ul><p><img alt="" draggable="false" loading="lazy" width="3721" height="2798" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://bfl.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2F2gpum2i6%2Fproduction%2F6844c7ed531e3aa09958eea8a9deae8bdabd0b54-3721x2798.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://bfl.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2F2gpum2i6%2Fproduction%2F6844c7ed531e3aa09958eea8a9deae8bdabd0b54-3721x2798.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p><em>All variants of FLUX.2 offer image editing from text and multiple references in one model.</em></p><h2><strong>Available Now</strong></h2><p>The FLUX.2 family covers a spectrum of model products, from fully managed, production-ready APIs to open-weight checkpoints developers can run themselves.

The model couples the <a target="_blank" rel="noindex nofollow" href="https://docs.mistral.ai/models/mistral-small-3-2-25-06">Mistral-3 24B parameter vision-language model </a>with a rectified flow transformer. The VLM brings real world knowledge and contextual understanding, while the transformer captures spatial relationships, material properties, and compositional logic that earlier architectures could not render.</p><p>FLUX.2 now provides multi-reference support, with the ability to combine up to 10 images into a novel output, an output resolution of up to 4MP, substantially better prompt adherence and world knowledge, and significantly improved typography. We re-trained the model’s latent space from scratch to achieve better learnability and higher image quality at the same time, a step towards solving the “Learnability-Quality-Compression” trilemma.

So, we started Danswer, an open-source enterprise search project built to be self-hosted and easily customized.</p><p>As the project grew, we started seeing an interesting trend—even though we were explicitly a search app, people wanted to use Danswer just to chat with LLMs. We’d hear, “the connectors, indexing, and search are great, but I’m going to start by connecting GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Qwen to provide my team with a secure way to use them”.</p><p>Many users would add RAG, agents, and custom tools later, but much of the usage stayed ‘basic chat’. We thought: “why would people co-opt an enterprise search when other AI chat solutions exist?”</p><p>As we continued talking to users, we realized two key points:</p><p>(1) just giving a company secure access to an LLM with a great UI and simple tools is a huge part of the value add of AI</p><p>(2) providing this <i>well</i> is much harder than you might think and the bar is incredibly high</p><p>Consumer products like ChatGPT and Claude already provide a great experience—and chat with AI for work is something (ideally) everyone at the company uses 10+ times per day. People expect the same snappy, simple, and intuitive UX with a full feature set. Getting hundreds of small details right to take the experience from “this works” to “this feels magical” is not easy, and nothing else in the space has managed to do it.</p><p>So ~3 months ago we pivoted to Onyx, the open-source chat UI with:</p><p>- (truly) world class chat UX. Usable both by a fresh college grad who grew up with AI and an industry veteran who’s using AI tools for the first time.</p><p>- Support for all the common add-ons: RAG, connectors, web search, custom tools, MCP, assistants, deep research.</p><p>- RBAC, SSO, permission syncing, easy on-prem hosting to make it work for larger enterprises.</p><p>Through building features like deep research and code interpreter that work across model providers, we've learned a ton of non-obvious things about engineering LLMs that have been key to making Onyx work. I'd like to share two that were particularly interesting (happy to discuss more in the comments).</p><p>First, context management is one of the most difficult and important things to get right. We’ve found that LLMs really struggle to remember both system prompts and previous user messages in long conversations. Even simple instructions like “ignore sources of type X” in the system prompt are very often ignored. This is exacerbated by multiple tool calls, which can often feed in huge amounts of context. We solved this problem with a “Reminder” prompt—a short 1-3 sentence blurb injected at the end of the user message that describes the non-negotiables that the LLM must abide by. Empirically, LLMs attend most to the very end of the context window, so this placement gives the highest likelihood of adherence.</p><p>Second, we’ve needed to build an understanding of the “natural tendencies” of certain models when using tools, and build around them. For example, the GPT family of models are fine-tuned to use a python code interpreter that operates in a Jupyter notebook. Even if told explicitly, it refuses to add `print()` around the last line, since, in Jupyter, this last line is automatically written to stdout. Other models don’t have this strong preference, so we’ve had to design our model-agnostic code interpreter to also automatically `print()` the last bare line.</p><p>So far, we’ve had a Fortune 100 team fork Onyx and provide 10k+ employees access to every model within a single interface, and create thousands of use-case specific Assistants for every department, each using the best model for the job. We’ve seen teams operating in sensitive industries completely airgap Onyx w/ locally hosted LLMs to provide a copilot that wouldn’t have been possible otherwise.</p><p>If you’d like to try Onyx out, follow <a href="https://docs.onyx.app/deployment/getting_started/quickstart">https://docs.onyx.app/deployment/getting_started/quickstart</a> to get set up locally w/ Docker in &lt;15 minutes. For our Cloud: <a href="https://www.onyx.app/">https://www.onyx.app/</a>. If there’s anything you'd like to see to make it a no-brainer to replace your ChatGPT Enterprise/Claude Enterprise subscription, we’d love to hear it!</p></div></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr></tbody></table><br>

<p>It is rarely newsworthy when a project or package picks up a new
dependency. However, changes in a core tool like Debian's <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/apt-team/apt#apt">Advanced Package
Tool</a> (APT) can have far-reaching effects. For example, Julian
Andres Klode's <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20251031213541.GA73786@debian.org/">declaration</a>
that APT would require Rust in May 2026 means that a few of Debian's
unofficial ports must either acquire a working Rust toolchain or
depend on an old version of APT. This has raised several questions
within the project, particularly about the ability of a single
maintainer to make changes that have widespread impact.</p>

<p>On October 31, Klode sent an announcement to the debian-devel
mailing list that he intended to introduce Rust dependencies and code
into APT as soon as May 2026:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This extends at first to the Rust compiler and standard library, and
the Sequoia ecosystem.</p>

<p>In particular, our code to parse .deb, .ar, .tar, and the HTTP
signature verification code would strongly benefit from memory safe
languages and a stronger approach to unit testing.</p>

<p>If you maintain a port without a working Rust toolchain,
please ensure it has one within the next 6 months, or
sunset the port.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Klode added this was necessary so that the project as a whole could
move forward, rely on modern technologies, "<q>and not be held back by
trying to shoehorn modern software on retro computing
devices</q>". Some Debian developers have welcomed the news. Paul
Tagliamonte <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/CAO6P2QQD8MDUTAo_F=kGfDsBF0Xv+Wv020dm-n-WGnb7ODYW-g@mail.gmail.com">acknowledged</a>
that it would impact unofficial Debian ports but called the push
toward Rust "<q>welcome news</q>".</p>

<p>However, John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/ad6e60711c8ed3372ed7f324d7b1be23b0722a0d.camel@physik.fu-berlin.de/">complained</a>
that Klode's wording was unpleasant and that the approach was
confrontational. In <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/afb7c58fb0fb995ebde3fb72b4cc4d1943a37923.camel@physik.fu-berlin.de/">another
message</a>, he explained that he was not against adoption of Rust; he
had worked on enabling Rust on many of the Debian architectures and
helped to fix architecture-specific bugs in the Rust toolchain as well
as LLVM upstream. However, the message strongly suggested there was no room
for a change in plan: Klode had ended his message with "<q>thank you for
understanding</q>", which invited no further discussion. Glaubitz was
one of a few Debian developers who expressed discomfort with Klode's
communication style in the message.</p>

<p>Klode <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20251031223819.GA97356@debian.org">noted</a>,
briefly, that Rust was already a hard requirement for all Debian
release architectures and ports, except for <a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/alpha/">Alpha (alpha)</a>, <a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/m68k/">Motorola 680x0 (m68k)</a>,
<a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/hppa/">PA-RISC (hppa)</a>, and
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SH4">SuperH (sh4)</a>, because of
APT's use of the <a href="https://sequoia-pgp.org/">Sequoia-PGP</a>
project's <a href="https://packages.debian.org/trixie/sqv"><tt>sqv</tt></a> tool to
verify <a href="https://openpgp.dev/book/signatures.html">OpenPGP</a>
signatures. APT falls back to using the GNU Privacy Guard
signature-verification tool, <a href="https://packages.debian.org/trixie/gpgv"><tt>gpgv</tt></a>, on
ports that do not have a Rust compiler. By depending directly on Rust,
though, APT itself would not be available on ports without a Rust
compiler. LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1045363/">recently
covered</a> the state of Linux architecture support, and the status of
Rust support for each one.</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>None of the ports listed by Klode are among those <a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/#:~:text=List%20of%20official%20ports,-These">officially
supported</a> by Debian today, or targeted for support in
Debian&nbsp;14 ("forky"). The sh4 port has never been officially
supported, and none of the other ports have been supported since
Debian&nbsp;6.0. The actual impact on the ports lacking Rust is also
less dramatic than it sounded at first. Glaubitz <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/708d1a6e63d53242cf89f01c2d791e91f1eccab6.camel@physik.fu-berlin.de/">assured</a>
Antoni Boucher that "<q>the ultimatum that Julian set doesn't really
exist</q>", but phrasing it that way "<q>gets more attention in the
news</q>". Boucher is the maintainer of <a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/rustc_codegen_gcc"><tt>rust_codegen_gcc</tt></a>,
a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/954787/#codegen_gcc">GCC
ahead-of-time code generator for Rust</a>. Nothing, Glaubitz said,
stops ports from using a non-Rust version of APT until Boucher and
others manage to bootstrap Rust for those ports.</p>

<h4>Security theater?</h4>

<p>David Kalnischkies, who is also a <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/apt-team/apt/-/commits/main?author=David%20Kalnischkies">major
contributor</a> to APT, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/sdi72zvp4koyi7h7wo2bwslds2j466ix4sar7wuaks3szphjmp@xg6itydwhqbp/">suggested</a>
that if the goal is to reduce bugs, it would be better to remove the
code that is used to parse the .deb, .ar, and .tar formats that Klode
mentioned from APT entirely. It is only needed for two tools, <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/apt-utils/apt-ftparchive.1.en.html"><tt>apt-ftparchive</tt></a>
and <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/apt-utils/apt-extracttemplates.1.en.html"><tt>apt-extracttemplates</tt></a>,
he said, and the only "<q>serious usage</q>" of
<tt>apt-ftparchive</tt> was by Klode's employer, Canonical, for its <a href="https://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a> software-collaboration
platform. If those were taken out of the main APT code base, then it
would not matter whether they were written in Rust, Python, or another
language, since the tools are not directly necessary for any given
port.</p>

<p>Kalnischkies also questioned the claim that Rust was necessary to
achieve the stronger approach to unit testing that Klode mentioned:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can certainly do unit tests in C++, we do. The main problem is
that someone has to write those tests. Like docs.</p>

<p>Your new solver e.g. has none (apart from our preexisting integration
tests). You don't seriously claim that is because of C++ ?
If you don't like GoogleTest, which is what we currently have,
I could suggest doctest (as I did in previous installments).
Plenty other frameworks exist with similar or different styles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Klode has not responded to those comments yet, which is a bit
unfortunate given the fact that introducing hard dependencies on
Rust has an impact beyond his own work on APT. It may well be that he
has good answers to the questions, but it can also give the
impression that Klode is simply embracing a trend toward Rust. He is <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/migration-to-rust-coreutils-in-25-10/59708">involved</a>
in the Ubuntu <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1014002/">work to migrate from GNU Coreutils to the Rust-based uutils</a>. The reasons given for that work, again, are around
modernization and better security—but security is not automatically 
guaranteed simply by switching to Rust, and there are a number of
other considerations.</p>

<p>For example, Adrian Bunk <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/aQkl0qyIyJ5+y5lC@localhost/">pointed
out</a> that there are a number of Debian teams, as well as tooling,
that will be impacted by writing some of APT in Rust. The release
notes for Debian&nbsp;13 ("trixie") <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.html#go-and-rust-based-packages">mention</a>
that Debian's infrastructure "<q>currently has problems with
rebuilding packages of types that systematically use static
linking</q>", such as those with code written in Go and Rust. Thus, "<q>these packages will be
covered by limited security support until the infrastructure is
improved to deal with them maintainably</q>". Limited security support
means that updates to Rust libraries are likely to only be released
when Debian publishes a point release, which happens about every two
months. The security team has <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1106154#10">specifically
stated</a> that <tt>sqv</tt> is fully supported, but there are still
outstanding problems.</p>

<p>Due to the static-linking issue, any time one of <tt>sqv</tt>'s
dependencies, currently more than 40 Rust crates, have to be rebuilt
due to a security issue, <tt>sqv</tt> (at least potentially) also
needs to be rebuilt. There are also difficulties in tracking CVEs for
all of its dependencies, and understanding when a security
vulnerability in a Rust crate may require updating a Rust program that
depends on it.</p>

<p>Fabian Grünbichler, a maintainer of Debian's Rust toolchain, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/c818f7ef-eff7-40ac-b153-a88412f71d86@app.fastmail.com/">listed</a>
several outstanding problems Debian has with dealing with Rust
packages. One of the largest is the need for a consistent Debian policy for declaring
statically linked libraries. In 2022, Guillem Jover added a control
field for Debian packages called Static-Built-Using (SBU), which would list
the source packages used to build a binary package. This would
indicate when a binary package needs to be rebuilt due to an update in
another source package. For example, <tt>sqv</tt> depends on more than
40 Rust crates that are packaged for Debian. Without declaring the
SBUs, it may not be clear if <tt>sqv</tt> needs to be updated when one
of its dependencies is updated. Debian has been working on a <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1069256">policy
requirement for SBU</a> since April 2024, but it is not yet finished
or adopted.</p>

<p>The discussion sparked by Grünbichler makes clear that most of
Debian's Rust-related problems are in the process of being
solved. However, there's no evidence that Klode explored the problems
before declaring that APT would depend on Rust, or even asked "is this
a reasonable time frame to introduce this dependency?"</p>

<h4>Where tradition meets tomorrow</h4>

<p>Debian's tagline, or at least one of its taglines, is "the
universal operating system", meaning that the project aims to run on a
wide variety of hardware (old and new) and be usable on the desktop,
server, IoT devices, and more. The "<a href="https://www.debian.org/intro/why_debian">Why Debian</a>" page
lists a number of reasons users and developers should choose the
distribution: <a href="https://www.debian.org/ports">multiple hardware
architectures</a>, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS">long-term
support</a>, and its <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution">democratic governance
structure</a> are just a few of the arguments it puts forward in favor
of Debian. It also notes that "<q>Debian cannot be controlled by a
single company</q>". A single developer employed by a company to work
on Debian tools pushing a change that seems beneficial to that
company, without discussion or debate, that impacts multiple hardware
architectures and that requires other volunteers to do unplanned work
or meet an artificial deadline seems to go against many of the
project's stated values.</p>

<p>Debian, of course, does have checks and balances that could be
employed if other Debian developers feel it necessary. Someone could,
for example, appeal to Debian's <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/tech-ctte">Technical Committee</a>,
or sponsor a general resolution to override a developer if they cannot
be persuaded by discussion alone. That happened recently when the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1041316/">committee required systemd
maintainers to provide the <tt>/var/lock</tt> directory</a> "<q>until
a satisfactory migration of impacted software has occurred and Policy
updated accordingly</q>".</p>

<p>However, it also seems fair to point out that Debian can move
slowly, even glacially, at times. APT <a href="https://mvogt.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/apt-1-1-released/">added</a>
support for the <a href="https://repolib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deb822-format.html">DEB822</a>
format for its source information lists in 2015. Despite APT
supporting that format for years, Klode faced resistance in 2021, when
he <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20211103163429.GA3688731@debian.org/">pushed
for Debian to move to the new format</a> ahead of the Debian&nbsp;12
("bookworm") release in 2021, but was unsuccessful. It is now the
default for trixie with the move to <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1017315/">APT&nbsp;3.0</a>, though APT
will continue to support the old format for years to come.</p>

<p>The fact is, regardless of what Klode does with APT, more and more
free software is being written (or rewritten) in Rust. Making it
easier to support that software when it is packaged for Debian is to
everyone's benefit. Perhaps the project needs some developers who will
be aggressive about pushing the project to move more quickly in
improving its support for Rust. However, what is really needed is more
developers lending a hand to do the work that is needed to support
Rust in Debian and elsewhere, such as <a href="https://rust-gcc.github.io/"><tt>gccrs</tt></a>. It does not
seem in keeping with Debian's community focus for a single developer
to simply declare dependencies that other volunteers will have to
scramble to support.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Scientists have identified five major “epochs” of human brain development in one of the most comprehensive studies to date of how neural wiring changes from infancy to old age.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65974-8" data-link-name="in body link">The study</a>, based on the brain scans of nearly 4,000 people aged under one to 90, mapped neural connections and how they evolve during our lives. This revealed five broad phases, split up by four pivotal “turning points” in which brain organisation moves on to a different trajectory, at around the ages of nine, 32, 66 and 83 years.</p><p>“Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterised by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras,” said Prof Duncan Astle, a researcher in neuroinformatics at Cambridge University and senior author of the study.</p><p>“Understanding that the brain’s structural journey is not a question of steady progression, but rather one of a few major turning points, will help us identify when and how its wiring is vulnerable to disruption.”</p><p>The childhood period of development was found to occur between birth until the age of nine, when it transitions to the adolescent phase – an era that lasts up to the age of 32, on average.</p><p>In a person’s early 30s the brain’s neural wiring shifts into adult mode – the longest era, lasting more than three decades. A third turning point around the age of 66 marks the start of an “early ageing” phase of brain architecture. Finally, the “late ageing” brain takes shape at around 83 years old.</p><p>The scientists quantified brain organisation using 12 different measures, including the efficiency of the wiring, how compartmentalised it is and whether the brain relies heavily on central hubs or has a more diffuse connectivity network.</p><p>From infancy through childhood, our brains are defined by “network consolidation”, as the wealth of synapses – the connectors between neurons – in a baby’s brain are whittled down, with the more active ones surviving. During this period, the study found, the efficiency of the brain’s wiring decreases.</p><p>Meanwhile, grey and white matter grow rapidly in volume, so that cortical thickness – the distance between outer grey matter and inner white matter – reaches a peak, and cortical folding, the characteristic ridges on the outer brain, stabilises.</p><p>In the second “epoch” of the brain, the adolescence era, white matter continues to grow in volume, so organisation of the brain’s communications networks is increasingly refined. This era is defined by steadily increasing efficiency of connections across the whole brain, which is related to enhanced cognitive performance. The epochs were defined by the brain remaining on a constant trend of development over a sustained period, rather than staying in a fixed state throughout.</p><p>“We’re definitely not saying that people in their late 20s are going to be acting like teenagers, or even that their brain looks like that of a teenager,” said Alexa Mousley, who led the research. “It’s really the pattern of change.”</p><p>She added that the findings could give insights into risk factors for mental health disorders, which most frequently emerge during the adolescent period.</p><p>At around the age of 32 the strongest overall shift in trajectory is seen. Life events such as parenthood may play a role in some of the changes seen, although the research did not explicitly test this. “We know that women who give birth, their brain changes afterwards,” said Mousley. “It’s reasonable to assume that there could be a relationship between these milestones and what’s happening in the brain.”</p><p>From 32 years, the brain architecture appears to stabilise compared with previous phases, corresponding with a “plateau in intelligence and personality” based on other studies. Brain regions also become more compartmentalised.</p><p>The final two turning points were defined by decreases in brain connectivity, which were believed to be related to ageing and degeneration of white matter in the brain.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Without diving into the debate, it’s clear that software development remains one of the riskiest technological endeavors to undertake.

A<a href="https://services.global.ntt/en-us/newsroom/80-percent-of-organizations-agree-that-inadequate-or-outdated-technology-is-holding-back-innovation" target="_blank"> 2024 report</a> by services company <a href="https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/" target="_blank">NTT DATA</a> found that 80 percent of organizations concede that “inadequate or outdated technology is holding back organizational progress and innovation efforts.” Furthermore, the report says that virtually all C-level executives believe legacy infrastructure thwarts their ability to respond to the market. Even so, given that the cost of replacing legacy systems is typically many multiples of the cost of supporting them, business executives <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/inside-hidden-world-legacy-it-systems" target="_self">hesitate to replace them</a> until it is no longer operationally feasible or cost-effective. The other reason is a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/lessons-from-a-decade-of-it-failures/lesson-4" target="_self">well-founded fear</a> that replacing them will turn into a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/debacle">debacle</a> like Phoenix or<a href="https://www.stripes.com/veterans/2025-07-15/veterans-technology-medical-records-18443763.html#:~:text=VA%20leaders%20delivered%20that%20message,according%20to%20the%20federal%20watchdog." target="_blank"> others</a><span>.</span></p><p>Nevertheless, there have been ongoing attempts to improve software development and sustainment processes.

However, the same requirements have always been true when introducing any new software platform. Given the historic lack of organizational resolve to instill proven practices, it is not surprising that novel approaches for developing and sustaining ever more complex software systems, no matter how effective they may be, will also frequently fall short.</p><h2>Persisting in Foolish Errors<br></h2><p>The frustrating and perpetual question is why basic IT project-management and governance mistakes during software development and operations continue to occur so often, given the near-total societal reliance on reliable software and an extensively documented history of failures to learn from? Next to electrical infrastructure, with which IT is increasingly merging into a mutually codependent relationship, the failure of our computing systems is an existential threat to modern society.</p><p>Frustratingly, the IT community <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7842842" target="_blank">stubbornly fails to learn</a> from prior failures. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/it-project">IT project</a> managers <a href="https://hbr.org/2025/03/the-uniqueness-trap" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">routinely claim</a> that their project is somehow different or unique and, thus, lessons from previous failures are irrelevant. That is the excuse of the arrogant, though usually not the ignorant.

Phoenix project managers ignored the well-documented reasons for the first failure because they claimed its lessons were not applicable, which did nothing to keep the managers from repeating them. As it’s been said, we learn more from failure than from success, but repeated failures are damn expensive.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem13" data-id="13" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/it-management-software-failures/particle-13" data-basename="particle-13" data-post-id="2674305315" data-published-at="1763498559" data-use-pagination="False"><p>Not all software development failures are bad; some failures are even desired. When pushing the limits of developing new types of software products, technologies, or practices, as is happening with AI-related efforts, potential failure is an accepted possibility. With failure, experience increases, new insights are gained, fixes are made, constraints are better understood, and technological innovation and progress continue. However, most IT failures today are not related to pushing the innovative frontiers of the computing art, but the edges of the mundane. They do not represent Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter’s “<a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/CreativeDestruction.html" target="_blank">gales of creative destruction</a>.” They’re more like gales of financial destruction. Just how many more <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/278677/enterprise-resource-planning-10-famous-erp-disasters-dustups-and-disappointments.html" target="_blank">enterprise resource planning (ERP) project failures</a> are needed before success becomes routine? Such failures should be called IT blunders, as learning anything new from them is dubious at best.</p><p>Was Phoenix a failure or a blunder? I argue strongly for the latter, but at the very least, Phoenix serves as a master class in IT <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/project-mismanagement">project mismanagement</a>. The question is whether the Canadian government learned from this experience any more than it did from 1995’s payroll-project fiasco? <a href="https://www.thealbertan.com/national-news/fixing-problems-with-phoenix-payroll-system-cost-taxpayers-51-billion-official-10851998" target="_blank">The government maintains it will learn</a>, which might be true, given the Phoenix failure’s high political profile.

Both used questionable algorithms to identify deceptive payment claims without human oversight. State officials used MiDAS to accuse tens of thousands of Michiganders of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/unemployment">unemployment</a> fraud, while Centrelink officials falsely accused hundreds of thousands of Australians of being welfare cheats. Untold numbers of lives will never be the same because of what occurred. Government officials in Michigan and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/australia">Australia</a> placed far too much trust in those algorithms. They had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to acknowledge that something was amiss, even after it was clearly demonstrated that the software was untrustworthy. Even then, officials tried to downplay the errors’ impact on people, then fought against paying compensation to those adversely affected by the errors. While such behavior is legally termed “maladministration,” <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057305" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">administrative evil</a> is closer to reality.</p></div><p>So, we are left with only a professional and personal obligation to reemphasize the obvious: Ask what you do know, what you should know, and how big the gap is between them before embarking on creating an IT system. If no one else has ever successfully built your system with the schedule, budget, and functionality you asked for, please explain why your organization thinks it can. Software is inherently fragile; building complex, secure, and resilient software systems is difficult, detailed, and time-consuming. Small errors have outsize effects, each with an almost infinite number of ways they can manifest, from causing a minor functional error to a system outage to allowing a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> threat to penetrate the system. The more complex and interconnected the system, the more opportunities for errors and their exploitation. A nice start would be for senior management who control the purse strings to finally treat software and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/systems-development">systems development</a>, operations, and sustainment efforts with the respect they deserve.

										<p>In the summer of 1994 Naughty Dog, Inc. was still a two-man company, myself and my longtime partner Jason Rubin. Over the&nbsp;preceding eight years,&nbsp;we had published six&nbsp;games as a lean and mean duo, but&nbsp;the time had come to expand. In…</p>

										<p>So what was it that Sega and Nintendo had in 1994, but Sony didn’t?<br>
An existing competing mascot character. Sega had Sonic and Nintendo had Mario, but Sony product slate was blank.<br>
So we set about creating a mascot on the theory that maybe, just maybe, we might be able to slide into that opening. I’m still surprised it worked.</p>

										<p>While all this art design was going on, I, and then in January 1995, Dave, struggled to build an engine and tool pipeline that would make it possible to render these grandiose cartoon worlds we had envisioned on paper. Since during fall of 1994 Jason was also the only artist, he frantically generated all the source material and banged on my head to make sure it would look incredible.</p>

										<p>We were forging new gameplay ground, causing a lot of growing pains. The control of the main character is the single most important thing in a CAG. I did all the programming, but Mark helped whip me along. For example saying, “he doesn’t stop fast enough,” or “he needs to be able to jump for a frame or two AFTER he’s run off a cliff or it will be frustrating.” Criticism is essential, and as a programmer who wrote dozens of world class control schemes in the years between 1994 and 2004, I rewrote every one at least five or six times. Iteration is king.</p>

										<p>But once the core gameplay worked, these cool levels were missing something. We’d spent so many polygons on our detailed backgrounds and “realistic” cartoon characters that the enemies weren’t that dense, so everything felt a bit empty.</p>

										<p>Not only did we need to finish our E3 demo, but we needed a real name for the game — Willie the Wombat wasn’t going to cut it. Now, in the Naughty Dog office proper we knew he was a Bandicoot. In fact, we liked the idea of using an action name for him, like Crash, Dash, Smash, and Bash — fallout from the visceral reaction to smashing so many boxes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A couple of weeks ago, I decided to do away with my Netflix subscription. I simply was barely using it, and whenever I did it was more out of habit than it really being the thing I wanted to do with my time. Sure, there's still some decent stuff on there, but the vast majority of it feels absolutely moneyballed. Good, but somehow <em>too good</em>, and with no character.</p>

<p>As much as I'd love to elaborate on why I think Netflix is evil, that's not todays topic. What I wanted to share is how for approximately the price I was paying for my subscription (€19.99), I've snapped up three subscriptions that I'm using on a daily basis. They're all pretty much interchangeable with other alternatives. The main thing I want to highlight is the individual slot they each fill out for me.</p>

<h2 id="1-a-subscription-to-zed-pro-10">1. A subscription to Zed Pro (~€10)</h2>

<p>Frankly, I haven't really put too much thought into whether the unit economics are the best here. The main point is, these are €10 that make my coding experience more pleasant, and get me writing more code in my spare time. In that sense it's money well spent.</p>

<p>Does it matter if you get a Cursor subscription, or a Zed one, or whatever else is in vogue when you're reading? No, just get the thing that will get you excited to get your hands on the keyboard!
To me, Zed feels more intentionally built than the VSClones: things flow nicely, it feels snappy, the ui is less cluttered... It's just <em>nice</em>.</p>

<p>Editor preferences aside, the main takeaway is, invest in a hobby you actively engage in. Make that little bit more appealing and you have one more reason to be spending your time doing the thing that makes you feel good, rather than letting a couple hours a day evaporate watching another forgettable show.</p>

<h2 id="2-a-kagi-subscription-5-month">2. A Kagi subscription (~€5/month)</h2>

<p>I think we can mostly agree google kind of sucks nowadays. Whenever I search, I automatically scroll down to skip the sponsored posts and SEO maxxed websites, and still don't fully trust what I get. Maybe that's why we all started appending “reddit” the end of our searches.</p>

<p>Are the search results themselves better with Kagi? To be honest, I can't tell yet, others have written far more informed takes on the topic. What does it for me is the simple fact of being able to pay directly for a service that I use, and value, rather than having to trade my attention in and endure a wall of ads. Especially if it's something I use over and over, every day. That's what I mean to highlight here: we can support products that we enjoy by paying for them (who would have thought?) rather than letting them lobotomize us via ad feeds.</p>

<h2 id="3-a-cheap-server-on-hetzner-4-month">3. A cheap server on Hetzner (~€4/month)</h2>

<p>Again, the choice of provider here is secondary. The point is, I finally have my little stake on the internet. It's relatively barebones, and I like that. It forces me to learn and engage. In fact, that is where my blog is hosted!</p>

<p>So to sum it up: We don't <em>have</em> to default to a streaming subscription because that's become the standard human-being thing to do. For the same money you can build a suite of useful, well crafted tools that help you:
– Get the most out of your hobbies
– Spend less time looking at ads
– Build things you can share with the world</p>

<p>P.S. Not one word here was written by AI. I plan on keeping it that way for anything that goes on this blog. So, if anything reads like slop, it's <em>my</em> slop :)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			
<p>I’ve written before about building <a href="https://austinsnerdythings.com/2021/04/19/microsecond-accurate-ntp-with-a-raspberry-pi-and-pps-gps/">microsecond-accurate NTP servers with Raspberry Pi and GPS PPS</a>, and more recently about <a href="https://austinsnerdythings.com/2025/02/14/revisiting-microsecond-accurate-ntp-for-raspberry-pi-with-gps-pps-in-2025/">revisiting the setup in 2025</a>. Both posts focused on the hardware setup and basic configuration to achieve sub-microsecond time synchronization using GPS Pulse Per Second (PPS) signals.</p>



<p>But there was a problem. Despite having a stable PPS reference, my NTP server’s frequency drift was exhibiting significant variation over time. After months (years) of monitoring the system with Grafana dashboards, I noticed something interesting: the frequency oscillations seemed to correlate with CPU temperature changes. The frequency would drift as the CPU heated up during the day and cooled down at night, even though the PPS reference remained rock-solid.</p>



<p>Like clockwork (no pun intended), I somehow get sucked back into trying to improve my setup every 6-8 weeks. This post is the latest on that never-ending quest.</p>



<p>This post details how I achieved an <strong>81% reduction in frequency variability</strong> and <strong>77% reduction in frequency standard deviation</strong> through a combination of CPU core pinning and thermal stabilization. Welcome to Austin’s Nerdy Things, where we solve problems that 99.999% of people (and 99% of datacenters) don’t have.</p>



<h2>The Problem: Thermal-Induced Timing Jitter</h2>



<p>Modern CPUs, including those in Raspberry Pis, use dynamic frequency scaling to save power and manage heat. When the CPU is idle, it runs at a lower frequency (and voltage). When load increases, it scales up. This is great for power efficiency, but terrible for precision timekeeping.</p>



<p>Why? Because timekeeping (with NTP/chronyd/others) relies on a stable system clock to discipline itself against reference sources. If the CPU frequency is constantly changing, the system clock’s tick rate varies, introducing jitter into the timing measurements. Even though my PPS signal was providing a mostly perfect 1-pulse-per-second reference, the CPU’s frequency bouncing around made it harder for chronyd to maintain a stable lock.</p>



<p>But here’s the key insight: <strong>the system clock is ultimately derived from a crystal oscillator</strong>, and crystal oscillator frequency is temperature-dependent. The oscillator sits on the board near the CPU, and as the CPU heats up and cools down throughout the day, so does the crystal. Even a few degrees of temperature change can shift the oscillator’s frequency by parts per million – exactly what I was seeing in my frequency drift graphs. The CPU frequency scaling was one factor, but the underlying problem was that temperature changes were affecting the crystal oscillator itself. By stabilizing the CPU temperature, I could stabilize the thermal environment for the crystal oscillator, keeping its frequency consistent.</p>



<p>Looking at my Grafana dashboard, I could see the frequency offset wandering over a range of about 1 PPM (parts per million) as the Pi warmed up and cooled down throughout the day. The RMS offset was averaging around 86 nanoseconds, which isn’t terrible (it’s actually really, really, really good), but I knew it could be better.</p>



<h2>The Discovery</h2>



<p>After staring at graphs for longer than I’d like to admit, I had an idea: what if I could keep the CPU at a constant temperature? If the temperature (and therefore the frequency) stayed stable, maybe the timing would stabilize too.</p>



<p>The solution came in two parts:</p>



<p>1. <strong>CPU core isolation</strong> – Dedicate CPU 0 exclusively to timing-critical tasks (chronyd and PPS interrupts) 2. <strong>Thermal stabilization</strong> – Keep the other CPUs busy to maintain a constant temperature, preventing frequency scaling</p>



<p>Here’s what happened when I turned on the thermal stabilization system on November 17, 2025 at 09:10 AM:</p>

<p>That vertical red line marks when I activated the “time burner” process. Notice how the frequency oscillations immediately dampen and settle into a much tighter band? Let’s dive into how this works.</p>



<h2>The Solution Part 1: CPU Core Pinning and Real-Time Priority</h2>



<p>The first step is isolating timing-critical operations onto a dedicated CPU core. On a Raspberry Pi (4-core ARM), this means:</p>



<ul>
<li>CPU 0: Reserved for chronyd and PPS interrupts</li>



<li>CPUs 1-3: Everything else, including our thermal load</li>
</ul>



<p>I had AI (probably Claude Sonnet 4 ish, maybe 4.5) create a boot optimization script that runs at system startup:</p>



<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# PPS NTP Server Performance Optimization Script
# Sets CPU affinity, priorities, and performance governor at boot

set -e

echo "Setting up PPS NTP server performance optimizations..."

# Wait for system to be ready
sleep 5

# Set CPU governor to performance mode
echo "Setting CPU governor to performance..."
cpupower frequency-set -g performance

# Pin PPS interrupt to CPU0 (may fail if already pinned, that's OK)
echo "Configuring PPS interrupt affinity..."
echo 1 &gt; /proc/irq/200/smp_affinity 2&gt;/dev/null || echo "PPS IRQ already configured"

# Wait for chronyd to start
echo "Waiting for chronyd to start..."
timeout=30
while [ $timeout -gt 0 ]; do
    chronyd_pid=$(pgrep chronyd 2&gt;/dev/null || echo "")
    if [ -n "$chronyd_pid" ]; then
        echo "Found chronyd PID: $chronyd_pid"
        break
    fi
    sleep 1
    ((timeout--))
done

if [ -z "$chronyd_pid" ]; then
    echo "Warning: chronyd not found after 30 seconds"
else
    # Set chronyd to real-time priority and pin to CPU 0
    echo "Setting chronyd to real-time priority and pinning to CPU 0..."
    chrt -f -p 50 $chronyd_pid
    taskset -cp 0 $chronyd_pid
fi

# Boost ksoftirqd/0 priority
echo "Boosting ksoftirqd/0 priority..."
ksoftirqd_pid=$(ps aux | grep '\[ksoftirqd/0\]' | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}')
if [ -n "$ksoftirqd_pid" ]; then
    renice -n -10 $ksoftirqd_pid
    echo "ksoftirqd/0 priority boosted (PID: $ksoftirqd_pid)"
else
    echo "Warning: ksoftirqd/0 not found"
fi

echo "PPS NTP optimization complete!"

# Log current status
echo "=== Current Status ==="
echo "CPU Governor: $(cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor)"
echo "PPS IRQ Affinity: $(cat /proc/irq/200/effective_affinity_list 2&gt;/dev/null || echo 'not readable')"
if [ -n "$chronyd_pid" ]; then
    echo "chronyd Priority: $(chrt -p $chronyd_pid)"
fi
echo "======================"</code></pre>



<p><strong>What this does:</strong></p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Performance Governor</strong>: Forces all CPUs to run at maximum frequency, disabling frequency scaling</li>



<li><strong>PPS IRQ Pinning</strong>: Ensures PPS interrupt (IRQ 200) is handled exclusively by CPU 0</li>



<li><strong>Chronyd Real-Time Priority</strong>: Sets chronyd to SCHED_FIFO priority 50, giving it preferential CPU scheduling</li>



<li>C<strong>hronyd CPU Affinity</strong>: Pins chronyd to CPU 0 using <code>taskset</code></li>



<li><strong>ksoftirqd Priority Boost</strong>: Improves priority of the kernel softirq handler on CPU 0</li>
</ol>



<p>This script can be added to <code>/etc/rc.local</code> or as a systemd service to run at boot.</p>



<h2>The Solution Part 2: PID-Controlled Thermal Stabilization</h2>



<p>Setting the performance governor helps, but on a Raspberry Pi, even at max frequency, the CPU temperature will still vary based on ambient conditions and load. Temperature changes affect the CPU’s actual operating frequency due to thermal characteristics of the silicon.</p>



<p>The solution? Keep the CPU at a constant temperature using a PID-controlled thermal load. I call it the “time burner” (inspired by CPU burn-in tools, but with precise temperature control).</p>



<p>As a reminder of what we’re really doing here: <strong>we’re maintaining a stable thermal environment for the crystal oscillator</strong>. The RPi 3B’s 19.2 MHz oscillator is physically located near the CPU on the Raspberry Pi board, so by actively controlling CPU temperature, we’re indirectly controlling the oscillator’s temperature. Since the oscillator’s frequency is temperature-dependent (this is basic physics of quartz crystals), keeping it at a constant temperature means keeping its frequency stable – which is exactly what we need for precise timekeeping.</p>



<p>Here’s how it works:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Read CPU temperature</strong> from <code>/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp</code> </li>



<li><strong>PID controller</strong> calculates how much CPU time to burn to maintain target temperature (I chose 54°C) </li>



<li><strong>Three worker processes</strong> run on CPUs 1, 2, and 3 (avoiding CPU 0) </li>



<li><strong>Each worker</strong> alternates between busy-loop (MD5 hashing) and sleeping based on PID output </li>



<li><strong>Temperature stabilizes</strong> at the setpoint, preventing thermal drift</li>
</ol>



<p>Here’s the core implementation (simplified for readability):</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

<p>The full implementation includes a temperature filtering system to smooth out sensor noise and command-line arguments for tuning the PID parameters.</p>



<p><strong>PID Tuning Notes:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Kp=0.05</strong>: Proportional gain – responds to current error</li>



<li><strong>Ki=0.02</strong>: Integral gain – eliminates steady-state error</li>



<li><strong>Kd=0.0</strong>: Derivative gain – set to zero because temperature changes slowly</li>
</ul>



<p>The target temperature of 54°C was chosen empirically – high enough to keep the CPU from idling down, but low enough to avoid thermal throttling (which starts around 80°C on Raspberry Pi).</p>



<h2>The Results: Numbers Don’t Lie</h2>



<p>The improvement was immediately visible. Here are the statistics comparing performance before and after the optimization:</p>



<p><strong>A note on ambient conditions:</strong> The Raspberry Pi lives in a project enclosure in our master bedroom (chosen for its decent GPS reception and ADS-B coverage for a new <a href="https://skyspottr.com/map/">aircraft AR overlay app idea I’m working on</a> also running on this Pi). While the time burner maintains the CPU die temperature at 54°C, the enclosure is still subject to ambient temperature swings. Room temperature cycles from a low of 66°F (18.9°C) at 5:15 AM to a peak of 72°F (22.2°C) at 11:30 AM – a 6°F daily swing from our heating schedule. The fact that we see such dramatic frequency stability improvements <em>despite</em> this ambient variation speaks to how effective the thermal control is. The CPU’s active heating overwhelms the environmental changes, maintaining consistent silicon temperature where it matters most.</p>



<h3>Frequency Stability</h3>

<p>The RMS offset is chronyd’s estimate of the timing uncertainty. Cutting this nearly in half means the system is maintaining significantly better time accuracy.</p>



<h2>Setup Instructions</h2>



<p>Want to replicate this? Here’s the step-by-step process:</p>



<h3>Prerequisites</h3>



<p>You need a working GPS PPS NTP server setup. If you don’t have one yet, follow my <a href="https://austinsnerdythings.com/2025/02/14/revisiting-microsecond-accurate-ntp-for-raspberry-pi-with-gps-pps-in-2025/">2025 NTP guide</a> first.</p>



<h3>Step 0: Install Required Tools</h3>



<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install linux-cpupower python3 util-linux</code></pre>



<h3>Step 1: Create the Boot Optimization Script</h3>



<p>Save the optimization script from earlier as <code>/usr/local/bin/pps-optimize.sh</code>:</p>



<pre><code>sudo nano /usr/local/bin/pps-optimize.sh
# Paste the script content
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pps-optimize.sh</code></pre>



<h3>Step 2: Create Systemd Service for Boot Script</h3>



<p>Create <code>/etc/systemd/system/pps-optimize.service</code>:</p>



<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=PPS NTP Performance Optimization
After=chronyd.service
Requires=chronyd.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/pps-optimize.sh
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</code></pre>



<p>Enable it:</p>



<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable pps-optimize.service</code></pre>



<h3>Step 3: Install the Time Burner Script</h3>



<p>Save the time burner Python script as <code>/usr/local/bin/time_burner.py</code>:</p>



<pre><code>sudo nano /usr/local/bin/time_burner.py
# Paste the full time burner script
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/time_burner.py</code></pre>



<h3>Step 4: Create Systemd Service for Time Burner</h3>



<p>Create <code>/etc/systemd/system/time-burner.service</code>:</p>



<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=CPU Thermal Stabilization for NTP
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/time_burner.py -t 54.0 -n 3
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</code></pre>



<p>Enable and start it:</p>



<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable time-burner.service
sudo systemctl start time-burner.service</code></pre>



<h3>Step 5: Verify the Setup</h3>



<p>Check that everything is running:</p>



<pre><code># Verify CPU governor
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
# Should output: performance

# Check chronyd CPU affinity and priority
ps -eo pid,comm,psr,ni,rtprio | grep chronyd
# Should show psr=0 (CPU 0) and rtprio=50

# Check time burner processes
ps aux | grep time_burner
# Should show 4 processes (1 main + 3 workers)

# Monitor NTP performance
chronyc tracking</code></pre>



<p>Example output from <code>chronyc tracking</code>:</p>



<pre><code>Reference ID    : 50505300 (PPS)
Stratum         : 1
Ref time (UTC)  : Sun Nov 24 16:45:23 2025
System time     : 0.000000038 seconds fast of NTP time
Last offset     : -0.000000012 seconds
RMS offset      : 0.000000035 seconds
Frequency       : 1.685 ppm slow
Residual freq   : -0.001 ppm
Skew            : 0.002 ppm
Root delay      : 0.000000001 seconds
Root dispersion : 0.000010521 seconds
Update interval : 16.0 seconds
Leap status     : Normal</code></pre>



<p>Notice the RMS offset of 35 nanoseconds – this is the kind of accuracy you can achieve with thermal stabilization.</p>



<h3>Step 6: Monitor Over Time</h3>



<p>(Topic for a future post)</p>



<p>Set up Grafana dashboards to monitor:</p>



<ul>
<li>Frequency offset (PPM)</li>



<li>RMS offset (nanoseconds)</li>



<li>CPU temperature</li>



<li>System time offset</li>
</ul>



<p>You’ll see the frequency stabilize within a few hours as the PID controller locks onto the target temperature.</p>



<h2>Monitoring and Troubleshooting</h2>



<h3>Real-Time Monitoring</h3>



<p>Watch chronyd tracking in real-time:</p>



<pre><code>watch -n 1 "chronyc tracking"</code></pre>



<p>Check time burner status:</p>



<pre><code>sudo systemctl status time-burner.service</code></pre>



<p>View time burner output:</p>



<pre><code>sudo journalctl -u time-burner.service -f</code></pre>



<h3>Common Issues</h3>



<p><strong>Temperature overshoots or oscillates:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Adjust PID gains – reduce Kp if oscillating, increase Ki if steady-state error</li>



<li>Try different target temperatures (50-60°C range)</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>High CPU usage (obviously):</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>This is intentional – the time burner uses ~90% of 3 cores</li>



<li>Not suitable for Pis running other workloads</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Chronyd not pinned to CPU 0:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Check that the optimization script runs after chronyd starts</li>



<li>Adjust the timing in the systemd service dependencies</li>
</ul>



<h2>Trade-offs and Considerations</h2>



<p>Let’s be honest about the downsides:</p>



<h3>Power Consumption</h3>



<p>The time burner keeps 3 cores at ~30% average utilization. My Pi now draws about 3-4W continuously (vs 1-2W idle). Over a year, that’s an extra 15-25 kWh, or about $2-3 in electricity (depending on your rates).</p>



<h3>Heat</h3>



<p>Running at 54°C means the Pi is warm to the touch. This is well within safe operating temperature (thermal throttling doesn’t start until 80°C), but you might want to ensure adequate ventilation. I added a small heatsink just to be safe.</p>



<h3>CPU Resources</h3>



<p>You’re dedicating 3 of 4 cores to burning cycles. This is fine for a dedicated NTP server, but not suitable if you’re running other services on the same Pi. That said, I am also running the feeder to my new <a href="https://skyspottr.com/map/">ADS-B aircraft visualization app</a> on it. My readsb instance regularly gets to 1200 msg/s with 200+ aircraft.</p>



<h3>Is It Worth It?</h3>



<p>For 99.999% of use cases: <strong>absolutely not</strong>.</p>



<p>Most applications don’t need better than millisecond accuracy, let alone the 35-nanosecond RMS offset I’m achieving. Even for distributed systems, microsecond-level accuracy is typically overkill.</p>



<p><strong>When this might make sense:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Precision timing applications</strong> (scientific instrumentation, radio astronomy)</li>



<li><strong>Distributed systems research</strong> requiring tight clock synchronization</li>



<li><strong>Network testing</strong> where timing precision affects results</li>



<li><strong>Because you can</strong> (the best reason for any homelab project)</li>
</ul>



<p>For me, this falls squarely in the “because you can” category. I had the monitoring infrastructure in place, noticed the thermal correlation, and couldn’t resist solving the problem. Plus, I learned a lot about PID control, CPU thermal characteristics, and Linux real-time scheduling.</p>



<h2>Future Improvements</h2>



<p>Some ideas I’m considering:</p>



<h3>Adaptive PID Tuning</h3>



<p>The current PID gains are hand-tuned for a specific ambient temperature range. The fairly low P value is to avoid spikes when some load on the Pi kicks up the temp. The I is a balance to keep long term “burn” relatively consistent. Implementing an auto-tuning algorithm (like Ziegler-Nichols) or adaptive PID could handle seasonal temperature variations better.</p>



<h3>Hardware Thermal Control</h3>



<p>Instead of software thermal control, I could add an actively cooled heatsink with PWM fan control. This might achieve similar temperature stability while using less power overall.</p>



<h3>Oven-Controlled Crystal Oscillator (OCXO)</h3>



<p>For the ultimate in frequency stability, replacing the Pi’s crystal with a temperature-controlled OCXO would eliminate thermal drift at the source. This is how professional timing equipment works. I do have a BH3SAP GPSDO sitting next to me (subject to a future post)… Then again, I’m the person who just wrote 4000 words about optimizing a $50 time server, so who am I kidding?</p>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>Through a combination of CPU core isolation and PID-controlled thermal stabilization, I achieved:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>81% reduction</strong> in frequency variability</li>



<li><strong>77% reduction</strong> in frequency standard deviation</li>



<li><strong>74% reduction</strong> in frequency range</li>



<li><strong>49% reduction</strong> in RMS offset</li>
</ul>



<p>The system now maintains 38-nanosecond median RMS offset from the GPS PPS reference, with frequency drift that’s barely detectable in the noise. The CPU runs at a constant 54°C, and in steady state, the frequency offset stays within a tight ±0.14 PPM band (compared to ±0.52 PPM before optimization).</p>



<p>Was this necessary? No. Did I learn a bunch about thermal management, PID control, and Linux real-time scheduling? Yes. Would I do it again? Absolutely.</p>



<h3>Resource</h3>



<p>I did come across a “burn” script that was the basis for this thermal management. I can’t find it at the moment, but when I do I’ll link it here.</p>

<ul>
<li>New findings suggest the brain has preconfigured, structured activity patterns even before sensory experiences occur.</li>



<li>UC Santa Cruz researchers used brain organoids to study the brain’s earliest electrical activity.</li>



<li>Understanding early brain patterns could have important implications for diagnosing and treating developmental brain disorders.</li>
</ul>
</div>



<p>Humans have long wondered when and how we begin to form thoughts. Are we born with a pre-configured brain, or do thought patterns only begin to emerge in response to our sensory experiences of the world around us? Now, science is getting closer to answering the questions philosophers have pondered for centuries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, are using tiny models of human brain tissue, called organoids, to study the earliest moments of electrical activity in the brain. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02111-0">A new study</a> in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em> finds that the earliest firings of the brain occur in structured patterns without any external experiences, suggesting that the human brain is preconfigured with instructions about how to navigate and interact with the world.</p>



<p>“These cells are clearly interacting with each other and forming circuits that self-assemble before we can experience anything from the outside world,” said Tal Sharf, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the Baskin School of Engineering and the study’s senior author. “There’s an operating system that exists, that emerges in a primordial state. In my laboratory, we grow brain organoids to peer into this primordial version of the brain’s operating system and study how the brain builds itself before it’s shaped by sensory experience.”</p>



<p>In improving our fundamental understanding of human brain development, these findings can help researchers better understand neurodevelopmental disorders, and pinpoint the impact of toxins like pesticides and microplastics in the developing brain.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="h-studying-the-developing-brain"><strong>Studying the developing brain</strong></h4>



<p>The brain, similar to a computer, runs on electrical signals—the firing of neurons. When these signals begin to fire, and how the human brain develops, are challenging topics for scientists to study, as the early developing human brain is protected within the womb.</p>



<p>Organoids, which are 3D models of tissue grown from human stem cells in the lab, provide a unique window into brain development. The <a href="https://braingeneers.ucsc.edu/">Braingeneers group</a> at UC Santa Cruz, in collaboration with researchers at UC San Francisco and UC Santa Barbara, are pioneering methods to grow these models and take measurements from them to gain insights into brain development and disorders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organoids are particularly useful for understanding if the brain develops in response to sensory input—as they exist in the lab setting and not the body—and can be grown ethically in large quantities. In this study, researchers prompted stem cells to form brain tissue, and then measured their electrical activity using specialized microchips, similar to those that run a computer. Sharf’s background in both applied physics, computation, and neurobiology form his expertise in modelling the circuitry of the early brain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“An organoid system that’s intrinsically decoupled from any sensory input or communication with organs gives you a window into what’s happening with this self-assembly process,” Sharf said. “That self-assembly process is really hard to do with traditional 2D cell culture—you can’t get the cell diversity and the architecture. The cells need to be in intimate contact with each other. We’re trying to control the initial conditions, so we can let biology do its wonderful thing.”</p>







<p>The Sharf lab is developing novel neural interfaces, leveraging expertise in physics, materials science, and electrical engineering. On the right, Koushik Devarajan, an electrical and computer engineering Ph.D. student in the Sharf lab.<br></p>



<h4 id="h-pattern-production"><strong>Pattern production</strong></h4>



<p>The researchers observed the electrical activity of the brain tissue as they self-assembled from stem cells into a tissue that can translate the senses and produce language and conscious thought. They found that within the first few months of development, long before the human brain is capable of receiving and processing complex external sensory information such as vision and hearing, its cells spontaneously began to emit electrical signals characteristic of the patterns that underlie translation of the senses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through decades of neuroscience research, the community has discovered that neurons fire in patterns that aren’t just random. Instead, the brain has a “default mode” — a basic underlying structure for firing neurons which then becomes more specific as the brain processes unique signals like a smell or taste. This background mode outlines the possible range of sensory responses the body and brain can produce.</p>



<p>In their observations of single neuron spikes in the self-assembling organoid models, Sharf and colleagues found that these earliest observable patterns have striking similarity with the brain’s default mode. Even without having received any sensory input, they are firing off a complex repertoire of time-based patterns, or sequences, which have the potential to be refined for specific senses, hinting at a genetically encoded blueprint inherent to the neural architecture of the living brain.</p>



<p>“These intrinsically self-organized systems could serve as a basis for constructing a representation of the world around us,” Sharf said. “The fact that we can see them in these early stages suggests that evolution has figured out a way that the central nervous system can construct a map that would allow us to navigate and interact with the world.”</p>



<p>Knowing that these organoids produce the basic structure of the living brain opens up a range of possibilities for better understanding human neurodevelopment, disease, and the effects of toxins in the brain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re showing that there is a basis for capturing complex dynamics that likely could be signatures of pathological onsets that we could study in human tissue,” Sharf said. “That would allow us to develop therapies, working with clinicians at the preclinical level to potentially develop compounds, drug therapies, and gene editing tools that could be cheaper, more efficient, higher throughput.”</p>



<p>This study included researchers at UC Santa Barbara, Washington University in St. Louis, Johns Hopkins University, the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, and ETH Zurich.</p>
