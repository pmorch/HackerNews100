<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <h2 id="user-content-what-happened"><a href="#what-happened">What happened?</a></h2>
<p>macOS Sonoma and macOS Ventura 13.6 were released with multiple serious bugs in their upgrade and boot process. Combined, these bugs can create conditions where a machine always boots to a black screen, no matter what power button press combination is used. This leaves users stuck, and the only solution is to use DFU recovery.</p>
<p>This situation can happen with certain settings on certain models, when multiple macOS versions are installed side by side (one Sonoma, one earlier). Since Asahi Linux behaves as if it were macOS 12.3/12.4/13.5 (depending on model and installation time), dual-boot installs of macOS Sonoma and Asahi Linux have the same effect. For macOS 13.6, this situation doesn't even require a dual-boot system, and can be triggered stand-alone as the only installed OS.</p>
<p><strong>We have updated the Asahi Linux installer to automatically perform an integrity check and diagnose your system on startup</strong>. To run it, paste this command into Terminal in macOS:</p>
<p><code>curl https://alx.sh | sh</code></p>
<p>You can quit the installer once you reach the main menu, without making any changes to your system.</p>
<p>Apple bug reports: FB13319681 and FB13319708</p>
<h2 id="user-content-what-are-the-bugs-exactly"><a href="#what-are-the-bugs-exactly">What are the bugs exactly</a></h2>
<p>There are two bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>macOS Sonoma upgrades use the previously installed version as System Recovery. This makes some sense, but does not consider backwards compatibility problems between older RecoveryOS and newer firmware. If this mismatch causes recoveryOS to fail to boot, this will leave System Recovery unusable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For 14" and 16" models: Once System Firmware is updated to the macOS Sonoma version, if the display is configured to a refresh rate other than ProMotion, that system will no longer be able to boot into older macOS installs nor Asahi Linux correctly. This includes recovery mode when those systems are set as the default boot OS, <strong>and also System Recovery</strong> at least until the next subsequent OS upgrade.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-what-happens-if-i-get-hit-by-the-bug-will-i-lose-data"><a href="#what-happens-if-i-get-hit-by-the-bug-will-i-lose-data">What happens if I get hit by the bug? Will I lose data?</a></h2>
<p>You will need another Mac to recover from the fault using DFU mode. However, you will <em>not</em> lose data.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-what-machines-are-affected"><a href="#what-machines-are-affected">What machines are affected?</a></h2>
<p>MacBook Pro models with ProMotion displays (14" and 16") are affected by the black screen boot bug.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-what-versions-are-affected"><a href="#what-versions-are-affected">What versions are affected?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>macOS Sonoma 14.0+ (not fixed as of 2023-10-31)</li>
<li>macOS Ventura 13.6+ (uses 14.0 firmware)</li>
<li>Possibly: macOS Monterey 12.7 (unconfirmed)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-what-should-i-do"><a href="#what-should-i-do">What should I do?</a></h2>
<h3 id="user-content-i-have-not-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-or-macos-ventura-136-yet-and-i-want-to"><a href="#i-have-not-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-or-macos-ventura-136-yet-and-i-want-to">I have not upgraded to macOS Sonoma (or macOS Ventura 13.6) yet and I want to</a></h3>
<p>We recommend waiting until these issues are fixed by Apple before upgrading. If you want to risk it and you have a 14" or 16" machine, <strong>make sure the display refresh rate is set to ProMotion</strong> before attempting the upgrade. You might still end up with a corrupted System Recovery, which can only be fixed with DFU mode or a subsequent successful upgrade.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you plan to install Asahi Linux or not, we recommend running the Asahi Linux installer after a Sonoma upgrade to check the status of your System Recovery partition. It will inform you about any issues prior to the main menu, before any changes are made to your system.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-i-have-not-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-or-macos-ventura-136-yet-and-im-in-no-rush"><a href="#i-have-not-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-or-macos-ventura-136-yet-and-im-in-no-rush">I have not upgraded to macOS Sonoma (or macOS Ventura 13.6) yet and I'm in no rush</a></h3>
<p>Feel free to stay on macOS version 13.5 or earlier for the time being. You can safely install Asahi Linux if you wish.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-i-have-already-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-and-i-want-to-install-asahi-linux"><a href="#i-have-already-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-and-i-want-to-install-asahi-linux">I have already upgraded to macOS Sonoma and I want to install Asahi Linux</a></h3>
<p>The Asahi Linux installer has been updated to check the version of your System Recovery, and will inform you of the risks if there is a mismatch. It will also check the ProMotion refresh rate, and refuse to install if it is set to anything other than ProMotion mode. Therefore, it is safe to install at this time.</p>
<p>Start the installation process normally. Follow the prompts carefully and read all the information printed. If your System Recovery version is mismatched, make sure you understand the risks. If your display refresh rate is incorrect, the installer will ask you to change it.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-i-have-already-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-and-i-have-asahi-linux"><a href="#i-have-already-upgraded-to-macos-sonoma-and-i-have-asahi-linux">I have already upgraded to macOS Sonoma and I have Asahi Linux</a></h3>
<p>If you are currently booted into macOS, ensure the display refresh rate is set to ProMotion (for 14" and 16" machines).</p>
<p>We recommend running the Asahi Linux installer again to verify the integrity of your System RecoveryOS partition and ProMotion status. If there is a problem, you should refrain from making any major changes to your system until the issue is fixed by Apple.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-i-am-affected-to-the-issue-what-do-i-do"><a href="#i-am-affected-to-the-issue-what-do-i-do">I am affected to the issue, what do I do?</a></h3>
<p>If your machine boots to a black screen (brief Apple logo, then nothing), first attempt a regular recoveryOS boot by fully powering down the machine, then holding down the power button.</p>
<p>If that does not work, try booting into System RecoveryOS. To do this, fully power down the machine, and then perform a fast "tap-and-hold" power button gesture (press and release once, then press and hold).</p>
<p>If that also leads to the same problem, unfortunately you will have to resort to DFU mode. See the following section for details.</p>
<p>If you can successfully reach a boot menu, select your macOS Sonoma install and hold down Option while confirming your selection to make it the default boot OS. <strong>If you have macOS 13.6 ventura instead, follow the special section below.</strong></p>
<h3 id="user-content-how-do-i-fix-my-machine-with-dfu-mode"><a href="#how-do-i-fix-my-machine-with-dfu-mode">How do I fix my machine with DFU mode?</a></h3>
<p>First, you will need another Mac running a recent version of macOS (an Intel Mac is OK). Install Apple Configurator from the App Store on the other Mac and open it.</p>
<p>Follow <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gu/guide/apple-configurator-mac/apdd5f3c75ad/mac" rel="nofollow">Apple's</a> instructions to connect your two machines together, and put your target machine in DFU mode. The target machine's display should remain off at this point.</p>
<p>You should see a large "DFU" icon in Apple Configurator. If you see anything else, the machine is not in the correct mode. Repeat the procedure and try again.</p>
<p>Once you see the DFU icon, right click it and select Advanced → Revive. This will begin the revive process.</p>
<p>If you get a message saying "A system update is required for this device", you can ignore it and press "Restore Anyway". This process has been tested with another Mac running macOS 13.5.</p>
<p>Follow the prompts and accept any accessory connection requests. Do not leave the machine unattended, as you might miss one of those prompts (and there is a timeout). The process will take a few minutes to complete.</p>
<p>Once the Revive process completes, the machine should boot into macOS Recovery. Follow the prompts and authenticate yourself.</p>
<p>After this, the machine will reboot into the Boot Picker.</p>
<p><strong>If you have macOS 13.6 ventura instead, follow the special section below.</strong></p>
<p>Select your macOS Sonoma install, then go into the Display settings page and set the display refresh rate to ProMotion. This will prevent the problem from reoccurring.</p>
<p>Should you wind up with a "black screen boot" again after this point, follow the steps in the previous section to perform the "tap-and-hold" power gesture. This should now work properly, as your System RecoveryOS has been updated. You may then select macOS again and fix the display refresh rate.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-i-dont-have-another-mac-to-use-dfu-mode-what-do-i-do"><a href="#i-dont-have-another-mac-to-use-dfu-mode-what-do-i-do">I don't have another Mac to use DFU mode! What do I do?</a></h3>
<p>You can take your Mac to the Apple Store and ask them to do a <strong>DFU Revive</strong>. Make sure they do <strong>not</strong> do a Restore, which would wipe all your data. They should perform this service for free. Do not let them charge you any money for it. This is a problem Apple caused, and purely a software issue. If the technicians claim there is hardware damage, they are wrong.</p>
<h3 id="user-content-what-if-i-have-macos-136-ventura-and-not-sonoma"><a href="#what-if-i-have-macos-136-ventura-and-not-sonoma">What if I have macOS 13.6 Ventura and not Sonoma?</a></h3>
<p>macOS 13.6 Ventura uses the macOS Sonoma System Firmware, but suffers from the problem. Even users with just 13.6 installed single-boot are affected by this issue (no Asahi Linux needed). We do not understand how Apple managed to release an OS update that, when upgraded to normally, leaves machines unbootable if their display refresh rate is not the default. This seems to have been a major QA oversight by Apple.</p>
<p>If your system has 13.6 Ventura and ended up in the black boot situation, unfortunately the only known solution is to upgrade to Sonoma. From the Boot Picker, select Settings. This will boot into recoveryOS. From there, select "Install macOS Sonoma". Follow the prompts and select your existing macOS volume. This will upgrade macOS without losing your data.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="article">
    <p>One of the biggest challenges for any software is to determine how changes impact user experience in the real world. Whether it’s the processing speed of video editing software or the smoothness of a browsing experience, there’s only so much you can tell from testing in a controlled lab environment. While local experiments can provide plenty of metrics, improvements to those metrics may not translate to a better user experience.</p>
<p>This can be especially challenging with complex client software running third-party code like Firefox, and it’s a big reason why we’ve undertaken the <a href="https://twitter.com/mozhacks/status/1603435347190419456">Speedometer 3 effort</a> alongside other web browsers. Our goal is to build performance tests that simulate real-world user experiences so that browsers have better tools to drive improvements for real users on real webpages. While it’s easy to see that benchmarks have improved in Firefox throughout the year as a result of this work, what we really care about is how much those wins are being felt by our users.</p>
<p>In order to measure the user experience, Firefox collects a wide range of anonymized timing metrics related to page load, responsiveness, startup and other aspects of browser performance. Collecting data while holding ourselves to the highest standards of privacy can be challenging. For example, because we rely on aggregated metrics, we lack the ability to pinpoint data from any particular website. But perhaps even more challenging is analyzing the data once collected and drawing actionable conclusions. In the future we’ll talk more about these challenges and how we’re addressing them, but in this post we’d like to share how some of the metrics that are fundamental to how our users experience the browser have improved throughout the year</p>
<p>Let’s start with page load. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First_contentful_paint">First Contentful Paint</a> (FCP) is a better metric for felt performance than the `onload` event. We’re tracking the time it takes between receiving the first byte from the network to FCP. This tells us how much faster we are giving feedback to the user that the page is successfully loading, so it’s a critical metric for understanding the user experience. While much of this is up to web pages themselves, if the browser improves performance across the board, we expect this number to go down.</p>
<div id="attachment_48049"><p><a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/FCPRUM.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48049" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/FCPRUM-500x215.png" alt="Graph of the median time between response start and first contentful paint, going from ~250 to ~215. Three distinct areas with a more pronounced slope are visible in mid february, late April and the largest in late July." width="500" height="215" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/FCPRUM-500x215.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/FCPRUM-250x107.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/FCPRUM-768x330.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/FCPRUM-1536x659.png 1536w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/FCPRUM.png 1670w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-48049">Image 1 – Median time from Response Start to First Contentful Paint in milliseconds</p></div>
<p>We can see that this time improved from roughly 250ms at the start of the year to 215ms in October. This means that a user receives feedback on page loads almost 15% faster than they did at the start of the year. And it’s important to note that this is all the result of optimization work that didn’t even explicitly target pageload.</p>
<p>In order to understand where this improvement is coming from, let’s look at another piece of timing data: the amount of time that was spent executing JavaScript code during a pageload. Here we are going to look at the 95th percentile, representing the most JS heavy pages and highlighting a big opportunity for us to remove friction for users..</p>
<div id="attachment_48050"><p><a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/JSPRUM.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48050" decoding="async" src="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/JSPRUM-500x215.png" alt="A graph of the 95th percentile of JS execution time during pageload. It runs from ~1560 in January 2023 to ~1260 by October 2023. In general it's a steady downward slope with a small downward jump in April and a large downward jump during August." width="500" height="215" srcset="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/JSPRUM-500x215.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/JSPRUM-250x107.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/JSPRUM-768x330.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/JSPRUM-1536x659.png 1536w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2023/10/JSPRUM.png 1670w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-48050">Image 2 – 95th Percentile of JS execution time during pageload in milliseconds</p></div>
<p>This shows the 95th percentile improving from ~1560ms at the beginning of the year, to ~1260ms in October. This represents a considerable improvement of 300ms, or almost 20%, and is likely responsible for a significant portion of the reduced FCP times. This makes sense, since Speedometer 3 work has led to significant optimizations to the <a href="https://spidermonkey.dev/">SpiderMonkey</a> JavaScript engine (a story for another post).</p>
<p>We’d also like to know how responsive pages are after they are loaded. For example, how smooth is the response when typing on the keyboard as I write this blogpost! The primary metric we collect here is the “keypress present latency”; the time between a key being pressed on the keyboard and its result being presented onto the screen. Rendering some text to the screen may sound simple, but there’s a lot going on to make that happen – especially when web pages run main thread JavaScript to respond to the keypress event. Most typing is snappy and primarily limited by hardware (e.g. the refresh rate of the monitor), but it’s extremely disruptive when it’s not. This means it’s important to mitigate the worst cases, so we’ll again look at the 95th percentile.</p>

<p>Once again we see a measurable improvement. The 95th percentile hovered around 65ms for most of the year and dropped to under 59ms after the Firefox 116 and 117 releases in August. A 10% improvement to the slowest keypresses means users are experiencing more instantaneous feedback and fewer disruptions while typing.</p>
<p>We’ve been motivated by the improvements we’re seeing in our telemetry data, and we’re convinced that our efforts this year are having a positive effect on Firefox users. We have many more optimizations in the pipeline and will share more details about those and our overall progress in future posts.</p>

        <div data-component-list="ModalGalleryTrigger">
             
                 <div>On Monday, October 30, at Apple’s Scary Fast special event unveiling the all-new MacBook Pro with the M3 family of chips and 24-inch iMac with M3, there was an unseen star of the show working behind the scenes. All of the presenters, locations, and drone footage in the event were filmed using iPhone 15 Pro Max, the preferred smartphone for creative pros and filmmakers. Led by documentary film director Brian Oakes, known for the award-winning <em>Jim: The James Foley Story </em>and<em> Living with Lincoln</em>, Scary Fast put iPhone 15 Pro Max right in the middle of the action.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The iPhone 15 Pro Max camera system offers the best video in a smartphone, with its quality rivaling those of professional video cameras. iPhone 15 Pro Max enables creatives to capture in ProRes up to 4K60 fps to an external drive with Apple Log encoding, which allows even more detail to be preserved for post-production color grading. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are also the first smartphones in the world to support the Academy Color Encoding System (ACES), a global standard for color workflows.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“We were able to get the same complex shots with iPhone 15 Pro Max,” says Oakes. “It’s amazing to see that the quality from a device that is so small and so portable can rival a large $20,000 camera.”
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The production was advised by Apple’s Jon Carr, a Pro Workflow video specialist whose credits include <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> and <em>Terminator: Dark Fate</em>, and Jeff Wozniak, who has worked on productions including <em>Transformers: Dark of the Moon</em>, <em>Avatar</em>, and <em>Iron Man 2</em>. “This year, iPhone 15 Pro Max was supercharged with the ability to record ProRes to an external drive, and Apple Log, our flavor of a format that all of the very high-end digital cameras shoot,” says Wozniak.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“It’s pretty amazing how you can put this in the hands of someone who’s a professional director and they don’t have to change their equipment — they don’t have to change any of the things that they always do,” adds Carr.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Capturing footage with multiple iPhone 15 Pro Max devices, the team utilized the integration between iPhone 15 Pro, the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-camera/id6449580241" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-analytics-exit-link="">Blackmagic Camera</a> app, and Tentacle Sync, showcasing the true power of the Apple ecosystem. Connected via Bluetooth, Tentacle Sync drives timecode and enables all devices on set — including Macs and preview screens — to be synced throughout the production. Beastgrip accessories, including cages and rigs, were also used during the production. &nbsp;

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="http://www.righto.com/2023/10/reverse-engineering-ethernet-backoff-on.html">http://www.righto.com/2023/10/reverse-engineering-ethernet-backoff-on.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38086894">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-6841874513404372481" itemprop="description articleBody"><p>
Introduced in 1973, Ethernet is the predominant way of wiring computers together.
Chips were soon introduced to handle the low-level aspects of Ethernet: converting data packets into bits,
implementing checksums, and handling network collisions.
In 1982, Intel announced the i82586 Ethernet LAN coprocessor chip, which went much further by offloading most of the
data movement from the main processor to an on-chip coprocessor.
Modern Ethernet networks handle a gigabit of data per second or more, but at the time, the Intel chip's support for 10 Mb/s
Ethernet put it on the cutting edge.
(Ethernet was surprisingly expensive, about $2000 at the time, but <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3kpkQKds0lAC&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">expected to drop</a> under $1000 with the Intel chip.)
In this blog post, I focus on a specific part of the coprocessor chip: how it handles network collisions and implements
exponential backoff.</p>
<p>The die photo below shows the i82586 chip. This photo shows the metal layer on top of the chip, which hides the underlying
polysilicon wiring and silicon transistors.
Around the edge of the chip, square bond pads provide the link to the chip's 48 external pins.
I have labeled the function blocks based on my reverse engineering and published descriptions. The left side of the chip is called the "receive unit" and
handles the low-level networking,
with circuitry for the network transmitter and receiver.
The left side also contains low-level control and status registers.
The right side is called the "command unit" and interfaces to memory and the main processor.
The right side contains a simple processor controlled by a microinstruction ROM.<span id="fnref:microcode"><a href="#fn:microcode">1</a></span>
Data is transmitted between the two halves of the chip by 16-byte FIFOs (first in, first out queues).</p>

Click this image (or any other) for a larger version.</p>
<p>The 82586 chip is more complex than the typical Ethernet chip at the time.
It was designed to improve system performance by moving most of the Ethernet processing from the main processor to
the coprocessor, allowing the main processor and the coprocessor to operate in parallel.
The coprocessor provides four DMA channels to move data between memory and the network without the main processor's involvement.
The main processor and the coprocessor communicate through complex data structures<span id="fnref:structures"><a href="#fn:structures">2</a></span> in shared memory: the main processor puts control blocks in memory
to tell the I/O coprocessor what to do, specifying the locations of transmit and receive buffers in memory.
In response, the I/O coprocessor puts status blocks in memory.
The processor onboard the 82586 chip allows the chip to handle these complex data structures in software.
Meanwhile, the transmission/receive circuitry on the left side of the chip uses dedicated circuitry to handle the low-level,
high-speed aspects of Ethernet. </p>

<p>A key problem with a shared network is how to prevent multiple computers from trying to send data on the network at the same
time.
Instead of a centralized control mechanism, Ethernet allows computers to transmit whenever they want.<span id="fnref:token-ring"><a href="#fn:token-ring">3</a></span>
If two computers transmit at the same time, the "collision" is detected and the computers try again, hoping to
avoid a collision the next time.
Although this may sound inefficient, it turns out to work out remarkably well.<span id="fnref:csma"><a href="#fn:csma">4</a></span>
To avoid a second collision, each computer waits a random amount of time before retransmitting the packet.
If a collision happens again (which is likely on a busy network), an exponential backoff algorithm is used, with each
computer waiting longer and longer after each collision.
This automatically balances the retransmission delay to minimize collisions and maximize throughput.</p>
<p>I traced out a bunch of circuitry to determine how the exponential backoff logic is implemented.
To summarize, exponential backoff is implemented with a 10-bit counter to provide a pseudorandom number, a 10-bit mask register to get an exponentially sized
delay, and a delay counter to count down the delay.
I'll discuss how these are implemented, starting with the 10-bit counter.</p>
<h2>The 10-bit counter</h2>
<p>A 10-bit counter may seem trivial, but it still takes up a substantial area of the chip.
The straightforward way of implementing a counter is to hook up 10 latches as a "ripple counter".
The counter is controlled by a clock signal that indicates that the counter should increment.
The clock toggles the lowest bit of the counter.
If this bit flips from 1 to 0, the next higher bit is toggled.
The process is repeated from bit to bit, toggling a bit if there is a carry.
The problem with this approach is that the carry "ripples" through the counter.
Each bit is delayed by the lower bit, so the bits don't all flip at the same time.
This limits the speed of the counter as the top bit isn't settled until the carry has propagated through the nine lower bits.</p>
<p>The counter in the chip uses a different approach with additional circuitry to improve performance.
Each bit has logic to check if all the lower bits are ones. If so, the clock signal toggles the bit.
All the bits toggle at the same time, rapidly incrementing the counter in response to the clock signals.
The drawback of this approach is that it requires much more logic.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows how the carry logic is implemented. 
The circuitry is optimized to balance speed and complexity.
In particular, bits are examined in groups of three, allowing some of the logic to be shared across multiple bits.
For instance, instead of using a 9-input gate to examine the nine lower bits, separate gates test bits 0-2 and 3-5.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/toggle-logic.jpg"><img alt="The circuitry to generate the toggle signals for each bit of the counter." height="555" src="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/toggle-logic-w350.jpg" title="The circuitry to generate the toggle signals for each bit of the counter." width="350"></a></p><p>The circuitry to generate the toggle signals for each bit of the counter.</p>
<p>The implementation of the latches is also interesting. 
Each latch is implemented with dynamic logic, using the circuit's capacitance to store each bit.
The input is connected to the output with two inverters.
When the clock is high, the transistor turns on, connecting the inverters in a loop that holds the value.
When the clock is low, the transistor turns off. However, the 0 or 1 value will still remain on the input to
the first inverter, held by the charge on the transistor's gate. 
At this time, an input can be fed into the latch, overriding the old value.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/bit.jpg"><img alt="The basic dynamic latch circuit." height="148" src="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/bit-w300.jpg" title="The basic dynamic latch circuit." width="300"></a></p><p>The basic dynamic latch circuit.</p>
<p>The latch has some additional circuitry to make it useful.
To toggle the latch, the output is inverted before feeding it back to the input. The toggle control signal selects
the inverted output through another pass transistor.
The toggle signal is only activated when the clock is low, ensuring that the
circuit doesn't repeatedly toggle, oscillating out of control.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/counter-bit.jpg"><img alt="One bit of the counter." height="196" src="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/counter-bit-w400.jpg" title="One bit of the counter." width="400"></a></p><p>One bit of the counter.</p>
<p>The image below shows how the counter circuit is implemented on the die. I have removed the metal layer to show the underlying transistors; the circles are contacts where the metal was connected to the underlying silicon.
The pinkish regions are doped silicon. The pink-gray lines are polysilicon wiring. When polysilicon crosses doped silicon, it
creates a transistor.
The blue color swirls are not significant; they are bits of oxide remaining on the die.</p>

<h2>The 10-bit mask register</h2>
<p>The mask register has a particular number of low bits set, providing a mask of length 0 to 10.
For instance, with 4 bits set, the mask register is 0000001111.
The mask register can be updated in two ways. First, it can be set to length 1-8 with a three-bit length input.<span id="fnref:length"><a href="#fn:length">5</a></span>
Second, the mask can be lengthened by one bit, for example going from 0000001111 to 0000011111 (length 4 to 5).</p>
<p>The mask register is implemented with dynamic latches similar to the counter, but the inputs to the latches are different.
To load the mask to a particular length, each bit has logic to determine if the bit should be set based on the three-bit input.
For example, bit 3 is cleared if the specified length is 0 to 3, and set otherwise.
The lengthening feature is implemented by shifting the mask value to the left by one bit and inserting a 1 into the lowest bit.</p>
<p>The schematic below shows one bit of the mask register. At the center is a two-inverter latch as seen before.
When the clock is high, it holds its value. When the clock is low, the latch can be loaded with a new value.
The "shift" line causes the bit from the previous stage to be shifted in. The "load" line loads the mask bit generated from
the input length. The "reset" line clears the mask.
At the right is the NAND gate that applies the mask to the count and inverts the result.
As will be seen below, these NAND gates are unusually large.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/mask-stage.png"><img alt="One stage of the mask register." height="259" src="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/mask-stage-w500.png" title="One stage of the mask register." width="500"></a></p><p>One stage of the mask register.</p>
<p>The logic to set a mask bit based on the length input is shown below.<span id="fnref:demorgan"><a href="#fn:demorgan">6</a></span>
The three-bit "sel" input selects the mask length from 1 to 8 bits; note that the mask0 bit is always set while bits
8 and 9 are cleared.<span id="fnref:control"><a href="#fn:control">7</a></span>
Each set of gates energizes the corresponding mask line for the appropriate inputs.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/mask-ctrl.png"><img alt="The control logic to enable mask bits based on length." height="602" src="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/mask-ctrl-w350.png" title="The control logic to enable mask bits based on length." width="350"></a></p><p>The control logic to enable mask bits based on length.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the mask register on the die. I removed the metal layer to show the underlying
silicon and polysilicon, so the transistors are visible.
On the left are the NAND gates that combine each bit of the counter with the mask. Note that large snake-like
transistors; these larger transistors provide enough current to drive the signal over the long bus to
the delay counter register at the bottom of the chip.
Bit 0 of the mask is always set, so it doesn't have a latch. Bits 8 and 9 of the mask are only set by
shifting, not by selecting a mask length, so they don't have mask logic.<span id="fnref:state"><a href="#fn:state">8</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/mask-register.jpg"><img alt="The mask register on the die." height="764" src="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/mask-register-w400.jpg" title="The mask register on the die." width="400"></a></p><p>The mask register on the die.</p>
<h2>The delay counter register</h2>
<p>To generate the pseudorandom exponential backoff, the counter register and the mask register are NANDed together.
This generates a number of the desired binary length, which is stored in the delay counter.
Note that the NAND operation inverts the result, making it negative.
Thus, as the delay counter counts up, it counts toward zero, reaching zero after the desired number of clock ticks.</p>
<p>The implementation of the delay counter is similar to the first counter, so I won't include a schematic.
However, the delay counter is attached to the register bus, allowing its value to be read by the chip's CPU.
Control lines allow the delay counter's value to pass onto the register bus.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the locations of the counter, mask, and delay register on the die.
In this era, something as simple as a 10-bit register occupied a significant part of the die.
Also note the distance between the counter and mask and the delay register at the bottom of the chip.
The NAND gates for the counter and mask required large transistors to drive the signal across this large distance.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/die-labeled-backoff.jpg"><img alt="The die, with counter, mask, and delay register." height="446" src="https://static.righto.com/images/i82586s/die-labeled-backoff-w600.jpg" title="The die, with counter, mask, and delay register." width="600"></a></p><p>The die, with counter, mask, and delay register.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The Intel Ethernet chip provides an interesting example of how a real-world circuit is implemented on a chip.
Exponential backoff is a key part of the Ethernet standard.
This chip implements backoff with a simple but optimized circuit.<span id="fnref:drawback"><a href="#fn:drawback">9</a></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p id="region-abstract">
<h2>If you work from home in California, your employer might be required to contribute to your internet bill, electricity bill, and other expenses necessary to do your job.</h2>
</p><div id="region-content">
<p><a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/legal-issues-to-consider-when-transitioning-to-a-remote-workforce.html">Remote work</a> has well-recognized benefits (no commute) and drawbacks (disappearing boundaries between personal and professional life), but one little-commented side effect of the "WFH" lifestyle is the cost associated with being at home throughout the work week.</p>
<p>From skyrocketing utility payments to additional costs for phone and internet use, many remote workers are now shouldering the expenses that their employers used to pay. But are employees really responsible for expenses incurred while working from home?</p>
<p>In California, at least, the answer is no. California is one of about <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/can-employees-get-reimbursed-for-work-at-home-expenses-incurred-due-to-covid-19.html">two dozen states with laws requiring employer reimbursement</a> of employee work expenses—and one of only a few states to make clear that those laws apply to remote work. (Cal. Lab. Code § 2802 (2022).)</p>
<p>In fact, 2022 saw a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-04-07/covid-work-from-home-lawsuits-pandemic-business-expenses-litigation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">spate of California lawsuits</a> by remote workers demanding reimbursement from large employers such as Amazon, Visa, and Bank of America for work-from-home expenses incurred during the pandemic.</p>
<p>As these lawsuits continue to make their way through the courts, the question for California workers remains: Which of your WFH expenses must be reimbursed by your employer?</p>
<h2>California Employers Must Reimburse You for Any "Necessary" Expenses</h2>
<p>Under California law, your employer must reimburse you for any "necessary" expenses incurred while you're working from home.</p>
<h3>What Are "Necessary" Expenses?</h3>
<p>Expenses are considered "necessary" if they're required for you to do your job. This is true whether you're working in the office (or other worksite) or working remotely.</p>
<p>For example, if your job involves scientific research, then it might be necessary for you to pay for a subscription to an online science journal; your employer would have to reimburse you for that expense. If, on the other hand, you feel you are a more effective leader if you stay abreast of developing news, but doing so is not part of your job duties, then subscriptions to various newspapers are not "necessary" for you to do your job and would not be reimbursable.</p>
<p>California courts have also found that when it comes to monthly expenses such as cell phone or internet bills, "necessary" expenses generally include a "reasonable percentage" of such costs.</p>
<p>For example, one court found that when an employee had to use his personal cell phone to make work calls, his employer was required to reimburse him for a portion of his phone bill even though the employee did not incur any additional expenses because he had an unlimited data plan. The court found that any other interpretation would result in an unfair windfall to the employer.</p>
<p>While the determination of whether an expense is "necessary" varies depending on the circumstances of a particular case, generally speaking, California employees who <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/workplace-surveillance-while-working-from-home.html">work from home</a> are likely entitled to reimbursement for the following expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reasonable percentage of their internet bill</li>
<li>a reasonable percentage of their mobile phone bill</li>
<li>a work computer, a printer, and other necessary equipment (however, home office equipment purchased by an employer likely belongs to the employer, and must be returned if the employee leaves the company)</li>
<li>necessary online subscriptions, such as a paid plan for remote meeting software</li>
<li>travel expenses, and</li>
<li>attorney fees incurred to recover expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the law regarding these expenses is not yet decided, remote California workers <em>may</em> also be entitled to reimbursement for:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reasonable percentage of electricity costs, and</li>
<li>the cost of dedicated home office space (reimbursement is more likely if the employee was renting or had plans to rent the space to a third party prior to beginning remote work). (Cal. Lab. Code § 2802 (2022).)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What If You're Working From Home Voluntarily?</h3>
<p>Employers and courts are more likely to find that expenses incurred while working from home are "necessary" if remote work is required or encouraged by your employer.</p>
<p>However, if your organization has returned to in-person work, but you choose to work from home, it's less likely that your business expenses will be seen as "necessary"—as you could have avoided them by working from the office or other worksite.</p>
<h2>You're Entitled to Reimbursement If Your Employer Knew or Should Have Known About the Expenses</h2>
<p>While many employers require you to submit expense reports or other paperwork in order to be reimbursed, California courts have held that reimbursement requests aren't necessary if your employer has reason to know about the expenses you're incurring.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://casetext.com/case/williams-v-amazoncom-servs" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Williams v. Amazon</em></a>, a high-profile case arising from the pandemic, a California software development engineer alleged that Amazon failed to properly reimburse its employees for expenses incurred while they were working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic (2022).</p>
<p>Amazon filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit, arguing that it didn't have to reimburse its employee's expenses because he hadn't submitted reimbursement requests.</p>
<p>But in June 2022, the court denied Amazon's motion to dismiss, finding that Amazon knew or should have known that its employees who work from home incurred basic costs related to remote work—including expenses related to internet, electricity, and physical space.</p>
<p>In overruling Amazon's motion to dismiss, the court found that the lawsuit could move forward, although it has not yet decided the ultimate question of whether Amazon must actually reimburse employees for their WFH expenses.</p>
<h2>Contact an Employment Attorney</h2>
<p>If your employer has failed to reimburse you for expenses you incurred while working from home, consider raising the issue with your employer. Because many companies are still adjusting to the "new normal" of remote work, they might be unaware of their legal obligation to reimburse employees for necessary expenses. For that reason, it might be helpful to refer your employer to the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=2802.&amp;lawCode=LAB" rel="noopener" target="_blank">relevant law</a>. </p>
<p>If your employer refuses to meet its legal requirements, it might be worth contacting an employment attorney to discuss your legal options.</p>

They settled the nearby <em>Isle de France</em> in 1715. By 1793, a French coconut plantation housed the first permanent settlement on the archipelago's largest island, <em>Diego Garcia</em>.</p><p>This being an 18th Century European settlement, <em>of course</em> it was built on the backs of slaves. The colony was French, but <a href="https://www.refworld.org/docid/49749ce6c.html?ref=beep.blog">the people were Malagasy and Mozambican</a>.</p><p>After Napoleon's defeat in 1814, <a href="http://www.govmu.org/English/ExploreMauritius/Pages/History.aspx?ref=beep.blog#british">the French ceded <em>Isle de France</em> and its dependencies to Britain</a>. Britain reinstated the isle's Dutch name – <em>Mauritius</em> – and continued to govern the archipelago and its plantations from there.</p><p>After the abolition of slavery in 1835, many now-freemen chose to stay on the archipelago and were joined by labourers from India. Beautiful people being beautiful people, they were fruitful and multiplied. New families made the archipelago their home, and <a href="http://www.chagosislandersmovement.com/ourhistory/?ref=beep.blog">an integrated Chagossian society blossomed for generations</a>. By the 1960's, the archipelago was home to some 2,000 people. </p><p>In the incredible documentary "<a href="https://vimeo.com/17401157?ref=beep.blog">Stealing a Nation</a>", journalist John Pilger asked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlesia_Alexis?ref=beep.blog">Charlesia Alexis</a> about her fondest memories of Diego Garcia: </p><blockquote>"We could eat and drink everything, we never lacked for anything. And we never bought anything, except for the clothes we wore."</blockquote><p>In that same documentary, Rita Élysée Bancoult reminisced:</p><blockquote>"I had dogs which I brought to the beach with me. At low tide they would go out and catch fish and bring them in and lay them at my feet."</blockquote><p>While the islanders relied on their governing island Mauritius for trade and medical treatment, they were largely and comfortably self-sufficient. Life was, by their own accounts, good.</p><h2 id="conspiracy">Conspiracy</h2><p>The end of World War II in 1945 led to the start of the Cold War. Soviet influence grew across Europe and Asia, and the United States of America sought to expand too. </p><p>And she had just the spot in mind.</p><p>No matter where in the world the next inevitable war was to break out, those idyllic coral islands smack in the centre of the Indian Ocean would be <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2020/06/americas-interest-in-diego-garcia/?ref=beep.blog">the perfect staging platform</a> for attacks against a dozen countries' supply lines, communication hubs and military targets.</p><p>But how could the United States acquire the archipelago? The land was Mauritian territory, and – even though Mauritius was a British territory -- Britain had no claim over the islands. No matter what the United States' offered her war-time ally, the land wasn't legally Britain's to trade.</p><p>And so, Britain traded the land <em>illegally</em>.</p><p>On November 8th, 1965, the British Foreign Office redrew the map. Public servants in London created, on paper, a new British territory -- the <strong><a href="https://biot.gov.io/?ref=beep.blog">British Indian Ocean Territory</a></strong> &nbsp;-- which encompassed the Chagos Archipelago, then transferred governance of the islands from Mauritius directly to London.</p><p>By the Foreign Office's reckoning, the islands were now British. And in exchange for a $14 million discount on a nuclear missile, the British Indian Ocean Territory was leased to the United States of America.</p><p>But what about the Chagossian people living on those islands?</p><h2 id="terror">Terror</h2><p>The American military-industrial complex was not amenable to sharing the islands.</p><p>The people were removed; first by terror, then deceit, then force.</p><p>Robin Mardemootoo, lawyer for the Chagos Islanders, explained the opening strike against the people:</p><blockquote>The British and American authorities implemented a policy decision that was aimed at depriving that community -- in the Chagos -- from basic supplies. No milk, no dairy products, no oil, no sugar, no salt, no medication, no more of the things you use in life.</blockquote><p>When the blockade didn't scare enough Chagossians away, Sir Bruce Greatbatch -- <em>Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, Member of the Order of the British Empire, Governor of the Seychelles and interim administrator of the British Indian Ocean Territory</em> -- ordered all the dogs on Diego Garcia to be killed.</p><p>Almost a thousand pets and hunting animals were rounded up and gassed with the exhaust fumes of American military vehicles. The people were threatened with the same if they didn't leave.</p><p>When terror didn't work, Britain resorted to deceit. Islanders who left the archipelago were denied return. Many, like Charlesia Alexis, had no idea when travelling to Mauritius for medical treatment that they'd never see their homes again.</p><p>And finally, when terror and deceit hadn't been enough, the islanders were removed by force.</p><h2 id="exile">Exile</h2><p>At 1pm on <a href="https://shipstamps.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6422&amp;ref=beep.blog">October 15th, 1971</a>, the remaining people of Diego Garcia were summoned to the office of Sir Greatbatch's magistrate, John Rawling Todd. They were told they were to be loaded onto the cargo ship <em>MV Nordvær</em> and immediately expelled from their homeland. </p><p>They were allowed one suitcase each. Anything of cultural, emotional or financial value that they couldn't carry had to be abandoned. Sir Greatbatch demanded that the horses ride on-deck, while each family was permitted one mattress and forced to sleep on the ship's cargo of bird shit.</p><p>In an instant, not having bank accounts or currency of significant value, the Chagossians were poverty-stricken; no farms, no ocean to fish, no money, no homes.</p><p>The <em>Nordvær</em> sailed to the Seychelles, where the Chagossians were marched uphill to a prison and held until passage to Port Louis, Mauritius, was arranged. Then, at Port Louis, they were dumped and abandoned on the docks.</p><p>Cassam Uteem, former President of Mauritius, recalls:</p><blockquote>Some of them stayed on the docks, waiting for the next ship to take them back home. There was never to be a ship to take them back home.</blockquote><p>Eventually, they were taken to the derelict <em>Estate Beau Marchand</em> housing estate. They were given no water, no electricity, no doors, and no windows.</p><p>Many of the islanders died; of poverty and -- in their own words -- of "sadness".</p><p>Of heartbreak, despair, and suicide.</p><p>Those who lived couldn't afford to pay for funerals.</p><p>By the end of 1975, the expulsion and exile of the Chagossian people was complete. A survey showed 26 families had died together in poverty. Young girls were forced into prostitution to survive. 9 people committed suicide. And Mauritanian slums are still prisons to Chagossians today.</p><p>This was nothing less than ethnic cleansing.</p><h3 id="the-war-machine">The war machine</h3><p>Today, the archipelago's two-thousand Chagossians have been replaced by two-thousand military personnel.</p><p><em><a href="https://cnrj.cnic.navy.mil/Installations/NSF-Diego-Garcia/?ref=beep.blog">Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia</a></em> is owned by the British Ministry of Defence, leased to the United States Navy, and operated together.</p><p>"One Island, One Team, One Mission," they say.</p><p>Nearly 4 km of Diego was paved into a <a href="https://www.naval-technology.com/projects/diego-garcia/?ref=beep.blog">runway</a> where American bombers have launched attacks on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_invasion_of_Kuwait?ref=beep.blog">Iraq</a> and Afghanistan. There are piers and warehouses to support aircraft, ships and submarines. The island even hosts a satellite tracking station code-named "<a href="https://wikimapia.org/6799412/Diego-Garcia-Tracking-Station-REEF?ref=beep.blog">REEF</a>". </p><p>How the fuck did they get away with this?</p><h2 id="they-knew-it-was-illegal">They knew it was illegal</h2><p>From the very beginning of the conspiracy to expel the Chagossians, the British and United States authorities knew it was illegal.</p><p>They anticipated several challenges, two of which were:</p><ol><li>The detachment of colonial territory.</li><li>The United Nation's "sacred trust".</li></ol><p>First, the detachment of colonial territory. <a href="https://undocs.org/A/Res/1514(XV)?ref=beep.blog">United Nations Resolution 1514 (XV)</a> states that:</p><blockquote>[...] any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.</blockquote><p>In other words, in the opinion of the United Nations General Assembly and recorded in <a href="https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/2066(XX)?ref=beep.blog">Resolution 2066</a> in 1965, Britain broke international law when she detached the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritanian territory and reassigned it to British Indian Ocean Territory. </p><p>Mauritius did not, at the time, have independent legislative or executive power. Without the power of free and genuine expression, <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/ga12146.doc.htm?ref=beep.blog">the consent of the people could not have been queried or known</a>.</p><h2 id="sacred-trust">Sacred Trust</h2><p>The second legal challenge concerned the United Nations' "sacred trust".</p><p><a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-11?ref=beep.blog">Chapter XI of the UN Charter</a> requires member states to recognise that "the interests of the inhabitants of [their] territories are paramount" and to accept a "<a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/non-self-governing-week?ref=beep.blog">sacred trust</a>" to promote their peoples' well-being.</p><p>It goes without saying, the forced expulsion of the British citizens of the Chagos Islands from their homelands into abject poverty <em>utterly</em> violated international law.</p><p>Britain's defence was to claim -- to <em>lie</em> -- that the Chagos Archipelago was uninhabited when it was transferred into British Indian Ocean Territory administration. Now that British Foreign Office memoranda of the time are on the public record, we can see the lie for ourselves.</p><p>Foreign Office memorandum, July 1965, records:</p><blockquote>People were born there, and in some cases their parents were born there too. The intention is, however, that none of them should be regarded as being permanent inhabitants of the islands. [...] The legal position of the inhabitants would be greatly simplified from our point of view, though not necessarily from theirs, if we decided to treat them as a floating population.</blockquote><p>By "floating population", the Foreign Office meant to convince the world that the Chagossians were contract workers temporarily living on the island for employment, with no claim that the islands are their homeland.</p><p>Another Foreign Office memorandum, in November 1965, reinforced the lie and Britain's lack of concern for UN condemnation:</p><blockquote>There is a civilian population. In practice, however, I would advice a policy of "quiet disregard" -- in other words, let's forget about this one until the United Nations challenge us on it.</blockquote><h2 id="they-tried">They tried</h2><p>The United Nations -- and others -- <em>did</em> challenge Britain. Repeatedly.</p><p>In 2019, the International Court of Justice ruled that <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/ga12146.doc.htm?ref=beep.blog">the UK's occupation of the Chagos Islands is unlawful</a>. The UN passed <a href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3802539?ref=beep.blog">Resolution A/73/L.84</a> to demand that the United Kingdom unconditionally withdraw its administration from the area within six months </p><p>In 2000, the United Kingdom's own High Court ruled that <a href="https://www.equaltimes.org/will-the-uk-ever-let-chagos?ref=beep.blog#.YVrVbPco_d4">Britain should allow the Chagossians to return home</a>.</p><p>In 2021, <a href="https://www.itlos.org/en/main/cases/list-of-cases/dispute-concerning-delimitation-of-the-maritime-boundary-between-mauritius-and-maldives-in-the-indian-ocean-mauritius/maldives/?ref=beep.blog">Case #28</a> of <em>the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea</em> <a href="https://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/preliminary/mus_2021_preliminaryinfo.pdf?ref=beep.blog">ruled</a>: </p><blockquote>[...] it is inconceivable that the United Kingdom, whose administration over the Chagos Archipelago constitutes a wrongful act of a continuing character and thus must be brought to an end as rapidly as possible, and yet who has failed to do so, can have any legal interests in permanently disposing of maritime zones around the Chagos Archipelago by delimitation.</blockquote><p>And:</p><blockquote>It follows that, despite the United Kingdom's ongoing and unlawful colonial administration of the Chagos Archipelago, there can be no doubt that the Chagos Archipelago forms an integral part of the territory of the Republic of Mauritius and that there is no dispute with the United Kingdom as regards sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago.</blockquote><h2 id="it-never-ends">It never ends</h2><p>So, with all these rulings, what was Britain to do?</p><p>Terminate the United States' lease on the islands and tear down the base?</p><p>What do <em>you</em> think?</p><p>Britain's response was to designate the territory a nature reserve -- <a href="https://www.zsl.org/regions/uk-overseas-territories/chagos-archipelago?ref=beep.blog"><em>the Chagos Marine Protected Area</em></a> -- to be protected from human habitation.</p><p>But now, is it really fair of me to imply that the creation of the <em>Chagos Marine Protected Area</em> was just a disgusting ploy to prevent the Chagossians returning home? Couldn't it just be a rare and genuine political effort to save a natural environment?</p><p>We <em>could</em> believe that, if not for Wikileaks.</p><p>On May 15th, 2009, a <a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09LONDON1156_a.html?ref=beep.blog">cable</a> intercepted from Britain described the then-proposed reserve:</p><blockquote>[Her Majesty's Government] would like to establish a "marine park" or "reserve" providing comprehensive environmental protection to the reefs and waters of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), a senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) official informed Polcouns on May 12. [...]<p>He said that the BIOT's former inhabitants would find it difficult, if not impossible, to pursue their claim for resettlement on the islands if the entire Chagos Archipelago were a marine reserve.</p></blockquote><p>Colin Roberts, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Director of Overseas Territories, is quoted:</p><blockquote>[...] according to [Her Majesty's Government's] current thinking on a reserve, there would be "no human footprints" or "Man Fridays" on the BIOT's uninhabited islands. He asserted that establishing a marine park would, in effect, put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago's former residents.<p>Responding to Polcouns' observation that the advocates of Chagossian resettlement continue to vigorously press their case, Roberts opined that the UK's "environmental lobby is far more powerful than the Chagossians' advocates."</p></blockquote><p>And if the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's disdain for the Chagossian people wasn't obvious enough:</p><blockquote>Roberts emphasized. "We do not regret the removal of the population," since removal was necessary for the BIOT to fulfill its strategic purpose, he said. Removal of the population is the reason that the BIOT's uninhabited islands and the surrounding waters are in "pristine" condition.</blockquote><p>The cable ends with:</p><blockquote>Establishing a marine reserve might, indeed, as the FCO's Roberts stated, be the most effective long-term way to prevent any of the Chagos Islands' former inhabitants or their descendants from resettling in the BIOT.</blockquote><p>Angry, yet? Let's start talking about what you can do. Or, stop doing.</p><p>The <em><a href="https://www.iso.org/?ref=beep.blog">International Organization for Standardization</a></em> (ISO) is an international, non-governmental organisation that develops and describes shared understandings of our world. </p><p>Standard <em>ISO 9660</em>, for example, describes the structure of CD-ROM disks. <em>ISO 8601</em> describes date and time representation. And since 1974, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166?ref=beep.blog#Editions">ISO 3166</a></em> has described an ever-growing set of two-character codes to represent the countries and territories of the world.</p><p>The United States of America, for example, was assigned <code>"US"</code>. Britain got <code>"GB"</code>. And the British Indian Ocean Territory was given <code><a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/?ref=beep.blog#iso:code:3166:IO">"IO"</a></code>. </p><p>In March 1994, the Internet was young but growing fast. There were only seven top-level domains available back then -- <code>.com</code>, <code>.org</code>. <code>.net</code>, <code>.int</code>, <code>.edu</code>, <code>.gov</code> and <code>.mil</code> -- and the webizens of the information superhighway hungered for more variety.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1591.txt?ref=beep.blog">RFC 1591</a>, Jon Postel proposed the addition of <em>country code</em> top-level domains, which would use ISO 3166 as a basis and would allow governments to use and monetise as they wished.</p><p>The proposal came to pass. The United States of America was given the power to sell and profit from <code>".us"</code> domains. Britain was given <code>".uk"</code> domains. And she got her stolen territory's <code>".io"</code> domains, too.</p><p>And so, finally, I reach my point.</p><p>Every <code>.io</code> domain you buy funds a government committing <a href="https://www.scottishlegal.com/article/edinburgh-meeting-hears-britain-s-refusal-to-allow-chagos-islanders-to-return-home-is-crime-against-humanity?ref=beep.blog">crimes against humanity</a>. Every <code>.io</code> domain you renew legitimises and reinforces the continued exile of the Chagossians.</p><h2 id="what-happens-now">What happens now?</h2><p>I've got nothing but sympathy for folks who bought a <code>.io</code> domain in good faith before they learned about the criminality behind it.</p><p>In fact, in a way, the last thing I want is to tarnish the <code>.io</code> domain.</p><p>There's a lot to be done before this wrong has been righted, but a part of that has <em>got</em> to be the redirection of profits from <code>.io</code> sales and renewals from the British government to the Chagossian people. And then, if the Chagossian people are amenable to global sales of <code>.io</code> domains, for the name to enjoy a second renaissance and financially support the right people.</p><p>My dreams are naive, sure.</p><p>For my part, I'm working on migrating all my email from <code>@cariad.io</code> to <code>@cariad.earth</code>. It's a pain, but it's worth it.</p><p>If you're able to, I implore you to stop buying and renewing <code>.io</code> domains. Next time you're asked to vote, find out how your candidates feel about the exile of the Chagossians. Read what <a href="https://thechagosrefugeesgroup.com/?ref=beep.blog">The Chagos Refugees Group</a> has to say.</p><p>And for fuck's sake, look out for your fellow human beings.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/100663-windows-11-extends-support-archive-formats-thanks-open.html">https://www.techspot.com/news/100663-windows-11-extends-support-archive-formats-thanks-open.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38084314">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>TechSpot is celebrating its 25th anniversary. TechSpot means tech analysis and advice <a href="https://www.techspot.com/ethics.html" target="_blank">you&nbsp;can&nbsp;trust</a>.</p><div>
<p id="why-it-matters"><strong>Better late than never:</strong> Microsoft finally introduced native support for RAR archives earlier this year, just three decades after the format's official introduction in 1993. Windows 11 development is now progressing at an accelerated pace, therefore support for a whole lot of new (ancient) archive formats is coming soon. </p>
<p>Windows 11 users can now <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/98830-windows-finally-adds-native-support-rar-files.html">manage RAR archives natively</a>, with no need for third-party software or questionable archive "unpackers." Windows 11 22H2, the past year's last major release of the operating system (distributed on September 20, 2022), will soon become even more proficient in managing different kinds of archive files and formats.</p>
<p>Microsoft recently released <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/october-26-2023-kb5031455-os-build-22621-2506-preview-6513c5ec-c5a2-4aaf-97f5-44c13d29e0d4">KB5031455</a>, an optional, feature-rich preview cumulative update for Windows 11, refreshing the list of archive formats natively supported in the OS. Windows 11 22H2 and later versions can now manage files compressed in the following archive types: .rar, .7z, .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .tar.zst, .tar.xz, .tgz, .tbz2, .tzst, .txz. Support for password-encrypted archives is not available yet.</p>
<p>Redmond programmers added support for the aforementioned archive files thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive">libarchive library</a>, an open source project designed to develop a portable, efficient C library that can "read and write streaming archives" in a variety of formats. Libarchive supports additional archive types (Lzh, Xar) that could eventually come to Windows 11 as well.</p>

<p>Being an optional, non-mandatory update, the KB5031455 patch needs to be installed manually by going through the Windows Update settings page on Windows 11 and searching for newly released updates. If everything goes well with "early testers," the update's contents should eventually come to the majority of Windows users through the next batch of cumulative patches scheduled for November's 2023 Patch Tuesday.</p>
<p>The ability to support additional archive types (besides RAR and Zip) was hinted at by Panos Panay, who talked about the upcoming feature in one of his <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/23/bringing-the-power-of-ai-to-windows-11-unlocking-a-new-era-of-productivity-for-customers-and-developers-with-windows-copilot-and-dev-home/">Build blog posts</a> before he departed Microsoft. Windows 11 users can now get improved performance of archive functionality during compression, Panay said in May 2023.</p>
<p>Extended file type support is part of the Moment 4 package, a new feature update for Windows 11 that provides 72 new features and improvements to the cloud/AI-centric OS. KB5031455 features include the "centralized AI assistance" for Windows known as Copilot, an overhauled File Explorer "experience," a new Microsoft Backup app, a built-in Passkey Manager, and much more. Meanwhile, Windows 10 users can keep using trustworthy third-party archive managers like WinRAR for the foreseeable future.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>Let me introduce you to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordStar" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WordStar 4.0</a>, a popular word processor from the early 80s.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://josem.co/images/wordstar.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://josem.co/images/wordstar.jpg" alt="Wordstar 4.0" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="762"></picture>
<em>WordStar 4.0</em></p><p>As old as it seems, George R.R. Martin used it to write “A Song of Ice and Fire”.</p><p>Why would someone use such an old piece of software to write over 5,000 pages? I love how he puts it:</p><blockquote>It does everything I want a word processing program to do and it doesn't do anything else. I don't want any help. I hate some of these modern systems where you type up a lowercase letter and it becomes a capital. I don't want a capital, if I'd wanted a capital, I would have typed the capital.<cite><a href="#rf1">George R.R. Martin</a></cite></blockquote><p>This program embodies the concept of finished software — a software you can use forever with no unneeded changes.</p><p>Finished software is software that’s not expected to change, and that’s a feature! You can rely on it to do some real work.</p><p>Once you get used to the software, once the software works for you, you don’t need to learn anything new; the interface will exactly be the same, and all your files will stay relevant. No migrations, no new payments, no new changes.</p><p>This kind of software can be created intentionally, with a compromise from the creators that they won’t bother you with things you don’t need, and only the absolutely necessary will change, like minor updates to make it compatible with new operating systems.</p><p>Sometimes, finished software happens accidentally; maybe the company behind it has disappeared, or the product has been abandoned.</p><p>There are also some great examples in the UNIX world of finished software: commands like <code>cd</code>(to change the current directory) or <code>ls</code>(to list what’s there) won’t ever change in a significant way. You can rely on them until the end of your career.</p><h2 id="the-seduction-of-constant-updates">The seduction of constant updates</h2><p>Our expectations for software are different from other products we use in our daily lives.</p><p>When we buy a physical product, we accept that it won’t change in its lifetime. We’ll use it until it wears off, and we replace it. We can rely on that product not evolving; the gas pedal in my car will always be in the same place.</p><p>However, when it comes to software, we usually have the ingrained expectations of perpetual updates. We believe that if software doesn’t evolve it’ll be boring, old and unusable. If we see an app with no updates in the last year, we think the creator might be dead.</p><p>We also expect new versions of any software will be better than the previous ones. Once it’s released, most of our problems will be solved! What a deceiving lie.</p><p>Sometimes, a software upgrade is a step backward: less usable, less stable, with new bugs. Even if it’s genuinely better, there’s the learning curve. You were efficient with the old version, but now your most used button is on the other side of the screen under a hidden menu.</p><h2 id="finished-software-is-a-good-reminder">Finished software is a good reminder</h2><p>In a world where constant change is the norm, finished software provides a breath of fresh air. It’s a reminder that reliability, consistency, and user satisfaction can coexist in the realm of software development.</p><p>So the next time you find yourself yearning for the latest update, remember that sometimes, the best software is the one that doesn’t change at all.</p><hr><h3 id="references">References</h3><p><span id="rf1">[1] George R.R.

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-introduction" dir="auto"><a href="#introduction"></a><a id="user-content-1"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p dir="auto">Usually, our applications operate with the current state of a domain object.
But sometimes, we need to know the entire history of the domain object changes.
For example, we want to know how an order got into its current state.</p>
<p dir="auto">The audit trail (also called the audit log) is a chronological record of the history
and details of the actions that affected the system.
An audit trail may be a regulatory or business requirement.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can store all changes to the domain object state as a sequence of events in an append-only event stream.
Thus, event streams will contain an entire history of changes.
But how can we be sure that this history is authentic and error-free?
We can use event streams as a primary source of truth in a system.
To get the current state of an object, we have to replay all events in the order of occurrence.
This pattern is called event sourcing. The database for storing event streams is called an event store.
Event sourcing provides a complete and accurate record of all changes made to a system.
Event sourcing is an industry standard for implementing audit trail.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are specialized databases for event sourcing.
Developer Advocates working for the companies behind these specialized databases said
you shouldn't implement event sourcing with traditional relational or document-oriented databases.
Is this true or just a marketing ploy?</p>
<p dir="auto">Specialized databases for event sourcing are convenient and provide the necessary functionality out of the box.
But PostgreSQL, the world's most advanced open-source database, is also suitable for event sourcing.
You can use PostgreSQL as an event store without additional frameworks or extensions
instead of setting up and maintaining a separate specialized database for event sourcing.</p>
<p dir="auto">This repository provides a reference implementation of an event-sourced system
that uses PostgreSQL as an event store built with Spring Boot.
<a href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/fork">Fork</a> the repository and use it as a template for your projects.
Or clone the repository and run end-to-end tests to see how everything works together.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-state-oriented-persistence" dir="auto"><a href="#state-oriented-persistence"></a><a id="user-content-3-1"></a>State-oriented persistence</h3>
<p dir="auto">State-oriented persistence (CRUD) applications store only the latest version of an entity.
Database records present entities.
When an entity is updated, the corresponding database record gets updated too.
SQL <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code> and <code>DELETE</code> statements are used.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/img/state-oriented-persistence.svg"><img src="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/raw/main/img/state-oriented-persistence.svg" alt="State-oriented persistence"></a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-event-sourcing" dir="auto"><a href="#event-sourcing"></a><a id="user-content-3-2"></a>Event sourcing</h3>
<p dir="auto">Event sourcing applications persist the state of an entity as a sequence of immutable state-changing events.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/img/event-sourcing-1.svg"><img src="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/raw/main/img/event-sourcing-1.svg" alt="Event sourcing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Whenever the state of an entity changes, a new event is appended to the list of events.
Only SQL <code>INSERT</code> statements are used.
Events are immutables, so SQL <code>UPDATE</code> and <code>DELETE</code> statements are not used.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/img/event-sourcing-2.svg"><img src="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/raw/main/img/event-sourcing-2.svg" alt="Event sourcing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The current state of an entity can be restored by replaying all its events.</p>
<p dir="auto">Event sourcing is closely related to domain-driven design (DDD) and shares some terminology.</p>
<p dir="auto">An entity in event sourcing is called an <strong>aggregate</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">A sequence of events for the same aggregate is called a <strong>stream</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Event sourcing is best suited for short-living entities with a small total number of
events (e.g., orders).</p>
<p dir="auto">Restoring the state of the short-living entity by replaying all its events doesn't have any
performance impact. Thus, no optimizations for restoring state are required for short-living
entities.</p>
<p dir="auto">For endlessly stored entities (e.g., users, bank accounts) with thousands of events restoring state
by replaying all events is not optimal, and snapshotting should be considered.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-snapshotting" dir="auto"><a href="#snapshotting"></a><a id="user-content-3-3"></a>Snapshotting</h3>
<p dir="auto">Snapshotting is an optimization technique where a snapshot of the aggregate's state is also saved,
so an application can restore the current state of the aggregate from the snapshot rather than from
all the events (potentially thousands).</p>
<p dir="auto">On every <em>nth</em> event, make an aggregate snapshot by storing an aggregate state and its version.</p>
<p dir="auto">To restore an aggregate state:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>first read the latest snapshot,</li>
<li>then read events forward from the original stream starting from the version pointed by the snapshot.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/img/event-sourcing-snapshotting.svg"><img src="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/raw/main/img/event-sourcing-snapshotting.svg" alt="Snapshotting in event souring"></a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-querying-the-data" dir="auto"><a href="#querying-the-data"></a><a id="user-content-3-4"></a>Querying the data</h3>
<p dir="auto">It's easy to find an aggregate by ID, but other queries are difficult.
Since aggregates are stored as append-only lists of immutable events,
querying the data using SQL, as we used to, is impossible.
To find an aggregate by some field, we need to first read all the events and replay them to restore all the aggregates.</p>
<p dir="auto">To bring back all the querying power a relational database has to offer,
we can create a dedicated read model derived from the event stream.</p>
<p dir="auto">The event stream is the write model and the primary source of truth.</p>
<p dir="auto">The read model is a "denormalized" view of the write model, allowing faster and more convenient querying.
Read models are projections of the system state.
Therefore, read models are also known as <strong>projections</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Projections provide a view of data for a single aggregate type
or perform aggregations and combine data from multiple aggregate types.</p>
<p dir="auto">That's where CQRS comes in handy.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-cqrs" dir="auto"><a href="#cqrs"></a><a id="user-content-3-5"></a>CQRS</h3>
<p dir="auto">Command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS) stands for segregating the responsibility between
commands (write requests) and queries (read requests).
The write requests and the read requests are processed by different handlers.</p>
<p dir="auto">A command generates zero or more events or results in an error.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/img/cqrs-1.svg"><img src="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/raw/main/img/cqrs-1.svg" alt="CQRS"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">CQRS is a self-sufficient architectural pattern and doesn't require event sourcing.
But in practice, event sourcing is usually used in conjunction with CQRS.
Event store is used as a write database, and SQL or NoSQL database as a read database.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/img/cqrs-2.svg"><img src="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/raw/main/img/cqrs-2.svg" alt="CQRS with event sourcing"></a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-event-handlers" dir="auto"><a href="#event-handlers"></a><a id="user-content-3-6"></a>Event handlers</h3>
<p dir="auto">Commands generate events.
Event processing is done by <strong>event handlers</strong>.
As a part of event processing, we may need to update projections,
send a message to a message broker, or make an API call.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are two types of event handlers: <strong>synchronous</strong> and <strong>asynchronous</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Storing the write model and read model in the same database allows for transactional updates of the read model.
Each time we append a new event, the projection is updated <strong>synchronously</strong> in the same transaction.
The projection is <strong>consistent</strong> with the event stream.</p>
<p dir="auto">When an event handler communicates with an external system or middleware (e.g., sends a message to Kafka),
it should run <strong>asynchronously</strong> after the transaction updating the write model.
Asynchronous execution leads to <strong>eventual consistency</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Communication with external systems should not occur in the same transaction updating the write model.
The external system call may succeed, but the transaction will later be rolled back, resulting in an inconsistency.</p>
<p dir="auto">Anyway, distributed systems should be designed with eventual consistency in mind.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-domain-events-vs-integration-events" dir="auto"><a href="#domain-events-vs-integration-events"></a><a id="user-content-3-7"></a>Domain events vs Integration events</h3>
<p dir="auto">Events in event sourcing are <strong>domain events</strong>.
The domain event is a part of a bounded context and should not be used "as-is" for integration with other bounded
contexts.</p>
<p dir="auto">For communication between bounded contexts <strong>integration events</strong> are used.
The integration event represents the current state of an aggregate, not just changes to the aggregate as a domain event.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-advantages-of-cqrs" dir="auto"><a href="#advantages-of-cqrs"></a><a id="user-content-3-8"></a>Advantages of CQRS</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Independent scaling of the read and write databases.</li>
<li>Optimized data schema for the read database (e.g. the read databases can be denormalized).</li>
<li>Simpler queries (e.g. complex <code>JOIN</code> operations can be avoided).</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-advantages-of-event-sourcing" dir="auto"><a href="#advantages-of-event-sourcing"></a><a id="user-content-3-9"></a>Advantages of event sourcing</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A true history of the system (audit and traceability).
An industry standard for implementing audit trail.</li>
<li>Ability to put the system in any prior state (e.g. for debugging).</li>
<li>New read-side projections can be created as needed (later) from events.
It allows responding to future needs and new requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-solution-architecture" dir="auto"><a href="#solution-architecture"></a><a id="user-content-4"></a>Solution architecture</h2>
<p dir="auto">PostgreSQL can be used as an event store.
It will natively support appending events, concurrency control and reading events.
Subscribing on events requires additional implementation.</p>

<p dir="auto">Using PostgreSQL as an event store and a read database allows for transactional updates of the read model.
Each time we append a new event, the projection is updated synchronously in the same transaction.
It's a big advantage because sometimes consistency is not so easy to achieve.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can't get consistent projections when a separate database is used as an event store.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-asynchronously-sending-integration-events-to-a-message-broker" dir="auto"><a href="#asynchronously-sending-integration-events-to-a-message-broker"></a><a id="user-content-4-7"></a>Asynchronously sending integration events to a message broker</h3>
<p dir="auto">Integration events should be sent asynchronously after the transaction updating the write model.</p>
<p dir="auto">PostgreSQL doesn't allow subscribing on changes, so the solution is a Transactional Outbox pattern.
A service that uses a database inserts events into an outbox table as part of the local transaction.
A separate process publishes the events inserted into database to a message broker.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/img/transactional-outbox-1.svg"><img src="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/raw/main/img/transactional-outbox-1.svg" alt="Transactional outbox pattern"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We may have multiple asynchronous event handlers or so-called subscriptions.
The subscription concept is required to keep track of delivered events separately for different event handlers.
The last event processed by the event handler (subscription) is stored in the separate table <code>ES_EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION</code>.
New events are processed by polling the <code>ES_EVENT</code> table.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/img/transactional-outbox-2.svg"><img src="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/raw/main/img/transactional-outbox-2.svg" alt="Transactional outbox pattern with subscriptions"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Since multiple instances of this application can run in parallel,
we need to ensure that any processing only affects the event once.
We don't want more than one event handler instance to handle the same event.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is achieved by acquiring locks on the rows of the <code>ES_EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION</code> table.
We lock the row (<code>SELECT FOR UPDATE</code>) of the currently processed subscription.</p>
<p dir="auto">To not hang other backend instances, we want to skip already locked rows (<code>SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code>)
and lock the "next" subscription.
It allows multiple backend instances to select different subscriptions that do not overlap.
This way, we improve availability and scalability.</p>
<p dir="auto">The event subscription processor polls <code>ES_EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION</code> table every second (interval is configurable) for new events
and processes them:</p>

<p dir="auto">Using only the event ID to track events processed by the subscription is unreliable
and can result in lost events.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>ID</code> column of the <code>ES_EVENT</code> table is of type <code>BIGSERIAL</code>.
It's a notational convenience for creating ID columns having their default values assigned from a <code>SEQUENCE</code> generator.</p>
<p dir="auto">PostgreSQL sequences can't be rolled back.
<code>SELECT nextval('ES_EVENT_ID_SEQ')</code> increments and returns the sequence value.
Even if the transaction is not yet committed, the new sequence value becomes visible to other transactions.</p>
<p dir="auto">If transaction #2 started after transaction #1 but committed first,
the event subscription processor can read the events created by transaction #2, update the last processed event ID,
and thus lose the events created by transaction #1.</p>

<p dir="auto">We use transaction ID with event ID to build a reliable PostgreSQL polling mechanism that doesn't lose events.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each event is supplemented with the current transaction ID.
<code>pg_current_xact_id()</code> returns the current transaction's ID of type <code>xid8</code>.
<code>xid8</code> values increase strictly monotonically and cannot be reused in the lifetime of a database cluster.</p>
<p dir="auto">The latest event that is "safe" to process is right before the <code>xmin</code> of the current snapshot.
<code>pg_current_snapshot()</code> returns a current snapshot, a data structure showing which transaction IDs are now in-progress.
<code>pg_snapshot_xmin(pg_snapshot)</code> returns the <code>xmin</code> of a snapshot.
<code>xmin</code> is the lowest transaction ID that was still active.
All transaction IDs less than <code>xmin</code> are either committed and visible, or rolled back.</p>
<p dir="auto">Even if transaction #2 started after transaction #1 and committed first,
the events it created won't be read by the event subscription processor until transaction #1 is committed.</p>

<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-database-polling" dir="auto"><a href="#database-polling"></a><a id="user-content-4-7-2"></a>Database polling</h4>
<p dir="auto">To get new events from the <code>ES_EVENT</code> table, the application has to poll the database.
The shorter the polling period, the shorter the delay between persisting a new event and processing it by the subscription.
But the lag is inevitable. If the polling period is 1 second, then the lag is at most 1 second.</p>
<p dir="auto">The polling mechanism implementation <a href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/eventsourcing/service/ScheduledEventSubscriptionProcessor.java">ScheduledEventSubscriptionProcessor</a>
uses a Spring annotation <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/Scheduled.html" rel="nofollow">@Scheduled</a> to poll database with a fixed period.</p>
<p dir="auto">The polling event subscription processing can be enabled and configured in the <a href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/src/main/resources/application.yml"><code>application.yml</code></a></p>

<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-database-polling-alternative" dir="auto"><a href="#database-polling-alternative"></a><a id="user-content-4-7-3"></a>Database polling alternative</h4>
<p dir="auto">To reduce the lag associated with database polling, the polling period can be set to a very low value,
such as 1 second.
But this means that there will be 3600 database queries per hour and 86400 per day, even if there are no new events.</p>
<p dir="auto">PostgreSQL <code>LISTEN</code> and <code>NOTIFY</code> feature can be used instead of polling.
This mechanism allows for sending asynchronous notifications across database connections.
Notifications are not sent directly from the application,
but via the database <a href="https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing/blob/main/src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__notify_trigger.sql">trigger</a> on a table.</p>
<p dir="auto">To use this functionality an unshared <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/publicapi/org/postgresql/jdbc/PgConnection.html" rel="nofollow">PgConnection</a>
which remains open is required.
The long-lived dedicated JDBC <code>Connection</code> for receiving notifications has to be created using the <code>DriverManager</code> API,
instead of getting from a pooled <code>DataSource</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">PostgreSQL JDBC driver can't receive asynchronous notifications
and must poll the backend to check if any notifications were issued.
A timeout can be given to the poll function <code>getNotifications(int timeoutMillis)</code>,
but then the execution of statements from other threads will block.
When <code>timeoutMillis</code> = 0, blocks forever or until at least one notification has been received.
It means that notification is delivered almost immediately, without a lag.
If more than one notification is about to be received, these will be returned in one batch.</p>
<p dir="auto">This solution  significantly reduces the number of issued queries
and also solves the lag problem that the polling solution suffers from.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-drawbacks" dir="auto"><a href="#drawbacks"></a><a id="user-content-4-9"></a>Drawbacks</h3>
<p dir="auto">Using PostgreSQL as an event store has a lot of advantages, but there are also drawbacks.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Asynchronous event handlers can process the same event more than once.</strong>
It might crash after processing an event but before recording the fact that it has done so.
When it restarts, it will then process the same event again (e.g., send an integration event).
Integration events are delivered with <strong>at-least-once</strong> delivery guarantee.
The exactly-once delivery guarantee is hard to achieve due to a dual-write.
A dual-write describes a situation when you need to atomically update the database and publish messages
without two-phase commit (2PC).
Consumers of integration events should be idempotent and filter duplicates and unordered events.</li>
<li>The asynchronous event handling results in the <strong>eventual consistency between the write model and sent integration events</strong>.
The polling database table for new events with a fixed delay introduces a full consistency lag
greater than or equal to the interval between polls (1 second by default).</li>
<li><strong>A long-running transaction in the same database will effectively "pause" all event handlers.</strong>
<code>pg_snapshot_xmin(pg_snapshot)</code> will return the ID of this long-running transaction
and events created by all later transactions will be read by the event subscription processor
only after this long-running transaction is committed.</li>

      <p>AV1 is the next-gen open-source royalty-free video codec created by the Alliance for Open Media (AOM), a group founded by Google, Mozilla, Cisco, Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon, and Intel. Apple is also a member.</p>
<p>We are finally seeing more hardware support for this codec. The new <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-unveils-m3-m3-pro-and-m3-max-the-most-advanced-chips-for-a-personal-computer/">M3 chips</a> from Apple support AV1 decode. The <a href="https://bitmovin.com/apple-av1-support/">iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> also feature an AV1 hardware decoder.</p>
<p>The official <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/compatibility/14/android-14-cdd#:~:text=H%2D0%2D3%5D-,AV1,-End%20new%20requirements">Android 14 Compatibility Definition</a> makes support for AV1 mandatory. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, widely used by Android phones released in 2023, <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-8-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-8-gen-2-mobile-platform#:~:text=Codecs%3A%20Hybrid%20Log%20Gamma%20(HLG)%2C%20HDR10%2B%2C%20AV1%2C%20H.264%20(Advanced%20Video%20Coding%20(AVC))%2C%20VP9%2C%20VP8%2C%20Dolby%20Vision%C2%AE%2C%20H.265%20(High%20Efficiency%20Video%20Coding%20(HEVC))%2C%20HDR10">supports AV1</a>.</p>
<p>With the exception of Microsoft Edge, all browsers support AV1.</p>

<p><img alt="LINUX STORAGE" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/linuxstorage.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
Less than twenty-four hours after <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Bcachefs-Tries-For-Linux-6.7">Bcachefs was submitted for Linux 6.7</a>, this new open-source file-system has been successfully merged for this next kernel version.
</p><p>
Given the past struggles to get <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Bcachefs">Bcachefs</a> mainlined, I certainly didn't expect to see Linus Torvalds act so soon on merging it. But after it spent all of the 6.6 cycle within Linux-Next, overnight Linus Torvalds did in fact land this new file-system developed by Kent Overstreet.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2023&amp;image=bcachefs_merged" alt="Bcachefs merged"></p>
<p>It's <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=9e87705289667a6c5185c619ea32f3d39314eb1b">merged</a> and I'll be running some fresh Bcachefs file-system benchmarks soon on Phoronix. Keep in mind though this file-system is initially considered experimental.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.vzbv.de/urteile/gericht-untersagt-datenschutzverstoesse-von-linkedin">https://www.vzbv.de/urteile/gericht-untersagt-datenschutzverstoesse-von-linkedin</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38081633">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Das soziale Netzwerk LinkedIn darf auf seiner Webseite nicht mehr mitteilen, dass es auf „Do-Not-Track“-Signale nicht reagiert, mit denen </strong><strong>Nutzer:innen</strong><strong> der Nachverfolgung („Tracking“) ihres Surfverhaltens per Browsereinstellung widersprechen. Das hat das Landgericht Berlin nach einer Klage des Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverbands (vzbv) entschieden. Das Gericht untersagte dem Unternehmen außerdem eine Voreinstellung, nach der das Profil des Mitglieds auch auf anderen Webseiten und Anwendungen sichtbar ist. Bereits im vergangenen Jahr hatte das Gericht den ungebetenen Versand von E-Mails an Nichtmitglieder untersagt.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>„Wenn Verbraucher:innen die ,Do-Not-Track‘-Funktion ihres Browsers aktivieren, ist das eine klare Botschaft: Sie wollen nicht, dass ihr Surfverhalten für Werbe- und andere Zwecke ausgespäht wird“, sagt Rosemarie Rodden, Rechtsreferenin beim vzbv. „Webseitenbetreiber müssen dieses Signal respektieren.“</p>

<p>Widerspruch gegen Tracking ignoriert&nbsp;</p>

<p>Internetsurfer:innen können über ihren Browser einstellen, dass die besuchten Webseiten ein „Do-Not-Track“ (DNT)-Signal erhalten. Es übermittelt ihren Wunsch, dass die Online-Aktivitäten nicht nachverfolgt und ausgewertet werden. LinkedIn hatte auf seiner Internetseite mitgeteilt, dass es auf solche DNT-Signale nicht reagiert. Somit können auch gegen den Willen der Nutzer:innen personenbezogene Daten wie die IP-Adresse und Informationen über die Nutzung der Webseite etwa für Analyse- und Marketingzwecke ausgewertet werden, auch von Drittanbietern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Das Landgericht Berlin schloss sich der Auffassung des vzbv an, dass die Mitteilung des Unternehmens irreführend war. Sie suggeriere, dass die Benutzung des DNT-Signals rechtlich irrelevant sei und die Beklagte ein solches Signal nicht zu beachten brauche. Das treffe nicht zu. Das Widerspruchsrecht gegen die Verarbeitung persönlicher Daten könne nach der Datenschutzgrundverordnung auch per automatisierten Verfahren ausgeübt werden. Ein DNT-Signal stelle einen wirksamen Widerspruch dar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Einen weiteren Antrag in diesem Zusammenhang lehnte das Gericht aus prozessualen Gründen ab.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Profil ohne erforderliche Einwilligung veröffentlicht&nbsp;</p>

<p>In allen weiteren Punkten war die vzbv-Klage ohne Einschränkung erfolgreich. Das Gericht untersagte LinkedIn, bei der erstmaligen Anmeldung die Funktion „Sichtbarkeit des Profils“ zu aktivieren. Durch diese Voreinstellung war das persönliche LinkedIn-Profil ohne Zustimmung auch für Nicht-Mitglieder sowie außerhalb des Netzwerkes – etwa auf Suchmaschinen – öffentlich sichtbar. Die Richter:innen stellten klar, dass ein von vornherein aktivierter Schalter nicht die Anforderungen an eine wirksame Einwilligung in die Veröffentlichung personenbezogener Daten erfüllt. „Nutzerprofile dürfen nicht automatisch öffentlich einsehbar sein, wenn sie angelegt werden“, so Rosemarie Rodden.</p>

<p>Ungebetener E-Mail-Versand verboten&nbsp;</p>

<p>Einem Teil der Klage hatte das LG Berlin bereits im vergangenen Jahr stattgegeben. So ist es LinkedIn inzwischen verboten, E-Mail-Einladungen an Verbraucher:innen zu versenden, die nicht Mitglied des Netzwerks sind und die der Verwendung ihrer E-Mail-Adresse nicht zugestimmt haben. Außerdem untersagte das Gericht in einem weiteren Teil-Anerkenntnisurteil die Verwendung mehrerer Bestimmungen in den Geschäftsbedingungen des Unternehmens, darunter Klauseln, nach denen nur die englische Vertragsfassung verbindlich sein soll und ein Rechtsstreit nur im irischen Dublin ausgetragen werden darf.</p>

The 65W chip also wields a Radeon Vega iGPU with seven compute units clocked up to 1.9 GHz. Remember that APUs don't have dedicated memory but share system memory. You can determine the amount of memory inside the motherboard’s BIOS. In this case, the Redditor had 32GB of DDR4 and allocated 16GB to the Ryzen 5 4600G. Typically, 16GB is the maximum amount of memory you can dedicate to the iGPU. However, some user reports claim that certain ASRock AMD motherboards allow for higher memory allocation, rumored up to 64GB.</p><p>The trick converts the Ryzen 5 4600G into a 16GB "graphics card," flaunting more memory than some of Nvidia's latest <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/features/nvidia-ada-lovelace-and-geforce-rtx-40-series-everything-we-know" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/features/nvidia-ada-lovelace-and-geforce-rtx-40-series-everything-we-know">GeForce RTX 40-series</a> SKUs, such as the <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review">GeForce RTX 4070</a> or <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review-a-costly-70-class-gpu" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review-a-costly-70-class-gpu">GeForce RTX 4070 Ti</a>, which are limited to 12GB. Logically, the APU doesn't deliver the same performance as a high-end graphics card, but at least it won't run out of memory during AI workloads, as 16GB is plenty for non-serious tasks.</p><p>AMD's <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-to-expand-rocm-support-to-pro-and-consumer-rdna-3-gpus-this-fall" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-to-expand-rocm-support-to-pro-and-consumer-rdna-3-gpus-this-fall">Radeon Open Compute platform</a> (ROCm) doesn't officially support Ryzen APUs. Third-party companies, such as BruhnBruhn Holding, offer experimental packages of ROCm that'll work with APUs. That means APUs can work with PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks, opening the gate to most AI software. We wonder if AMD's latest mobile Ryzen chips, like Phoenix that taps into DDR5 memory, can work and what kind of performance they bring.</p><p>The Redditor shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPO7fu7Vyw4" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPO7fu7Vyw4">YouTube video</a> claiming that the Ryzen 5 4600G could run a plethora of AI applications, including Stable Diffusion, FastChat, MiniGPT-4, Alpaca-LoRA, Whisper, LLM, and LLaMA. Unfortunately, he only provided demos for Stable Diffusion, an AI image generator based on text input. He doesn't detail how he got the Ryzen 5 4600G to work with the AI software on his Linux system. The YouTuber has vouched to release a thorough video of the setup process.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the performance, the Ryzen 5 4600G only took around one minute and 50 seconds to generate a 512 x 512-pixel image with the default setting of 50 steps. It's an excellent result for a $95 APU and rivals some high-end processors. The author said he used DDR4 memory but didn't list the specifications. Although the Ryzen 5 4600G natively supports DDR4-3200, many samples can hit DDR4-4000, so it would be fascinating to see AI performance scaling with faster memory.</p><p>The experiment is fantastic for those who own a Ryzen 5 4600G or Ryzen 5 5600G and want to play around with AI. For those who don't, throwing $500 into an APU build doesn't make much sense when you can probably get a discrete graphics card that offers better performance. For instance, AMD's <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-brags-about-cheaper-16gb-gpus" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-brags-about-cheaper-16gb-gpus">Radeon 16GB graphics cards</a> start at $499, and Nvidia recently launched the <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-16gb-review" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-16gb-review">GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB</a>, which has a similar starting price.</p>

        <p>The team behind Nasa’s Osiris-REx mission is struggling to open fully the container holding the bulk of the sample from asteroid Bennu. Since the 4.5 billion year-old sample landed in the Utah desert earlier this month, scientists have already managed to collect 70.3 grams of rocks and dust lying on the outside of the container, as well as some from inside the sampler head. But last week they realised that two of the 35 fasteners on the head could not be removed with the current tools approved for use in the Osiris-REx glovebox – where the work is performed under a flow of nitrogen to prevent contamination through exposure to Earth’s atmosphere. Nasa <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/osiris-rex/2023/10/20/nasas-osiris-rex-achieves-sample-mass-milestone/">said</a> the team is working on finding a new procedure to extract the remaining material. This might delay the process by a few weeks. Not too bad for a seven-year mission that might help explain the origins of life on Earth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a statement supplied to<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-will-block-unauthorized-third-party-controllers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em> GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>, Microsoft explained that the error is in fact part of its new policy which will be rolled out worldwide from November 17.</p>
<p>“Microsoft and other licensed Xbox hardware partners’ accessories are designed and manufactured with quality standards for performance, security, and safety,” it said.</p>
<p>“Unauthorised accessories can compromise the gaming experience on Xbox consoles (<a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/xbox-series-xs">Xbox Series X/S</a>.) Gamers may receive a pop-up warning that their accessory is unauthorised.</p>
<p>“Eventually, the unauthorised accessory will be blocked from use to preserve the console gaming experience. For a full list of accessories that are supported on Xbox consoles, please visit www.xbox.com/accessories.”</p>
<p>Sources who spoke to<em> Windows Central</em> suggested that through this Microsoft is attempting to make the manufacture of official third-party controllers easier.</p>

<p>This way, new controllers will be allowed to use wireless features that work with the Xbox, potentially by putting a security chip inside them. However, it will spell the end of those that already exist if they were not approved by Microsoft.</p>
<p>In other gaming news, <a href="https://www.nme.com/games/the-finals"><em>The Finals</em> </a>has been criticised for <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/the-finals-sloppy-ai-voice-acting-criticised-by-voice-actors-3525621">the use of AI to voice its commentators and contestants</a>, though the developer explained that this “gets [the team] far enough in terms of quality”.</p>

                 <h2><strong>The M3 Family Arrives</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>The M3 family of chips continues Apple silicon’s tremendous pace of innovation. M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max are the first chips for a personal computer built using the industry-leading 3-nanometer technology. With a faster, more efficient next-generation GPU, these chips deliver the biggest leap forward in graphics architecture ever for Apple silicon. Featuring a breakthrough technology called Dynamic Caching, the GPU allocates the use of local memory in hardware in real time so only the exact amount of memory needed is used for each task. This dramatically increases GPU utilization and performance for the most demanding pro apps and games.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The GPU also brings new rendering features to Apple silicon, including hardware-accelerated mesh shading for greater capability and efficiency with geometry processing, enabling more visually complex scenes. And hardware-accelerated ray tracing comes to the Mac for the first time, enabling games to render more accurate shadows and reflections to create more realistic environments.

The M3 Max model is up to 11x faster than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Pro model.<sup>5</sup> With the power efficiency of Apple silicon, for the vast majority of workloads, users will never hear the fans. Battery life also soars with up to 11 additional hours compared to the fastest Intel-based MacBook Pro model,<sup>5</sup> and unlike many PC laptops, MacBook Pro delivers the same incredible performance whether plugged in or on battery. The Liquid Retina XDR display is the world’s best laptop display, with an exceptional 1000 nits sustained and 1600 nits of peak brightness for HDR content, impressive contrast ratio, vivid colors, and an outstanding viewing angle. SDR content is now displayed at up to 600 nits, which is 20 percent brighter than before.

                 <div>macOS Sonoma brings a rich set of features to the Mac for work and play. Users can now place widgets right on the desktop, interact with them with just a click, and access the extensive ecosystem of iPhone widgets on their Mac through the magic of Continuity. Video conferencing is even more engaging with features to help users present remotely, including Presenter Overlay, which places the presenter on top of the content being shared; and Reactions, which enable fun gesture-triggered video effects in cinematic quality. In Safari, Profiles keeps browsing separate between multiple topics or projects, and web apps provide faster access to favorite sites. And a collection of stunning new screen savers features slow-motion videos of locations around the world.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>macOS Sonoma also takes full advantage of the capabilities of Apple silicon, offering powerful new features for pros. The new high performance mode in Screen Sharing enables extremely responsive remote access to another Mac so pros can securely work on their highest-quality content from anywhere. Game Mode prioritizes graphics tasks to deliver consistently high frame rates and drastically reduce latency with wireless accessories for even more immersive gameplay with titles like Baldur’s Gate 3, Lies of P, and DEATH STRANDING DIRECTOR’S CUT.

</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The M3 family of chips features a next-generation GPU that represents the biggest leap forward in graphics architecture ever for Apple silicon.

And, a new media engine now includes support for AV1 decode, providing more efficient and high-quality video experiences from streaming services. The M3 family of chips continues the tremendous pace of innovation in Apple silicon, and brings massive enhancements and new features to the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/" target="_blank">MacBook Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/imac/" target="_blank">iMac</a>.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“Apple silicon has completely redefined the Mac experience. Every aspect of its architecture is designed for performance and power efficiency,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. “With 3-nanometer technology, a next-generation GPU architecture, a higher-performance CPU, faster Neural Engine, and support for even more unified memory, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max are the most advanced chips ever built for a personal computer.”

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>The next-generation GPU inside the M3 family of chips represents the largest leap forward in graphics architecture for Apple silicon. It features Dynamic Caching that, unlike traditional GPUs, allocates the use of local memory in hardware in real time. With Dynamic Caching, only the exact amount of memory needed is used for each task. This is an industry first, transparent to developers, and the cornerstone of the new GPU architecture. It dramatically increases the average utilization of the GPU, which significantly increases performance for the most demanding pro apps and games.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>With the M3 family of chips, hardware-accelerated ray tracing comes to the Mac for the first time. Ray tracing models the properties of light as it interacts with a scene, allowing apps to create extremely realistic and physically accurate images. This, along with the new graphics architecture, allows pro apps to deliver up to 2.5x the speed of the M1 family of chips. Game developers can use ray tracing for more accurate shadows and reflections, creating deeply immersive environments. Additionally, the new GPU brings hardware-accelerated mesh shading to the Mac, delivering greater capability and efficiency to geometry processing, and enabling more visually complex scenes in games and graphics-intensive apps. This breakthrough GPU architecture enables all of these enhancements and features while maintaining Apple silicon’s legendary power efficiency. In fact, the M3 GPU is able to deliver the same performance as M1 using nearly half the power, and up to 65 percent more performance at its peak.

As such it supports many different device types and CPU architectures. We’re excited to be adding a new one to that list - RISC-V. </p>

<p><a href="https://riscv.org/" target="_blank">RISC-V</a> is a free and open instruction set architecture (ISA), bringing the same spirit of industry-wide collaboration and innovation that we see in software around <a href="https://opensource.org/" target="_blank">open source</a> to the hardware ecosystem. Invented <a href="https://riscv.org/about/history/" target="_blank">10 years ago</a> at the University of California, Berkeley, RISC-V has seen rapid adoption in embedded and microcontroller spaces, and in recent years has expanded into accelerators, servers, and mobile computing.</p>

<p>In November of 2022, we announced at the RISC-V Summit that we were accepting patches for RISC-V:</p>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" height="355" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/70O_RmTWP58" width="100%" youtube-src-id="70O_RmTWP58"></iframe>

<p>The latest update that we have is that now not only are we accepting patches, but we have begun to mature support for RISC-V in Android. RISC-V is a modular ISA, meaning that there are a large number of optional extensions. We have also determined an initial set that we feel is critical to ensure that any CPU running RISC-V will have all of the features we expect to achieve high performance. This set includes the rva22 profile as well as the vector and vector crypto extensions. This update was provided at the RISC-V summit in Europe:</p>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" height="355" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xLwdUn3DQp8" width="100%" youtube-src-id="xLwdUn3DQp8"></iframe>

<p>You can build, test, and run the Android support for RISC-V on your own machine as well now! Just like other platform targets in AOSP, you can use the <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/setup/create/cuttlefish" target="_blank">Cuttlefish</a> Virtual Device <a href="https://github.com/google/android-riscv64" target="_blank">support</a>:</p>

<span>$ </span>m -j
<span>$ </span>launch_cvd -cpus=<span>8</span> -memory_mb=<span>8192</span></span></code></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Then, you can use <span>vncviewer</span> to connect to the running device and interact.</p>

<p><img alt="Moving image of vncviewer running on an Android device" id="imgCaption" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg3v8et5Vd6_ZPwaPPzWdy2b6pvkpJnBN0-cKGupeQwdBSR7_IxBlqGoFACGGc1EAU9q4s9LTqLlLZt7dHiNAUjC2uU0H3IGiJkL_wENRxkNcLzEBIxej2bzznTpQyK8_65Xc0PE6qLK88fnyI4erogsMq2lWghTi87TkH4keNYRNE4VY2qR0Dydx2nlYU/s1600/Demo-ASOP.gif"></p>

<p>At this time, <a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/q/owner:maohan4761%2540gmail.com" target="_blank">these patches</a> will support building and running a basic Android Open Source Project experience, but are not yet fully optimized. For example, work on a fully optimized backend for the Android Runtime (ART) is still a work in progress. Additionally, AOSP, our external projects, and compilers haven’t generated fully optimized, reduced code that also takes advantage of the latest ratified extensions, such as the one for <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/v1.0" target="_blank">vectors</a>. However, we believe that it is ready to allow experimentation and collaboration.</p> 

<p>Later this year, we expect to have the NDK ABI finalized and canary builds available on Android’s public <a href="https://ci.android.com/builds/branches/aosp-master-ndk/grid" target="_blank">CI</a> soon and RISC-V on x86-64 &amp; ARM64 available for easier testing of riscv64 Android applications on a host machine. By 2024, the plan is to have emulators available publicly, with a full feature set to test applications for various device form factors! As recently <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/10/qualcomm-to-bring-risc-v-based-wearable-platform-to--wear-os-by-" target="_blank">announced</a> in our collaboration with Qualcomm, we expect wearables to be the first form factor available.</p>

<p>However, just porting the Android operating system itself is not enough! We are working with the community and <a href="https://riseproject.dev/" target="_blank">RISE</a> (RISC-V Software Ecosystem). The RISE Project has been established to provide a way to accelerate the availability of software for high-performance and power-efficient RISC-V processor cores running high-level operating systems. That includes not only Android, but also Linux and other operating systems across a variety of application domains, including high-performance computing. The RISE Project includes members from Andes, Google, Intel, Imagination Technologies, MediaTek, Nvidia, Qualcomm Technologies, Red Hat, Rivos, Samsung, SiFive, T-Head, and Ventana.</p>

<p>Google is also continuing and expanding our strong investments at <a href="https://riscv.org/" target="_blank">RISC-V International</a>, even beyond our long-standing Premium membership and <a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/board/" target="_blank">board participation</a>. We also have many other contributors in key roles on horizontal committees, working groups, and technical committees to ensure that specifications are rapidly being designed and ratified to benefit not only Android but also many other use cases.</p>

<p>Android's support for RISC-V is dependent on a wide range of contributions from <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/" target="_blank">toolchain</a> to basic support libraries. We are very appreciative of the ongoing efforts which requires countless projects to support RISC-V build configurations and quality implementations.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-post-id="2380960">
									<p>A little more than a week ago, I wrote <a href="https://news.artnet.com/opinion/devon-rodriguez-painter-tiktok-underground-2373157" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a review</a> of an art show by the artist and TikTok sensation Devon Rodriguez, best known for live drawing subway riders. He is, by some measures, the most famous artist in the world, with many millions of social media followers. He did not like the review.</p>
<p>It went up on a Friday. On Saturday morning, I woke up to a tidal wave of anger from Rodriguez on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CyGPe42gBSt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>, tagging me across scores of posts. Hundreds of his followers went on the attack, swarming my Instagram: “loser,” “hater,” “pathetic,” “jealous,” “your a dick,” and on and on and on. There were many creative variations on “kill yourself.” Others said they were going to get me fired, or said things like, “we are going to start a cancellation campaign against you.” A large number thought that defending Rodriguez meant calling me bald, ugly, fat, or whatever they thought could get under my skin. Most didn’t seem to have actually read my article. A contingent went after my wife. “Some women will do anything for money,” one commented. That one was funny, actually.</p>
<p>After a few days Rodriguez ceased tagging me, and the wave of hate cooled down. “@benstoppable love will always outshine being a hater, I hope I taught you that today,” Rodriguez posted.</p>
<div id="attachment_2381034"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2381034" loading="lazy" src="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-screenshot-1-628x1024.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a post by Devon Rodriguez to Instagram stories. " width="628" height="1024" srcset="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-screenshot-1-628x1024.jpg 628w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-screenshot-1-184x300.jpg 184w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-screenshot-1-31x50.jpg 31w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-screenshot-1.jpg 797w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2381034">Screenshot of a post by Devon Rodriguez to Instagram stories.</p></div>
<p>Meanwhile, I also received an urgent email from UTA Artist Space: “Devon (who we represent) nor UTA was given a chance to respond to this very negative and one-sided article.” I wrote back that I had never heard of an artist demanding to comment on a review in advance, but that if Rodriguez or UTA wanted to write a reply, we would publish it.</p>
<p>It’s not the first time that an artist has been mad at me—only the first time that an artist with this particular type of fame has gone out of his way to unleash his fans in this way. It’s also not anywhere near the worst or most important thing going on in the world, obviously. Nevertheless, I do think it raises some larger issues worth thinking about.</p>

<h4><strong>A Shifting Attention Economy&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>In his torrent of posts, Rodriguez takes big issue with my opener: “Devon Rodriguez is almost certainly the most famous artist in the world, at least on one level,” I wrote. “Almost no one I know has ever heard of him. Except if you say: ‘he’s the painter who draws people on the subway, from TikTok.’ Then sometimes they will light up with recognition.”</p>
<p>His response: “no one he knows has ever heard of me… as if the people that HE knows are more important than everybody else in this world that follows me.. Sorry that I’m not a part of your pretentious circle&nbsp;@benstoppable.”</p>
<div id="attachment_2380606"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2380606" loading="lazy" src="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/07/77744E04-52A0-4728-9AA4-E34ABCD2C48E_1_201_a-589x1024.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of a post by Devon Rodriguez to Instagram stories." width="589" height="1024" srcset="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/07/77744E04-52A0-4728-9AA4-E34ABCD2C48E_1_201_a-589x1024.jpeg 589w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/07/77744E04-52A0-4728-9AA4-E34ABCD2C48E_1_201_a-173x300.jpeg 173w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/07/77744E04-52A0-4728-9AA4-E34ABCD2C48E_1_201_a-883x1536.jpeg 883w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/07/77744E04-52A0-4728-9AA4-E34ABCD2C48E_1_201_a-29x50.jpeg 29w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/07/77744E04-52A0-4728-9AA4-E34ABCD2C48E_1_201_a.jpeg 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2380606">Screenshot of a post by Devon Rodriguez to Instagram stories.</p></div>
<p>But the spirit of the article is clearly, if you read it, the <em>exact</em>&nbsp;<em>opposite</em> of what Rodriguez seems to think it is: I’m arguing that traditional art circles should take the phenomenon seriously, and think through what is really going on with this kind of art career. Rodriguez has a lot of cultural clout—but the fact is that most people who go to museums and galleries or who regularly read about art haven’t heard of him.</p>
<p>This is a very weird feature of the cultural present. Instead of art that gains traction over time via traditional channels and then breaks out to a wider audience, there are now regularly art phenomena that get <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/immersive-van-gogh-experiences-1983011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explosively popular</a> with an immense audience, leaving art institutions and everyone else to <a href="https://news.artnet.com/opinion/beeple-everydays-review-1951656" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sort out</a> what a particular cultural trend means after it has already happened.</p>

<p>Rodriguez is acting as if he is being unfairly scrutinized when he is one of the most influential artists out there, someone who works with <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@devonrodriguezart/video/7272593458991287594" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A-list celebrities</a>, who the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/realestate/tiktok-subway-artist-renters-lower-east-side.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>New York Times</em></a> says has made as much as $30,000 a day working with mega-brands like Cheetos, who has numerous press agents working to stage-manage his image, who is the ambassador for what contemporary art <em>is</em>&nbsp;to the largest possible audience—he even teaches a <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/sessions/classes/create-realistic-paintings-you-are-proud-of" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Masterclass</a> on realistic portrait painting!</p>

<p>“Dude has PRs putting him in the room with <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@devonrodriguezart/video/7254988301164219690" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the president</a> and he’s acting like you are gatekeeping him,” someone wrote me. (I should mention that I’ve received a lot of support too.)</p>
<p>In fact, the only way I can understand Rodriguez’s incredibly thin-skinned reaction to my article is that he has managed to rise to this status of apex visibility without <em>any kind of critical writing about him at all</em>. It’s all just been feel-good profiles, so that the first critical word feels like a huge crisis. That’s a relatively new kind of situation for an artist to be in, and worth analyzing.</p>

<h4><strong>Art Criticism and Parasocial Relationships</strong></h4>
<p>“If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all” was a phrase that commenters repeated a lot. Rodriguez’s art content makes people happy, so why be “negative?” Quite a few people posted variations on, “what is even the point of art critics?” So let me say what purpose an article like the one I wrote might serve.</p>
<p>First: With regard to the paintings themselves, simply repeating press-release hype isn’t healthy for anyone. It happens all the time that artists get stuck doing whatever first brought them success, and dealers or marketers encourage them to just do the same thing because it’s the easiest thing to sell, thereby undermining what could be a more enduring career.</p>
<p>As I repeat in the article, Rodriguez seems a gifted painter, in a photo-inspired realist style. At the same time, when it comes to the show I reviewed, “<a href="https://utaartistspace.com/exhibitions/underground/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Underground,</a>” the subject matter is well-trodden territory. We have 100-plus years of painters doing subway scenes, from <a href="https://whitney.org/collection/works/1560" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reginald Marsh</a> to <a href="https://www.jordancasteel.com/2018-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jordan Casteel</a>, so the question of what is different or exceptional about these particular versions of the theme is accented. Maybe this doesn’t matter to his audience, but it probably <em>does</em> matter to people who are interested in painting.</p>
<p>Still, my question was not even this. It was whether the paintings on their own were enough to explain his extraordinary popularity. And the answer to that question is clearly no.</p>
<div id="attachment_2373240"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2373240" loading="lazy" src="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-underground-1024x768.jpeg" alt="A visitor looks at paintings in &quot;Underground.&quot; P" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-underground-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-underground-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-underground-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-underground-50x38.jpeg 50w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-underground.jpeg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2373240">A visitor looks at paintings in “Underground.” Photo by Ben Davis.</p></div>
<p>That brings me to the second point, which is where the case of Devon Rodriguez is specifically interesting. Basically, I’m arguing that we should think of his social media posts as part of his practice, to be reviewed in and of themselves. These are, after all, not just <em>how</em> he got famous; in some sense they are what he is really famous for. And they are in many cases clearly staged. (There is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/ldrbro/devon_rodriguez_the_artist_who_got_famous_for_his/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long and robust online debate</a> by artists about how real his subway clips are.)</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@devonrodriguezart/video/7286157229861162286?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his post</a> from October 4, where Rodriguez draws a dancer on the London Underground, who turns out to be Sabrina Bahsoon, a.k.a. “<a href="https://mashable.com/article/tiktok-tube-girl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tube Girl</a>.” “I love your moves—are you a professional dancer?” Rodriguez asks at the climax of the clip as he hands the drawing to Bahsoon, who has three quarters of a million TikTok followers and signed with <a href="https://www.thehivemanagement.com/new-faces/sabrina-bahsoon/#book" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hive&nbsp;modeling agency</a> this year. “Definitely not!” she replies, feigning surprise.</p>
<div>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Look who I saw on the tube @Sabrina Bahsoon ✍🏼  #devonrodriguezart #shorts" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ww3AN8dW4U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div>

<p>What do his fans think is going on here? That Rodriguez happened to be in London, and happened to come upon another famous TikToker, and that she continued to dance in front of him for 30 minutes as he sat drawing her, with multiple cameras filming the two of them and his drawing pad, as he created a hyper-detailed portrait of Bahsoon that looks like it is sourced from a close-up photo? The comments are full of people marveling: “How did you do that? She wasn’t standing still. Absolutely incredible.” Or: “HOW DO YOU DRAW THEM WHEN THEY ARE MOVING A LOT?” Or: “Your work is amazing. I keep wondering how you keep the pencil steady on a moving train.” Great questions!</p>
<p>Is it “mean” to point out how fake this is? If there’s no criticism of it, here’s what I think will happen: All the marketing companies and PR people looking to piggyback on Rodriguez’s popularity will stuff his feed with more and more cringe celebrity content and half-baked promo ideas until his social-media presence is bled dry of whatever charm it has.</p>
<div id="attachment_2373239"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2373239" loading="lazy" src="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-video-1024x814.jpeg" alt="Video by UTA Artist Space telling the Devon Rodriguez story, shown in &quot;Underground.&quot; P" width="1024" height="814" srcset="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-video-1024x814.jpeg 1024w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-video-300x239.jpeg 300w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-video-1536x1221.jpeg 1536w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-video-50x40.jpeg 50w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-video.jpeg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2373239">Video by UTA Artist Space telling the Devon Rodriguez story, shown in “Underground.” Photo by Ben Davis.</p></div>
<p>And meanwhile, a lot of fans coming across art through his channel will get a totally confused idea of how contemporary art-celebrity works. Which brings me to the last and most important answer to the question of why I think it’s worth writing about Rodriguez seriously: Because he is a role model for a ton of young artists, and they deserve an actual assessment of what is going on.</p>
<p>“While Devon is instantly recognizable as a TikTok sensation, his story about his rise as a fine artist—from his childhood in the South Bronx to his Subway paintings and achieving Masterclass-worthy expertise—is something we are incredibly excited to share with the art world and beyond,” his agent, Arthur Lewis, wrote in <a href="https://d3kiriw2ovsgup.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/26153557/Press-Release_Devon-Rodriguez-Exhibition-Announcement-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the press release</a> for “Underground.” Artists’ personal stories have long been part of how art is marketed, from Vincent van Gogh to Frida Kahlo, but in those cases, the artists’ paintings attracted interest first, and the biography became part of its legend as its fame grew. Today, personal biography and narrative are more important than ever in the gallery—most art comes equipped with some kind of story. But social media gives an added twist: Hordes of people can feel as if they have a relationship with a painter like Devon Rodriguez without ever having had any direct experience of his painting at all.</p>
<div id="attachment_2373728"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2373728" loading="lazy" src="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-1024x1004.jpg" alt="Devon Rodriguez with fans at the opening of &quot;Underground.&quot;" width="1024" height="1004" srcset="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-1024x1004.jpg 1024w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-300x294.jpg 300w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-1536x1505.jpg 1536w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez-50x50.jpg 50w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2023/10/devon-rodriguez.jpg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2373728">Devon Rodriguez with fans at the opening of “Underground.” Photo by Ben Davis.</p></div>
<p>“What if he was your son??” someone posted at me angrily. This comment is emblematic. It’s not the kind of thing one normally says about an artist getting a critical review (unless the criticism is extremely over the top and disproportionate to the status of the artist in question). Generally, the point of presenting an art show in public is to see if it can hold the attention of people who don’t directly know you.</p>
<p>But it seems to me that the majority of Rodriguez’s fans are most engaged by his appealing social-media persona, <em>not</em> his actual artworks. If this is the case, then it’s logical to think that it changes how criticism is perceived. His followers feel like I am attacking a person they like, not judging artworks or analyzing a media phenomenon. I think that explains the character of the reaction, which has a level of raw personal anger completely out of joint with what I wrote in my article.</p>
<p>Recently there’s been a lot of writing on the increasing currency of “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/04/parasocial-relationships-imaginary-connections-fans-celebrities/673645/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parasocial relationships</a>” in media, that is, the imaginary, one-sided friendships people develop with celebrities and influencers in their heads. It seems to me that Devon Rodriguez’s title as the “most popular painter in the world” shows what a powerful cultural force a “parasocial aesthetic” can be—it’s probably more powerful (or at least more accessible) than interest in paint on canvas.</p>
<p>All the same, Devon Rodriguez’s art agents and PR handlers might gently tell him that, if one of the things you are selling is likability and good vibes, cheering on this kind of vicious reaction every time you get a review you don’t like is probably not a sustainable career path.</p>

  <p>Today, we’re releasing a new version of the RedPajama dataset, with 30 trillion filtered and deduplicated tokens (100+ trillions raw) from 84 CommonCrawl dumps covering 5 languages, along with 40+ pre-computed data quality annotations that can be used for further filtering and weighting.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last half a year, we have been pleased to see that RedPajama-1T, which we released in March, has ignited the creation of many new language models. So many people from the community have downloaded this 5TB dataset---more than 190,000 times and have been using them <a href="https://huggingface.co/search/full-text?q=redpajama"><span>in such creative ways</span></a>! RedPajama-1T consists of 1 trillion high-quality English tokens, but it was only the first step. Today, with the release of RedPajama-V2, we are making a further step towards the development of open datasets by releasing a massive, 30 trillion token web dataset. This is, to our best knowledge, the largest public dataset released specifically for LLM training. Even more excitingly, we include 40+ pre-computed quality annotations, allowing the community to further filter and weigh the data. Specifically, this release includes:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Over 100 billion text documents with 100+ trillion raw tokens from 84 CommonCrawl dumps;</p></li><li><p>40+ of the most widely used quality annotations pre-computed for a deduplicated 30 trillion tokens subset;</p></li><li><p>Five languages: English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian</p></li><li><p>All data processing scripts are open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data"><span>GitHub</span></a>; all data are available on <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-V2"><span>HuggingFace</span></a>.</p></li></ul><h2>Why RedPajama-Data-v2 and How to Use it?</h2><p>A central ingredient to state-of-the-art open LLMs like Llama, Mistral, Falcon, MPT, and the RedPajama models is the large amounts of high-quality data that these models are trained on. For example, Llama 2 is trained on 2.4 trillion carefully curated tokens. The most prominent data sources are the crawls made publicly available by <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/"><span>CommonCrawl</span></a>. However, this data is crude and is not ideal for direct use for LLM training due to artifacts arising from the conversion of HTML to plain text, sources of generally low quality, and biases inherent to the distribution of content on the web. Getting the right dataset and data mixture is painful and any LLM developer has to go through the laborious, time-consuming, energy-intensive and expensive steps of processing and filtering this crude data. Although there have been several community projects around this effort, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683"><span>C4</span></a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-1T"><span>RedPajama-1T,</span></a> <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb"><span>Refinedweb (Falcon)</span></a>, <a href="https://github.com/allenai/dolma"><span>Dolma (AI2)</span></a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/cerebras/SlimPajama-627B"><span>SlimPajama</span></a>, many of them only cover a small portion of the CommonCrawl crawls; moreover, they represent a very specific way in which data are filtered.</p><p>With RedPajama-Data-v2, our goal is to lift this burden off the community and provide a pool of web data serving as a base from which high quality datasets for LLM training can be extracted and based on which LLM training data can be thoroughly researched. It provides, to our best knowledge, the most complete coverage on CommonCrawl (with 84 dumps processed). More importantly, we provide 40+ quality annotations — the result of different ML classifiers on data quality, minhash results that can be used for fuzzy deduplication, or heuristics such as “the fraction of words that contain no alphabetical character”. We provide our best effort implementations of quality annotations used in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683"><span>C4</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11446"><span>Gopher</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13169"><span>Pretrainer’s Guide</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01116"><span>RefinedWeb</span></a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03169"><span>Data Selection for Language Models via Importance Resampling</span></a>. These annotations provide a way for an LLM developer to easily slice and filter the data, combining these into a new data quality pipeline to create their own pre-training dataset.</p><p>Here are some examples! The following code snippets show how one can implement commonly used filtering rules in combination with the RedPajama-V2 dataset. For example, implementing the Gopher rules and use these to filter out documents that do not comply with the Gopher rules is as easy as:</p>

  <p>In the current release, we include 40+ quality annotations, but we very much view this as a “living” project where new additions will be made over time as the field moves towards a better understanding of LLM training data. We hope the community provides feedback, and we are looking forward to continuing to enrich our current pool of annotations.</p><h3>Data Processing Steps</h3><p>RedPajama-V2 focuses on CommonCrawl. Other data sources such as Wikipedia are available in <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-1T"><span>RedPajama-V1</span></a>. We also encourage you to enrich your data mixture with the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack"><span>Stack</span></a> (by BigScience) for code and <a href="https://allenai.org/data/s2orc"><span>s2orc</span></a> (by AI2) for scientific articles. RedPajama-V2 is built from the ground up based on publicly available web data, consisting of 84 crawls provided by CommonCrawl. The core components that this dataset is made of, are the source data (plain text), 40+ quality annotations, and deduplication clusters.</p><h3>Creating the Source Data</h3><p>The first processing step in building this dataset is to pass each CommonCrawl snapshot through the <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.494/"><span>CCNet pipeline</span></a>. We choose this pipeline due to its light processing, aligning with our guiding principle of preserving as much information in the raw dataset as possible and allowing downstream model developers to filter or reweight the dataset. We use the language filter in CCNet and keep five languages in this release: English, French, Spanish, German and Italian. This processing step produces 100 billion individual text documents.&nbsp;</p><h3>Quality Annotations</h3><p>In addition to the text documents processed by CCNet, we compute over 40 of the most widely used quality annotations for the “head” and “middle” buckets. The primary purpose of these annotations is to allow downstream model developers to filter or reweight the dataset based on their criteria, and to foster research into how these annotations should be used. In addition, we also plan, with the help of the community, to include more quality signals over time. With this release, we publish a first set of quality annotations, which consists of our implementations of the most common quality annotations that are described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683"><span>C4</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11446"><span>Gopher</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13169"><span>Pretrainer’s Guide</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01116"><span>RefinedWeb</span></a>, in addition to several signals described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03169"><span>other papers</span></a>. These annotations fall into the following categories:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Quality signals indicating how <strong>natural</strong> a given piece of text is. This includes simple heuristic measures such as the number of sentences, the number of words, the fraction of all-caps words, among others.</p></li><li><p>Quality signals indicating how <strong>repetitive</strong> a given piece of text is. Here follow the Gopher rules (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11446"><span>Rae et al.</span></a>) and compute the fraction of characters that appear in duplicated word n-grams and the fraction of characters in the most frequent word n-gram appearing in the documents.</p></li><li><p><strong>Content-based</strong> quality signals are comprised of signals that take the content into account such as the density of words appearing in a list of blocked words (similar to C4), or documents which come from a list of domains flagged as containing potentially harmful or otherwise offensive content.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>ML-based</strong> quality signals revolve around the idea of measuring how similar a given text is to a high-quality domain. Here we use fasttext classifiers trained on various high quality domains such as Wikipedia, as well as importance weights as proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03169"><span>Xie et al</span></a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deduplication</strong> signals with pre-computed Minhash signatures (with 128 permutations) which can be used for fuzzy deduplication at different degrees.</p></li></ul>

  <p>In addition to these minhash signatures, we conduct exact deduplication with a Bloom filter over the sha1 hash-digest of the document. These are stored as a separate quality annotation file to allow the original non-duplicated distribution to be recovered to facilitate research in this direction.</p><h3>Dataset Statistics</h3><p>RedPajama-v2 processed 84 CommonCrawl crawls and consists of 113B documents in the five languages (English, German, French, Spanish, and Italian). While we keep the tail partition of the resulting data, consisting of an estimated 80B documents, we also compute the number of documents and tokens for the head and middle partitions (before and after deduplication). Interestingly, while this reduces the token count by 60%, the number of documents decreases disproportionately more by 71%, indicating that the tail documents are generally shorter.</p>

<p>We further deduplicated the head+middle documents using a Bloom filter, which leads to a reduction in the dataset size by roughly 40%. In the following figure, we show the development of the number of documents in the head+middle partition, as a function of the point in time of the crawl. What stands out here is that there is a relatively stable number until 2018, and a significantly smaller number of documents between 2014 and 2016 (up to 10x for, e.g., German). It is also worth noting how the number of unique documents over time develops. Specifically, since we ran the deduplication from the newest snapshot to the oldest, one expects an increasingly smaller number of unique documents in the corpus, which can be observed from the figure below (note the log-scale). However, it is worth pointing out the sudden drop in unique documents occurring for the crawls between 2014 and 2017. We believe that this can be explained from a different list of seeds used by the CommonCrawl web crawler during that period.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Dataset Structure</h3><p>The core of the dataset is composed of the text documents, accompanied by the quality annotations and deduplication clusters. The structure largely follows the one defined by CCNet. Specifically, the documents for a given CommonCrawl snapshot (say, e.g., 2018-43) are partitioned into 5k shards where the key indicates the shard, language of the document, and the perplexity bucket (partition). The quality annotations and duplicates follow the same logic and “mirror” the source filenames:</p>

  <p>Since we have quality signals that can characterise the quality on a line level (e.g., whether a line ends in a terminal punctuation mark), or on a document level we choose the logic used by <a href="https://github.com/allenai/dolma"><span>Dolma</span></a>, allowing for a unified representation of different types of signals. Specifically, each score corresponds to an array of tuples `(start, end, score)` where start and end correspond to the span in the document string where the score “applies”.</p><h3>A “Living” Dataset</h3><p>We envision the release of this dataset to be the start of a larger, community-driven development of large-scale datasets for LLMs. Along the data axis, we hope to continuously grow this pool and enrich it with additional domains and new snapshots over time. Along the data quality side, we view the current set of quality signals as an initial base set of signals that we hope to grow with new additions. In that sense, RedPajama-v2 should be seen as a pool that grows over time as the community learns more about harnessing the data for training performant language models. In the future, we plan to add more quality annotations such as: Contamination annotations against popular LLM benchmarks, topic modelling and classification annotations for each document, and other annotations that the community is excited about!</p><h3>Model Building at Together</h3><p>Together is building open models based on RedPajama-Dataset-V2, and we also help companies and organizations build custom models built with principled mixes of open and their proprietary datasets.

     The Grug Brained Developer<br>
     <small>A layman's guide to thinking like the self-aware smol brained</small>
  </h2>
</div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>this collection of thoughts on software development gathered by grug brain developer</p>
<p>grug brain developer not so smart, but grug brain developer program many long year and learn some things
although mostly still confused</p>
<p>grug brain developer try collect learns into small, easily digestible and funny page, not only for you, the young grug, but also for him
because as grug brain developer get older he forget important things, like what had for breakfast or if put pants on</p>
<p>big brained developers are many, and some not expected to like this, make sour face</p>
<p><em>THINK</em> they are big brained developers many, many more, and more even definitely probably maybe not like this, many
sour face (such is internet)</p>
<p>(note: grug once think big brained but learn hard way)</p>
<p>is fine!</p>
<p>is free country sort of and end of day not really matter too much, but grug hope you fun reading and maybe learn from
many, many mistake grug make over long program life</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-complexity"></a><a href="#grug-on-complexity">The Eternal Enemy: Complexity</a></h2>
<p>apex predator of grug is complexity</p>
<p>complexity bad</p>
<p>say again:</p>
<p>complexity <em>very</em> bad</p>
<p><em>you</em> say now:</p>
<p>complexity <em>very</em>, <em>very</em> bad</p>
<p>given choice between complexity or one on one against t-rex, grug take t-rex: at least grug see t-rex</p>
<p>complexity is spirit demon that enter codebase through well-meaning but ultimately very clubbable non grug-brain
developers and project managers who not fear complexity spirit demon or even know about sometime</p>
<p>one day code base understandable and grug can get work done, everything good!</p>
<p>next day impossible: complexity demon spirit has entered code and very dangerous situation!</p>
<p>grug no able see complexity demon, but grug sense presence in code base</p>
<p>demon complexity spirit mocking him make change here break unrelated thing there what!?! mock mock mock ha ha so funny
grug love programming and not becoming shiney rock speculator like grug senior advise</p>
<p>club not work on demon spirit complexity and bad idea actually hit developer who let spirit in with club: sometimes grug
himself!</p>
<p>sadly, often grug himself</p>
<p>so grug say again and say often: complexity <em>very</em>, <em>very</em> bad</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-saying-no"></a><a href="#grug-on-saying-no">Saying No</a></h2>
<p>best weapon against complexity spirit demon is magic word: "no"</p>
<p>"no, grug not build that feature"</p>
<p>"no, grug not build that abstraction"</p>
<p>"no, grug not put water on body every day or drink less black think juice you stop repeat ask now"</p>
<p>note, this good engineering advice but bad career advice: "yes" is magic word for more shiney rock and put in
charge of large tribe of developer</p>
<p>sad but true: learn "yes" then learn blame other grugs when fail, ideal career advice</p>
<p>but grug must to grug be true, and "no" is magic grug word.  Hard say at first, especially if you nice grug and don't like
disappoint people (many such grugs!) but  easier over time even though shiney rock pile not as high as might otherwise be</p>
<p>is ok: how many shiney rock grug really need anyway?</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-saying-ok"></a><a href="#grug-on-saying-ok">Saying ok</a></h2>
<p>sometimes compromise necessary or no shiney rock, mean no dinosaur meat, not good, wife firmly remind grug
about young grugs at home need roof, food, and so forth, no interest in complexity demon spirit rant by grug for
fiftieth time</p>
<p>in this situation, grug recommend "ok"</p>
<p>"ok, grug build that feature"</p>
<p>then grug spend time think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20 solution</a> to problem and build that instead.<br>
80/20 solution say "80 want with 20 code"  solution maybe not have all bell-whistle that project manager want, maybe a
little ugly, but work and deliver most value, and keep demon complexity spirit at bay for most part to extent</p>
<p>sometimes probably best just not tell project manager and do it 80/20 way.  easier forgive than permission, project managers
mind like butterfly at times overworked and dealing with many grugs.  often forget what even feature supposed to do or move on or
quit or get fired grug see many such cases</p>
<p>anyway is in project managers best interest anyway so grug not to feel too bad for this approach usually</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-factring-your-code"></a><a href="#grug-on-factring-your-code">Factoring Your Code</a></h2>
<p>next strategy very harder: break code base up properly (fancy word: "factor your code properly")  here is hard give general
advice because each system so different.  however, one thing grug come to believe: not factor your application too early!</p>
<p>early on in project everything very abstract and like water: very little solid holds for grug's struggling brain to hang
on to.  take time to develop "shape" of system and learn what even doing.  grug try not to factor in early part of project
and then, at some point, good cut-points emerge from code base</p>
<p>good cut point has narrow interface with rest of system: small number of functions or abstractions that hide complexity
demon internally, like trapped in crystal</p>
<p>grug quite satisfied when complexity demon trapped properly in crystal, is best feeling to trap mortal enemy!</p>
<p>grug try watch patiently as cut points emerge from code and slowly refactor, with code base taking shape over time along
with experience.  no hard/ fast rule for this: grug know cut point when grug see cut point, just take time to build
skill in seeing, patience</p>
<p>sometimes grug go too early and get abstractions wrong, so grug bias towards waiting</p>
<p>big brain developers often not like this at all and invent many abstractions start of project</p>
<p>grug tempted to reach for club and yell "big brain no maintain code!  big brain move on next architecture committee
leave code for grug deal with!"</p>
<p>but grug learn control passions, major difference between grug and animal</p>
<p>instead grug try to limit damage of big brain developer early in project by giving them thing like
UML diagram (not hurt code, probably throw away anyway) or by demanding working demo tomorrow</p>
<p>working demo especially good trick: force big brain make something to actually work to talk about and code to look at that do
thing, will help big brain see reality on ground more quickly</p>
<p>remember!  big brain have big brain!  need only be harness for good and not in service of spirit complexity demon on
accident, many times seen</p>
<p>(best grug brain able to herd multiple big brain in right direction and produce many complexity demon trap crystals, large
shiney rock pile awaits such grug!)</p>
<p>also sometimes call demo approach "prototype", sound fancier to project manager</p>
<p>grug say prototype early in software making, <em>especially</em> if many big brains</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-testing"></a><a href="#grug-on-testing">Testing</a></h2>
<p>grug have love/hate relationship with test: test save grug many, many uncountable time and grug love and respect test</p>
<p>unfortunately also many test shamans exist.  some test shaman make test idol, demand things like "first test" before grug
even write code or have any idea what grug doing domain!</p>
<p>how grug test what grug not even understand domain yet!?</p>
<p>"Oh, don't worry: the tests will show you what you need to do."</p>
<p>grug once again catch grug slowly reaching for club, but grug stay calm</p>
<p>grug instead prefer write most tests after prototype phase, when code has begun firm up</p>
<p>but, note well: grug must here be very disciplined!</p>
<p>easy grug to move on and not write tests because "work on grugs machine"!</p>
<p>this very, very bad: no guarantee work on other machine and no guarantee work on grug machine in future, many times</p>
<p>test shaman have good point on importance of test, even if test shaman often sometimes not complete useful
feature in life and talk only about test all time, deserve of club but heart in right place</p>
<p>also, test shaman often talk unit test very much, but grug not find so useful.  grug experience that ideal tests are not
unit test or either end-to-end test, but in-between test</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit tests</a> fine, ok, but break as implementation change (much compared api!)
and make refactor hard and, frankly, many bugs anyway often due interactions other code.  often throw away when code change.</p>
<p>grug write unit test mostly at start of project, help get things going but not get too attached or expect value long time</p>
<p><a href="https://smartbear.com/solutions/end-to-end-testing/">end to end</a> tests good, show whole system work, but! hard to
understand when break and drive grug crazy very often, sometimes grugs just end up ignoring because "oh, that break all
time"  very bad!</p>
<p>in-between tests, grug hear shaman call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing">"integration tests"</a> sometime
often with sour look on face. but grug say integration test sweet spot according to grug: high level enough test correctness
of system, low level enough, with good debugger, easy to see what break</p>
<p>grug prefer some unit tests especially at start but not 100% all code test and definitely not "first test".  "test along
the way" work pretty well for grug, especially as grug figure things out</p>
<p>grug focus much ferocious integration test effort as cut point emerge and system stabilize!  cut point api hopefully stable
compared implementation and integration test remain valuable many long time, and easy debug</p>
<p>also small, well curated end-to-end test suite is created to be kept working religiously on pain of clubbing. focus of important
end-to-end test on most common UI features and few most important edge cases, but not too many or become impossible maintain
and then ignored</p>
<p>this ideal set of test to grug</p>
<p>you may not like, but this peak grug testing</p>
<p>also, grug dislike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">mocking</a> in test, prefer only when absolute necessary
to (rare/never) and coarse grain mocking (cut points/systems) only at that</p>
<p>one exception "first test" dislike by grug: when bug found.  grug always try first reproduce bug with regression test
<em>then</em> fix bug, this case only for some reason work better</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-agile"></a><a href="#grug-on-agile">Agile</a></h2>
<p>grug think agile not terrible, not good</p>
<p>end of day, not worst way to organize development, maybe better than others grug supposes is fine</p>
<p>danger, however, is agile shaman!  many, many shiney rock lost to agile shaman!</p>
<p>whenever agile project fail, agile shaman say "you didn't do agile right!"  grug note this awfully convenient for agile
shaman, ask more shiney rock better agile train young grugs on agile, danger!</p>
<p>grug tempted reach for club when too much agile talk happen but always stay calm</p>
<p>prototyping, tools and hiring good grugs better key to success software: agile process ok and help some but sometimes hurt taken
too seriously</p>
<p>grug say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">no silver club</a> fix all software problems no matter what agile
shaman say (danger!)</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-refactoring"></a><a href="#grug-on-refactoring">Refactoring</a></h2>
<p>refactoring fine activity and often good idea, especially later in project when code firmed up</p>
<p>however, grug note that many times in career "refactors" go horribly off rails and end up causing more harm than good</p>
<p>grug not sure exactly why some refactors work well, some fail, but grug notice that larger refactor, more
likely failure appear to be</p>
<p>so grug try to keep refactors relatively small and not be "too far out from shore" during refactor.  ideally system work
entire time and each step of finish before other begin.</p>
<p>end-to-end tests are life saver here, but often very hard understand why broke... such is refactor life.</p>
<p>also grug notice that introducing too much abstraction often lead to refactor failure and system failure.  good example
was <a href="https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/j2ee/">J2EE</a> introduce, many big brain sit around thinking too much abstraction, nothing good came of it many project hurt</p>
<p>another good example when company grug work for introduce <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/OSGi">OSGi</a> to help
manage/trap spriit complexity demon in code base.  not only OSGi not help, but make complexity demon much more powerful!
took multiple man year of best developers to rework as well to boot!  more complex spirit and now features impossible
implement! very bad!</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-chestertons-fence"></a><a href="#grug-on-chestertons-fence">Chesterton's Fence</a></h2>
<p>wise grug shaman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton">chesterton</a> once say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>here exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>many older grug learn this lesson well not start tearing code out willy nilly, no matter how ugly look</p>
<p>grug understand all programmer platonists at some level wish music of spheres perfection in code.  but danger is here,
world is ugly and gronky many times and so also must code be</p>
<p>humility not often come big brained or think big brained
easily or grug even, but grug often find "oh, grug no like look of this, grug fix" lead many hours pain grug and no better or system
worse even</p>
<p>grug early on in career often charge into code base waving club wildly and smash up everything, learn not good</p>
<p>grug not say no improve system ever, quite foolish, but recommend take time understand system first especially bigger system is and
is respect code working today even if not perfect</p>
<p>here tests often good hint for why fence not to be smashed!</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-microservices"></a><a href="#grug-on-microservices">Microservices</a></h2>
<p>grug wonder why big brain take hardest problem, factoring system correctly, and introduce network call too</p>
<p>seem very confusing to grug</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-tools"></a><a href="#grug-on-tools">Tools</a></h2>
<p>grug love tool.  tool and control passion what separate grug from dinosaurs!  tool allow grug brain to create code that
not possible otherwise by doing thinking for grug, always good relief! grug always spend time in new place learning
tools around him to maximize productivity: learn tools for two weeks make development often twice faster and often
have dig around ask other developers help, no docs</p>
<p>code completion in IDE allow grug not have remembered all API, very important!</p>
<p>java programming nearly impossible without it for grug!</p>
<p>really make grug think some time</p>
<p>good debugger worth weight in shiney rocks, in fact also more: when faced with bug grug would often trade all shiney rock and
perhaps few children for good debugger and anyway debugger no weigh anything far as grug can tell</p>
<p>grug always recommend new programmer learn available debugger very deeply, features like conditional break points, expression
evaluation, stack navigation, etc teach new grug more about computer than university class often!</p>
<p>grug say never be not improving tooling</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-type-systems"></a><a href="#grug-on-type-systems">Type Systems</a></h2>
<p>grug very like type systems make programming easier.  for grug, type systems most value when grug hit dot on keyboard and
list of things grug can do pop up magic.  this 90% of value of type system or more to grug</p>
<p>big brain type system shaman often say type correctness main point type system, but grug note some big brain type system
shaman not often ship code.  grug suppose code never shipped is correct, in some sense, but not really what grug mean
when say correct</p>
<p>grug say tool magic pop up of what can do and complete of code major most benefit of type system, correctness also good but not
so nearly so much</p>
<p>also, often sometimes caution beware big brains here!</p>
<p>some type big brain think in type systems and talk in lemmas, potential danger!</p>
<p>danger abstraction too high, big brain type system code become astral projection of platonic generic turing model of
computation into code base.  grug confused and agree some level very elegant but also very hard do anything like
record number of club inventory for Grug Inc. task at hand</p>
<p>generics especially dangerous here, grug try limit generics to container classes for most part where most value add</p>
<p>temptation generics very large is trick!  spirit demon complex love this one trick! beware!</p>
<p>always most value type system come: hit dot see what grug can do, never forget!</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-expression-complexity"></a><a href="#grug-on-expression-complexity">Expression Complexity</a></h2>
<p>grug once like to minimize lines of code much as possible.  write code like this:</p>
<pre><code>  if(contact &amp;&amp; !contact.isActive() &amp;&amp; (contact.inGroup(FAMILY) || contact.inGroup(FRIENDS))) {
    // ...
  }
</code></pre>
<p>over time grug learn this hard debug, learn prefer write like so:</p>
<pre><code>  if(contact) {
    var contactIsInactive = !contact.isActive();
    var contactIsFamilyOrFriends = contact.inGroup(FAMILY) || contact.inGroup(FRIENDS);
    if(contactIsInactive &amp;&amp; contactIsFamilyOrFriends) {
        // ...
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>grug hear screams from young grugs at horror of many line of code and pointless variable and grug prepare defend self with club</p>
<p>club fight start with other developers attack and grug yell: "easier debug!  see result of each expression more clearly and good name!  easier
understand conditional expression!  EASIER DEBUG!"</p>
<p>definitely easier debug and once club fight end calm down and young grug think a bit, they realize grug right</p>
<p>grug still catch grug writing code like first example and often regret, so grug not judge young grug</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-dry"></a><a href="#grug-on-dry">DRY</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> mean Don't Repeat Self, powerful maxim over mind of most
developers</p>
<p>grug respect DRY and good advice, however grug recommend balance in all things, as gruggest big brain aristotle recommend</p>
<p>grug note humourous graph by Lea Verou correspond with grug passion not repeat:</p>
<img alt="code concerns over time" src="https://grugbrain.dev/over-time.png">
<p>over time past ten years program grug not as concerned repeat code.  so long as repeat code simple enough and obvious
enough, and grug begin feel repeat/copy paste code with small variation is better than many callback/closures passed arguments
or elaborate object model: too hard complex for too little benefit at times</p>
<p>hard balance here, repeat code always still make grug stare and say "mmm" often, but experience show repeat code
sometimes often better than complex DRY solution</p>
<p>note well!  grug encourage over literal developer not take does work line too serious, is joke</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-soc"></a><a href="#grug-on-soc">Separation of Concerns (SoC)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">Separation of Concern (SoC)</a> another powerful idea over many developer
mind, idea to separate different aspects of system into distinct sections code</p>
<p>canonical example from web development: separation of style (css file), markup (html file) and logic (javascript file)</p>
<p>here grug much more sour faced than DRY and in fact write big brained essay on alternative design principle
<a href="https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/">locality of behavior (LoB)</a> against SoC</p>
<p>grug much prefer put code on the thing that do the thing.  now when grug look at the thing grug know the thing what the
thing do, alwasy good relief!</p>
<p>when separate of concern grug must often all over tarnation many file look understand what how button do, much confuse
and time waste: bad!</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-closures"></a><a href="#grug-on-closures">Closures</a></h2>
<p>grug like closures for right job and that job usually abstracting operation over collection of objects</p>
<p>grug warn closures like salt, type systems and generics: small amount go long way, but easy spoil things too much use
give heart attack</p>
<p>javascript developers call very special complexity demon spirit in javascript "callback hell" because too much closure
used by javascript libraries very sad but also javascript developer get what deserved let grug be frank</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-logging"></a><a href="#grug-on-logging">Logging</a></h2>
<p>grug huge fan of logging and encourage lots of it, especially in cloud deployed.  some non-grugs say logging expensive
and not important.  grug used think this way no more</p>
<p>funny story: grug learn idol <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike">rob pike</a> working on logging at google and decide:
"if rob pike working on logging, what grug do there?!?" so not pursue.  turn out logging <em>very</em> important to google so
of course best programmer work on it, grug!</p>
<p>don't be such grug brain, grug, much less shiney rock now!</p>
<p>oh well, grug end up at good company anyway and rob pike dress habit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KINIAgRpkDA">increasingly erratic</a>, so all work out in end, but
point stand: logging very important!</p>
<p>grug tips on logging are:</p>
<ul>
<li>log all major logical branches within code (if/for)</li>
<li>if "request" span multiple machine in cloud infrastructure, include request ID in all so logs can be grouped</li>
<li>if possible make log level dynamically controlled, so grug can turn on/off when need debug issue (many!)</li>
<li>if possible make log level per user, so can debug specific user issue</li>
</ul>
<p>last two points are especially handy club when fighting bugs in production systems very often</p>
<p>unfortunately log libraries often very complex (java, <a href="https://stackify.com/logging-java/">why you do?</a>) but worth investing
time in getting logging infrastructure "just right" pay off big later in grug experience</p>
<p>logging need taught more in schools, grug think</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-concurrency"></a><a href="#grug-on-concurrency">Concurrency</a></h2>
<p>grug, like all sane developer, fear concurrency</p>
<p>as much as possible, grug try to rely on simple concurrency models like stateless web request handlers and simple
remote job worker queues where jobs no interdepend and simple api</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control">optimistic concurrency</a> seem work well for web stuff</p>
<p>occasionally grug reach for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage">thread local variable</a>, usually when
writing framework code</p>
<p>some language have good concurrent data structure, like java <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html">ConcurrentHashMap</a>
but still need careful grug work to get right</p>
<p>grug has never used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)">erlang</a>, hear good things, but language
look wierd to grug sorry</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-optimizing"></a><a href="#grug-on-optimizing">Optimizing</a></h2>
<p>ultra biggest of brain developer once say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>premature optimization is the root of all evil</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this everyone mostly know and grug in humble violent agreement with ultra biggest of big brain</p>
<p>grug recommend always to have concrete, real world perf profile showing specific perf issue before begin optimizing.</p>
<p>never know what actual issue might be, grug often surprise!  very often!</p>
<p>beware only cpu focus: easy to see cpu and much big o notation thinking having been done in school,
but often not root of all slowness, surprise to many including grug</p>
<p>hitting network equivalent of many, many millions cpu cycle and always to be minimized if possible, note well big brain
microservice developer!</p>
<p>inexperienced big brain developer see nested loop and often say "O(n^2)?  Not on my watch!"</p>
<p>complexity demon spirit smile</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-apis"></a><a href="#grug-on-apis">APIs</a></h2>
<p>grug love good apis.  good apis not make grug think too much</p>
<p>unfortunately, many apis very bad, make grug think quite a bit.  this happen many reasons, here two:</p>
<ul>
<li>API creators think in terms of implementation or domain of API, rather than in terms of use of API</li>
<li>API creators think too abstract and big brained</li>
</ul>
<p>usually grug not care too deeply about detail of api: want write file or sort list or whatever, just want to call
<code>write()</code> or <code>sort()</code> or whatever</p>
<p>but big brain api developers say:</p>
<p>"not so fast, grug!  is that file <em>open for write</em>? did you define a <em>Comparator</em> for that sort?"</p>
<p>grug find self restraining hand reaching for club again</p>
<p>not care about that stuff right now, just want sort and write file mr big brain!</p>
<p>grug recognize that big brain api designer have point and that <em>sometime</em> these things matter, but often do not.
big brain api developers better if design for simple cases with simple api, make complex cases possible
with more complex api</p>
<p>grug call this "layering" apis: two or three different apis at different level complexity for various grug needs</p>
<p>also, if object oriented, put api on thing instead of elsewhere. java worst at this!</p>
<p>grug want filter list in java</p>
<p>"Did you convert it to a stream?"</p>
<p>fine, grug convert to stream</p>
<p>"OK, now you can filter."</p>
<p>OK, but now need return list!  have stream!</p>
<p>"Well, did you collect your stream into a list?"</p>
<p>what?</p>
<p>"Define a Collector&lt;? super T, A, R&gt; to collect your stream into a list"</p>
<p>grug now swear on ancestor grave he club every single person in room, but count two instead and remain calm</p>
<p>put common thing like <code>filter()</code> on list and make return list, listen well big brain java api developer!</p>
<p>nobody care about "stream" or even hear of "stream" before, is not networking api, all java grugs use list mr big brain!</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-parsing"></a><a href="#grug-on-parsing">Parsing</a></h2>
<p>grug love make programming language at drop of hat and
say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive descent</a>
most fun and beautiful way create parser</p>
<p>unfortunately many big brain school teach only parser generator tool.  here grug usual love of tool is not: parser
generator tool generate code of awful snakes nest: impossible understand, bottom up, what?  hide recursive nature of
grammar from grug and debug impossible, very bad according grug!</p>
<p>grug think this because while complexity demon bad for code base and understand, complexity demon very good for generation
of much academic papers, sad but true</p>
<p>production parser almost always recursive descent, despite ignore by schools!  grug furious when learn how simple parse
is! parsing not big brain only magic: so can you!</p>
<p>grug very elated find big brain developer Bob Nystrom redeem the big brain tribe and write excellent book on recursive
descent: <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a></p>
<p>book available online free, but grug highly recommend all interested grugs purchase book on general principle, provide
much big brain advice and grug love book <em>very</em> much except visitor pattern (trap!)</p>

<p>some non-grugs, when faced with web development say:</p>
<p>"I know, I'll split my front end and back end codebase up and use a hot new SPA library talking to a GraphQL JSON API back end
over HTTP (which is funny because I'm not transferring hypertext)"</p>
<p>now you have two complexity demon spirit lairs</p>
<p>and, what is worse, front end complexity demon spirit even more powerful and have deep spiritual hold on entire front end
industry as far as grug can tell</p>
<p>back end developers try keep things simple and can work ok, but front end developers make very complex very quickly and
introduce lots of code, demon complex spirit</p>
<p>even when website just need put form into database or simple brochure site!</p>
<p>everyone do this now!</p>
<p>grug not sure why except maybe facebook and google say so, but that not seem very good reason to grug</p>
<p>grug not like big complex front end libraries everyone use</p>
<p>grug make <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> and <a href="https://hyperscript.org/">hyperscript</a> to avoid</p>
<p>keep complexity low, simple HTML, avoid lots javascript, the natural ether of spirit complexity demon</p>
<p>maybe they work for you, but no job post, sorry</p>
<p>react better for job and also some type application, but also you become alcolyte of complexity demon whether you like
or no, sorry such is front end life</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-fads"></a><a href="#grug-on-fads">Fads</a></h2>
<p>grug note lots of fads in development, especially front end development today</p>
<p>back end better more boring because all bad ideas have tried at this point maybe (still retry some!)</p>
<p>still trying all bad ideas in front end development so still much change and hard to know</p>
<p>grug recommend taking all revolutionary new approach with grain salt: big brains have working for long
time on computers now, most ideas have tried at least once</p>
<p>grug not saying can't learn new tricks or no good new ideas, but also much of time wasted on recycled bad ideas, lots of
spirit complexity demon power come from putting new idea willy nilly into code base</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-fold"></a><a href="#grug-on-fold">Fear Of Looking Dumb</a></h2>
<p>note!  very good if senior grug willing to say publicly: "hmmm, this too complex for grug"!</p>
<p>many developers Fear Of Looking Dumb (FOLD), grug also at one time FOLD, but grug learn get over: very important senior
grug say "this too complicated and confuse to me"</p>
<p>this make it ok for junior grugs to admit too complex and not understand as well, often such case!  FOLD major source of
complexity demon power over developer, especially young grugs!</p>
<p>take FOLD power away, very good of senior grug!</p>
<p>note: important to make thinking face and look big brained when saying though.  be prepare for big brain or, worse and
much more common, <em>thinks</em> is big brain to make snide remark of grug</p>
<p>be strong! no FOLD!</p>
<p>club sometimes useful here, but more often sense of humor and especially last failed project by big brain very useful,

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h2>Complaint alleges software company misled investors about its cybersecurity practices and known risks</h2></p><p>
          Washington D.C.,           Oct. 30, 2023 —
        </p><div><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Austin, Texas-based software company SolarWinds Corporation and its chief information security officer, Timothy G. Brown, for fraud and internal control failures relating to allegedly known cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities. The complaint alleges that, from at least its October 2018 initial public offering through at least its December 2020 announcement that it was the target of a massive, nearly two-year long cyberattack, dubbed “SUNBURST,” SolarWinds and Brown defrauded investors by overstating SolarWinds' cybersecurity practices and understating or failing to disclose known risks.&nbsp;In its filings with the SEC during this period, SolarWinds allegedly misled investors by disclosing only generic and hypothetical risks at a time when the company and Brown knew of specific deficiencies in SolarWinds’ cybersecurity practices as well as the increasingly elevated risks the company faced at the same time.</p>

<p>As the complaint alleges, SolarWinds’ public statements about its cybersecurity practices and risks were at odds with its internal assessments, including a 2018 presentation prepared by a company engineer and shared internally, including with Brown, that SolarWinds’ remote access set-up was “not very secure” and that someone exploiting the vulnerability “can basically do whatever without us detecting it until it’s too late,” which could lead to “major reputation and financial loss” for SolarWinds. Similarly, as alleged in the SEC’s complaint, 2018 and 2019 presentations by Brown stated, respectively, that the “current state of security leaves us in a very vulnerable state for our critical assets” and that “[a]ccess and privilege to critical systems/data is inappropriate.”</p>

<p>In addition, the SEC’s complaint alleges that multiple communications among SolarWinds employees, including Brown, throughout 2019 and 2020 questioned the company’s ability to protect its critical assets from cyberattacks. For example, according to the SEC’s complaint, in June 2020, while investigating a cyberattack on a SolarWinds customer, Brown wrote that it was “very concerning” that the attacker may have been looking to use SolarWinds’ Orion software in larger attacks because “our backends are not that resilient;” and a September 2020 internal document shared with Brown and others stated, “the volume of security issues being identified over the last month have [sic] outstripped the capacity of Engineering teams to resolve.”</p>

<p>The SEC’s complaint alleges that Brown was aware of SolarWinds’ cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities but failed to resolve the issues or, at times, sufficiently raise them further within the company. As a result of these lapses, the company allegedly also could not provide reasonable assurances that its most valuable assets, including its flagship Orion product, were adequately protected.</p>

<p>SolarWinds made an incomplete disclosure about the SUNBURST attack in a December 14, 2020, Form 8-K filing, following which its stock price dropped approximately 25 percent over the next two days and approximately 35 percent by the end of the month.</p>

<p>“We allege that, for years, SolarWinds and Brown ignored repeated red flags about SolarWinds’ cyber risks, which were well known throughout the company and led one of Brown’s subordinates to conclude: ‘We’re so far from being a security minded company,’” said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “Rather than address these vulnerabilities, SolarWinds and Brown engaged in a campaign to paint a false picture of the company’s cyber controls environment, thereby depriving investors of accurate material information. Today’s enforcement action not only charges SolarWinds and Brown for misleading the investing public and failing to protect the company’s ‘crown jewel’ assets, but also underscores our message to issuers: implement strong controls calibrated to your risk environments and level with investors about known concerns.”</p>

<p>The SEC’s complaint, filed in the Southern District of New York, alleges that SolarWinds and Brown violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; SolarWinds violated reporting and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act; and Brown aided and abetted the company’s violations. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer and director bar against Brown.</p>

<p>The SEC’s investigation was conducted by W. Bradley Ney, Lory Stone, and Benjamin Brutlag, with assistance from the Trial Unit’s Christopher Bruckmann and Kristen Warden, and was supervised by Carolyn M. Welshhans and Melissa R. Hodgman. The SEC’s litigation will be led by Mr. Bruckmann and Ms. Warden under the supervision of Melissa Armstrong.</p>
