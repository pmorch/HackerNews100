<p>SIM-swap attacks continue year after year because companies (that know better) <em>leaned into</em> the awful idea of using SMS for password resets and account logins. These companies include Apple, Dropbox, PayPal, Block, Google, and many others.</p>



<p>What is a SIM-swap attack? It’s where a bad guy asks a carrier to port your cell-phone number to their phone. (Carriers are required to port your number easily because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_number_portability#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%2047,Federal%20Communications%20Commission%20(FCC).">pro-competition laws in the US</a>.) Then, the crook triggers and receives account login info via SMSes from companies and proceeds to steal money and sensitive info from the victim. It happens all the time… Here are just <a href="https://techmeme.com/search/query?q=sim&amp;wm=false">a few of the higher profile instances</a>:</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="988" height="1024" src="https://keydiscussions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/smsswap-988x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://keydiscussions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/smsswap-988x1024.png 988w, https://keydiscussions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/smsswap-289x300.png 289w, https://keydiscussions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/smsswap-768x796.png 768w, https://keydiscussions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/smsswap-1482x1536.png 1482w, https://keydiscussions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/smsswap-1976x2048.png 1976w, https://keydiscussions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/smsswap-982x1018.png 982w, https://keydiscussions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/smsswap-386x400.png 386w" sizes="(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px"></figure>



<p>Is there a way to stop SIM swap attacks? Yes, it’s simple: Companies SHOULD NOT LET CUSTOMERS LOG IN via SMS, or allow password resetting via SMS. If SMS 2FA is offered, it should <strong><em>only</em> be</strong> if they provide more secure options like Authy or Google Authenticator (and SMS should not serve as a fallback for account recovery).</p>



<p>For many years, people in the industry have invariably said something like: “Well… offering SMS-based authentication is better *overall* for customer security, because of its <em>convenience</em> (despite its shortcomings) vs other methods” (such as the far-more secure-able use of email for verification).  To that I say: “who are *YOU* to deprive your customers of security?” Defending against targeted attacks must be an integral part of any company’s defense posture. It’s so arrogant to say otherwise, and it boils my blood, it really does. Offering SMS-based logins is a bad idea, and it never had a chance of being a good one. </p>



<p>Sending an SMS to a customer is like sending a postcard through the mail. It’s plaintext (not encrypted), and anyone can open your mailbox and intercept/read it (which is what happens in a SIM-swap attack). The protocol was never designed to be secure.</p>



<p>Is SMS the best option for password resets? NO! Reseting passwords via an email is far more secure. Is SMS a good 2FA option? No! Apps like Authy or using email is better. Is logging your customer in via SMS ever acceptable? No! [After reading Hacker News comments, let me be clear – I’m not <em>just</em> talking about SMS 2FA, in fact I’m primarily talking about the ubiquitous state of SMS-based password reseting, user onboarding, and account recovery. All are varying degrees of weak. SMS-based 2FA is, when offered as an option alongside stronger 2FA, the least bad of the weak-security scenarios but is not the focus of the post.]</p>



<p>Much of the ire relating to SIM-swap attacks has, understandably, been directed at carriers. Indeed, carriers do a terrible job of securing customers’ phone numbers, and <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/190723/p15#a190723p15">may be liable for that shortcoming</a>. But here’s the thing: carriers’ security <em>has always</em> been bad, it has even been legislated into being bad, and other companies have still <strong>chosen</strong> to build mission-critical systems on top of that weak link.</p>



<p>Despite it being commonplace, it is important to remember that baking SMS into authentication flows was an awful, shortsighted <strong><em>choice</em></strong> made by companies. Despite offering poor security, SMS offers a nearly frictionless way to sign up new customers (think of Uber’s onboarding) and handle password resets, and companies felt they had to match competitors’ adoption of this technique. They dug the hole, pushed us in, and now they must get us out.</p>



<p>Companies adopt the naive outlook that, somehow, crooks won’t try hard enough to SIM swap individuals. Clearly the criminals will – even to the point of <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/240130/p39#a240130p39">pretending to be customers at physical store locations</a>. It’s time for them to call it on this experiment. It failed.</p>



<p>And I’m sorry, but after nearly a decade, we can call it: efforts to strengthen telephony protocols like SHAKEN/STIR, will never happen. If the willpower had existed in the industry, it would have happened 5 years ago. Promises of protocol upgrades never were (and certainly are not now) a satisfactory excuse to continue to send password reset codes over SMS. Nor would a stronger protocol even stop SIM swap attacks. People are being harmed day-in and day-out, while the industry equivocates. </p>



<p>While SIM-swapping attacks are prevalent and headline-grabbing, SMSes are also vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. These are likely carried out frequently by nation states. The fact that nation states can abuse SMS verification may even explain some of the overall inertia in allowing a broken system to remain.</p>



<p>If I sound heated, it’s because I’ve been banging this drum for over 7 years. Others <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2020/10/11/apple-iphone-imessage-and-android-messages-sms-passcode-security-update/">have written</a> about it years ago, and yet SIM-swap attacks continue unabated. I’m frustrated because many of these companies talk a big game about putting their customers’ safety and security first. I’m mad because, with all the intractable problems facing tech nowadays like deepfakes (including audio deepfakes that <a href="https://keydiscussions.com/2021/12/07/despite-the-prevalence-of-deepfake-audio-tech-banks-and-isps-rush-ahead-with-voice-print-authentication-%f0%9f%92%80/">I wrote about here</a>) and disinformation, this is one that <em>can actually be solved</em>, and yet nothing (concrete) is being done. We need a win, and here’s one for the taking!</p>



<p>To repeat: If some random person convinces T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Verizon, etc to port my number, MY DIGITAL SAFETY SHOULD NOT BE PORTED AS WELL.</p>



<h2>How companies embraced this broken tech</h2>



<p><strong>Apple</strong>:</p>



<p>Apple helped seal SMS’ role in password resets and account logins via its keyboard feature it announced in 2018: <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/automatically-fill-in-sms-passcodes-iphc89a3a3af/ios">Automatically fill in SMS passcodes on iPhone</a> . It also allows scenarios where SMS <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerDailey/status/855190987370618881">can be used</a> to reset your Apple account. </p>



<p><strong>Google</strong>:</p>



<p>In 2019, Google followed Apple’s bad idea with the same thing for Android, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-play-services-sms-code-auto-fill/">SMS autofill</a> for one time codes.</p>



<p><strong>Cloud providers like Twilio/Amazon/Microsoft/Google etc</strong>:</p>



<p>There is a large industrial complex behind SMS codes. Many companies have profit incentives to continue offering SMS one time codes to customers.   <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/generally-available-azure-communication-services-short-code-functionality-for-sms/">Azure</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/send-validate-otp.html">AWS</a>, <a href="https://www.twilio.com/en-us/pricing">Twilio</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+cloud+sms+codes&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS975US978&amp;oq=google+cloud+sms+codes&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRhA0gEINTY2M2owajSoAgCwAgA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Google</a>, etc. Selling these services is unethical.  It’s a fundamentally broken technology, sold as a secure solution.<br></p>



<p><strong>Money management services</strong></p>



<p>Unbelievably, SMS reset/account login functionality is completely ubiquitous even when it comes to your money: <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/privacy-security/advanced-access/">Wells Fargo</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/f0cuyq/cash_app_texting_me_with_signin_code_out_of_the/">Cash App (Block)</a>, <a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/verifying-its-you/">Robinhood</a>, <a href="https://www.schwab.com/legal/deviceid">Schwab</a>, <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/cshelp/article/what-can-i-do-if-ive-changed-my-mobile-number-and-cant-log-in-help678">Paypal</a>, etc etc. Again, these are SMS options offered as a way of “verifying that it’s you”, something that SIM-swapping crooks love to hear. Also, never <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/cshelp/article/what-can-i-do-if-ive-changed-my-mobile-number-and-cant-log-in-help678">carelessly change</a> your phone number, you’ll be locked out of your PayPal!</p>



<p><strong>Basically every</strong> other company at this point:</p>



<p>From food ordering services to <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/240122/p18#a240122p18">social <strong>networks</strong></a> and even data storage firms like <a href="https://help.dropbox.com/account-access/enable-two-step-verification"><strong>Dropbox</strong></a> — SMS is unfortunately, by default, a way to reset your account. If there’s even a way to turn it off, it’s incumbent upon <em>you the user</em>, to go in and opt out –service by service– and disable the crappy tech. Many services don’t offer an opt out.</p>



<h2>Customers think they like SMS reset options</h2>



<p>Customers don’t understand the broken nature of SMS resets. It’s not their job to. They appreciate that it’s more convenient than resets via email (an actually-secure option) or log in codes via 2FA apps like authenticator. iPhone’s SMS autofill is oftentimes (dubiously) <a href="https://journa.host/deck/@spencerdailey/111585692105278478">heralded</a> as the best thing in iOS. The issue is: it’s not the customer’s job to understand whether systems are secure, it’s tech companies’. </p>



<p>And tech companies have failed, leaving all of their customers exposed in the process. </p>



<p>Hopefully a combination of lawsuits and legislation will eventually change the status quo. In the meantime, <strong>companies need to be brave</strong> and call the situation for what it is: a complete shit show. And then roll back their support of SMS verification services.</p>



<h2><strong>A few more things:</strong> </h2>



<p><strong>Robust Identity services are more important than ever in the age of deepfakes.</strong></p>



<p>Moving away from telephone-number-based identity services is a major and necessary step in realizing robust means of customer identification, which is even more important these days. The era of old school KYC (Know Your Customer) enforcement is over, <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-underground-site-where-ai-neural-networks-churns-out-fake-ids-onlyfake/">with fake ID AI services going mainstream</a>. We should move away from unencrypted, SIM-swap-prone verification identity services like SMS.</p>



<p><strong>Many ransomware attacks are downstream of SIM-swap attacks</strong></p>



<p>Another seemingly intractable problem facing IT around the world is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/5/24059486/ransomware-victims-palo-alto-networks-unit-42">ransomware</a>. SIM-swapping attacks represent a significant vector for compromising a company’s network. Again, rolling back support for SMS logins could take a bite out of the ransomware scourge.</p>



<p><strong>One <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39269643">HN commenter mentioned</a> the <a href="https://www.sfrpay.fr/Nos-solutions/Mobile-ID/SIM-Verify">“SIM Verify” initiative in the EU</a>, </strong>where companies relying on SMS can at least check to see if a SIM had recently been ported. That’s something, and we’ll see if it goes anywhere, but if the SHAKEN/STIR rollout has taught me anything, changes like this may happen in a decade not a year.</p>



<p><strong>Finally, a dedicated home to this question</strong></p>



<p>I <a href="https://www.metafruit.com/smssecurity/">created a site at a permanent URL</a> that bluntly answers the question “Is using SMS for logins a good idea?”, for sharing with people in the industry.</p>

Effectively, I was “fired” for being too effective in my previous role.<o:p></o:p></p><p>I joined the startup hedge fund last year. In the short period while I worked there, I built an order management system which allowed the firm to make its first eve trades.

I know the job market is tough right now, but have I snookered myself and made myself unemployable for working too effectively during my last role?&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p><p>I think I have applied to every hedge fund and investment bank in London. My applications either received an automatic rejection, or simply no response in the majority of cases. In the handful of cases where I have been offered an interview, most have been initial conversations, followed by radio silence – not even a rejection email.<o:p></o:p></p><p>It seems that during such a dire economy, the dream of a junior quant role is out of reach, for now.

<p>Five tropical cyclones in the past 9 years have hit wind speeds far above the category 5 threshold, causing thousands of fatalities and billions of dollars of damage. Such ultrastrong, highly destructive hurricanes are becoming more likely as climate change increases the amount of energy available to storms.&nbsp;</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>“Storms are getting stronger and stronger, so category 5 underestimates actual risk.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2308901121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new study</a> published in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</em>, scientists suggest that the growing intensification of tropical cyclones may necessitate adding a sixth category to the <a href="https://www.weather.gov/hgx/tropical_scale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale</a>. Doing so could be one useful tool not only to indicate hurricane risk but also to convey the increasing dangers of climate change.</p>

<p>“Storms are getting stronger and stronger, so category 5 underestimates actual risk,” said <a href="https://experts.news.wisc.edu/experts/james-kossin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Kossin</a>, an author on the paper and an atmospheric scientist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.</p>


<h3>Warming Winds</h3>

<p>The Saffir-Simpson scale is the most widely recognized hurricane intensity scale, ranking storms from “tropical depression,” at wind speeds less than 38 miles per hour (61 kilometers per hour), to “category 5 hurricane,” at wind speeds greater than 157 miles per hour (253 kilometers per hour).</p>

<p>That scale may <a href="https://eos.org/articles/probing-the-power-of-pacific-supertyphoons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not capture the risk posed by the most intense storms</a> as the world warms, the authors wrote. They suggest a sixth category that encompasses storms with winds greater than 192 miles per hour (309 kilometers per hour).</p>

<p>The authors used three lines of evidence to support the creation of a sixth category. First, multiple storms have already spilled over into the hypothetical category 6. <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/2013-state-climate-record-breaking-super-typhoon-haiyan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Typhoon Haiyan</a>, for example, made landfall in the Philippines in 2013 and had winds that reached 195 miles per hour (314 kilometers per hour). Haiyan was the costliest storm ever to hit the country and one of the deadliest, causing more than 6,000 fatalities. In 2015, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Patricia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hurricane Patricia</a>—considered the strongest hurricane ever recorded—brought winds of up to 215 miles per hour (346 kilometers per hour) to southwest Mexico.</p>

<p>Climate change has likely contributed to the intensification of tropical storms, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter11.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>, the United Nations body that assesses climate science.</p>

<p>The authors also analyzed the maximum potential intensity of storms in recent decades. That metric refers to the highest wind speeds that are possible on a given day given that day’s weather conditions. They found that in the Gulf of Mexico between 1979 and 2019, conditions were conducive to category 6 hurricanes about 10 days a year.</p>

<p>The number of days conducive to category 6 wind speeds has increased because of climate change, said Kossin.</p>

<p>Last, the authors modeled future hurricanes under various climate change scenarios and found that under each possible scenario, the risk of a category 6 hurricane increased. “Over the next decade, there will be category 6 [hurricanes],” said <a href="https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/amcr/computational-science-dept/acsd/staff/staff-members/michael-wehner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Wehner</a>, an author on the paper and a climate scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.</p>

<h3>Communicating Climate Change</h3>

<p>Communication of risks shouldn’t focus only on the Saffir-Simpson scale, according to <a href="https://www.weather.gov/organization/michael-brennan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Brennan</a>, the director of NOAA’s National Hurricane Center (NHC). Most fatalities caused by hurricanes occur not from wind but from water, including storm surges and rain.</p>

<p>“At NHC, we’ve tried to steer the focus toward the individual hazards, which include storm surge, wind, rainfall, tornadoes and rip currents, instead of the particular category of the storm,” he wrote in an email. “Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale already captures ‘Catastrophic Damage’ from wind, so it’s not clear that there would be a need for another category even if storms were to get stronger.”</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>“The reality is that hurricanes have changed already. This creates the need to discuss whether the systems that we currently have in place are adequate for the future.”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>The question of whether a category 6 would be an effective communication tool requires a larger discussion, with input from social scientists, psychologists, emergency managers, and city planners, Kossin said. He said he hopes the idea of a hypothetical category 6 will spark more discussion of how to warn people about all hurricane-related risks, including wind, storm surge, and rainfall, as hurricanes continue to intensify.</p>

<p>“What we’re trying to highlight is not the immediate danger of an impending storm,” Wehner said. “That kind of thing is already out there. What we’re trying to communicate is that the risk of the most intense storms is increasing because of climate change.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/somas/people/_profiles/kevin-reed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Reed</a>, a climate and atmospheric scientist at Stony Brook University who was not involved in the new study, said that expanding the Saffir-Simpson scale would not only indicate increased risks from individual storms but highlight the worsening risks of climate change in general.</p>

<p>“The reality is that hurricanes have changed already,” Reed said. “This creates the need to discuss whether the systems that we currently have in place are adequate for the future.”</p>

    CUT MY LIST IN TWO PIECES
    THAT'S HOW YOU START QUICK SORT

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

We discovered a memory corruption in the glibc's qsort() function, due
to a missing bounds check. To be vulnerable, a program must call qsort()
with a nontransitive comparison function (a function cmp(int a, int b)
that returns (a - b), for example) and with a large number of attacker-
controlled elements (to cause a malloc() failure inside qsort()). We
have not tried to find such a vulnerable program in the real world.

All glibc versions from at least September 1992 (glibc 1.04) to the
current release (glibc 2.38) are affected, but the glibc's developers
have independently discovered and patched this memory corruption in the
master branch (commit b9390ba, "stdlib: Fix array bounds protection in
insertion sort phase of qsort") during a recent refactoring of qsort().

About our advisory, the glibc security team issues the following
statement:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
This memory corruption in the GNU C Library through the qsort function is
invoked by an application passing a non-transitive comparison function, which
is undefined according to POSIX and ISO C standards.  As a result, we are of
the opinion that the resulting CVE, if any, should be assigned to any such
calling applications and subsequently fixed by passing a valid comparison
function to qsort and not to glibc.  We however acknowledge that this is a
quality of implementation issue and we fixed this in a recent refactor of
qsort.  We would like to thank Qualys for sharing their findings and helping
us validate our recent changes to qsort.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


========================================================================
Background
========================================================================

While browsing through Postfix's HISTORY file, we stumbled across a
puzzling entry from February 2002:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Bugfix: make all recipient comparisons transitive, because
        Solaris qsort() causes SIGSEGV errors otherwise. Victor
        Duchovni, Morgan Stanley. File: *qmgr/qmgr_message.c.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Segmentation faults in qsort()? Transitive comparison functions?

As explained in the manual page for qsort(), "The comparison function
must return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the
first argument is considered to be respectively less than, equal to, or
greater than the second." Of course, such a comparison function cmp()
must be transitive:

- if a &lt; b (i.e., if cmp(pointer_to(a), pointer_to(b)) &lt; 0);

- and if b &lt; c (i.e., if cmp(pointer_to(b), pointer_to(c)) &lt; 0);

- then necessarily a &lt; c (i.e., cmp(pointer_to(a), pointer_to(c)) &lt; 0).

For example, the following comparison function (which compares integers)
is transitive (and perfectly correct):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
int
cmp(const void * const pa, const void * const pb)
{
    const int a = *(const int *)pa;
    const int b = *(const int *)pb;
    if (a &gt; b) return +1;
    if (a &lt; b) return -1;
    return 0;
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A shorter and more efficient version of this comparison function could
simply "return (a &gt; b) - (a &lt; b);" and still be transitive and perfectly
correct:

- if a &gt; b, it returns 1 - 0 = +1;

- if a &lt; b, it returns 0 - 1 = -1;

- if a = b, it returns 0 - 0 = 0.

The question, then, is: how can a comparison function be nontransitive?
A comparison function cmp() is nontransitive if there exist a, b, and c
such that:

- a &lt; b (because cmp(pointer_to(a), pointer_to(b)) &lt; 0);

- b &lt; c (because cmp(pointer_to(b), pointer_to(c)) &lt; 0);

- but a &gt;= c (because cmp(pointer_to(a), pointer_to(c)) &gt;= 0 by
  mistake).

Although the following comparison function seems correct at first, it is
in fact nontransitive, because the subtraction in "return (a - b);" is
prone to integer overflows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
int
cmp(const void * const pa, const void * const pb)
{
    const int a = *(const int *)pa;
    const int b = *(const int *)pb;
    return (a - b);
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, if a = INT_MIN, b = 0, and c = INT_MAX, then:

- a &lt; b (because cmp(pointer_to(a), pointer_to(b)) returns INT_MIN - 0,
  which is correctly negative);

- b &lt; c (because cmp(pointer_to(b), pointer_to(c)) returns 0 - INT_MAX,
  which is also correctly negative);

- but a &gt; c by mistake (because cmp(pointer_to(a), pointer_to(c))
  returns INT_MIN - INT_MAX = +1, which is incorrectly positive because
  this subtraction overflows).

Unfortunately, such nontransitive comparison functions are extremely
common, as discussed in this excellent blog post from Ted Unangst:

  <a href="https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/subtraction-is-not-comparison" rel="nofollow">https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/subtraction-is-not-comparison</a>

and as hinted at in OpenBSD's manual page for qsort(): "It is almost
always an error to use subtraction to compute the return value of the
comparison function."

Fortunately, when passed to a robust qsort() implementation, these
nontransitive comparison functions should (at the worst) result in an
incorrectly sorted array; certainly not in a memory corruption. However,
the aforementioned entry from Postfix's HISTORY file suggests that not
all qsort() implementations are robust.


========================================================================
Experiments
========================================================================

We therefore decided to assess the robustness of the glibc's qsort()
implementation, by calling it with a nontransitive comparison function:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1 #include &lt;limits.h&gt;
  2 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
  3 #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;
  4 
  5 static int
  6 cmp(const void * const pa, const void * const pb)
  7 {
  8     const int a = *(const int *)pa;
  9     const int b = *(const int *)pb;
 10     return (a - b);
 11 }
 12 
 13 int
 14 main(const int argc, const char * const argv[])
 15 {
 16     if (argc != 2) return __LINE__;
 17     const size_t nmemb = strtoul(argv[1], NULL, 0);
 18     if (nmemb &lt;= 0 || nmemb &gt;= (1&lt;&lt;28)) return __LINE__;
 19 
 20     int * const pcanary1 = calloc(1 + nmemb + 1, sizeof(int));
 21     if (!pcanary1) return __LINE__;
 22     int * const array = pcanary1 + 1;
 23     int * const pcanary2 = array + nmemb;
 24 
 25     struct timeval tv;
 26     if (gettimeofday(&amp;tv, NULL)) return __LINE__;
 27     srandom((tv.tv_sec &lt;&lt; 16) ^ tv.tv_usec);
 28 
 29     const int canary1 = *pcanary1 = (random() &lt;&lt; 16) ^ random();
 30     const int canary2 = *pcanary2 = (random() &lt;&lt; 16) ^ random();
 31     array[random() % nmemb] = INT_MIN;
 32 
 33     qsort(array, nmemb, sizeof(int), cmp);
 34     if (*pcanary1 != canary1) abort();
 35     if (*pcanary2 != canary2) abort();
 36     return 0;
 37 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at lines 5-11, cmp() is the nontransitive comparison function
  introduced in the previous "Background" section;

- at lines 16-18, the number of elements to be sorted (simple integers)
  is read from the command line;

- at lines 20-23, the array of elements to be sorted is calloc()ated,
  along with a canary element below this array, and a canary element
  above this array;

- at lines 29-30, these two canary elements are randomized, and copied
  to the stack for later comparison;

- at line 31, one random element of the array is initialized to INT_MIN
  (all other elements are initialized to 0 by calloc());

- at line 33, the elements of this array are sorted by qsort();

- at lines 34-35, the two canary elements (below and above the sorted
  array) are checked against their stack copies, and if they differ (an
  out-of-bounds write in qsort()), abort() is called.

We chose the array elements a = INT_MIN and b = 0 because they directly
exhibit the problematic behavior of this cmp() function:

- a &lt; b, because cmp(pointer_to(a), pointer_to(b)) returns INT_MIN - 0,
  which is correctly negative;

- but b &lt; a by mistake, because cmp(pointer_to(b), pointer_to(a))
  returns 0 - INT_MIN = INT_MIN (the "Leblancian Paradox"), which is
  incorrectly negative (because this subtraction overflows).

We then executed our test program in a loop, on Fedora 39 (which uses
the latest glibc version, 2.38):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ while true; do n=$((RANDOM*64+RANDOM+1)); ./qsort $n; done
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unsurprisingly, nothing happened: our program did not crash or abort().
While this loop was still running (and not crashing), we started to read
the glibc's qsort() implementation; to our great surprise, we discovered
that the glibc's qsort() is not, in fact, a quick sort by default, but a
merge sort (in stdlib/msort.c).

Most likely, merge sort was chosen over quick sort to avoid quick sort's
worst-case performance, which is O(n^2); on the other hand, merge sort's
worst-case performance is O(n*log(n)). But merge sort suffers from one
major drawback: it does not sort in-place -- it malloc()ates a copy of
the array of elements to be sorted. As a result, if this array is very
large (lines 212-217), or if this malloc() fails (lines 219-229), then
the glibc's qsort() falls back to a quick sort (in stdlib/qsort.c),
because quick sort does sort in-place:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
163 void
164 __qsort_r (void *b, size_t n, size_t s, __compar_d_fn_t cmp, void *arg)
165 {
166   size_t size = n * s;
...
170   /* For large object sizes use indirect sorting.  */
171   if (s &gt; 32)
172     size = 2 * n * sizeof (void *) + s;
173 
174   if (size &lt; 1024)
175     /* The temporary array is small, so put it on the stack.  */
176     p.t = __alloca (size);
177   else
178     {
...
212       /* If the memory requirements are too high don't allocate memory.  */
213       if (size / pagesize &gt; (size_t) phys_pages)
214         {
215           _quicksort (b, n, s, cmp, arg);
216           return;
217         }
218 
219       /* It's somewhat large, so malloc it.  */
220       int save = errno;
221       tmp = malloc (size);
222       __set_errno (save);
223       if (tmp == NULL)
224         {
225           /* Couldn't get space, so use the slower algorithm
226              that doesn't need a temporary array.  */
227           _quicksort (b, n, s, cmp, arg);
228           return;
229         }
230       p.t = tmp;
231     }
...
299 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We therefore decided to assess the robustness of the glibc's quick sort
(instead of its merge sort, which was clearly not crashing), by forcing
qsort() to call _quicksort(). Locally, forcing the malloc() at line 221
to fail is very easy: we simply execute our program with a low RLIMIT_AS
("The maximum size of the process's virtual memory", man setrlimit); and
this works even when executing a SUID-root program. So we executed our
program in the following loop instead:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ while true; do n=$((RANDOM*64+RANDOM+1)); prlimit --as=$((n*4/2*3)) ./qsort $n; done
Aborted (core dumped)
Aborted (core dumped)
Aborted (core dumped)
...
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Incredibly, we almost immediately observed crashes of our test program:
calls to abort(), because one of our canary elements (below or above the
sorted array) was overwritten (i.e., an out-of-bounds write in qsort()).
To understand these crashes, we examined one of them in gdb:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ gdb prlimit
(gdb) run --as=8104854 ./qsort 1350809
Starting program: /usr/bin/prlimit --as=8104854 ./qsort 1350809

- at address 0x7ffff78af010 (pcanary1), the original value of the canary
  (0xc6109e4c) was overwritten with 0x0 -- an out-of-bounds write;

- at address 0x7ffff78af00c (below pcanary1), the most significant word
  of an mchunk_size (heap metadata) was overwritten with 0x80000000
  (INT_MIN) -- another out-of-bounds write;

- at address 0x7ffff78af014 (above pcanary1), the first element of the
  array was overwritten with 0xc6109e4c (the original value of the
  canary), which was therefore read out-of-bounds beforehand (from
  pcanary1).


========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================

To identify the root cause of these out-of-bounds memory accesses, we
must analyze the implementation of the glibc's quick sort:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 87 void
 88 _quicksort (void *const pbase, size_t total_elems, size_t size,
 89             __compar_d_fn_t cmp, void *arg)
 90 {
 91   char *base_ptr = (char *) pbase;
...
108       while (STACK_NOT_EMPTY)
109         {
...
193         }
...
206     char *tmp_ptr = base_ptr;
...
214     for (run_ptr = tmp_ptr + size; run_ptr &lt;= thresh; run_ptr += size)
215       if ((*cmp) ((void *) run_ptr, (void *) tmp_ptr, arg) &lt; 0)
216         tmp_ptr = run_ptr;
217 
218     if (tmp_ptr != base_ptr)
219       SWAP (tmp_ptr, base_ptr, size);
...
223     run_ptr = base_ptr + size;
224     while ((run_ptr += size) &lt;= end_ptr)
225       {
226         tmp_ptr = run_ptr - size;
227         while ((*cmp) ((void *) run_ptr, (void *) tmp_ptr, arg) &lt; 0)
228           tmp_ptr -= size;
...
246       }
...
248 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at lines 108-193, when quick sort's partitions become smaller than
  MAX_THRESH (4 elements), _quicksort() switches to a final insertion
  sort (at lines 206-246), which is faster than quick sort for small or
  mostly sorted arrays;

- at lines 206-219, this insertion sort makes sure that the very first
  element of the array (base_ptr) is the smallest element of the array;

- at lines 226-228, this first element acts as a natural barrier that
  prevents tmp_ptr from being decremented below the array (because if
  tmp_ptr reaches base_ptr, then necessarily cmp(run_ptr, tmp_ptr) &gt;= 0
  because tmp_ptr is base_ptr, the smallest element of the array);

- unfortunately this does not hold true if cmp() is nontransitive, in
  which case cmp(run_ptr, tmp_ptr) can be &lt; 0 even if tmp_ptr is
  base_ptr, so tmp_ptr can be decremented below the array, where
  out-of-bounds elements are read and overwritten.


========================================================================
Patch
========================================================================

To patch these out-of-bounds memory accesses in _quicksort(), a simple
check "tmp_ptr &gt; base_ptr &amp;&amp;" can be added in front of the cmp() call at
line 227 (of course this does not magically result in a correctly sorted
array if cmp() is nontransitive, but at least it does not result in a
memory corruption anymore).

In fact, while drafting this advisory, we discovered that such a check
("tmp_ptr != base_ptr &amp;&amp;") has already been added to the glibc's master
branch (which will become glibc 2.39 in February 2024), by the following
commit ("stdlib: Fix array bounds protection in insertion sort phase of
qsort"):

  <a href="https://sourceware.org/git?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=b9390ba93676c4b1e87e218af5e7e4bb596312ac" rel="nofollow">https://sourceware.org/git?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=b9390ba93676c4b1e87e218af5e7e4bb596312ac</a>

Indeed, the glibc developers have recently refactored qsort() and
replaced the merge sort (and its fallback to quick sort) with an
introspective sort (a combination of quick sort, heap sort, and
insertion sort):

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introsort" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introsort</a>
  <a href="https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2023-October/151907.html" rel="nofollow">https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2023-October/151907.html</a>

During this refactoring, the glibc developers have proactively
discovered (and patched) the out-of-bounds memory accesses in the
insertion sort (probably because these out-of-bounds memory accesses
became directly exposed to the misbehavior of nontransitive comparison
functions, instead of being safely hidden behind a malloc() failure in
the merge sort).

Last-minute note: in January 2024, the glibc developers have reverted
this refactoring of qsort(), back to the original merge sort, plus a
fallback to heap sort instead of quick sort; for more information:

  <a href="https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2024-January/154051.html" rel="nofollow">https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2024-January/154051.html</a>


========================================================================
Discussion
========================================================================

We have not tried to find a vulnerable program (i.e., a program that
uses a nontransitive comparison function to qsort() attacker-controlled
elements); however, vulnerable programs are certain to exist in the real
world:

- calls to qsort() are extremely common;

- nontransitive comparison functions are also common;

- all glibc versions from at least September 1992 (glibc 1.04, the first
  version that we could find online) to the current release (glibc 2.38)
  are affected by this memory corruption.

Locally, forcing a malloc() failure in qsort() (which is necessary to
reach the memory corruption) is easy: either execute the target program
(e.g., a SUID-root program) with a low RLIMIT_AS, or allocate a large
amount of memory with another program on the same machine.

Remotely, forcing this malloc() failure is harder: either allocate a
large amount of memory (e.g., a memory leak) in the network service that
is being targeted, or in another network service on the same machine.

    <p>OLYMPIA —&nbsp;Victims of false confessions that lead to wrongful convictions, like Ted Bradford, want to prohibit police from using deceptive tactics during interrogations, and they have the backing of some lawmakers.</p><p>“It was the worst experience of my life,” said Bradford, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/will-new-dna-evidence-vindicate-yakima-man-cleared-in-1995-rape/">Washington’s first DNA exoneree</a>, when recalling his 1996 interrogation when he was accused of sexual assault. “I knew I was innocent … no matter how many times I told them over and over, I didn’t do this.”</p><p><a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1062&amp;Initiative=false&amp;Year=2023" target="_blank">House Bill 1062</a>, sponsored by Rep. Strom Peterson, D-Edmonds, aims to make defendants’ statements inadmissible in court if police use deceptive tactics during interrogations to get those statements. Nine states have passed similar laws, but they only apply to juveniles. The bill has received two hearings in the House this legislative session.</p><p>Advocates say this legislation, aside from keeping innocent people out of prison, is also about building trust between the public and law enforcement. Some in law enforcement argue that deception is not coercion and taking away this tactic decreases their effectiveness in convicting people and solving cases. </p><p>“I think there’s this space in the middle that often gets looked over, post-arrest, pre-conviction,” Peterson said. “There are a lot of things that happen there that I don’t think we’ve paid enough attention to.”</p><p>The majority of interrogations happen in the back of a patrol car or on the side of the road, according to Derick Sanders, Thurston County sheriff. He argues police tactics are always under the microscope.</p>
<p>James McMahan, policy director of the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, argued in public testimony on Jan 8 that deception is required to get to the truth. An example, he said, would be not telling a suspect in cases involving the exploitation of children the true age and identity of an undercover trooper who was posing as a minor. </p><p>“Sometimes, it’s an unfortunate reality, we have to lie to people to get them to tell the truth,” McMahan said. “If we could somehow get people to actually be required to tell the truth, we wouldn’t have to lie. That’s just an unfortunate reality of law enforcement.”</p><p>However, current police interrogations encourage bias and leave people vulnerable to the power imbalances between law enforcement and citizens, said Dave Thompson, president of Wicklander-Zulawski &amp; Associates, a firm that provides interrogation training to law enforcement.</p><h3>How a false confession is generated </h3><p>In 1996, Bradford, 22 at the time, was asked to come to the Yakima Police Department to help with a case. He said he was asked to waive his rights and when he asked police whether he needed an attorney they said no because they were only asking a few questions. He signed the waiver thinking he was going to help, but a few questions turned into a nearly nine-hour interrogation, with no food and a small cup of water, he said.</p><p>Identifying the wrong person begins with faulty evidence, and often police make people fit the evidence rather than the other way around, says James Trainum, a former detective with the Washington, D.C., Police Department who now does law enforcement consulting. </p><p>“Rather than develop your case, develop your suspect, develop your evidence, you’re taught that you can use this to bypass all of that, and just quickly identify a suspect, and then move on,” Trainum said.</p>
<p>In Washington state, 23% of exonerations involve false confessions, according to data from the Washington Innocence Project. However, this number could be higher because<strong> </strong>there’s not enough data to know the actual number of wrongful convictions in the state according to Lara Zarowsky, executive director of the Washington Innocence Project.</p><p>In the 1969 case Frazier v. Cupp, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of police using deception tactics during interrogations. The Reid technique, the most common technique used by police, includes using guilt-presumptive questions during interrogations. By lying to people about false evidence, Trainum says police hope to persuade a confession.</p><p>“Just because the courts find it permissible doesn’t mean that they’re not problematic,” said Trainum, who said he garnered a false confession in a 1994 high-profile kidnapping and murder case using the Reid technique.</p><p>Bradford’s battle to prove his innocence to police left him feeling threatened and intimidated after aggressive questioning and accusations. At the end of the day, he couldn’t handle it anymore and signed a confession. </p><p>Interrogations can differ depending on the situation, according to Sanders, the Thurston County sheriff.</p><p>“The type of crime, the temperament of the officer, the temperament of the suspect, those are all things that play a pretty big factor into how people are interrogated,” he said.</p>
<p>Sanders says not every case requires a ruse, but when they do, they’re used when police need people to think they know more than they do to close an investigation.</p><p>According to Sanders, there are already procedures in place that can dispute false confessions in what are called criminal rule 3.5 hearings, where defendants can have evidence dismissed if they assert police lied inappropriately or violated case law. He believes fewer wrongful convictions will exist as technology improves. </p><p>However, because of Frazier v. Cupp, decisions from criminal rule 3.5 hearings make their way to court anyway, said John Marlow, litigation director of the Washington Innocence Project. The court decides whether the confession is allowed as evidence and the jury ultimately decides whether it’s believable, Marlow said.</p>      <p>“The criminal legal system in practice does not operate in the way that we think it does when you just read the rules on paper,” Zarowsky said. </p><h3>Why confess to a crime you didn’t commit?</h3><p>In 2007, Amanda Knox was a 20-year-old college student at the University of Washington. She garnered worldwide attention after being wrongfully convicted of murdering her roommate Meredith Kercher in Italy during a study abroad trip. During her interrogation, Knox, who testified in support of <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1062&amp;Initiative=false&amp;Year=2023" target="_blank">HB 1062</a>, recalls police making her feel like she was going insane.</p><p>“The extent to which I was unprepared for people who I trusted to lie to me was what led me as an innocent person to be particularly vulnerable and which is what led to my eventual wrongful conviction,” Knox said in an interview.  </p>
<p>The more successful a strategy is in eliciting confessions from guilty suspects, the more likely it is that this strategy will also produce false confessions from innocent suspects, according to a 2004 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/reid-technique#:~:text=Research%20has%20revealed%20that%20confronting,in%20several%20Western%20European%20countries." target="_blank">research paper</a> published by the Encyclopedia of Applied Psychology.</p><p>Juveniles and people with intellectual disabilities are more susceptible to deception, the research showed. But under the right circumstances, this can happen to anyone, Zarowsky said.</p><p>Bradford recalls police making threats and lying to him about DNA evidence they said proved he committed the crime. After hours of interrogation, he confessed, hoping the evidence would acquit him.</p><p>“I started thinking to myself, the only way out of this is if I just give them a statement,” Bradford said. “Then they can test their evidence and they’ll find out that I’m innocent. I’ll be done. I’ll be free of all of this.”</p><p>Experts call this a coerced-complaint confession.</p><p>For Knox, during her 53-hour interrogation in Italy, she rarely had a translator and became tired and confused. Police accused her of having amnesia and she recalls an officer hitting her in the head and telling her to remember. By attempting to make sense of the situation, she ended up creating a false memory and signed what’s called a coerced-internalized confession. </p><p>“I was put in a position where I was made to feel insane because the police lied to me,” Knox said. “They told me that I had amnesia and that I didn’t remember what the truth was.”</p>
<h3>What alternatives exist?</h3><p>Prosecutors sometimes are reluctant to believe someone’s innocence even after DNA acquits someone, Saul Kassin, a professor of psychology at The City University of New York, wrote in his 2005 research paper, “On the Psychology of Confessions: Does Innocence Put Innocents at Risk?”</p><p>In Bradford’s case, he was charged again for the same crime, after serving his 10-year sentence, when he challenged his conviction with new DNA evidence.<strong> </strong>In Knox’s case, she<strong> </strong>went through the appeals process twice in Italy, but was ultimately not convicted. </p><p>For jurors, a confession is one of the most compelling pieces of evidence regardless of how unreliable it is, according to Matt Jones, president of Evocavi, a firm that trains law enforcement in interrogation techniques.</p><p>Advocates of HB 1062 say accountability measures like these raise law enforcement’s professionalism.</p><p>“I have absolutely not gone to the police for help as a result of my experience, because I didn’t feel like I could trust them and I don’t want to live in a world like that,” Knox said.</p><p>Peterson’s bill, which would also provide law enforcement with interrogation training, is currently in the House Appropriations Committee.</p><p>“A bill like this would just focus more on not just getting a conviction, but getting the right conviction,” Bradford said. “For every person that’s wrongly convicted, the real perpetrators out there, possibly committing more crimes.”</p>

KiCad has 'netclasses' which let you set trace widths, but it's all manual, same with the design rules checker. Each vendor seems to have their own design manual for these things, which is nice to have but so tedious -- I have to read a PDF to know what size decoupling cap goes with this IC? Why is that information not encoded in the footprint somehow?<p>I understand that auto-routing is not a solved problem by any means, but there should be more efficient tools to make it easier.

We think the path forward is to be able to encode the governing equations that you would get in say a buck controllers data sheet directly into our source code. That way from a user perspective you can define your circuit simply by importing modules, defining them (for example input voltage, output voltage and current) we can then solve the component values and pick them from our component database for you. One of our early users wrote a plugin to do LED arrays in an afternoon. Our compiler is all open so its pretty easy to add on custom scripts for whatever you might be wanting to do.</span></p></div></td></tr>

(I'm struggling to make that not sound sarcastic - maybe it's just my British reading! - but I really am sincere.)<p>When I was thinking about it, a couple of further directions I had in mind were 1) ecosystem/library/sharing of modules, so something like the voltage divider example is not something you'd need to do (even once) for every project; if it really took off the pipedream would be that application notes examples were just provided as modules, so you could take whatever IC wnd just import the module if you were using it in a standard way; 2) if you did a similar thing for layout constraints, you could then have that as part of the same module, and when you compile the whole thing (in hand-wavey generalised theory if sufficiently constrained) you could generate the overall layout for a project with say a SMPS and also sensitive analogue circuitry in a way that makes sense without either of those modules having to know that the other is in use, just because they have rules like distance from transistor, bypass cap to IC could be fully constrained, so you always get exactly the same sensible-looking layout, etc.</p><p>Anyway, looks great, I look forward to trying it properly some time!

We're pretty convinced that the awesomeness of the software ecosystem is a function of its openness and open-source and atopile largely came from working out how we could seed a similar shift in the hardware world.

I think these become much more powerful once we add in equations to help relate these values and link them together.

If the tool can help me layout a board in half the time, particularly for test hardware or the likes, that would be huge. Eventually I think we will get to a place where computers will do a better job of layout than most people, but thats a ways off.

This is currently hard to achieve with the existing close source standards we are dealing with in hardware.</p><p>ato is also a markup language (like markdown or latex) more than an actual programming language. We think this makes it more readable and helps guide the user writing code that compiles.

Looking for alpha testers when I release, sign up if you wanna try it out or just wanna try some mock coding. If its slow to load, sorry, everything runs on free tiers right now.</p><p>I really dislike doing leetcode prep, and I can't intuitively understand the solutions by just reading them. I've found the best way for me to learn is to seriously try the problem (timed, interview like conditions), and be able to 'discuss' with the interviewer without just jumping to reading the solution. Been using and building this as an experiment to try prepping in a manner I like.</p><p>It's not a replacement for real mock interviews - I think those are still the best, but they're expensive and time consuming. I'm hoping to get 80% of the benefit in an easier package.</p><p>I just put a waitlist in case anyone wants to try it out and give me feedback when I get it out</p><p>Gonna apologize in advance about the copywriting.

Just like how the iPhone reduced everything to a single button press, we can now squeeze the functionality of some pretty complicated apps into natural language through text - and as the response time of LLM's improves it will become a short conversation for things that used to dazzle new users! Exciting times!<p>As for the stack, I have Supabase and Typescript on the frontend, python on the backend and k3's as a cluster for my apps (can recommend this if you want to get devops-y on a budget). Next time, I'll just go pure Typescript since python really doesn't add much working this far away from the base models.

Most of the work is manual, but does seem easily run as "fire and forget" with maybe some ways to correct afterwards.</p><p>First, I'm using the pyannote for speech recognition: it converts audio to text, while being able to discern speakers: SPEAKER_01, _02, etc. The diarization provides nice timestamps, with resolution down to parts of words, which I later use in the minimal UI to quickly skip around, when a text is selected.</p><p>Next, I'm running a LLM prompt to identify speakers; so if SPEAKER_02 said to SPEAKER_05 "Hey Greg", it will identify SPEAKER_05 = Greg. I think it was my first time using the mistral 7b and I went "wow" out loud, once it got correct.</p><p>After that, I fill in the holes manually in speaker names and move on to grouping a bunch of text - in order to summarize. That doesn't seem interesting at a glance, but removing the filler words, which there are a ton of in any presentation or meeting, is a huge help. I do it chunk by chunk. I'm leaning here for the best LLM available and often pick the dolphin finetune of mixtral.</p><p>Last, I summarize those summarizations and slap that on the front of the google doc.</p><p>I also insert some relevant screenshots in between chunks (might go with some ffmpeg automatic scene change detection in the future).</p><p>aaand that's it. A doc, that is searchable easily. So, previously I had a bunch of 30 min. to 90 min. meeting recordings and any attempt at searching required a linear scan of files. Now, with a lot of additional prompt messaging I was able to:</p><p>- create meeting notes, with especially worthwile "what did I promise to send later" points</p><p>- this is huge: TALK with the transcript. I paste the whole transcript into the mistral 7b with 32k context and simply ask questions and follow-ups. No more watching or skimming an hour long video, just ask the transcript, if there was another round of lay-offs or if parking spaces rules changed.</p><p>- draw a mermaid sequence diagram, of a request flowing across services. It wasn't perfect, but it got me super excited about future possibilities to create or update service documentation based on ad-hoc meetings.</p><p>I guess everybody is actually trying to build the same, seems like a no-brainer based on current tool's capabilities.

                  <p><span>The main differences fundamentally come down to OpenAI treating it more like a party trick demo, rather than a core functionality. I think it has a lot of potential if I can just fine tune a couple rough edges. (When you chat with someone in person, you don't pull out notebooks a write messages to each other. I see writing as a fallback medium.)<p>To answer your question more specifically,</p><p>Pro Bonamiko:</p><pre><code>  - Faster average first response latency (but higher first audio latency since OpenAI uses a ding). This is the main focus currently, reducing latency as much as I can. I'd like to be able to avoid the ding, but we'll see how low I can get it.
  - Can be used anywhere with a browser, OpenAI requires a mobile app installed. (I.E. Desktop support)
  - In the future we can support deeper customization since we are focused on the audio medium. As soon as you have to run a function in the ChatGPT app there is a long response latency, which could easily be fixed by something as simple as the AI saying "Let me perform a search to get the details"
</code></pre>
Pro ChatGPT:<pre><code>  - Nice animation
  - Already has built in tool support such as web search
  - Supports language switching automatically between messages, Bonamiko requires manually changing the language</code></pre></span></p></div></td></tr>

So my attempt at working on modifying code with LLM is starting with HTML and having GPT-4 write beautfulsoup code that then makes the desired modification to the HTML file. Will do with js, python via ast, etc. No link for this one yet :) still in development.

  <p dir="ltr" data-test-id="main-feed-activity-card__commentary">Hi everyone

I am very sad to announce - officially - that Weaveworks will be closing its doors and shutting down commercial operations.&nbsp; Customers and partners will be working with a financial trustee whom we shall announce soon. 

The company was turning over double digit (&gt;$10M) revenue and had more than doubled the number of new product logos in 2023.&nbsp; However this sales growth was lumpy and our cash position, consequently volatile.&nbsp; We needed a partner or investor for long term growth.&nbsp; Finally a very promising M&amp;A process with a larger company fell through at the 11th hour.&nbsp; And so we decided to shut down.&nbsp; 

I can only apologize to everyone for this difficult turn. &nbsp; I could say that this should not have happened, but I know that we are not alone in this market.&nbsp; Bigger vessels have gone astray.&nbsp; The Weaveworks team is a special group and it has been a long and tough journey.&nbsp; I know that everyone has been so motivated to do their very best for our customers, our open source community, and each other.&nbsp; You have done well and can be proud.&nbsp; We shall always have a shared story.

Our story has been so exciting - from the first days of containers, struggling to be born.&nbsp; The day when someone got Kubernetes working for the first time on Azure.&nbsp; The start of the CNCF.&nbsp; The day when we wiped out our systems with a keypress.&nbsp; The first months of the Covid pandemic.&nbsp; Then investment and our work to figure out GitOps for a lot of great enterprise customers.&nbsp; And there have been dire moments too but we figured most of them out together. You’ve shared all of this and all deserve every memory of a good place to work, and with the privilege of knowing that all of you are among the best.

The story does not end here - our open source software is used everywhere.&nbsp; I am working with several large organizations to make sure CNCF Flux is in the healthiest state.&nbsp; More on that soon.&nbsp; And I would invite anyone who reads this and wants to know what is next or offer some help, please get in touch with me!&nbsp; Thank you.

We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.

Alexis Richardson, 5 Feb 2024</p>

We spent the month of January carefully reviewing all submissions. Our team of eminent papyrologists worked day and night to review 15 columns of text in anonymized submissions, while the technical team audited and reproduced the submitted code and methods.</p><p>There was one submission that stood out clearly from the rest. Working independently, each member of our team of papyrologists recovered more text from this submission than any other. Remarkably, the entry achieved the criteria we set when announcing the Vesuvius Challenge in March: 4 passages of 140 characters each, with at least 85% of characters recoverable. This was not a given: most of us on the organizing team assigned a less than 30% probability of success when we announced these criteria! And in addition, the submission includes another 11 (!) columns of text — more than 2000 characters total.</p><p>The results of this review were clear and unanimous: the Vesuvius Challenge Grand Prize of $700,000 is awarded to a team of three for their excellent submission.

You may remember Youssef. He is the Egyptian PhD student in Berlin who was able to read a few columns of text back in October, winning the second-place <a href="https://scrollprize.org/firstletters">First Letters Prize</a>. His results back then were particularly clear and readable, which made him the natural lead for the team that formed.</p><p>You might remember Luke as well: he is the 21-year-old college student and SpaceX intern from Nebraska, who was the first person in history to read an entire word from the inside of a Herculaneum scroll (ΠΟΡΦΥΡΑϹ, “purple”). This won him the first-place First Letters Prize, a few weeks before Youssef’s results.</p><p>And finally, you might remember Julian.

Our eminent team of papyrologists has been hard at work and has achieved a preliminary transcription of all the revealed columns. We now know that this scroll is not a duplicate of an existing work; it contains never-before-seen text from antiquity. The papyrology team are preparing to deliver a comprehensive study as soon as they can. You all gave them a lot of work to do! Initial readings already provide glimpses into this philosophical text. From our scholars:</p><p>The general subject of the text is pleasure, which, properly understood, is the highest good in Epicurean philosophy. In these two snippets from two consecutive columns of the scroll, the author is concerned with whether and how the availability of goods, such as food, can affect the pleasure which they provide.</p><p>Do things that are available in lesser quantities afford more pleasure than those available in abundance? Our author thinks not: <em>“as too in the case of food, we do not right away believe things that are scarce to be absolutely more pleasant than those which are abundant.”</em> However, is it easier for us naturally to do without things that are plentiful? <em>“Such questions will be considered frequently.”</em></p><p>Since this is the end of a scroll, this phrasing may suggest that more is coming in subsequent books of the same work. At the beginning of the first text, a certain Xenophantos is mentioned, perhaps the same man — presumably a musician — also mentioned by Philodemus in his work <em>On Music</em>.</p><p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philodemus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philodemus</a>, of the Epicurean school, is thought to have been the philosopher-in-residence of the villa, working in the small library in which the scrolls were found.</p><p>Initial, rough draft transcriptions:</p><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/col-8.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/col-8.png"></a></p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>    col. -8, ll. 2-14:</span><br></span><span><span>2   ...]ι̣μ̣εν τοὺϲ̣ [πα]ρ̣[ὰ Ξ]ε̣-</span><br></span><span><span>    νοφάντωι το̣ιούτου[ϲ,</span><br></span><span><span>    ὃ καὶ ὑπ’ ἄ̣λλων δοκεῖ</span><br></span><span><span>5   γείνεϲθαι, παραπλη-</span><br></span><span><span>    ϲίωϲ δ̣’ ο̣ὐδὲ παρ̣’ ἑτέρωι</span><br></span><span><span>    ἴδι̣ον το̣ῦ δ̣οκοῦ̣ντοϲ̣</span><br></span><span><span>    εἶναι καὶ παρὰ πλε̣ί-</span><br></span><span><span>    οϲ̣ι̣ν̣ ἥδιο̣ν, ἀλλ’ ὡ̣ϲ̣ καὶ</span><br></span><span><span>10  ἐ̣π̣ὶ τῶν βρω̣μ̣άτ̣ων</span><br></span><span><span>    ο̣ὐ̣κ ἤδ̣η τὰ ϲπάνια</span><br></span><span><span>    πάντωϲ̣ καὶ ἡδ̣ίω</span><br></span><span><span>    τῶν δ̣αψιλῶν̣ ε̣ἶναι̣</span><br></span><span><span>14  νομίζ̣ο̣με̣ν· οὐ γ̣ὰρ̣</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/col-7.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/col-7.png"></a></p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>    col. -7, ll. 4-10:</span><br></span><span><span>    λ̣ει παρὰ τὰ δαψιλῆ.</span><br></span><span><span>5   θεωρηθήϲεται δὲ τὰ</span><br></span><span><span>    τοιαῦθ’ οὕτω{ι} πολ̣λά-</span><br></span><span><span>    κιϲ πότερον ὅ̣ταν πα-</span><br></span><span><span>    ρῇ τὸ δαψιλέϲτερον</span><br></span><span><span>    ἡ φύϲιϲ ἥδιον ἀπαλλάτ-</span><br></span><span><span>10  τει το̣ύ̣τ̣ο̣υ̣ καὶ πάλ̣ι̣ν̣ ̣ ̣</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div><p>Later in the scroll:</p><p>In the closing section of the text our author takes a parting shot at his adversaries, who <em>“have nothing to say about pleasure, either in general or in particular, when it is a question of definition.”</em></p><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/col-2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/col-2.png"></a></p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>    col. -2, ll. 2-8:</span><br></span><span><span>2   ἑ̣κάϲτηϲ κριτηρίων</span><br></span><span><span>    θεωροῦνται. πρὸϲ δὲ</span><br></span><span><span>    οὔτε καθόλου περὶ</span><br></span><span><span>5   ἡδονῆϲ ἐχόντων τι</span><br></span><span><span>    λέγειν οὔτε περὶ τῆϲ</span><br></span><span><span>    κατὰ μ̣έ̣ρο̣ϲ̣, ὅ̣τε ὡ-</span><br></span><span><span>8   ριϲμένον τι, ἀλλ’ οὖν</span><br></span><span><span>    …</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div><p>Finally the scroll concludes:</p><p><em>“… for we do [not] refrain from questioning some things, but understanding/remembering others.

So many questions! But improvements to the identification of the ink, which can be expected, will soon answer most of them. I can hardly wait.”</p><p><a href="https://www.docenti.unina.it/federica.nicolardi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federica Nicolardi</a> told us:</p><p>“Epicureanism says hi, with a text full of music, food, senses, and pleasure!”</p><p>From <a href="https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/fellows/robert-fowler-FBA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Fowler</a>:</p><p>“Like other Epicureans, he valued pleasure above all - but pleasure rightly understood, not mere indulgence. Living in ancient Rome - a society not known for abstinence - Philodemus could expect to meet with scepticism from his readers.”</p><p>Scholars might call it a philosophical treatise. But it seems familiar to us, and we can’t escape the feeling that the first text we’ve uncovered is a 2000-year-old blog post about how to enjoy life. Is Philodemus throwing shade at the stoics in his closing paragraph, asserting that stoicism is an incomplete philosophy because it has “nothing to say about pleasure?” The questions he seems to discuss — life’s pleasures and what makes life worth living — are still on our minds today.</p><p>We can expect many more works from Philodemus in the current collection, once we’re able to scale up this technique.

More about this below!</p><h2 id="how-accurate-are-these-pictures">How accurate are these pictures?<a href="#how-accurate-are-these-pictures" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Machine learning models are infamous for “hallucinating”: making up text or pictures that look similar to their training data. Similarly, there might be ways for contestants to cheat by making up images themselves, e.g. by embedding those in the model weights. How do we know that that’s not happening here? There are a couple of answers:</p><ul><li><strong>Technical reproduction.</strong> The Vesuvius Challenge Technical Review Team reproduced the winning submissions manually. We made sure to clearly understand every part of the code, and that when we run it independently we get similar output images. Since all code and training data is now open source, you can do the same!</li><li><strong>Multiple submissions of the same area.</strong> You might have noticed that all submission images above show the same area of the scroll. This is because we released 3d-mapped papyrus sheets within the CT-scan (“segments”) created by our segmentation team, which were then used by all contestants. The resulting output images — created by different ML models and training labels — have produced extremely similar results. This holds not just for the winners and runner ups, but also for the other submissions that we received.</li><li><strong>Small input/output windows.</strong> The ink detection models are not based on Greek letters, optical character recognition (OCR), or language models. Instead, they independently detect tiny spots of ink in the CT scan, the writing appearing later when these are aggregated. As a result, the text appearing in the images is not the imagined output of a machine learning model, but is instead directly tied to the underlying data in the CT scan.</li></ul><figure><video autoplay="" playsinline="" loop="" muted="" poster="https://scrollprize.org/img/tutorials/ink-detection-anim3-dark.jpg"><source src="https://scrollprize.org/img/tutorials/ink-detection-anim3-dark.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://scrollprize.org/img/tutorials/ink-detection-anim3-dark.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><figcaption>The models use small input/output windows.

Stephen Parsons at Brent’s lab had <a href="https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cs_etds/138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shown</a> that Herculaneum ink could theoretically be detected in CT scans, but so far only using smaller fragments — detecting ink in the larger scans of complete scrolls had yet to be achieved. For months this part proved elusive, until progress was made on two separate tracks:</p><ol><li><strong>Crackle pattern.</strong> Last summer, Casey Handmer <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2023/08/05/reading-ancient-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discovered</a> a strange pattern of “crackle” by looking at raw flattened surface volumes. This pattern appeared to form letters. Casey won the First Ink Prize for this monumental discovery and shared it with the community, and a flurry of activity followed.</li></ol><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/firstletters/pi1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/firstletters/pi2.png"></figure><p>Luke Farritor (Grand Prize winner), immediately started hunting for more crackle in flattened surface volumes produced by the segmentation team. He then trained a machine learning model on the shapes he found, which led directly to him winning the <a href="https://scrollprize.org/firstletters">First Letters Prize</a> in October.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Kaggle competition.</strong> Separately, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/vesuvius-challenge-ink-detection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hundreds of teams</a> tried building the best machine learning model for detecting ink in open fragments — pieces that had broken off during the physical unrolling process of scrolls, hundreds of years ago. Instead of labeling crackle (which wasn’t known yet), they had the benefit of ground truth data directly from photos of these fragments.</li></ol><div><div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/data/fr1.jpg"></p><figcaption>Photo of Fragment 1</figcaption></div><div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/data/ir-fr1.png"></p><figcaption>Aligned infrared</figcaption></div><div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/data/inklabels-fr1.png"></p><figcaption>Aligned binary ink labels</figcaption></div></div><p>This resulted in excellent models, but they did not seem to work on the flattened segments which the segmentation team produced. That was, until Youssef Nader (Grand Prize winner) used domain adaptation techniques on them, the start of a technique that ultimately won him the second place First Letters Prize.</p><p>After the success of the First Letters Prize, the Grand Prize seemed within reach. Youssef, Luke, and Julian teamed up, with several other teams putting in strong submissions as well.</p><h2 id="what-did-it-take">What did it take?<a href="#what-did-it-take" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>With the Vesuvius Challenge, we hope not only to solve the problem of reading the Herculaneum Papyri, but also to inspire similar projects. For that, it’s helpful to know what has contributed to our success in 2023. Here are some things we believe were important:</p><ol><li><strong>An inspiring goal and a clear target.</strong> There are many worthy causes in the world, so it helps that our goal is unusual for a computing competition. It drew more press and donations early on, it attracted an intrinsically motivated community, and it increased our probability of success to begin with (emerging research area =&gt; a higher marginal utility of dollars spent). We’d love to see more projects that are “out there,” for exactly these reasons!</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/banner.jpg"></p><ol start="2"><li><strong>A solid starting point.</strong> The foundation was laid by <a href="https://www2.cs.uky.edu/dri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Seales and his team</a>. They spent two decades making the first scroll scans, building <a href="https://scrollprize.org/community_projects#volume-cartographer">Volume Cartographer</a>, demonstrating the <a href="https://www2.cs.uky.edu/dri/the-scroll-from-en-gedi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first success</a> in virtual unwrapping, and <a href="https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cs_etds/138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proving</a> that Herculaneum ink can be detected in CT.</li></ol><div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/landing/brent1.webp"></p><figcaption>Brent Seales, Seth Parker, and Michael Drakopoulos at the particle accelerator.</figcaption></div><ol start="3"><li><strong>Blending competition and cooperation.</strong> A Grand Prize on its own would suffer from information “hoarding”: no one would share their intermediate work, because others could take it and use it to beat them to the finish line. Without information sharing, the probability of a single team solving all the puzzle pieces to win the Grand Prize would be dramatically lower.</li></ol><p>Instead, we blended competition and cooperation by adding <a href="https://scrollprize.org/winners">“progress prizes”</a> along the way. These were smaller prizes (often in the $1,000-10,000 range) every ~2 months. To win a progress prize, you had to publish your code or research as open source, thereby benefiting the entire community.</p><div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/winners1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/winners3.png"></p><figcaption>Some of the many prize winners.</figcaption></div><p>Besides “leveling up” the entire community, this had several side benefits. We generated buzz and excitement in the community, which was motivating for everyone. It allowed winners to re-invest their winnings into better equipment, compute time, or even reduced hours at work or study to dedicate more to the competition. And it allowed people to find each other and form teams — like we saw with the Grand Prize winners.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Hiring an in-house segmentation team.</strong> Every week we asked ourselves: what is the best thing we can do now to maximize the chance that someone wins the Grand Prize? In early summer, this led to the (then somewhat controversial) decision of hiring a full-time team of data labelers to manually trace the papyrus inside the scrolls and open source the flattened segments.</li></ol><p>An alternative was to leave the problem of segmentation to the contestants, or even to award separate prizes for segments, but this had several downsides. First, it’s hard to judge segment quality before knowing what to look for (we didn’t have working ink detection yet). Incentivizing segment quantity would automatically penalize quality. Second, labeling work is tedious and time consuming, and turned out to have a long learning curve, so it’s desirable to guarantee some compensation, which can’t be done with a prize. Third, the feedback loop with prizes can be pretty long.</p><p>We were not dogmatically attached to just being referees; we were willing to run out onto the field and kick the ball a little. So we did what we thought would maximize success, and for the critical bottleneck of segmentation, that meant hiring a team.</p><div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/ben-smaller.jpg"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/david.jpg"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/konrad-smaller.jpg"></p><figcaption>Our wonderful segmentation team: Ben, David, and Konrad. Also a big shout-out to former team members!</figcaption></div><p>Ultimately, this decision worked out great. It led directly to Casey Handmer’s <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2023/08/05/reading-ancient-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discovery</a> of the “crackle pattern” — the first directly visible evidence of ink and letters within the complete scrolls. The in-house segmentation expertise also turned out to be invaluable throughout the rest of the competition, discovering areas with potentially high ink signal, and figuring out the intricacies of the structure of the scrolls. And the segmenters worked closely with community contestants, which led to much better segmentation software. It was the best of both worlds!</p><ol start="5"><li><strong>Maximizing surface area for breakthroughs.</strong> Our success was the result of many smaller breakthroughs by a broad group of people. It’s remarkable how many things had to come together to make this happen. Remove any of these, and we would not have succeeded, at least not within this timeframe.</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/steps.png"></p><p>There are many more contributions than we can list here - even ideas and discoveries landing outside the critical path were still important, because a massive search space had to be exhausted to find the ideas that worked. Given the right framework, the collective intelligence of a community like this is very powerful.</p><h2 id="whats-next-announcing-the-2024-vesuvius-challenge-grand-prize">What’s next? Announcing the 2024 Vesuvius Challenge Grand Prize.<a href="#whats-next-announcing-the-2024-vesuvius-challenge-grand-prize" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When we started the competition, most of us estimated that we had a less than 30% probability of success within the year. At that point, no letters had yet been discovered inside of a scroll. On top of that, the scrolls had barely been segmented at all. We had doubt as to whether the project could succeed, especially by the deadline we set. Was the ink signal present? Were the scans high-resolution enough? Could the techniques used to identify ink in the fragments be transferred into a scroll? None of this was known at the time. But we knew it was worth trying!</p><p>In Stage 1 of the Vesuvius Challenge, we answered all of these questions, extracting 15 columns of never-before-seen text from inside a lump of carbon. We now have proven techniques for virtually unrolling the papyrus scroll and recognizing ink using machine learning.</p><h3 id="vesuvius-challenge-stage-2">Vesuvius Challenge Stage 2<a href="#vesuvius-challenge-stage-2" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In 2023 we got from 0% to 5% of a scroll. In 2024 our goal is to go from 5% of one scroll, to 90% of all four scrolls we have scanned, and to lay the foundation to read all 800 scrolls.</p><p>The primary goal for 2024 is to read 90% of the scrolls, and <strong>we will issue the 2024 Grand Prize to the first team that is able to do this</strong>. More details on the exact grand prize judging criteria will be available in March.</p><p>The bottleneck to achieve this milestone is the process of tracing the surface of the papyrus inside the scroll. Today this is extremely manual. It cost us more than $100 per square centimeter in manual labor to produce the text we can read today. At this price, it would cost hundreds of millions or maybe even billions of dollars to segment all of the scrolls. While improvements to our segmentation tools have increased our efficiency, it is still far too manual and expensive. What we need is automation.</p><p>And so our primary goal for stage 2 is to perfect autosegmentation. Done right, this will also allow us to read the most challenging regions within the scroll – areas where the scroll was heavily compressed, cracked, delaminated, or otherwise damaged – which in many cases our current tools cannot even penetrate.</p><p>In 2023 we were amazed by the community contributions. We loved the competition for the grand prize, which brought out the best in the contestants, but we were also thrilled to see the community collaborate towards intermediate goals. In 2024 we are leaning into that, still offering a grand prize, but allocating even more of the prize pool towards community contributions – a pool that will grow as we raise more money.</p><p>We’re also planning to help speed things along ourselves, balancing prizes and in-house expertise to continue the collaboration that worked so well in 2023.

We estimate that the scrolls we have in Naples contain more than 16 megabytes of text. Some members of our papyrology team say that revealing this text will be the greatest revolution in the classics since the Renaissance. However it goes, it will certainly be fun to try!</p><p>And as if the prospect of reading hundreds of scrolls isn’t good enough, there might be an even bigger payoff at the end of all of this (as Nat said on the <a href="https://youtu.be/qcvMjoJdck4?t=646" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwarkesh podcast</a>: <em>“there is gold in this mud”</em>).</p><p>“The scrolls we have now may be just the beginning. When part of the Villa of the Papyri was cleared in the 1990s, archaeologists realized that the building was much larger than previously thought, with two unexcavated levels. At the very least, these floors likely contain more papyri in cabinets and carrying cases. And it’s probable that they conceal a far greater treasure.</p><p>We have not yet found the villa’s main library, which would have contained a much wider range of Greek and Latin literature. That library, with its thousands or even tens of thousands of scrolls, must still be buried. If those texts are discovered, and if even a small fraction can still be read, they will transform our knowledge of classical life and literature on a scale not seen since the Renaissance.”</p><p>The potential of tens of thousands of scrolls, still buried, waiting to be discovered?!

<p><em>This piece was produced with support from </em><a href="https://thecapitolforum.com/?ref=404media.co"><em><u>The Capitol Forum</u></em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p><p>An underground website called OnlyFake is claiming to use “neural networks” to generate realistic looking photos of fake IDs for just $15, radically disrupting the marketplace for fake identities and cybersecurity more generally. This technology, which 404 Media has verified produces fake IDs nearly instantly, could streamline everything from bank fraud to laundering stolen funds.</p><p>In our own tests, OnlyFake created a highly convincing California driver's license, complete with whatever arbitrary name, biographical information, address, expiration date, and signature we wanted. The photo even gives the appearance that the ID card is laying on a fluffy carpet, as if someone has placed it on the floor and snapped a picture, which many sites require for verification purposes. 404 Media then used another fake ID generated by this site to successfully step through the identity verification process on OKX. OKX is a cryptocurrency exchange that has recently <a href="https://www.404media.co/how-a-single-pig-butchering-scam-netted-40-million/"><u>appeared in multiple court records</u></a> because of its use by criminals.</p><p>Rather than painstakingly crafting a fake ID by hand—a highly skilled criminal profession that can take years to master—or waiting for a purchased one to arrive in the mail with the risk of interception, OnlyFake lets essentially anyone generate fake IDs in minutes that may seem real enough to bypass various online verification systems. Or at least fool some people.</p><p>“The era of rendering documents using Photoshop is coming to an end,” an announcement posted to OnlyFake’s Telegram account reads. As well as “neural networks,” the service claims to use “generators” which create up to 20,000 documents a day. The service’s owner, who goes by the moniker John Wick, told 404 Media that hundreds of documents can be generated at once using data from an Excel table.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-431331">


<h3>from the <i>this-is-why-we-can't-have-nice-things</i> dept</h3>

<p>For decades now, airlines, hotels, cable companies, banks and a long list of other companies have bilked U.S. consumers out of billions of dollars annually via bullshit fees that unfairly jack up the advertised price of service. More interesting perhaps is the fact that it it took until 2023 for a U.S. federal regulator to even ponder the idea that <em>this was perhaps bad and could or should be stopped</em>.</p>
<p>Last year, the FTC announced it would be cracking down on such fees. That included a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/P204800%20Auto%20Rule%20NPRM.pdf">126 page proposal</a> aimed at the auto industry’s use of “administrative fees,” document fees, and other markups used to fatten up the price consumers pay for new or used cars. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly the auto industry didn’t much like that, and has been fighting the effort in court. While the rules were supposed to go into effect on July 30, the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA)&nbsp;and Texas Automobile Dealers Association filed a challenge with the notoriously wacky (and corporate friendly) Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has <a href="https://jalopnik.com/dealers-successfully-force-the-feds-to-temporarily-back-1851178875">suspended the FTC’s plan upon review</a>.</p>
<p>As with most such challenges, the automakers are trying to claim the FTC doesn’t have the authority to implement such rules, despite the agency’s authority to police “unfair and deceptive” behavior being very clear under the FTC Act:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The dealership groups, in the petition to the Fifth Circuit, called it “an abuse of discretion” and seek the court to block its implementation. The FTC maintains that the rule “does not impose substantial costs, if any” on law-abiding dealerships, and instead simply guarantees a more even playing field for both dealerships and consumers by eliminating junk fees and hidden costs.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Automakers aren’t the only well funded corporations fighting the FTC’s effort. The cable industry is also hard at work fighting <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/01/26/cable-giants-insist-that-forcing-them-to-make-cancellations-easier-violates-their-first-amendment-rights/">FTC</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/12/21/the-gop-is-very-mad-because-the-fcc-wants-to-ban-shitty-cable-early-termination-fees/">FCC</a> plans to crack down on the billions of dollars cable companies make off of junk fees, again by claiming the agencies don’t have the legal authority to do their jobs. </p>
<p><strong>Here’s the thing</strong>: the FTC and FCC aren’t doing anything crazy here. They’re doing the <em>absolute bare minimum</em> when it comes to policing obnoxious, misleading fees, often used to help companies falsely advertise a lower price that <em>doesn’t actually exist</em>. And even here you can see how such efforts face an unrelenting legal and lobbying assault by companies with near-unlimited legal and lobbying budgets. </p>
<p>Now remember that the corrupt Supreme Court is on the precipice of <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/supreme-court-appears-poised-to-overrule-chevron-deference-in-judicial-power-grab/">dismantling Chevron</a>, a cornerstone of regulatory law as we know it, effectively undermining most existing independent regulatory authority. Once Chevron is dead, every last regulatory decision corporations don’t like will be challenged in court, and it will be left to a (potentially corrupt) judge to determine <a href="https://www.edf.org/media/supreme-court-will-hear-second-case-challenging-chevron-doctrine">what regulators can or can’t do</a>.</p>
<p>Picture this fight over fees. Now apply it to pretty much <strong>any</strong> regulatory effort to do <strong>anything</strong>. Then apply the assumption that corporations will win most of the time thanks to corrupt, unelected judges (often with lifetime appointments), and you’ll begin to see the full picture. </p>
<p>As it stands, Congress passes a (often vague and badly written) law, and it’s up to regulators with very tailored knowledge (on subjects ranging from wireless spectrum management to emission controls) to implement useful rules within the confines of the law. The axing of Chevron eliminates much of that independent authority, meaning they can’t do anything not <em>very specifically outlined</em> by Congress.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/opinion/supreme-court-chevron.html">flimsy underlying justification</a> for killing Chevron is that it rebalances the constitutional order, shifting power away from the Executive and back to Congress. In reality, corporations captured Congress long ago. They know it’s hard to get Congress to reform much of anything. Now they’re aiming to finish the job by all-but lobotomizing what’s left of regulatory independence (<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/09/26/biden-fcc-prepares-to-restore-net-neutrality-but-the-details-will-matter/">net neutrality was a lovely example</a>). </p>
<p>The goal is the final beheading of what’s left of the already undermanned and underfunded federal regulatory state. It’s the final killing blow of regulatory power at the hands of U.S. corruption, dressed up as a good faith effort to restore constitutional balance and free unfairly burdened corporations from the “tyranny” of already fairly feckless U.S. corporate oversight.</p>
<p>In reality, the axing of Chevron is going to result in gridlock in the courts, as every last regulatory decision corporations don’t like are challenged by corporations under the claim regulators have no authority. That’s going to result not only in the dismantling of existing consumer protections, environmental reforms, and public safety initiatives, but will chill any efforts to craft any new reforms.</p>
<p>That will shift most consumer protection to the handful of states that actually still care about such things. At that point, with federal regulatory oversight dead, corporations can shift all of their attention and resources toward undermining state regulatory power. Again, the goal here isn’t a good faith concern about free markets or constitutional balance, it’s <em>completely unchecked corporate power</em>. </p>
<p>The goal is handcuffing regulators’ hands behind their backs as the U.S. is scrapped and sold for parts out the back door, by men who can retreat to their private islands once the girders give way and the roof begins to collapse on the rest of us. Consumer protection, environmental law, election law, and public safety are facing an historic existential threat. </p>
<p>I don’t think most people really understand the scope and scale of what’s coming down the road once Chevron is dismantled. And I don’t expect the broken “both sides,” billionaire-owned U.S. press will make that threat clear to readers. </p>
<p>But I do think that the full impact of the Supreme Court’s looming decision will be painfully obvious to U.S. residents in the decade to come. At which point current debates — like the auto industry’s attempt to stop the FTC from policing predatory fees — will seem downright adorable by comparison. </p>

# Programming in 1969
<center>An interview with a pioneer (my mum)</center>

!!! Note
    I conducted this interview with my mother, Marianne Ernerfeldt, in December 2018.
    This is a slightly abridged English translation. The full interview can be [read in Swedish here](2019_07_08_programmering_1969.html).


## Why did you want to become a programmer?
I decided to become a programmer 1965-'66. I had read an article with a picture of a flowchart and I thought "this would suit me". When I graduated high school in 1967 there were no universities teaching programming, but there was a 6-month course in Solna that would become a 12-month course, and it was eligible for student loans. So I applied for that.

At the same time SJ (the Swedish state railway company, then a monopoly) advertised for a trainee program with a one year paid training program where you got to learn all the different parts of the SJ operations. SJ had a computer division, so I applied for the SJ program too with the hope of maybe ending up there.

However, SJ ended up with 700 applicants for 50 positions, so there was a tough selection process with various tests. And I got in! So because I needed the salary to get my own apartment, I accepted.

Incidentally, the SJ management was quite unhappy when they found out that the trainee program brochures had been sent out to both male *and female* students! There weren't many women who got accepted into the program, but we were a few.

During the training we went around to all divisions of SJ and learned about everything from the trains and rails to how the communications worked (SJ had its own electricity and phone lines!). After a year of that I got a job, but it was a boring job. Finally in 1969 I heard that SJ was starting an internal training program for programming, so I applied for that. After more tests I and three others started the programming training in 1969. We were two girls and two guys.

![My reference for IBM System/370 from 1976. To the right I have written in ÅÄÖ (Dec. 5B, 7B and 7C), because the Swedish letters were not part of EBCDIC.](2019_07_08_programming_1969/ibm_370_reference.jpg)


## What was the training like?
First we visited the SJ computer division and got a rundown of what computers are etc. Then we took classes at IBM who had an "training machine" in a huge building in Stockholm. We were maybe 50-100 people in the same class, but we were split up so that we were eight people in each room. There we watched two TV screens at the front of the classroom. The teacher and his blackboard were broadcast on the screens from another room. Each teacher had maybe ten rooms with students, and each room could ask questions using a microphone and call attention using a button. It was super modern!

First we learned a bit about IBM OS, and then we learned PL/I which was IBM's own programming language. It was a more modern version of Cobol with features that Cobol did not yet have (but would get later), like making tables and queries. So PL/I was a much better language back then and much simpler: you could write the code using English words, `DO WHILE` etc. A really nice programming language!

It was the government agencies that were at the forefront of data processing in Sweden. Banks and others came far behind. So at the IBM courses it was mostly people from other agencies, but SJ was at the forefront.

After the first IBM course I went back to SJ to do my first practice programs. The four of us made a dating program where you would input men and women and their traits, and then generate a good matching between them with an algorithm of our own invention. And after that we started writing production code!

Later I took more courses, for instance I learned assembler the same way. So my education was really a week here and a class there, and then we had a supervisor at work that helped us.

![My stencil for drawing flowcharts. Used to visualize how the data would flow and in which order things were to happen.](2019_07_08_programming_1969/flowchart_2.jpg width="480")


## What was your job like?
First we would draw flowcharts and then we would write the code using a pencil. We then handed the code to the puncher unit where the code would be punched onto punch cards. The punch cards had 80 columns – 72 for the program and 8 for sequencing – so each line of code could be at most 72 characters wide.

You had to write the code clearly so that the women operating the punchers could read it. After a few years as SJ we got someone dedicated to reading our code, and that helped a lot. Otherwise they would mostly punch data cards: time reports from SJ, how far each train carriage had traveled (so they could get called in for service), etc. The punch machine looked like a regular typewriter that would punch holes in the cards. Above each column it would also type the letter in clear text.

We also used to serve cake on punch cards, so they were quite versatile.

When I first started, the programs were small, but later they could be several meter-long boxes of cards. Each line of code became one punch card. So one instruction per line and card. So the puncher unit would return the program (thousands of cards) to us. We would also have to create "control cards" which encoded whether the punch cards were to be compiled or executed, and what language it was etc. The control cards had a separate color. The first card was a work card with my name on it, so they knew whom to return everything to.

We put the punch card boxes on a special table. The operators came wearing their white coats and took the boxes and ran the programs.

Sometimes we only got one run per day, because we programmers had the lowest priority in the machine hall. So we had to work on several programs simultaneously to keep busy.

Finally the cards were returned together with "pajama paper" containing lists with error codes and line numbers.

![Pajama paper](2019_07_08_programming_1969/pyjamaspapper.jpg width="480")

We had access to a couple of hole punches so we could make minor corrections ourselves.

Then we had to create test files and see if the program produced the expected result. If not you would sit and "desktop test" (think with pen and paper) and try to figure "what the hell went wrong?". So it could take quite a while to get a program right.

We had several machines. We had IBM 360 from the beginning as well as some even older machines. Later on we got IBM 370.

Towards the end of the 70's we got terminals. We never had our own terminals, but shared a terminal room. We had to fight over terminal time when we wanted to make changes to a program. The program would flash up on the screen, and we could modify it. We had Alfaskop terminals in yellow and brown. I never got my own terminal before quitting SJ in 1979.

![Alfaskop 3700 [(source)](http://www.veteranklubbenalfa.se/veteran/bildarkiv/70330006.htm)](2019_07_08_programming_1969/alfaskop_3700.jpg)


## Tell me about your colleagues
The computer division at SJ had around 40 programmers and system engineers. All my colleagues were, like me, trained in-house, with a few exceptions: there were a few people the same age as me who had gone the 6 month course in Solna I mentioned earlier. But otherwise there was no other way to learn this – it was a brand new profession! Some colleagues used to be engine drivers! Most did not even have a high school diploma.

The system engineers worked mostly with specifications, what the inputs and outputs of the programs were to be etc. As programmers, we were the problem solvers, making flowcharts and figuring out how to solve the task.

There were around 10 machine operators in the machine hall. They wore white coats and handled the tape storage, disks and fed the punch cards. We were rarely allowed to enter the inner sanctum of the machine hall. The entrance had a "Closed Shop" sign. The machine hall was big. The earlier machines (IBM 1400) took up 10-20 m², but later machines were small as refrigerators.

The punch unit was made up of 50 young women. If there were any visits to the computer section from other parts of SJ it was always the punch unit that was the most interesting, as most people at SJ were men!

Of the 40 programmers we were 5 or 6 women. I was part of the young gang, but most programmers were around 10 years older than me (I was born in 1947). Towards the end of the 1970's we got a few new recruits that had done 12-month training courses.

Before I started I met Solveig who worked at the SJ computer division. She told me all doors had signs saying "Miss X" or "Mrs. X", but the guys' doors had no corresponding information about marital status. The women had been so pissed off by this that they had unscrewed the signs. So when I started they just looked at me and said "I guess you don't want a Miss/Mrs either?". "No thanks!", I said.

## What kind of things did you do?
In the spring of 1969 – before I started – the SJ online booking was launched, with 24/7 uptime. It was extremely advanced for its time, and written entirely in assembler. This was one thing where SJ were really outstanding – there was no other company in Sweden that even came close to us. I was very lucky to get my education at a company that was such a trail blazer!

We created the programs, and once they were completed and tested we handed them off. Others were responsible for maintaining them, we just wrote new ones! Mostly it was programs that gathered statistics about the operations (e.g. payroll), and then those programs would be run at regular intervals (e.g. every month).

In 1979, after ten years at SJ, I quit to start working in the bank sector instead.

Got some severe burnout, quit, and now I’m working on my own products while doing consulting/contracting on the side through my agency. I live fulltime in an RV traveling the country and working remotely. At the moment, I never want to work for someone else again.</span></p></div></td></tr>

I built that because I thought a personal website maker made logical sense as an indie business, and I wanted a way to stay in touch with friends after I deleted social media. But, it's hard to scale  - user acquisition is the name of the game, willingness to pay is lower, the product isn't super differentiated, and I don't have a lot of experience in B2C. So, it makes money and continues to grow - but is small in absolute terms.<p>I decided to work on a more ambitious project that I had been thinking about for years, inspired by a product I wanted at my last startup, and by the chaos of being in 100+ slack channels at a previous job. I hate how people use Discord + Slack - they're good for urgent communications, but we need a "low-attention" version for important communications in communities and at work. So, I started building this product last Summer.</p><p>Booklet is an async, newsletter-first community platform [2]. Something like Google Groups with the polish of Slack. Booklet's far more complex than Postcard, but plays into my skills more - such as complex permissions systems, email marketing infrastructure, B2B sales, and being able to incorporate all the latest OpenAI goodies quickly. I launched it about three months ago, it has revenue, and I've been scrambling to build things in response to user feedback. I'm thinking of doing a bit of a relaunch next week as some foundational flows come together, such as full PWA support, search, and Stripe member sync.</p><p>Coincidentally - the project I launched to dogfood Booklet, called FRCTNL [3], is doing quite well. I had no intention of monetizing it, but I included a referral link to the accounting service I use. People have been using that referral link, and last quarter FRCTNL was my highest-earning product.</p><p>I'm sure in a few years I will have some great stories after the fact about the lessons I was missing in plain sight. But, things feel a little chaotic, uncertain, and fun at the moment. The core theme is building things that I want. My main insight so far has been to build unique, differentiated products that I want to use myself.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://postcard.page/" rel="nofollow">https://postcard.page</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://booklet.group/" rel="nofollow">https://booklet.group</a></p><p>[3] <a href="https://frctnl.xyz/" rel="nofollow">https://frctnl.xyz</a>

I'm trying to do more essay writing there [1]. Most indie makers seem to have some content strategy where they share their story. I avoid social media and don't desire to become a Youtuber, so I'm focusing on writing as a content channel. I'm focusing essays on my creative process, inspiration, and specific experiences as an operator - the stuff I want to read. I'm avoiding prospective predictions about the future, being negative (an actual self-imposed rule), and talking about things that feel more like theory than practice.<p>The next piece I plan to publish tomorrow will be a recap of a talk I gave over the weekend, covering how most of our knowledge work practices come from factories, and ways software engineers are at the forefront of changing those industrial-era practices.</p><p>P.S. - if you're ever in NYC, come join for a dinner of Dimes Square Ventures [2], which is a little community I run for local indie makers (using Booklet!)</p><p>[1] <a href="https://contraption.co/essays" rel="nofollow">https://contraption.co/essays</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://dimessquareventures.com/" rel="nofollow">https://dimessquareventures.com</a>

Other than that, your day-to-day work looks pretty much the same though. You're just sending monthly invoices to the same employer, typically a single one, sometimes for years on end.

As soon as you have multiple customers that you send invoices to with some regularity and you have autonomy would you pass the 'self employed' test in other countries. If you refer to them as your client and you only have one then you're technically an employee, if you refer to your contact at your client as 'your boss' then you also are an employee.<p>We have a lot of this in NL as well, the long term effect is the slow erosion of the social safety net. Because good luck if your client decides they no longer need your services, suddenly you find out what the downside of being self employed is. Nothing to fall back on. So save like your life depends on it.

It's not unusual eg. in the building sector (where large construction projects, not unlike software projects, can take years to complete).<p>Another common example is MDs - quite a lot of private doctor's offices are contracted by the National Health Fund, basically providing their services for the public healthcare that way.</p><p>Clearly having multiple customers isn't a reasonable requirement for a small company. Software engineering isn't like private residential plumbing - "sink drain unclogged, next please!" :)</p><p><i>&gt; good luck if your client decides they no longer need your services, suddenly you find out what the downside of being self employed is.</i></p><p>That goes without saying, and the same obviously applies if you're running a "regular" company, with employees, like a restaurant or whatever.</p><p>The risk is arguably even greater, as you will usually pile up some financial obligations (such as credits) and other commodities limiting your financial fluidity (remember Covid? Restaurant owners do).</p><p>By the way, you can insure yourself against loss of income. Many insurance companies offer this service.

We're at a point where most people in Poland do not believe in retirement system anymore, it's unsustainable and will crash or will be kept with social, minimal retirement, no matter what you paid in.

It's like: welfare/health care system is bad, taxes are not used well. Top earning knowledge workers want an exit hatch, let's cater for them and they can hop off the welfare tax system. This way they can also provide cheap prices to foreign companies.<p>So many problems. These are just top off my head:</p><p>- Countries should want internally organised production, strong companies with own IP, not one-man "companies" producing IP to external entities.</p><p>- Those foreign companies will switch to other countries with better prices (Asia, Africa) any time if their programming scene improves. It's not like they have stakes like when building a factory.</p><p>- Lot of people think they can invest better, create a better future pension for themselves. This is often  true, and why would we want to allow exits, further eroding the whole system? There should be a base pension fund with everyone involved.</p><p>&gt; the government loses oversight of actual corporate structures</p><p>To the government the company could be a 5 person shell, while it actually employs/pays salaries of 100s of families. Theoretically you could roll up the contracts, but that would be very complicated.

I'm not one of those people, choosing to build something that was, in retrospect, much too big of a project for one person. I probably also spent too much time polishing the product before commercializing it, likely due to a fear of failure.)</p><p>In 2019, the product was finally commercialized as a SaaS service. I remember thinking that I either wanted it to be a spectacular success, or a spectacular failure (so that I could focus on other things, after close to 20 years).</p><p>It was neither, but has been growing steadily ever since. I would have made much more money working for someone else, but the freedom is unparalleled. I get to set my own hours and focus on things I consider important. I enjoy doing everything from support calls and UX work to building a compiler and a type system (that I have mentioned before on HN).</p><p>I also have no one I need to answer to, other than our customers. That has been important over the past couple of years, when a series of health emergencies in my family has diverted my attention elsewhere. I have been very fortunate to be able to do so, focusing on what's important, without having to ask permission to cut down on work temporarily.</p><p>Overall, I wouldn't trade this for anything. This year, my product will gain a sister product in a more lucrative field (I'm hoping), and I have plans to commercialize my compiler, both as a service and as a traditionally-licensed library. So I'm excited to stay solo and keep working on building the business.

After only a couple of years in the software industry proper, though, I felt I had seen all I needed to see. Crunch time. Arbitrary, ill-informed management decisions. Management who didn't believe in the product the team was passionate about. Products canceled through no fault of anyone working on it. Office politics and bickering.<p>With my own business, I gain agency. If the product fails, it's because I failed to market it properly, or the product vision was bad and did not resonate with enough customers, or because I failed to execute on that vision. When all the decisions are out of your hands, and you can't even see what prompted them, they can feel capricious and arbitrary.</p><p>With my own business, I am in control. I don't have one boss, I have hundreds of them. And as long as I continue to provide them with value, I get to continue doing what I'm doing. I like those terms.

I couldn’t really travel because I needed a lab with test equipment. But I did double my previous salary north of 200k and I worked as much or as little as needed. It ended up being an average 40hr work week overall. The one thing I missed out on was equity. A decade without bonuses, RSUs, or options really set me back compared to my peers. Plus I hated having to stress about finding new contracts or if I was going to get cut loose. Finally I quit and went back to a big employer and I’m much happier to not have that financial stress and to have equity again.</span></p></div></td></tr>

The move will not apply to Paris residents’ parking.</p><p>Tony Renucci, director of the air quality campaign group Respire, said: “The result of the vote is a victory for Paris residents’ quality of life.” He added that Paris was sending a message that “the presence of these monsters on wheels was no longer desirable on our streets”.</p><p>Emmanuel Grégoire, Paris’s deputy mayor, posted on X as voting began: “Heavier, more dangerous, more polluting … SUVs are an environmental disaster.”</p><p>Last year, Paris held a similar vote on whether to ban <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/31/rented-e-scooters-cleared-from-paris-streets-on-eve-of-ban" data-link-name="in body link">rented electric scooters</a> and subsequently became the first European capital to do so. The turnout for that vote – 103,000 people, about 7% of registered voters – was higher than for the vote on SUVs.</p><p>Under Hidalgo, Paris has for years raised pressure on drivers by increasing parking costs and gradually banning diesel vehicles, while expanding the bicycle lane network in the congested capital. The city has reduced the number of on-street parking spaces in order to make drivers use underground parking. There was a 71% rise in the use of bikes between the end of the Covid lockdowns and 2023, city hall said.</p><p>Paris’s deputy mayor in charge of transport, David Belliard, of the Green party, said about 10% of vehicles in Paris would be hit by the higher parking fees, which could bring in up to €35m for the city each year.</p><p>The motorists’ lobby group 40 Millions d’Automobilistes had argued that drivers should be free to choose whatever vehicle they want, warning that the move to raise parking tariffs was unjustified and the work of “an ultra-urban and anti-car minority”.</p><p>Christophe Béchu, France’s environment minister, Christophe Béchu, told broadcaster RTL that the SUV surcharge amounted to “a kind of punitive environmentalism” – even if drivers should “opt for lighter vehicles”.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>These lecture notes — including figures — are made while attending the lecture and have not been edited afterwards.
To make note taking using LaTeX viable, I had four goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing text and mathematical formulas in LaTeX should be as fast as the lecturer writing on a blackboard: no delay is acceptable.</li>
<li>Drawing figures should be almost as fast as the lecturer.</li>
<li>Managing notes, i.e. adding a note, compiling all my notes, compiling the last two lectures, searching in notes, etc. should be easy and quick.</li>
<li>Annotating pdf documents using LaTeX should be possible for when I want to write notes alongside a pdf document.</li>
</ul>
<p>This blog post will focus on the first item: writing LaTeX.</p>

<h2 id="vim-and-latex">Vim and LaTeX</h2>
<p>For writing text and mathematical formulas in LaTeX, I use Vim.
Vim is a powerful general purpose text editor that’s very extensible.
I use it for writing code, LaTeX, markdown, … basically everything that’s text-based.
It has a fairly steep learning curve, but once you’ve got the basics down, it’s hard to get back to an editor without Vim keybindings.
Here’s what my screen looks like when I’m editing LaTeX:</p>

<p>On the left you see Vim and on the right my pdf viewer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zathura_(document_viewer)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Zathura</a>, which also has Vim-like keybindings.
I’m using Ubuntu with <a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">bspwm</a> as my window manager.
The LaTeX plugin I’m using in Vim is <a href="https://github.com/lervag/vimtex" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">vimtex</a>.
It provides syntax highlighting, table of contents view, synctex, etc.
Using <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">vim-plug</a>, I configured it as follows:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>Plug <span>'lervag/vimtex'</span>
<span>let</span> g<span>:</span>tex_flavor<span>=</span><span>'latex'</span>
<span>let</span> g<span>:</span>vimtex_view_method<span>=</span><span>'zathura'</span>
<span>let</span> g<span>:</span>vimtex_quickfix_mode<span>=</span><span>0</span>
<span>set</span> conceallevel<span>=</span><span>1</span>
<span>let</span> g<span>:</span>tex_conceal<span>=</span><span>'abdmg'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The last two lines configure the concealment.
This is a feature where LaTeX code is replaced or made invisible when your cursor is not on that line.
By making <code>\[</code>, <code>\]</code>, <code>$</code> invisible, they’re less obtrusive which gives you a better overview of the document. This feature also replaces <code>\bigcap</code> by by <code>∩</code>, <code>\in</code> by <code>∈</code> etc.
The following animation should make that clear.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/d362e0b837be308b0f8897482a331ec6/conceal.gif" alt="conceal"></p>
<p>With this set up, I come to the crux of this blog post: writing LaTeX as fast as the lecturer can write on the blackboard.
This is where snippets come into play.</p>
<h2 id="snippets">Snippets</h2>
<h3 id="whats-a-snippet">What’s a snippet?</h3>
<p>A snippet is a short reusable piece of text that can be triggered by some other text.
For example, when I type <code>sign</code> and press <kbd>Tab</kbd>, the word <code>sign</code> will be expanded to a signature:</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/5ab28b1ad6114b68f4ce459d4f89eeae/sign.gif" alt="sign"></p>
<p>Snippets can also be dynamic: when I type <code>today</code> and press <kbd>Tab</kbd>, the word <code>today</code> will be replaced by the current date, and <code>box</code> <kbd>Tab</kbd> becomes a box that automatically grows in size.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/1b6301a6561d104b4bc79654cb75470d/today.gif" alt="today"></p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/8b7caefc472eae0941f41365d16e8d2d/box.gif" alt="box"></p>
<p>You can even use one snippet inside another:</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/cdd1fded48947d163c2e5e6b974cfec0/todaybox.gif" alt="todaybox"></p>
<h3 id="using-ultisnips-to-create-snippets">Using UltiSnips to create snippets</h3>
<p>I use the plugin <a href="https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">UltiSnips</a> to manage my snippets. My configuration is</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>Plug <span>'sirver/ultisnips'</span>
<span>let</span> g<span>:</span>UltiSnipsExpandTrigger <span>=</span> <span>'&lt;tab&gt;'</span>
<span>let</span> g<span>:</span>UltiSnipsJumpForwardTrigger <span>=</span> <span>'&lt;tab&gt;'</span>
<span>let</span> g<span>:</span>UltiSnipsJumpBackwardTrigger <span>=</span> <span>'&lt;s-tab&gt;'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The code for the <code>sign</code> snippet is the following:</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>sign </span><span>"Signature"</span></span>
Yours sincerely,

Gilles Castel
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For dynamic snippets, you can put code between backticks <code>``</code> which will be run when the snippet is expanded.
Here, I’ve used bash to format the current date: <code>date + %F</code>.</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>today </span><span>"Date"</span></span>
`date +%F`
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also use Python inside a <code>`!p ... `</code> block.
Have a look at the code for the <code>box</code> snippet:</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>box </span><span>"Box"</span></span>
`<span>!p</span><span> snip<span>.</span>rv <span>=</span> <span>'┌'</span> <span>+</span> <span>'─'</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span>t<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>'┐'</span>`</span>
│ <span>$1</span> │
`<span>!p</span><span> snip<span>.</span>rv <span>=</span> <span>'└'</span> <span>+</span> <span>'─'</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span>t<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>'┘'</span>`</span>
<span>$0</span>
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These Python code blocks will be replaced by the value of the variable <code>snip.rv</code>.
Inside these blocks, you have access to the current state of the snippet, e.g. <code>t[1]</code> contains the first tab stop, <code>fn</code> the current filename, …</p>
<h2 id="latex-snippets">LaTeX snippets</h2>
<p>Using snippets, writing LaTeX is a lot faster than writing it by hand.
Especially some of the more complex snippets can save you a lot of time and frustration.  Let’s begin with some simple snippets.</p>
<h3 id="environments">Environments</h3>
<p>To insert an environment, all I have to do is type <code>beg</code> at the beginning of a line.
Then I type the name of the environment, which is mirrored in the <code>\end{}</code> command. Pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> places the cursor inside the newly created environment.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/d5ed641a9cb568d13dd56d98fec6376b/beginend.gif" alt="beginend"></p>
<p>The code for this snippet is the following.</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>beg </span><span>"begin{} / end{}"</span> <span>bA</span></span>
\begin{<span>$1</span>}
	<span>$0</span>
\end{<span>$1</span>}
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>b</code> means that this snippet will only be expanded at the beginning of a line and <code>A</code> stands for auto expand, which means I do not have to press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to expand the snippet. Tab stops — i.e. places you can jump to by pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> — are represented by <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, … and the last one with <code>$0</code>.</p>
<h3 id="inline-and-display-math">Inline and display math</h3>
<p>Two of my most frequently used snippets are <code>mk</code> and <code>dm</code>.
They’re the snippets responsible for starting math mode.
The first one is a snippet for inline math, the second one for displayed math.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/12a16b6a90c4d85a887c7cde0f18bb8c/mkdm.gif" alt="mkdm"></p>
<p>The snippet for inline math is ‘smart’: it knows when to insert a space after the dollar sign.
When I start typing a word directly behind the closing <code>$</code>, it adds a space.
However, when I type a non-word character, it does not add a space, which would be preferred for example in the case of <code>$p$-value</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/1172a1f556fd36b42f7c3642b3952e2c/mk_space.gif" alt="mk_space"></p>
<p>The code for this snippet is the following.</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>mk </span><span>"Math"</span> <span>wA</span></span>
$<span>${1}</span>$`<span>!p</span><span>
<span>if</span> t<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>and</span> t<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>not</span> <span>in</span> <span>[</span><span>','</span><span>,</span> <span>'.'</span><span>,</span> <span>'?'</span><span>,</span> <span>'-'</span><span>,</span> <span>' '</span><span>]</span><span>:</span>
    snip<span>.</span>rv <span>=</span> <span>' '</span>
<span>else</span><span>:</span>
    snip<span>.</span>rv <span>=</span> <span>''</span>
`</span><span>$2</span>
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>w</code> at the end of the first line means that this snippet will expand at word boundaries, so e.g. <code>hellomk</code> won’t expand, but <code>hello mk</code> will.</p>
<p>The snippet for displayed math is more simple, but it also is quite handy; it makes me never forget ending equations with a period.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/a682e97365ecfe19fe0c5bc08bacfec6/dm.gif" alt="dm"></p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>dm </span><span>"Math"</span> <span>wA</span></span>
\[
<span>$1</span>
.\] <span>$0</span>
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="sub--and-superscripts">Sub- and superscripts</h3>
<p>Another useful snippet is one for subscripts.
It changes changes <code>a1</code> to <code>a_1</code> and <code>a_12</code> to <code>a_{12}</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/f26633cb822c6b52d346dfbba6e1a1bd/subscripts.gif" alt="subscripts"></p>
<p>The code for this snippet uses a regular expression for its trigger.
It expands the snippet when you type a character followed by a digit, which encoded by <code>[A-Za-z]\d</code>, or a character followed by <code>_</code> and two digits: <code>[A-Za-z]_\d\d</code>.</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>'([A-Za-z])(\d)' </span><span>"auto subscript"</span> <span>wrA</span></span>
`<span>!p</span><span> snip<span>.</span>rv <span>=</span> match<span>.</span>group<span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>`_`!p snip<span>.</span>rv <span>=</span> match<span>.</span>group<span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>`</span>
<span>endsnippet</span>

<span>snippet <span>'([A-Za-z])_(\d\d)' </span><span>"auto subscript2"</span> <span>wrA</span></span>
`<span>!p</span><span> snip<span>.</span>rv <span>=</span> match<span>.</span>group<span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>`_<span>{</span>`!p snip<span>.</span>rv <span>=</span> match<span>.</span>group<span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>`</span>}
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When you wrap parts of a regular expression in a group using parenthesis, e.g. <code>(\d\d)</code>, you can use them in the expansion of the snippet via <code>match.group(i)</code> in Python.</p>
<p>As for superscripts, I use <code>td</code>, which becomes <code>^{}</code>.  However, for squared, cubed, complement and a handful of other common ones, I use dedicated snippets such as <code>sr</code>, <code>cb</code> and <code>comp</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/da855cd9e67c48f508fab5ddc8c877fe/superscripts.gif" alt="superscripts"></p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>sr </span><span>"^2"</span> <span>iA</span></span>
^2
<span>endsnippet</span>

<span>snippet <span>cb </span><span>"^3"</span> <span>iA</span></span>

<span>endsnippet</span>

<span>snippet <span>compl </span><span>"complement"</span> <span>iA</span></span>

<span>endsnippet</span>

<span>snippet <span>td </span><span>"superscript"</span> <span>iA</span></span>
^{<span>$1</span>}<span>$0</span>
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="fractions">Fractions</h3>
<p>One of my most convenient snippets is one for fractions. This makes the following expansions:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>//</code></td>
<td>→</td>
<td><code>\frac{}{}</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>3/</code></td>
<td>→</td>
<td><code>\frac{3}{}</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>4\pi^2/</code></td>
<td>→</td>
<td><code>\frac{4\pi^2}{}</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>(1 + 2 + 3)/</code></td>
<td>→</td>
<td><code>\frac{1 + 2 + 3}{}</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>(1+(2+3)/)</code></td>
<td>→</td>
<td><code>(1 + \frac{2+3}{})</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>(1 + (2+3))/</code></td>
<td>→</td>
<td><code>\frac{1 + (2+3)}{}</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/3f83f1bdc3078aa16382e80a276f199f/frac.gif" alt="frac"></p>
<p>The code for the first one is easy:</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>// </span><span>"Fraction"</span> <span>iA</span></span>
\\frac{<span>$1</span>}{<span>$2</span>}<span>$0</span>
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The second and third examples are made possible using regular expressions to match for expressions like <code>3/</code>, <code>4ac/</code>, <code>6\pi^2/</code>, <code>a_2/</code>, etc.</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>'((\d+)|(\d*)(\\)?([A-Za-z]+)((\^|_)(\{\d+\}|\d))*)/' </span><span>"Fraction"</span> <span>wrA</span></span>
\\frac{`<span>!p</span><span> snip<span>.</span>rv <span>=</span> match<span>.</span>group<span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>`</span>}{<span>$1</span>}<span>$0</span>
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, regular expressions can become quite overwhelming, but here’s a diagram that should explain it:</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/908df5ec254f9cd5b08b99b8a54318d0/regex.svg" alt="Diagram of the regular expression"></p>
<p>In the fourth and fifth cases, it tries to find the matching parenthesis. As this isn’t possible using the regular expression engine of UltiSnips, I resorted to using Python:</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>priority</span> 1000
<span>snippet <span>'^.*\)/' </span><span>"() Fraction"</span> <span>wrA</span></span>

`</span>{<span>$1</span>}<span>$0</span>
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The last snippet concerning fractions I’d like to share is one that uses your selection to make a fraction.  You can use it by first selecting some text, then pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd>, typing <code>/</code> and pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> again.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/0da01b9566dc437fabf0c563ed14941f/visualfrac.gif" alt="visualfrac"></p>
<p>The code makes use of the <code>${VISUAL}</code> variable that represents your selection.</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>/ </span><span>"Fraction"</span> <span>iA</span></span>
\\frac{<span>${VISUAL}</span>}{<span>$1</span>}<span>$0</span>
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="sympy-and-mathematica">Sympy and Mathematica</h3>
<p>Another cool — but less used — snippet is one that uses <a href="https://www.sympy.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sympy</a> to evaluate mathematical expressions. For example: <code>sympy</code> <kbd>Tab</kbd> expands to <code>sympy | sympy</code>, and <code>sympy 1 + 1 sympy</code> <kbd>Tab</kbd> expands to <code>2</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/8c8f143fdcdc2f3e6de9853cf7ea3def/sympy.gif" alt="sympy"></p>

<h3 id="postfix-snippets">Postfix snippets</h3>
<p>Some other snippets I find worth sharing are postfix snippets.
Examples of such snippets are <code>phat</code> → <code>\hat{p}</code> and <code>zbar</code> → <code>\overline{z}</code>.
A similar snippet is a postfix vector, for example <code>v,.</code> → <code>\vec{v}</code> and <code>v.,</code> → <code>\vec{v}</code>.
The order of <code>,</code> and <code>.</code> doesn’t matter, so I can press them both at the same time.
These snippets are a real time-saver, because you can type in the same order the lecturer writes on the blackboard.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/7c2e62aae292bc4d65eae363c816e206/barhatvec.gif" alt="barhatvec"></p>
<p>Note that I can still use <code>bar</code> and <code>hat</code> prefix too, as I’ve added them with a lower priority.
The code for those snippets is:</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>priority</span> 10
<span>snippet <span>"bar" </span><span>"bar"</span> <span>riA</span></span>

<h3 id="other-snippets">Other snippets</h3>
<p>I have about 100 other commonly used snippets.
They are available <a href="https://github.com/gillescastel/latex-snippets" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
Most of them are quite simple.
For example, <code>!&gt;</code> becomes <code>\mapsto</code>, <code>-&gt;</code> becomes <code>\to</code>, etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/4ee36ef41c17f1ded1fffe13ba32b60d/complex5.gif" alt="complex5"></p>
<p><code>fun</code> becomes <code>f: \R \to \R :</code>, <code>!&gt;</code> → <code>\mapsto</code>, <code>-&gt;</code> → <code>\to</code>, <code>cc</code> → <code>\subset</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/a45092c95d91059b779f74cedda840e1/fun3.gif" alt="fun3"></p>
<p><code>lim</code> becomes <code>\lim_{n \to \infty}</code>, <code>sum</code> → <code>\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}</code>, <code>ooo</code> → <code>\infty</code></p>

<h3 id="course-specific-snippets">Course specific snippets</h3>
<p>Beside my commonly used snippets, I also have course specific snippets.
These are loaded by adding the following to my <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code><span>set</span> <span>rtp</span><span>+=</span>~<span>/</span>current_course</code></pre></div>
<p>where <code>current_course</code> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">symlink</a> to my currently activated course (more about that in another blog post).
In that folder, I have a file <code>~/current_course/UltiSnips/tex.snippets</code> in which I include course specific snippets. For example, for quantum mechanics, I have snippets for bra/ket notation.</p>
<table>

<p>As <code>\psi</code> is used a lot in quantum mechanics, I replace all instances of <code>q</code> in a braket with <code>\psi</code> when expanded.</p>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<p>One thing to consider when writing these snippets is, ‘will these snippets collide with usual text?’
For example, according to my dictionary, there are about 72 words in English and 2000 words in Dutch that contain <code>sr</code>, which means that while I’m typing the word <code>disregard</code>, the <code>sr</code> would expand to <code>^2</code>, giving me <code>di^2egard</code>.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is adding a <em>context</em> to snippets. Using the syntax highlighting of Vim, it can be determined whether or not UltiSnips should expand the snippet depending if you’re in math or text. Add the following to the top of your snippets file:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>global</span> !p
<span>def</span> <span>math</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> vim<span>.</span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>'vimtex#syntax#in_mathzone()'</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>'1'</span>

<span>def</span> <span>comment</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> 
    <span>return</span> vim<span>.</span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>'vimtex#syntax#in_comment()'</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>'1'</span>

<span>def</span> <span>env</span><span>(</span>name<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>[</span>x<span>,</span>y<span>]</span> <span>=</span> vim<span>.</span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>"vimtex#env#is_inside('"</span> <span>+</span> name <span>+</span> <span>"')"</span><span>)</span> 
    <span>return</span> x <span>!=</span> <span>'0'</span> <span>and</span> x <span>!=</span> <span>'0'</span>

endglobal</code></pre></div>
<p>Now you can add <code>context "math()"</code> to the snippets you’d only want to expand in a mathematical context.</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>context</span> "math()"
<span>snippet <span>sr </span><span>"^2"</span> <span>iA</span></span>
^2
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that a ‘mathematical context’ is a subtle thing.
Sometimes you add some text inside a math environment by using <code>\text{...}</code>.
In that case, you do not want snippets to expand.
However, in the following case: <code>\[ \text{$...$} \]</code>, they <em>should</em> expand.
The following animation illustrates these subtleties.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/e1b3ca2dd4fc1f5fe39679fb6ba38aad/syntaxtree.gif" alt="syntaxtree"></p>
<p>Similarly, you can add <code>context "env('itemize')"</code> to snippets that only should expand in an <code>itemize</code> environment or <code>context "comment()"</code> for snippets in comments.</p>

<h2 id="correcting-spelling-mistakes-on-the-fly">Correcting spelling mistakes on the fly</h2>
<p>While inserting mathematics is an important part of my note-taking setup, most of the time I’m typing English. At about 80 words per minute, my typing skills are not bad, but I still make a lot of typos.
This is why I added a keybinding to Vim that corrects the spelling mistakes, without interrupting my flow. When I press <kbd>Ctrl+L</kbd> while I’m typing, the previous spelling mistake is corrected. It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/0add705683b79cb94498104251a6d5b8/spellcheck.gif" alt="spellcheck"></p>
<p>My configuration for spell check is the following:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code><span>setlocal</span> <span>spell</span>
<span>set</span> <span>spelllang</span><span>=</span>nl<span>,</span>en_gb
inoremap <span>&lt;</span>C<span>-</span><span>l</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>c</span><span>-</span>g<span>&gt;</span><span>u</span><span>&lt;</span>Esc<span>&gt;</span><span>[</span>s1z<span>=</span>`<span>]</span>a<span>&lt;</span><span>c</span><span>-</span>g<span>&gt;</span><span>u</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It basically jumps to the previous spelling mistake <code>[s</code>, then picks the first suggestion <code>1z=</code>, and then jumps back <code>`]a</code>. The <code>&lt;c-g&gt;u</code> in the middle make it possible to undo the spelling correction quickly.</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>
<p>Using snippets in Vim, writing LaTeX is no longer an annoyance, but rather a pleasure.
In combination with spell check on the fly, it allows for a comfortable mathematical note-taking setup.
A few pieces are missing though, for example drawing figures digitally and embedding them in a LaTeX document. This is a topic I’d like to tackle in a future blog post.</p>

    <article itemprop="text"><h4 dir="auto">Gin, Television, and Social Surplus, or, “Looking for the Mouse”</h4>
<h5 dir="auto">Clay Shirky / April 26, 2008</h5>
<p dir="auto"><em>transcription of a speech [Clay Shirky] gave at the Web 2.0 in 2008, emphasis by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jm3" rel="nofollow">@jm3</a></em></p>
<p dir="auto">I was recently reminded of some reading I did in college, way back in the last century, by a British historian arguing that the critical technology, for the early phase of the industrial revolution, was <strong>gin</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The transformation from rural to urban life was so sudden, and so wrenching, that the only thing society could do to manage was to drink itself into a stupor for a generation. The stories from that era are amazing-- there were gin pushcarts working their way through the streets of London.</p>
<p dir="auto">And it wasn't until society woke up from that collective bender that we actually started to get the institutional structures that we associate with the industrial revolution today. Things like public libraries and museums, increasingly broad education for children, elected leaders--a lot of things we like -- didn't happen until having all of those people together <strong>stopped seeming like a crisis and started seeming like an asset.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">It wasn't until people started thinking of this as a vast civic surplus, one they could design for rather than just dissipate, that we started to get what we think of now as an industrial society.</p>
<p dir="auto">If I had to pick the critical technology for the 20th century, the bit of social lubricant without which the wheels would've come off the whole enterprise, I'd say it was <strong>the sitcom</strong>. Starting with the Second World War a whole series of things happened--rising GDP per capita, rising educational attainment, rising life expectancy and, critically, a rising number of people who were working five-day work weeks. For the first time, society forced onto an enormous number of its citizens the requirement to manage something they had never had to manage before -- <strong>free time</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">And what did we do with that free time? Well, mostly we spent it watching TV.</p>
<p dir="auto">We did that for decades. We watched I Love Lucy. We watched Gilligan's Island. We watch Malcolm in the Middle. We watch Desperate Housewives. Desperate Housewives essentially functioned as a kind of <strong>cognitive heat sink</strong>, dissipating thinking that might otherwise have built up and caused society to overheat.</p>
<p dir="auto">And it's only now, as we're waking up from that collective bender, that we're starting to see the cognitive surplus as an asset rather than as a crisis. We're seeing things being designed to take advantage of that surplus, to deploy it in ways more engaging than just having a TV in everybody's basement.</p>
<p dir="auto">This hit me in a conversation I had about two months ago. As Jen said in the introduction, I've finished a book called Here Comes Everybody, which has recently come out, and this recognition came out of a conversation I had about the book. I was being interviewed by a TV producer to see whether I should be on their show, and she asked me, "What are you seeing out there that's interesting?"</p>
<p dir="auto">I started telling her about the Wikipedia article on Pluto. You may remember that Pluto got kicked out of the planet club a couple of years ago, so all of a sudden there was all of this activity on Wikipedia. The talk pages light up, people are editing the article like mad, and the whole community is in an ruckus -- "How should we characterize this change in Pluto's status?" And a little bit at a time they move the article -- fighting offstage all the while -- from, "Pluto is the ninth planet," to "Pluto is an odd-shaped rock with an odd-shaped orbit at the edge of the solar system."</p>
<p dir="auto">So I tell her all this stuff, and I think, "Okay, we're going to have a conversation about authority or social construction or whatever." That wasn't her question. She heard this story and she shook her head and said, "Where do people find the time?" That was her question. <em>And I just kind of snapped. And I said, <strong>"No one who works in TV gets to ask that question. You know where the time comes from. It comes from the cognitive surplus you've been masking for 50 years.</strong>"</em></p>
<p dir="auto">So how big is that surplus? So if you take Wikipedia as a kind of unit, all of Wikipedia, the whole project -- every page, every edit, every talk page, every line of code, in every language that Wikipedia exists in -- that represents something like the cumulation of <strong>100 million hours</strong> of human thought. I worked this out with Martin Wattenberg at IBM; it's a back-of-the-envelope calculation, but it's the right order of magnitude, about 100 million hours of thought.</p>
<p dir="auto">And television watching? Two hundred <strong>billion</strong> hours, in the U.S. alone, every year. Put another way, now that we have a unit, that's <strong>2,000 Wikipedia projects a year spent watching television</strong>. Or put still another way, in the U.S., we spend 100 million hours every weekend, just watching the ads. This is a pretty big surplus. People asking, "Where do they find the time?" when they're looking at things like Wikipedia <em>don't understand</em> how tiny that entire project is, as a carve-out of this asset that's finally being dragged into what Tim calls an architecture of participation.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, the interesting thing about a surplus like that is that society doesn't know what to do with it at first -- hence the gin, hence the sitcoms. <em>Because if people knew what to do with a surplus with reference to the existing social institutions,</em> <strong>then it wouldn't be a surplus, would it</strong>? It's precisely when no one has any idea how to deploy something that people have to start experimenting with it, in order for the surplus to get integrated, and the course of that integration can transform society.</p>
<p dir="auto">The early phase for taking advantage of this cognitive surplus, the phase I think we're still in, is all special cases. The physics of participation is much more like the physics of weather than it is like the physics of gravity. We know all the forces that combine to make these kinds of things work: there's an interesting community over here, there's an interesting sharing model over there, those people are collaborating on open source software. But despite knowing the inputs, we can't predict the outputs yet because there's so much complexity.</p>
<p dir="auto">The way you explore complex ecosystems is you just try lots and lots and lots of things, and you hope that everybody who fails fails informatively so that you can at least find a skull on a pikestaff near where you're going. That's the phase we're in now.</p>
<p dir="auto">Just to pick one example, one I'm in love with, but it's tiny. A couple of weeks one of my students at ITP forwarded me a a project started by a professor in Brazil, in Fortaleza, named Vasco Furtado. It's a Wiki Map for crime in Brazil. If there's an assault, if there's a burglary, if there's a mugging, a robbery, a rape, a murder, you can go and put a push-pin on a Google Map, and you can characterize the assault, and you start to see a map of where these crimes are occurring.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, this already exists as tacit information. Anybody who knows a town has some sense of, "Don't go there. That street corner is dangerous. Don't go in this neighborhood. Be careful there after dark." But it's something society knows without society really knowing it, which is to say there's no public source where you can take advantage of it. And the cops, if they have that information, they're certainly not sharing. In fact, one of the things Furtado says in starting the Wiki crime map was, "This information may or may not exist some place in society, but it's actually easier for me to try to rebuild it from scratch than to try and get it from the authorities who might have it now."</p>
<p dir="auto">Maybe this will succeed or maybe it will fail. The normal case of social software is still failure; most of these experiments don't pan out. But the ones that do are quite incredible, and I hope that this one succeeds, obviously. But even if it doesn't, it's illustrated the point already, which is that someone working alone, with really cheap tools, has a reasonable hope of carving out enough of the cognitive surplus, enough of the desire to participate, enough of the collective goodwill of the citizens, to create a resource you couldn't have imagined existing even five years ago.</p>
<p dir="auto">So that's the answer to the question, "Where do they find the time?" Or, rather, that's the numerical answer. But beneath that question was another thought, this one not a question but an observation. In this same conversation with the TV producer I was talking about World of Warcraft guilds, and as I was talking, I could sort of see what she was thinking:</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>"Losers. Grown men sitting in their basement pretending to be elves."</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>At least they're doing something.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Did you ever see that episode of Gilligan's Island where they almost get off the island and then Gilligan messes up and then they don't? I saw that one. I saw that one a lot when I was growing up. And every half-hour that I watched that was a half an hour I wasn't posting at my blog or editing Wikipedia or contributing to a mailing list. Now I had an ironclad excuse for not doing those things, which is none of those things existed then. I was forced into the channel of media the way it was because it was the only option. Now it's not, and that's the big surprise. However lousy it is to sit in your basement and pretend to be an elf, I can tell you from personal experience it's worse to sit in your basement and try to figure if Ginger or Mary Ann is cuter.</p>
<p dir="auto">And I'm willing to raise that to a general principle. It's better to do something than to do nothing. Even lolcats, even cute pictures of kittens made even cuter with the addition of cute captions, hold out an invitation to participation. When you see a lolcat, one of the things it says to the viewer is, "If you have some sans-serif fonts on your computer, you can play this game, too." And that's message -- I can do that, too -- is a big change.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is something that people in the media world don't understand. Media in the 20th century was run as a single race -- <strong>consumption</strong>. <em>How much can we produce? How much can you consume? Can we produce more and you'll consume more?</em> And the answer to that question has generally been yes. But media is actually a triathlon, it's three different events. People like to consume, <strong>but they also like to produce, and they like to share</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">And what's astonished people who were committed to the structure of the previous society, prior to trying to take this surplus and do something interesting, is that they're discovering that when you offer people the opportunity to produce and to share, they'll take you up on that offer. It doesn't mean that we'll never sit around mindlessly watching Scrubs on the couch. It just means we'll do it less.</p>
<p dir="auto">And this is the other thing about the size of the cognitive surplus we're talking about. It's so large that even a small change could have huge ramifications. Let's say that everything stays 99 percent the same, that people watch 99 percent as much television as they used to, but 1 percent of that is carved out for producing and for sharing. The Internet-connected population watches roughly a trillion hours of TV a year. That's about five times the size of the annual U.S. consumption. <strong>One per cent of that is 100 Wikipedia projects per year worth of participation.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">I think that's going to be a big deal. Don't you?</p>
<p dir="auto">Well, the TV producer did not think this was going to be a big deal; she was not digging this line of thought. And her final question to me was essentially, "Isn't this all just a fad?" You know, sort of the flagpole-sitting of the early early 21st century? It's fun to go out and produce and share a little bit, but then people are going to eventually realize, "This isn't as good as doing what I was doing before," and settle down. And I made a spirited argument that no, this wasn't the case, that this was in fact a big one-time shift, more analogous to the industrial revolution than to flagpole-sitting.</p>
<p dir="auto">I was arguing that this isn't the sort of thing society grows out of. It's the sort of thing that society grows into. But I'm not sure she believed me, in part because she didn't want to believe me, but also in part because I didn't have the right story yet. And now I do.</p>
<p dir="auto">I was having dinner with a group of friends about a month ago, and one of them was talking about sitting with his four-year-old daughter watching a DVD. And in the middle of the movie, apropos nothing, she jumps up off the couch and runs around behind the screen. That seems like a cute moment. Maybe she's going back there to see if Dora is really back there or whatever. But that wasn't what she was doing. She started rooting around in the cables. And her dad said, "What you doing?" And she stuck her head out from behind the screen and said, "<em>Looking for the mouse</em>."</p>
<p dir="auto">Here's something four-year-olds know: <strong>A screen that ships without a mouse ships broken</strong>. Here's something four-year-olds know: <strong>Media that's targeted <em>at</em> you but that doesn't <em>include</em> you may not be worth sitting still for</strong>. Those are things that make me believe that this is a one-way change. Because four year olds, the people who are soaking most deeply in the current environment, who won't have to go through the trauma that I have to go through of trying to unlearn a childhood spent watching Gilligan's Island, <strong>they just assume that media includes consuming, producing and sharing</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's also become my motto, when people ask me what we're doing -- and when I say "we" I mean the larger society trying to figure out how to deploy this cognitive surplus, but I also mean we, especially, the people in this room, the people who are working hammer and tongs at figuring out the next good idea. From now on, that's what I'm going to tell them: We're looking for the mouse. We're going to look at every place that a reader or a listener or a viewer or a user has been locked out, has been served up passive or a fixed or a canned experience, and ask ourselves, <em><strong>"If we carve out a little bit of the cognitive surplus and deploy it here, could we make a good thing happen?</strong></em>" And I'm betting the answer is yes.</p>
<p dir="auto">Thank you very much.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2023, Deno shifted into high gear with respect to Node/npm compatibility and
performance work, while continuing to move towards our goal of radically
simplifying web development. Here’s a summary of what changed in 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deno now understands <code>package.json</code> files and has the ability to import
<strong>built-in Node modules</strong> using <code>node:</code> specifiers like <code>node:fs</code> and
<code>node:crypto</code>. <a href="#enhanced-compatibility-with-node-and-npm">Read more.</a></li>
<li>A new web server API,
<a href="#simpler-faster-web-server-with-denoserve"><code>Deno.serve</code>, was stabilized</a> and
HTTP throughput improved ~73% over the year.</li>
<li><strong><code>deno compile</code></strong> got support for
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.32#deno-compile-support-for-web-workers-and-dynamic-import" rel="noopener noreferrer">workers, dynamic imports</a>,
and <a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.34#deno-compile-supports-npm-packages" rel="noopener noreferrer">npm modules</a>.</li>
<li>Deno made better use of <strong>web streams</strong> (<code>ReadableStream</code> and
<code>WriteableStream</code>) and <code>AbortController</code> throughout its APIs to narrow the gap
between browser and server-side programming.</li>
<li><a href="#more-flexible-denojson">Deno’s configuration file, <code>deno.json</code> , now doubles as an import map</a>.
We flattened the schema, added glob support, and a useful top-level
<code>"exclude"</code> attribute — all which allows for terse adjustments to how Deno is
executed.</li>
<li><a href="#jupyter-notebooks"><strong>Jupyter</strong>, the open source notebook tool, added support for JavaScript and TypeScript using Deno</a></li>
<li><a href="#webgpu"><strong>WebGPU</strong> was finally added to Deno</a> after nearly a year of
development.</li>
<li>Deno’s <strong>zero configuration TypeScript</strong> got better editor integration with
<a href="#smoother-development-experience-with-lsp">substantial improvements in the LSP and VS Code integration</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#fresh"><strong>Fresh</strong>, the Deno native web framework grew in functionality</a> with
proper Tailwind support, Partials, and layout files.</li>
<li><a href="#expanding-denos-cloud-business"><strong>Deno Deploy</strong> became more powerful</a> with
globally distributed primatives: <strong>Deno KV, Queues, Cron</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="#expanding-denos-cloud-business">We released <strong>self-service Subhosting</strong></a> for
platforms looking to deploy and execute untrusted multi-tenant JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s dive deeper into the changes below.</p>
<h2 id="enhanced-compatibility-with-node-and-npm">Enhanced Compatibility with Node and npm</h2><p>In a significant move toward ecosystem harmony, Deno expanded its capabilities
in 2023 by incorporating built-in Node modules, such as <code>node:fs</code> and
<code>node:child_process</code>, accessible through the <code>node:</code> specifier. This addition
builds on the native npm support introduced in late 2022, using the <code>npm:</code>
specifier, further bridging the gap between Deno and the Node ecosystem. As of
now, Deno boasts
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/node/compatibility" rel="noopener noreferrer">partial or full support for 38 of the 42 Node built-in APIs</a>,
marking a substantial stride in compatibility.</p>
<p>To facilitate a smoother transition from Node to Deno, we introduced several new
features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/tools/unstable_flags#--unstable-byonm" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>--unstable-byonm</code> flag</a>
allows the use of your preferred npm package manager within Deno, enhancing
flexibility.</li>
<li>With
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/tools/unstable_flags#--unstable-sloppy-imports" rel="noopener noreferrer">the <code>--unstable-sloppy-imports</code> flag</a>,
we’ve relaxed the strictness of module imports, accommodating a wider range of
coding styles and practices.</li>
<li>The
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/tools/unstable_flags#--unstable-unsafe-proto" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>--unstable-unsafe-proto</code> flag</a>
introduces support for <code>Object.prototype.__proto__</code>, a feature upon which
numerous npm packages depend.</li>
</ul>
<p>These enhancements are particularly useful for developers looking to run
existing Node projects in Deno without extensive modifications.</p>
<p>A notable advancement in the past year was the
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.31#stabilization-of-node-api" rel="noopener noreferrer">stabilization of the Node-API</a>. This
development eliminates the need for the <code>--unstable</code> flag when utilizing npm
packages dependent on Node-API, thereby broadening the range of supported npm
packages and streamlining the integration process.</p>
<h2 id="simpler-faster-web-server-with-denoserve">Simpler, faster web server with <code>Deno.serve()</code></h2><p>We’ve significantly streamlined web server creation in Deno by introducing and
stabilizing the <code>Deno.serve()</code> function, allowing developers to launch a server
with minimal code:</p>
<div><pre><span>Deno</span><span>.</span><span>serve</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Response</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div><p>This enhancement is part of our ongoing commitment to simplify development
processes and reduce the need for extensive boilerplate code. The <code>Deno.serve()</code>
function embodies this philosophy, enabling efficient and concise server setup.</p>
<p>Performance has seen substantial improvements through targeted optimizations in
the core libraries and the event loop mechanism. In benchmark tests using a
basic “Hello, world” server setup, Deno’s HTTP throughput has seen remarkable
gains, nearly doubling since late 2023. When compared to a similar Node.js
server, Deno now demonstrates a ~61% increase in throughput, alongside notable
enhancements in tail latency and memory efficiency.</p>
<figure>

<p><img src="https://deno.com/blog/deno-in-2023/http-benchmark.png" alt="HTTP benchmark in requests per second" title=""></p>
<figcaption>Run on bare metal 8 core,  64GB ram, Intel Xeon E-2378G with `wrk -d 10s`</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>These advancements are not limited to Deno-specific projects; they extend to
modules and applications utilizing the <code>node:http</code> module, thanks to
<code>Deno.serve</code>’s underlying architecture.</p>
<p>A key factor in these performance gains is the improved integration of Deno’s
HTTP interfaces with the <a href="https://hyper.rs/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyper</a> and
<a href="https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reqwest</a> libraries. This integration
has minimized unnecessary data allocation and duplication across different
layers of the Deno runtime.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we’ve optimized the Deno event loop, responsible for managing
asynchronous operations and resource monitoring, to reduce overhead and enhance
the runtime’s overall efficiency. These collective improvements underscore our
dedication to providing a robust, high-performance environment for web
development.</p>
<h2 id="more-flexible-denojson">More flexible <code>deno.json</code></h2><p>At Deno, we stand by the principle of zero-configuration programming,
particularly valuing the simplicity of single-file programs, even for those
written in TypeScript. Recognizing that larger projects often demand more
sophisticated setups, we’ve continuously improved our optional <code>deno.json</code>
configuration file to meet these complex needs without sacrificing ease of use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Streamlined Configuration</strong>: We’ve transformed <code>deno.json</code> to double as an
import map, effectively reducing the need for separate configuration files and
simplifying project setups.
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.30#denojson-becomes-an-import-map" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more about import maps</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Formatting Options</strong>: <code>deno fmt</code> now supports semicolons, offering
more flexibility in code styling to accommodate diverse developer preferences.</li>
<li><strong>Node and npm Compatibility</strong>: Integration with <code>package.json</code> enhances
compatibility, making it easier for projects to transition between Node and
Deno environments.
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.31#packagejson-support" rel="noopener noreferrer">See how we improved compatibility</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified Configuration Structure</strong>: We’ve flattened the <code>deno.json</code>
structure, making it more intuitive and easier to navigate for developers.
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.33#flatter-denojson-configuration" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discover the simpler structure</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Glob Support</strong>: The introduction of glob patterns in <code>deno.json</code> allows for
more precise control over file and directory inclusion or exclusion in various
operations such as formatting, linting, and testing.
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.34#glob-support-in-denojson-and-cli-flags" rel="noopener noreferrer">Explore glob support details</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These enhancements are part of our ongoing commitment to making Deno not only
powerful and versatile for large-scale applications but also simple and
accessible for smaller projects.</p>
<h2 id="smoother-development-experience-with-lsp">Smoother development experience with LSP</h2><p>Deno’s Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration elevates the development
experience within editors and IDEs, offering robust features like precise
go-to-definition, comprehensive IntelliSense, and seamless code formatting for
TypeScript projects. This year, we’ve dedicated significant effort to enhance
the LSP, making coding in Deno smoother and more intuitive:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extended Auto-Complete</strong>: Now includes support for <code>npm:</code> and <code>node:</code>
specifiers, streamlining the use of Node modules within Deno.</li>
<li><strong>VSCode Extension Activation</strong>: The Deno VSCode extension is now triggered
automatically when a <code>deno.json</code> file is detected in your project, ensuring
immediate access to Deno’s powerful tooling.</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent Import Management</strong>: Imports in TypeScript and JavaScript files
are now updated automatically when files are renamed, maintaining code
consistency and reducing manual refactoring.</li>
<li><strong>Efficient Document Pre-Loading</strong>: Ensures features like “find references”
work seamlessly across all files in a project, enhancing code navigation and
understanding.</li>
</ul>
<p>To fully leverage these improvements, try the
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno extension for Visual Studio Code</a>,
designed to integrate these enhancements directly into your development
workflow.</p>
<h2 id="webgpu">WebGPU</h2><p>Deno has now integrated
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebGPU</a>, a
cutting-edge technology that empowers developers to harness the power of GPU
hardware directly with JavaScript. This high-performance, low-level interface is
designed for a wide range of applications, from graphics rendering to data
analysis, and machine learning, all within the familiar environment of
web-standard JavaScript.</p>
<p>After a year of dedicated development, WebGPU is accessible in Deno behind the
<code>--unstable-webgpu</code> flag, marking a significant milestone in expanding the
capabilities of Deno applications. This feature is especially promising for
developers looking to push the boundaries of what’s possible with JavaScript in
areas requiring intense computational power.</p>
<p>We are also actively developing features to enable WebGPU for rendering in
native GUI windows, further broadening the potential use cases for Deno
developers.
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.40#webgpu-windowing--bring-your-own-window" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stay updated on this feature’s progress</a>.</p>
<p>To explore practical applications and see WebGPU in action within Deno, visit
our <a href="https://github.com/denoland/webgpu-examples" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebGPU examples repository</a>,
which provides a variety of sample projects and code snippets.</p>
<h2 id="jupyter-notebooks">Jupyter notebooks</h2><p><a href="https://jupyter.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jupyter</a>, the open source notebook tool, added support
for JavaScript and TypeScript using Deno. This means data science,
visualization, and more can all be done using modern JavaScript and TypeScript
and web standards APIs.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of grabbing data with <code>fetch</code> and visualizing it with
<code>observablehq/plot</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://deno.com/blog/deno-in-2023/jupyter-scatter-plot.png" alt="A scatter plot in Jupyter notebooks using TypeScript with Deno" title=""></p>
<p>Jupyter support has also enabled building generative AI/ML models using
JavaScript and TypeScript, as Andrew Ng and DeepLearning.AI have developed
<a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/build-llm-apps-with-langchain-js/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a generative AI course on building LLM Apps with LangChain.js</a>
that uses Deno.</p>
<h2 id="notable-open-source-rust-crates">Notable open source rust crates</h2><p>Deno’s surface area touches a wide range of open source projects, which we
eagerly contribute to in order to expand Deno’s feature set and optimize
performance. This year, we released a few Rust crates that developers might find
useful independently of Deno itself:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/denoland/rustls-tokio-stream" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>rustls-tokio-stream</code></a> a
Rust crate that replaces tokio-rustls adding more advanced features like
supporting duplex I/O via&nbsp;<code>tokio::io::split</code>. Critically it does not require
either read or write polling to perform handshakes.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/denoland/fastwebsockets" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>fastwebsockets</code></a>&nbsp;is a minimal,
fast WebSocket server implementation that sits behind Deno’s WebSocket
implementation. It completely passes the&nbsp;Autobahn TestSuite&nbsp;and fuzzed with
LLVM’s&nbsp;libfuzzer. You can use it as a raw websocket frame parser and deal with
spec compliance yourself, or you can use it as a full-fledged websocket
server.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/denoland/monch" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>monch</code></a> is a parser inspired
by&nbsp;<a href="https://crates.io/crates/nom" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>nom</code></a>, but specifically for strings and
with some additional combinators we use in Deno. It backs <code>deno_task_shell</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno_task_shell" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>deno_task_shell</code></a> is a cross
platform shell implementation that helps <code>deno task</code> run across windows and
unix. Think of it as a more advanced version of the common Node.js utility
<code>cross-env</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fresh">Fresh</h2><p>We continued to make&nbsp;<a href="https://fresh.deno.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fresh</a>, Deno’s modern full stack
web framework that sends zero client-side JavaScript by default, easier to use
and more performant.</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve added support
for&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.4#layouts" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>_layout</code>&nbsp;files to allow for sharing components across routes</a>,
increased flexibility
in&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.4#organise-your-code-with-route-groups" rel="noopener noreferrer">organizing code with route groups</a>,
and removed boilerplate in passing data from a route handler to a component by
introducing&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.3#async-route-components" rel="noopener noreferrer">async route components</a>.
We
also&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.3#fresh-linting-rules" rel="noopener noreferrer">improved linting rules and error messages in the editor</a>,
as well
as&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.2#simplified-testing-of-fresh-projects" rel="noopener noreferrer">simplified testing</a>.</li>
<li>Islands, the core of Fresh’s design, also received a ton of new features
making it more robust so it can handle a wider range of use cases.
We&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.2#passing-signals-uint8arrays-and-circular-data-in-island-props" rel="noopener noreferrer">broadened the kinds of data that you could pass to island props</a>&nbsp;to
include Preact Signals, JSX, JSON, and more. Also, islands can
now&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.2#passing-jsx-to-islands-and-nesting-islands-within-each-other" rel="noopener noreferrer">be nested</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.2#subdirectories-in-the-islands-folder" rel="noopener noreferrer">organized in subdirectories</a>,
and&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.3#export-multiple-islands-in-the-same-file" rel="noopener noreferrer">many of them can be exported from the same file</a>.</li>
<li>Fresh’s performance also increased, with the
new&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.4#faster-page-loads-with-ahead-of-time-compilation-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">ahead-of-time compilation step to cache client-side assets</a>&nbsp;(you
can enable this optimization step in Deno Deploy with GitHub Actions instead
of GitHub Automatic), snappier client-side navigation
with&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.5#client-side-navigation-with-partials" rel="noopener noreferrer">the introduction of Partials</a>,
as well as
an&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.6#improved-islands-bundling-strategy" rel="noopener noreferrer">improved islands bundling strategy</a>.</li>
<li>We’ve improved Fresh plugin system to be able
add&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.6#plugin-api-enhancements" rel="noopener noreferrer">islands</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.3#adding-routes-andor-middlewares-from-plugins" rel="noopener noreferrer">middlewares, and routes</a>.
One notable win
is&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.6#first-class-tailwind-css-plugin" rel="noopener noreferrer">moving off TwindCSS to TailwindCSS</a>,
which is actively maintained and is a performance boost. The Fresh community
also grew,
with&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/uki00a/awesome-fresh/" rel="noopener noreferrer">more projects either built in Fresh or libraries and plugins built for Fresh</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve got a lot planned for Fresh in 2024, such
as&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/denoland/fresh/issues/2108" rel="noopener noreferrer">view transitions, hot module reloading, and faster JSX transforms</a>.</p>
<h2 id="expanding-denos-cloud-business">Expanding Deno’s cloud business</h2><p>Though we’ve covered the big updates from our open source projects, the overall
Deno picture would be incomplete without mentioning developments on the
commercial side.</p>
<p>Though&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/subhosting" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Deno Subhosting</strong></a>&nbsp;has been around for a
while&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/netlify-edge-functions-on-deno-deploy" rel="noopener noreferrer">powering Netlify’s edge functions</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/deco-cx-subhosting-serve-their-clients-storefronts-fast" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deco.cx’s customer’s e-commerce stores</a>,
this year&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/subhosting" rel="noopener noreferrer">we made it self-service</a>&nbsp;so that anyone can deploy
and run their user’s code
programmatically&nbsp;<a href="https://apidocs.deno.com/#get-/projects/-projectId-/deployments" rel="noopener noreferrer">via our Subhosting API</a>&nbsp;for
free. It’s built to run third-party, untrusted code securely, as it’s
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/subhosting-security-run-untrusted-code" rel="noopener noreferrer">designed from the ground up for maximum tenant isolation</a>.
(Not sure what to use Deno Subhosting API for? Check out
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/deno-in-2023#fresh-easier-and-faster-is-gaining-momentum-%EF%B8%8F" rel="noopener noreferrer">this tutorial on how to build your own cloud IDE</a>.)</p>
<p>We’re made strides towards our vision of radically simplifying web development
with the launch of cloud primitives: <strong><a href="https://deno.com/kv" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno KV</a>, <a href="https://deno.com/blog/queues" rel="noopener noreferrer">Queues</a>,
and <a href="https://deno.com/blog/cron" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cron</a></strong>. They’re built right into the runtime so you can get
setup without juggling API keys or futzing with config:</p>
<div><pre><span>const</span> kv <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>Deno</span><span>.</span><span>openKv</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div><p>These cloud primitives seamlessly become globally distributed services when you
use Deno Deploy, optimizing your servers and applications for performance.</p>
<p>We’ve also broadened access to Deno KV by turning it
into&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/denoland/denokv" rel="noopener noreferrer">its own open sourced binary</a>, added
support&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.deno.com/kv/manual/on_deploy#connect-to-managed-databases-from-outside-of-deno-deploy" rel="noopener noreferrer">to remotely connect to any Deno KV instance</a>,
made it accessible in Node/npm
via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deno/kv" rel="noopener noreferrer">our official Deno KV npm module</a>,
as well as
adding&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.deno.com/kv/manual/backup" rel="noopener noreferrer">support for continuous replication with point-in-time recovery to S3 and GCS</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve got some big plans to simplify cloud development even further with more
features and new primitives, so stay tuned.</p>
<h2 id="deno-2-">Deno 2 👀</h2><p>We’re preparing for Deno 2, which will offer improved compatibility with Node
and npm, by
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/advanced/migrate_deprecations" rel="noopener noreferrer">providing a migration guide</a>
to ensure a smooth transition. Alongside an improved runtime, we also have some
exciting announcements around managing and optimizing dependencies for your
projects. Stay tuned in the coming weeks for a more detailed roadmap of what’s
to come. If you want a sneak peak - <a href="https://jsr.io/waitlist" rel="noopener noreferrer">look here</a>.</p>

                <p>G’day Rubyists. I’m currently working with a client on implementing a custom AI solution using an open source AI model. The reason for this is the client has very sensitive customer information and we don’t want to pass this across to OpenAI or other proprietary models, in order to maintain a very high level of security.</p>

<p>The solution has been to download and run an open source AI model in an AWS virtual machine, keeping the model completely under our control, with the Rails application making API calls to the AI in a safe environment.</p>

<p>I wanted to share with you how to download an open source AI model locally, get it running and run Ruby scripts against it.</p>

<h3 id="why-go-custom">Why Go Custom?</h3>
<p>The reason behind this project is straightforward: data security. When dealing with sensitive client information, the safest route is often to keep things in-house. This approach led us to explore custom AI models, which offer a higher degree of control and privacy.</p>

<h3 id="open-source-models">Open source models</h3>
<p>Over the last 6 months we have started to see a plethora of open source models hitting the market. While not as powerful as GPT-4, many of these models are showing performance that exceeds GPT-3.5 and they are only going to get better as time goes on.</p>

<p>There are a few other successful AI models such as Mistral, Mixtral and Lama. The right model to use depends on your processing power and what you are trying to achieve.</p>

<p>As we are going to be running this model locally, probably the best option is Mistral. It is about 4GB in size and outperforms GPT-3.5 on most metrics. For its size Mistral is the best model in my opinion.</p>

<p>Mixtral, out performs Mistral, but it is a huge model and requires at least 48GB of RAM to run.</p>

<h3 id="parameters">Parameters</h3>
<p>When talking about Large Language Models they are generally referred to by their parameter size, and a brief description of this is useful.</p>

<p>The Mistral model, which we will be running locally, is a 7 billion parameter model. Mixtral is a 70 billion parameter model.</p>

<p>It works this way, all of these LLMs are neural networks. A neural network is a collection of neurons, and each neuron connects to all of the other neurons in the proceeding layers.</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hynqxvid6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1706679063/media/Image_1.jpg" alt=" Running Open-Source AI Models">
</p>

<p>Each connection has a weight, which is usually a percentage. Each neuron also has a bias which modifies the data as it passes through that node.</p>

<p>The whole purpose of a neural network is to “learn” a very advanced algorithm which is effectively a pattern matching algorithm. In the case of LLMs, by being trained of huge amounts of text, it learns the ability to predict text patterns and so can generate meaningful responses to our prompts.</p>

<p>In simple terms the parameters are the number of weights and biases in the model. This tends to give us an idea of how many neurons are in the neural network. For a 7 billion parameter model there will be something on the order of 100 layers, with thousands of neurons per layer.</p>

<p>To put in context GPT-3.5 has about 175 billion parameters. It’s actually quite amazing that Mistral with 7 billion parameters can outperform GPT-3.5 in many metrics.</p>

<h3 id="software-to-run-models-locally">Software to run models locally</h3>
<p>In order to run our open source models locally it is necessary to download software to do this. While there are several options on the market, the simplest I found, and the one which will run on an Intel Mac, is <a href="https://ollama.ai/">Ollama</a>.</p>

<p>Right now Ollama runs on Mac and Linux, with Windows coming in the future. Though you can use WSL on Windows to run a Linux shell.</p>

<p>Ollama allows you to download and run these open source models. It also opens up the model on a local port giving you the ability to make API calls via your Ruby code. And this is where it gets fun as a Ruby developer. You can write Ruby apps that integrate with your own local models.</p>

<p>You can also watch this setup process on my YouTube video.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ZlkH4i_BnM?si=DU3-1K6oVFZoekME" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h3 id="setting-up-ollama">Setting Up Ollama</h3>
<p>Installation of Ollama is straightforward on Mac and Linux systems. Just download the software and it will install the package. Ollama is primarily command-line based, making it easy to install and run models. Just follow the steps and you will be set up in about 5 minutes.</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hynqxvid6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1706680650/media/Image_2.jpg" alt="Running Open-Source AI Models">
</p>

<h3 id="installing-your-first-model">Installing your first model</h3>

<p>Once you have Ollama set up and running, you should see the Ollama icon in your taskbar. This means it’s running in the background and will run your models.</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hynqxvid6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1706681152/media/Image_3.jpg" alt="Running Open-Source AI Models">
</p>
<p>The next step is to download the model.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open your terminal</li>
  <li>Run the following command:</li>
</ul>

<p><code>ollama run mistral</code></p>

<p>The first time this will download Mistral, which will take some time as it is about 4GB in size.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Once it has finished downloading it will open the Ollama prompt and you can start communicating with Mistral.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hynqxvid6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1706681411/media/Image_4.jpg" alt=" Running Open-Source AI Models">
</p>

<p>Next time you run <code>ollama run mistral</code> it will just run the model.</p>

<h3 id="customising-models">Customising Models</h3>
<p>With Ollama you can create customizations to the base model. This is a little like creating custom GPTs in OpenAI.</p>

<p>Full details are provided in the Ollama <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The steps to create a custom model are fairly simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a <code>Modelfile</code></li>
  <li>Add the following text to the Modelfile:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>
FROM mistral

# Set the temperature set the randomness or creativity of the response
PARAMETER temperature 0.3

# Set the system message
SYSTEM ”””
	You are an excerpt Ruby developer. You will be asked questions about the Ruby 
	Programming language. You will provide an explanation along with code examples.
	”””
</code></pre>

<p>The system message is what primes the AI model to respond in a given way.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create the new model. Run the following command in the terminal:</li>
</ul>

<p><code>ollama create &lt;model-name&gt; -f ‘./Modelfile’</code></p>

<p>In my case, I am calling the model Ruby.</p>

<p><code>ollama create ruby -f ‘./Modelfile’</code></p>

<p>This will create the new model.</p>

<ul>
  <li>List your models with the following command:</li>
</ul>

<p><code>ollama list</code></p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hynqxvid6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1706681774/media/Image_5.jpg" alt=" Running Open-Source AI Models">
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Now you can run the custom model</li>
</ul>

<p><code>ollama run ruby</code></p>

<h3 id="integrating-with-ruby">Integrating with Ruby</h3>
<p>Although there’s no dedicated gem for Ollama yet, Ruby developers can interact with the model using basic HTTP request methods. Ollama runs in the background, and it opens up the model via port <code>11434</code>, so you can access it on `http://localhost:11434’.
The Ollama <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md">API documentation</a> provides the different endpoints for the basic commands such as chat and creating embeddings.</p>

<p>For us we want to work with the <code>/api/chat</code> endpoint to send a prompt to the AI model.</p>

<p>Here is some basic Ruby code for interacting with the model.</p>

<pre><code>
require 'net/http'
require 'uri'
require 'json'


uri = URI('http://localhost:11434/api/chat')


request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri)
request.content_type = 'application/json'
request.body = JSON.dump({
 model: 'ruby',
 messages: [
   {
     role: 'user',
     content: 'How can I covert a PDF into text?',
   }
 ],
 stream: false
})


response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.hostname, uri.port) do |http|
 http.read_timeout = 120
 http.request(request)
end


puts response.body
</code></pre>

<p>The Ruby code does the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The code starts by requiring three libraries: ‘net/http’, ‘uri’, and ‘json’. These libraries are used for making HTTP requests, parsing URIs, and handling JSON data respectively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A URI object is created with the address of the API endpoint (‘http://localhost:11434/api/chat’).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new HTTP POST request is created using the Net::HTTP::Post.new method with the URI as the argument.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The content type of the request is set to ‘application/json’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The body of the request is set to a JSON string that represents a hash. This hash contains three keys: ‘model’, ‘messages’, and ‘stream’. The ‘model’ key is set to ‘ruby’ which is our model, the ‘messages’ key is set to an array containing a single hash representing a user message, and the ‘stream’ key is set to false.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The messages hash follows a model for intersecting with AI models. It takes a role and the content. The roles can be system, user and assistance. System is the priming message for how the model should respond. We already set that in the Modelfile. The user message is our standard prompt, and the model will respond with the assistant message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The HTTP request is sent using the Net::HTTP.start method. This method opens a network connection to the specified hostname and port, and then sends the request. The read timeout for the connection is set to 120 seconds given that I am running on a 2019 Intel Mac, the responds can be a little slow. This isn’t an issue running on the appropriate AWS servers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The response from the server is stored in the ‘response’ variable.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="practical-use-cases">Practical Use Cases</h3>
<p>The real value of running local AI models comes into play for companies dealing with sensitive data. These models are really good at processing unstructured data, like emails or documents, and extracting valuable, structured information.</p>

<p>For one use case I am training the model on all of the customer information in a CRM. This allows users to ask questions about the customer without needing to go through sometimes hundreds of notes.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Where security is not an issue I am more likely to work directly with OpenAI. But for companies that need private models, then Open Source is definitely the way to go.</p>

<p>If I get around to it, one of these days I’ll write a Ruby wrapper around the Ollama APIs to make it a little easier to interact with. If you would like to work on that project, then definitely reach out.</p>

<p>Have fun working with open source models.</p>

            <p><span>This incident was the result of an infrastructure change that was made to our load balancers to prepare us for IPv6 enablement of GitHub.com. This change was deployed to a subset of our global edge sites.<p>The change had the unintended consequence of causing IPv4 addresses to start being passed as an IPv4-mapped IPv6-compatible address to our IP Allow List functionality.</p><p>For example 10.1.2.3 became ::ffff:10.1.2.3. While our IP Allow List functionality was developed with IPv6 in mind, it wasn't developed to handle these mapped addresses, and hence started blocking requests as it deemed these to be not in the defined list of allowed addresses. Request error rates peaked at 0.23% of all requests.</p><p>We have so far identified three remediation items here:</p><p>- Update the IP Allow List functionality to handle IPv4-mapped addresses.<br>- Audit the rest of our stack to confirm there are no further places this IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses flaw exists.<br>- Improve our testing and monitoring processes to better catch these issues in the future.</p></span>
