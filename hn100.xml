Within this series, it has unveiled two groundbreaking versions: Falcon 2 11B, a more efficient and accessible LLM trained on 5.5 trillion tokens with 11 billion parameters, and Falcon 2 11B VLM, distinguished by its vision-to-language model (VLM) capabilities, which enable seamless conversion of visual inputs into textual outputs. While both models are multilingual, notably, Falcon 2 11B VLM stands out as TII's first multimodal model – and the only one currently in the top tier market that has this image-to-text conversion capability, marking a significant advancement in AI innovation.</p><p>Tested against several prominent AI models in its class among pre-trained models, Falcon 2 11B surpasses the performance of Meta’s newly launched Llama 3 with 8 billion parameters(8B), and performs on par with Google’s Gemma 7B at first place (Falcon 2 11B: 64.28 vs Gemma 7B: 64.29), as independently verified by Hugging Face, a US-based platform hosting an objective evaluation tool and global leaderboard for open LLMs. More importantly, Falcon 2 11B and 11B VLM are both open-source, empowering developers worldwide with unrestricted access. In the near future, there are plans to broaden the Falcon 2 next-generation models, introducing a range of sizes. These models will be further enhanced with advanced machine learning capabilities like 'Mixture of Experts' (MoE), aimed at pushing their performance to even more sophisticated levels.</p><p>All of TII’s AI models released to date have consistently ranked in the top tier globally, as the most powerful open-source LLMs. The new scaled-down and versatile Falcon 2 11B models are set to give TII greater market adoption in the ever-evolving world of generative AI.</p><p>Falcon 2 11B models, equipped with multilingual capabilities, seamlessly tackle tasks in English, French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, and various other languages, enriching their versatility and magnifying their effectiveness across diverse scenarios. Falcon 2 11B VLM, a 2 vision-to-language model, has the capability to identify and interpret images and visuals from the environment, providing a wide range of applications across industries such as healthcare, finance, e-commerce, education, and legal sectors. These applications range from document management, digital archiving, and context indexing to supporting individuals with visual impairments. Furthermore, these models can run efficiently on just one graphics processing unit (GPU), making them highly scalable, and easy to deploy and integrate into lighter infrastructures like laptops and other devices.</p><p><strong>H.E. Faisal Al Bannai</strong>, Secretary General of ATRC and Strategic Research and Advanced Technology Affairs Advisor to the UAE President, said: "With the release of Falcon 2 11B, we've introduced the first model in the Falcon 2 series. While Falcon 2 11B has demonstrated outstanding performance, we reaffirm our commitment to the open-source movement with it, and to the Falcon Foundation. With other multimodal models soon coming to the market in various sizes, our aim is to ensure that developers and entities that value their privacy, have access to one of the best AI models to enable their AI journey."</p><p>Speaking on the model, <strong>Dr. Hakim Hacid</strong>, Executive Director and Acting Chief Researcher of the AI Cross-Center Unit at TII, said: “AI is continually evolving, and developers are recognizing the myriad benefits of smaller, more efficient models. In addition to reducing computing power requirements and meeting sustainability criteria, these models offer enhanced flexibility, seamlessly integrating into edge AI infrastructure, the next emerging megatrend. Furthermore, the vision-to-language capabilities of Falcon 2 open new horizons for accessibility in AI, empowering users with transformative image to text interactions.”</p><p>The versatility of Falcon 2 11B has also led TII to consider working on more exciting GenAI innovations. Among these, will be the adoption of a new type of machine learning capability known as the aforementioned ‘Mixture of Experts’. This method involves amalgamating smaller networks with distinct specializations, ensuring that the most knowledgeable domains collaborate to deliver highly sophisticated and customized responses – almost like having a team of smart helpers who each know something different and work together to predict or make decisions when needed. This approach not only improves accuracy, but it also accelerates decision-making, paving the way for more intelligent and efficient AI systems</p><p>Falcon 2 11B is licenced under TII Falcon License 2.0, the permissive Apache 2.0-based software license which includes an acceptable use policy that promotes the responsible use of AI.

        <p>Recently, the USDA updated its plant hardiness map for the first time in 11<span>&nbsp;</span>years.</p>
<p>If you’re a gardener — and everybody can be a gardener, even on a balcony or a stoop — this is a big<span>&nbsp;</span>deal!</p>
<p>The updated map opens up new possibilities for home gardeners, but there are limits. Let’s explore how the map has changed and what this means for your<span>&nbsp;</span>garden.</p>

<div id="intro-3" data-type="map" data-maplayer="2023_zones"> 
  <p>
    In 2023, <span data-item="yourPlaceShort"></span> is still rated as Zone <span data-item="newZone"></span>.

  <div><p>
    In 2023, the USDA reclassified <span data-item="yourPlaceShort"></span> as Zone <span data-item="newZone">8a</span>. 
</p><p>Now, the lowest winter temperature is <span data-item="tempRange-2023"></span> degrees Fahrenheit on<span>&nbsp;</span>average.</p>

  <p>
    That’s because the new average minimum temperature in <span data-item="yourPlaceShort"></span> is <span data-item="tempDiff"> 3.3 degrees Fahrenheit  warmer</span> than the previous average, from an earlier period.

      <summary>About this data</summary>
      <p>The 2012 USDA hardiness zones were calculated using the average lowest winter temperature for the observation period of 1976-2005. The new zones are calculated using the years 1991-2020. These two observation windows overlap. Colors show the difference between the two 30-year averages for each place on the<span>&nbsp;</span>map.</p>

      <p>Most of the changes across the country are due to the warming<span>&nbsp;</span>climate.</p>
<p>Winters are warming at a faster pace than other seasons, according to Deke Arndt, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental<span>&nbsp;</span>Information.</p>
<p>At the same time, an increase in the amount and quality of data collected at weather stations across the country helped to improve the overall accuracy of temperature readings in recent<span>&nbsp;</span>years.</p>

<h3>What does your hardiness zone tell<span>&nbsp;</span>you?</h3>
<p>Some people might think their hardiness zone tells them which plants they can grow. In reality, it’s a little more<span>&nbsp;</span>complicated.</p>
<p>Your zone measurement is an average of the coldest yearly temperature in your area over the past 30<span>&nbsp;</span>years.</p>

    </div>
<section id="temperature-chart" data-type="chart">  
  
  


  <div id="chart-1"><p>Here are the coldest temperatures from each winter between 1991 and 2020 in <span data-item="chartPlaceShort"></span>. 
</p><p>Though these temperature estimates differ slightly from the data the USDA used to create the zone map, we’re using them to illustrate how zones are calculated.</p></div>

  <div id="chart-2"><p>The <span>average coldest night</span> over the past 30 years was about <span data-item="avg"></span>.</p></div>

  <div id="chart-3"> 
  <div><p>
    With this average temperature, <span data-item="chartPlace"></span> might be classified as Zone <span data-item="wrongZone"></span>.	
</p><p>However, the temperatures we’re showing here are based on estimates, and in this case they do not align with the more accurate, granular data that the USDA used. The USDA map classifies this area as <span data-item="newZone"></span>.</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    With this average coldest temperature, <span data-item="chartPlaceShort"></span> is classified as Zone <span data-item="chartNewZone"></span>.
  </p>
</div>

</section>
<div id="how-to" data-type="text">
        <p>This measurement, which predicts an area’s coldest temperatures, is only useful for plants that have to survive the<span>&nbsp;</span>winter.</p>
<p>They’re called <b>perennials:</b> You plant them once and they come back after each winter if they’re given the right environment to survive. Think things like trees, shrubs and woody<span>&nbsp;</span>plants.</p>


        

        <p>And for predicting winter plant survival, knowing an area’s hardiness zone is a big help to gardeners, says Todd Rounsaville, a horticulturist with the USDA who was involved with creating the new map. He explains that the hardiness zone “is really one of the best predictors of winter survival and plant survival in general in the<span>&nbsp;</span>landscape.”</p>
<p>He advises gardeners to use the map as one very important tool of many in their risk assessment<span>&nbsp;</span>toolbox.</p>
<p>“Because the USDA map has really become the industry standard for rating things, it’s pretty rare that you will not see a zone rating on a plant, either on the tag or on a website,” he<span>&nbsp;</span>says.</p>
<p>Knowing what your average coldest temperature is helps rightsize your expectations about what might grow in your area. Live in Chicago’s <span>Zone 6a</span>? You can be assured that no citrus plants will survive your winter. Instead, try an apple tree. The apple tree is that kid you grew up with who wore shorts all winter. It needs the cold temperatures to set<span>&nbsp;</span>fruit.</p>
<p>Live in Miami’s <span>Zone 11a</span>? No apples for you. Instead, grow dragon<span>&nbsp;</span>fruit!</p>
<p><img data-src="./assets/synced/illo/resized/plant-tag.png" width="1200" height="674" alt="" src="https://apps.npr.org/plant-hardiness-garden-map/assets/synced/illo/resized/plant-tag.png">
</p>
<h3>What does your hardiness zone <u>not</u> tell you?</h3>
<p>On its own, your hardiness zone can’t tell you exactly what to grow in your<span>&nbsp;</span>area.</p>
<p>For example, parts of these three areas — Juneau, Alaska; Boston, Mass.; and Santa Fe, N.M. — are all in USDA’s <span>Zone<span>&nbsp;</span>7a</span>.</p>


        

        <p>“We know intuitively that the same plants can’t grow in these places,” Rounsaville<span>&nbsp;</span>says.</p>
<p>While Juneau may have relatively temperate winters, it also is extremely wet, averaging over 80 inches of snow a year. Santa Fe, on the other hand, is extremely dry, with much hotter summer temperatures than Juneau. Boston has both temperate winters and summers. It gets a good amount of rain but not nearly enough to sustain Juneau’s rainforest plants. It gets plenty of heat but is colder and wetter in the winter, making it inhospitable for desert dwellers, like cactuses and other<span>&nbsp;</span>succulents.</p>
<p>But all three cities rarely get below zero degrees each winter, so they are classified as the same<span>&nbsp;</span>zone.</p>
<p>So when you hear that your zone has changed, here are some things to keep in<span>&nbsp;</span>mind:</p>
<h4><span><b>1</b> The hardiness map says nothing about your <u>extreme</u> lowest temperature</span></h4>
<p>Just because your average lowest winter temperature has changed, doesn’t mean the temperature will never dip below your hardiness<span>&nbsp;</span>zone.</p>

      </div><section id="temperature-chart-return" data-type="chart" data-center="[-90.244582,38.635699]">  
  
  


  <div id="return-1">
    <p>For example, the average coldest night of the year in <u>St. Louis, Mo.,</u> tends to be around 2º F, meaning that it’s in Zone <span>7a</span>. Because St. Louis has warmed, it moved up from its <span>previous zone rating</span> of <span>6b</span>.</p>

    

    

    
  </div>

  <div id="return-2">

      <p>But notice that this is an <b><u>average</u></b> of the coldest temperature St. Louis gets each<span>&nbsp;</span>winter.</p>
<p>In the past 30 years, the temperature dropped below <span>Zone 7a</span> in at least 11 different<span>&nbsp;</span>years.</p>

    </div>

  <div id="return-3">

      <p>In 2014, the temperature dipped <span><b>three</b> half zones</span> below St. Louis’ hardiness zone, to -10º F.<span>&nbsp;</span>Brrrr!</p>
<p>Many common&nbsp;plants that are hardy down to Zone <span>7</span>, like rosemary, canna lilies or agave, would suffer significant damage or death from those temperatures, especially during a long cold<span>&nbsp;</span>snap.</p>

    </div>

</section>
<div id="limits-of-hardiness" data-type="text">
        <h4><span><b>2</b> The hardiness map says nothing about the <u>frequency</u> of extreme cold<span>&nbsp;</span>weather</span></h4>
<p>Your poor plants have to stay outside all winter, so the duration and frequency of cold weather matters for plant<span>&nbsp;</span>survival.</p>
<p>“If you’re naked and you run through a freezer, it’s not going to kill you,” says Andrew Bunting, vice president of horticulture at the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. “If you run into the freezer and have to stay there for an extended period of time, it’s probably going to kill<span>&nbsp;</span>you.”</p>
<p><img data-src="./assets/synced/illo/resized/fig.png" width="1200" height="674" alt="" src="https://apps.npr.org/plant-hardiness-garden-map/assets/synced/illo/resized/fig.png">
</p>
<p>If extreme, out-of-zone weather occurs during a quick cold snap, steps can be taken to protect your plants with temporary blankets or other shelters. Pots can be brought<span>&nbsp;</span>inside.</p>
<p>But if the extreme lows persist, tender plants will struggle to survive. Your hardiness zone does not take any of this into<span>&nbsp;</span>account.</p>
<h4><span><b>3</b> The hardiness map can’t tell you if your plants will survive the<span>&nbsp;</span>summer</span></h4>
<p>Summer temperature extremes matter a great deal but are not reflected in the USDA hardiness<span>&nbsp;</span>map.</p>
<p>Let’s look again at <u>Juneau</u> and <u>Santa Fe,</u> much of which are in <span>Zone 7a</span>. Juneau’s all-time high temperature was 90º F in 1975. Summer days in Santa Fe routinely reach the 90s. Some shade- and cool-weather-loving plants like ferns and hostas will thrive in Juneau but struggle mightily in a place like Santa Fe. Likewise, a cactus accustomed to high temperatures would struggle to thrive in the cooler summer temperatures of Juneau, to say nothing of the overwhelming<span>&nbsp;</span>rainfall.</p>
<p>Because of this tricky problem, there have been attempts to create a corresponding map that helps gardeners know which plants might survive summer in their<span>&nbsp;</span>area.</p>
<p>In 1997, the American Horticultural Society released a heat zone map that measured the average number of times per year that the temperature of an area exceeds 86º<span>&nbsp;</span>F.</p>
<p><img data-src="./assets/synced/images/ahs-heat-map.jpg" alt="AHS Heat Zone Map (1997)" src="https://apps.npr.org/plant-hardiness-garden-map/assets/synced/images/ahs-heat-map.jpg">
<span>American Horticultural Society</span> 
</p>
<p>But this map didn’t become well known among gardeners. On a recent visit to a plant nursery outside Washington, D.C., nearly every plant tag had a USDA hardiness zone, but only one, out of the several dozen checked, had the AHS heat zone<span>&nbsp;</span>listed.</p>
<p>Above 86º F, plants from cooler climates rapidly become<span>&nbsp;</span>stressed.</p>
<p>Because of these complexities, more plant survival factors should be included in the 2023 map, says Tony Avent, who runs Juniper Level Botanic Garden and Plant Delights Nursery in Raleigh,<span>&nbsp;</span>N.C.</p>
<p>“If [these metrics] had been factored in, that would have given you a much more applicable map,” says Avent, who was a member of the committee that put together the 2012 version of the<span>&nbsp;</span>map.</p>
<p>“And that’s the part that’s a little<span>&nbsp;</span>disappointing.”</p>

</p>
<p>But including more plant survival factors in the USDA hardiness map runs the risk of creating an overly complicated map and muddying its intended use, Rounsaville<span>&nbsp;</span>says.</p>
<p>“In a perfect world, we could infinitely break down where plants will grow well, but that’s very hard to do and produce a map that is, you know, coherent but at a local resolution,” Rounsaville<span>&nbsp;</span>says.</p>
<p><img data-src="./assets/synced/illo/resized/shovel.png" width="”600”" height="”400”" alt="””" src="https://apps.npr.org/plant-hardiness-garden-map/assets/synced/illo/resized/shovel.png">
</p>
<p>Since the USDA plant hardiness zone can’t tell you everything about how a plant will fare in your garden, it’s a good idea to turn to local plant experts for guidance. Local nurseries and botanical gardens can be great resources for in-depth knowledge of the area and recent warming or cooling<span>&nbsp;</span>trends.</p>
<p>New plant varieties are constantly being bred with improvements such as increased hardiness, bloom count, bloom length or color<span>&nbsp;</span>combinations.</p>
<p>Some nursery owners like Avent enjoy experimenting with these plants.  He and his team grow many varieties of plants — both typical and unconventional — to figure out which plants they can bring to market in<span>&nbsp;</span>Raleigh.</p>
<p>“We live to kill plants,” Avent says. He estimates that they’ve killed over 50,000 plant varieties in his career. Every one they kill, they record in a<span>&nbsp;</span>database.</p>
<p><img data-src="./assets/synced/illo/resized/hose.png" width="”600”" height="”400”" alt="””" src="https://apps.npr.org/plant-hardiness-garden-map/assets/synced/illo/resized/hose.png">
</p>
<h3>If my zone changed, can I plant new things<span>&nbsp;</span>now?</h3>
<p>Maybe, and maybe you already did! It’s possible you or your neighbors may have already noticed some of these climatic changes and have been experimenting with plant varieties that were once unusual for your<span>&nbsp;</span>area.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the new USDA map is backward looking; it represents changes that have already taken place over the past 30<span>&nbsp;</span>years.</p>
<p>In the <span>7a</span>-<span>7b</span> Philadelphia suburbs, Bunting notes two perennials that he has noticed surviving Philadelphia winters in recent<span>&nbsp;</span>years.</p>
<p>“It used to be [that] if you had a camellia, it was in a little courtyard with lots of protection, maybe even wrapped [in protective cloth] for the winter.” But now, “It’s perfectly hardy. Same with figs. People used to wrap figs. You don’t have to do that<span>&nbsp;</span>anymore.”</p>
<p>Of course, your mileage may vary. As Bunting notes, <i>where</i> you plant a perennial in your yard — whether sheltered or in the open — matters. Some areas get southern exposure and lots of sun, others are behind a house, or under a tree. Every yard has many distinct microclimates, and learning how to harness these subtle differences in your yard can help you plant more ambitious varieties with more<span>&nbsp;</span>confidence.</p>
<p>“Gardeners know that if they’re near paved surfaces or brick and mortar structures, that there’s a lot of radiant heat that those absorb during the day,” Rounsaville says. “And they can really push hardiness zones through the winter to help with plant<span>&nbsp;</span>survival.”</p>

    <p>Aside from local nurseries and botanic gardens, cooperative extension services can be a great place to find local gardening advice.

        <p>One thing I’ve noticed in my horticulture career is that <span>“global weirding”</span> — the continental climate variability we have here — does quite a bit to negate the USDA zone changes.

        <p>Since our climate is more moderate in climate extremes (highs and lows) vs. say the Midwest or East Coast, these extremes have not necessarily increased significantly other than in duration and period of occurrence.

A greater impact may be noticed as you go north, where the area may experience more insect and disease pressure due to mild winters, and a shift in vegetable crops that can be grown. For example, <span>okra</span> is not common in Michigan but may be easily grown with warmer temperatures. This change may also have more impact on <span>fruiting trees such as apples</span> with a minimum chilling hours requirement that will not be met if temperatures continue to stay warmer in the winters.</p></div>

<p>
<a name="its-an-age-of-marvels" href="https://blog.plover.com/tech/its-an-age-of-marvels.html">It's an age of marvels</a>
<br>
</p><p>As I walk around Philadelphia I often converse with Benjamin Franklin,
to see what he thinks about how things have changed since 1790.
Sometimes he's astounded, other times less so. The things that
astound Franklin aren't always what you might think at first.
Electric streetlamps are a superb invention, and while I think
Franklin would be very pleased to see them, I don't think he would be
surprised.  Better street lighting was something everyone wanted in
Franklin's time, and
<a href="https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page60.htm">this was something very much on Franklin's mind</a>.
It was certainly clear that electricity could be turned into light.
Franklin could have and might have thought up the basic
mechanism of an incandescent bulb himself, although he wouldn't have
been able to make one.</p>

<p>The Internet?  Well, again yes, but no.  The complicated engineering
details are complicated engineering, but again the basic idea is
easily within the reach of the 18th century and is not all that
astounding.  They hadn't figured out Oersted's law yet, which was
crucial, but they certainly knew that you could do something at one
end of a long wire and it would have an effect at the other end, and
had an idea that that might be a way to send messages from one place
to another.  Wikipedia says that as early as 1753 people were thinking
that an electric signal could deflect a ping-pong ball at the
receiving end.  It might have worked!  If you look into the history of
transatlantic telegraph cables you will learn that the earliest
methods were almost as clunky.</p>

<p>Wikipedia itself is more impressive.  The universal encyclopedia has
long been a dream, and now we have one.  It's not always reliable,
but you know what?  Not all of <em>anything</em> is reliable.</p>

<p>An obvious winner, something sure to blow Franklin's mind is “yeah,
we've sent people to the Moon to see what it was like, they left
scientific instruments there and then they came back with rocks and
stuff.”  But that's no everyday thing, it blew everyone's mind when it
happened and it still does.  Some things I tell Franklin make him
goggle and say “We did <em>what</em>?” and I shrug modestly and say yeah,
it's pretty impressive, isn't it.  The Moon thing makes me goggle
right
back. <a href="https://store.theonion.com/products/man-walks-on-moon-front-page-poster-from-the-onions-our-dumb-century"><em>The Onion</em> nailed it</a>.</p>

<p>The really interesting stuff is the <em>everyday</em> stuff that makes
Franklin goggle.  CAT scans, for example.  Ordinary endoscopy will
interest and perhaps impress Franklin, but it won't boggle his mind.
(“Yeah, the doctor sticks a tube up your butt with an electric light
so they can see if your bowel is healthy.”  Franklin nods right
along.)  X-rays are more impressive.  (I wrote a while back about
<a href="https://blog.plover.com/tech/dental-x-rays.html">how long it took dentists to start adopting X-ray technology</a>:
about two weeks.)  But CAT scans are mind-boggling.  Oh yeah, we send
invisible rays at you from all directions, and measure how much each
one was attenuated from passing through your body, and then infer from
that exactly what must be inside and how it is all arranged.  We do
<em>what</em>?  And that's without getting into any of the details of whether
this is done by positron emission or nuclear magnetic resonance
(whatever those are, I have no idea) or something else equally
incomprehensible.  Apparently there really is something to this
quantum physics nonsense.</p>

<p>So far though the most Franklin-astounding thing I've found has been GPS.  The
explanation starts with “well, first we put 32 artificial satellites
in orbit around the Earth…”, which is already astounding, and can
derail the conversation all by itself.  But it just
goes on from there getting more and more astounding:</p>

<p>“…and each one has a  clock on board, accurate to within 40 nanoseconds…”</p>

<p>“…and can communicate the exact time wirelessly to the entire half of
the Earth that it can see…”</p>

<p>“… and because the GPS device <em>also</em> has a perfect clock, it can
compute how far it is from the satellite by comparing the two times
and multiplying by the speed of light…”</p>

<p>“… and because the satellite also tells the GPS device exactly where
it is, the device can determine that it lies on the surface of a sphere
with the satellite at the center, so with messages from three or four
satellites the device can compute its exact location, up to the error
in the clocks and other measurements…”</p>

<p>“…and it fits in my pocket.”</p>

<p>And that's not even getting into the hair-raising complications
introduced by general relativity.  “It's a bit fiddly because time
isn't passing at the same rate for the device as it is for the
satellites, but we were able to work it out.”  What.  The.  Fuck.</p>

<p>Of course not all marvels are good ones.  I sometimes explain to
Franklin that we have gotten so good at fishing&nbsp;— <em>too</em> good&nbsp;— that we
are in real danger of fishing out the oceans.  A marvel,
nevertheless.</p>

<p>A past what-the-fuck was that we know exactly how many cells
there are (959) in a particular little worm, <em>C. elegans</em>, and
<a href="https://www.wormatlas.org/celllineages.html">how each of those cells arises from the division of previous cells</a>,
as the grows from a fertilized egg, and we know what each cell does
and how they are connected, and we know that 302 of those cells are
nerve cells, and how the nerve cells are connected together.  (There
are 6,720 connections.)  The big science news on Friday was that for
the first time
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add9330">we have done this for an insect brain</a>.
It was the <em>drosophila</em> larva, and it has 3016 neurons and 548,000
synapses.</p>

<p>Today I was reading somewhere about how most meteorites are
asteroidal, but some are from the Moon and a few are from Mars.  I
wondered “how do we know that they are from Mars?” but then I couldn't
understand
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_meteorite">the explanation</a>.
Someday maybe.</p>

<p>And by the way, there are only 277 known Martian meteorites.  So
today's what-the-fuck is: “Yeah, we looked at all the rocks we could
find all over the Earth and we noticed a couple hundred we found lying
around various places looked funny and we figured out they must have
come from Mars.  And when.  And how long they were on Mars before
that.”</p>

<p>Obviously, It's amazing that we know enough about Mars to
be able to say that these rocks are like the ones on Mars. (“Yeah, we
sent some devices there to look around and send back messages about
what it was like.”)  But to me, the deeper and more amazing thing is,
from looking at billions of rocks, we have learned <em>so</em> much about what
rocks are like that we can pick out, from these billions, a couple of
hundred that came to the Earth not merely from elsewhere but
<em>specifically</em> from Mars.</p>

<p>What. The. Fuck.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>One of the wisest and most important pieces of advice I received as a startup founder was this: “The worst outcome is a mediocre success”.</p><p>Now, this is not a simplistic exhortation to go big or go home, hit a home run or strike out, be blindly ambitious, any of those things. It's subtler than that. Let me explain.</p><p>Startups are defined by uncertainty. As a founder, you have to discover almost everything about your business: What is the product? Who are your customers? How will you reach them? How much will they pay? Who are your competitors? How is the industry evolving? The list goes on.</p><p>One common way to answer these questions is, essentially, the scientific method, applied to tech startups. Frame a hypothesis; run an experiment to test the hypothesis; confirm or disprove the hypothesis; learn and iterate and learn and iterate.</p><p>For example, your hypothesis could be that ‘Cold-calling customers will lead to sales’. So you hire a couple of sales reps and tell them to cold-call 100 customers. If you get 30 new sales out of that (a terrific hit rate) — great, the hypothesis is true! You can hire more sales reps and double down on this tactic. And if you get 0 new sales — that’s also great, the hypothesis is false! You can move on to other acquisition tactics like FB ads or SEO or events or whatever. Either way, your experiment worked in confirming or disproving the hypothesis.</p><p><span>The </span><em>worst</em><span> outcome, the very worst outcome, is to get a small but non-zero number of sales — say 1 or 2. Because now you're in a bind. Do you double down or pull the plug? Does cold-calling work or not? Could it be that the method works, but the sales reps aren’t hustling enough, or they’re not following the right script, or they’re not calling the right people? Or maybe the method is flawed and your reps just got lucky? You just don't know!</span></p><p>That’s the danger of the mediocre success. The point of startup experimentation isn't the success itself; it’s the learning that comes with clear-cut success or failure. You don't really care about the sales revenue generated by your first two reps; you care about whether this is a strategy you can scale to dozens and then hundreds of reps, or whether you need to use a completely different strategy. It’s all about the learning. And mediocre successes don’t give you any learning.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff391cd33-db65-4f91-be4a-49311c477d7b_1513x811.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff391cd33-db65-4f91-be4a-49311c477d7b_1513x811.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff391cd33-db65-4f91-be4a-49311c477d7b_1513x811.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff391cd33-db65-4f91-be4a-49311c477d7b_1513x811.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff391cd33-db65-4f91-be4a-49311c477d7b_1513x811.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff391cd33-db65-4f91-be4a-49311c477d7b_1513x811.jpeg" width="460" height="246.42857142857142" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f391cd33-db65-4f91-be4a-49311c477d7b_1513x811.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:780,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:460,&quot;bytes&quot;:151282,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff391cd33-db65-4f91-be4a-49311c477d7b_1513x811.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff391cd33-db65-4f91-be4a-49311c477d7b_1513x811.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff391cd33-db65-4f91-be4a-49311c477d7b_1513x811.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff391cd33-db65-4f91-be4a-49311c477d7b_1513x811.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Unfortunately, there’s a natural human tendency to hedge our bets — to make design choices in our experiments such that a mediocre success is the most likely outcome. There’s also a tendency to only do experiments that you know in advance will work — but such experiments are not useful: the delta in information is close to zero. For example, and continuing the sales experiment: as a founder, you could do the calls yourself; reach out only to the very best, most qualified prospects; create custom collateral; offer sweetheart pricing. All those actions will increase the chances of closing any one deal, and as a result they’re very tempting, but do they tell you if cold-calling is a viable sales strategy at scale? Nope.</p><p>Making it worse is that we’re all heavily socialized to aim for mediocre success. Schools, universities, large organizations — they don’t want big swings and big misses; they want safety and consistency. A steady 7 is better than 10s interspersed with 0s.

	<div>
		<p>Apple did what needed to be done to get that unfortunate iPad ad out of the news; you know, the one that somehow found the crushing of musical instruments and bottles of paint to be inspirational:</p>

<p>The ad was released as a part of <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/apples-ipad-event-the-peaceful-ipad-disney-earnings/">the company’s iPad event</a>, and was originally scheduled to run on TV; Tor Myhren, Apple’s vice-president of marketing communications, <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/apple-apologizes-ipad-pro-crushed-ad-it-missed-mark/2559321">told AdAge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it’s incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world…Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we’re sorry.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The apology comes across as heartfelt — accentuated by the fact that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/09/apple-crush-apology">an Apple executive put his name to it</a> — but I disagree with Myhren: the reason why people reacted so strongly to the ad is that it couldn’t have hit the mark more squarely.</p>
<h3>Aggregation Theory</h3>
<p>The Internet, birthed as it was in the idealism of California tech in the latter parts of the 20th century, was expected to be a force for decentralization; one of the central conceits of this blog has been to explain why reality has been so different. From 2015’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/">Aggregation Theory</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The fundamental disruption of the Internet has been to turn this dynamic on its head. First, the Internet has made distribution (of digital goods) free, neutralizing the advantage that pre-Internet distributors leveraged to integrate with suppliers. Secondly, the Internet has made transaction costs zero, making it viable for a distributor to integrate forward with end users/consumers at scale.</p>
<p>  <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-12.47.09-PM.png?resize=640%2C275&amp;ssl=1" alt="Aggregation Theory" width="640" height="275" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-12.47.09-PM.png?w=1816&amp;ssl=1 1816w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-12.47.09-PM.png?resize=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-12.47.09-PM.png?resize=768%2C330&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-12.47.09-PM.png?resize=1024%2C440&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-12.47.09-PM.png?resize=1200%2C515&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-12.47.09-PM.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>  This has fundamentally changed the plane of competition: no longer do distributors compete based upon exclusive supplier relationships, with consumers/users an afterthought. Instead, suppliers can be commoditized leaving consumers/users as a first order priority. By extension, this means that the most important factor determining success is the user experience: the best distributors/aggregators/market-makers win by providing the best experience, which earns them the most consumers/users, which attracts the most suppliers, which enhances the user experience in a virtuous cycle.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, the analog world was defined by scarcity, which meant distribution of scarce goods was the locus of power; the digital world is defined by abundance, which means discovery of what you actually want to see is the locus of power. The result is that consumers have access to anything, which is to say that nothing is special; everything has been flattened.</p>
<ul>
<li>Google broke down every publication in the world into individual pages; search results didn’t deliver you to the front page of a newspaper or magazine, but rather dropped you onto individual articles.</li>
<li>Facebook promoted user-generated content to the same level of the hierarchy as articles from professional publications; your feed might have a picture of your niece followed by a link to a deeply-reported investigative report followed by a meme.</li>
<li>Amazon created the “Everything Store” with practically every item on earth and the capability to deliver it to your doorstep; instead of runnings errands you could simply check-out</li>
<li>Netflix transformed “What’s on?” to “What do you want to watch?”. Everything from high-brow movies to budget flicks to prestige TV to reality TV was on equal footing, ready to be streamed whenever and wherever you wanted.</li>
<li>Sites like Expedia and Booking changed travel from an adventure mediated by a travel agent or long-standing brands to search results organized by price and amenities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, this was only v1; it turns out that the flattening can go even further:</p>
<ul>
<li>LLMs are breaking down all written text ever into massive models that don’t even bother with pages: they simply give you the answer.</li>
<li>TikTok disabused Meta of the notion that your relationships were a useful constraint on the content you wanted to see; now all short-form video apps surface content from across the entire network based on their understanding of what you individually are interested in.</li>
<li>Amazon is transforming into a logistics powerhouse befitting the fact that Amazon.com is increasingly dominated by 3rd-party merchant sales, and extending that capability throughout the economy.</li>
<li>All of Hollywood, convinced that content was what mattered, jointly killed the linear TV model to ensure that all professionally-produced content was available on-demand, even as the YouTube became the biggest streamer of all with user-generated content that is delivered through the exact same distribution channel (apps on a smart device) as the biggest blockbusters.</li>
<li>Services like Uber and Airbnb commoditized transportation and lodging to the individual driver or homeowner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple is absent from this list, although the App Store has had an Aggregator effect on developers; the reason the company belongs, though, and why they were the only company that could make an ad that so perfectly captures this great flattening, is because they created the device on which all of these services operate. The prerequisite to the commoditization of everything is access to anything, thanks to the smartphone. “There’s an app for that” indeed:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/szrsfeyLzyg?si=wot79Q9zFOfjC-Vw&amp;controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is what I mean when I say that Apple’s iPad ad hit the mark: the reason why I think the ad resonated so deeply is that it captured something deep in the gestalt that actually has very little to do with trumpets or guitars or bottles of paint; rather, thanks to the Internet — particularly the smartphone-denominated Internet — everything is an app.</p>
<h3>The Bicycle for the Mind</h3>
<p>The more tangible way to see in which that iPad ad hit the mark it to play it in reverse:</p>

<p>This is without question the message that Apple was going for: this one device, thin as can be, contains musical instruments, an artist’s studio, an arcade machine, and more. It brings relationships without borders to life, complete with cute emoji. And it’s not wrong!</p>
<p>Indeed, it harkens back to one of Steve Jobs’ last keynotes, when he introduced the iPad 2. My favorite moment in that keynote — one of my favorite Steve Jobs’ keynote moments ever, in fact — was the introduction of GarageBand. You can <a href="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/pyENUudf/garageband-introduction.mp4">watch the entire introduction and demo</a>, but the part that stands out in my memory is Jobs — clearly sick, in retrospect — moved by what the company had just produced:</p>

<blockquote><p>
  I’m blown away with this stuff. Playing your own instruments, or using the smart instruments, anyone can make music now, in something that’s this thick and weighs 1.3 pounds. It’s unbelievable. GarageBand for iPad. Great set of features — again, this is no toy. This is something you can really use for real work. This is something that, I cannot tell you, how many hours teenagers are going to spend making music with this, and teaching themselves about music with this.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Jobs wasn’t wrong: <a href="https://medium.com/@certifiedmish/artists-who-made-global-hits-with-garageband-32314c0861e1">global hits have originated on GarageBand</a>, and undoubtedly many more hours of (mostly terrible, if my personal experience is any indication) amateur experimentation. Why I think this demo was so personally meaningful for Jobs, though, is that not only was GarageBand about music, one of his deepest passions, but it was also a manifestation of his life’s work: creating a bicycle for the mind.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  I remember reading an Article when I was about 12 years old, I think it might have been in <em>Scientific American</em>, where they measured the efficiency of locomotion for all these species on planet earth. How many kilocalories did they expend to get from point A to point B, and the condor won: it came in at the top of the list, surpassed everything else. And humans came in about a third of the way down the list, which was not such a great showing for the crown of creation.</p>
<p>  But somebody there had the imagination to test the efficiency of a human riding a bicycle. Human riding a bicycle blew away the condor, all the way off the top of the list. And it made a really big impression on me that we humans are tool builders, and that we can fashion tools that amplify these inherent abilities that we have to spectacular magnitudes, and so for me a computer has always been a bicycle of the mind, something that takes us far beyond our inherent abilities.</p>
<p>  I think we’re just at the early stages of this tool, very early stages, and we’ve come only a very short distance, and it’s still in its formation, but already we’ve seen enormous changes, but I think that’s nothing compared to what’s coming in the next 100 years.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In Jobs view of the world, teenagers the world over are potential musicians, who might not be able to afford a piano or guitar or trumpet; if, though, they can get an iPad — now even thinner and lighter! — they can have access to everything they need. In this view “There’s an app for that” is profoundly empowering.</p>
<h3>After the Flattening</h3>
<p>The duality of Apple’s ad speaks to the reality of technology: its impact is structural, and amoral. When I first started Stratechery I wrote a piece called <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/friction/">Friction</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If there is a single phrase that describes the effect of the Internet, it is the elimination of friction. With the loss of friction, there is necessarily the loss of everything built on friction, including value, privacy, and livelihoods. And that’s only three examples! The Internet is pulling out the foundations of nearly every institution and social more that our society is built upon.</p>
<p>  Count me with those who believe the Internet is on par with the industrial revolution, the full impact of which stretched over centuries. And it wasn’t all good. Like today, the industrial revolution included a period of time that saw many lose their jobs and a massive surge in inequality. It also lifted millions of others out of sustenance farming. Then again, it also propagated slavery, particularly in North America. The industrial revolution led to new monetary systems, and it created robber barons. Modern democracies sprouted from the industrial revolution, and so did fascism and communism. The quality of life of millions and millions was unimaginably improved, and millions and millions died in two unimaginably terrible wars.</p>
<p>  Change is guaranteed, but the type of change is not; never is that more true than today. See, friction makes everything harder, both the good we can do, but also the unimaginably terrible. In our zeal to reduce friction and our eagerness to celebrate the good, we ought not lose sight of the potential bad.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Today that exhortation might run in the opposite direction: in our angst about the removal of specialness and our eagerness to criticize the bad, we ought not lose sight of the potential good.</p>
<p>Start with this site that you are reading: yes, the Internet commoditized content that was previously granted value by virtue of being bundled with a light manufacturing business (i.e. printing presses and delivery trucks), but it also created the opportunity for entirely new kinds of content predicated on reaching niche audiences that are only sustainable when the entire world is your market.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to every other form of content, from music to video to books to art; the extent to which being “special” meant being scarce is the extent to which the existence of “special” meant a constriction of opportunity. Moreover, that opportunity is not a function of privilege but rather consumer demand: the old powers may decry that their content is competing with everyone on the Internet, but they are only losing to the extent that consumers actually prefer to read or watch or listen to something else. Is this supposed to be a bad thing?</p>
<p>Moreover, this is just as much a feather in Apple’s cap as the commoditization of everything is a black mark: Apple creates devices — tools — that let everyone be a creator. Indeed, that is why the ad works in both directions: the flattening of everything means there has been a loss; the flattening of everything also means there is entirely new opportunity.</p>
<h3>The AI Choice</h3>
<p>One thing I do credit Apple for is not trying to erase the ad from the Internet — it’s still posted on <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1787864325258162239">CEO Tim Cook’s X account</a> — because I think it’s important not just as a marker of what has happened over the last several years, but also the choices facing us in the years ahead.</p>
<p>The last time I referenced Steve Jobs’ “Bicycle of the Mind” analogy was in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/techs-two-philosophies/">2018’s Tech’s Two Philosophies</a>, where I contrasted Google and Facebook on one side, and Microsoft and Apple on the other: the former wanted to create products that did things for you; the latter products that let you do more things. This was a simplified characterization, to be sure, but, as I noted in that Article, was also related to their traditional positions as Aggregators and platforms, respectively.</p>
<p>What is increasingly clear, though, is that Jobs’ prediction that future changes would be even more profound raise questions about the “bicycle for the mind” analogy itself: specifically, will AI be a bicycle that we control, or an unstoppable train to destinations unknown? To put it in the same terms as the ad, will human will and initiative be flattened, or expanded?</p>
<p>The route to the former seems clear, and maybe even the default: this is a world where a small number of entities “own” AI, and we use it — or are used by it — on their terms. This is the outcome being pushed by those obsessed with “safety”, and demanding regulation and reporting; that those advocates also seem to have a stake in today’s leading models <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/attenuating-innovation-ai/">seems strangely ignored</a>.</p>
<p>The alternative — <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/mkbhds-for-everything/">MKBHDs For Everything</a> — means openness and commoditization. Yes, those words have downsides: they mean that the powers that be are not special, and sometimes that is something we lament, as I noted at the beginning of this Article. Our alternative, though, is not the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/goodbye-gatekeepers/">gatekept world</a> of the 20th century — <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/regretful-accelerationism/">we can’t go backwards</a> — but one where the flattening is not the elimination of vitality but the tilling of the ground so that something — many things — new can be created.</p>

<hr>

<p>Email addresses published on webpages usually need to be protected from email-harvesting spambots.</p>

<p>Conventionally, email protection techniques utilise a combination of <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JS</strong> - though each approach is subject to its own pros and cons.</p>

<p>In general, approaches involving <strong>JS</strong> tend to be more sophisticated than alternatives based on <strong>HTML</strong> and / or <strong>CSS</strong>.</p>

<p>But the downside is that <strong>JS</strong> then becomes an unavoidable dependency of that page.</p>

<p>There is always benefit in considering the school of thought which advocates that while JS may <em>enhance</em> pages, ideally we should want all the essential functionality on those pages to work even while JavaScript is turned off.</p>

<hr>

<p>The technique detailed on this page utilises an an approach entirely different from conventional email protection techniques, based on <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JS</strong>, <strong>CSS + JS</strong> etc.</p>

<p>Because <em>this</em> technique is based on <strong>SVG</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>N.B.</strong> <em>This technique - and any other email-protection technique utilising front-end-technologies - <strong>won’t</strong> protect your published email address from being harvested by the most determined and sophisticated spambots. But, as with many JS-based email-protection techniques, it <strong>will</strong> protect you nevertheless from a great many unsophisticated harvesters and keep your email successfully hidden from any simple or amateurish scripts trawling the web, seeking to copy any unprotected email addresses they find.</em></p>

<h2 id="three-advantages-of-an-svg-based-approach-to-protecting-email-addresses">Three advantages of an SVG-based approach to protecting email addresses</h2>

<h3 id="1-works-with-javascript-turned-off">1. Works with JavaScript turned off</h3>
<p>The main advantage of this <strong>SVG-based approach</strong> to protecting emails, is that it involves <strong>no JavaScript</strong>.</p>

<p>As such, even when a human visitor has their JavaScript turned off, the email address displayed on the page remains usable, accessible and protected, while remaining secure and hidden from spambots.</p>

<h3 id="2-permits-a-standard-mailto-link">2. Permits a standard <code>mailto:</code> link</h3>
<p>Unlike other <em>no-JavaScript-required</em> approaches (e.g. obfuscating email addresses by inserting non-visible HTML Comments or inserting visible elements and subsequently hiding them via CSS), this <strong>SVG-based approach</strong> allows for standard <code>mailto:</code> links. The twist is: the <code>mailto:</code> link exists inside the external <strong>SVG document</strong>, <em>not</em> inside the referring <strong>HTML document</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="3-conceals-content-like-an-image-copyable-like-text">3. Conceals content like an image; Copyable like text</h3>

<p>A third advantage is that embedded <strong>SVGs</strong> are <em>image-like</em> but <em>not</em> images.</p>

<p>As replaced elements embedded within a hypertext document, <strong>SVGs</strong> may conceal an email address from spambots nearly as effectively as an image might.</p>

<p>But, strictly, <strong>SVGs</strong> are <em>graphics documents</em> rather than actual images.</p>

<p>Consequently, <em>unlike with an image</em>, a human visitor may still copy the email address by <strong>right-clicking</strong> on the <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element in the embedded <strong>SVG</strong>.</p>

<p>This would not be possible with a conventional image.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="implementing-the-code">Implementing the Code</h2>

<p>In the example below there are two files.</p>

<p>The SVG graphics document is embedded in the HTML hypertext document via:</p>

<div><pre><code>&lt;object data="svg-email-protection.svg" type="image/svg+xml" /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Note that the same SVG graphics document may be embedded in hypertext once - or multiple times.</p>

<h3 id="html-file">HTML File</h3>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;html</span> <span>lang=</span><span>"en-GB"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;meta</span> <span>charset=</span><span>"utf-8"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;title&gt;</span>SVG Email Protection<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
    
<span>&lt;style&gt;</span>
    
<span>.svg-email-protection</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>24px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>vertical-align</span><span>:</span> <span>middle</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
    
<span>&lt;/style&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;body&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;p&gt;</span>This is my email: <span>&lt;object</span> <span>class=</span><span>"svg-email-protection"</span> <span>data=</span><span>"svg-email-protection.svg"</span> <span>type=</span><span>"image/svg+xml"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="svg-file">SVG File</h3>
<pre><code>&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
     lang="en-GB"
     aria-labelledby="title"
     viewBox="0 0 200 24"&gt;

  &lt;title id="title"&gt;Email Us!&lt;/title&gt;

  &lt;defs&gt;

  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;&lt;![CDATA[

  rect {

    height: 24px;
    fill: rgb(255, 255, 255);
  }

  a:focus rect,
  rect:hover {

  }

  text {

    text-decoration: underline 1px solid rgb(255, 255, 255);
    text-underline-offset: 5px;
  }

  ]]&gt;&lt;/style&gt;

  &lt;/defs&gt;

  &lt;a href="mailto:myemail@mydomain.tld" aria-label="Email Us!"&gt;
    &lt;rect /&gt;
    &lt;text x="50%" y="50%" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="middle"&gt;myemail@mydomain.tld&lt;/text&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/svg&gt;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>

<p>As ever, it’s important to ensure that this setup remains as <strong><em>accessible</em></strong> as possible.</p>

<p>On this basis, note the following in the SVG graphics document:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the entire SVG document is <code>aria-labelledby</code> the SVG document <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, indicating a call-to-action</li>
  <li>the anchor element (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) inside the SVG has an <code>aria-label</code> which has the same call-to-action</li>
  <li>the SVG is styled such that when the <em>tab-focus</em> falls on the anchor element (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>), the child-elements, <code>&lt;rect /&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;text /&gt;</code>, are both highlighted</li>
</ul>

<p>Fireside this week!  Next week, with luck, I’ll have my ‘On the Reign of Alexander III of Macedon’ up as an addendum to our discussion of Hellenistic armies.  But in the meantime, it is a fireside, and I thought, since it was just recently May the Fourth, we might talk some Star Wars (and history).  So this is going to be a bit silly this week.</p>

<p>For this week’s <strong>musing</strong>, over the last week, as part of my May the Fourth celebration (and some enforced post-semester relaxation), I went and built the Lego Star Destroyer my better half bought for me (about a year ago – the space for building it got consumed by other things in the intervening time).  This is not the <em>very old</em> (2002) Star Destroyer kit, nor the very newest (2024) kit, but the finely aged (2019) ‘Ultimate Collector’ set, coming in at a massive 4,700 pieces.  It was fun to build and there’s actually a lot of kind of neat engineering and design that clearly went in to making it work.  With so many pieces, the set is so <em>heavy</em> that it needs a whole reinforcing frame (also made of legos) to hold it together internally.</p>



<p>But that got me thinking about Star Destroyers (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/12/20/collections-starships-in-silhouette/" data-type="post" data-id="1960">not the first time</a>) and Star Wars, so I figured I’d muse a bit at you both about the odd place of Star Destroyers in imperial military doctrine and also the nature of the Old Republic and the Empire as polities.</p>



<p>So let’s star with the obvious about the design of the Imperial Star Destroyer (ISD), which is that it was designed (for the screen) to <em>look</em> a certain way, rather than as a function fighting machine.  And as that sort of design, the ISD is brilliant.  The lower hull seems to have been planned out for that massive opening shot: the long, flat sections make it feel like the ship goes on <em>forever</em>, while the three breaks in the shape (the two docking hangers and the bulge over the reactor) break up the monotony.  The <em>two</em> docking bays, a smaller one first and then a much larger one, also stress the ship’s gargantuan size: the viewer see’s what they think is the primary hanger, and then, wait, no, <em>there’s another, much bigger one</em> and then the ship <em>doesn’t end</em>.  The rear of the ship, with its massive brace of engines, also manages to communicate that this behemoth might also be <em>fast</em> as well as large.  And then when we see the thing from the front, the presence of its raised superstructure immediately communicates its primary role as a battleship, because it has a similar sort of superstructure to WWII-era battleships, with that raised command tower looming over a superstructure above the main structure.  It is simultaneously different enough from any real vehicle to be immediately memorable – not merely a battleship stuck in space – but at the same time, shares enough design language for the audience to intuit its role immediately.</p>



<p>As an aside, I think this is something the ISD design does a lot better than many more recent similar efforts.  Both new Star Wars (particularly the sequel films) and new Star Trek (particularly <em>Discovery </em>and <em>Picard</em>) have a problem with villain ships which are wildly out of scale with the existing designs in the setting, but which are essentially just blown-up versions of existing visual language (<em>Discovery</em>‘s <em>Dreadnought</em> and <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>‘s <em>Xyston</em>-class both come to mind).  Even the First Order Star Destroyers often felt like they had to be massively <em>bigger</em> than the ISD because they otherwise lacked new ideas.  But the ISD itself was pretty fresh as a concept and delivers on it extremely well (and the SSD is a better, “that, but bigger, scarier and in Vadar’s theme colors” variant than anything in the sequel trilogy).</p>



<p>Of course, the ISD initially existed without any context – it is the <em>second</em> thing we see on screen after the crawl (not counting planets) – but it eventually got one, a design lineage from the Republic-era <em>Venator</em>.  And this creates a bit of an oddity, because in the Clone Wars, the Republic fleet is essentially built around fast carriers – the <em>Venators</em> – and their fighters, whereas it is the CIS fleet which has specialized gunboats (along with the slower Lucrehulks that function as carriers), but by the time we get to the Empire, the doctrine has switched: the ISD is clearly a gun platform first and foremost, which carries its own fighter screen, but expects to win with its primary battery, not its (flimsy) TIE-Fighters, while it is the Rebellion that eventually adopts a fast-carrier kind of doctrine.</p>



<p>Now, the out-of-universe reason for this is that George Lucas thinks it is cool to have the protagonists flying fighters against big enemy battleships and so that is the doctrine he gives to the ‘good guys’ in each films.  I wonder if that is itself an influence from the Second World War (and the war films Lucas studied to block out his space battle sequences), where the early phases (particularly 1942) in the Pacific were the plucky efforts of a few American fast carriers and cruisers against fleets loaded with imposing-looking battleships.  It also, of course, makes storytelling sense: the characters we care about can be in the fighters, while the bad guys in their big Death Stars and Star Destroyers are distant, powerful and imposing.</p>



<p>But it creates a lore problem, which is, ‘why did the Galactic Empire entirely change its doctrine <em>after</em> winning the Clone Wars?’  ‘Legends’ canon – that is, the pre-Disney canon – had its answer, which is that ‘it didn’t.’  Instead, there was a longer progression of ship designs late in the Clone Wars, from the carrier-oriented <em>Venator</em> and <em>Accalamator</em> to the up-gunned version, the <em>Victory</em>-class Star Destroyer (VSD), which was supposed to be a late-Clone Wars design which serves as the bridge from to the ISD.  With the VSD in the design lineage, the ISD makes sense: the Empire deployed, late in the war, a more gun-based platform, then won the war and continued development along that ‘successful’ design lineage, producing an extreme version of the VSD in the ISD.</p>



<p>The Canon (‘Disney-Canon’) <em>technically</em> has the same narrative (the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Victory-class_Star_Destroyer" data-type="link" data-id="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Victory-class_Star_Destroyer">VSD is technically still canon, according to Wookiepedia</a>), but has never put the VSD on screen. In the scenes where we <em>ought</em> to see a transitional VSD, we instead see an ISD, and the new canon has also removed one of the main ‘Legends’ advantages the VSD had: in legends, the VSD was capable of atmospheric flight, but the ISD was not, but in canon, the ISD now can do that. The reason here, I have to assume is that brand new models are expensive and Disney would rather keep reusing and modifying <em>Rogue One</em>‘s very high-quality ISD-I model <em>forever</em> if necessary, even in places where it makes no sense, like for the <em>Xyston</em>-class or in games set after the Battle of Endor. If Disney can’t be bothered to make a high-detail ISD-II model, they surely can’t be bothered to work up a new VSD model.</p>

<p>But I think I can actually puzzle out a ‘history of the Galactic Empire’ which makes a bit of sense and into which the ISD has an understandable – if not <em>sound</em> – doctrinal place.  First, we need to understand what kind of polity the Old Republic – and thus the Empire – <em>is</em>.  And here, the phrasing I go to (somewhat imprecise) is that the Republic was a ‘Republic of Princes’ in the same sense that the Holy Roman Empire was an empire of ‘princes’ or more technically ‘imperial states.’<span id="easy-footnote-2-23926"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-23926" title="As I understand it in technical terms, a &amp;#8216;prince&amp;#8217; of the HRE was a direct vassal of the emperor; many imperial states were &amp;#8216;princes&amp;#8217; &amp;#8211; including some archbishoprics &amp;#8211; but not all were.  However, I find when explaining this to folks, the idea of a &amp;#8216;government of princes&amp;#8217; makes a lot more sense than &amp;#8216;a government of states.&amp;#8217;"><sup>2</sup></a></span>  I promise we will get back to Star Destroyers here eventually.</p>



<p>In short, the Republic was not a democracy of <em>people</em> but a republic of <em>states</em>, the ‘princes’ which in turn governed their own territory internally.  These ‘princes’ could be any form of government.  And indeed, the imperial states of the Holy Roman Empire could be noble rulers, but also bishops ruling cities (the ‘prince-archbishops’), monks running abbeys (Imperial prelates), grandmasters running holy orders, and even cities governing themselves (free and imperial cities).  So too with the Republic, which is why the Trade Federation can sit on the Senate alongside democratic Naboo and monarchic Alderaan.</p>



<p>Crucially, each of these ‘princes’ is internally self-governing, but also has its own military, some large and some small, and its own resource base with which to <em>develop</em> such a military.</p>



<p>Given that, what I think a historian of this period, looking back would conclude about the Star Wars story would be this: the Clone Wars were essentially a civil war between the princes of the Rim territories against the princes of the core regions (as the later effectively ruled the senate).  That civil war produced political momentum among some of the core princes towards centralization, which fuels the career of Palpatine.  Palpatine’s reign and the Empire in general is thus understood as a reaction to the Clone Wars primarily aimed at centralizing power at the expense of the princes.</p>



<p>That in turn produced two related reactions.  On the one hand, it produces obvious discontent among the ‘princes’ themselves – the ruling classes of these planets.  The Bail Organas and Mon Mothmas.  But the centralization also begins to disintermediate the princely governments themselves, suddenly exposing their citizens to <em>direct</em> rule by the empire (we see this quite clearly in <em>Andor</em>) and it turns out, they don’t like it.  After all, you have to imagine generations of local government means all of these planets have different assumptions about their rights and customs, and now here comes the Stormtroopers attempting to institute <em>one</em> law and <em>one</em> custom.  That creates a separate but symbiotic <em>popular</em> movement against the empire, which the princes are able to co-opt into their rebel alliance, promising that a return to princely government will mean a return to the traditional liberties and customs.</p>



<p>As this is happening, the Imperial Navy is in a state of change.  During the Clone Wars, it was fighting a peer adversary using a fast-carrier doctrine aiming to win a war that was already raging.  But now there are <em>simmering</em> tensions which the Imperial Navy is supposed to tamp down.  As a result, imperial designers reach for <strong>escalation dominance</strong> in their designs, aiming to build ships which can, on their own, <em>intimidate</em> the militaries of the princes – because remember, the ‘princes’ (planetary governments of whatever form) <em>all have their own</em> <em>small navies</em> – in order to avoid a conflict.  The ISD is the end result of that design philosophy: a gun-platform powerful enough to be effectively beyond the ability of any planetary princely navy to fight effectively.</p>



<p>Those same designers are <em>also</em>, of course, dealing with a bubbling hit-and-run insurgency, which manifests as popular insurgents whose weapons and resources clearly suggest they are being funded and supplied, in secret, by some of the princes.  Those same imperial designers respond by emphasizing <strong>force protection</strong>, to try to keep the key imperial assets well-enough armored and defended so as to limit the damage of ambush and hit-and-run.  In this sense, an ISD is a gigantic MRAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected vehicle; a kind of vehicle designed for the Global War on Terror).  Sure, it’s less <em>practical</em> than the more Humvee-like <em>Venators</em>, but its size and firepower places it beyond the capability of rebel hit-and-run attacks, allowing it to deliver its troops and firepower in safety.</p>



<p>Of course, it risks exactly the same problem that MRAPs do: troops buttoned up on their force-protection-oriented vehicles may be safe (though they may not be), but they’re not <em>accomplishing the mission</em>.  But what the ISD avoids is getting weekly reports about losing a few ships here and there as these irritatingly well-funded rebels pick off this or that small force.  Instead, imperial force is concentrated in a handful of mega-platforms that are effectively beyond attack.</p>



<p>The immediate problem, though, is that building a huge navy of brand new massive Space-MRAP-Battleships is probably really expensive, with the massive cost increasing dissatisfaction among the princes and the people, fueling the discontent already simmering in frustrations about this centralizing government.  Finally in 0BBY, the Empire makes its disastrous move: deciding that the best course of action would be to intimidate the princes by beheading one of them (Alderaan) as an example to the others, while disbanding the senate and essentially abolishing princely rule.  But like Ferdinand II marching into Bohemia and the Palatinate in 1618-9, this assertion of direct imperial power ends up triggering a more general revolt of the princes (intensified, of course, by the fact that the Empire <em>loses the Death Star</em> almost immediately, meaning the threat meant to keep the princes in line while their administrations were dismantled had vanished).</p>



<p>From that point, the Empire actually unravels quite quickly: slow, grinding centralization had taken two decades from the end of the Clone Wars to the Battle of Yavin, but from the Battle of Yavin to Endor is just five years.  The problem is a classic feature of military-tributary empires: an army can intimidate many enemies, but it can only fight one, so once the state has to turn potential force into deployed violence, the intimidation value of those armies collapses in the absence of bedrock legitimacy to keep people in line without force, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/07/07/collections-the-status-quo-coalition/" data-type="post" data-id="19921">as every actor in the systems’ interests suddenly recalculate against hegemony and towards balancing</a>.</p>



<p>The Rebel Alliance, constructing a navy from scratch, builds one to the doctrine of the last peer-conflict, the Clone Wars, thus a fast-carrier oriented force, while the Empire, saddled with high costs is stuck with the ships it has: giant Space-MRAPs designed to intimidation and counter-insurgency.  But with the princes broadly in revolt, what the Empire increasingly has on its hands is actually a peer, conventional conflict.  The issue comes to a head at Endor, where the Emperor tries a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dien_Bien_Phu" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dien_Bien_Phu">Dien Bien Phu</a>-gambit with the same historical results: thinking he can lure the rebels into a conventional battle and win, he does so but finds to his dismay that the balance of conventional forces is not so lopsided as he hoped.</p>



<p>Naturally a later historian is going to be unaware of the personal elements of the story, but “the emperor, having clearly bungled the strategy and unwilling to change course – I mean, he built a <em>second</em> Death Star – is assassinated by his close associates (Darth Vader) who remain loyal <em>to the empire, just not the emperor</em> and hope to change strategy” is a pretty standard way for dynasties to end.  And what we get after Endor is a pretty standard way that gambit often plays out, with imperial forces fragmenting instead of congealing around a new strategy.  Unable to coalesce around a new strategy or a new leader, the remains of the emperor’s half-built centralized government are dismantled by the princes who then reestablish the old Republic of Princes, albeit with some more centralized components (a central military, for instance) kept.  Restoring the intermediate layer between the Galactic government and the regular people perhaps does calm popular anger as well, as local rulers are better able to handle local issues (in a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuius_regio,_eius_religio" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuius_regio,_eius_religio">cuius regio, eius religio</a></em> sort of way).</p>



<p>As a coda, one of the things I liked in the old Legends canon that we haven’t seen on-screen, at least, in the new Disney-canon was that the New Republic’s centralized military – something they keep from the Clone Wars experience, evidently – ended up having lots of imperial ships, including ISDs and even SSDs.  Which makes a lot of sense: having reasserted control, one of the things the princes want both for themselves and to deliver to their newly-quite-well-armed populations is lower taxes and thus less naval spending.  But less naval spending doesn’t mean that you build smaller, cheaper ships: <em><strong>it means you keep the old ships</strong></em>.  So the New Republic isn’t going to build a new, cheaper navy, but look for ways to repurpose this pile of giant Space-MRAPs they’ve inherited from the defunct empire, alongside their Ferix-Junkyard collection of ships from the war.  I’d absolutely expect, then, to see some newly blue-trimmed Star Destroyers, employed as the flagships for Republic Navy task forces, even as New Republic officers complain about how poorly suited they are for the role and New Republic designers draw up endless new plans for high-tech, highly capable fast-carrier designs that they can never get funding to build at scale.</p>



<p>And then, of course, fortunately, the story just sort of trails off, because the notion that some insurgent power in the outer rim would conjure into existence not one but <em>two</em> fleets of Star Destroyers out of nothing with no one noticing and casually overthrow this entire system <em>off-screen</em> between movies is the daft sort of thing which would only have been excusable if paired with really good character work, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/12/29/miscellanea-the-latest-jedi/" data-type="post" data-id="1956">if anyone had bothered to do any</a>.</p>

<p>On to <strong>recommendations</strong>!</p>



<p>Excavations in Pompeii turned up some <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68777741" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68777741">remarkable new frescoes of mythological scenes</a> earlier this month, which you can see in this BBC report.  I am always struck by the focus in domestic Greek and Roman artwork on mythological scenes which are often, at least to my mind, deeply fraught; Apollo and Cassandra (where the former is about the curse the latter for her chastity) is hardly what I would want in my dining room, but the ancients seem to have preferred scenes of high emotional and moral tension, even if it was unpleasant tension.  CUNY Professor in Classics and History Liv Yarrow offers some <a href="https://livyarrow.org/2024/04/12/new-pompeii-images/" data-type="link" data-id="https://livyarrow.org/2024/04/12/new-pompeii-images/">additional thoughts on the frescoes on her blog</a>, which I’ll also recommend generally for her musings about ancient material culture objects, their mysteries and what we can understand from them.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Cardiff University’s Flint Dibble wrote in <em>The Guardian</em> about<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/28/lost-civilisations-make-good-tv-ancient-apocalypse-but-archaeology-real-stories-hold-far-more-wonder" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/28/lost-civilisations-make-good-tv-ancient-apocalypse-but-archaeology-real-stories-hold-far-more-wonder"> his experiences as an <em>actual</em> archaeology taking on pseudo-archaeological nonsense</a>.  I agree with Dibble that the <em>actual</em> past that archaeology reveals to us is more interesting and wondrous than the wild fantasies that pseudo-archaeologists project on it, in no small part because the real past can surprise and challenge us in a way that psuedo-archaeology cannot, as it is always just a distorted mirror of our own biases and assumptions.  It is, however, profoundly frustrating how major outlets, like Netflix, continue to present nonsense peddlers as if they are asking unanswered questions, rather than asking <em>extensively</em> answered questions, the answers of which they steadfastly refuse to read.</p>



<p>Over at the <em>Partial Historians</em>, I want to pick out a really neat special guest episode from about a month ago on the <a href="https://partialhistorians.com/2024/03/28/special-episode-augustus-mausoleum-with-dr-victoria-austen/" data-type="link" data-id="https://partialhistorians.com/2024/03/28/special-episode-augustus-mausoleum-with-dr-victoria-austen/">Mausoleum of Augustus</a>, with Dr. Victoria Austen.  The mausoleum is one of those monuments in Rome that gets a bit less attention from tourists, and has been undergoing preservation work (and thus not open to the public) for quite a while now.  But the conversation between Drs. Radform, Greenfield and Austen, I think, is a really useful way to think about how the mausoleum fits in with Augustus’ building program, but also his use of space generally on the Campus Martius (the area of Rome it was in), as well as discussing the way that monuments like that get reused, repurposed and re-imagined by subsequent generations.</p>



<p>Finally, on a gaming note, I just wanted to point out game-analysis YouTuber Rosencreutz has <a href="https://youtu.be/LkCWeYsGA8g?si=ts7TcTeoAFunE7g-" data-type="link" data-id="https://youtu.be/LkCWeYsGA8g?si=ts7TcTeoAFunE7g-">a long video-essay putting the cult-classic <em>Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines</em> in the context of the broader genre of ‘vampire games’ </a>that I found quite interesting.  Rosencreutz videos are an interesting sort because they tend to be ruminations on a theme rather than focused deep-dives of a single game (the more common format), but they are often insightful.  I’ll also shout out his take a few months ago on “Valkyria Chronicles, Persecution, and Atrocity” for making an argument I’ve thought for some time: that it is strange and also quite interesting that one of the more <a href="https://youtu.be/Xo0uoG7FgxM?si=UEIg0_BjsV0YMjSh" data-type="link" data-id="https://youtu.be/Xo0uoG7FgxM?si=UEIg0_BjsV0YMjSh">serious takes on the holocaust in gaming is to be found in an alternate-universe anime-WWII tactics game</a>.  His channel is well worth if you are interested in thoughtful analysis of the themes and ideas in video games.</p>



<p>For this week’s <strong>book recommendation</strong>, I want to recommend J. Lyall, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/4dCRxwE" data-type="link" data-id="https://amzn.to/4dCRxwE">Divided Armies: Inequality &amp; Battlefield Performance in Modern War</a></em> (2020), a book I am legitimately surprised I have not already recommended and which is well on its way to becoming one of those modern classics of military history scholarship.  The central argument of the book is actually quite easy to state and fairly intuitive: armies with a high degree of inequality – specifically inequality of membership in the political community – suffer recognizable pathologies that cause them to perform more poorly than they might otherwise have done on the battlefield.  Alert readers will pick up from our series on Hellenistic and Roman armies that I have been noodling around my own version of this argument for those ancient armies (indeed, since before this book was published; you can see the foundations of my ideas on this back in my 2018 dissertation), so Lyall’s book came like a bolt of deliverance: here was a sustained, focused study of the modern instantiation of a phenomenon I thought I could detect in ancient armies.</p>



<p>Of course it is easy to make the observation that it <em>seems</em> like high levels of inequality negatively impact combat performance, but it is another thing to <em>prove</em> it.  Lyall comes at this problem with a political science methodology, which is to say that the foundation of the book is a quantitative approach which seeks to measure – in numbers – inequality (a ‘military inequality coefficient’) and battlefield performance (a ‘battlefield performance index’) and then compare the two.  These sorts of quantitative approaches almost invariably lead historians to cry foul and I will admit I have some <em>concerns</em> about the quite subjective foundations of these apparently objective, quantitative coefficients and indexes.   If that was all there was, I’d be concerned.  But that isn’t all there is.  Indeed, Lyall spends relatively few of his pages on the quantitative aspects of the study and instead buttresses the validity of his figures with a series of detailed, well-developed case studies running from 1800 to 1942.  That said, I also think Lyall’s definition of inequality is actually a really good one, focusing in not on economic inequality or even political representation but on inequality of membership in a political community: who is considered a full member of the polity, who <em>belongs</em> even in polities where belonging doesn’t bring a certain economic standard of living or set of political rights.  As Lyall, I think, demonstrates well, when it comes to military effectiveness, this is the question that matters.</p>



<p>Lyall makes a strong effort (noted in a forward) to try to make the book approachable and consequently confined much of the technical matter to appendices available online.  But I think for the reader looking for the <em>general</em> insight of the negative impact of inequality within armies (rather than the particular, quantitative relationship), the case studies carry the necessary weight.  These are delivered in plain language and with enough context for the reader to follow, and with a historian’s granularity in following the course of specific key moments.  The result is a book that, as long as one kind of skims the quantitative sections (or, as one of my mentors once quipped, of a different political science work’s quantitative chapter, “don’t read it, but don’t skip it”), is very readable and even quite engaging.  More to the point, its a very valuable working, taking something I think many of us kind of knew in a general sense (‘inequality damages army performance’) and providing a focused, in-depth study of the phenomenon in both particular cases and in general that puts substance behind that general sense.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page-wrapper">

            <div id="content" class="page">
                    <main>
                        <h2 id="did-github-copilot-really-increase-my-productivity"><a href="#did-github-copilot-really-increase-my-productivity">Did GitHub Copilot really increase my productivity?</a></h2>
<p>I had free access to GitHub Copilot for about a year, I used it, got used to it, and slowly started to take it for granted, until one day it was taken away. I had to re-adapt to a life without Copilot, but it also gave me a chance to look back at how I used Copilot, and reflect - had Copilot actually been helpful to me?</p>
<p>Copilot definitely feels a little bit magical when it works. It's like it plucked code straight from my brain and put it on the screen for me to accept. Without it, I find myself getting grumpy a lot more often when I need to write boilerplate code - "Ugh, Copilot would have done it for me!", and now I have to type it all out myself. That being said, the answer to my question above is a very definite "no, I am more productive without it". Let me explain.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer!</strong> This article only talks about my own personal experiences, as you will be able to see, the kind of code I ask Copilot to write is probably a little bit atypical. Still, if you are contemplating if you should pay for Copilot, I hope this article can serve as a data point. Also, I want to acknowledge that generative AI is a hot-potato topic right now - Is it morally good? Is it infringing copyright? Is it fair that companies train their model on open source code then benefit from it? Which are all very very important problems. However please allow me to put all that aside for this article, and talk about productivity only.</p>
<p>OK, let me give you some background first. For reasons you can probably guess, I do not use Copilot for my day job. I use it for my own projects only, and nowadays most of my free time is spent on a singular project - <a href="https://github.com/yshui/picom">picom</a>, a X11 compositor, which I am a maintainer of. I am not sure how many people reading this will know what a "compositor" is. It really is a dying breed after all, given the fact X11 is pretty much at its end-of-life, and everyone is slowly but surely moving to wayland. Yes, each of the major desktop environments comes with its own compositor, but if you want something that is not attached to any DE, picom is pretty much the only option left. Which is to say, it is a somewhat "one of a kind" project.</p>
<p>Of course, as is the case with any software projects, you will be able to find many commonly seen components in picom: a logging system, string manipulation functions, sorting, etc. But how they all fit together in picom is pretty unique. As a consequence, large scale reasoning of the codebase with Copilot is out of the window. Since it has not seen a project like this during training, it's going to have a really hard time understanding what it's doing. Which means my usage of Copilot is mostly limited to writing boilerplates, repetitive code, etc. To give a concrete example, say you need to <a href="https://github.com/yshui/picom/blob/311225be4d9187cbadf7388af87946d9fa62a924/src/c2.c#L1044">parse an escaped character</a>:</p>
<pre><code>if (pattern[offset] == '\\') {
	switch (pattern[offset + 1]) {
	case 't': *(output++) = '\t'; break;
	// ????
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you put your cursor at the position indicated by <code>????</code>, you can pretty reliably expect Copilot to write the rest of the code for you. Other examples include <a href="https://github.com/yshui/picom/blob/311225be4d9187cbadf7388af87946d9fa62a924/src/c2.c#L238">mapping enums to strings</a>, <a href="https://github.com/yshui/picom/blob/311225be4d9187cbadf7388af87946d9fa62a924/src/dbus.c#L1421">write glue functions that have a common pattern</a>, etc. In other words, the most simple and boring stuff. Which is very good. See, I am someone who wants programming to be fun, and writing these boring, repetitive code is the least fun part of programming for me. I am more than delighted to have someone (or rather, something) take it away from me.</p>
<p>So, what is wrong then? Why did I say I am more productive without Copilot? Well, that's because Copilot has two glaring problems:</p>
<h3 id="1-copilot-is-unpredictable"><a href="#1-copilot-is-unpredictable"><strong>1. Copilot is unpredictable</strong></a></h3>
<p>Copilot can be really really helpful when it gets things right, however, it's really difficult to predict what it will get right, and what it won't. After a year of working with Copilot, I would say I am better at that than when I first started using it, but I have yet to fully grasp all the intricacies. It is easy to fall into the trap of anthropomorphising Copilot, and trying to gauge its ability like you would a human. For instance, you might think, "Hmm, it was able to write that function based on my comments, so it must be able to write this too". But you are more than likely to be proven wrong by the chunk of gibberish Copilot throws at you. This is because, Artificial Intelligence is very much unlike Human Intelligence. The intuition you've developed through a lifetime's interaction with other humans, is not going to work with an AI. Which means, short of letting Copilot actually try, there is oftentimes no surefire way to know whether it's going to work or not. And this problem is compounded by the other big problem of Copilot:</p>
<h3 id="2-copilot-is-slooooow"><a href="#2-copilot-is-slooooow"><strong>2. Copilot is <em>slooooow</em></strong></a></h3>
<p><code>clangd</code>, my C language server of choice, is very fast. It's faster than I can type, which means practically speaking, its suggestions are instant. Even when the suggestions are unhelpful, it costs me nothing. I don't have to pause, or wait, so my flow is uninterrupted. Compared to that, Copilot is much <em>much</em> slower. I would wait at least 2~3 seconds to get <em>any</em> suggestion from Copilot. If Copilot decided, for whatever reason, to write a large chunk of code, it would take a lot longer. And in many instances I would wait all those seconds only to see Copilot spit out unusable code. And I would have to decide if I need to refine the instructions in comments and try again; or partially accept the suggestion and do the rest myself. Even though this doesn't happen <em>that</em> often, (after you have gotten to know Copilot a bit better), much time is wasted in the back-and-forth.</p>
<hr>
<p>So yeah, that's pretty much all I have to say. At least at this very moment, I do not think Copilot will improve my productivity, so I definitely wouldn't be paying for it. If GitHub's plan was to give me a year's free access of Copilot to get me addicted, then their plot has conclusively failed. But that being said, if Copilot is a little bit smarter, or several times faster than it currently is, maybe the scale will tip the other way.</p>
<p>Hmm, should I be scared?</p>

<p>In the last few years we’ve focused a great deal of our work on making AI use less compute (e.g. <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/based">Based</a>, <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-12-11-truly-subquadratic">Monarch Mixer</a>, <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-01-20-h3">H3</a>, <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-06-08-hyena-safari">Hyena</a>, <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2022-06-11-simplifying-s4">S4</a>, among others) and run more efficiently on the compute that we have (e.g. <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-01-12-flashattention-long-sequences">FlashAttention</a>, <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-07-17-flash2">FlashAttention-2</a>, <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-11-13-flashfftconv">FlashFFTConv</a>). Lately, reflecting on these questions has prompted us to take a step back, and ask two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does the hardware actually want?</li>
<li>And how can we give that to it?</li>
</ul>
<p>This post is a mixture of practice and philosophy. On the practical side, we’re going to talk about what we’ve learned about making GPUs go brr -- and release an embedded DSL, <a href="https://github.com/HazyResearch/ThunderKittens">ThunderKittens</a>, that we’ve built to help us write some particularly speedy kernels (which we are also <a href="https://github.com/HazyResearch/ThunderKittens/tree/main/examples">releasing</a>). On the philosophical side, we’ll briefly talk about how what we’ve learned has changed the way we think about AI compute.</p>
<h2>What's in an H100?</h2>
<p>For this post, we’re going to focus on the NVIDIA H100 for two reasons. First, it represents an awful lot of new compute going online. Second, we think the trends it implies are going to continue in future generations, and probably from other manufacturers, too. But bear in mind (and we will repeat in case you forget) that most of this post applies in some form to other GPUs, too.</p>

<p>Advance apologies for restating the data sheet, but the details of the hardware are important for the discussion to come. An H100 SXM GPU contains, for our purposes:</p>

<li>80 GB of HBM3 with 3 TB/s of bandwidth. (A bit less bandwidth in practice.)</li>
<li>50 MB of L2 cache with 12 TB/s of bandwidth, split across the GPU into two 25MB sections connected by a crossbar. (The crossbar sucks.)</li>
<li>132 streaming multiprocessors (SM’s), where each has:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>up to 227 KB of shared memory within a 256 KB L1 cache. (Together, these have about 33 TB/s of bandwidth.)</li>
<li>a tensor memory accelerator (TMA) -- a new chunk of hardware in Hopper that can do asynchronous address generation and fetch memory. It also does other things like facilitate the on-chip memory network (distributed shared memory) but we’re not going to focus on this much, today.</li>
<li>4 quadrants, where each quadrant has:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>A warp scheduler</li>
<li>512 vector registers (each containing 32 4-byte words)</li>
<li>A tensor core for matrix multiplies</li>
<li>A bunch of built-in instructions like sums, multiplies, that operate in parallel on these vector registers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a lot of other stuff, too (memory controllers, instruction caches, etc) but we don’t care about any of that right now.</p>
<p>All of the compute happens in the SM’s. <em>Most</em> of it happens in the registers.</p>
<p><em>Great, how do I make it go brr?</em></p>
<p>Keep the tensor core fed. That’s it.</p>
<p><em>Wait, really?</em></p>
<p>Yes. That’s the game.</p>
<p>An H100 GPU has 989 TFLOPs of half-precision matrix multiply compute, and ~60 TFLOPs of “everything else”. So, every cycle the tensor core is in use, you’re getting at least 94% utilization of the hardware. And every cycle the tensor core is not in use, you’re getting no more than 6% utilization of the hardware. Put another way:</p>
<p>% utilization H100 = % tensor cores active cycles +/- 6%.</p>
<p>Now it turns out that keeping the tensor core fed is easier said than done. We’ve discovered a number of quirks to the hardware that are important to keeping the matrix multiplies rolling. Much of this also applies to non-H100 GPUs, but the H100 is particularly tricky to keep fed so we focus on it here. (The RTX 4090, by comparison, is very easy to work with as illustrated in figure 2.)</p>
<ul>
<li>WGMMA instructions are necessary but also really irritating to use.</li>
<li>Shared memory is not actually that fast and also requires great care.</li>
<li>Address generation is expensive.</li>
<li>Occupancy remains helpful, and registers are generally the key resource.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s go through each of these in order.</p>
<h3>WGMMA Instructions</h3>
<p>The H100 has a new set of instructions called “warp group matrix multiply accumulate” (<code>wgmma.mma_async</code> in PTX, or <code>HGMMA</code>/<code>IGMMA</code>/<code>QGMMA</code>/<code>BGMMA</code> in SASS). To understand what makes them special, we need to look briefly at how you used to have to use tensor cores. The tensor core instructions available on previous GPUs were <code>wmma.mma.sync</code> and <code>mma.sync</code> instructions. With these instructions a warp of 32 threads on a single quadrant of an SM would synchronously feed their chunk of the data into the tensor core and await the result. Only then could they move on.</p>
<p>Not so with <code>wgmma.mma_async</code> instructions. Here, 128 consecutive threads -- split across all quadrants of the SM -- collaboratively synchronize, and asynchronously launch a matrix multiply directly from shared memory (and optionally also registers.) These warps can then go do other things with their registers while the matrix multiply happens, and await the result whenever they want.</p>
<p>In our microbenchmarks, we found that these instructions are necessary to extract the full compute of the H100. Without them, the GPU seems to top out around 63% of its peak utilization; we suspect this is because the tensor cores want a deep hardware pipeline to keep them fed, even from local resources.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the memory layouts for these instructions <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-register-fragment-wgmma-64n16">are</a> <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-shared-memory-layout">quite</a> <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-shared-memory-layout-swizzling-modes">complicated</a>. The unswizzled shared memory layouts suffer from very poor coalescing, and so they require substantial additional bandwidth from L2. The swizzled memory layouts are flat-out incorrectly documented, which took considerable time for us to figure out. They’re also brittle, in that they appear to only work for specific matrix shapes and do not play well with other parts of the wgmma.mma_async instructions. For example, the hardware can transpose sub-matrices on its way to the tensor cores -- but only if the layout is not swizzled.</p>
<figure><img src="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2024-05-12-tk/lies.png"><figcaption><p>Figure 3: NVIDIA’s <span><em>lies</em></span>. This is an extraordinarily misleading representation of the actual 128b swizzled wgmma layout. This diagram cost us three weeks of life that we will not get back, hence the public shaming.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>We’ve also found that unswizzled wgmma layouts have both poor memory coalescing as well as bank conflicts. On kernels such as flash attention, TMA and the L2 cache are both fast enough so as to hide these problems reasonably well. But to make the full use of the hardware, memory request must be coalesced and bank conflicts avoided, and then controlling layouts very carefully becomes critical.</p>
<p>Despite these pains, these instructions really are necessary to make full use of the H100. Without them, you’ve already lost 37% of the potential performance of the GPU!</p>
<h3>Shared memory</h3>
<p>Shared memory appears to have a single-access latency of around <a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/2023/07/02/nvidias-h100-funny-l2-and-tons-of-bandwidth/">30 cycles</a> (this matches our observations, too). That doesn’t sound like much, but in that time the SM’s tensor cores could have done almost two full 32x32 square matrix multiplies.</p>
<p>In previous work (like Flash Attention), we’ve focused more on the HBM-SRAM bottleneck. And indeed: this really used to be the bottleneck! But as HBM has gotten faster and the tensor cores continue to grow out of proportion with the rest of the chip, even relatively small latencies like those from shared memory have also become important to either remove or hide.</p>
<p>Shared memory can be tricky to work with because it is “banked” into 32 separate stores of memory. If one is not careful, this can lead to something called “bank conflicts”, where the same memory bank is being asked to simultaneously provide multiple different pieces of memory. This leads to requests being serialized, and in our experience this can disproportionately slow down a kernel -- and the register layouts required by wgmma and mma instructions would naively suffer from these bank conflicts. The solution is to rearrange shared memory with various “swizzling” patterns so as to avoid these conflicts, but it is an important detail to get right.</p>
<p>More generally, we have found it very valuable to avoid movement between registers and shared memory when possible, and otherwise to use the built-in hardware (wgmma and TMA instructions) to do data movement asynchronously when possible. Synchronous movement using the actual warps is a worst-case fallback with the greatest generality.</p>
<h3>Address Generation</h3>
<p>One interesting quirk of the H100 is that the tensor cores and memory are both fast enough that merely producing the memory addresses to fetch takes a substantial fraction of the resources of the chip. (This is even more the case when complicated interleaved or swizzling patterns are added in.)</p>
<p>NVIDIA appears to understand this, as they have bestowed on us the Tensor Memory Accelerator (or TMA, as it likes to be called). TMA allows you to specify a multi-dimensional tensor layout in global and shared memory, tell it to asynchronously fetch a subtile of that tensor, and trip a barrier when it’s done. This saves all of the address generation costs, and additionally makes it much easier to construct pipelines.</p>
<p>We have found TMA to be, like wgmma.mma_async, completely indispensable in achieving the full potential of the H100. (Probably moreso than wgmma, in our experience.) It saves register resources and instruction dispatches, and also has useful features such as the ability to perform reductions onto global memory asynchronously, too -- this is particularly useful in complex backwards kernels. As with wgmma, the main quirk of it is that its swizzling modes are a bit difficult to decipher without some reverse engineering, but we had substantially less pain on this point.</p>
<h3>Occupancy</h3>
<p>For those newer to CUDA, occupancy refers to the number of co-scheduled threads on the exact same execution hardware. Each cycle, the warp scheduler on that quadrant of the SM will try to issue an instruction to a warp of threads that are ready for an instruction. NVIDIA uses this model because it can enable the hardware to be more easily kept full. For example, while one warp of threads is waiting for a matrix multiply, another can receive an instruction to use the fast exponential hardware.</p>
<p>In some ways, the H100 is less reliant on occupancy than previous generations of the hardware. The asynchronous features of the chip mean that even a single instruction stream can keep many parts of the hardware busy -- fetching memory, running matrix multiplies, doing shared memory reductions, and still simultaneously running math on the registers.</p>
<p>But occupancy is very good at hiding both sins and sync’s. A perfectly designed pipeline might run reasonably fast even without any additional occupancy, but our observations suggest that NVIDIA really has designed their GPUs with occupancy in mind. And there are enough synchronizations -- and enough ways to make mistakes -- that finding ways to increase occupancy has, in our experience, usually yielded good returns at increasing the realized utilization of the hardware.</p>
<p>Finally, while occupancy is merely useful on the H100, we have found it to be increasingly important on the A100 and RTX 4090, respectively, likely because they rely increasingly on synchronous instruction dispatches, relative to the H100.</p>
<h2>ThunderKittens</h2>
<p>Based on the above, we asked ourselves how we might make it easier to write the kinds of kernels we care about while still extracting the full capabilities of the hardware. Motivated by a continuing proliferation of new architectures within the lab (and the fact that Flash Attention is like 1200 lines of code), we ended up designing a DSL embedded within CUDA -- at first for our own internal use.</p>
<p>But then we decided it was useful enough that, with love in our hearts, we cleaned it up and have released it for you. ThunderKittens is that embedded DSL. It is named ThunderKittens because we think kittens are cute, and also we think it is funny to make you type <code>kittens::</code> in your code.</p>
<figure><img src="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2024-05-12-tk/tk.png"><figcaption><p>Figure 4: A ThunderKitten. Look at her big eyes! Are you not be entranced!?!?</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>It is meant to be as simple as possible, and contains four templated types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Register tiles -- 2D tensors on the register file.</li>
<li>Register vectors -- 1D tensors on the register file.</li>
<li>Shared tiles -- 2D tensors in shared memory.</li>
<li>Shared vectors -- 1D tensors in shared memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tiles are parameterized by a height, width, and layout. Register vectors are parameterized by a length and a layout, and shared vectors just by a length. (They don’t generally suffer from bank conflicts.)</p>
<p>We also give operations to manipulate them, either at the warp level or at the level of a collaborative group of warps. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initializers -- zero out a shared vector, for example.</li>
<li>Unary ops, like exp</li>
<li>Binary ops, like mul</li>
<li>Row / column ops, like a row_sum</li>
</ul>
<p>Since ThunderKittens is embedded within CUDA (contrasting libraries like Triton which we also love very much and rely on heavily), the abstractions fail gracefully. If it’s missing something, just extend it to do what you want!</p>
<p>To show an example of these primitives in action, consider Tri’s lovely flash attention -- a beautiful algorithm, but <a href="https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/blob/main/csrc/flash_attn/src/flash_fwd_kernel.h">complicated</a> to implement in practice, even on top of NVIDIA’s wonderful Cutlass library.</p>
<p>Here's a simple forward flash attention kernel for an RTX 4090, written in ThunderKittens.</p>

<p>Altogether, this is about 60 lines of CUDA sitting at 75% hardware utilization -- and while it is fairly dense, most of the complexity is in the algorithm, rather than in swizzling patterns or register layouts. And what of all of the complexity of TMA, WGMMA, swizzling modes, and descriptors? Here’s a FlashAttention-2 forward pass for the H100, written with ThunderKittens.</p>

<p>So how does it do?</p>
<p>This kernel is just 100 lines, and it actually outperforms FlashAttention-2 on the H100 by about 30%. ThunderKittens takes care of wrapping up the layouts and instructions, and gives you a mini-pytorch to play with on the GPU.</p>
<figure><img src="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2024-05-12-tk/attn.png"><figcaption><p>Figure 5: FA2 (via Pytorch) versus TK for a wide range of configs on the H100 SXM.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>We also release kernels for Based linear attention and other forthcoming architectures, too. Our Based linear attention kernel runs at 215 TFLOPs (or more than 300 TFLOPs when the recompute inherent in the algorithm is considered). And while linear attention is of course theoretically more efficient, historically, they have been dramatically less efficient on real hardware. So we feel this could open up a broad range of high-throughput applications -- more to come on this point later.</p>
<figure><img src="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2024-05-12-tk/based.png"><figcaption><p>Figure 6: Linear attention can be quite quick with TK!</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>If this seems up your alley, feel free to play with it!</p>
<h2>Tiles Seem Like a Good Idea</h2>
<p>In our view, what has made ThunderKittens work well for us is that it does not try to do everything. CUDA is indeed far more expressive than ThunderKittens. ThunderKittens is small and dumb and simple.</p>
<figure><img src="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2024-05-12-tk/theydontknow.png"><figcaption><p>Figure 7: the main message of this blog post.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>But ThunderKittens has good abstractions -- small tiles -- that match where both AI and hardware are going. ThunderKittens doesn’t support any dimension less than 16. But in our view, this doesn’t really matter, since the hardware doesn’t particularly want to, either. And we ask: if your matrix multiply is smaller than 16x16, are you sure what you’re doing is AI?</p>
<p>From a philosophical point of view, we think a frame shift is in order. A “register” certainly shouldn’t be a 32-bit word like on the CPUs of old. And a 1024-bit wide vector register, as CUDA uses, is certainly a step in the right direction. But to us a “register” is a 16x16 tile of data. We think AI wants this -- after all this time, it’s still just matrix multiplies, reductions, and reshapes. And we think the hardware wants this, too -- small matrix multiplies are just begging for hardware support beyond just the systolic mma.</p>
<p>In fact, more broadly we believe we should really reorient our ideas of AI around what maps well onto the hardware. How big should a recurrent state be? As big can fit onto an SM. How dense should the compute be? No less so than what the hardware demands. An important future direction of this work for us is to use our learnings about the hardware to help us design the AI to match.</p>
<h2>Tiles Seem Pretty General</h2>
<p>Coming soon -- ThunderKittens on AMD hardware!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h4>A new preprint study suggests that school-based mindfulness programs, widely implemented in recent years, do not significantly benefit adolescents’ mental health or well-being.</h4>



<p>In the last two decades, mindfulness programs have become increasingly popular in schools across the United States and beyond. </p>



<p>Tens of thousands of students have learned mindfulness techniques like breath awareness, thought observation, and emotional monitoring as part of their regular curriculum.</p><p>The aim of these programs is to equip youth with skills to prevent mental disorders and enhance overall well-being.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/qnk2u" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new preprint study casts doubt</a> on the effectiveness of universal school-based mindfulness interventions (uSBMI) for adolescents.</p>



<p>The study found no significant improvements across a range of mental health outcomes.</p>



<h2>Reanalysis Focuses on Adolescent Outcomes </h2>



<p>The preprint, written by researchers from the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is a re-examination of data from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35820989/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2022 meta-analysis</a> conducted by Darren Dunning and colleagues.</p>



<p>The original meta-analysis synthesized results from randomized controlled trials of mindfulness interventions delivered to both children and adolescents in school settings.</p>



<p>But the current study’s authors noted a limitation in Dunning’s analysis — it did not separately examine the effects of uSBMI on adolescents.</p>



<p>This is a key distinction, as adolescence is a developmental period when the first symptoms of mental disorders often emerge.</p><p>Preventive interventions that work for younger children may be less effective for teens.</p><!-- wp:group {"style":{"border":{"radius":"9px","width":"3px"}},"gradient":"soft-grass","layout":{"type":"constrained"}} -->
<p><!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center"} -->
<h2>What would you like to know about?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:html -->

<!-- /wp:html --></p>
<!-- /wp:group -->



<p>To address this gap, the researchers reanalyzed data from 22 trials that specifically evaluated uSBMI in adolescent populations.</p><p>The studies included a total of 16,558 participants with an average age of 14.2 years.</p>



<h2>No Significant Benefits Found Across Multiple Measures </h2>



<p>The reanalysis assessed uSBMI impacts on seven outcome domains: anxiety/stress, depression, executive functioning, mindfulness, negative behavior, social behavior, and well-being. </p>



<p>These outcomes were measured at two time points — immediately after the intervention and at the longest available follow-up (averaging 7 months).</p>



<p>Across 42 separate analyses examining different outcome categories, control group types, and time points, a remarkable 93% of results were statistically non-significant.</p><p>This means that adolescents who participated in uSBMI fared no better than their peers in control groups on almost all measures.</p>



<p>The few significant findings were inconsistent and hard to interpret.</p><p>Compared to passive controls, <strong>uSBMI actually reduced students’ self-reported mindfulness</strong>, with a small but statistically significant negative effect size (d = -0.10, p &lt; .001).</p>



<p>When measured against active controls, uSBMI did show show some improvements in anxiety/stress and well-being.</p><p>But when all control groups were combined, uSBMI did not significantly impact any outcome.</p>



<h2>Doubts Raised About Mindfulness as Universal Prevention Strategy</h2>



<p>The study’s results raise important questions about the value of uSBMI as a universal prevention approach for adolescents.</p><p>The authors note several potential explanations for the lack of effects, including inadequate “dosage” of mindfulness training, challenges in preparing teachers to deliver the programs, and difficulty implementing the interventions in school settings.</p>



<p>On a broader level, the study challenges the rationale behind uSBMI and similar skill-building programs as a way to prevent mental disorders in teens. </p>



<p>“It is reasonable to wonder,” the paper’s authors write, “whether solving these issues through future research is worth the opportunity cost of lost investment in other programs or policies that could more reliably enhance adolescents’ long-term prospects.”</p>



<h2>Time to Reconsider the Approach?</h2>



<p>As rates of adolescent mental disorders continue to climb, there is an urgent need for effective prevention and early intervention strategies.</p><p>While school-based programs are intuitively appealing, the current study underscores the importance of rigorously evaluating their real-world impacts.</p>



<p>The authors emphasize that their analysis does not necessarily mean mindfulness training has no value for adolescents.</p><p>Yet existing universal programs delivered in school settings do not appear to generate meaningful improvements based on the best available evidence.</p>



<p>Moving forward, researchers and policymakers will need to weigh the opportunity costs of uSBMI against other initiatives that may more reliably support teen mental health. </p>



<p>As the study’s authors conclude, “our reanalysis of meta-analytic data suggest that it is time to reconsider [uSBMI’s] value as a public health prevention strategy for youth.” </p>

This discussion is going to touch a bit on human psychology, and outline a common trap so that you can hopefully avoid getting stuck in it.</p>



<p>Most of my career, both in academia and industry, has been spent trying to optimize dynamically-typed programming languages. During my master’s I worked on a simple optimizing <a href="https://www.sable.mcgill.ca/publications/papers/2010-3/mcvmcc2010.pdf">JIT for MATLAB</a>. For my PhD I worked on a <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol056-ecoop2016/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2016.7/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2016.7.pdf">JIT for JavaScript</a>. Today I’m working on YJIT, an optimizing <a href="https://shopify.engineering/ruby-yjit-is-production-ready">JIT for Ruby</a> which has now been upstreamed into CRuby. </p>



<p>During my PhD, while working on my own JavaScript JIT, I read many papers and blog posts about JIT compilers for other dynamic languages. I read about the design of HotSpot, Self, LuaJIT, PyPy, TruffleJS, V8, SpiderMonkey, and JavaScriptCore among others. I also had the chance to interact with and meet face to face with many of the really smart people behind these projects.</p>



<p>One of the things that struck me is that the PyPy project was kind of stuck in a weird place. They had developed an advanced JIT compiler for Python which could produce <a href="https://speed.pypy.org/">great speedups</a> over CPython. By all accounts many people could benefit from these performance gains, but PyPy was seeing very little use in the “real world”. One of the challenges that they faced is that Python is a moving target. New versions of CPython come out regularly, always adding many new features, and PyPy struggles to keep up, is always several Python versions behind. If you want you Python software to be PyPy-compatible, you’re much more limited in terms of which Python features you use, and most Python programmers don’t want to have to think about that.</p>



<p>Reading about LuaJIT, I found that it was and still is highly regarded. Many people regard its creator, Mike Pall, as an incredible programmer. LuaJIT offers <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/h.vandermeer/docs/lua/luajit/luajit_performance.html">great performance</a> gains over the default, interpreted Lua implementation, and has seen some decent adoption in the wild. However, I again saw that there are a number of Lua users who do not want to use LuaJIT because the Lua language keeps adding new features and LuaJIT is several versions behind. This is a bit strange considering that Lua is a language that is known for its minimalism. It seems like they could have made an effort to slow down the addition of new features and/or coordinate with Mike Pall, but this wasn’t done.</p>



<p>Almost 4 years ago, I joined Shopify to work on Ruby. For some reason, the space of Ruby JITs has been particularly competitive, and there had been a number of projects to build Ruby JITs. The TruffleRuby JIT boasted the most impressive performance numbers, but again, had seen limited deployments. There were some practical reasons for this, the warm up time of TruffleRuby is much longer than that of CRuby, but I also saw a similar dynamic to that of PyPy and LuaJIT, where CRuby kept adding features, and TruffleRuby contributors had to work hard to try and keep up. It didn’t really matter if TruffleRuby could be quite a bit faster, because Ruby users would always view CRuby as the canonical implementation, and anything that wasn’t fully compatible wasn’t seen as worthy of consideration.</p>



<p>Hopefully, at this point, you see where I’m going with this. What I’ve concluded, based on experience, is that positioning your project as an alternative implementation of something is a losing proposition. It doesn’t matter how smart you are. It doesn’t matter how hard you work. The problem is, when you build an alternative implementation, you’ve made yourself subject to the whims of the canonical implementation. They have control over the direction of the project, and all you can do is try to keep up. In the case of JITted implementations of traditionally interpreted languages, there’s a bit of a weird dynamic, because it’s much faster to implement new features in an interpreter. The implementers of the canonical implementation may see you as competition they are trying to outrun. You may be stuck trying to ice skate uphill.</p>



<p>Almost 4 years ago, with support from Shopify, two dedicated colleagues and I started a project to build YJIT, yet another Ruby JIT. The difference is that we made the key choice to build YJIT not as an alternative implementation, but directly inside CRuby itself. This came with a number of design tradeoffs, but critically, YJIT could be 100% compatible with every CRuby feature from the start. YJIT is now the “official” Ruby JIT, and is deployed at Shopify, Discourse and GitHub among others. If you’ve visited github.com today, or any Shopify store, you’ve interacted with YJIT. We’ve had more success than any other Ruby JIT compiler so far, and compatibility has been key in achieving this.</p>



<p>You may read this and think that the key lesson of this post follows the old adage that “if you can’t beat them, join them”. In some ways, I suppose it does. What I want to say is that if you start a project to try and position yourself as an alternative but better implementation of something, you are likely to find yourself stuck in a spot where you’re always playing catch up and living in the shadow of the canonical implementation. The canonical project keeps evolving, and you have no choice but to follow along with limited decisional power over where your own project is headed. That’s no fun. You may have better luck trying to join up with the canonical implementation instead. However, that’s only part of the answer.</p>



<p>In the Ruby space, there is also Crystal, a Ruby-like language that is statically compiled with type inference. This language is intentionally not Ruby-compatible, it has chosen to diverge from Ruby, but has still seen limited success. I think this is interesting because it gives us a broader perspective. Rubyists don’t like Crystal because it’s almost-Ruby-but-not-quite. It looks like Ruby, syntactically, but has many subtle differences and is very much incompatible in practice. This just confuses people, it breaks their expectations. Crystal probably would have had better luck if it had never marketed itself as being similar to Ruby in the first place.</p>



<p>Peter Thiel has a saying that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3D8Vo9hRyw">“competition is for losers”</a>. His main point is that you shouldn’t put yourself in a position where you’re forced to compete if you don’t have to. My advice to younger programmers would be, if you’re thinking of creating your own programming language, for example, then don’t go trying to create a subset of Python, or something superficially very close to an existing language. Do your own thing. That way, you can evolve your system at your own pace and in your own direction, without being chained by expectations that your language should have to match the performance, feature set, or library ecosystem of another implementation.</p>



<p>I’ll finish with some caveats. What I said above applies when you have a situation where there is a canonical implementation of a language or system. It doesn’t apply in a space where you have open standards. For example, if you want to implement your own JSON parser, there is a clearly defined specification that is relatively small and doesn’t evolve very fast. This is very much something you can achieve. You also have a situation where there are multiple browser-based implementations of JavaScript. This is possible in part because there is an external standard body that governs the JS specification, and the people working on the JS standard understand that JIT-compiled implementations are critical for performance and guide the evolution of the language accordingly. They are not in the game of adding many new features as fast as possible.</p>
