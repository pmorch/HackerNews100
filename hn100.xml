			<p>It’s no secret that the Trump administration has fostered a culture of corruption in which special interests and big donors advance their interests at the expense of everyday people. Perhaps no policy area exemplifies this corruption more than the issue of drug pricing.</p>
<p>President Trump has long promised to stand up to the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug prices, but he has avoided taking serious action to drive down prices while at the same time filling top spots in his administration with industry insiders. This administration’s culture of corruption, which continues a decadeslong practice of political pandering to the pharmaceutical industry, carries a real cost; Americans spent&nbsp;$535 billion<a href="#f1" tooltip=""><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;on prescription drugs in 2018, an increase of 50 percent since 2010. These price increases far surpass inflation, with Big Pharma increasing prices on its most-prescribed medications by anywhere from 40 percent to 71 percent from 2011 to 2015.<a href="#f2" tooltip=""><sup>2</sup></a></p>
		</div>
				
					<div data-cap-block-name="wysiwyg - 3">
			<p>Moreover, pharmaceutical companies receive substantial U.S. government assistance in the form of publicly funded basic research and tax breaks, yet they continue to charge exorbitant prices for medications. But the issue goes beyond cost. In America, more than 1 million individuals suffer from Type 1 diabetes<a href="#f3" tooltip=""><sup>3</sup></a>, a condition where the body cannot make insulin, which is essential for getting glucose (also known as blood sugar) into cells from the bloodstream. Without insulin, glucose accumulates in the bloodstream<a href="#f4" tooltip=""><sup>4</sup></a>, causing dangerously high blood sugar levels. Among all Americans suffering from diabetes, at least 1 in 4<a href="#f5" tooltip=""><sup>5</sup></a> have said that they engaged in insulin rationing—a tactic of using less insulin than is needed in order to make the doses last longer—as a direct result of the skyrocketing price of the drug. A vial of insulin, which is the only life-sustaining option for Type 1 diabetics, retails at &nbsp;around $300.<a href="#f6" tooltip=""><sup>6</sup></a> A 2018 study commissioned by the Congressional Diabetes Caucus found that the price of&nbsp;insulin has doubled since 2012<a href="#f7" tooltip=""><sup>7</sup></a>; in the 10 years prior, the price of insulin nearly tripled. Despite the dangers of insulin rationing, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, a fatal condition, many Americans have no other choice. That was the case for&nbsp;Antroinette<a href="#f8" tooltip=""><sup>8</sup></a>, whose daughter was rationing insulin due to the high cost and died at the age of 22 as a result.</p>
<div>
<h3>Insulin facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Access to insulin for patients with Type 1 diabetes is a matter of life or death.<a href="#f9" tooltip=""><sup>9</sup></a></li>
<li>While insulin has existed since the1920s<a href="#f10" tooltip=""><sup>10</sup></a>, the price since then has skyrocketed, especially in recent years. Prices for insulin increased by 197 percent between 2002 and 2013, from $4.34 per milliliter to $12.92 per milliliter.<a href="#f11" tooltip=""><sup>11</sup></a></li>
<li>There are three insulin manufacturers serving the United States: Eli Lilly and Co., Novo Nordisk A/S, and Sanofi SA.</li>
<li>Eli Lillyannounced<a href="#f12" tooltip=""><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;in March 2019 that it would begin selling a generic version of its Humalog insulin at half the price. The medication, known as lispro, will cost $137.35 per vial. To compare pricing,&nbsp;a 2018 study<a href="#f13" tooltip=""><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;estimated that the cost of making a year’s worth of insulin for one patient ranges from $78 to $133.</li>
<li>Ahead of its hearing on drug pricing in February 2019, the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance sent aletter<a href="#f14" tooltip=""><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;to Eli Lilly asking why insulin is priced&nbsp;so astonishingly high. A vial of NovoLog, one type of insulin, costs<a href="#f15" tooltip=""><sup>15</sup></a> anywhere from $14 to $300 in the United States but only $48 in Singapore, $14 in India, $6 in Austria, and $0 in Italy.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>American taxpayers fund basic research</h3>
<p>Billions of taxpayer dollars go into the creation and marketing<a href="#f16" tooltip=""><sup>16</sup></a> of new drugs. <em>The Los Angeles Times</em> reports that, “Since the 1930s, the National Institutes of Health has invested close to&nbsp;$900<a href="#f17" tooltip=""><sup>17</sup></a> billion in the basic and applied research that formed both the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors.” Despite taxpayers’ crucial investment, U.S. consumers are increasingly paying more for their prescription drugs.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;2018&nbsp;study<a href="#f18" tooltip=""><sup>18</sup></a>&nbsp;on the National Institute of Health’s (NIH) financial contributions to new drug approvals found that the agency “contributed to published research associated with&nbsp;every one of the 210&nbsp;new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration from 2010–2016.”&nbsp;More than&nbsp;$100 billion&nbsp;in NIH funding went toward research that contributed directly or indirectly to the 210 drugs approved during that six-year period. The&nbsp;NIH Research Project Grant (R01)<a href="#f19" tooltip=""><sup>19</sup></a>—which supports health-related research—was by far the most common kind of grant used to fund the science that supported the new drugs.&nbsp;In all, NIH gave out nearly 118,000<a href="#f20" tooltip=""><sup>20</sup></a> R01 grants related to those drugs from 2010 to 2016.</p>

			<h3>Federal perks for Big Pharma add up</h3>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies also benefit from research and development tax credits.&nbsp;The federal R&amp;D tax credit was first introduced in 1981 to encourage private sector&nbsp;investment in pioneering research.<a href="#f21" tooltip=""><sup>21</sup></a> This tax credit is available to businesses that attempt to develop new, improved, or&nbsp;technologically advanced products or trade processes.<a href="#f22" tooltip=""><sup>22</sup></a> In 2015, former President Barack Obama signed into law the&nbsp;Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act<a href="#f23" tooltip=""><sup>23</sup></a>, which made these tax credits permanent and extended them to small businesses and startup companies.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical industries also receive a tax deduction for their marketing and advertising expenses. According to a report in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>, “From 1997 through 2016, medical marketing expanded substantially, and spending increased from&nbsp;$17.7 to $29.9 billion,<a href="#f24" tooltip=""><sup>24</sup></a> with direct-to-consumer advertising for prescription drugs and health services accounting for the&nbsp;most rapid growth, and&nbsp;pharmaceutical marketing to health professionals&nbsp;accounting for most promotional spending.” The report also found that from 1997 through 2016, “the number of advertisements … increased from&nbsp;79,000 (including 72,000 television commercials) in 1997 to 4.6 million (663,000 television<a href="#f25" tooltip=""><sup>25</sup></a>&nbsp;commercials) in 2016.”</p>
<h3>Big Pharma’s drug pricing maximizes profits</h3>
<p>Despite these taxpayer subsidies, prescription drug prices are nonetheless increasing at an alarming rate. In 2019, price increases&nbsp;from drug manufacturers affected more than 3,400<a href="#f26" tooltip=""><sup>26</sup></a> drugs. For example, Allergan, a major pharmaceutical manufacturer, raised prices on 51 drugs, just more than half its portfolio. Some medications&nbsp;that Allergan manufactures saw a 9.5 percent jump in cost, while others saw a 4.9 percent increase in cost.<a href="#f27" tooltip=""><sup>27</sup></a> Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the largest generic drug manufacturer in the world,&nbsp;increased its drug prices by more than 9 percent.<a href="#f28" tooltip=""><sup>28</sup></a> These sharp increases in&nbsp;price&nbsp;occur&nbsp;as companies&nbsp;continue to report millions of dollars in revenue. In 2018, Allergan reported $15.8 million<a href="#f29" tooltip=""><sup>29</sup></a> in revenue, while Teva Pharmaceuticals reported $18.8 million<a href="#f30" tooltip=""><sup>30</sup></a> in revenue.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies’ profit margins receive significant bumps when they launch new drugs, specifically specialty drugs, used to treat life-threatening conditions. These drugs often cost more than most Americans can afford. Pharmaceutical companies have stated that the prices are high because the drugs are difficult to manufacture. In 2013, for example, industry giant Gilead Sciences launched Sovaldi, a hepatitis C drug, at $1,000 per pill<a href="#f31" tooltip=""><sup>31</sup></a>, or $84,000<a href="#f32" tooltip=""><sup>32</sup></a> per treatment, which could last 12 to 24 weeks.<a href="#f33" tooltip=""><sup>33</sup></a> After an 18-month investigation into the company’s pricing, the Senate Finance Committee concluded that Gilead had pursued a marketing and pricing strategy designed to “maximize revenue with little concern for access or affordability.”<a href="#f34" tooltip=""><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Drug companies also benefit from patents, which give them monopoly power for their on-patent products. These patents ensure that prices remain high by reducing competition. Drug patents last for 20 years after the filing date. Pharmaceutical companies have also employed tactics such as evergreening and thicketing to prolong a drug’s exclusivity. When evergreening, pharmaceutical companies make certain modifications to a drug such as changing its<a href="#f35" tooltip=""><sup>35</sup></a> chemical composition slightly or making an external change as minor as adding a stripe to a pill<a href="#f36" tooltip=""><sup>36</sup></a> in order to preserve their patents. A 2018 study in the <em>Journal of Law and the Biosciences</em> found that 78 percent<a href="#f37" tooltip=""><sup>37</sup></a> of new drug patents awarded in the past decade went to drugs that already existed. Seventy percent <a href="#f38" tooltip=""><sup>38</sup></a> of the nearly 100 bestselling drugs extended their exclusivity protections at least once, and 50 percent extended their patents more than once. The second tactic—thicketing—involves flooding the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the courts with excessive patents and applications to make it difficult for competing firms to secure patents. These tactics help preserve pharmaceutical companies’ monopolies and ensure that drug prices remain uncompetitive and thus less affordable for everyday Americans.</p>
<p>While consumers continue to pay the price of this market manipulation, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the pharmaceutical industry found that these unfair practices are significantly enriching manufacturers. As the report stated, “Among the largest 25 companies, annual average profit margin fluctuated between&nbsp;15 and 20 percent.”<a href="#f39" tooltip=""><sup>39</sup></a> The GAO contextualizes these profits by comparing the pharmaceutical industry’s profits with those of its counterparts, stating that “the annual average profit margin across non-drug companies among the largest 500 globally fluctuated between 4 and 9 percent.”</p>
<p>In 2018 alone, the CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies Allergan, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Pfizer Inc. made a total of $90 million.<a href="#f40" tooltip=""><sup>40</sup></a> Meanwhile,&nbsp;according to a CBS News report, Americans spent&nbsp;$535 billion<a href="#f41" tooltip=""><sup>41</sup></a> on prescription drugs in 2018—an increase of 50 percent since 2010.<a href="#f42" tooltip=""><sup>42</sup></a> As pharmaceutical industry&nbsp;profits increase<a href="#f43" tooltip=""><sup>43</sup></a>, everyday Americans—whose tax dollars play a critical role in funding the research and development of these medications—are not receiving anything close to a fair return on their investment.</p>
<p>A recent Pew Charitable Trusts study found that Americans spent $65.8 billion<a href="#f44" tooltip=""><sup>44</sup></a> out of pocket in 2016 for retail prescription drugs, up from $59.5 billion in 2012. The high cost of prescription drugs is a significant driver of medical debt<a href="#f45" tooltip=""><sup>45</sup></a> because Americans are increasingly reliant on medication to&nbsp;manage long-term chronic conditions.<a href="#f46" tooltip=""><sup>46</sup></a> Additionally, the high cost of prescription drugs has forced many Americans to take drastic measures, including foregoing taking their medications as prescribed or traveling abroad in order to save on medications. A 2019 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found that 11.4 percent<a href="#f47" tooltip=""><sup>47</sup></a> of adults aged 18 to 64 did not take their prescription drugs as prescribed in order to reduce how much they spent on their medications. And, as NPR recently reported, “The U.S government estimates that close to&nbsp;1 million<a href="#f48" tooltip=""><sup>48</sup></a>&nbsp;Americans&nbsp;in California alone go to Mexico annually for health care, including to buy prescription drugs.” In May 2019,&nbsp;a group of Americans<a href="#f49" tooltip=""><sup>49</sup></a>&nbsp;living with Type 1 diabetes traveled to Canada to purchase insulin and&nbsp;call on&nbsp;the U.S. government to regulate the cost of lifesaving drugs.&nbsp;The costs associated with traveling abroad make it logistically and financially impractical for most Americans. Further, traveling abroad presents certain health risks given that some countries have lax drug certification standards compared with FDA standards.</p>

			<h3>President Trump’s broken promises on drug pricing</h3>
<p>In an interview with <em>Time </em>magazine ahead of being chosen as its Person of the Year in 2016, Trump said, “I’m going to bring down drug prices. I don’t like what’s happened with drug prices.”<a href="#f50" tooltip=""><sup>50</sup></a> He promised to bring Americans’ drug spending down to $0 by negotiating drug prices.<a href="#f51" tooltip=""><sup>51</sup></a> Trump made grandiose promises on drug pricing but almost three years later has only managed to deliver a handful of half-measures, illustrating his administration’s lack of commitment to lowering drug prices. One of Trump’s proposals from his so-called presidential blueprint<a href="#f52" tooltip=""><sup>52</sup></a> included eliminating some rebates paid by drug companies<a href="#f53" tooltip=""><sup>53</sup></a> that hide the true cost of drugs. However, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the measure would actually increase federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid by $177 billion.<a href="#f54" tooltip=""><sup>54</sup></a> The Trump administration also announced a regulation that would require TV ads for drugs to include the list price.<a href="#f55" tooltip=""><sup>55</sup></a> Some experts believe this policy will be ineffective<a href="#f56" tooltip=""><sup>56</sup></a> at making pharmaceutical companies lower list prices or end price hikes for drugs and will only confuse or mislead consumers rather than help them.<a href="#f57" tooltip=""><sup>57</sup></a> These half-measures, combined with Trump surrounding himself with high-level Big Pharma officials, clearly communicates that the administration is not on track to lower drug costs for Americans.</p>
<p>Congress has done little to address the problem of high drug prices. Instead, many members continue to enjoy&nbsp;cozy relationships with the pharmaceutical industry. The industry spent more than&nbsp;$62 million in the 2016 congressional elections—the&nbsp;most it has ever spent on political campaigns.<a href="#f58" tooltip=""><sup>58</sup></a> The massive influx of campaign cash benefited&nbsp;members of both parties, including&nbsp;those that sit on committees with jurisdiction over drug pricing.<a href="#f59" tooltip=""><sup>59</sup></a>&nbsp;Big Pharma’s investment has paid off as recently as July 2019, when the Senate Finance Committee failed to pass an amendment on the&nbsp;Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019, which&nbsp;would have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers.<a href="#f60" tooltip=""><sup>60</sup></a><u>&nbsp;</u>Medicare’s ability to negotiate on drug prices, which is currently prohibited by law, “would provide the leverage needed to lower drug costs.”<a href="#f61" tooltip=""><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite his promise to be tough on Big Pharma, President Trump has proven to be a friend to the industry. Big Pharma officials have filled at least 16<a href="#f62" tooltip=""><sup>62</sup></a> current or former positions in the Trump administration, and many of Trump’s top health advisers have been industry insiders or close to the pharmaceutical companies. Trump’s first secretary of health and human services, former Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), was a longtime friend of the industry<a href="#f63" tooltip=""><sup>63</sup></a> in Congress, where he not only pushed Big Pharma’s agenda but also benefited from it financially.<a href="#f64" tooltip=""><sup>64</sup></a> Price, who drew scrutiny for more than $300,000 in health care stock trades, was eventually forced to resign in 2017<a href="#f65" tooltip=""><sup>65</sup></a> as a result of his illicit use of private jets on the taxpayers’ dime.</p>
<p>In 2017, Trump nominated Joe Grogan<a href="#f66" tooltip=""><sup>66</sup></a> to a top position at the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Grogan spent five years as a lobbyist for Gilead—the pharmaceutical company that is infamous for its sky-high prices on a cure for hepatitis C.<a href="#f67" tooltip=""><sup>67</sup></a> Since joining the administration, Grogan has led drug-pricing proposals and participated in Trump’s Drug Pricing and Innovation Working Group.”<a href="#f68" tooltip=""><sup>68</sup></a> However, the working group has proposed pharma-friendly measures such as implementing monopoly rights outside of the United States, speeding up approval from the FDA for new drugs, and eliminating price cuts for hospitals in impoverished areas.</p>
<p>President Trump chose to replace Price with Alex Azar, the former president of&nbsp;Eli Lilly—one of the companies that is working to keep drug prices high while everyday Americans suffer—to oversee his efforts to address drug pricing as secretary of health and human services.</p>
<p>In 2018, pharmaceutical companies spent more than $283 million in lobbying dollars<a href="#f69" tooltip=""><sup>69</sup></a>, with Eli Lilly spending just less than $6.8 million in 2018.<a href="#f70" tooltip=""><sup>70</sup></a> While Azar, Trump’s chief health adviser, was president of Eli Lilly, the company drastically increased insulin prices. Eli Lilly is currently defending itself against a class-action lawsuit<a href="#f71" tooltip=""><sup>71</sup></a> accusing&nbsp;the company&nbsp;of colluding with pharmacy benefit managers—individuals who negotiate drug pricing and availability with drug companies for&nbsp;the&nbsp;government and other insurance plans—to&nbsp;increase&nbsp;prices. Big Pharma and pharmacy benefit managers have been playing a blame game<a href="#f72" tooltip=""><sup>72</sup></a>&nbsp;while lawmakers—who have held several hearings in the&nbsp;U.S. House of Representatives<a href="#f73" tooltip=""><sup>73</sup></a>&nbsp;and the U.S.&nbsp;Senate<a href="#f74" tooltip=""><sup>74</sup></a>—try to find the source of America’s drug pricing problem.</p>
<p>Given the sway that Big Pharma has with the administration, the industry has no plans to reduce prescription drug prices or reverse past price gouging. For his part, President Trump tried but failed to pass the American Health Care Act of 2017, which would have hurt millions of Americans while benefiting the pharmaceutical industry, among others. However, he was successful in signing into law a new tax bill that lowered the corporate tax rate by 14 percent, allowing pharmaceutical companies, including those with ties to the Trump administration, to save a total of $76 billion.<a href="#f75" tooltip=""><sup>75</sup></a> After the tax law was enacted, Eli Lilly received a tax cut of nearly $4.5 billion on offshore profits.<a href="#f76" tooltip=""><sup>76</sup></a> Instead of using these tax savings to lower drug prices, big pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly together used $45 billion of their total tax savings<a href="#f77" tooltip=""><sup>77</sup></a> to benefit shareholders via stock buyback programs. After President Trump helped Eli Lilly save billions, Azar, the company’s top executive, was confirmed to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services<a href="#f78" tooltip=""><sup>78</sup></a> at the beginning of the following year.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Although the Trump administration keeps promising to lower drug prices, drug costs continue to climb as Americans suffer and pharmaceutical companies profit and their CEOs line their pockets. The government-funded research and major tax benefits that these pharmaceutical companies enjoy help them stay profitable. Meanwhile, they continue to hike up the costs of drugs, particularly life-sustaining drugs such as insulin.</p>
<p>Big Pharma can play this game indefinitely, benefiting from this culture of corruption, using allies in the administration and in Congress to grow their profit margins while everyday people suffer. But there are steps lawmakers can take to reduce the influence of special interests, including Big Pharma.<a href="#f79" tooltip=""><sup>79</sup></a> For example, lobbyists are currently allowed to fundraise for candidates for federal office—and many of them provide far more financial support beyond the $2,800 per candidate limit by hosting fundraising events and bundling contributions. Banning lobbyists from fundraising<a href="#f80" tooltip=""><sup>80</sup></a> for candidates would reduce special-interest influence over the legislative process. Another way to limit corrupting conflicts of interest is to ban members of Congress from accepting campaign donations from entities under the jurisdiction of the committees on which the serve. It is understood that conflicts can easily arise from committee contributions, which explains why 88 percent of voters support this prohibition.<a href="#f81" tooltip=""><sup>81</sup></a> Additionally, Washington’s infamous revolving door between private industry and government must be closed. Proposals to do so include a lifetime lobbying ban on members of Congress and a five-year lobbying ban on senior congressional staffers.<a href="#f82" tooltip=""><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>As Americans are caught trying to decide whether to pay for rent or medicine, pharmaceutical companies continue to reap government benefits.&nbsp;Reducing drug prices and the costs that everyday people must pay is not possible without fixing the broken system in Washington.</p>

		<p>If you used Macs before Sierra, chances are that you were happy to browse their logs when necessary, for example to check whether your Time Machine backups were working correctly, or quietly throwing errors. At that time, the logs were traditional text-based records like those in other variants of Unix, and browsed using the Console app in /Applications/Utilities.</p>

<p>I started to become irritated by them as long ago as El Capitan, writing:<br>
“Having excised most of the old dross and accumulated extensions, and running a fairly clean El Capitan system, my All Messages [in Console] clocks up around 4000 messages every 8 or 9 hours. At its worst – straight after the OS X 10.11.5 update, for example – it can fill those 4000 message slots in a minute or two, but even overnight when the system is not asleep it will seldom stretch to much longer than 12 hours. A traditional Unix wizard would have the screaming ab-dabs at this. We used to tweak, tune, and pare down systems until they barely coughed into their logs. It used to be the mark of a well-loved system.”</p>
<p>Little did we realise then that Sierra was going to change all that, and by Mojave we’d be enduring 4,000 and more log entries in a second, when our Macs were feeling loquacious. That was because Apple introduced the Unified log, with its entries written not in plain text but compressed binary format. This was the death-blow for the casual reader of logs: for a start, the replacement Console app was unable to access any log entries made in the past, and its tools were, and remain, woefully inadequate for tackling the increasing torrent of log entries.</p>
<p>Despite its many great strengths, the Unified log has suffered two problems that are limiting its usefulness in Sonoma: its diminishing period of coverage, and censorship.</p>
<h4>Period of coverage</h4>
<p>Rather than rolling its log files by their age, and keeping the last five days of logs, macOS maintains them by size. Like its predecessors, that means <code>logd</code>, its maintainer, only keeps the last 520 MB or so of regular <em>Persist</em> log entries collected at any time, and purges older entries. Some older log entries are retained, but it’s pot luck as to whether those you’re interested in are among them, and even if they are, other related entries may have been removed already. If you’re interested to see how this works, <code>logd</code> keeps records in the logdata.statistics.[n].txt files in /var/db/diagnostics, but those too are purged so you can only look back a few days.</p>
<p>In the early days of the Unified log, I was amazed to discover that it kept log records for as long as 20 days or more. In Sonoma, my main working Mac is struggling to keep them for as long as 24 hours. There’s no way for the user to increase that period to compensate for the increased rate of writing log entries by macOS. If I don’t catch an event well within 24 hours of it happening, chances are that its log entries will already have been purged when I go to look for them.</p>
<h4>Privacy</h4>
<p>Censorship to maintain privacy is an important feature in the Unified log, and is responsible for so many of its entries being peppered with <code>&lt;private&gt;</code> instead of revealing potentially sensitive data. The mechanism for this is robust: when collecting entries for the log, sensitive content is excluded, then displayed with that marker. As that sensitive content isn’t stored in the first place, there’s no way to unmask that content once it has been collected and written to the log.</p>
<p>Currently, the only way to see unmasked log entries is through a <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2023/03/08/removing-privacy-censorship-from-the-log/">special profile</a>. Once that has been enabled, and until it’s disabled again, all privacy should be removed from the log, and those <code>&lt;private&gt;</code> markers replaced with real data.</p>
<p>Only Apple has now decided that some log content is too private to reveal even when privacy has been removed. I came across this recently, in multiple log entries, when researching Web Apps, in entries like<br>
<code>ShareKit Start performing service <code>&lt;private&gt;</code> with items: <code>&lt;private&gt;</code><br>
ShareKit filteredItemsFromItems:<code>&lt;private&gt;</code> [-1]--&gt; <code>&lt;private&gt;</code><br>
ShareKit Final shared items for <code>&lt;private&gt;</code>: <code>&lt;private&gt;</code><br>
ShareKit Perform custom action (<code>&lt;private&gt;</code> [<code>&lt;private&gt;</code>])<br>
ShareKit Custom action (<code>&lt;private&gt;</code>) does not support async, running sync block</code></p>
<p>Of course, it may be possible to turn this additional privacy off, but the documentation leads us once again to a guessing game. Apple documents the <em>Enable-Private-Data</em> profile key <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/systemlogging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, where it refers to it controlling “private data logging”. But in its account on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/oslogprivacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">log privacy settings</a>, Apple refers to two distinct privacy settings that can be applied to the content of log entries: the “standard option” <em>‘private’,</em> and <em>sensitive,</em> described as “the option to always redact interpolated values that contain sensitive information.” Does this mean that setting <em>Enable-Private-Data</em> to <strong>false</strong> doesn’t unmask content designated <em>sensitive,</em> only that set as <em>‘private’?</em></p>
<p>Like so many great ideas, the Unified log is suffering from profligate overuse. Who really needs to see full dictionary dumps from RunningBoard? Is there no better way to record that information than in the log?</p>

<p><em><span>“</span>Well, Congressman, I view our responsibility as not just building services that people like to use, but making sure that those services are also good for people and good for society overall.” — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/11/transcript-of-zuckerbergs-appearance-before-house-committee/">Mark Zuckerberg, 2018</a></em></p>
<p>In the previous two posts in this series, I did a <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-i-the-setup">long but briskly paced early history</a> of Meta and the internet in Myanmar—and the hateful and dehumanizing speech that came with it—and then looked at what an outside-the-company view could reveal about <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-ii-the-crisis">Meta’s role in the genocide of the Rohingya</a> in 2016 and 2017.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll look at what two whistleblowers and a crucial newspaper investigation reveal about what was happening <em>inside</em> Meta at the time. Specifically, the disclosed information:</p>
<ul>
<li>gives us a quantitative view of Meta’s content moderation performance—which, in turn, highlights a deceptive <span>PR</span> move routine Meta uses when questioned about moderation;</li>
<li>clarifies what Meta knew about the effects of its algorithmic recommendations systems; and</li>
<li>reveals a parasitic takeover of the Facebook platform by covert influence campaigns around the world—including in Myanmar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we get into that, a brief personal note. There are few ways to be in the world that I enjoy less than<span></span> <span>“</span>breathless conspiratorial.” That rhetorical mode muddies the water when people most need clarity and generates an emotional charge that works against effective decision-making. I really don’t like it. So it’s been unnerving to synthesize a lot of mostly public information and come up with results that wouldn’t look completely out of place in one of those overwrought threads.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to <em>do</em> with that except to be forthright but not dramatic, and to treat my readers’ endocrine systems with respect by avoiding needless flourishes. But the story is just rough and many people in it do bad things. (You can read my <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-meta">meta-post about terminology and sourcing</a> if you want to see me agonize over the minutiae.)</p>
<p><strong>Content warnings for the post:</strong> The whole series is about genocide and hate speech. There are no graphic descriptions or images, and this post includes no slurs or specific examples of hateful and inciting messages, but still. (And there’s a fairly unpleasant photograph of a spider at about the 40% mark.)</p>
<h2 id="the-disclosures">The disclosures</h2>
<p>When Frances Haugen, a former product manager on Meta’s Civic Integrity team, disclosed a ton of internal Meta docs to the SEC—and several media outlets—in 2021, I didn’t really pay attention. I was pandemic-tired and I didn’t think there’d be much in there that I didn’t know. I was wrong!</p>
<p>Frances Haugen’s disclosures are of generational importance, especially if you’re willing to dig down past the US-centric headlines. Haugen has stated that she came forward because of things outside the <span>US—</span><a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1505967624412356612.html">Myanmar</a> and its horrific echo years later in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/business/frances-haugen-facebook.html">Ethiopia</a>, specifically, and the likelihood that it would all just keep happening. So it makes sense that the docs she disclosed would be highly relevant, which they are.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://facebookpapers.com/sec-documents/">eight disclosures</a> in the bundle of information Haugen delivered via lawyers to the <span>SEC</span>, and each is about one specific way Meta<span></span> <span>“</span>misled investors and the public.” Each disclosure takes the form of a letter (which probably has a special legal name I don’t know) and a huge stack of primary documents. The majority of those documents—internal posts, memos, emails, comments—haven’t yet been made public, but the letters themselves include excerpts, and <a href="https://facebookpapers.wpengine.com/">subsequent media coverage</a> and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/facebook-papers-how-to-read-1848702919">straightforward doc dumps</a> have revealed a little bit more. When I cite the disclosures, I’ll point to the place where you can read the longest chunk of primary text—often that’s just the little excerpts in the letters, but sometimes we have a whole—albeit redacted—document to look at.</p>

<p>Before continuing, I think it’s only fair to note that the disclosures we see in public are necessarily those that run counter to Meta’s public statements, because otherwise there would be no need to disclose them. And because we’re only getting excerpts, there’s obviously a ton of context missing—including, presumably, dissenting internal views. I’m not interested in making a handwavey case based on one or two people inside a company making wild statements. So I’m only emphasizing points that are supported in multiple, specific excerpts.</p>
<p>Let’s start with content moderation and what the disclosures have to say about it.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-dangerous-stuff-gets-taken-down">How much dangerous stuff gets taken down?</h2>
<p>We don’t know how much<span></span> <span>“</span>objectionable content” is actually on Facebook—or on Instagram, or Twitter, or any other big platform. The companies running those platforms don’t know the exact numbers either, but what they do have are reasonably accurate <em>estimates</em>. We know they have estimates because sampling and human-powered data classification is how you train the <span>AI</span> classifiers required to do content-based moderation—removing posts and comments—at mass scale. And that process necessarily lets you estimate from your samples roughly how much of a given kind of problem you’re seeing. (This is pretty common knowledge, but it’s also confirmed in an internal doc I quote below.)</p>
<p>The platforms aren’t sharing those estimates with us because no one’s forcing them to. And probably also because, based on what we’ve seen from the disclosures, the numbers are <em>quite bad</em>. So I want to look at how bad they are, or recently were, on Facebook. Alongside that, I want to point out the most common way Meta distracts reporters and governing bodies from its terrible stats, because I think it’s a very useful thing to be able to spot.</p>
<p>One of Frances Haugen’s <span>SEC</span> disclosure letters is about Meta’s failures to moderate hate speech. It’s helpfully titled,<span></span> <span>“</span><a href="https://facebookpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Hate-speech_Redacted.pdf">Facebook misled investors and the public about<span></span> <span>‘</span>transparency’ reports boasting proactive removal of over 90% of identified hate speech when internal records show that<span></span> <span>‘</span>as little as 3-5% of hate’ speech is actually removed</a>.”<a href="#footnote-1UCM" id="ref-1UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Here’s the excerpt from the internal Meta document from which that<span></span> <span>“</span>3–5%” figure is drawn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…we’re deleting less than 5% of all of the hate speech posted to Facebook. This is actually an optimistic estimate—previous (and more rigorous) iterations of this estimation exercise have put it closer to 3%, and on V&amp;I [violence and incitement] we’re deleting somewhere around 0.6%…we miss 95% of violating hate speech.<a href="#footnote-2UCM" id="ref-2UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s another quote from different memo excerpted in the same disclosure letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]e do not … have a model that captures even a majority of integrity harms, particularly in sensitive areas … We only take action against approximately 2% of the hate speech on the platform. Recent estimates suggest that unless there is a major change in strategy, it will be very difficult to improve this beyond 10-20% in the short-medium term.<a href="#footnote-3UCM" id="ref-3UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another estimate from a third internal document:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We seem to be having a small impact in many language-country pairs on Hate Speech and Borderline Hate, probably ~3% … We are likely having little (if any) impact on violence.<a href="#footnote-4UCM" id="ref-4UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s a fourth one, specific to a study about Facebook in Afghanistan, which I include to help contextualize the global numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While Hate Speech is consistently ranked as one of the top abuse categories in the Afghanistan market, the action rate for Hate Speech is worryingly low at 0.23 per cent.<a href="#footnote-5UCM" id="ref-5UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think these figures need a ton of commentary, honestly. I would agree that removing less than a quarter of a percent of hate speech is indeed<span></span> <span>“</span>worryingly low,” as is removing 0.6% of violence and incitement messages. I think removing even 5% of hate speech—the highest number cited in the disclosures—is objectively terrible performance, and I think most people outside of the tech industry would agree with that. Which is presumably why Meta has put a <em>ton</em> of work into muddying the waters around content moderation.</p>
<p>So back to that <span>SEC</span> letter with the long name. It points something out, which is that Meta has long claimed that Facebook<span></span> <span>“</span>proactively” detects between <strong>95%</strong> (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/19/936706748/facebook-says-its-doing-a-better-job-of-catching-hate-speech-before-users-see-it">in 2020, globally</a>) and <strong>98%</strong> (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-socialmedia-insight-idAFKBN2HM3BU">in Myanmar, in 2021</a>) of all the posts it removes because they’re hate speech—before users even see them.</p>
<p>At a glance, this looks good. Ninety-five percent is a lot! But since we know from the disclosed material that based on internal estimates the takedown rates for hate speech are at or below 5%, what’s going on here?</p>
<p>Here’s what Meta is actually saying: Sure, they might identify and remove only a tiny fraction of dangerous and hateful speech on Facebook, but <em>of that tiny fraction</em>, their <span>AI</span> classifiers catch about 95–98% before users report it. That’s literally the whole game, here.</p>
<p>So…the most generous number from the disclosed memos has Meta removing <strong>5% of hate speech on Facebook</strong>. That would mean that for every <strong>2,000</strong> hateful posts or comments, Meta removes about <strong>100–95</strong> automatically and <strong>5</strong> via user reports. In this example, 1,900 of the original 2,000 messages remain up and circulating. So based on the generous 5% removal rate, their <span>AI</span> systems nailed…4.75% of hate speech. That’s the level of performance they’re bragging about.</p>
<p>You don’t need to take my word for any of this—<cite>Wired</cite> <a href="https://erinkissane.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-deceptive-math-when-it-comes-to-hate-speech/%E2%80%9D">ran a critique</a> breaking it down in 2021 and Ranking Digital Rights has <a href="https://erinkissane.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://rankingdigitalrights.org/2021/10/14/cross-checking-facebook-frances-haugen/%E2%80%9D">a strongly worded post</a> about what Meta claims in public vs.&nbsp;what the leaked documents reveal to be true, including this content moderation math runaround.</p>
<p>Meta does this particular routine <em>all the time</em>.</p>
<h2 id="the-shell-game">The shell game</h2>
<p>Here’s Mark Zuckerberg on April 10th, 2018, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/10/transcript-of-mark-zuckerbergs-senate-hearing/">answering a question in front of the Senate’s Commerce and Judiciary committees</a>. He says that hate speech is really hard to find automatically and then pivots to something that he says is a real success, which is<span></span> <span>“</span>terrorist propaganda,” which he simplifies immediately to<span></span> <span>“</span><span>ISIS</span> and Al Qaida content.” But that stuff? No problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contrast [hate speech], for example, with an area like finding terrorist propaganda, which we’ve actually been very successful at deploying A.I. tools on already. Today, as we sit here, 99 percent of the <span>ISIS</span> and Al Qaida content that we take down on Facebook, our A.I. systems flag before any human sees it. So that’s a success in terms of rolling out A.I. tools that can proactively police and enforce safety across the community.<a href="#footnote-6UCM" id="ref-6UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that’s 99% of…the unknown percentage of this kind of content that’s actually removed.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg actually <em>tries</em> to do the same thing the next day, April 11th, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/11/transcript-of-zuckerbergs-appearance-before-house-committee/">before the House Energy and Commerce Committee</a>, but he whiffs the maneuver:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…we’re getting good in certain areas. One of the areas that I mentioned earlier was terrorist content, for example, where we now have A.I. systems that can identify and—and take down 99 percent of the al-Qaeda and ISIS-related content in our system before someone—a human even flags it to us. I think we need to do more of that.<a href="#footnote-7UCM" id="ref-7UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The version Zuckerberg says right there, on April 11th, is what I’m pretty sure most people think Meta means when they go into this stuff—but as stated, it’s a lie.</p>
<p>No one in those hearings presses Zuckerberg on those numbers—and when Meta repeats the move in 2020, plenty of reporters fall into the trap and make untrue claims favorable to Meta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…between its <span>AI</span> systems and its human content moderators, Facebook says it’s detecting and removing 95% of hate content before anyone sees it. —<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90577901/facebook-says-its-deleting-95-of-hate-speech-before-anyone-sees-it">Fast Company</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>About 95 percent of hate speech on Facebook gets caught by algorithms before anyone can report it… —<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/11/facebook-touts-enforcement-amid-investigations-moderator-complaints/">Ars Technica</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook said it took action on 22.1 million pieces of hate speech content to its platform globally last quarter and about 6.5 million pieces of hate speech content on Instagram. On both platforms, it says about 95% of that hate speech was proactively identified and stopped by artificial intelligence. —<a href="https://www.axios.com/2020/11/19/facebook-instagram-hate-speech-metric">Axios</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The company said it now finds and eliminates about 95% of the hate speech violations using automated software systems before a user ever reports them… —<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-11/facebook-pulls-22-5-million-hate-speech-posts-in-second-quarter?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all not just wrong but <em>wildly wrong</em> if you have the internal numbers in front of you.</p>
<p>I’m hitting this point so hard not because I want to point out ~corporate hypocrisy~ or whatever, but because this deceptive runaround is consequential for two reasons: The first is that it provides instructive context about how to interpret Meta’s public statements. The second is that it actually says extremely dire things about Meta’s only hope for content-based moderation at scale, which is their AI-based classifiers.</p>
<p>Here’s Zuckerberg saying as much to a congressional committee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…one thing that I think is important to understand overall is just the sheer volume of content on Facebook makes it so that we can’t—no amount of people that we can hire will be enough to review all of the content.…&nbsp;We need to rely on and build sophisticated A.I. tools that can help us flag certain content.<a href="#footnote-8UCM" id="ref-8UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement is kinda disingenuous in a couple of ways, but the central point is true: the scale of these platforms makes human review incredibly difficult. And Meta’s reasonable-sounding explanation is that this means they have to focus on <span>AI</span>. But by their own internal estimates, Meta’s <span>AI</span> classifiers are only identifying something in the range of 4.75% of hate speech on Facebook, and often considerably less. That seems like a dire stat for the thing you’re putting forward to Congress as your best hope!</p>
<p>The same disclosed internal memo that told us Meta was deleting between 3% and 5% of hate speech had this to say about the potential of <span>AI</span> classifiers to handle mass-scale content removals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[O]ur current approach of grabbing a hundred thousand pieces of content, paying people to label them as Hate or Not Hate, training a classifier, and using it to automatically delete content at 95% precision is just never going to make much of a dent.<a href="#footnote-9UCM" id="ref-9UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting content moderation to work for even extreme and widely reviled categories of speech is obviously genuinely difficult, so I want to be extra clear about a foundational piece of my argument.</p>
<h2 id="responsibility-for-the-machine">Responsibility for the machine</h2>
<p>I think that if you make a machine and hand it out for free to everyone in the world, you’re at least partially responsible for the harm that the machine does.</p>

<p>Also, even if you say,<span></span> <span>“</span>but it’s very difficult to make the machine safer!” I don’t think that reduces your responsibility so much as it makes you look shortsighted and bad at machines.</p>
<p>Beyond the bare fact of difficulty, though, I think the more <em>what harm the machine does</em> deviates from <em>what people might expect a machine that looks like this to do</em>, the more responsibility you bear: If you offer everyone in the world a grenade, I think that’s bad, but also it won’t be surprising when people who take the grenade get hurt or hurt someone else. But when you offer everyone a cute little robot assistant that turns out to be easily repurposed as a rocket launcher, I think that falls into another category.</p>
<p>Especially if you see that people are using your cute little robot assistant to murder thousands of people and elect not to disarm it because that would make it a little less cute.</p>
<p>This brings us to the algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="core-product-mechanics"><span>“</span>Core product mechanics”</h2>
<p><img src="https://erinkissane.com/_files/chalkboard.png" alt="Screencap of an internal Meta document titled Facebook and responsibility, with a header image of the Bart Simson writing on the chalkboard meme in which the writing on the board reads, Facebook is responsible for ranking and recommendations!"></p><p>
<i>From a screencapped version of<span></span> <span>“</span>Facebook and responsibility,” one of the disclosed internal documents.</i>
</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-ii-the-crisis">second post in this series</a>, I quoted people in Myanmar who were trying to cope with an overwhelming flood of hateful and violence-inciting messages. It felt obvious on the ground that the worst, most dangerous posts were getting the most juice.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Haugen disclosures, we can confirm that this was also understood inside Meta.</p>

<p>In 2019, a Meta employee wrote a memo called<span></span> <span>“</span>What is Collateral damage.” It included these statements (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“</span>We have evidence from a variety of sources that hate speech, divisive political speech, and misinformation on Facebook and the family of apps are affecting societies around the world. We also have compelling evidence that <em>our core product mechanics, such as virality, recommendations, and optimizing for engagement, are a significant part of why these types of speech flourish</em> on the platform.</p>
<p>If integrity takes a hands-off stance for these problems, whether for technical (precision) or philosophical reasons, then the net result is that Facebook, taken as a whole, will be actively (if not necessarily consciously) promoting these types of activities. <em>The mechanics of our platform are not neutral.</em> <a href="#footnote-10UCM" id="ref-10UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you work in tech or if you’ve been following mainstream press accounts about Meta over the years, you presumably already know this, but I think it’s useful to establish this piece of the internal conversation.</p>
<p>Here’s a long breakdown from 2020 about the specific parts of the platform that actively put<span></span> <span>“</span>unconnected content”—messages that aren’t from friends or Groups people subscribe to—in front of Facebook users. It comes from an internal post called<span></span> <span>“</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21594152-tier2_rank_other_0320">Facebook and responsibility</a><span></span><span>”</span> (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook is most active in delivering content to users on recommendation surfaces like<span></span> <span>“</span>Pages you may like,”<span></span> <span>“</span>Groups you should join,” and suggested videos on Watch. <strong>These are surfaces where Facebook delivers unconnected content. Users don’t opt-in to these experiences by following other users or Pages. Instead, Facebook is actively presenting these experiences…</strong></p>
<p>News Feed ranking is another way Facebook becomes actively involved in these harmful experiences. Of course users also play an active role in determining the content they are connected to through feed, by choosing who to friend and follow. Still, when and whether a user sees a piece of content is also partly determined by the ranking scores our algorithms assign, which are ultimately under our control. This means, according to ethicists, Facebook is always at least partially responsible for any harmful experiences on News Feed.</p>
<p>This doesn’t owe to any flaw with our News Feed ranking system, it’s just inherent to the process of ranking. To rank items in Feed, we assign scores to all the content available to a user and then present the highest-scoring content first. Most feed ranking scores are determined by relevance models. If the content is determined to be an integrity harm, the score is also determined by some additional ranking machinery to demote it lower than it would have appeared given its score. Crucially, all of these algorithms produce a single score; a score Facebook assigns. Thus, there is no such thing as inaction on Feed. We can only choose to take different kinds of actions.<a href="#footnote-11UCM" id="ref-11UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next few quotes will apply directly to <span>US</span> concerns, but they’re clearly broadly applicable to the 90% of Facebook users who are outside the <span>US</span> and Canada, and whose disinfo concerns receive vastly fewer resources.</p>
<p>This one is from an internal Meta doc from November 5, 2020:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not only do we not do something about combustible election misinformation in comments, we amplify them and give them broader distribution.<a href="#footnote-12UCM" id="ref-12UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Meta staff tried to take the measure of their own recommendation systems’ behavior, they found that the systems led a fresh, newly made account into disinfo-infested waters very quickly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a small number of high quality/verified conservative interest follows…&nbsp;within just one day Page recommendations had already devolved towards polarizing content.</p>
<p>Although the account set out to follow conservative political news and humor content generally, and began by following verified/high quality conservative pages, Page recommendations began to include conspiracy recommendations after only 2 days (it took &lt;1 week to get a QAnon recommendation!)</p>
<p>Group recommendations were slightly slower to follow suit - it took 1 week for in-feed <span>GYSJ</span> recommendations to become fully political/right-leaning, and just over 1 week to begin receiving conspiracy recommendations.<a href="#footnote-13UCM" id="ref-13UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same document reveals that several of the Pages and Groups Facebook’s systems recommend to its test user show multiple signs of association with<span></span> <span>“</span>coordinated inauthentic behavior,” aka foreign and domestic covert influence campaigns, which we’ll get to very soon.</p>
<p>Before that, I want to offer just one example of algorithmic malpractice from Myanmar.</p>
<h2 id="flower-speech">Flower speech</h2>
<p><img src="https://erinkissane.com/_files/panzagar.jpg" alt="Panzagar campaign illustration depicting a Burmese girl with thanaka on her cheek and illustrated flowers coming from her mouth, flowing toward speech bubbles labeled with the names of Burmese towns and cities."></p>
<p>Back in 2014, Burmese organizations including <span>MIDO</span> and Yangon-based tech accelerator Phandeeyar collaborated on a carefully calibrated <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/in-person/hate-speech-pours-poison-heart.html">counter-speech project called Panzagar (<em>flower speech</em>)</a>. The campaign—which was designed to be delivered in person, in printed materials, and online—encouraged ordinary Burmese citizens to push back on hate speech in Myanmar.</p>
<p>Later that year, Meta, which had just been implicated in the deadly communal violence in Mandalay, joined with the Burmese orgs to turn their imagery into digital Facebook stickers that users could apply to posts calling for things like the annihilation of the Rohingya people. The stickers depict cute cartoon characters, several of which offer admonishments like,<span></span> <span>“</span>Don’t be the source of a fire,”<span></span> <span>“</span>Think before you share,”<span></span> <span>“</span>Don’t you be spawning hate,” and<span></span> <span>“</span>Let it go buddy!”</p>
<p>The campaign was widely and approvingly covered by <a href="https://beautifultrouble.org/toolbox/tool/flower-speech-campaign/">western organizations</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/using-flower-speech-and-new-facebook-tools-myanmar-fights-online-hate-speech/2014/12/24/3bff458c-8ba9-11e4-ace9-47de1af4c3eb_story.html">media outlets</a>, and Meta got a lot of praise for its involvement.</p>
<p>But according to members of the Burmese civil society coalition behind the campaign, it turned out that the Panzagar Facebook stickers—which were explicitly designed as counterspeech—“carried significant weight in their distribution algorithm,” so <em>anyone who used them to counter hateful and violent messages inadvertently helped those messages gain wider distribution</em>.<a href="#footnote-14UCM" id="ref-14UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>I mention the Panzagar incident not only because it’s such a head-smacking example of Meta favoring cosmetic, PR-friendly tweaks over meaningful redress, or because it reveals plain incompetence in the face of already-serious violence, but also because it gets to what I see as a genuinely foundational problem with Meta in Myanmar.</p>
<p>Even when the company was finally (repeatedly) forced to take notice of the dangers it was contributing to, actions that could actually have made a difference—like rolling out new programs only after local consultation and adaptation, scaling up culturally and linguistically competent human moderation teams in tandem with increasing uptake, and above all, <em>altering the design of the product</em> to stop amplifying the most charged messages—remained not just undone, but <em>unthinkable</em> because they were outside the company’s understanding of what the product’s design should take into consideration.</p>
<p>This refusal to connect core project design with accelerating global safety problems means that attempts at prevention and repair are relegated to window-dressing—or which are actually counterproductive, as in the case of the Panzagar stickers, which absorbed the energy and efforts of local Burmese civil society groups and turned them into something that made the situation <em>worse</em>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/interview/alex-stamos/">2018 interview with Frontline about problems with Facebook</a>, Meta’s former Chief Security Officer, Alex Stamos, returns again and again to the idea that security work properly happens at the product design level. Toward the end of the interview, he gets very clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stamos: I think there was a structural problem here in that the people who were dealing with the downsides were all working together over kind of in the corner, right, so you had the safety and security teams, tight-knit teams that deal with all the bad outcomes, and we didn’t really have a relationship with the people who are actually designing the product.</p>
<p>Interviewer: You did not have a relationship?</p>
<p>Stamos: Not like we should have, right? It became clear—one of the things that became very clear after the election was that the problems that we knew about and were dealing with before were not making it back into how these products are designed and implemented.<a href="#footnote-15UCM" id="ref-15UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meta’s content moderation was a disaster in Myanmar—and around the world—not only because it was treated and staffed like an afterthought, but because it was <em>competing against Facebook’s core machinery</em>.</p>
<p>And just as the house always wins, the core machinery of a mass-scale product built to boost engagement always defeats retroactive and peripheral attempts at cleanup.</p>
<p>This is especially true once organized commercial and nation-state actors figured out how to take over that machinery with large-scale fake Page networks boosted by fake engagement, which brings us to a less-discussed revelation: By the mid-2010s, Facebook had effectively become the equivalent of botnet in the hands of any group, governmental or commercial, who could summon the will and resources to exploit it.</p>
<p>A lot of people did, including, predictably, some of the worst people in the world.</p>

<p>In 2018, the <em>New York Times</em> published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html?unlocked_article_code=KARVJapYvl1Y6L1cieWmNoOFxPgEAC2ZMHtfiZ7BsjuB4MSBfeTmmw8qAgf_LqJHnCEapaMqECHmO3q7kvvtYwii2910C_u_Kg-_EbNKEiyYglifgsfqSOQjuBB7jIpIGMYoG6yhsVeZ870Qc4PGIb0GNsypqYsMOY73_yzGrn79cFHQfEzvYPBJATppRHCHK-qy3gOmuLY0Tw_NmiDBDrF9veQ5xyjMCtfYXjNOJ1IbzxXuzCFUPMwscGe1WwM8-g_f-Byy-zbYVnSYx_wTJYPcCcrp7KppFt6NpxbBbVHLO0e-2gd2LKxotalTNVYGXiHq2mJYNaVhoDJaixTf6GADI3oUnA&amp;smid=url-share">a front-page account</a> of what really happened on Facebook in Myanmar, which is that beginning around 2013, Myanmar’s military, the Tatmadaw, set up a dedicated, ultra-secret anti-Rohingya hatefarm spread across military bases in which up to 700 staffers worked in shifts <strong>to manufacture the appearance of overwhelming support for the genocide the same military then carried out</strong>.<a href="#footnote-16UCM" id="ref-16UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>When the <em><span>NYT</span></em> did their investigation in 2018, all those fake Pages were still up.</p>
<p>Here’s how it worked: First, the military set up a sprawling network of fake accounts and Pages on Facebook. The fake accounts and Pages focused on innocuous subjects like beauty, entertainment, and humor. These Pages were called things like,<span></span> <span>“</span>Beauty and Classic,”<span></span> <span>“</span>Down for Anything,”<span></span> <span>“</span>You Female Teachers,”<span></span> <span>“</span>We Love Myanmar,” and<span></span> <span>“</span>Let’s Laugh Casually.” Then military staffers, some trained by Russian propaganda specialists, spent years tending the Pages and gradually building up followers.<a href="#footnote-17UCM" id="ref-17UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Then, using this array of long-nurtured fake Pages—and Groups, and accounts—the Tatmadaw’s propagandists used everything they’d learned about Facebook’s algorithms to post and boost viral messages that cast Rohingya people as part of a global Islamic threat, and as the perpetrators of a never-ending stream of atrocities. The <em>Times</em> reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Troll accounts run by the military helped spread the content, shout down critics and fuel arguments between commenters to rile people up. Often, they posted sham photos of corpses that they said were evidence of Rohingya-perpetrated massacres…<a href="#footnote-18UCM" id="ref-18UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That the Tatmadaw was capable of such a sophisticated operation shouldn’t have come as a surprise. Longtime Myanmar digital rights and technology researcher Victoire Rio notes that the Tatmadaw had been openly sending its officers to study in Russia since 2001, was<span></span> <span>“</span>among the first adopters of the Facebook platform in Myanmar” and launched<span></span> <span>“</span>a dedicated curriculum as part of its Defense Service Academy Information Warfare training.”<a href="#footnote-19UCM" id="ref-19UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="what-these-messages-did">What these messages did</h2>
<p>I don’t have the access required to sort out which specific messages originated from extremist religious networks vs.&nbsp;which were produced by military operations, but I’ve seen a lot of the posts and comments central to these overlapping campaigns in the <span>UN</span> documents and human rights reports.</p>
<p>They do some very specific things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They dehumanize the Rohingya:</strong> The Facebook messages speak of the Rohingya as invasive species that outbreed Buddhists and Myanmar’s <em>real</em> ethnic groups. There are a lot of bestiality images.</li>
<li><strong>They present the Rohingya as inhumane, as sexual predators, and as an immediate threat:</strong> There are a lot of graphic photos of mangled bodies from around the world, most of them presented as Buddhist victims of Muslim killers—usually Rohingya. There are a lot of posts about Rohingya men raping, forcibly marrying, beating, and murdering Buddhist women. One post that got passed around a lot includes a graphic photo of a woman tortured and murdered by a Mexican cartel, presented as a Buddhist woman in Myanmar murdered by the Rohingya.</li>
<li><strong>They connect the Rohingya to the<span></span> <span>“</span>global Islamic threat”:</strong> There’s a lot of equating Rohingya people with <span>ISIS</span> terrorists and assigning them group responsibility for real attacks and atrocities by distant Islamic terror organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, all of these moves flow into demands for violence. The messages call incessantly and graphically for mass killings, beatings, and forced deportations. They call not for punishment, but annihilation.</p>
<p>This is, literally, textbook preparation for genocide, and I want to take a moment to look at how it works.</p>
<p>Helen Fein is the author of several definitive books on genocide, a co-founder and first president of the International Association of Genocide Scholars, and the founder of the Institute for the Study of Genocide. I think her description of the ways genocidaires legitimize their attacks holds up extremely well despite having been published 30 years ago. Here, she classifies a specific kind of rhetoric as one of the defining characteristics of genocide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Is there evidence of an ideology, myth, or an articulated social goal which enjoins or justifies the destruction of the victim? Besides the above, observe religious traditions of contempt and collective defamation, stereotypes, and derogatory metaphor indicating the victim is inferior, subhuman (animals, insects, germs, viruses) or superhuman (Satanic, omnipotent), or other signs that the victims were pre-defined as alien, outside the universe of obligation of the perpetrator, subhuman or dehumanized, or the enemy—i.e., the victim needs to be eliminated in order that we may live (Them or Us).<a href="#footnote-20UCM" id="ref-20UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s also necessary for genocidaires to make claims—often supported by manufactured evidence—that the targeted group itself is the true danger, often by projecting genocidal intent onto the group that will be attacked.</p>
<p>Adam Jones, the guy who wrote a <a href="https://erinkissane.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.routledge.com/Genocide-A-Comprehensive-Introduction/Jones/p/book/9781138823846%E2%80%9D">widely used textbook on genocide</a>, puts it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One justifies genocidal designs by imputing such designs to perceived opponents. The Tutsis/ Croatians/Jews/Bolsheviks must be killed because they harbor intentions to kill us, and will do so if they are not stopped/prevented/annihilated. Before they are killed, they are brutalized, debased, and dehumanized—turning them into something approaching<span></span> <span>“</span>subhumans” or<span></span> <span>“</span>animals” and, by a circular logic, justifying their extermination.<a href="#footnote-21UCM" id="ref-21UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So before their annihilation, the target group is presented as outcast, subhuman, vermin, but also themselves genocidal—a mortal threat. And afterward, the extraordinary cruelties characteristic of genocide reassure those committing the atrocities that their victims aren’t actually people.</p>
<p>The Tatmadaw committed atrocities in Myanmar. I touched on them in <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-ii-the-crisis">Part <span>II</span></a> and I’m not going to detail them here. But the figuratively dehumanizing rhetoric I described in parts one and two can’t be separated from the literally dehumanizing things the Tatmadaw did to the humans they maimed and traumatized and killed. Especially now that it’s clear that the military was behind much of the rhetoric as well as the violent actions that rhetoric worked to justify.</p>
<p>In some cases, even the methods match up: The military’s campaign of intense and systematic sexual violence toward and mutilation of women and girls, combined with the concurrent mass murder of children and babies, feels inextricably connected to the rhetoric that cast the Rohingya as both a sexual and reproductive threat who endanger the safety of Buddhist women and outbreed the ethnicities that <em>belong</em> in Myanmar.</p>
<p>Genocidal communications are an inextricable part of a system that turns<span></span> <span>“</span>ethnic tensions” into mass death. When we see that the Tatmadaw was literally the operator of covert hate and dehumanization propaganda networks on Facebook, I think the most rational way to understand those networks is as <em>an integral part</em> of the genocidal campaign.</p>
<hr>
<p>After the <em>New York Times</em> article went live, Meta did two big takedowns. Nearly four million people were following the fake Pages identified by either the <em><span>NYT</span></em> or by Meta in follow-up investigations. (Meta had previously removed the Tatmadaw’s own official Pages and accounts and 46<span></span> <span>“</span>news and opinion” Pages that turned out to be covertly operated by the military—those Pages were followed by nearly 12 million people.)</p>
<p>So given these revelations and disclosures, here’s my question: Does the deliberate, adversarial use of Facebook by Myanmar’s military as a platform for disinformation and propaganda take any of the heat off of Meta? After all, a sovereign country’s military is a significant adversary.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing—Alex Stamos, Facebook’s Chief Security Officer, had been trying <em>since 2016</em> to get Meta’s management and executives to acknowledge and meaningfully address the fact that Facebook was being used as host for both commercial and state-sponsored covert influence ops around the world. Including in the only place where it was likely to get the company into <em>really</em> hot water: the United States.</p>
<h2 id="oh-fuck"><span>“</span>Oh fuck”</h2>
<p>On December 16, 2016, Facebook’s newish Chief Security Officer, Alex Stamos—who now runs Stanford’s Internet Observatory—rang Meta’s biggest alarm bells by calling an emergency meeting with Mark Zuckerberg and other top-level Meta executives.</p>
<p>In that meeting, documented in Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang’s book, <em>The Ugly Truth</em>, Stamos handed out a summary outlining the Russian capabilities. It read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We assess with moderate to high conﬁdence that Russian state-sponsored actors are using Facebook in an attempt to inﬂuence the broader political discourse via the deliberate spread of questionable news articles, the spread of information from data breaches intended to discredit, and actively engaging with journalists to spread said stolen information.<a href="#footnote-22UCM" id="ref-22UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>“</span>Oh fuck, how did we miss this?” Zuckerberg responded.</p>

<p>Stamos’ team had also uncovered<span></span> <span>“</span>a huge network of false news sites on Facebook” posting and cross-promoting sensationalist bullshit, much of it political disinformation, along with examples of governmental propaganda operations from Indonesia, Turkey, and other nation-state actors. And the team had recommendations on what to do about it.</p>
<p>Frenkel and Kang paraphrase Stamos’ message to Zuckerberg (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook needed to go on the oﬀensive. It should no longer merely monitor and analyze cyber operations; the company had to gear up for battle. But to do so required <strong>a radical change in culture and structure</strong>. Russia’s incursions were missed because departments across Facebook hadn’t communicated and because no one had taken the time to think like Vladimir Putin.<a href="#footnote-23UCM" id="ref-23UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those changes in culture and structure didn’t happen. Stamos began to realize that to Meta’s executives, his work uncovering the foreign influence networks, and his choice to bring them to the executives’ attention, were both unwelcome and deeply inconvenient.</p>
<p>All through the spring and summer of 2017, instead of retooling to fight the massive international <em>category</em> of abuse Stamos and his colleagues had uncovered, Facebook played hot potato with the information about the ops Russia had already run.</p>
<p>On September 21, 2017, while the Tatmadaw’s genocidal<span></span> <span>“</span>clearance operations” were approaching their completion, Mark Zuckerberg finally spoke publicly about the Russian influence campaign for the first time.<a href="#footnote-24UCM" id="ref-24UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In the intervening months, the massive covert influence networks operating in Myanmar ground along, unnoticed.</p>
<p>Thanks to Sophie Zhang, a data scientist who spent two years at Facebook fighting to get networks like the Tatmadaw’s removed, we know quite a lot about why.</p>
<h2 id="what-sophie-zhang-found">What Sophie Zhang found</h2>
<p>In 2018, Facebook hired a data scientist named Sophie Zhang and assigned her to a new team working on fake engagement—and specifically on<span></span> <span>“</span>scripted inauthentic activity,” or bot-driven fake likes and shares.</p>
<p>Within her first year on the team, Zhang began finding examples of bot-driven engagement being used for political messages in both Brazil and India ahead of their national elections. Then she found something that concerned her a lot more. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/29/1030260/facebook-whistleblower-sophie-zhang-global-political-manipulation/">Karen Hao of the <span>MIT</span> Technology Review writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The administrator for the Facebook page of the Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernández, had created hundreds of pages with fake names and profile pictures to look just like users—and was using them to flood the president’s posts with likes, comments, and shares. (Facebook bars users from making multiple profiles but doesn’t apply the same restriction to pages, which are usually meant for businesses and public figures.)</p>
<p>The activity didn’t count as scripted, but the effect was the same. Not only could it mislead the casual observer into believing Hernández was more well-liked and popular than he was, but it was also boosting his posts higher up in people’s newsfeeds. For a politician whose 2017 reelection victory was widely believed to be fraudulent, the brazenness—and implications—were alarming.<a href="#footnote-25UCM" id="ref-25UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Zhang brought her discovery back to the teams working on Pages Integrity and News Feed Integrity, both refused to act, either to stop fake Pages from being created, or to keep the fake engagement signals the fake Pages generate from making posts go viral.</p>
<p>But Zhang kept at it, and after a year, Meta finally removed the Honduran network. The very next day, Zhang reported a network of fake Pages in Albania. <em>The Guardian</em><span></span><span>’</span>s Julia Carrie Wong <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/12/facebook-fake-engagement-whistleblower-sophie-zhang">explains what came next</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In August, she discovered and filed escalations for suspicious networks in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, Mexico, Argentina and Italy. Throughout the autumn and winter she added networks in the Philippines, Afghanistan, South Korea, Bolivia, Ecuador, Iraq, Tunisia, Turkey, Taiwan, Paraguay, El Salvador, India, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Ukraine, Poland and Mongolia.<a href="#footnote-26UCM" id="ref-26UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Zhang, Meta eventually established a policy against<span></span> <span>“</span>inauthentic behavior,” but didn’t enforce it, and rejected Zhang’s proposal to punish repeat fake-Page creators by banning their personal accounts because of policy staff’s<span></span> <span>“</span>discomfort with taking action against people connected to high-profile accounts.”<a href="#footnote-27UCM" id="ref-27UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Zhang discovered that even when she took initiative to track down covert influence campaigns, the teams who <em>could</em> take action to remove them didn’t—not without persistent<span></span> <span>“</span>lobbying.” So Zhang tried harder. Here’s Karen Hao again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She was called upon repeatedly to help handle emergencies and praised for her work, which she was told was valued and important.</p>
<p>But despite her repeated attempts to push for more resources, leadership cited different priorities. They also dismissed Zhang’s suggestions for a more sustainable solution, such as suspending or otherwise penalizing politicians who were repeat offenders. It left her to face a never-ending firehose: The manipulation networks she took down quickly came back, often only hours or days later.<span></span> <span>“</span>It increasingly felt like I was trying to empty the ocean with a colander,” she says.<a href="#footnote-28UCM" id="ref-28UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Julia Carrie Wong’s Guardian piece reveals something interesting about Zhang’s reporting chain, which is that Meta’s Vice President of Integrity, Guy Rosen, was one of the people giving her the hardest pushback.</p>
<p>Remember Internet.org, also known as Free Basics, aka Meta’s push to dominate global internet use in all those countries it would go on to<span></span> <span>“</span>deprioritize” and generally ignore?</p>
<p>Guy Rosen, Meta’s then-newish <span>VP</span> of Integrity, <em>is the guy who previously ran Internet.org</em>. He came to lead Integrity directly from being <span>VP</span> of <em>Growth</em>. Before getting acquihired by Meta, Rosen co-founded a company <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-guy-at-the-center-of-facebooks-misinformation-mess">The Information describes</a> as<span></span> <span>“</span>a startup that analyzed what people did on their smartphones.”<a href="#footnote-29UCM" id="ref-29UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Meta bought that startup in 2013, nominally because it would help Internet.org. In a very on-the-nose development, Rosen’s company’s supposedly privacy-protecting <span>VPN</span> software allowed Meta to collect huge amounts of data—so much that Apple booted the app from its store.</p>
<p>So that’s Facebook’s <span>VP</span> of Integrity.</p>
<h2 id="we-simply-didnt-care-enough-to-stop-them"><span>“</span>We simply didn’t care enough to stop them”</h2>
<p>In the <em>Guardian</em>, Julia Carrie Wong reports that in the fall of 2019, Zhang discovered that the Honduras network was back up, and she couldn’t get Meta’s Threat Intelligence team to deal with it. That December, she posted an internal memo about it. Rosen responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook had<span></span> <span>“</span>moved slower than we’d like because of prioritization” on the Honduras case, Rosen wrote.<span></span> <span>“</span>It’s a bummer that it’s back and I’m excited to learn from this and better understand what we need to do systematically,” he added. But he also chastised her for making a public [public as in within Facebook <span>—EK</span>] complaint, saying:<span></span> <span>“</span>My concern is that threads like this can undermine the people that get up in the morning and do their absolute best to try to figure out how to spend the finite time and energy we all have and put their heart and soul into it.”[31]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a private follow-up conversation (still in December, 2019), Zhang alerted Rosen that she’d been told that the Facebook Threat Intelligence team would only prioritize fake networks affecting<span></span> <span>“</span>the US/western Europe and foreign adversaries such as Russia/Iran/etc.”</p>
<p>Rosen told her that he agreed with those priorities. Zhang pushed back (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I get that the US/western Europe/etc is important, but for a company with effectively unlimited resources, I don’t understand why this cannot get on the roadmap for anyone … A strategic response manager told me that <strong>the world outside the US/Europe was basically like the wild west with me as the part-time dictator in my spare time. He considered that to be a positive development because to his knowledge it wasn’t covered by anyone before</strong> he learned of the work I was doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rosen replied,<span></span> <span>“</span>I wish resources were unlimited.”<a href="#footnote-30UCM" id="ref-30UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>I’ll quote Wong’s next passage in full:<span></span> <span>“</span>At the time, the company was about to&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2020/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2019-Results/default.aspx">report</a>&nbsp;annual operating profits of $23.9bn on $70.7bn in revenue. It had $54.86bn in cash on hand.”</p>
<p>In early 2020, Zhang’s managers told her she was all done tracking down influence networks—it was time she got back to hunting and erasing<span></span> <span>“</span>vanity likes” from bots instead.</p>
<p>But Zhang believed that if she stopped, no one else would hunt down big, potentially consequential covert influence networks. So she kept doing at least some of it, including advocating for action on an inauthentic Azerbaijan network that appeared to be connected to the country’s ruling party. In an internal group, she wrote that,<span></span> <span>“</span>Unfortunately, Facebook has become complicit by inaction in this authoritarian crackdown.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although we conclusively tied this network to elements of the government in early February, and have compiled extensive evidence of its violating nature, the effective decision was made not to prioritize it, effectively turning a blind eye.”<a href="#footnote-31UCM" id="ref-31UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After those messages, Threat Intelligence decided to act on the network after all.</p>
<p>Then Meta fired Zhang for poor performance.</p>
<p>On her way out the door, Zhang posted a long exit memo—7,800 words—describing what she’d seen. Meta deleted it, so Zhang put up a password-protected version on her own website so her colleagues can see it. So Meta got Zhang’s entire website taken down and her domain deactivated. Eventually Meta got enough employee pressure that it put an edited version back up on their internal site.<a href="#footnote-32UCM" id="ref-32UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, someone <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ignore-political-manipulation-whistleblower-memo">leaked the memo to Buzzfeed News</a>.</p>
<p>In the memo, Zhang wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve found multiple blatant attempts by foreign national governments to abuse our platform on vast scales to mislead their own citizenry, and caused international news on multiple occasions. I have personally made decisions that affected national presidents without oversight, and taken action to enforce against so many prominent politicians globally that I’ve lost count.<a href="#footnote-33UCM" id="ref-33UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:<span></span> <span>“</span>[T]he truth was, we simply didn’t care enough to stop them.”</p>
<p>On her final day at Meta, Zhang left notes for her colleagues, tallying suspicious accounts involved in political influence campaigns that needed to be investigated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There were 200 suspicious accounts still boosting a politician in Bolivia, she recorded; 100 in Ecuador, 500 in Brazil, 700 in Ukraine, 1,700 in Iraq, 4,000 in India and more than 10,000 in Mexico.<a href="#footnote-34UCM" id="ref-34UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="with-all-due-respect"><span>“</span>With all due respect”</h2>
<p>Zhang’s work at Facebook happened <em>after</em> the wrangling over Russian influence ops that Alex Stamos’ team found. And <em>after</em> the genocide in Myanmar. And <em>after</em> Mark Zuckerberg did his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/business/facebook-myanmar-zuckerberg.html">press-and-government tour</a> about how hard Meta tried and how much better they’d do after Myanmar.<a href="#footnote-35UCM" id="ref-35UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>It was <em>an entire calendar year</em> after the <em>New York Times</em> found the Tatmadaw’s genocide-fueling fake-Page hatefarm that Guy Rosen, Facebook’s <span>VP</span> of Integrity, told Sophie Zhang that the only coordinated fake networks Facebook would take down were the ones that affected the <span>US</span>, Western Europe, and<span></span> <span>“</span>foreign adversaries.”<a href="#footnote-36UCM" id="ref-36UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>In response to Zhang’s disclosures, Rosen later <a href="https://twitter.com/guyro/status/1305613201803943936">hopped onto Twitter</a> to deliver his personal assessment of the networks Zhang found and couldn’t get removed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With all due respect, what she’s described is fake likes—which we routinely remove using automated detection. Like any team in the industry or government, we prioritize stopping the most urgent and harmful threats globally. Fake likes is not one of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://facebookpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ethnic-violence_Redacted.pdf">One of Frances Haugen’s disclosures</a> includes an internal memo that summarizes Meta’s actual, non-Twitter-snark awareness of the way Facebook has been hollowed out for routine use by covert influence campaigns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We frequently observe highly-coordinated, intentional activity on the <span>FOAS</span> [Family of Apps and Services] by problematic actors, including states, foreign actors, and actors with a record of criminal, violent or hateful behaviour, aimed at promoting social violence, promoting hate, exacerbating ethnic and other societal cleavages, and/or delegitimizing social institutions through misinformation. This is particularly prevalent—and problematic—in At Risk Countries and Contexts.<a href="#footnote-37UCM" id="ref-37UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, they knew.</p>
<p>Because of Haugen’s disclosures, we also know that in 2020, for the category,<span></span> <span>“</span>Remove, reduce, inform/measure misinformation on <span>FB</span> Apps, Includes Community Review and Matching”—so, that’s moderation targeting misinformation specifically—only 13% of the total budget went to the non-US countries that provide more than 90% of Facebook’s user base, and which include <em>all</em> of those At Risk Countries. The other 87% of the budget was reserved for the 10% of Facebook users who live in the United States.<a href="#footnote-38UCM" id="ref-38UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>In case any of this seems disconnected with the main thread of what happened in Myanmar, here’s what (formerly Myanmar-based) researcher Victoire Rio had to say about covert coordinated influence networks in her extremely good <a href="https://toda.org/assets/files/resources/policy-briefs/t-pb-78_victoire-rio_role-of-social-media-in-fomenting-violence-myanmar.pdf">2020 case study about the role of social media in Myanmar’s violence</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bad actors spend months—if not years—building networks of online assets, including accounts, pages and groups, that allow them to manipulate the conversation. These inauthentic presences continue to present a major risk in places like Myanmar and are responsible for the overwhelming majority of problematic content.<a href="#footnote-39UCM" id="ref-39UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that Rio says that these inauthentic networks—the exact things Sophie Zhang chased down until she got fired for it—continued to present a major risk in 2020.</p>
<p>It’s time to skip ahead.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Myanmar in 2021, four years after the peak of the genocide. After everything I’ve dealt with in this whole painfully long series so far, it would be fair to assume that Meta would be prioritizing getting everything right in Myanmar. Especially after the coup.</p>


<p>In 2021, the Tatmadaw deposed Myanmar’s democratically elected government and transferred the leadership of the country to the military’s Commander-in-Chief. Since then, the military has turned the machines of surveillance, administrative repression, torture, and murder that it refined on the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities onto Myanmar’s Buddhist ethnic Bamar majority.</p>
<p><em>Also</em> in 2021, Facebook’s director of policy for <span>APAC</span> Emerging Countries, Rafael Frankel, told the Associated Press that Facebook had now<span></span> <span>“</span>built a dedicated team of over 100 Burmese speakers.”</p>
<p>This<span></span> <span>“</span>dedicated team is,” presumably, the group of contract workers employed by the Accenture-run<span></span> <span>“</span>Project Honey Badger” team in Malaysia.<a href="#footnote-40UCM" id="ref-40UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> (Which, <em>Jesus</em>.)</p>
<p>In October of 2021, the Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-middle-east-religion-europe-a38da3ccd40ffae7e4caa450c374f796">took a look at how that’s working out on Facebook in Myanmar</a>. Right away, they found threatening and violent posts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One 2 1/2 minute&nbsp;video&nbsp;posted on Oct.&nbsp;24 of a supporter of the military calling for violence against opposition groups has garnered over 56,000 views.</p>
<p><span>“</span>So starting from now, we are the god of death for all (of them),” the man says in Burmese while looking into the camera.<span></span> <span>“</span>Come tomorrow and let’s see if you are real men or gays.”</p>
<p>One account posts the home address of a military defector and a photo of his wife. Another post from Oct.&nbsp;29 includes a&nbsp;photo&nbsp;of soldiers leading bound and blindfolded men down a dirt path. The Burmese caption reads,<span></span> <span>“</span>Don’t catch them alive.”<a href="#footnote-41UCM" id="ref-41UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s where content moderation stood in 2021. What about the algorithmic side of things? Is Facebook still boosting dangerous messages in Myanmar?</p>
<p>In the spring of 2021, <a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/digital-threats/algorithm-harm-facebook-amplified-myanmar-military-propaganda-following-coup/">Global Witness analysts made a clean Facebook account with no history</a> and searched for တပ်မ​တော်—“Tatmadaw.” They opened the top page in the results, a military fan page, and found no posts that broke Facebook’s new, stricter rules. Then they hit the<span></span> <span>“</span>like” button, which caused a pop-up with<span></span> <span>“</span>related pages” to appear. Then the team popped open up the first five recommended pages.</p>
<p>Here’s what they found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Three of the five top page recommendations that Facebook’s algorithm suggested contained content posted after the coup that violated Facebook’s policies.</strong>&nbsp; One of the other pages had content that violated Facebook’s community standards but that was posted before the coup and therefore isn’t included in this article.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically, they found messages that included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Incitement to violence</li>
<li>Content that glorifies the suffering or humiliation of others</li>
<li>Misinformation that can lead to physical harm<a href="#footnote-42UCM" id="ref-42UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as several kinds of posts that violated&nbsp;<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/an-update-on-myanmar/">Facebook’s new and more specific policies on Myanmar</a>.</p>
<p>So not only were the violent, violence-promoting posts still showing up in Myanmar four years later after the atrocities in Rakhine State—and after the Tatmadaw turned the full machinery of of its violence onto opposition members of Myanmar’s Buddhist ethnic majority—but <em>Facebook was still funneling users directly into them</em> after even the lightest engagement with anodyne pro-military content.</p>
<p><em>This is in 2021</em>, with Meta throwing vastly more resources at the problem than it ever did during the period leading up to and including the genocide of the Rohingya people. Its algorithms are making <em>active recommendations</em> by Facebook, precisely as outlined in the Meta memos in Haugen’s disclosures.</p>
<p>By any reasonable measure, I think this is a failure.</p>
<p>Meta didn’t respond to requests for comment from Global Witness, but when the <em>Guardian</em> and <span>AP</span> picked up the story, Meta got back to <em>them</em> with…this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our teams continue to closely monitor the situation in Myanmar in real-time and take action on any posts, Pages or Groups that break our rules. <strong>We proactively detect 99 percent of the hate speech removed from Facebook in Myanmar</strong>, and our ban of the Tatmadaw and repeated disruption of coordinated inauthentic behavior has made it harder for people to misuse our services to spread harm.<a href="#footnote-43UCM" id="ref-43UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One more time: This statement <strong>says nothing about how much hate speech is removed</strong>. It’s pure misdirection.</p>
<hr>
<p>Internal Meta memos highlight ways to use Facebook’s algorithmic machinery to sharply reduce the spread of what they called<span></span> <span>“</span>high-harm misinfo.” For those potentially harmful topics, you<span></span> <span>“</span>hard demote” (aka<span></span> <span>“</span>push down” or<span></span> <span>“</span>don’t show”) reshared posts that were originally made by someone who isn’t friended or followed by the viewer. (Frances Haugen talks about this in interviews as<span></span> <span>“</span>cutting the reshare chain.”)</p>
<p>And <em>this method works</em>. In Myanmar,<span></span> <span>“</span>reshare depth demotion” reduced<span></span> <span>“</span>viral inflammatory prevalence” by 25% and cut<span></span> <span>“</span>photo misinformation” almost in half.</p>
<p>In a reasonable world, I think Meta would have decided to broaden use of this method and work on refining it to make it even more effective. What they did, though, was decide to roll it back within Myanmar as soon as the upcoming elections were over.<a href="#footnote-44UCM" id="ref-44UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>The same <span>SEC</span> disclosure I just cited also notes that Facebook’s <span>AI</span> <span></span><span>“</span>classifier” for Burmese hate speech didn’t seem to be maintained or in use—and that algorithmic recommendations were still shuttling people toward violent, hateful messages that violated Facebook’s Community Standards.</p>
<p>So that’s how the algorithms were going. How about the military’s covert influence campaign?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-socialmedia-insight-idAFKBN2HM3BU">Reuters reported in late 2021</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Myanmar’s military seeks to put down protest on the streets, a parallel battle is playing out on social media, with the junta using fake accounts to denounce opponents and press its message that it seized power to save the nation from election fraud…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Reuters reporters explain the military has assigned thousands of the soldiers to wage<span></span> <span>“</span>information combat” in what appears to be an expanded, distributed version of their earlier secret propaganda ops:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“</span>Soldiers are asked to create several fake accounts and are given content segments and talking points that they have to post,” said Captain Nyi Thuta, who defected from the army to join rebel forces at the end of February.<span></span> <span>“</span>They also monitor activity online and join (anti-coup) online groups to track them.” <a href="#footnote-45UCM" id="ref-45UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(We know this because Reuters journalists got hold of a high-placed defector from the Tatmadaw’s propaganda wing.)</p>
<p>When asked for comment, Facebook’s regional Director of Public Policy told Reuters that Meta<span></span> <span>“</span>‘proactively’ detected almost 98 percent of the hate speech removed from its platform in Myanmar.”</p>
<h2 id="wasting-our-lives-under-tarpaulin"><span>“</span>Wasting our lives under tarpaulin”</h2>
<p>The Rohingya people forced to flee Myanmar have scattered across the region, but the overwhelming majority of those who fled in 2017 ended up in the Cox’s Bazar region of Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The camps are beyond overcrowded, and they make everyone who lives in them vulnerable to the region’s seasonal flooding, to worsening climate impacts, and to waves of disease. This year, the refugees’ <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/news/stories/rohingya-refugees-face-hunger-and-loss-hope-after-latest-ration-cuts">food aid was just cut from the equivalent of $12 a month to $8 month</a>, because the international community is focused elsewhere.<a href="#footnote-46UCM" id="ref-46UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/burma-myanmar/new-cold-war-hein-myers">complex geopolitical situation surrounding post-coup Myanmar</a>—in which many western and Asian countries condemn the situation in Myanmar, but don’t act lest they push the Myanmar junta further toward China—seems likely to ensure a long, bloody conflict, with no relief in sight for the Rohingya.<a href="#footnote-47UCM" id="ref-47UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>The <span>UN</span> estimates that <a href="https://data.unhcr.org/en/country/bgd">more than 960,000 Rohingya refugees</a> now live in refugee camps in Bangladesh. More than half are children, few of whom have had much education at all since coming to the camps six years ago. The <span>UN</span> estimates that the refugees needed about $70.5 million for education in 2022, of which 1.6% was actually funded. <a href="#footnote-48UCM" id="ref-48UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Amnesty International spoke with Mohamed Junaid, a 23-year-old Rohingya volunteer math and chemistry teacher, who is also a refugee. He told Amnesty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though there were many restrictions in Myanmar, we could still do school until matriculation at least. But in the camps our children cannot do anything. We are wasting our lives under tarpaulin.<a href="#footnote-49UCM" id="ref-49UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In their report,<span></span> <span>“</span>The Social Atrocity,” Amnesty wrote that in 2020, seven Rohingya youth organizations based in the refugee camps made a formal application to Meta’s Director of Human Rights. They requested that, given its role in the crises that led to their expulsion from Myanmar, Meta provide just <em>one</em> million dollars in funding to support a teacher-training initiative within the camps—a way to give the refugee children a chance at an education that might someday serve them in the outside world.</p>
<p>Meta got back to the Rohingya youth organizations in 2021, a year in which the company cleared $39.3B in profits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, after discussing with our teams, this specific proposal is not something that we’re able to support. As I think we noted in our call, Facebook doesn’t directly engage in philanthropic activities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/digital-threats/rohingya-facebook-hate-speech/">In 2022, Global Witness came back for one more look at Meta’s operations in Myanmar</a>, this time with eight examples of real hate speech aimed at the Rohingya—actual posts from the period of the genocide, all taken from the <span>UN</span> Human Rights Council findings I’ve been linking to so frequently in this series. They submitted these real-life examples of hate speech to Meta as Burmese-language Facebook advertisements.</p>
<p>Meta accepted all eight ads.<a href="#footnote-50UCM" id="ref-50UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

						Berry is a ultra-lightweight dynamically typed embedded scripting language. It is designed for lower-performance embedded devices. The Berry interpreter-core's code size is less than 40KiB and can run on less than 4KiB heap (on ARM Cortex M4 CPU, Thumb ISA and ARMCC compiler).
					</p>
					<p>
						The interpreter of Berry include a one-pass compiler and register-based VM, all the code is written in ANSI C99. In Berry not every type is a class object. Some simple value types, such as int, real, boolean and string are not class object, but list, map and range are class object. This is a consideration about performance. Register-based VM is the same meaning as above.

							<h2>Lightweight</h2>
							<p>
								A well-optimized interpreter with very little resources. Ideal for use in microprocessors.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h2>Fast</h2>
							<p>
								Optimized one-pass bytecode compiler and register-based virtual machine.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h2>Powerful</h2>
							<p>
								Supports imperative programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h2>Flexible</h2>
							<p>
								Berry is a dynamic type script, and it's intended for embedding in applications. It can provide good dynamic scalability for the host system.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h2>Simple</h2>
							<p>
								Simple and natural syntax, support garbage collection, and easy to use FFI (foreign function interface).
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h2>RAM saving</h2>
							<p>
								With compile-time object construction, most of the constant objects are stored in read-only code data segments, so the RAM usage of the interpreter is very low when it starts.

							<div>
								<h3>Simple and intuitive syntax</h3>
								<p>
									The Berry language syntax is similar to that of high-level languages and will be familiar to most programmers.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
<pre><span>var</span> list <span>= [</span> <span>"Hello"</span><span>,</span> <span>"World"</span> ]
<span>for</span> text <span>:</span> list
    <span>print</span><span>(</span>text<span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<div>
								<h3>Map Instance</h3>
								<p>
									The map class is a built-in class type that is used to provide an unordered container of key-value pairs. Within the Berry interpreter, map map uses the Hash table to implement. You can use key-value pairs to construct a map container.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
<pre><span>var</span> map <span>= {</span>
    <span>'greets'</span><span>:</span> <span>def</span><span>()</span> <span>return</span> <span>'Hi!</span> <span>Berry</span><span>' </span><span>end</span> <span>()</span><span>,</span>
<span>    '</span><span>say</span><span>'   : '</span><span>Hello World</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
<span>    '</span><span>sum</span><span>'   : </span><span>10</span> <span>+</span> <span>50</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>for</span> i <span>:</span> map<span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>()</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span>i<span>,</span> <span>"\t=&gt;"</span><span>,</span> map<span>[</span>i<span>]</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<div>
								<h3>Object Orientation</h3>
								<p>
									To use a class, you must first declare it. The declaration of a class begins with the keyword class.
								</p>
								<p>
									The member variables and methods of the class must be specified in the declaration. This is an example of class declaration:
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
<pre><span>import</span> <span>string</span>

<span>class</span> Parent
    <span>#- member variables  -#</span>
    <span>var</span> fname
    <span>var</span> cname

    <span>#- constructor -#</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>init</span><span>()</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span>fname <span>=</span> <span>'Darth vader'</span>
    <span>end</span>

    <span>#- Method -#</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>say</span><span>()</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>string</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span>
            <span>'%s say</span><span>\n</span><span>%s %s'</span><span>,</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span>fname<span>,</span>
            <span>self</span><span>.</span>cname<span>,</span> <span>"i'm your father"</span>
        <span>)</span>
    <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<div>
								<h3>Class inheritance</h3>
								<p>
									Berry only supports single inheritance, that is, a class can only have one base class, and the base class uses the operator : to declare :
								</p>
								<p>
									Here the Child class inherits from the Parent class. The subclass will inherit all the methods and properties of the Parent class, and you can override them in the subclass. This mechanism is called Overload.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
<pre><span>class</span> Child <span>:</span> Parent
    <span>#- constructor -#</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span>name<span>)</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span>fname <span>=</span> <span>Parent</span><span>().</span>fname
        <span>self</span><span>.</span>cname <span>=</span> name
    <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

child <span>=</span> <span>Child</span><span>(</span><span>'Luke'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span> child<span>.</span><span>say</span><span>() )</span> <span>#child inherits from parent the say method</span>
</pre>

				<p id="speakable-summary">Brave Software, the maker of Brave Browser and Search, confirmed that it has laid off 9% of its staff across departments.</p>
<p>The company didn’t specify how many people were affected, but it corroborated the development and said the decision was driven by the tough economic climate.</p>
<p>“Brave eliminated some positions as part of our cost management in this challenging economic environment. Several departments were affected, amounting to 9% of our staff,” a company spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement.</p>
<p>The company has been taking steps to bolster its revenue sources this year. In April, Brave Search ditched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/28/brave-search-doesnt-use-bings-index-anymore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bing Index to start relying on its own indexing solution</a>. In May, the company released its <a href="https://brave.com/search-api-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own search API</a> for clients with plans starting from $3 per 1,000 queries. The API also offers different plans for AI data model training, data with storage rights, spellcheck, and autosuggest. Last month, Brave introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/privacy-focused-brave-search-launches-its-own-image-and-video-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image, news, and video results</a> as a part of its Search API.</p>
<p>Brave has also been testing a native AI assistant called Leo for its browser. While it plans to make it available to all users, Brave said that Leo will have<a href="https://brave.com/leo-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a premium tier</a> with features like higher rate limits and access to more conversation models. The company noted that this will help it pay for the cost of API access and hosting.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>In my previous article, I provided a comprehensive overview of my homelab. If you haven't had a chance to read it yet but are interested, you can find it at <a href="https://nerdyarticles.com/my-homelab-a-general-overview/">here</a>. In the upcoming articles, I'll delve into detailed guides on how to create a homelab like mine. However, from time to time, like now, I like to shift the focus and spotlight a service or project I'm particularly fond of.</p><p>In this article, I'll explore what Paperless-ngx (we'll call it Paperless for short) is and the benefits it offers. I'll also share how I've structured my Paperless installation. Finally, I'll provide my code for you to use in setting up your own instance. For now, I'll assume you already have a functional Docker environment ready to deploy your Paperless instance.</p><p>Introducing <a href="https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/?ref=nerdyarticles.com">Paperless-ngx</a>, your key to simplifying life by going digital! Are you tired of hunting for crucial documents when doing your taxes? With Paperless, that hassle is a thing of the past. This fantastic tool has built-in OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and learns from your categorized documents, making it a breeze to organize your files. Say goodbye to endless diggin through folders – now, all your essential documents are just a few clicks away. Once you've given Paperless a try for a while, you'll find that it consistently gets things right, reducing the need for manual adjustments. Say hello to a more streamlined and efficient way of managing your documents!</p><p>The big benefit of going digital in this space? Flexibility! Unlike traditional paper-based or folder-organized digital systems, your documents can belong to multiple categories at once. Ever wrestled with the dilemma of deciding which folder a document should go into? That's because it often fits more than one category. The solution? Tags. With a digital solution like Paperless, you can assign as many tags as you need, making categorization a breeze. Say goodbye to the folder confusion!</p><hr><h2 id="paperless-a-living-proof-of-open-source-greatness">Paperless: A Living Proof of Open Source Greatness</h2><p>In short: Paperless transitioned into Paperless-ng and then into Paperless-ngx</p><p><a href="https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless?ref=nerdyarticles.com">Paperless</a> was initiated by Daniel Quinn, with his initial commit to the GitHub project dating back to 6th June 2016. The version 1 release came on 3rd July 2018 (with the first release, 0.3.0, launched on 1st January 2017). The last release under Daniel Quinn's was on 27th January 2019.</p><p>As the original project began to lose momentum, Jonas Winkler's fork <a href="https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng?ref=nerdyarticles.com">Paperless-ng</a> emerged as the official successor. The first release (0.9) occurred on 18th November 2020, and the final release before the current transition was on 22nd August 2021.</p><p>At the time of writing this, <a href="https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx?ref=nerdyarticles.com">Paperless-ngx</a> is the official version and repository, having its inaugural release on 05th March 2022.</p><p>This journey exemplifies the strength of the open-source community. Even if a project experiences slowdowns or transitions, passionate contributors ensure its legacy lives on and continues to evolve.</p><p>Let's explore Paperless and my adoption of it. There are various approaches to adopting it, so find what suits you best. What works for me might just be the right fit for you too, or you might discover your own path along the way.</p><figure><img src="https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/2023/10/Paperless---Documents-Screenshot-blurred.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1892" height="958" srcset="https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/Paperless---Documents-Screenshot-blurred.png 600w, https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/Paperless---Documents-Screenshot-blurred.png 1000w, https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/Paperless---Documents-Screenshot-blurred.png 1600w, https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/2023/10/Paperless---Documents-Screenshot-blurred.png 1892w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>The documents view in Paperless-ngx</figcaption></figure><p>Here are the key feature of Paperless:</p><ol><li><strong>Document Management:</strong> Organize and manage your digital documents efficiently in the web.</li><li><strong>Tagging System:</strong> Easily categorize documents with tags for quick access.</li><li><strong>OCR Integration:</strong> Optical Character Recognition for extracting text from images and scanned documents.</li><li><strong>Automatic Categorization:</strong> Learns from your tags and categories to auto-classify future documents.</li><li><strong>Search Functionality:</strong> Powerful search capabilities to find documents swiftly.</li><li><strong>Multi-User Support:</strong> Collaborate with others by setting up multiple user accounts.</li><li><strong>Data Export:</strong> Export your documents and data for backup or migration purposes.

Always do your own research. I am only sharing what I am doing and not advising you to do the same.</p><p>Generally, I digitize what I'd put in a physical folder, which is not be every letter from banks, insurers, etc. </p><p>The next choice is whether to keep the physical copy or go digital only (make sure you have a proofen backup solution). In Germany, you must keep physical copies of certificates, notarized docs, property papers, vehicle papers, specific financial docs (contract-related, not just statements), insurance policies, passports, and ID cards. I shred and dispose of any document that don't require a physical copy. Fortunately, many documents are digital these days, saving me from making that decision and scanning them.</p><hr><h2 id="tagging-document-types-and-correspondents-my-organizational-secrets">Tagging, Document Types, and Correspondents: My Organizational Secrets</h2><p>To stay organized and efficient, it's crucial to consider document types, tags, and correspondents.</p><h3 id="correspondents">Correspondents</h3><p>This part is straightforward. Every sender of documents you upload to Paperless becomes a correspondent. You can add new correspondents on the fly when you review new documents. </p><p>I do make exceptions; for instance, invoices from online shops are assigned to 'Online Shops' rather than having their own correspondent. Thanks to the full-text search, finding what I need is easy within the hundreds of documents in the system.</p><h3 id="document-types">Document Types</h3><p>I put a lot of thought into document types when setting up Paperless, but rarely ever need them. Although I don't use them often, they don't hurt as Paperless is self-learning. </p><p>Here are the types I've set up: </p><ul><li>Invoice</li><li>Letter</li><li>Insurance</li><li>Contract</li><li>Other</li></ul><h3 id="tags">Tags</h3><p>Remember what we discussed earlier? Folders, whether they're physical or digital, limit us to just one category per document. Tags give us the power to assign multiple categories to a single document. So, go ahead, be a tagging superstar and create as many categories as your heart desires (and even assign them all to one document). It's your very own organizational playground!</p><p>In my experience, simplicity beats complexity. Keep it straightforward, no need for over-detailing. Plus, we've got this fantastic search feature to help you find what you need in a snap!</p><p>Now, let's dive into the magical world of tags.</p><h4 id="whos-affected">Who's Affected?</h4><p>I find it helpful to use distinct tags for the people the documents affect:</p><ul><li>Wife</li><li>Me</li><li>Family (for example all bills around the house, shared insurances, ...)</li></ul><h4 id="which-categories-are-affected">Which Categories Are Affected?</h4><p>I also like to create specific groupings to easily access all related documents.</p><ul><li>Car (You could also create a tag per car you own.)</li><li>Doctor</li><li>Expenses</li><li>House (Have more real estate? Create a tag per property.)</li><li>ToDo (Will cover this later.)</li></ul><p>For a smooth tax season, I rely on my tax tags, which make finding relevant documents a breeze.</p><ul><li>Tax (A general tag for all tax relevant documents.)</li><li>Tax always (I have documents, which are relevant for every year.)</li><li>Tax 2021</li><li>Tax 2022</li><li>Tax 2023</li><li>...</li></ul><p>Documents like insurance papers, which are relevant for more than one year, usually have three tax tags: the general one and the two for the years they are relevant for.</p><hr><h2 id="digitalization-made-easy-uploading-to-paperless-ngx">Digitalization Made Easy: Uploading to Paperless-ngx</h2><p>Now that everything is set up for organizing our documents, you might wonder how to get them in there. It's a straightforward process, with three simple methods (not counting potential mobile apps as a fourth option).</p><p>This is also where the 'ToDo' tag comes into play. Regardless of how the documents are imported into Paperless, the ToDo tag is set. I have created a so-called 'view', which displays all documents with the ToDo tag, and added that view to my homepage. This is essentially my inbox in Paperless, which I go through from time to time to check if everything is set correctly.</p><figure><img src="https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/2023/10/Paperless---Homescreen-Screenshot.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1899" height="952" srcset="https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/Paperless---Homescreen-Screenshot.png 600w, https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/Paperless---Homescreen-Screenshot.png 1000w, https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/Paperless---Homescreen-Screenshot.png 1600w, https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/2023/10/Paperless---Homescreen-Screenshot.png 1899w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>The Paperless-ngx start screen with documents in my 'inbox'.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="uploading">Uploading</h3><p>In your web browser, click the upload button, select your file(s), and click upload. For an even easier method, just drag and drop your file(s) into the Paperless browser window, no matter where you are in Paperless. It's that simple!</p><h3 id="email-inbox">Email Inbox</h3><p>You can have Paperless periodically scan a specific email inbox and import files from there. It could be your standard inbox, and you watch for a certain topic or folder, or you just set up a new inbox and forward emails with documents you want to import to that inbox. This is what I do, and let's have a quick look at how to set that up.</p><p>After you have added an email inbox to monitor in the settings, you can specify what the importer will actually watch for and do.</p><figure><img src="https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/2023/10/Paperless---Mail-rule-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1136" height="812" srcset="https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/Paperless---Mail-rule-1.png 600w, https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/Paperless---Mail-rule-1.png 1000w, https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/2023/10/Paperless---Mail-rule-1.png 1136w"><figcaption>Settings for the email importer</figcaption></figure><p>What you can see in the picture above is that my rule 'Main Importer' will import from 'Paperless Mail Inbox' (the name I gave the configuration of the email inbox to monitor). It watches the folder 'INBOX', processes all PDF documents, uses the file's name as the document name, sets the 'ToDo' tag, and deletes the email. </p><p>Don't worry about the 'Do not assign a correspondent' option; this actually means that the self-learning algorithm will try to set the correct correspondent.</p><h3 id="auto-import-from-a-folder">Auto import from a folder</h3><p>You can also have Paperless watch a specific folder and import all documents from there. This is especially useful if you already have many digital documents you want to import initially or if you have a scanner with the ability to scan to a network share.</p><hr><h2 id="effortless-editing-perfecting-your-documents">Effortless Editing: Perfecting Your Documents</h2><p>Paired with the OCR process and the self-learning algorithm, editing newly added documents is very easy and fast. Remember, though, that the self-learning algorithm needs to learn from your documents. Any new correspondent will definitely be wrong, as it will try to set a known correspondent. After some time, it will become a matter of just making sure everything is correct.</p><p>The title is something I neraly always redo, to make it very meaningful, in order to identify the document very quickly.</p><p>I have learned that the it also is a tricky part to set the right date. There are a few to choose from (dates from the files meta data, dates in the header, or any other dates mentioned in the document). It gets it right most times, but do pay attention to it.</p><figure><img src="https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/2023/10/Paperless---Edit-Window-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="522" height="697"><figcaption>Editing view for Paperless-ngx documents</figcaption></figure><p>In the above screenshot, you can see a freshly imported document, which I can now check if everything is correct. Is it a new correspondent? No need to leave the window; you can create it straight from the input field here, same for the Document Type and Tags.</p><p>The archive serial number can also be very useful (I don't use it). The serial number will automatically count upwards by one from the last serial number used. You can then write this number on the physical document and just put it in a folder, without any extra organization. Are you now looking for a document, just look up the serial number, identify the folder, ...</p><p>The last step when I am done is removing the 'ToDo' tag and 'Save &amp; Close' the document.</p><p>You've come a long way (or maybe you jumped ahead to grab my Docker config). Now, let's chat about how I've configured my Paperless instance to run in Docker. To make this work, we'll need three containers: a database (usually PostgreSQL, which I prefer), a Redis broker for scheduled tasks, and, of course, Paperless-ngx itself.</p><h2 id="redis-container">Redis Container</h2><p>Alright, let's kick things off with the easiest part: the Redis broker.</p><pre><code>paperless-redis:
  container_name: paperless-redis
  image: redis:7.2-alpine #fixedVersion
  restart: unless-stopped
  networks:
    - backend
  security_opt:
    - no-new-privileges:true
  volumes:
    - ./paperless/redis:/data
  environment:
    REDIS_ARGS: "--save 60 10"</code></pre><p>Here are some important points to highlight in my Docker Compose code for the Redis broker:</p><p><strong>Naming Convention:</strong> I use a naming convention for supporting services, where it's structured as &lt;Name of the supported service&gt;-&lt;Name of the supporting service&gt;. In this case, it's 'paperless-redis,' and this convention applies to both the service and container name.</p><p><strong>Fixed Image Version:</strong> I always specify a fixed image version for supporting services. This helps prevent issues when upgrading the Docker stack. It ensures that the version I'm using is compatible with my main service. This is particularly crucial for databases, where version mismatches can require migration steps.</p><p><strong>Docker Networks:</strong> I organize my Docker containers into two networks:</p><ul><li><strong>Frontend:</strong> This network is for services that run behind my reverse proxy and require outside access (outside means outside of the server running docker).</li><li><strong>Backend:</strong> This network is for services that solely support other services and don't need outside access.</li></ul><p><strong>Container Privileges:</strong> I specify that the container cannot have additional privileges, which enhances security.</p><p><strong>Bind Mount (Volume Path):</strong> I follow a specific structure for the bind mount (volume path). It starts with a folder named after the main service and then includes a subfolder named after the supporting service. This organization makes it easy to remove a specific configuration if I decide to discard something I've experimented with.</p><p><strong>Redis Configuration:</strong> Specific to Redis, I set an environment variable that instructs it to save its state to disk every 60 seconds or after 10 write operations. This ensures data durability.</p><p>If you're wondering why there's no port setting, it's because we're working within a Docker network. We can access the container ports without explicitly defining them here. The port definition creates a port mapping between the container and the host machine/VM.</p><div data-kg-toggle-state="close"><div><h4>Warning: Ports ignore firewall rules</h4></div><p>It's worth noting that the default Docker network (bridge network) isn't affected by rules from an iptables-based firewall. I'll dive deeper into this in an upcoming article about securing your Docker setup.</p></div><h2 id="postgresql-container">PostgreSQL Container</h2><p>When it comes to databases in my self-hosting setup, I'm a fan of PostgreSQL. It's my preferred choice. In the case of Paperless-ngx, it defaults to PostgreSQL, but you do have the option to run MariaDB if that's your preference. I personally also always deploy a DB per service and do not reuse the same DB twice.</p><p>Let's have a look at the docker compose of the database.</p><pre><code>paperless-postgres:
  container_name: paperless-postgres
  image: postgres:16.0-alpine #fixedVersion
  restart: unless-stopped
  networks:
    - backend
  security_opt:
    - no-new-privileges:true
  volumes:
    - ./paperless/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  environment:
    POSTGRES_USER: DBUSERNAME
    POSTGRES_DB: DBNAME
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/paperless_db_paperless_passwd
    #POSTGRES_PASSWORD: $PasswordFromEnvFile
  secrets:
    - paperless_db_paperless_passwd</code></pre><p>I prefer to use a docker secret for the password if the image supports it. I've also included a commented-out line for providing the password via a .env file if you prefer that method.</p><p>Since I'm using a secret, I need to map it appropriately. I'll be covering the use of secrets in a future article about securing your Docker environment. Stay tuned for that!</p><h2 id="paperless-ngx-container">Paperless-ngx Container</h2><p>Finally, let's get to the main reason you're here: the Docker Compose configuration for my Paperless-ngx container.</p><pre><code>paperless:
  container_name: paperless
  image: ghcr.io/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx:latest

    PAPERLESS_FILENAME_FORMAT: "{created_year}/{correspondent}/{created} {title}"
    PAPERLESS_URL: "&lt;YOUR PAPERLESS URL&gt;"
    PAPERLESS_ALLOWED_HOSTS: PAPERLESS_URL</code></pre><p>Let's take a closer look at some of the specific details in the Docker Compose configuration:</p><p><strong>Networks:</strong> We join both networks because we want Paperless to communicate with the reverse proxy (not setup or covered in this article) and other services on the backend network.</p><p><strong>Ports:</strong> To access Paperless from other devices on your local network, we create a port mapping, which would not be needed when using a reverse proxy.</p><p><strong>Depends On:</strong> This ensures that the specified containers are running before starting Paperless.</p><p><strong>Volumes:</strong> We use volumes for data persistence, including our documents and Paperless configuration. I usually use NFS mounts for media, export, and consume which go straight to my NAS. For simplicity, bind mounts are used here.</p><h3 id="environment-variables">Environment Variables</h3><p><strong><a href="https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/configuration/?ref=nerdyarticles.com#USERMAP_UID">USERMAP_UID</a> &amp; <a href="https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/configuration/?ref=nerdyarticles.com#USERMAP_GID">USERMAP_GID</a>:</strong> It's a good practice to set these to the IDs of your personal user on the Docker host system.

Volunteers are still recovering bird carcasses within 1.5 miles of McCormick Place, the largest convention center in North America, which is largely covered with glass.</p><figure id="c0ed8bc4-3e0f-4a18-86ea-c0e2140ffd11" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:1,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/07/nyc-migrating-birds-night-lights-architecture&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;New York’s plan to save birds from crashing into buildings: lights out&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;c0ed8bc4-3e0f-4a18-86ea-c0e2140ffd11&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>“It’s the tip of an iceberg but it’s it’s a huge, huge amount of birds we found both dead and injured,” said Annette Prince, director of Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, adding that this was the highest number of bird strikes that the group recorded from the grounds of one building in a single day.</p><p>From late Wednesday, 4 October, through early Thursday, 5 October, a peak estimate of <a href="https://dashboard.birdcast.info/region/US-IL-031?night=2023-10-04" data-link-name="in body link">1.5 million</a> birds were in the air over Cook county, home to the Chicago metropolitan area. Carcasses of <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Tennessee_Warbler/id#" data-link-name="in body link">Tennessee warblers</a>, <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Hermit_Thrush/id#" data-link-name="in body link">hermit thrush</a>, <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/American_Woodcock/id" data-link-name="in body link">American woodcocks</a> and other varieties of songbirds were recovered.</p><p>“Not every bird that hits the window is going to leave behind a body,” said Brendon Samuels, who researches bird window collisions at the University of Western Ontario.</p><p>He noted that the true extent of affected birds will unravel over a couple of days as people continue to pick up birds around downtown Chicago.</p><p>“In fact, we often see birds collide with glass and they continue flying some distance away, seriously injured in ways that ultimately they won’t survive past a few hours,” Samuels added.</p><p>Birds <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/07/nyc-migrating-birds-night-lights-architecture" data-link-name="in body link">dying</a> in large numbers in a small geographic area tends to occur during peak migration periods in spring and fall. Weather conditions like opposing wind, rain and fog can make it difficult for birds to orientate themselves, in addition to light pollution from cities that can draw them in and trap them among deadly structures.</p><p>“Anywhere you’ve got glass, you’re gonna have birds hitting the windows,” said Bryan Lenz at the American Bird Conservancy. Annually, up to a <a href="https://abcbirds.org/blog/truth-about-birds-and-glass-collisions/" data-link-name="in body link">billion</a> birds die due to collisions, and in the case of Chicago, the dead and injured birds were most likely flying from Canada en route to South and Central America.</p><p>Everywhere birds visit, they perform essential ecosystem services that have economic value and are necessary for the functioning of ecosystems. Following major wildfires like those in Canada, birds that return to burned areas can disperse <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320712004247#:~:text=Remnant%20trees%20or%20artificial%20perches,shrubs%20in%20post%2Dfire%20areas." data-link-name="in body link">seeds</a> and aid forest landscape regeneration.

Turning off building lights is one way to reduce fatalities. A 2021 <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2101666118" data-link-name="in body link">study</a> done in McCormick Place, the same site of Thursday’s bird deaths, found that shutting off half the lights in large buildings can reduce collisions by six to 11 times. McCormick Place is a participant of the <a href="https://www.mccormickplace.com/birds/" data-link-name="in body link">Lights Out Chicago</a> program, which has buildings voluntarily switch off or dim lights at night unless someone is inside.</p><p>“It is important to understand that there is an event going on at Lakeside Center [part of McCormick Place] this week, so, therefore, the lights have been on when occupied. Once the space is unoccupied, the lights have been turned off,” said a representative from McCormick Place.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-12" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>“It’s a known hazard, and yet we still can’t see action being taken about it,” says Prince.</p><p>Having window glass with visual markers like dots or patterns can break up the appearance of reflection and let birds recognize whether there is a safe passage for them to fly through.</p><p>In 2020, Chicago approved a bird-friendly design ordinance but it is yet to take effect. In 2021, the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, signed the Bird Safe Buildings Act, which “requires bird-friendly design to be incorporated into the construction and renovation of state-owned buildings” in the state, per <a href="https://gl.audubon.org/news/new-law-will-protect-illinois-birds-deadly-building-collisions" data-link-name="in body link">Audobon.org</a>.</p><p>“We have a lot of existing buildings that are killing birds, not just new construction,” said Samuels, adding that investments in retrofits, creating tax credits for such environmental initiatives and making windows more bird-friendly can be an economical way to solve this. “We already have solutions, we just need to put those into policy.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/90-new-server-design/">https://www.marginalia.nu/log/90-new-server-design/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37800753">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>So the search engine is moving to a new server soon, thanks to the generous grant
<a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/88-futo-grant/">mentioned recently</a>.</p><p>If you visit search.marginalia.nu now, it may or may not use the old or new server. It’ll be like this for
a while, since I need them both for testing and maintenance type work.</p><p>I’ll also apologize if this post is a bit chaotic. It is a reflection of a very chaotic couple of weeks that
apart from setting up this migration also involved a very short notice invitation for a
presentation at <a href="https://opensearchfoundation.org/en/events-osf/5th-international-open-search-symposium-ossym2023/">ossym23</a>.</p><p>This project seems to generate a lot of goodwill from the technologically inclined,
so when I went to order the server, they sent me an email stating they liked what I was
doing and offered a free CPU upgrade. From dual Epyc 7443 to 7543. Thanks <a href="https://mullet.se/">Mullet
Scandinavia!</a> (Swedish website).</p><p><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/90-new-server-design/server.jpeg" alt="New server"></p><p>So the server’s a big beefy one. The machine has 512 GB of RAM and 10x8 plus 2x4 TB SSDs,
and the aforementioned dual Epyc 7543s for a whopping 128 logical cores.</p><p>Some decisions needed to be made about how to deploy the search engine
onto the server. The software will need some modifications to make
good use of the hardware, but that’s a later worry.</p><h2 id="os-setup">OS Setup</h2><p>We’re going Debian Bookworm.</p><p>The idea has always been to skip RAID for the index drives and run multiple index
partitions on at least 8 of the 8 TB drives, keeping the other two for spare storage
space, testing, and ready to be wiped and repurposed with short notice.</p><p>If a drive croaks, 12.5% of the index needs to be reconstructed on one of the
two spare drives, which would be an inconvenience and a temporary loss of capacity
but it’s not catastrophic end of the world type stuff.</p><p>Since most of what search engines do is embarassingly parallel along
the axis of domains, this basic design makes sense. The machine has
64 physical cores and a bunch of disks, so we want to put them all to
work where possible.</p><p>Keeping each shard on a different physical disk by design reduces
resource contention, which is desirable since the expected access
pattern will be a shotgun blast of requests hitting each partition
at the exact same time, triggering an intense flurry of reads.</p><h2 id="page-faults">Page Faults</h2><p>There are still lingering concerns with this approach. The software
is based around memory mapped storage, and Linux’ page fault handler
can only put up with so many page faults at any given time.</p><p>A potential way around this is virtualization, to run multiple operating
systems on the same machine.</p><p>There are clear drawbacks with this. Each operating system essentially gets
a fixed allocation of RAM, something like 32-48 GB. This can lead to quite a lot of
wasted resources, VM #3 may really need 64 GB instead of 48 GB at a point
where VM #4 may have 24 GB to spare. The single-machine paradigm will permit
large processing jobs to borrow small amounts of RAM from each partition without
disruption.</p><p>I think the drawbacks of virtualization outweigh the benefits here. It’s probably
easier to re-code the index to reduce the amount of page faults if necessary than to reclaim the
wasted RAM and resources. It’s also very hard to backpedal on a setup
like this, it would essentially entail wiping the entire server and rebulding it
from scratch, storing dozens of terabytes of crawl data god knows where in the
meantime.</p><p>A core value for the project is to make the best use of the hardware available. Much
of what you’d consider conventional wisdom in this field is based around the assumption
of hardware being cheap, and development being expensive. In this project, it is the other
way around, even now with a server 10X as powerful as the previous one.</p><h2 id="resilience-and-recovery">Resilience and recovery</h2><p>Having more important hard drives increases the odds of disk failure in the same way throwing
more dice increases the chance of rolling a 1. Disk failure needs to be considered
a real possibility and factored into the design.</p><p>There are two failure modes.</p><h3 id="single-disk-error">Single Disk Error</h3><p>One of the two OS disks can fail without any interruption to operations, thanks to RAID1.</p><p>In the scenario where one of the index disks were to fail, the capacity of the
system will drop by 12.5% for about a day. At this point one of the two spare drives
will be repurposed into a new index disk. This capacity drop is a tolerable inconvenience.</p><h3 id="disaster">Disaster</h3><p>In the case of a more unlikely scenario, with multiple simultaneous failure of several drives, the system is designed to be <em>eventually</em> recoverable from just scraps of the data. With the design proposed, you’d need simultaneous failure of seven hard different drives to put a permanent end to operations.</p><ul><li>You can regenerate the crawl data from the domain database (RAID 1).</li><li>You can regenerate the index from crawl data.</li><li>You can regenerate the domain database from crawl data.</li><li>You can regenerate the index from index backups.</li><li>You can regenerate the domain database from database backups (2 physical disks, also hot spare).</li></ul><p>Some of this is accomplished by using a daisy-chained data layout where disk N carries the Nth index, crawl data for shard (N-1), and index-backups for shard (N+1). Thus to eradicate all knowledge of shard 3, disks 2, 3 and 4 would need to die along with both the backup disks and both the main OS disks.</p><p><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/90-new-server-design/factorio.png" alt="In which a thousand hours of Factorio shine through"></p><h2 id="daisy-daisy">Daisy, daisy…</h2><p>This design has every potential to become difficult to reason about without careful thought being put into the execution.</p><p>The sane way of accomplishing this disk assignment scheme is to have one directory of mounted disk partitions, and to use a parallel tree of symlinks to accomplish the distribution, and then have the code only interact with the symlinks while the operating system deals with the rest.</p><p>Like so:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>/app/index/1/backup  -&gt;   /disk/2/backup
/app/index/1/current -&gt;   /disk/1/current
/app/index/1/storage -&gt;   /disk/0/storage
/app/index/1/work    -&gt;   /disk/1/work

/app/index/2/backup  -&gt;   /disk/3/backup
/app/index/2/current -&gt;   /disk/2/current
/app/index/2/storage -&gt;   /disk/1/storage
/app/index/2/work    -&gt;   /disk/2/work

...
</code></pre><h2 id="software">Software</h2><p>Finally, a note about adapting the software. The first stage migration will just
run the existing code on a single partition, but moving forward, the aim is to make
modifications to be able to have multiple backing indexes.</p><p>Since one of the objectives of the project paradoxically is to build search engine software
that doesn’t require an insane monster of a server like this, this also makes sense, since
it keeps the indexes “PC sized” and might permit a cluster-based solution elsewhere.</p><p>There are other dev-ex benefits to keeping the working data sets small as well, it’s just less of
a pain to work with 100 GB files than 40 TB ones…</p><p>…</p><p>This is all written sort of mid-configuration. Nothing is quite final. A copy of the search engine
is up on the new server, but it’s all a bit of a construction space right now. It’s really great to
have two servers though, since the old one is still around, if I need some downtime, I can just re-direct
the DNS to the old IP.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>With the schematic completed, go back to the Project Window and open the PCB
Editor, either by clicking the PCB Editor button or opening the board file.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="pcb_editor_basics">PCB Editor Basics</h3>
<p>Navigation in the PCB Editor is the same as the Schematic editor: pan by
dragging with the middle mouse button or right mouse button, and zoom with the
scrollwheel or <kbd>F1</kbd>/<kbd>F2</kbd>.</p>
<p>The main part of the PCB Editor is a canvas where the board will be designed.
The toolbar on the left side has various display options for the board,
including units and toggles for outline/filled display modes for tracks, vias,
pads, and zones. The toolbar just to the right of the canvas contains tools for
designing the PCB.</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td>
Some buttons on the right toolbar have a small triangle in the bottom
right corner <span><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/pcbnew_palette_buttons.png" alt="pcbnew palette buttons"></span>. The triangle
indicates that the button has an expanding palette containing several
related tools, for example different kinds of dimensions. To select an
alternate tool, click and hold on the button until the palette appears,
then click on the alternate tool. Another way to use the palettes is to
click on the button and drag to the left until the palette appears, then
release the mouse button when the desired tool is highlighted.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>At far right is the Appearance Panel and Selection Filter. The Appearance panel
is used to change visibility, colors, and opacity of PCB layers, objects, and
nets. The active layer is changed by clicking on the name of a layer.</p>
<p>Below the Appearance Panel is the Selection Filter, which enables and disables
selection of various types of PCB objects. This is useful to select specific
items in a crowded layout.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="board_setup_and_stackup">Board Setup and Stackup</h3>
<p>Before designing the board, set the page size and add information to the title
block. Click <strong>File</strong> → <strong>Page Settings…​</strong>, then choose an appropriate paper
size and enter a date, revision, and title.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/layout-page-setup.png" alt="Layout Page Settings">
</p>
</div>
<p>Next, go to <strong>File</strong> → <strong>Board Setup…​</strong> to define how the PCB will be
manufactured. The most important settings are the stackup, i.e. what copper and
dielectric layers the PCB will have (and their thicknesses), and the design
rules, e.g. sizes and spacing for tracks and vias.</p>
<p>To set the stackup, open the <strong>Board Stackup</strong> → <strong>Physical Stackup</strong> page of
the Board Setup window. For this guide, leave the number of copper layers at 2,
but more complicated projects might require more layers.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/board-setup-stackup.png" alt="Physical Stackup">
</p>
</div>
<p>Next, go to the <strong>Design Rules</strong> → <strong>Constraints</strong> page. The settings on this
page specify the overriding design rules for everything in the board design. For
the purposes of this guide, the defaults are fine. However, for a real project
these should be set according to the capabilities of the PCB fab house so that
the PCB design is manufacturable.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/board-setup-constraints.png" alt="Constraints">
</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, open the <strong>Design Rules</strong> → <strong>Net Classes</strong> page. A net class is a set
of design rules associated with a specific group of nets. This page lists the
design rules for each net class in the design and allows assigning nets to each
net class.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/board-setup-net-classes.png" alt="Net Classes">
</p>
</div>
<p>Track width and spacing can be managed manually by the designer during layout,
but net classes are recommended because they provide an automatic way to manage
and check design rules.</p>
<p>In this design, no net classes are specified, so all nets will belong to the
<code>Default</code> net class. The default design rules for this net class are
acceptable for this project, but other designs may have multiple net classes,
each with different design rules. For example a board might have a <code>High
Current</code> netclass with wide traces, or a <code>50 ohm</code> netclass with specific width
and clearance rules for 50 ohm controlled-impedance traces.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="importing_changes_from_schematic">Importing Changes From Schematic</h3>
<p>The schematic is complete, but there are not yet any components in the layout.
To import design data from the schematic into the layout, click <strong>Tools</strong> →
<strong>Update PCB from Schematic…​</strong>, or press <kbd>F8</kbd>. There is also a button
<span><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/update_pcb_from_sch_24.png" alt="update pcb from sch 24"></span> in the top toolbar.</p>
<p>Read through the messages in the <strong>Changes To Be Applied</strong> window, which will
say that the three components in the schematic will be added to the board. Click
<strong>Update PCB</strong>, <strong>Close</strong>, and click on the canvas to place the three
footprints. The location of each footprint relative to the others will be
changed later.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/update-pcb-from-schematic.png" alt="Update PCB from Schematic">
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/footprints-added.png" alt="Footprints Added">
</p>
</div>
<p>In KiCad, updating the PCB with changes in the schematic is a manual process:
the designer decides when it is appropriate to update the PCB with modifications
in the schematic. Each time the schematic is edited, the designer must use the
<strong>Update PCB from Schematic</strong> tool to keep the schematic and layout in sync.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="drawing_a_board_outline">Drawing A Board Outline</h3>
<p>Now the three components have been placed, but the board itself has not been
defined. The board is defined by drawing a board outline on the <code>Edge.Cuts</code>
layer.</p>
<p>It’s often useful to draw the board outline with a coarse grid, which makes
it easy to get round numbers for the board size. Switch to a coarse grid by
selecting 1mm in the Grid dropdown menu above the canvas.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/coarse-grid.png" alt="1mm grid">
</p>
</div>
<p>To draw on the <code>Edge.Cuts</code> layer, click <strong>Edge.Cuts</strong> in the Layers tab of the
Appearance panel at right. Choose the rectangle tool
<span><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/add_rectangle_24.png" alt="add rectangle 24"></span>in the right toolbar, and use it to draw a
rectangle roughly surrounding the three footprints. The other graphic tools

that doesn’t intersect itself.</p>

<h3 id="placing_footprints">Placing Footprints</h3>
<p>The next step in the layout process is to arrange the footprints on the board.
In general, there are a several considerations for positioning footprints:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some footprints may have exact requirements for their locations, such as
connectors, indicators, or buttons and switches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some components may need to be placed according to electrical considerations.
Bypass capacitors should be close to the power pins of the associated IC and
sensitive analog components should be far from digital interference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost all components have a "Courtyard" (or two if both Front and Back are
defined). Generally Courtyards should not intersect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise components should be positioned for ease of routing. Connected
components should generally be close together, and arranged to minimize
routing complexity. The ratsnest (the thin lines indicating connections
between pads) is useful for determining how best position footprints relative
to other footprints.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For the purposes of this guide, the only placement goal is to make the routing
process as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Start by moving the battery holder <code>BT1</code> onto the back side of the board. Click
it to select it, then press <kbd>M</kbd> to move it. Press <kbd>F</kbd> to flip it to the
opposite side; it now appears mirrored and its pads have changed from red to
blue.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/bt1-flipped.png" alt="BT1 flipped to the back">
</p>
</div>
<p>All PCB layers are viewed from front side of the board. Footprints on the bottom
of the board are therefore upside down and appear mirrored.</p>
<p>Each PCB layer has a unique color, which is shown by the swatches in the Layers
tab of the Appearance panel. In the default color scheme, items on the <code>F.Cu</code>
(Front Copper) layer are red, while items on the <code>B.Cu</code> (Back Copper) are blue.</p>
<p>Now place the other two components. One at a time, select each component, then
move and rotate it with <kbd>M</kbd> and <kbd>R</kbd>. Watch the ratsnest lines between
each pad to choose the simplest arrangement of components; a good arrangement
will leave the lines untangled. One possible arrangement is shown in the
screenshot below.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/footprints-positioned.png" alt="Footprints positioned optimally">
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="routing_tracks">Routing Tracks</h3>
<p>With the components in place, it’s time to connect the pads with copper traces.</p>
<p>The first trace will be drawn on the front of the board, so change the active
layer to <code>F.Cu</code> in the Layers tab of the Appearance panel.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Route Tracks</strong> <span><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/add_tracks_24.png" alt="add tracks 24"></span> in the right-hand
toolbar or press <kbd>X</kbd>. Click on the <code>led</code> pad of <code>D1</code>. The ratsnest line
indicates there is an unrouted connection to the <code>led</code> pad of <code>R1</code>, so click on
that pad to draw a trace connecting the two pads. Clicking on the second pad
completes the trace. The ratsnest line between the <code>led</code> pins is no longer drawn
because the connection has been made in copper.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/route-first-connection.png" alt="First connection routed">
</p>
</div>
<p>Now draw a trace between the <code>GND</code> pads of <code>BT1</code> and <code>D1</code>, starting with the <code>BT1</code>
pad on the back of the board. Notice that the active layer automatically changed
to <code>B.Cu</code> after clicking on the <code>BT1</code> pad. Click on the <code>D1</code> pad to finish the
track.</p>
<p>While <code>BT1</code> has surface mount pads that are only on the bottom of the board,
<code>D1</code> has through hole pads that can connect to tracks on both the front and
back. Through hole pads are one way to make a connection between multiple
layers. In this case, <code>D1</code> is a component on the front side of the board, but
its through hole pads are used to connect to a trace on the back of the board.</p>
<p>Another way to make a connection across layers is with a via. Start routing at the
<code>VCC</code> pad of <code>BT1</code> on the back of the board. Press <kbd>V</kbd> and click halfway
between <code>BT1</code> and <code>R1</code> to insert a via, which also switches the active layer to
<code>F.Cu</code>. Complete the track on the top side of the board by clicking on the
<code>VCC</code> pad of <code>R1</code>.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/routing-complete.png" alt="All connections routed">
</p>
</div>
<p>At this point, all connections are routed. This can be confirmed by looking at
the status screen in the bottom left of the window, where the number of unrouted
nets is given as 0.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="placing_copper_zones">Placing Copper Zones</h3>
<p>Copper zones are often used for ground and power connections because they
provide a lower impedance connection than traces.</p>
<p>Add a <code>GND</code> zone on the bottom of the board by switching to the bottom copper
layer and clicking the <strong>Add a filled zone</strong> button
<span><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/add_zone_24.png" alt="add zone 24"></span> in the right toolbar. Click on the PCB to place
the first corner of the zone.</p>
<p>In the Copper Zone Properties dialog that appears, select the <code>GND</code> net and make
sure that the <code>B.Cu</code> layer is selected. Click <strong>OK</strong>, then click to place the other
three corners of the zone. Double click when placing the last corner to complete
the zone.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/zone-outline.png" alt="Zone outline">
</p>
</div>
<p>The zone outline is displayed on the canvas, but the zone is not yet filled — there is no copper in the zone area, and therefore the zone is not making any
electrical connections. Fill the zone with <strong>Edit</strong> → <strong>Fill All Zones</strong>
(<kbd>B</kbd>). Copper has been added to the zone, but it doesn’t connect to the
<code>VCC</code> or <code>led</code> pads and traces, and is clipped by the board edge. It overlaps
with the <code>GND</code> trace drawn earlier, and it connects to the <code>GND</code> pads through
thin traces. These are thermal reliefs, which make the pads easier to solder.
Thermal reliefs and other zone settings can be modified in the zone properties
dialog.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/zone-filled.png" alt="Filled copper zone">
</p>
</div>
<p>In KiCad, zones are not filled automatically when they are first drawn or
modified, or when footprints within them are moved. Zones are refilled by
manually filling them and when running <a href="#drc">DRC</a>. Make sure zone fills are
up-to-date before generating <a href="#fab">fabrication outputs</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes filled zones can make it hard to see other objects in a crowded board
design. Zones can be hidden except for their boundaries using the <strong>Show only
zone boundaries</strong> button <span><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/show_zone_disable_24.png" alt="show zone disable 24"></span> on the
left-hand toolbar. Zones retain their filled status when only their outlines are
shown — hiding a zone fill is not the same as unfilling it.</p>
<p>Zones can also be made transparent using the Appearance panel, and inactive
layers can also be hidden or dimmed using the <strong>Layer Display Options</strong> in the
Appearance Panel.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="drc">Design Rule Checking</h3>
<p>Design Rule Checking is the layout equivalent of Electrical Rule Checking for
the schematic. DRC looks for design mistakes like mismatches between the
schematic and layout, copper regions that have insufficient clearance or are
shorted together, and traces that do not connect to anything. Custom rules can
also be written in KiCad 7.0. To view the full list of design rules that are
checked and to adjust their severity, go to <strong>File</strong> → <strong>Board Setup…​</strong> →
<strong>Design Rules</strong> → <strong>Violation Severity</strong>. Running DRC and fixing all errors
is strongly advised before generating <a href="#fab">fabrication outputs</a>.</p>
<p>Run a DRC check with <strong>Inspect</strong> → <strong>Design Rules Checker</strong>, or use the button
<span><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/erc_24.png" alt="erc 24"></span> in the top toolbar. Click <strong>Run DRC</strong>. When the
checks are complete, no errors or warnings should be reported. Close the DRC
window.</p>
<p>Now intentionally cause a DRC error by moving the resistor footprint to overlap
the filled area of the zone. Use <kbd>D</kbd> (Drag) to move the resistor footprint
slightly while keeping the traces attached to its pads. This creates a clearance
violation because the <code>VCC</code> and <code>led</code> pads of the resistor are shorted to the
<code>GND</code> zone fill. Ordinarily this would be fixed by refilling the zone, but don’t
refill the zone yet.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/resistor-moved.png" alt="Resistor footprint moved to violate clearance">
</p>
</div>
<p>Run DRC again, but make sure to uncheck the <strong>Refill all zones before performing
DRC</strong> checkbox. DRC reports 6 violations: for each pad of <code>R1</code>, there is a
clearance violation between the pad and the zone, another clearance violation
between the pad’s through hole and the zone, and a third violation where the
pad’s solder mask opening exposes the copper of two different nets (the <code>GND</code>
fill and the trace connected to the pad). Arrows point to each violation in the
canvas. Clicking on each violation message zooms in on the respective
violation.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/drc-errors.png" alt="DRC errors due to clearance violation between R1 and GND">
</p>
</div>
<p>Close the DRC dialog, press <kbd>B</kbd> to refill the zone, and re-run DRC.
Alternatively, check the <strong>Refill all zones before performing DRC</strong> checkbox and
re-run DRC. All violations are fixed.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="3d_viewer">3D Viewer</h3>
<p>KiCad offers a 3D viewer that is useful for inspecting the PCB. Open the 3D
viewer with <strong>View</strong> → <strong>3D Viewer</strong>. Pan by dragging with the middle mouse
button, and orbit by dragging with the left mouse button. Orbit around the PCB
to see the LED and resistor on the top, and the battery holder on the bottom.</p>
<p>A raytracing mode is available, which is slower but offers more accurate
rendering. Switch to the raytracing mode with <strong>Preferences</strong> →
<strong>Raytracing</strong>.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/raytracing.png" alt="Raytraced view of the PCB">
</p>
</div>
<p>Many of the footprints in KiCad’s library come with 3D models, including all of
the footprints used in this guide. Some footprints do not come with 3D models,
<a href="#footprints-and-3d-models">but users can add their own</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="fab">Fabrication Outputs</h3>
<p>With the board design finished, the final step is to generate fabrication
outputs so the board can be manufactured.</p>
<p>Open the Plot dialog with <strong>File</strong> → <strong>Plot…​</strong>. This dialog can plot the
design in several formats, but Gerber is usually the right format for ordering
from a PCB fabricator.</p>
<p>Specify an output directory so that the plotted files will be collected in a
folder. Otherwise, the default settings are fine, but make sure all the necessary
layers are checked: include the copper layers (<code>*.Cu</code>), board outline
(<code>Edge.Cuts</code>), soldermask (<code>*.Mask</code>), and silkscreen (<code>*.Silkscreen</code>).
The paste layers (<code>*.Paste</code>) are useful for manufacturing solder paste
stencils. The Adhesive layers (<code>*.Adhesive</code>) are needed only if any
components will be glued to the board during assembly. Other layers may be
useful to plot, but are not typically necessary for PCB fabrication.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/fabrication-outputs.png" alt="Plot dialog">
</p>
</div>
<p>Click <strong>Plot</strong> to generate the Gerber files. Also click <strong>Generate Drill
Files…​</strong> and then <strong>Generate Drill File</strong> to create files specifying the
location of all holes that will be drilled in the board. Finally, close the Plot
dialog. The design is finished.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/images/generate-drill-files.png" alt="Generate Drill Files dialog">

<p>A jury this week awarded $228.5 million to seven plaintiffs in their case against Nevada-based water company Real Water, which sold alkaline water tainted with hydrazine, a highly toxic chemical found in fuel for rockets and spacecraft.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs included a 7-month-old boy who was hospitalized with severe liver failure and nearly needed a liver transplant. Another was a 69-year-old woman who was hospitalized for liver failure after drinking the water for years. She died in the hospital on November 11, 2020.
</p><p>They are among around a hundred people who say they have suffered acute liver toxicity and failure from the water and have filed lawsuits against Real Water, according to attorney Will Kemp. In an interview Friday, Kemp told Ars he represents a little over 60 of the plaintiffs, including the seven in the case that received a jury verdict this week. It was the first case to go to trial.</p>
<p>Jurors for the case in the 8th Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nevada, found Real Water liable for $200 million in punitive damages and $28.5 million in compensatory damages. Two other defendants, Hanna Instruments and Milwaukee Instruments, which were alleged to have made faulty water testing meters that contributed to Real Water's toxicity, were also found liable for compensatory damages but not punitive damages.</p>
<p>"We're hoping that the punitive award sends a message to people that they should test bottled water products before they put them on the market," Kemp told Ars.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The jury trial, which spanned mid-September to this week, also revealed how the water poisoned people: It contained hydrazine, which was likely to have formed during the company's untested water processing method, according to Kemp and an expert witness.</p>
<h2>Poisonous process</h2>
<p>The poisonings came to light in early 2021 when the local authorities in Nevada and the Food and Drug Administration announced that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/03/complaints-mount-after-5-kids-suffer-liver-failure-linked-to-alkaline-water/">at least five infants and children had suffered liver failure after drinking the water</a>. The findings led to a recall, but some of the company's products remained on the market. In May 2021, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Real Water Inc. on behalf of the FDA, alleging the company's officers, Brent Jones and his son, Blain Jones, were selling adulterated products made amid multiple manufacturing violations. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/at-least-25-poisoned-1-dead-from-real-alkalized-water-cdc-report-reveals/">As Ars previously reported</a>, the Joneses agreed to settle the case in June, and the DOJ bound them with a permanent injunction from ever preparing, processing, or selling water again.</p>
<p>A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in November 2021 laid out 25 cases of acute liver failure linked to the water—22 in Nevada and three in California, all of which occurred at the end of 2020. Specifically, the cases were linked to Real Water's 5-gallon Re<sup>2</sup>al Water product, sold in multiple southwestern states in places like Whole Foods.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<time datetime="2023-09-28">2023-09-28</time>
<p>To be precise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE-754</a> floating point
subtraction is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_completeness">functionally
complete</a>. That means you
can construct any binary circuit using nothing but floating point subtraction.</p>
<p>To see how, we must start at the bottom. I quote the IEEE 754-2019 standard, section 6.3:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="6-3-the-sign-bit"><a href="#6-3-the-sign-bit" aria-label="Anchor link for: 6-3-the-sign-bit">6.3 The sign bit</a></h3>
<p>[…] When neither the inputs nor result are NaN, […]; the sign of a sum, or of a difference $x−y$
regarded as a sum $x+(−y)$, differs from at most one of the addends’ signs; […].
These rules shall apply even when operands or results are zero or infinite.</p>
<p>When the sum of two operands with opposite signs (or the difference of two operands with like
signs) is exactly zero, the sign of that sum (or difference) shall be $+0$ under all rounding-direction
attributes except <code>roundTowardNegative</code>; under that attribute, the sign of an exact zero sum (or
difference) shall be $−0$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s dissect that.</p>
<ol>
<li>A subtraction $x - y$ is considered a sum $x + (-y)$.</li>
<li>Zero can have a sign, $-0$ and $0$ are distinct entities (although they compare
equal when testing with <code>==</code>).</li>
<li>If both of the addends have the same sign, the output must have that sign.
However, for $x - y$ that means if $x$ and $y$ have <em>different</em> signs the output
must have the sign of $x$.</li>
<li>If $x$ and $y$ have the same sign, and $x - y$ is zero, the output will be
$+0$ for all rounding modes except <code>roundTowardNegative</code>, then it will be $-0$.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now since the default rounding mode in virtually every context is <code>roundTiesToEven</code>,
we shall assume that from now on. However, everything works analogously even for
<code>roundTowardNegative</code>.</p>
<h2 id="a-truth-table"><a href="#a-truth-table" aria-label="Anchor link for: a-truth-table">A truth table</a></h2>
<p>So, what does that give us when subtracting zeroes?</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>-</span><span>0 </span><span>- -</span><span>0 </span><span>= +</span><span>0  </span><span># Same sign, must be +0.
</span><span>-</span><span>0 </span><span>- +</span><span>0 </span><span>= -</span><span>0  </span><span># Different signs, sign from first argument.
</span><span>+</span><span>0 </span><span>- -</span><span>0 </span><span>= +</span><span>0  </span><span># Different signs, sign from first argument.
</span><span>+</span><span>0 </span><span>- +</span><span>0 </span><span>= +</span><span>0  </span><span># Same sign, must be +0.
</span></code></pre>
<p>Interesting… What if we say that $-0$ is false and $+0$ is true?</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>A B | O
</span><span>----+--
</span><span>0 0 </span><span>| </span><span>1
</span><span>0 1 </span><span>| </span><span>0
</span><span>1 0 </span><span>| </span><span>1
</span><span>1 1 </span><span>| </span><span>1
</span></code></pre>
<p>Our resulting truth table is equivalent to ${A \vee \neg B}$, or ${B \to A}$ (also known as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMPLY_gate">IMPLY</a> gate, albeit with the arguments swapped). It turns
out this truth table is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_completeness">functionally
complete</a>, which means we can make arbitrary
circuits using only this gate.
Technically speaking, it is only functionally complete if given access to the
constant false. This is necessary to produce a NOT gate, and NOT + IMPLY is
a functionally complete set. I don’t know a better term for ‘functionally complete
if given access to some constant value’, however.</p>

<h2 id="subtraction-circuits"><a href="#subtraction-circuits" aria-label="Anchor link for: subtraction-circuits">Subtraction circuits</a></h2>
<p>Let’s build a demo in Python. First we’ll define our constants and allow us to print them nicely.
Note that even though they are distinct entities, $+0$ and $-0$ compare equal in IEEE 754 floating
point, so we must first extract the sign before comparing to 0 to distinguish.</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>import </span><span>math
</span><span>
</span><span>f_false = -</span><span>0.0
</span><span>f_true = </span><span>0.0
</span><span>f_repr = </span><span>lambda </span><span>x: </span><span>True </span><span>if </span><span>math.copysign(</span><span>1</span><span>, x) &gt; </span><span>0 </span><span>else </span><span>False
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can now make a NOT gate by using the fact that $-0 - x$ flips the sign of
zero $x$:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>f_not = </span><span>lambda </span><span>x: f_false - x
</span></code></pre>
<p>Let’s test that:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_not(f_false))
</span><span>True
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_not(f_true))
</span><span>False
</span></code></pre>
<p>Great! We can also build an OR gate by noticing that if we flip the sign of
the second argument before subtracting, we always get $+0$ (true) unless
both arguments are $-0$ (false):</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>f_or = </span><span>lambda </span><span>a, b: a - f_not(b)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Let’s test it out:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_or(f_false, f_false))
</span><span>False
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_or(f_true,  f_false))
</span><span>True
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_or(f_false, f_true))
</span><span>True
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_or(f_true, f_true))
</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now that we have OR and NOT, we can make all other gates, e.g.:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>f_and = </span><span>lambda </span><span>a, b: f_not(f_or(f_not(a), f_not(b)))
</span><span>f_xor = </span><span>lambda </span><span>a, b: f_or(f_and(f_not(a), b), f_and(a, f_not(b)))
</span></code></pre>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_and(f_false, f_false))
</span><span>False
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_and(f_true,  f_false))
</span><span>False
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_and(f_false, f_true))
</span><span>False
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_and(f_true, f_true))
</span><span>True
</span><span>
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_xor(f_false, f_false))
</span><span>False
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_xor(f_true,  f_false))
</span><span>True
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_xor(f_false, f_true))
</span><span>True
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_xor(f_true, f_true))
</span><span>False
</span></code></pre>

<p>You may have heard of soft-float, software implementations of floating point
using integers. Let’s turn that on its head: an integer implementation done in

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>John Carmack, celebrated software engineer and founder of Keen Technologies, and <a href="https://www.amii.ca/about/our-people/richard-s-sutton/">Dr. Richard Sutton</a>, Chief Scientific Advisor at the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii) announce a partnership to bring greater focus and urgency to the creation of artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p><p>This partnership is the first public milestone for Keen Technologies, following its initial funding announcement in August of 2022. The initial $20M round was led by Nat Friedman, Danial Gross, Patrick Collision, Tobi Lutke, Jim Keller, Sequoia Capital, and Capital Factory. In December 2022, Carmack departed as consulting CTO at Meta to focus his efforts on AGI.</p><p>Sutton is the principal founder of the field of reinforcement learning. His work with Keen Technologies advances previously announced research priorities to understand basic computational intelligence. Through this work, documented in part in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11173">The Alberta Plan</a>, Sutton seeks to understand and create long-lived computation agents that interact with a vastly more complex world and come to predict and control their sensory input signals.</p></div><div><p>“Amii is proud to support our Chief Scientific Advisor and friend, Rich Sutton, in his partnership with Keen Technologies," said <a href="https://www.amii.ca/about/our-people/cam-linke/">Cam Linke</a>, CEO of Amii. "Rich is a deep, intentional researcher and pioneer in AI and has led the field for decades. Both Rich and John have each had enormous impacts on their respective fields and it is exciting to see two tech visionaries, who are optimistic about AI’s future, team up to move artificial intelligence forward.”</p><p>Carmack and Sutton are deeply focused on developing a genuine AI prototype by 2030, including establishing, advancing and documenting AGI signs of life.</p><p>Sutton will retain his current roles as Amii’s Chief Scientific Advisor, a Professor at the University of Alberta, Canada CIFAR AI Chair, and an Amii Fellow based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.</p><hr><p><b>About John Carmack</b></p><p>John Carmack defined the now ubiquitous “first-person shooter” gaming genre at Id Software with Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, and Quake, while pioneering the adoption of many computer graphic techniques, including binary space partitioning, light mapping, tangent space bump-mapping, and megatexturing. His early involvement with the creation of GPUs to accelerate 3D gaming has now come full circle with their use to accelerate AI.</p><p>At Armadillo Aerospace, he built reusable rocket ships, both autonomous and piloted, with a wide variety of propulsion and control systems.</p><p>In 2012, he ushered in the modern era of virtual reality with the Oculus Rift prototype, using GPU distortion compensation and TimeWarp temporal reprojection technologies to enable low-cost systems to outperform exotic professional ones. He went on to champion the development of mobile, all-in-one VR systems at Meta, leading to the current Meta Quest line.</p><p>In 2022, he founded Keen Technologies to work on the fundamental challenges of AGI.</p><p>For his technical work, John has been awarded two Emmys, a BAFTA fellowship, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Game Developers Conference, and is in the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame.</p><p>Keen Technologies has a globally distributed team based in Dallas, TX, United States of America.</p><p><b>About Dr. Richard Sutton</b></p><p>Richard S. Sutton is one of the pioneers of reinforcement learning, a field in which he continues to lead the world. Over his career, he has made several significant contributions, including the theory of temporal-difference learning, the actor-critic (policy gradient) class of algorithms, the Dyna architecture (integrating learning, planning and reacting), the Horde architecture, and gradient and emphatic temporal-difference algorithms. He was the original founder of the Reinforcement Learning &amp; Artificial Intelligence Lab at the University of Alberta, and he is co-author of Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, the standard textbook on reinforcement learning, now in its second edition. Sutton has been named a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, the Royal Society of Canada, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, and the Canadian Artificial Intelligence Association (CAIAC), where he also received a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2018. His publications have been cited more than 130,000 times. He has been featured in popular publications such as Science, the Economist, the New York Times, the Wallstreet Journal, and Bloomberg’s Hello World.</p></div><div>

Humans give up on CAPTCHA puzzles <a href="https://www.math.unipd.it/~gaggi/doc/ads20.pdf">approximately 15% of the time</a> and, maddeningly,<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/searles"> CAPTCHAs are significantly easier for bots</a> to solve than they are for humans. We’ve spent the past three and a half years working to build a better experience for humans that’s just as effective at stopping bots. As of this month, we’ve finished replacing every CAPTCHA issued by Cloudflare with<strong> </strong>Turnstile, our new CAPTCHA replacement (pictured below). Cloudflare will never issue another visual puzzle to anyone, for any reason.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/image2.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="878" height="300"></figure><p>Now that we’ve eliminated CAPTCHAs at Cloudflare, we want to make it easy for anyone to do the same, even if they don’t use other Cloudflare services. We’ve decoupled Turnstile from our platform so that any website operator on any platform can use it just by adding <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/turnstile-demo-workers/blob/main/src/explicit.html#L74-L85">a few lines of code</a>. We’re thrilled to announce that Turnstile is now generally available, and <strong>Turnstile’s ‘Managed’ mode is now completely free to everyone for unlimited use</strong>. </p><h3 id="easy-on-humans-hard-on-bots-private-for-everyone">Easy on humans, hard on bots, private for everyone</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/image6-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1999" height="607"></figure><p>There’s a lot that goes into Turnstile’s simple checkbox to ensure that it’s easy for everyone, preserves user privacy, and does its job stopping bots. Part of making challenges better for everyone means that everyone gets the same great experience, no matter what browser you’re using. Because we do not employ a visual puzzle, users with low vision or blindness get the same easy to use challenge flow as everyone else. </p><p>It was particularly important for us to avoid falling back to audio CAPTCHAs to offer an experience accessible to everyone. Audio CAPTCHAs are often much worse than even visual CAPTCHAs for humans to solve, with only<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/burszstein_2010_captcha.pdf"> 31.2% of audio challenges</a> resulting in a three-person agreement on what the correct solution actually is. The prevalence of free speech-to-text services has made it easy for bots to solve audio CAPTCHAs as well, with <a href="https://uncaptcha.cs.umd.edu/papers/uncaptcha_woot17.pdf">a recent study</a> showing bots can accurately solve audio CAPTCHAs in over 85% of attempts. We’re proud to state that Turnstile is WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant, while eliminating the need for audio CAPTCHAs as well as visual ones.</p><p>We also created Turnstile to be privacy focused. Turnstile meets <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-eprivacy-directive/">ePrivacy Directive</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-the-gdpr/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-the-ccpa/">CCPA</a> compliance requirements, as well as the strict requirements of our own privacy commitments. In addition, Cloudflare's <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/FR2000863987">FedRAMP Moderate authorized package</a>, "Cloudflare for Government" now includes Turnstile. We don’t rely on tracking user data, like what other websites someone has visited, to determine if a user is a human or robot. Our business is protecting websites, not selling ads, so operators can deploy Turnstile knowing that their users’ data is safe.</p><p>With all of our emphasis on how <em>easy</em> it is to pass a Turnstile challenge, you would be right to ask how it can stop a bot. If a bot can find <a href="https://www.vox.com/22436832/captchas-getting-harder-ai-artificial-intelligence">all images with crosswalks</a> in grainy photos faster than we can, surely it can check a box as well. Bots definitely can check a box, and they can even<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01003"> mimic the erratic path of human mouse movement</a> while doing so. For Turnstile, the actual act of checking a box isn’t important, it’s the background data we’re analyzing while the box is checked that matters. We find and stop bots by running a series of in-browser tests, checking browser characteristics, native browser APIs, and asking the browser to pass lightweight tests (ex: proof-of-work tests, proof-of-space tests) to prove that it’s an actual browser. The current deployment of Turnstile checks billions of visitors every day, and we are able to identify browser abnormalities that bots exhibit while attempting to pass those tests.</p><p>For over one year, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/end-cloudflare-captcha/">we used our Managed Challenge</a> to rotate between CAPTCHAs and our own Turnstile challenge to compare our effectiveness. We found that <strong>even without asking users for any interactivity at all</strong>, Turnstile was just as effective as a CAPTCHA. Once we were sure that the results were effective at coping with the response from bot makers, we replaced the CAPTCHA challenge with our own checkbox solution. We present this extra test when we see potentially suspicious signals, and it helps us provide an even greater layer of security.</p><h3 id="turnstile-is-great-for-fighting-fraud">Turnstile is great for fighting fraud</h3><p>Like all sites that offer services for free, Cloudflare sees our fair share of automated account signups, which can include “new account fraud,” where bad actors automate the creation of many different accounts to abuse our platform. To help combat this abuse, we’ve rolled out Turnstile’s invisible mode to protect our own signup page. This month, we’ve blocked <strong>over</strong> <strong>1 million automated signup attempts </strong>using Turnstile, without a reported false positive or any change in our self-service billings that rely on this signup flow. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="lessons-from-the-turnstile-beta">Lessons from the Turnstile beta</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/image5-11.png" alt="" loading="lazy" title="Chart" width="1200" height="742"></figure><p>Over the past twelve months, we’ve been grateful to see how many people are eager to try, then rely on, and integrate Turnstile into their web applications. It’s been rewarding to see the developer community embrace Turnstile as well. We list some of the community created Turnstile integrations <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/community-resources/">here</a>, including integrations with WordPress, Angular, Vue, and a Cloudflare recommended <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@marsidev/react-turnstile">React library</a>. We’ve listened to customer feedback, and added support for <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/reference/supported-languages/">17 new languages</a>, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/client-side-rendering/">new callbacks</a>, and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/reference/client-side-errors/">new error codes</a>. </p><p>76,000+ users have signed up, but our biggest single test by far was the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-scaled-and-protected-eurovision-2023-voting/">Eurovision final vote</a>. Turnstile runs on challenge pages on over 25 million Cloudflare websites. Usually, that makes Cloudflare the far and away biggest Turnstile consumer, until the final Eurovision vote. During that one hour, challenge traffic from the Eurovision voting site outpaced the use of challenge pages on those 25 million sites combined! Turnstile handled the enormous spike in traffic without a hitch. </p><p>While a lot went well during the Turnstile beta, we also encountered some opportunities for us to learn. We were initially resistant to disclosing why a Turnstile challenge failed. After all, if bad actors know what we’re looking for, it becomes easier for bots to fool our challenges until we introduce new detections. However, during the Turnstile beta, we saw a few scenarios where legitimate users could not pass a challenge. These scenarios made it clear to us that we need to be transparent about why a challenge failed to help aid any individual who might modify their browser in a way that causes them to get caught by Turnstile. We now publish detailed client-side error codes to surface the reason why a challenge has failed. Two scenarios came up on several occasions that we didn’t expect: </p><p>First, we saw that desktop computers at least 10 years old frequently had expired motherboard batteries, and computers with bad motherboard batteries very often keep inaccurate time. This is because without the motherboard battery, a desktop computer’s clock will stop operating when the computer is off. Turnstile checks your computer’s system time to detect when a website operator has accidentally configured a challenge page to be cached, as caching a challenge page will cause it to become impassable. Unfortunately, this same check was unintentionally catching humans who just needed to update the time. When we see this issue, we now surface a clear error message to the end user to update their system time. We’d prefer to never have to surface an error in the first place, so we’re working to develop new ways to check for cached content that won’t impact real people. </p><p>Second, we find that a few privacy-focused users often ask their browsers to go beyond standard practices to preserve their anonymity. This includes changing their user-agent (something bots will do to evade detection as well), and preventing third-party scripts from executing entirely. Issues caused by this behavior can now be displayed clearly in a Turnstile widget, so those users can immediately understand the issue and make a conscientious choice about whether they want to allow their browser to pass a challenge.</p><p>Although we have some of the most sensitive, thoroughly built monitoring systems at Cloudflare, we did not catch either of these issues on our own. We needed to talk to users affected by the issue to help us understand what the problem was. Going forward, we want to make sure we always have that direct line of communication open. We’re rolling out a new feedback form in the Turnstile widget, to ensure any future corner cases are addressed quickly and with urgency.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-29-at-11.37.58.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1608" height="464"></figure><h3 id="turnstile-ga-and-free-for-everyone">Turnstile: GA and Free for Everyone </h3><p>Announcing Turnstile’s General Availability means that Turnstile is now completely production ready, available for free for unlimited use via our visible widget in Managed mode. Turnstile Enterprise includes SaaS platform support and a visible mode without the Cloudflare logo. Self-serve customers can expect a pay-as-you-go option for advanced features to be available in early 2024. Users can continue to access Turnstile’s advanced features below our 1 million siteverify request limit, as has been the case during the beta.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Game development serves as a vibrant canvas for one's creativity. Especially when focusing on small games, which are simple to create and instantly enjoyable, one can quickly immerse oneself in their allure. Through this article, I aim to delve into the joy of crafting small games.</p>
<p>In the section <a href="https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/fun_to_make_small_games.html" target="_blank">"Making Small Games, Which Is Fun in Itself"</a>, the essence of what small games are and why creating them is enjoyable will be explored. Developing small games is not merely a training ground for bigger projects, but it holds its unique charm.</p>
<p>When embarking on creating a small game, deciding on which programming language or game engine to utilize is an initial hurdle. In the <a href="https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/device_and_environment.html" target="_blank">"Target Devices and Development Environment"</a> section, I have gathered information regarding these concerns.</p>
<p>Conceiving the core idea is key to small game creation. The section <a href="https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/ideas/" target="_blank">"How to Come Up with Ideas for Small Games"</a> provides tips on brainstorming such ideas. Furthermore, in <a href="https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/restrictions/" target="_blank">"Constraints: A Catalyst for Creativity and Game Completion"</a>, the method of imposing constraints on game input methods or resolution to foster better ideas is discussed.</p>
<p>In small games, it’s common for the gameplay to gradually become more challenging as the game progresses. <a href="https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/difficulty/" target="_blank">"What Constitutes Appropriate Difficulty in Small Games"</a> deliberates on how to set a level of difficulty that players find moderately challenging.</p>
<p>A game is dull without some flavor. In <a href="https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/make_game_juicy.html" target="_blank">"Making Games ‘Juicy’"</a>, the methods to enrich the game by adding effects and sound, centering around the term 'juicy', are introduced.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/tools/" target="_blank">"Creating Your Own Game Development Tools"</a>, the narrative extends to creating custom libraries or game engines alongside your game. While crafting tools for the game is immensely enjoyable, it’s a double-edged sword as diving too deep may hinder the game’s completion.</p>
<p>For the quick creation of small games, there’s a method of auto-generating graphics and sound. <a href="https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/procedural/" target="_blank">"Enhancing Development through Automation"</a> introduces ways to have the computer generate pixel art, background music, sound effects, and levels.</p>
<p>If computers could create games, they would further ease human effort. <a href="https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/generation/" target="_blank">"Can Small Games Be Self-Generated?"</a> contemplates the possibility of computers developing games from scratch, focusing on the utilization of AI chatbots.</p>
<p>I've woven various topics concerning small game development throughout this article. Through this narrative, I hope readers will feel the charm of small game development, and that this may serve as a catalyst for many to take up the challenge of creation.</p>
