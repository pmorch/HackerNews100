            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/seekbytes/IPA">https://github.com/seekbytes/IPA</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41377960">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Interactive PDF Analysis</h2><a id="user-content-interactive-pdf-analysis" aria-label="Permalink: Interactive PDF Analysis" href="#interactive-pdf-analysis"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Interactive PDF Analysis</em> (also called IPA) allows any researcher to explore the inner details of any PDF file. PDF files may be used to carry malicious payloads that exploit vulnerabilities, and issues of PDF viewer, or may be used in phishing campaigns as social engineering artefacts.
The goal of this software is to let any analyst go deep on its own the PDF file. Via IPA, you may extract important payload from PDF files, understand the relationship across objects, and infer elements that may be helpful for triage of malicious or untrusted payloads.</p>
<p dir="auto">The main inspiration goes to the fantastic people behind Zynamics, and their excellent product, called PDF dissector.</p>
<p dir="auto">
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/seekbytes/IPA/blob/main/data/screenshot.png"><img alt="Main window of IPA" src="https://github.com/seekbytes/IPA/raw/main/data/screenshot.png" width="600"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Simplifying analysis of PDF files</h2><a id="user-content-simplifying-analysis-of-pdf-files" aria-label="Permalink: Simplifying analysis of PDF files" href="#simplifying-analysis-of-pdf-files"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When I started reverse engineering malware, the main tool available for analysing malicious payloads consisted of <a href="https://didierstevens.com/" rel="nofollow">Didier Stevens</a>'s excellent tools. Having become a <em>de facto</em> standard, one of the main problems with these tools was the fact that they could be used from the command line, having to remember a very large combination of flags, reporting the numbers of the various objects. Although analysis and developers have to contend with all kinds of command-line tools on a daily basis, this does not mean that we cannot create a new graphical file inspection tool.</p>
<p dir="auto">In fact, part of static analysis and reverse engineering fields also focuse on how to display the most salient information to the analyst from the point of view of user experience. Didier Stevens' tools, as well as peepdf, are already used and well broken in. However, the analyst could use something graphical in order to be able to understand the relationship between the various objects, to understand which pages they refer to and which object types (images, fonts, colours, metadata), to export stream content in a simple way and to see the content of dictionaries in table form.</p>
<p dir="auto">The main source of inspiration comes from the tool developed by Zynamics called PDF-dissector: the excellent feedback from some former users and the constant requests to release it open source spurred me to spend a few days creating this tool.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Extract and analyze metadata to identify the creator, creation date, modification history, and other essential details about the PDF file.</li>
<li>Examine the structure of the PDF document by analyzing its objects (such as text, images, and fonts) and pages to understand their relationships, content, and layout.</li>
<li>Visualize References that point to other objects or locations within the file, such as images, fonts, or specific sections.</li>
<li>Extract and save raw data streams from the PDF file to a specified location, allowing for detailed examination and analysis of the underlying binary content.</li>
<li>Implement a lighter analysis that attempts to salvage usable information from a corrupted or partially damaged PDF file, even when traditional parsing methods fail.</li>
<li>Does not require any additional software, libraries, or external services to function thanks to pdf-rs and Rust compatibility.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The tool can be compiled with Rust and cargo. No dependencies are required apart from Rust, and the crates pulled.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/seekbytes/IPA
cd IPA

## compile with debug symbols, the binary is inside ./target/debug/IPA
cargo b 

## compile in release mode, the binary is inside ./target/release IPA

<span><span>#</span># compile with debug symbols, the binary is inside ./target/debug/IPA</span>

<span><span>#</span># compile in release mode, the binary is inside ./target/release IPA</span>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Credits</h2><a id="user-content-credits" aria-label="Permalink: Credits" href="#credits"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/pdf-rs/pdf">pdf-rs</a> team for their awesome library (if you have any issues parsing a PDF file, you might want to open an issue for them)</li>
<li>Zynamics for the inspiration of pdf dissector</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/emilk/egui">egui</a> for a solid immediate GUI mode</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Limitations</h2><a id="user-content-limitations" aria-label="Permalink: Limitations" href="#limitations"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">IPA has the following limitations for now:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>few heuristics (if you want to suggest some, please open a new issue or write me an email)</li>
<li>no support for encrypted PDF (panics at opening, soon I'll implement a way to handle it if you know the password)</li>
<li>not every PDF file is supported due to some strict requirements that pdf-rs assumes while opening it. If you have a PDF file that should be parsable, please open an issue to <a href="https://github.com/pdf-rs/pdf/issues">pdf-rs</a> repository.</li>
<li>some object types are not viewable natively. This is something I'm still brainstorming on: e.g. graphical elements, colors.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">At the end, the tool can be really improved and I pretty bet some people will notice how bad my code is. If you're one of these, please let me know about potential improvements, better patterns, and any suggestion.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contact</h2><a id="user-content-contact" aria-label="Permalink: Contact" href="#contact"></a></p>

<p>Today we learn that Pavel Durov, founder of the popular messaging app Telegram, has been arrested as his private jet landed in France. </p>



<p>Early indications are that the arrest stems from Telegram’s alleged noncompliance with French requests for content moderation and data disclosure:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>BREAKING: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Telegram?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Telegram</a> CEO Pavel Durov arrested by French authorities.</p><p>Early official comments to French media suggest this follows from France's displeasure with Telegram's moderation &amp; compliance with official requests(?).</p><p>If so, I'm pretty sure this is an unprecedented action… <a href="https://t.co/hKa1Ip0buD">pic.twitter.com/hKa1Ip0buD</a></p></div>— John Scott-Railton (@jsrailton) <a href="https://twitter.com/jsrailton/status/1827457960110399604?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>A bit of legal background is called for.</p>



<p>Most social media companies of global significance that are not Chinese are headquartered in the United States. This is no accident; the United States (wisely) undertook policy moves in the late 1990s to minimize liability for the operators of online services, most notably the enactment of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which (essentially) says that operators of social media websites are not liable for the torts or crimes of their users. </p>



<p>There are of course some, very narrow, exceptions to this rule. For example, illegal pornography is subject to a mandatory takedown-and-reporting regime under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2258A" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2258A">18 U.S. Code § 2258A</a>. I hasten to add that complying with this law is table stakes for a user-generated content business, compliance tools like PhotoDNA are widely available and free to use, and I would be shocked if Telegram <em>didn’t</em> comply. There’s also FOSTA-SESTA, which prohibits operators of online platforms from running services which knowingly support sex trafficking or prostitution with the intent to facilitate the same (see: <em><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-az/us-v-michael-lacey">United States v. Lacey et al. (Backpage)</a></em>, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230">47 U.S. Code § 230(e)(5)</a>), <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2421A">18 US Code § 2421A</a>). This law will be a major compliance concern for any dating app, and is a reason why sites which once had “personals” listings like CraigsList, which were non-core to the rest of their offering, <a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/FOSTA">got rid of</a> those “dating”-specific features. One can still post a prostitution ad in the used boat listings, but Craigslist can’t be said to have intended to facilitate that behavior.</p>



<p>Other than that, though, social media website operators are generally not liable for the torts or crimes of their users. Nor are they liable under aider/abettor theories if they just passively host the content. (See: <em>Twitter v. Taamneh</em>, <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2022/21-1496">598 U.S. _ (2023</a>) – civil liability for aiding and abetting, at least on this side of the pond, requires “knowing and substantial assistance,” and federal criminal liability – as state criminal law is disapplied by Section 230 – requires specific intent to assist in the commission of a crime). </p>



<p>This means that if, for example, I use Facebook to organize drug deals, Facebook (a) is under no obligation to scan its services for unlawful use and (b) is under no obligation to restrain that use, and will generally be immune civilly from my misuse unless Facebook “materially contributes,” i.e. specifically encourages, that unlawful use (see e.g. <em><a href="https://casetext.com/case/force-v-facebook-inc">Force v Facebook</a>,</em> 934 F.3d 53 (2d Cir. 2019), where Facebook was held not civilly liable under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/topn/justice_against_sponsors_of_terrorism_act">JASTA</a> to victims of Hamas, which used Facebook to disseminate propaganda online; see also <em>Taamneh,</em> supra), and will not be liable criminally (a) under state criminal law by operation of Section 230, and (b) under federal criminal law to the extent that Facebook does not willfully and knowingly aid, abet, counsel, or procure the commission of the offense with specific intent, per <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2">18 USC § 2</a>.</p>



<p>Most countries do not such a permissive regime. France is part of that group. In 2020, for example, the <em><a href="https://www.dilcrah.gouv.fr/nos-missions/lutter-contre-la-haine-en-ligne">Loi Lutte Contra la Haine sur Internet</a></em> <em>(Law against hate speech on the Internet)</em> in relation to which global Internet companies can be fined $1.4 million per instance, and up to 4% of their total worldwide revenue, for failing to restrict “hate speech” (which in the United States constitutes “protected speech”) from their websites. Similarly, Germany has its law, the <em>Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz</em> or “Network Enforcement Act” (sometimes referred to as the “Facebook-gesetz” but more commonly referred to by its acronym, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/05/tough-new-german-law-puts-tech-firms-and-free-speech-in-spotlight">NetzDG</a>), in relation to which politically inflammatory content must come down or the government has the power to impose fines north of EUR 50 million.</p>



<p>Not being a French lawyer, it is difficult for me to figure out exactly what legislative provisions are being invoked here. The charging documents or the warrant will tell us more when they’re published. I’m pretty sure we’re not looking at fine proceedings against Telegram Messenger, Inc. under the hate speech law e.g. or the EU DSA, because if we were, Durov would not have been dragged off a plane in handcuffs. TFI Info, the French media outlet which broke the story, <a href="https://www.tf1info.fr/justice-faits-divers/info-tf1-lci-le-fondateur-et-pdg-de-la-messagerie-cryptee-telegram-interpelle-en-france-2316072.html">suggests</a> that the charges might be something along the lines of an aiding and abetting offense, or possibly conspiracy:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>[The Ministry of] Justice considers that the lack of moderation, cooperation with law enforcement and the tools offered by Telegram (disposable number, cryptocurrencies, etc.) make it an <strong>accomplice</strong> in drug trafficking… and fraud.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>More will be revealed when the arrest warrant is made public. If, for example, it is revealed that Durov did in fact actively assist criminal users with access to the platform, for example a drug user wrote to the support channel stating: “I would like to sell drugs on your platform. How do I do this?” And Durov replied to that with assistance, then his goose would be just as cooked in America as it would be in France. </p>



<p>If, however, the French are simply saying that Durov’s failure to police his users or respond promptly to French document requests is the crime (which I suspect is the case), then this represents a dramatic escalation in the online censorship wars. What it means is that European states are going to try to extraterritorially dictate to foreign companies what content those companies can and cannot host on foreign-based webservers.</p>



<p>If correct, this would represent a major departure from the U.S.-compliant approach most U.S.-headquartered social companies currently take, which has generally governed the global compliance strategies of most non-China social media companies, including any which offer greater or lesser degrees of full encryption on their services (Telegram’s “Secret Chats” feature, WhatsApp, and Signal among them). In brief, platforms thought that if they didn’t specifically intend their platforms to be put to criminal use, they’re unlikely to find themselves on the receiving end of criminal charges. That’s not true anymore, apparently.</p>



<p>Telegram is not the only company in the world which has a social media platform used for unlawful purposes. Facebook’s popular encrypted messaging app WhatsApp has, famously, been <a href="https://prestonbyrne.com/2021/08/15/did-america-just-lose-afghanistan-because-of-whatsapp/">used for years</a> by the erstwhile non-state terror organization in, and now rulers of, Afghanistan, the Taliban. This fact was widely known by NATO generals and reported in the press during the Afghan war, and was even reported on again <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/17/world/asia/taliban-whatsapp-afghanistan.html">in the New York Times</a> as recently as last year:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>About a month after Mr. Inqayad, the security officer, was unable to reach his commanders during the night operation, he begrudgingly bought a new SIM card, opened a new WhatsApp account and began the process of recovering lost phone numbers and rejoining WhatsApp groups.</p>



<p>Sitting at his police post, a refurbished shipping container with a hand-held radio, Mr. Inqayad pulled out his phone and began scrolling through his new account. He pointed out all of the groups he is a part of: one for all of the police in his district, another for the former fighters loyal to a single commander, a third he uses to communicate with his superiors at headquarters. In all, he says, he is a part of around 80 WhatsApp groups — more than a dozen of which are used for official government purposes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Of course, the Taliban is now Afghanistan’s entire government – at all levels – and Afghanistan is an enemy of the United States, Facebook’s home country. If Facebook were serious about keeping guys like this off their services, the most effective way to do so wouldn’t be by playing whack-a-mole with individual government employees, as Facebook does, but rather by banning the entirety of Afghanistan’s IP range and all Afghan phone numbers, and disabling app downloads in-country, which Facebook does not. Facebook chooses the ineffective measures rather than the effective ones.</p>



<p>Yet, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg lives comfortably in an estate in Hawaii, rather than in exile, and presumably doesn’t have a warrant out for his arrest in any country, whereas Durov obviously <em>did</em>. I grant it is possible (even probable, given that Telegram runs on a skeleton crew of <a href="https://yourstory.com/2024/04/telegram-privacy-innovation-controversy">15 engineers</a> and approximately 100 staff worldwide) that Facebook is more responsive to French judicial requests than Telegram. However, when you’re running a globally accessible encrypted platform, it is inevitable – repeat, inevitable, as in an absolute certainty – that criminal activity will take place that is beyond your view or your ability to moderate.</p>



<p>If Telegram stands accused of violating French law because of its failure to moderate, as media reports indicate, an app like Signal – which demonstrably <a href="https://signal.org/bigbrother/cd-california-grand-jury/">cannot respond</a> to law enforcement requests seeking content data and has <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/03/04/signal-app-username-phone-number-privacy/">similar features to Telegram</a> – is guilty, too, and no U.S. social company that offers end-to-end encryption (or its senior leadership) is safe. Do we really think <a href="https://x.com/mer__edith?lang=en">Meredith Whitaker</a> should wind up in prison if she decides to go to France?</p>

<p>Many questions remain. For now, this is not looking good for the future of interactive web services based in Europe. American tech entrepreneurs who run their services in accordance with American values – free speech and privacy through strong encryption, in particular – should not visit Europe, should not hire in Europe, and should not host infrastructure in Europe until this situation is resolved.</p>



<h2>UPDATE, 26 AUGUST 2024</h2>



<p>Basically my hunch was correct:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Finally the charges against Pavel Durov has been published:</p><p>– Complicity – Administration of an online platform to allow an illegal transaction in an organised band,</p><p>– Refusal to communicate, at the request of the authorised authorities, the information or documents necessary… <a href="https://t.co/BZzZ8pAjLL">https://t.co/BZzZ8pAjLL</a> <a href="https://t.co/v3AXM2BS5X">pic.twitter.com/v3AXM2BS5X</a></p></div>— Baptiste Robert (@fs0c131y) <a href="https://twitter.com/fs0c131y/status/1828103712964817389?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>There’s a laundry list of crimes there. Most of them relate to the French crime of <em>complicité</em> which roughly equates to American aider/abettor liability – involving knowingly facilitating, helping or assisting the preparation of a criminal offense, procuring an offense (through a gift, promise, threat, order, or abuse of authority or power) or giving instructions to commit an offense (see <a href="https://www.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/french_penal_code_33.pdf">Articles 121-6 and 121-7</a> of the French <em>Code pénal</em>).</p>



<p>What’s important here is that in the U.S., aider/abettor liability requires a specific intent to bring about the criminal result – that is, the commission of the crime is the defendant’s object. U.S. social media companies simply failing to police their users doesn’t rise to this level, which is why U.S. social media company CEOs don’t, as a general rule, get arrested for the crimes of their users by the American government. The CSAM allegations, in particular, would only rise to the level of a crime in the USA if Durov failed to comply with the notice-and-reporting regime the U.S. has for such content. The simple existence of the criminal content absent any notice doesn’t give rise to criminal liability.</p>



<p>Here, the French government is accusing Durov of being complicit with – i.e. aiding and abetting – criminal activity and also unlicensed provision of “cryptological” software, with encryption products subject to <a href="https://www.at-ica.com/encryption-in-france/">prior government authorization</a> before their use in France will be approved. The list of crimes he’s accused of facilitating includes what appears to be a rough approximation to criminal RICO, CSAM, money laundering, narcotics trafficking, hacking, and providing unlicensed cryptography.</p>



<p>It would make zero sense for Durov to do any of these things with specific intent. For example, intentionally engaging in narcotics trafficking is illegal virtually everywhere on Earth; the crime is punishable by <em>death</em> in the United Arab Emirates, where Durov is a citizen and ordinarily resides, and can attract up to a life term in the United States, which is historically very good at extraditing people.</p>



<p>We’ll need wait for the evidence to come out before reaching any firm conclusions on this point. If I had to guess, in a world where every platform hosts unlawful activity to some extent, this looks like selective enforcement. I would also guess that Durov was not “aiding and abetting” as the U.S. would understand it and that this French enforcement action is an overbroad application of French law to punish a perceived political enemy, with the French security state trying to use local doctrines in a novel way to try to police a foreign company with moderation policies it (and likely each of its security cooperation partners in the EU and across the channel in the UK) regards as too lax.</p>



<p>In the absence of a lot of evidence showing that Durov and Telegram specifically intended to commit these crimes or bring them about, there is no reason why similar charges could not be laid against any other provider of social media services in France whose moderation practices are anything less than perfect, in particular social media services which provide end-to-end encryption. </p>



<p>Summing up: for the time being, if you run a social media company, or if you provide encrypted messaging services, which are accessible in France, and you’re based in the United States, get out of Europe.</p>

<p>A next-generation COVID-19 mucosal vaccine is set to be a gamechanger not only when delivering the vaccine itself, but also for people who are needle-phobic.</p>



<p>New Griffith University research, published in Nature Communications, has been testing the efficacy of delivering a COVID-19 vaccine via the nasal passages.</p>


<div>
<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://news.griffith.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Suresh-Mahalingam-683x1024.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://news.griffith.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Suresh-Mahalingam-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://news.griffith.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Suresh-Mahalingam-200x300.jpg 200w, https://news.griffith.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Suresh-Mahalingam-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://news.griffith.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Suresh-Mahalingam-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://news.griffith.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Suresh-Mahalingam-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://news.griffith.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Suresh-Mahalingam-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"><figcaption><strong>Professor Suresh Mahalingam</strong></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Professor Suresh Mahalingam from Griffith’s Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics and Griffith Health has been working on this research for the past four years.</p>



<p>“This is a live attenuated intranasal vaccine, called CDO-7N-1, designed to be administered intranasally, thereby inducing potential mucosal immunity as well as systemic immunity with just a single dose,” Professor Mahalingam said.</p>



<p>“The vaccine induces strong memory responses in the nasal mucosa offering long-term protection for up to a year or more.</p>



<p>“It’s been designed to be administered as single dose, ideally as a booster vaccine, as a safe alternative to needles with no adverse reactions in the short or long term.”</p>



<p>Live-attenuated vaccines offer several significant advantages over other vaccine approaches.</p>



<p>They induce potent and long-lived humoral and cellular immunity, often with just a single dose.</p>



<p>Live-attenuated vaccines comprise the entire virus thereby providing broad immunity, in contrast to a single antigen which is used in many other vaccine platforms.</p>

<p>Lead author Dr Xiang Liu said the vaccine provides cross-protection against all variants of concern, and has neutralising capacity against SARS-CoV-1.</p>



<p>“The vaccine offers potent protection against transmission, prevents reinfection and the spread of the virus, while also reducing the generation of new variants,” Dr Liu said.</p>



<p>“Unlike the mRNA vaccine which targets only the spike protein, CDO-7N-1 induces immunity to all major SARS-CoV-2 proteins and is highly effective against all major variants to date.</p>



<p>“Importantly, the vaccine remains stable at 4°C for seven months, making it ideal for low- and middle-income countries.”</p>



<p>The vaccine has been licensed to Indian Immunologicals Ltd, a major vaccine manufacturer.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Dr. K. Anand Kumar, co-author of the publication and Managing&nbsp;Director of Indian Immunologicals Ltd. Said: “We are a leading ‘One Health’ company that has developed and launched several vaccines for human and animal use in India and are currently exporting to 62 countries.”</p>



<p>“We have completed all the necessary studies of this novel COVID-19 vaccine which offers tremendous advantages over other vaccines.</p>



<p>“We now look forward to taking the vaccine candidate to clinical&nbsp;trials.”</p>



<p>Professor Lee Smith, Acting Director of the Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics, said he was delighted with the research findings.</p>



<p>“These results towards developing a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine are truly exciting,” Professor Smith said.</p>



<p>“Our researchers are dedicated to providing innovative and, crucially, more accessible solutions to combat this high-impact disease.”</p>



<p>The paper ‘<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51535-y">A single-dose intranasal live-attenuated codon deoptimsed vaccine provides broad protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants</a>’ has been published in Nature Communications.</p>

<p>The Food and Drug Administration has been warning for years that some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/caveat-emptor-90-of-tattoo-inks-have-unlabeled-or-mislabeled-ingredients/">tattoo inks</a> are <a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-recalls-alerts/fda-advises-consumers-tattoo-artists-and-retailers-avoid-using-or-selling-certain-tattoo-inks">brimming with bacteria</a>—a large assortment that, when injected into your skin, can cause inflammatory reactions, allergic hypersensitivity, toxic responses, and, of course, straight-up infections. And, worse yet, the labels that say the inks are sterile are not reliable.</p>
<p>But, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/sierra-stain-recalls-tattoo-pigments-because-possible-health-risk">a recent recall of three tattoo pigments</a> from the same manufacturer does a good job of illustrating the FDA's concerns. The water-based inks, all from Sierra Stain, had a bizarre array of bacteria, which were found at high levels, according to FDA testing.
</p><p>One ink product—described as "Carolina Blue"—offered a microbial menagerie, with six odd species identified. They included a bacterium that often dwells in the gastrointestinal system and can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10909985/">inflame the mucosal lining of the intestines</a> (<em>Citrobacter braakii</em>), a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897476/'">water-borne bacterium</a> (<em>Cupriavidus pauculus</em>), and several that cause opportunistic infections (<em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2849549/">Citrobacter farmer</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6166261/">Achromobacter xylosoxidans</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9499045/">Ochrobactrum anthropi</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4187640/">Pseudomonas fluorescens</a></em>). These are bacteria that don't typically go about attacking humans but will if the conditions are right, including when they find themselves inside a human with a compromised immune system.</p>
<p>An ink called "UV China Pink" contained an unusual soil bacterium (<em>Curtobacterium citreum/pusillum</em>). And an "All Purpose Black" ink puzzlingly contained <em>Acetobacter senegalensis</em>, a bacterium first isolated from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35182093/">mangos in Senegal</a> and used for industrial vinegar production in low-income countries.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The three inks were sold nationwide through Amazon. To date, there have been no reported infections or adverse reactions linked to these inks. But the FDA notes that reactions to contaminated inks can be difficult to accurately diagnose. The infections and skin responses can look like generic rashes and allergic responses, sometimes including lesions with red papules in areas where the ink was injected, the FDA notes. However, infections from tattoo ink can leave permanent scarring.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.00276-24">a study published in July in Applied and Environmental Microbiology</a>, FDA researchers tested 75 samples of tattoo and permanent makeup inks from 14 manufacturers. Of the 75 inks, 26 (35 percent) were contaminated with a total of 34 types of bacteria, many that were possibly disease-causing. Some of the bacteria were anaerobic, meaning they don't need oxygen to grow, suggesting they could thrive in the low-oxygen environment of skin layers. Of the 40 tattoo inks specifically, nine (22 percent) were contaminated. Among all the ink samples, 49 were labeled "sterile" and, of those, 16 (33 percent) were contaminated.</p>
<p>The recall announcement noted that Sierra Stain is no longer in business. While the company lists a remaining email address, it did not immediately respond to a comment request from Ars on the bacteria found in their inks.</p>
<p>The FDA recommends that consumers be vigilant about the quality and safety of tattoo supplies and techniques. It also encourages tattoo artists to work in professional environments that can reduce the risk of contamination.</p>

            <div>
                <p>U.S. Ambassador to Canada David Cohen says Canadians are consuming too much American news, which he believes is “unhealthy” because of American legacy media’s polarizing and partisan nature.</p>
<p>He added that it’s come at the expense of Canadians consuming news about their own country’s politics.</p>
<p>Cohen made the comments during a recent <a href="https://thehub.ca/podcasts/the-united-states-has-no-more-important-friend-partner-or-ally-than-canada-u-s-ambassador-david-cohen-on-canadian-american-relations-trade-protectionism-and-nato-spending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with <em>The Hub’s</em> managing editor, Harrison Lowman.</p>
<p>When asked about Canadians’ apparent obsession and preoccupation with the political news of the United States, Cohen, who is a former Comcast media executive, explained that he finds Canada’s consumption of American news from CNN, MSNBC, and Fox to be somewhat strange.</p>
<p>“I do think it is odd, particularly when I contrast it to the United States, where…virtually no one in the United States is paying any attention to Canadian politics,” he said.</p>
<p>“Every major Canadian household has easy access to American cable television news,” he noted.</p>
<p>“I’ll be honest with you, before I came here…Canadian cable television news outlets, I didn’t even know how to get them in the United States,” he added.</p>
<p>According to new <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2024/canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistics</a> from the Reuters Institute, a significant number of Canadians, particularly in English Canada, rely on American outlets like CNN and the <em>New York Times</em> on a weekly basis for news.</p>
<p>In 2018, Canada was the <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/07/as-the-new-york-times-extends-its-reach-across-countries-and-languages-and-cultures-it-looks-to-locals-for-guidance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest</a> foreign market for the <i>New York Times</i>, making up around 27 percent of its total foreign audience. In an <a href="http://www.canadalandshow.com/podcast/whats-new-york-times-canada/">interview</a> with <i>Canadaland</i>, the then <i>New York Times</i> Canada bureau chief said the paper’s Canadian audience hovered around 94,000.</p>
<p>In 2024, a <i>New York Times </i><a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/the-new-york-times-passes-2m-international-digital-subscribers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> announced the paper had reached two million international subscriptions, highlighting that it has “seen subscriber growth in recent years” in Canada. Some estimates have claimed the <i>New York Times</i> has more paying Canadian digital subscribers than any Canadian news outlet.</p>

                <h4><b>A Canadian fixation with America</b></h4>
<p>Within our borders, Canadian media outlets have also become fixated on American politics.</p>
<p><i>True North</i> reported that Canada’s public broadcaster <i>CBC</i> <a href="https://tnc.news/2024/08/20/cbcs-kamala-mania-68-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> 68 stories about the Kamala Harris campaign in one month. Back in 2020, <i>CBC</i> <a href="https://tnc.news/2020/08/17/500-more-cbc-headlines-about-kamala-harris-than-leslyn-lewis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> 500 percent more stories about Harris than about Leslyn Lewis, a black woman running for federal office in Canada.</p>
<p><i>CBC</i> has also held U.S. election night TV specials for the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/how-to-watch-us-election-cbc-1.5782601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkb3oFIFAXc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016</a> U.S. presidential elections.</p>
<p>“World coverage has been a hallmark of <i>CBC News </i>since the public broadcaster was founded, and we dedicate more resources to international reporting than any other media outlet in Canada,” <i>CBC</i> general manager and editor-in-chief Brodie Fenlon recently <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/editorsblog/why-cbc-news-follows-the-u-s-presidential-election-1.7299084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> in an article justifying the public broadcaster’s coverage of U.S. politics.</p>
<p>“​​Within our coverage of the world, the United States occupies a special place for some obvious reasons,” he added. “From arts and culture, national security, the economy to the environment—our countries are inextricably linked.”</p>
<p>As previously reported by <i>The Hub</i>, Canada’s politics are <a href="https://thehub.ca/2024/08/09/elie-cantin-nantel-trudeaus-liberals-are-americanizing-canadas-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing</a> more and more Americanized.</p>

                <h4><b>Slanted news</b></h4>
<p>Ambassador Cohen said even American outlets themselves have what he considers to be “an unhealthy preoccupation with American politics.”</p>
<p>“You’re getting an unfiltered and 24/7 perspective on the political structure from all of these cable television news outlets, without the balancing perspective of lots of people around you who have different opinions and who can balance a little bit what you’re seeing on a cable television news show,” he explained.</p>
<p>“I do think it’s unhealthy,” said Cohen, admitting that for his own mental health he took an intentional break from his country’s political news channels this summer.</p>
<p>According to media analysts, America’s “Big Three” news channels—<i>Fox News, CNN, </i>and<i> MSNBC</i>—all have political biases.</p>
<p>The AllSides bias checker rates <i>Fox News</i> as having a <a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fox-news-editorial-media-bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right-wing</a> bias, <i>CNN</i> as having a bias that <a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnn-media-bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leans Left</a>, and <i>MSNBC</i> as having a <a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/msnbc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left-wing</a> bias.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many American newsrooms are lacking ideological diversity. According to a <a href="https://www.theamericanjournalist.org/_files/ugd/46a507_4fe1c4d6ec6d4c229895282965258a7a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 Syracuse University study</a>, just 3.4 percent of American journalists now describe themselves as Republicans, while 36.4 percent describe themselves as Democrats.</p>
<p>“I come from Pennsylvania… [which] I think has been properly identified as maybe the battleground state in the upcoming election,” said Cohen. “So I can’t go anywhere in Pennsylvania where I don’t find equal numbers of people who have very different political opinions than what is being carried on <i>MSNBC</i> and, to a large extent, on <i>CNN</i>.”</p>
<p>“It’s just not necessarily an accurate depiction of the political process and the way people think to just get your news and information from cable television news outlets,” he added.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Cohen has spoken about Canada’s massive appetite for American news.</p>
<p>In a July interview with the<i> Hill Times</i>, Cohen <a href="https://www.hilltimes.com/story/2024/07/10/american-envoy-david-cohen-navigates-unaccustomed-hiatus-from-political-arena-as-presidential-vote-looms/427688/">said</a> he believes one of the reasons why Canadians are often anxious about the United States is because of their media consumption.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="Pidgin" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2024/08/27/pidgin-header.jpg" width="1600"></p>
<p>The Pidgin messaging app removed the ScreenShareOTR plugin from its official third-party plugin list after it was discovered that it was used to install keyloggers, information stealers, and malware commonly used to gain initial access to corporate networks.</p>
<p>The plugin was promoted as a screen-sharing tool for secure Off-The-Record (OTR) protocol and was available for both Windows and Linux versions of Pidgin.</p>
<p>According to ESET, the malicious plugin was configured to infect unsuspecting users with <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkgate-and-pikabot-malware-emerge-as-qakbots-successors/" target="_blank">DarkGate malware</a>, a powerful malware threat actors use to breach networks since QBot's dismantling by the authorities.</p>
<h2>Sneaky Pidgin plugin</h2>
<p>Pidgin is an open-source, cross-platform instant messaging client that supports multiple networks and messaging protocols.</p>
<p>Although not as popular as in the mid-2000s when multi-protocol clients were in high demand, it remains a popular choice among those seeking to consolidate their messaging accounts into a single app and has a dedicated user base of tech-savvy individuals, open-source enthusiasts, and users who need to connect to legacy IM systems.</p>
<p>Pidgin operates a plugin system that allows users to extend the program's functionality, enable niche features, and unlock new customization options.</p>
<p>Users can download them from the project's official <a href="https://pidgin.im/plugins/?publisher=all&amp;query=&amp;type=" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">third-party plugins list</a>, currently hosting 211 addons.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://pidgin.im/posts/2024-08-malicious-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">an announcement</a> on the project's website&nbsp;last week, a malicious plugin named 'ss-otr' had slipped into the list on July 6, 2024, and was only pulled on August 16 following a user report about it being a keylogger and screenshot capturing tool.</p>
<div><p>"A plugin, ss-otr, was added to the third party plugins list on July 6th. On August 16th we received a report from 0xFFFC0000 that the plugin contained a key logger and shared screen shots with unwanted parties.</p><p>
We quietly pulled the plugin from the list immediately and started investigating. On August 22nd Johnny Xmas was able to confirm that a keylogger was present." – Pidgin</p></div>
<p>A red flag is that ss-otr only provided binaries for download and not any source code, but due to the lack of robust reviewing mechanisms in Pidgin's third-party plugin repository, nobody questioned its security.</p>
<h2>Plugin leads to DarkGate malware</h2>
<p>ESET <a href="https://x.com/ESETresearch/status/1828114327976415445" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a> the plugin installer is signed with a valid digital certificate issued to <em>INTERREX – SP. Z O.O.</em>, a legitimate Polish company.</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="Signed executable" height="515" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2024/Linux/04/signed.jpg" width="810"><figcaption><strong>Signed executable</strong><br><em>Source: ESET</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The plugin offers the advertised functionality of screen sharing but also contains malicious code, allowing it to download additional binaries from the attacker's server at jabberplugins[.]net.</p>
<p>The downloaded payloads are either PowerShell scripts or the DarkGate malware, which is also signed by an Interrex certificate.</p>
<p>A similar mechanism is implemented for the Linux version of the Pidgin client, so both platforms are covered.</p>
<p>ESET says that the same malicious server, which has been taken down now, hosted additional plugins named OMEMO, Pidgin Paranoia, Master Password, Window Merge, and HTTP File Upload.</p>
<p>These plugins were almost certainly also delivering DarkGate, indicating that ScreenShareOTR was just one small part of a broader-scale campaign.</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="Threat actor's website" height="600" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2024/Linux/04/site.jpg" width="800"><figcaption><strong>Threat actor's website</strong><br><em>Source: ESET</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Those who installed it are recommended to remove it immediately and perform a full system scan with an antivirus tool, as DarkGate may be lurking on their system.</p>
<p>After publishing our story, Pidgin's maintainer and lead developer, Gary Kramlich, <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@grimmy@mastodon.social/113035335884182662" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">notified us on Mastodon</a> to say that they do not keep track of how many times a plugin is installed.</p>
<p>To prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, Pidgin announced that, from now on, it will only accept third-party plugins that have an OSI Approved Open Source License, allowing scrutiny into their code and internal functionality.</p>
<p><em>Update 8/27/24: Updated story to note that Pidgin does not keep track of plugin downloads.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span data-contrast="auto">Cerebras inference is designed to serve models from billions to trillions of parameters. When models exceed the memory capacity of a single wafer, we split them at layer boundaries and map them to multiple CS-3 systems. 20B models fit on a single CS-3 while 70B models fit on as few as four systems. In the weeks to come we will be adding larger models such as Llama3-405B and Mistral Large with industry leading speed and cost per token.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>16-bit model weights for the highest accuracy</h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some companies try to overcome the memory bandwidth bottleneck by reducing weight precision from 16-bit to 8-bit, often without informing their users. This approach, however, can result in loss of accuracy. Cerebras inference runs Llama3.1 8B and 70B models using the original 16-bit weights released by Meta, ensuring the most accurate and reliable model output. Our evaluations, along with third-party benchmarks, show that 16-bit models score up to 5% higher than their 8-bit counterparts, resulting in substantially better performance in multi-turn conversations, math, and reasoning tasks.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Cerebras Inference API</h3>
</div><p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span>Cerebras</span><span> inference is available today via </span></span><a href="http://link/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">chat</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span> and </span></span><a href="http://link/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">API</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span> access. Built on the familiar OpenAI Chat Completions format, it allows developers to integrate our powerful inference capabilities by simply swapping out the API key. </span><span>Cerebras</span><span> inference API offers some of the most generous rate limits in the industry at </span><span>60 tokens per minute and </span><span>1</span><span> million tokens per day</span><span>, making it the ideal platform for AI developers to </span><span>built</span><span> interactive and agentic applications.</span></span></p><div><p><span data-contrast="auto">Cerebras inference API offers the best combination of performance, speed, accuracy and cost. At 450 tokens per second, it’s the only solution that runs Llama3.1-70B at instantaneous speed. We use Meta’s original 16-bit model weights, ensuring the highest accuracy. For launch we are providing developers with 1 million free tokens daily. For at scale deployments, our pricing is a fraction of popular GPU clouds.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For initial launch, we are offering Llama3.1 8B and 70B models. We will be adding support for larger models such as Llama3 405B and Mistral Large 2 in the coming weeks. Please let us know what models you’d like to see added.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Why fast inference matters</h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The implications of high-speed inference extend far beyond raw metrics. By dramatically reducing processing time, we’re enabling more complex AI workflows and enhancing real-time LLM intelligence. Traditional LLMs output everything they think immediately, without stopping to consider the best possible answer. New techniques like scaffolding, on the other hand, function like a thoughtful agent who explores different possible solutions before deciding. This “thinking before speaking” approach provides over 10x performance on demanding tasks like code generation, fundamentally boosting the intelligence of AI models without additional training. But these techniques require up to 100x more tokens at runtime, and thus is only possible in real time running on Cerebras hardware.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With record-breaking performance, industry-leading pricing, and open API access, Cerebras Inference sets a new standard for open LLM development and deployment. As the only solution capable of delivering both high-speed training and inference, Cerebras opens entirely new capabilities for AI. We can’t wait to see the new and exciting applications developers will build with Cerebras Inference.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}">&nbsp;</span></p>
