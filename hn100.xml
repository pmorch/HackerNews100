<p>Owners of Spotify's soon-to-be-bricked Car Thing device are begging the company to open-source the gadgets to save some the landfill. Spotify hasn't responded to pleas to salvage the hardware, which was originally intended to connect to car dashboards and auxiliary outlets to enable drivers to listen to and navigate Spotify.</p>
<p>Spotify announced today that it's bricking all purchased Car Things on December 9 and not offering refunds or trade-in options. On a <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/car-thing-discontinued/">support page</a>, Spotify says:</p>
<blockquote><p>We're discontinuing Car Thing as part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our product offerings. We understand it may be disappointing, but this decision allows us to focus on developing new features and enhancements that will ultimately provide a better experience to all Spotify users.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spotify has no further guidance for device owners beyond asking them to reset the device to factory settings and “safely” get rid of the bricked gadget by “following local electronic waste guidelines.”</p>
<p>The company also said that it doesn’t plan to release a follow-up to the Car Thing.</p>
<h2>Early demise</h2>
<p>Car Thing came out to limited subscribers in October 2021 before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/02/spotify-car-thing-is-a-90-thing-that-plays-spotify-in-your-car/">releasing to the general public</a> in February 2022.</p>
<p>In its Q2 2022 earnings report released in July, Spotify revealed that it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/spotify-is-no-longer-making-its-car-thing-music-player/">stopped making Car Things. </a>In a chat with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/27/spotify-exits-short-lived-car-thing-hardware-play-as-reports-q2-maus-of-433m-offsetting-russia-exit-and-service-outage/">TechCrunch</a>, it cited "several factors, including product demand and supply chain issues." A Spotify rep also told the publication that the devices would continue to “perform as intended,” but that was apparently a temporary situation.</p>
<p>Halted production was a warning sign that Car Thing was in peril. However, at that time, Spotify also cut the device’s price from $90 to $50, which could have encouraged people to buy a device that would be useless a few years later.</p>
<p>Car Thing's usefulness was always dubious, though. The device has a 4-inch touchscreen and knob for easy navigation, as well as support for Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and voice control. But it also required users to subscribe to Spotify Premium, which starts at $11 per month. Worse, Car Thing requires a phone using data or Wi-Fi connected via Bluetooth in order to work, making the Thing seem redundant.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In its Q1 2022 report, Spotify said that quitting Car Thing hurt gross margins and that it took a 31 million euro (about $31.4 million at the time) hit on the venture.</p>
<h2>Open source pleas</h2>
<p>Spotify's announcement has sent some Car Thing owners to online forums to share their disappointment with Spotify and beg the company to open-source the device instead of dooming it for recycling centers at best. As of this writing, there are over 50 posts on the <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?advanced=false&amp;allow_punctuation=false&amp;q=car%20thing">Spotify Community</a> forums showing concern about the discontinuation, with many demanding a refund and/or calling for open-sourcing. There are similar discussions happening elsewhere online, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CarThing/">like on Reddit</a>, where users have used phrases like "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/1cyx5fs/comment/l5ckxkv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">entirely unnacceptable</a>" to describe the news.</p>
<p>A Spotify Community member going by AaronMickDee, for example, <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/With-Car-Thing-being-sunsetted-would-you-open-source-the-device/idi-p/6088742">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I'd rather not just dispose of the device. I think there is a community that would love the idea of having a device we can customize and use for other uses other than a song playback device.</p>
<p>Would Spotify be willing to maybe unlock the system and allow users to write/flash 3rd party firmware to the device?</p></blockquote>
<p>A Spotify spokesperson declined to answer Ars' questions about why Car Thing isn't being open-sourced and concerns around e-waste and wasted money.</p>
<p>Instead, a company rep told Ars, in part: “The goal of our Car Thing exploration in the US was to learn more about how people listen in the car. <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-07-27/spotify-reports-second-quarter-2022-earnings/">In July 2022,</a> we announced we’d stop further production and now it’s time to say goodbye to the devices entirely." I followed up with Spotify's rep to ask again about making the device open source but didn't hear back.</p>
<p>At this point, encouraging customers to waste nearly $100 on a soon-obsolete device hasn't resulted in any groundbreaking innovations or lessons around "how people listen in the car." In their initial response, Spotify's rep pointed me to a <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/?s=how+to+listen+to+spotify+in+the+car">Spotify site</a> that searches Spotify's newsroom for "how to listen to Spotify in the car." One of the <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-08-26/how-to-listen-to-spotify-in-the-car/">top posts </a>is from 2019 and states that “if your car has an AUX or USB socket, using a cable is probably one of the fastest ways to connect by using your phone."</p>
<p>As for Spotify, using customer dollars for company-serving learning experiences isn't the best business plan. And for regular users, it's best to avoid investing in an unproven hardware venture from a software company.</p>
<p>As Redditor Wemie1420 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CarThing/comments/1cywpze/comment/l5ccejb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">put it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Doesn’t feel great that there is literally no alternative other than trashing it. Feels like we’re being punished for supporting them. Dissuades me from buying anything Spotify puts out in the future. I feel like there would be some way to approach this without being like, 'yeah we’re done. Just throw it out it’s a waste of money now.'</p></blockquote>

    <span>Part 1: Defining the problem</span><!--]--></h2><p><!--[-->From Mario bouncing off a Goomba to two cars bumping into each other in a racing
game, dealing with collisions is such an integral part of most video games that
we often take it for granted.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In this series of blog posts, I want to show you what actually goes on behind the
scenes in a physics simulation like the one above.
While we're going to look at this through the lens video games, this post is
really about the actual math and physics of collisions.
Video games are just a nice way to contextualize these concepts and help make
things a little less abstract.<!--]--></p><div><p>A word about math</p><!--[--><p><!--[-->While these articles will involve a fair bit of math, please don't be discouraged
by that if you don't consider yourself to be a "math person".
I think this kind of thinking is harmful and actively prevents you from engaging
with topics that you might actually enjoy!<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Many times, it's the math <em><!--[-->notation<!--]--></em> that makes things look more complicated
than they actually are because it's so information-dense and unfamiliar.
Most of the math in these articles will be fairly straight-forward arithmetic
but dressed up to look fancy!<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->This is something that's really dear to my heart.
I think too many people have this instinctive reaction of
<em><!--[-->"I'm not smart enough to understand this"<!--]--></em> whenever they see any kind of math
notation.
While I can definitely empathize with this, I encourage you to fight this
reaction because at some point it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.<!--]--></p><!--]--></div><h2 id="before-we-start"><a href="#before-we-start"><!--[-->Before we start<!--]--></a></h2><p><!--[-->Let's set our expectations and define a few terms.<!--]--></p><h3 id="rigid-bodies"><a href="#rigid-bodies"><!--[-->Rigid bodies<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->The specific kind of physics simulation we are going to cover is called
<strong><!--[-->rigid body physics<!--]--></strong>.
A <strong><!--[-->rigid body<!--]--></strong> is a body that does not deform when subjected to forces.
This is an idealized model because true rigid bodies do not exist in the real
world; everything deforms on the molecular level even if this deformation
is not visible to the naked eye.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->For most physics simulations, trying to simulate this level of detail is not
only extremely difficult (if not flat out impossible) and computationally
expensive, it's also unnecessary.
As long as our bodies behave realistically, we're allowed to simplify as much
as we want.
Rigid bodies are one such simplification.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->This might sound a little abstract at the moment but will hopefully start to
make sense as we work through our examples.<!--]--></p><h3 id="collision-detection-vs-collision-resolution"><a href="#collision-detection-vs-collision-resolution"><!--[-->Collision detection vs. collision resolution<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->In a video game engine, dealing with collisions can be broken down into two
distinct phases: <strong><!--[-->collision detection<!--]--></strong> and <strong><!--[-->collision resolution<!--]--></strong>.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Collision detection is about determining which bodies in our scene are
colliding.
This usually involves a bunch of geometry to check if two shapes are
intersecting or overlapping.
Depending on how many objects there are in our scene, this can be quite
computationally expensive and is usually heavily optimized.
The result of this step is then used in the collision resolution step.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Collision resolution is the process of figuring out what needs to happen to
two colliding bodies based on things like their current movement directions,
speeds, materials, and many other things.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In this series of blog posts, we're only looking at the <strong><!--[-->collision resolution<!--]--></strong>
phase as this where all the interesting physics happens.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Ok, enough preamble. Let's get started!<!--]--></p><h2 id="what-are-we-trying-to-do"><a href="#what-are-we-trying-to-do"><!--[-->What are we trying to do?<!--]--></a></h2><p><!--[-->Let's start out by trying to define the problem we're trying to solve.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Most games run in a big loop. In order to make things move on the screen, the
game engine needs to continually calculate the positions of the various objects
in the scene.
So on each iteration of the game loop, the position of each of object
gets updated a tiny amount based on its current <strong><!--[-->velocity<!--]--></strong>.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Velocity is a vector quantity, meaning it has both a magnitude and a direction.
We can represent an object's current velocity with an arrow where the length of
the arrow represents the object's current speed and the direction the arrow
is pointing its travel direction.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In the demonstration below, you can change the box's
<strong><!--[--><span>velocity</span><!--]--></strong> by dragging the <strong><!--[--><span>arrow</span><!--]--></strong> around.

In physics, this change in position is called <strong><!--[-->displacement<!--]--></strong> and is usually

this means that the variable is a vector.

continued with the next iteration of our game loop.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In this case, the physics engine would update each objects' positions as usual

This would cause the objects to penetrate each other and eventually pass through

What are these laws?
Well, that's what the majority of this series of articles is going to be about!<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->To start, let's try defining what a collision is a little more rigorously.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Take a look at the scene below.
This scene shows two bodies on a specific frame of our game.
We can see that the bodies are touching, but are they <em><!--[-->colliding<!--]--></em>?<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In the last section we learned that two bodies are said to be colliding if
continuing to move them along their current velocities would cause them to
penetrate each other.
So, with the information we've been given, can we actually determine if the
scene above depicts a collision or not?<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->We can't!
All we know is that the bodies are touching.
We haven't been given any information about their velocities.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->To see why this matters, take a look at the demonstration below.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->You can change the velocities of the bodies by dragging the
<strong><!--[--><span>arrows</span><!--]--></strong> around.
The indicator tells you if the current configuration would lead to a
<span>collision</span>
or <span>no&nbsp;collision</span>.
You can verify the result by playing the simulation.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->We can see that depending on the velocities of the bodies, the same scene can
either represent a collision or not.<!--]--></p><div><p>That doesn't look right</p><!--[--><p><!--[-->You might have noticed that the way the two boxes bounce off each other looks
a little strange.
This is because, in order to keep things simple for now, we're not yet
making the boxes spin when they hit each other.
Don't worry we'll add that in a later post, but let's try and keep the
complexity to a minimum for now.<!--]--></p><!--]--></div><h3 id="towards-a-definition"><a href="#towards-a-definition"><!--[-->Towards a definition<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->In order for two bodies to be colliding, two conditions have to be met:<!--]--></p><ol><!--[--><li><!--[-->The bodies' geometries have to be touching or overlapping<!--]--></li><li><!--[-->The bodies are still moving <em><!--[-->towards the collision<!--]--></em><!--]--></li><!--]--></ol><p><!--[-->Let's assume that point 1 is true for now and focus on point 2, instead.
What does it mean for two bodies to be moving "towards the collision"?
This seems like a pretty circular definition.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Instead of asking what it means to move towards the collision, let's ask what it
means to move <em><!--[-->away<!--]--></em> from the collision.
In fact, let's ignore collisions entirely for a moment.
What does it mean to move away from a <em><!--[-->surface<!--]--></em>?<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->The image below shows a box sitting on the floor.
What direction would you have to move the box in order to move it away from the
floor?<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->At first glance, this seems like a silly question.
Obviously, we'd have to move the box <em><!--[-->up<!--]--></em>.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->However, there are an infinite number of directions that we could move the box!
As long as we are moving it <em><!--[-->generally<!--]--></em> upwards, we are increasing the distance
between the box and the floor.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Notice that while the box was moved the exact same distance in each
direction—that is, the length of the <strong><!--[--><span>arrows</span><!--]--></strong> is the
same—some of the boxes are clearly further away from the floor than others.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->So, are some of these directions more "up" than others?
Is there a direction that is <em><!--[-->most<!--]--></em> "up"?<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->To explore this idea, let's play a little game.<!--]--></p><h3 id="surface-normals"><a href="#surface-normals"><!--[-->Surface normals<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->You are given a box sitting on the floor.
Your goal is to move the box so that its distance to the floor is as close as
possible to the total distance the box was moved.
It doesn't matter how far you move the box, just that these two distances are
as close to each other as possible.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->To make things a little more challenging, the angle of inclination of the floor
is going to change every time you reset the game.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->I know, I know, Game of the Year material right here.
But hopefully you were able to figure out that the direction that maximizes the
distance between the box and the floor is the direction that is <em><!--[-->perpendicular<!--]--></em>
to the floor, which isn't necessarily straight up!<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->This direction is called the <strong><!--[-->normal direction<!--]--></strong>, often referred to as simply
the <strong><!--[-->normal<!--]--></strong> of the surface.
The normal direction of a surface is always perpendicular to the surface.
It is the direction that points <em><!--[-->directly away<!--]--></em> from the surface.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Normal directions are represented with a <strong><!--[-->normalized vector<!--]--></strong>; that is, a
vector with length <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.
A vector with length <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is also called a <strong><!--[-->unit vector<!--]--></strong>.
To make it clear that a vector is normalized, we often add a little hat on top
of the variable like this <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mover accent="true"><mi>n</mi><mo>^</mo></mover></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\hat{n}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->If our surface is perfectly straight, the normal direction is the same
everywhere on the surface.
However, if the surface is curved, the normal direction will be different for
each point on the surface.
The easiest way to demonstrate this is with a circle.
If we stick with the idea that the normal direction points directly away from
a surface, then the normal direction for any point on the circle's circumference
is the direction from the center of the circle to that point.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->More generally, the <strong><!--[--><span>normal</span><!--]--></strong> direction for a point on a
surface is perpendicular to the <strong><!--[--><span>tangent</span><!--]--></strong> of the surface
at that point.<!--]--></p><!--[--><!--]--><p><!--[-->We saw earlier that it isn't necessary to move the box <em><!--[-->directly<!--]--></em> in the normal
direction in order to move it away from the floor.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->What all these directions have in common, is that they all generally point in
the same direction as the surface normal.
We say that these directions have <em><!--[-->some component in the normal direction<!--]--></em>.
Let's take a closer look at what this means, exactly.<!--]--></p><h3 id="the-dot-product"><a href="#the-dot-product"><!--[-->The dot product<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->To calculate how much of one vector is pointing in the same direction as another
vector, we can use the <strong><!--[-->dot product<!--]--></strong> of the two vectors.
In our example, the two vectors are the direction we move the box and the
surface normal.
The dot product between two vectors <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mover accent="true"><mi>a</mi><mo>⃗</mo></mover></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\vec{a}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> and

this as:<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Note that the result of the dot product is a <em><!--[-->scalar<!--]--></em>, not another vector.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->While this is fairly straight-forward to calculate, it's not exactly obvious
what this scalar <em><!--[-->represents<!--]--></em>.
Luckily, there is also a geometric interpretation of the dot product that can be
visualized nicely.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Say we have two vectors <strong><!--[--><span>a</span><!--]--></strong> and <strong><!--[--><span>b</span><!--]--></strong> that
have some angle <strong><!--[--><span>θ</span><!--]--></strong> between them.<!--]--></p><!--[--><!----><!--]--><p><!--[-->Next, starting from the tip of <strong><!--[--><span>a</span><!--]--></strong> let's draw a line

two vectors.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->To be precise, it's the <em><!--[-->absolute value<!--]--></em> of the scalar projection that gives us
the length of the shadow, since we will see in a moment that the scalar

Why are we suddenly talking about the <em><!--[-->unit vector in the direction of

The only difference between them is their length.

As long as the velocity vector of the body has some component in the normal

What's our surface and its corresponding normal?
What we're looking for is called the <em><!--[-->collision normal<!--]--></em>.
Unfortunately, the way you calculate the collision normal depends on the shapes
(or geometries) of the colliding bodies, so I can't just show you a single
formula.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->What we're dealing with is called a <em><!--[-->vertex-edge collision<!--]--></em>.
In this type of collision, a point (or vertex) on one body collides with a
side (or edge) of another body.
We'll talk more about collision normals when we take a look at the forces that
act during the collision.
For now, you'll have to take my word that in a vertex-edge collision, the
collision normal is perpendicular to the edge.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In our example, the <strong><!--[--><span>collision normal</span><!--]--></strong> looks like this:<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->If we label our bodies <strong><!--[-->a<!--]--></strong> and <strong><!--[-->b<!--]--></strong>, by convention, the collision normal

consistent throughout our calculations.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Based on what we learned about surface normals earlier, the

determine if the bodies are moving towards the collision or not.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->We'll call this value the <em><!--[-->relative normal velocity<!--]--></em>.
It is the component of the relative velocity in the direction of the collision
normal.
For now, we only care about the sign of the relative normal velocity, but we'll
see later on that it plays an important part in calculating the forces that act
during the collision.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Using our understanding of the dot product, we can say that<!--]--></p><ul><!--[--><li><!--[-->if the relative normal velocity is <strong><!--[-->positive<!--]--></strong>, the bodies are already

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2><a id="user-content-overview" aria-label="Permalink: Overview" href="#overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Perplexica is an open-source AI-powered searching tool or an AI-powered search engine that goes deep into the internet to find answers. Inspired by Perplexity AI, it's an open-source option that not just searches the web but understands your questions. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms like similarity searching and embeddings to refine results and provides clear answers with sources cited.</p>
<p dir="auto">Using SearxNG to stay current and fully open source, Perplexica ensures you always get the most up-to-date information without compromising your privacy.</p>
<p dir="auto">Want to know more about its architecture and how it works? You can read it <a href="https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/architecture/README.md">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Preview</h2><a id="user-content-preview" aria-label="Permalink: Preview" href="#preview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/blob/master/.assets/perplexica-preview.gif"><img src="https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/raw/master/.assets/perplexica-preview.gif" alt="video-preview" data-animated-image=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Local LLMs</strong>: You can make use local LLMs such as Llama3 and Mixtral using Ollama.</li>
<li><strong>Two Main Modes:</strong>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Copilot Mode:</strong> (In development) Boosts search by generating different queries to find more relevant internet sources. Like normal search instead of just using the context by SearxNG, it visits the top matches and tries to find relevant sources to the user's query directly from the page.</li>
<li><strong>Normal Mode:</strong> Processes your query and performs a web search.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Focus Modes:</strong> Special modes to better answer specific types of questions. Perplexica currently has 6 focus modes:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>All Mode:</strong> Searches the entire web to find the best results.</li>
<li><strong>Writing Assistant Mode:</strong> Helpful for writing tasks that does not require searching the web.</li>
<li><strong>Academic Search Mode:</strong> Finds articles and papers, ideal for academic research.</li>
<li><strong>YouTube Search Mode:</strong> Finds YouTube videos based on the search query.</li>
<li><strong>Wolfram Alpha Search Mode:</strong> Answers queries that need calculations or data analysis using Wolfram Alpha.</li>
<li><strong>Reddit Search Mode:</strong> Searches Reddit for discussions and opinions related to the query.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Current Information:</strong> Some search tools might give you outdated info because they use data from crawling bots and convert them into embeddings and store them in a index. Unlike them, Perplexica uses SearxNG, a metasearch engine to get the results and rerank and get the most relevant source out of it, ensuring you always get the latest information without the overhead of daily data updates.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">It has many more features like image and video search. Some of the planned features are mentioned in <a href="#upcoming-features">upcoming features</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are mainly 2 ways of installing Perplexica - With Docker, Without Docker. Using Docker is highly recommended.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)</h3><a id="user-content-getting-started-with-docker-recommended" aria-label="Permalink: Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)" href="#getting-started-with-docker-recommended"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Clone the Perplexica repository:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git"><pre>git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">After cloning, navigate to the directory containing the project files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Rename the <code>sample.config.toml</code> file to <code>config.toml</code>. For Docker setups, you need only fill in the following fields:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>OPENAI</code>: Your OpenAI API key. <strong>You only need to fill this if you wish to use OpenAI's models</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>OLLAMA</code>: Your Ollama API URL. You should enter it as <code>http://host.docker.internal:PORT_NUMBER</code>. If you installed Ollama on port 11434, use <code>http://host.docker.internal:11434</code>. For other ports, adjust accordingly. <strong>You need to fill this if you wish to use Ollama's models instead of OpenAI's</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>GROQ</code>: Your Groq API key. <strong>You only need to fill this if you wish to use Groq's hosted models</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: You can change these after starting Perplexica from the settings dialog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>SIMILARITY_MEASURE</code>: The similarity measure to use (This is filled by default; you can leave it as is if you are unsure about it.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Ensure you are in the directory containing the <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> file and execute:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Wait a few minutes for the setup to complete. You can access Perplexica at <a href="http://localhost:3000/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:3000</a> in your web browser.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: After the containers are built, you can start Perplexica directly from Docker without having to open a terminal.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Non-Docker Installation</h3><a id="user-content-non-docker-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Non-Docker Installation" href="#non-docker-installation"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Clone the repository and rename the <code>sample.config.toml</code> file to <code>config.toml</code> in the root directory. Ensure you complete all required fields in this file.</li>
<li>Rename the <code>.env.example</code> file to <code>.env</code> in the <code>ui</code> folder and fill in all necessary fields.</li>
<li>After populating the configuration and environment files, run <code>npm i</code> in both the <code>ui</code> folder and the root directory.</li>
<li>Install the dependencies and then execute <code>npm run build</code> in both the <code>ui</code> folder and the root directory.</li>
<li>Finally, start both the frontend and the backend by running <code>npm run start</code> in both the <code>ui</code> folder and the root directory.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: Using Docker is recommended as it simplifies the setup process, especially for managing environment variables and dependencies.</p>
<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/installation">installation documentation</a> for more information like exposing it your network, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ollama connection errors</h3><a id="user-content-ollama-connection-errors" aria-label="Permalink: Ollama connection errors" href="#ollama-connection-errors"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you're facing an Ollama connection error, it is often related to the backend not being able to connect to Ollama's API. How can you fix it? You can fix it by updating your Ollama API URL in the settings menu to the following:</p>
<p dir="auto">On Windows: <code>http://host.docker.internal:11434</code><br>
On Mac: <code>http://host.docker.internal:11434</code><br>
On Linux: <code>http://private_ip_of_computer_hosting_ollama:11434</code></p>
<p dir="auto">You need to edit the ports accordingly.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using as a Search Engine</h2><a id="user-content-using-as-a-search-engine" aria-label="Permalink: Using as a Search Engine" href="#using-as-a-search-engine"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you wish to use Perplexica as an alternative to traditional search engines like Google or Bing, or if you want to add a shortcut for quick access from your browser's search bar, follow these steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Open your browser's settings.</li>
<li>Navigate to the 'Search Engines' section.</li>
<li>Add a new site search with the following URL: <code>http://localhost:3000/?q=%s</code>. Replace <code>localhost</code> with your IP address or domain name, and <code>3000</code> with the port number if Perplexica is not hosted locally.</li>
<li>Click the add button. Now, you can use Perplexica directly from your browser's search bar.</li>

On Thursday, </span><em>Rolling Stone</em><span> published an equally brilliant story about how the video game “Cyberpunk 2077” helped him work through his battle with cancer. If you have the time, please check it out.</span></p><blockquote><p>In 2022, like many gamers, Gene Park booted up Cyberpunk 2077, the latest open-world RPG. The futuristic video game by the makers of The Witcher depicts a world full of neon lights and cybernetic enhancements, and it had recently received a big content update. Controller in hand, Park vividly recalls directing a digital Keanu Reeves to try and stop a murder, all while medical tubes protruded from his body. The tubes plugged into a port on his torso, and they were ready to pump chemicals inside. Unlike the digital augments that buffed his video game character, chemotherapy is corrosive in a way that makes the experience invasive, even as it was helping. Park likens it to having poison being poured into his heart.</p></blockquote><p><span>A new poll conducted by Harris for </span><em>The Guardian</em><span> found that the American public is widely misinformed about the economy. This is a pretty damning indictment of the news media, generally.</span></p><blockquote><p>Nearly three in five Americans wrongly believe the US is in an economic recession, and the majority blame the Biden administration, according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. The survey found persistent pessimism about the economy as election day draws closer.</p><p>The poll highlighted many misconceptions people have about the economy, including:</p><ul><li><p>55% believe the economy is shrinking, and 56% think the US is experiencing a recession, though the broadest measure of the economy, gross domestic product (GDP), has been growing.</p></li><li><p>49% believe the S&amp;P 500 stock market index is down for the year, though the index went up about 24% in 2023 and is up more than 12% this year.</p></li><li><p>49% believe that unemployment is at a 50-year high, though the unemployment rate has been under 4%, a near 50-year low.</p></li></ul><p>Many Americans put the blame on Biden for the state of the economy, with 58% of those polled saying the economy is worsening due to mismanagement from the presidential administration.</p></blockquote><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.readtpa.com/p/googles-ai-generated-search-results-9e1?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.readtpa.com/p/googles-ai-generated-search-results-9e1?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.laura-bassett.com/p/why-the-alito-flag-story-matters" rel="">“Why the Alito Flag Story Matters”</a><span> (</span></p><span>, </span><span>, 5/23/24)</span></li><li><p><a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/new-hampshire-repeals-several-protections" rel="">“New Hampshire Legislature Repeals Several Protections Barring Trans Discrimination”</a><span> (</span></p><span>, </span><span>, 5/23/24)</span></li><li><p><a href="https://www.discourseblog.com/p/private-equity-is-ruining-my-weekends" rel="">“Private Equity is Ruining My Weekends”</a><span> (</span></p><span>, </span><span>, 5/22/24) </span></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01468-9?utm_source=bluesky&amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=CONR_JRNLS_AWA1_GL_PCOM_SMEDA_NATUREPORTFOLIO" rel="">“Harassment of scientists is surging — institutions aren’t sure how to help”</a><span> (</span><em>Nature</em><span>, Bianca Nogrady, 5/21/24)</span></p></li></ul></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

In the “mind” of Claude, we found millions of concepts that activate when the model reads relevant text or sees relevant images, which we call “features”.</p><p>One of those was the concept of the Golden Gate Bridge. We found that there’s a specific combination of neurons in Claude’s neural network that activates when it encounters a mention (or a picture) of this most famous San Francisco landmark.</p><p>Not only can we identify these features, we can tune the strength of their activation up or down, and identify corresponding changes in Claude’s behavior.</p><p>And as we <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/index.html#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20we%20see%20that%20clamping%20the%20Golden%20Gate%20Bridge%20feature%2034M/31164353%20to%2010%C3%97%20its%20maximum%20activation%20value%20induces%20thematically%2Drelated%20model%20behavior">explain in our research paper</a>, when we turn up the strength of the “Golden Gate Bridge” feature, Claude’s responses begin to focus on the Golden Gate Bridge. Its replies to most queries start to mention the Golden Gate Bridge, even if it’s not directly relevant.</p><p>If you ask this “Golden Gate Claude” how to spend $10, it will recommend using it to drive across the Golden Gate Bridge and pay the toll. If you ask it to write a love story, it’ll tell you a tale of a car who can’t wait to cross its beloved bridge on a foggy day. If you ask it what it imagines it looks like, it will likely tell you that it imagines it looks like the Golden Gate Bridge.</p><p>For a short time, we’re making this model available for everyone to interact with. You can talk to “Golden Gate Claude” on <a href="https://claude.ai/">claude.ai</a> (just click the Golden Gate logo on the right-hand side). Please bear in mind that this is a research demonstration only, and that this particular model might behave in some unexpected—even jarring—ways.</p><p>Our goal is to let people see the impact our interpretability work can have. The fact that we can find and alter these features within Claude makes us more confident that we’re beginning to understand how large language models really work. This isn’t a matter of asking the model verbally to do some play-acting, or of adding a new “system prompt” that attaches extra text to every input, telling Claude to pretend it’s a bridge. Nor is it traditional “fine-tuning,” where we use extra training data to create a new black box that tweaks the behavior of the old black box. This is a precise, surgical change to some of the most basic aspects of the model’s internal activations.</p><p><a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/index.html">As we describe in our paper</a>, we can use these same techniques to change the strength of <em>safety-related</em> features—like those related to dangerous computer code, criminal activity, or deception. With further research, we believe this work could help make AI models safer.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<h5>Abstract</h5>
<p>This piece analyzes a covert Manhattan Project spin-off organization referred to here as the Manhattan-Rochester Coalition, and an obscure aerosol study in St. Louis, Missouri, conducted under contract by the U.S. military from 1953-1954, and 1963-1965. The military-sponsored studies targeted a segregated, high-density urban area, where low-income persons of color predominantly resided. Examination of the Manhattan-Rochester Coalition and the St. Louis aerosol studies, reveal their connections to each other, and to a vast military project that emerged from the Manhattan Project, that secretly tested humans, both alive and deceased, in an effort to develop and understand the health and environmental effects of weaponized radiation. Through this case study, the author explores how a large number of participants inside an organization will willingly participate in organizational acts that are harmful to others, and how large numbers of outsiders, who may or may not be victims of organizational activities, are unable to determine illegal or harmful activity by an organization. The author explains how ethical and observational lapses are engineered by the organization through several specific mechanisms, in an effort to disable critical analysis, and prevent both internal and external dissent. Through studying the process of complex organizational deviance, we can develop public policies that protect the public's right to know, and construct checks and methods to minimize the chance of covert projects that are contrary to societal norms.</p>

<p>Gordon Moore’s famous prediction about computing power must count as one of the most astonishingly accurate forecasts in history. But it may also have been badly misunderstood — in a way that now looks like a near-catastrophic missed opportunity. If we had grasped the details behind Moore’s Law in the 1980s, we could be living with an abundance of clean energy by now. We fumbled it. </p>



<p>A refresher on Moore’s Law: in 1965, electronics engineer Gordon Moore published an article noting that the number of components that could efficiently be put on an integrated circuit was roughly doubling every year. “Over the short term this rate can be expected to continue, if not increase,” he wrote. “There is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly constant for at least 10 years. That means, by 1975, the number of components per integrated circuit for minimum cost will be 65,000.” </p>



<p>That component number is now well into the billions. Moore adjusted his prediction in 1975 to doubling every two years, and the revised law has remained broadly true ever since, not only for the density of computer components but for the cost, speed and power consumption of computation itself. The question is, why? </p>



<p>The way Moore formulated the law, it was just something that happened: the sun rises and sets, the leaves that are green turn to brown, and computers get faster and cheaper. </p>



<p>But there’s another way to describe technological progress, and it might be better if we talked less about Moore’s Law, and more about Wright’s Law. Theodore Wright was an aeronautical engineer who, in the 1930s, published a Moore-like observation about aeroplanes: they were getting cheaper in a predictable way. Wright found that the second of any particular model of aeroplane would be 20 per cent cheaper to make than the first, the fourth would be 20 per cent cheaper than the second, and every time cumulative production doubled, the cost of making an additional unit would drop by a further 20 per cent. </p>



<p>A key difference is that Moore’s Law is a function of time, but Wright’s Law is a function of activity: the more you make, the cheaper it gets. What’s more, Wright’s Law applies to a huge range of technologies: what varies is the 20 per cent figure. Some technologies resist cost improvements. Others, such as solar photovoltaic modules, become much cheaper as production ramps up. </p>



<p>In a new book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3UAE3Jp">Making Sense of Chaos</a>, the complexity scientist Doyne Farmer points out that both Moore’s Law and Wright’s Law provide a good basis for forecasting the costs of different technologies. Both nicely describe the patterns that we see in the data. But which one is closer to identifying the underlying causes of these patterns? Moore’s Law suggests that products get cheaper over time, and because they are cheaper they then are demanded and produced in larger quantities. Wright’s Law suggests that rather than falling costs spurring production, it’s mass production that causes costs to fall. </p>



<p>And therein lies the missed opportunity. We acted as though Moore’s Law governed the cost of photovoltaics. While there were of course subsidies for solar PV in countries such as Germany, the default view was that it was too expensive to be much use as a large-scale power source, so we should wait and hope that it would eventually become cheap. If instead we had looked through the lens of Wright’s Law, governments should have been falling over themselves to buy or otherwise subsidise expensive solar PV, because the more we bought, the faster the price would fall. </p>



<p>PV is now so cheap that the question is moot. Yet if we had acted more boldly 40 years ago, solar PV might have been cheap enough to put fossil fuels out of business at the turn of the millennium. </p>



<p>That, of course, presupposes that Wright’s Law really does apply. It might not. Perhaps technological progress depends more on a stream of results from university research labs, and cannot be rushed — in which case, patience is the relevant virtue and a huge splurge on new technologies would be a waste of money. </p>



<p>So — Moore’s Law, or Wright’s Law? Farmer and his colleagues Diana Greenwald and François Lafond turned to the second world war for data. After 1939, the US vastly expanded production of military hardware, from radar to blankets. We can be confident that this was because of the wartime needs of the US and its allies, not because President Roosevelt noticed that tank manufacturers were offering some great discounts. Across a large range of products, Farmer, Greenwald and Lafond found that Wright’s Law explained about half of the fall in production costs during the war. </p>



<p>As Farmer writes, “we can say with some confidence that increasing cumulative production can drive prices down, even if this is not the full story”. Buy more, and they get cheaper. </p>



<p>Wright’s Law isn’t magic, and although it seems to apply to many products, it is rare for the price declines on offer to be as spectacular as those for aeroplanes, solar PV and computer chips. Still, where the data suggest that Wright’s Law holds strongly, governments can drive down prices by subsidising production or demand, one way or another. The individual incentive, after all, is to be a late adopter. </p>



<p>Moore himself saw his own prediction as a challenge, and co-founded the chip manufacturer Intel. Ironically, Moore seems to have been more of a follower of Wright’s Law. Moore’s Law suggests that good things come to those who wait. Wright’s Law says that good things come to those who act.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Spotify’s brief attempt at being a hardware company wasn’t all that successful: the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/27/23280357/spotify-stops-manufacturing-car-thing-q2-2022-earnings">stopped producing its Car Thing</a> dashboard accessory less than a year after it went on sale to the public. And now, two years later, the device is about to be rendered completely inoperable. Customers who bought the Car Thing are receiving emails warning that it will stop working altogether as of December 9th.</p><p>Unfortunately for those owners, Spotify isn’t offering any kind of subscription credit or automatic refund for the device — nor is the company open-sourcing it. Rather, it’s just canning the project and telling people to (responsibly) dispose of Car Thing.</p><p>“We’re discontinuing Car Thing as part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our product offerings,” Spotify wrote in <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/car-thing-discontinued/">an FAQ on its website</a>. “We understand it may be disappointing, but this decision allows us to focus on developing new features and enhancements that will ultimately provide a better experience to all Spotify users.”</p><p>The company is recommending that customers do a factory reset on the product and find some way of responsibly recycling the hardware.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>“We held a series of workshops with members of the construction industry on how we could reduce emissions from the sector,” said <a href="https://www.uselessgroup.org/">Professor Julian Allwood</a> from Cambridge’s Department of Engineering, who led the research. “Lots of great ideas came out of those discussions, but one thing they couldn’t or wouldn’t consider was a world without cement.”</p>
                <p>Concrete is made from sand, gravel, water, and cement, which serves as a binder. Although it’s a small proportion of concrete, cement is responsible for almost 90% of concrete emissions. Cement is made through a process called clinkering, where limestone and other raw materials are crushed and heated to about 1,450°C in large kilns. This process converts the materials into cement, but releases large amounts of CO₂ as limestone decarbonates into lime.</p>
                <p>Over the past decade, scientists have been investigating substitutes for cement, and have found that roughly half of the cement in concrete can be replaced with alternative materials, such as fly ash, but these alternatives need to be chemically activated by the remaining cement in order to harden.</p>
                <p>“It’s also a question of volume – we don’t physically have enough of these alternatives to keep up with global cement demand, which is roughly four billion tonnes per year,” said Allwood. “We’ve already identified the low hanging fruit that helps us use less cement by careful mixing and blending, but to get all the way to zero emissions, we need to start thinking outside the box.”</p>
                <p>“I had a vague idea from previous work that if it were possible to crush old concrete, taking out the sand and stones, heating the cement would remove the water, and then it would form clinker again,” said first author Dr Cyrille Dunant, also from the Department of Engineering. “A bath of liquid metal would help this chemical reaction along, and an electric arc furnace, used to recycle steel, felt like a strong possibility. We had to try.”</p>
                <p>The clinkering process requires heat and the right combination of oxides, all of which are in used cement, but need to be reactivated. The researchers tested a range of slags, made from demolition waste and added lime, alumina and silica. The slags were processed in the Materials Processing Institute’s EAF with molten steel and rapidly cooled.</p>
                <p>“We found the combination of cement clinker and iron oxide is an excellent steelmaking slag because it foams and it flows well,” said Dunant. “And if you get the balance right and cool the slag quickly enough, you end up with reactivated cement, without adding any cost to the steelmaking process.”</p>
                <p>The cement made through this recycling process contains higher levels of iron oxide than conventional cement, but the researchers say this has little effect on performance.</p>
                <p>The<a href="https://cambridgeelectriccement.com/"> Cambridge Electric Cement</a> process has been scaling rapidly, and the researchers say they could be producing one billion tonnes per year by 2050, which represents roughly a quarter of current annual cement production.</p>
                <p>“Producing zero emissions cement is an absolute miracle, but we’ve also got to reduce the amount of cement and concrete we use,” said Allwood. “Concrete is cheap, strong and can be made almost anywhere, but we just use far too much of it. We could dramatically reduce the amount of concrete we use without any reduction in safety, but there needs to be political will to make that happen.</p>
                <p>“As well as being a breakthrough for the construction industry, we hope that Cambridge Electric Cement will also be a flag to help the government recognise that the opportunities for innovation on our journey to zero emissions extend far beyond the energy sector.”</p>
                <p>The researchers have filed a patent on the process to support its commercialisation. The research was supported in part by Innovate UK and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Julian Allwood is a Fellow of St Catharine’s College, Cambridge.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PHP currently powers <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php">~75% of the websites</a> on the internet. It may not be the “sexy boi” of programming languages… but it has been an important actor since the internet's birth and our pulse to use it for sharing memes and cat images.
Starting today, in open beta, you’ll be able to run PHP fully in Wasmer and <a href="https://wasmer.io/products/edge">Wasmer Edge</a>.</p>
<p><em>But …why is running PHP in WebAssembly important?</em> Thanks to the properties of WebAssembly, we can safely restrict the resources that the program can access, and as such… we can run PHP safely without the overhead of OS or hardware virtualization.</p>
<p>The support for PHP in WebAssembly arrives after countless hours of work from the Wasmer team (Arshia and Amin in particular!) working to make PHP run flawlessly and as fast as possible.
<em>TL;DR: we got up to 3x faster speeds by enabling opcode caching inside WebAssembly, a feat never achieved before!</em></p>
<p>Bringing serverless-like scalability to any PHP app can unlock immense value, allowing you to run your PHP apps in the Edge and pay a fraction of the price that cloud providers charge.</p>
<p>This also means that you can run every PHP application out there with Wasmer without ever worrying that the app will break sandboxing and do harmful things they shouldn’t be able to.</p>
<p>You can now run the most popular PHP frameworks in Wasmer and Wasmer Edge:</p>

<p>All PHP templates: <a href="https://wasmer.io/templates?language=php">https://wasmer.io/templates?language=php</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Wasmer Edge support for custom filesystem volumes is on the way. The deployed apps that are using SQLite (such as Wordpress or Symfony), currently only store database changes memory, not yet permanently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To squeeze the max out of WebAssembly and PHP we have been able to enable opcode caching, allowing Wasmer to run WordPress without any modification, at 3x the speed… going from 600ms to a reasonable 200ms to render a basic blogpost page.</p>
<p><img src="https://wasmer.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.wasmer.io%2Fimages%2FScreenshot_2024-05-23_at_3.09.40_PM.original.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75" alt="WebAssembly in PHP Wasm vs Native with opcode cache enabled"></p>
<p>Do you want to try it?</p>
<p>If normally you would do:</p>
<pre><code> php -S localhost:8000 .
</code></pre>
<p>You can now simply run it fully sandboxed via Wasmer with:</p>
<pre><code>wasmer run php/php --mapdir:/app:. -- /app -S localhost:8000
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also run wordpress locally easily. Just clone the Wordpress repo: <a href="https://github.com/wasmer-examples/wordpress-wasmer-starter">https://github.com/wasmer-examples/wordpress-wasmer-starter</a> and run <code>wasmer run . --net</code> on the root! Note: you’ll need Wasmer 4.3.1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there you go… a fully functional PHP CLI running in your server, and fully sandboxed! You don’t have to worry anymore that the app will have access to your <code>/etc/passwd</code> or your precious bitcoins!</p>
<p>Welcome to the new frontier, where the software that we know and love can be compiled and run in a way that is fully sandboxed.</p>
<h2>Technical feats</h2>
<p>Getting PHP to work flawlessly in Wasm with Wasmer was not an easy feat. We solved many problems along the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>We found an obscure bug in our <code>longjmp</code>/<code>setjmp</code> implementation (required to have try/catch statements within PHP), where the stack was being overwritten and not properly restored</li>
<li>We discovered and fixed a bug slowing down outgoing HTTP calls by a 10x factor</li>
<li>We enabled PHP <code>opcache</code> by default, allowing up to 3x faster PHP times</li>
<li>Many small fixes on the filesystem virtualization layer and networking (oh, IPv6 our dear friend!)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have followed our previous blogpost on running WordPress with Wasmer, you may have realized that we have had to do countless code adaptations (a.k.a. <em>hacks</em>) in WordPress to change its behavior and not trigger a blocking edge case. Namely, these are all the <em>hacks</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We had to standardize calls to the <code>exit</code> function: <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wcgi-wordpress-demo/commit/9116a7ba25bb14cc50f1a18b81490929347c8462">https://github.com/wasmerio/wcgi-wordpress-demo/commit/9116a7ba25bb14cc50f1a18b81490929347c8462</a></li>
<li>We had to comment out any fetch calls: <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wcgi-wordpress-demo/commit/ef1550ba3cce4fb6882a738d8409aacbc09784f0">https://github.com/wasmerio/wcgi-wordpress-demo/commit/ef1550ba3cce4fb6882a738d8409aacbc09784f0</a></li>
<li>We served the static assets using the PHP interpreter (there’s code I’ve been more proud of than this one! <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wcgi-wordpress-demo/blob/main/app/hacks.php#L44-L150">https://github.com/wasmerio/wcgi-wordpress-demo/blob/main/app/hacks.php#L44-L150</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>As of today, none of those <em>hacks</em> are needed any longer.</p>
<p>The good news is that on the latest release of Wasmer, <strong>WordPress, Laravel, and Symfony run in Wasmer without any code modification</strong> whatsoever.</p>
<p>We are incredibly happy with this because running those frameworks successfully with no modifications required also means that Wasmer will likely be able to run every PHP program out there.</p>
<h2>But… how fast is it?</h2>
<p>Just running PHP at baseline speeds was not enough for our use case, we wanted to run it as fast as humanly possible in WebAssembly.</p>
<p>Thankfully for us, PHP has one module that makes its execution much faster: the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php">Zend Opcache</a>. The Opcode caching module works by optimizing and caching the bytecode that the PHP source is transformed into, thus saving time by not parsing the AST of the files that have already been processed.</p>
<p>Opcode caching can bring a 3x speed up to the number of requests an app can handle, so it seemed obvious to enable it on WebAssembly.</p>
<p>However, opcode caching (and Zend module loading) was disabled by default (as it requires <code>dlopen</code>, <code>dlsym</code>, and more support in Wasm, which is not available).</p>
<p>So we set on a unique quest: enabling opcode caching in PHP.</p>
<p>After some research, we found one novel way of doing it, and we were up for the races: we found a way to statically link it, and had to fix a bunch of things along the way… but we got it running at the end!</p>
<p>Here are the timings of WordPress without Opcache in Wasm: ~620ms</p>
<p>And the timings of WordPress with Opcache enabled in Wasm: ~205ms</p>
<p><strong>That’s a 3x speedup just by enabling Opcache!</strong></p>
<p>While doing the work, we also realized there are even further improvements that we can make to PHP to bring it close to native speeds. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Our work opens up even more avenues for projects that are currently relying on Emscripten to run PHP in the browser, such as the <a href="https://wordpress.org/playground/">WordPress playground</a>, allowing those projects to work with packages that can run both in the browser and in the Edge!</p>
<hr>
<p>But this is not all: we are working on a completely revolutionary approach to cold-starts that will supersede any other provider by a big factor (Cloudflare &amp; Fly.io, we are looking at you!)… exciting times are coming to the Edge market.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi HN! Porter Cloud (<a href="https://porter.run/porter-cloud">https://porter.run/porter-cloud</a>) is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) like Heroku, but we make it easy for you to migrate to AWS, Azure, or GCP when you're ready.</p><p>Like Heroku, Porter takes care of a lot of generic DevOps work for you (like setting up CI/CD, containerizing your applications, autoscaling, SSL certificates, setting up a reverse proxy) and lets you deploy your apps with a few clicks — saving you a lot of time while developing. However, as you probably know, there’s a downside: platforms like this become constraining if and when your app takes off and you need to scale. The time you saved while developing can get pretty expensive once you’re paying for a lot of users — and the platforms tend to try to keep you locked in!</p><p>Our idea is to give you the best of both worlds: use Porter Cloud for as long as it saves you time and development cost, but at any time you can press the “eject button” to migrate your app to your own AWS, Azure, or GCP account as you please. We make it seamless to break out, so you’re no longer subject to the rigid constraints of a conventional PaaS. You can migrate in a few simple steps outlined here: <a href="https://docs.porter.run/other/eject">https://docs.porter.run/other/eject</a>.</p><p>A bit of background: we first launched on HN almost 3 years ago with our original product (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26993421">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26993421</a>, <a href="https://porter.run/">https://porter.run</a>), which deploys your applications to your own AWS, Azure, or GCP account with the simple experience of a PaaS.</p><p>Since then, we’ve helped countless companies migrate from a PaaS to one of the big three cloud providers. Most of them had gotten started on a PaaS in the early days to optimize for speed and ease of use, but ultimately had to go through a painful migration to AWS, Azure, or GCP as they scaled and ran into various constraints on their original PaaS.</p><p>Interestingly, we learned that many companies that start on a PaaS are fully aware that they’ll have to migrate to one of the big three public clouds [1] at some point. Yet they choose to deploy on a PaaS anyway because outgrowing a cloud platform is a “champagne problem” when you’re focused on getting something off the ground. This, however, becomes a very tangible problem when you need to migrate your entire production infrastructure while serving many users at scale. It’s a “nice problem to have”, until it isn’t.</p><p>We’ve built Porter Cloud so that the next generation of startups can get off the ground as quickly as possible, with a peace of mind that you can effortlessly move to one of the tried and true hyperscalers when you are ready to scale.</p><p>We are excited to see what people build on Porter Cloud. If you’ve ever dealt with a migration from a PaaS to one of the big three cloud providers, we’d also love to hear about your experience in the comments. Looking forward to feedback and discussion!</p><p>[1] By “big three clouds” we mean the lower-level primitives of each cloud provider. We don’t mean their higher level offerings like AWS App Runner, Google Cloud Run, or Azure App Service, since those run into the same PaaS problems described above.</p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>Two years ago we launched iFixit’s Samsung Repair Hub with the goal of building an incredible, repair-friendly ecosystem. We aimed to set the gold standard for repair documentation and empower local independent repair businesses with the tools and parts they needed to thrive, all while keeping Galaxy devices running.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite our best efforts, we have not been able to deliver on that promise.</p>



<p>As we tried to build this ecosystem we consistently faced obstacles that made us doubt Samsung’s commitment to making repair more accessible. We couldn’t get parts to local repair shops at prices and quantities that made business sense. The part prices were so costly that many consumers opted to replace their devices rather than repair them. And the design of Samsung’s Galaxy devices remained frustratingly glued together, forcing us to sell batteries and screens in pre-glued bundles that increased the cost.</p>



<p>It’s with a heavy wrench that we have decided to end our <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/62839/were-building-a-galaxy-of-repair-with-samsung">partnership with Samsung</a>. Despite a huge amount of effort, Samsung’s approach to repairability does not align with our mission. This means:</p>



<ul>
<li>Starting June 2024, iFixit will no longer be Samsung’s designated third-party parts and tools distributor.</li>



<li>Also starting next month, we will no longer have a quantity limit of seven Samsung parts per repair shop per quarter.</li>



<li>No existing information will be removed from iFixit, but we will not collaborate directly with Samsung to develop new manuals.</li>



<li>We will continue to <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/Samsung_Android_Phone">sell parts and repair fix kits</a> for Samsung devices, sourcing OEM parts when available and clearly indicating whether parts are original or aftermarket. Just like we do for <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/iPhone">Apple repair parts</a>.</li>
</ul>






<p><strong>Continuing Our Mission</strong></p>



<p>Though we are sad that Samsung isn’t coming along, we’re continuing our march into a more-repairable future. We’re shipping more parts to people all over the world, expanding awareness of third-party repair, and proving to <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/56078/ifixit-works-with-microsoft-to-manufacture-service-tools-for-repair-techs">manufacturers</a> of <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/89540/how-teenage-engineering-designed-a-barcelona-factory-to-build-its-new-k-o-ii-sampler">all</a> <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/60131/how-valve-is-changing-game-console-design">stripes</a> that <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/80311/repair-makes-cents">repair is good business</a>.</p>

<p>The tide is shifting in favor of more repairable gadgets and our other partnerships have been fruitful. We just launched repair parts with <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/kobo">e-reader manufacturer Kobo</a> and have more announcements in the works. So far this year we’ve added over 10,000 new repair parts ranging from <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/PC_Laptop/Batteries">laptop batteries</a> to <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/Refrigerator">refrigerator ice makers</a>.</p>



<p>Independent repair businesses are the lifeblood of our economy, but <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/89674/how-monopolies-make-repair-harder">monopolization</a> has driven small repair businesses out of the market. Some companies hinder repair by blocking the distribution of essential parts and tools, requiring proprietary software to complete repairs, insisting on suffocating contracts, requiring expensive certifications, and pricing out the competition. This makes repairs cost more and take longer, and we won’t abide by unfriendly repair practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve been trying to counteract this trend by working to pass <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/right-to-repair-progress">repair-friendly legislation</a> and advocating for the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/88739/tell-the-ftc-we-need-right-to-repair-rules">Federal Trade Commission</a> and the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/49993/we-told-the-copyright-office-that-repair-should-be-legal-period">Copyright Office</a> to take common sense steps to protect everyone’s Right to Repair. When manufacturers reach out to us seeking to make their products last longer we are excited to help them unlock a galaxy of repair.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Samsung Didn’t Work Out</strong></p>

We still think true upcycling of old phones is a great idea—but we don’t trust Samsung to deliver.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Despite skepticism from the repair community, we tried to work with Samsung to create repair documentation for a few initial devices. However, flashy <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-galaxy-upcycling-programrepurpose-galaxy-smartphones-smart-home-devices/">press releases</a> and <a href="https://galaxyupcycling.github.io/">ambitious initiatives</a> don’t mean much without follow-through. We’ve <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/50450/samsung-galaxy-upcycling-unlocked-smartphone-smarthome-project">been through this</a> with Samsung before with Galaxy Upcycling, the amazing device reuse idea that we helped them announce. Then they ghosted us and never released it. We clearly didn’t learn our lesson the first time, and two years ago we let them convince us they were serious about embracing repair.</p>



<p>We tried to make this work. Gosh, we tried. But with such divergent priorities, we’re no longer able to proceed. So what does that mean for our community?&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Samsung phones are popular devices, we’ve tried to cover them with our in-house repair guides. But as the devices continued to decline in repairability, it made less and less sense. Having repair guides is a crucial part of repairability, but if Samsung is just profiting from unpaid work, do they really deserve that credit? We will be turning our limited guide-making bandwidth onto more deserving tech. Teardowns will proceed as normal—if the device is noteworthy enough (no pun intended), we’ll tear it down, and we still won’t pull punches on our <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/repairability">repairability scorecard</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, Samsung phones clearly need repair. No worries on that front: we will continue selling Samsung parts just as we have since 2015, well before our partnership. Although we won’t be making in-house Galaxy guides, we invite our community to keep sharing what you know about repairing Samsung devices. Anyone can make an iFixit guide—in fact, over half of our 100,000+ guides were not written by our in-house team. And for our repair shop customers, we’re no longer beholden to the miserly quantity limits you’ve been so frustrated by.</p>



<p>We’re bummed but we won’t apologize for our initial optimism. Nor will we let one bad apple spoil the bunch; instead, we’re tossing it out before it can do so. But we also won’t stop you from a chorus of “I told you so”s—honestly that’s fair. The warning signs were there—<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/8464/batteries-explode-note7">we reported on them, after all</a>.</p>



<p>But that mix of criticism and optimism is what iFixit is here for. We’re pushing the envelope and pulling all the levers we can to make repair universal.</p>



<p><strong>What Now</strong></p>



<p>Looking ahead, we’re excited to continue our fight for a more repairable world and introduce new manufacturers and enhancements to the iFixit platform:</p>



<ul>
<li>Throughout the summer, iFixit will expand our Repair Hubs with existing partners to support more devices.&nbsp;</li>



<li>We’ll launch more parts in more countries for more devices.&nbsp;</li>



<li>We will release repairability scorecards for more device categories.</li>



<li>For repair service providers, iFixit will be partnering with third-party point-of-sale providers to make accessing repair content easier.</li>



<li>We’ve <strong>expanded our parts catalog</strong> with over 10,000 new parts to support an even broader range of devices. Our new offerings include parts for televisions, PC desktops and laptops, coffee makers, appliances, and video game consoles. This expansion is just the beginning.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Repair, not replacement should be the default. If fixing things was as easy as buying new ones, more people would do it.</p>



<p>We remain obsessively focused on creating a fantastic experience for our customers and enabling independent repair businesses to thrive. We’ll only maintain business relationships with manufacturers that share our vision. As Right to Repair laws take effect this summer, we will be helping more manufacturers roll out repair solutions for their products.</p>

  <form>
    <b>Methodology:</b>
    <ol>
      <li>Generate <em>matcha.css</em> stylesheet.</li>
      <li>
        Generate report table using <a href="https://jsr.io/@libs/bundle">jsr.io/@libs/bundle</a>, which performs the following tasks:
        <ol>
          <li>Retrieves the browsers list using <a href="https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist">browserslist.</a></li>
          <li>Parses the stylesheet using <a href="https://github.com/csstree/csstree">csstree.</a></li>
          <li>Checks the support of each CSS feature across browser versions using <a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data">MDN browser compatibility data.</a></li>
          <li>Generates a summary <code><span>&lt;<span>table</span>&gt;</span></code> for easy reference.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

    <b>Notes:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Browser list adheres to <code>defaults</code> (<code>&gt; 0.5%, last 2 versions, Firefox ESR, not dead</code>).</li>
      <li>The first row displays the overall support for each browser.</li>
      <li>Please note that the auto-generated table may contain minor inaccuracies due to the complexity of mapping CSS features against compatibility data.</li>
      <li>Thus, browsers scoring 90% and above are considered fully supported.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can toggle verbosity to display additional information, such as specific CSS features and rules reported as partially supported or unsupported.

        <h3>Tales of the last Lorekeeper</h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        The paintings that cover the walls of this tower...
        These are the history of humanity and of nature itself.
        They're the tales that have been passed down by my ancestors for thousands of years.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Thousands of years ago, in the primal age long lost, the world was overflowing with natural energy.
        People could do nothing.
        The only choice was to watch as disaster upon disaster swept over them.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was in such a time that a great many meteoroids poured from the darkness of space, from a place higher even than the heavens.

    It's advisable to utilize the <code><span>&lt;<span>label</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>input</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>label</span>&gt;</span></code> pattern so <em>matcha.css</em>
    can automatically detect whether the <code><span>&lt;<span>input</span>&gt;</span></code> is required or not (which is not possible
    when using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label#for"><code><span>&lt;<span>label</span> <span>for</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>input</span>&gt;</span></code></a> pattern instead).

          <p>
  <em>matcha.css</em> provides the option to incorporate a layout for your document.
</p>
<p>
  Utilizing a layout may necessitate a refactor of your document.
  Additionally, if you choose to discontinue using <em>matcha.css</em> in the future, you may need to refactor your document again.

  <p>
    Add <code><span>.layout-simple</span></code> to the <code><span>&lt;<span>body</span>&gt;</span></code>
    to enable this layout.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Required structure:</b><br>

  </div>
  <p>
    The <code><span>@media</span> (default)</code> will hide <code><span>aside</span><span>:nth-of-type</span>(<span>1</span>)</code> on small screens, but it can be made visible again by adding a <code>data-expand</code> attribute.
    To make it collapsible, use a <code>data-expandable</code> attribute instead.
    The latter accepts a value to customize the text (e.g. <code>☰ Menu</code>).

  <p>
    These extra styles does not actually perform syntax highlighting, it is only for styling the code editor.
    It is required to include a syntax highlighting library like <a href="https://highlightjs.org/" target="_blank">highlight.js</a>.
    See the example code above for a simple implementation.

    <p>There is nothing unusual about the outside of these disks, but there is something unique about the data that is stored on them, something that Sierra On-Line would have been totally unaware of and certainly wouldn’t have wanted them to include.</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/Space_Quest_2.0D_Disk_1_small.jpg" width="100%"></p>

<p>If you happen to have one of these 720KB floppy disks lurking somewhere in your Sierra adventure game collection, then chances are you are not alone. Versions 2.0D and 2.0F of Space Quest II were not exactly uncommon.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-directory-listing">A simple directory listing</h2>

<p>Listing the files on the disk doesn’t reveal anything unusual:</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/sq2_directory_listing.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>The listing shown is from version 2.0D. There are no mysterious additional files, in fact it looks like any other Sierra game disk. Nothing is out of place.</p>

<p>The timestamps show that the game’s main data files, i.e. PICDIR, LOGDIR, VIEWDIR, SNDDIR, VOL.0 and VOL.1, were built on the 14th March 1988. The .OVL files are dated the 15th March 1988, and the AGI interpreter code itself is dated the 18th March 1988. These file timestamps capture a week of activity during which someone in the Sierra office was focused on preparing the 2.0D version of Space Quest II.</p>

<p>One thing that is a little curious about the directory listing above is that the “free” space on the disk is greater than the used space. 302,918 bytes are used and 402,432 bytes are supposedly free.</p>

<h2 id="using-a-hex-editor">Using a hex editor</h2>

<p>To take a closer look at what is on the disk, and to peek into that supposedly unused part, we need a tool called a hex editor. Back in the 1980s, a commonly used tool for this came with Norton Utilities. These days a great modern equivalent is the excellent HxD Hex Editor written by Maël Hörz.</p>

<p>For a freshly formatted DOS floppy disk, we’d expect all of the unused sectors to be filled with the 0xF6 byte value (i.e. DOS’s default format ‘filler’ byte), which is indeed the case for Disk 2 of Space Quest II version 2.0D, as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/Fully_Formatted_Sector.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>There isn’t, however, a single unused sector on Disk 1 that is filled with the 0xF6 byte, in fact the longest string of consecutive 0xF6 bytes on Disk 1 is only two. Given that over half the disk is “free” space, then clearly the disk had not been formatted prior to being prepared as a SQ2 master disk. The following shows an example of a section of the SQ2 Disk 1 disk that is marked as unused:</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/Space_Quest_2_C_Code_Sector.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>Rather than being filled with the 0xF6 byte, it is instead filled with something that looks like C source code. This strongly suggests that the master disk was used for some other purpose prior to being the SQ2 Disk 1 master disk. The files were then deleted, but the disk was not properly formatted afterwards. Due to the way the DOS FAT file system works, deleting a file does not actually remove the data. Instead it simply marks the sectors as no longer being in use, so that in the future they could be used for a new file. If those sectors are never used again for a new file, then they will keep what they previously had stored on them, and so it was important that people fully formatted a floppy disk after storing sensitive files on them.</p>

<h2 id="agi-interpreter-source-code">AGI interpreter source code</h2>

<p>It is difficult to see exactly what the above data looks like when viewed in a hex editor, but it clearly looks like text, so let’s copy and paste the ASCII text on the right hand side into a text editor to see what we have:</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/AGI_Interpreter_Source_Code.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>As we can see, it certainly does look like C source code. There are two functions defined, one called DisplayStatusLine and another called StatusLineOn. In the case of DisplayStatusLine, it appears to be displaying a line of text that includes the current score and whether the sound is on or off. Does this look familiar? You bet it does. Take a look at the top of the Space Quest II screen shot below:</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/SQ2.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>That particular piece of C source code is responsible for displaying the white status bar at the top of the game screen, with the black text that shows the user what their current score is. This source code is a part of the AGI interpreter itself!</p>

<p>This is just one small example. Scrolling through more of the unused sectors in the hex editor reveals that there is a large amount of such source code. Not only that but the code is stored over consecutive sectors, i.e. it is not fragmented as you might expect, so it is relatively easy to extract this data from the disk and then split it up into separate C source files. The split points are easy to determine, since each file has a comment at the top saying what the name of the source file is. Splitting into the separate files gives us 93 files in total, made up of 75 C source files, 16 assembly language source files, and 2 DOS BAT files:</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/List_of_AGI_Source_Files.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>In total, there are over 15000 lines of code and most of these files are complete.</p>

<p>It turns out that this Space Quest 2 game disk contains about 70% of the source code of Sierra On-Line’s AGI interpreter, complete with comments and change history. We will look at how that 70% figure was calculated later in the article.</p>

<p>When we say “the AGI interpreter”, what we are referring to is the file named “AGI” in the directory listing that was shown earlier, along with the the .OVL files. The “AGI” file is the executable that performs the actual interpretation of the game data contained in the LOGDIR, PICDIR, VIEWDIR, SNDDIR, OBJECT, WORDS.TOK and VOL files.</p>

<h2 id="source-file-change-history">Source file change history</h2>

<p>Some of the source files contain a change history within the header comment at the top. The following is an example from the ANIMATE.C source file:</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/Source_File_Header_Comment.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>The header comment starts by stating the name of the source file. It then gives a short description of what it does, in this case to “Handle one cycle of animation in an adventure game”. Next we have a line that says “compile: MWC”. This appears to state the name of the C compiler that was used to compile the C source. MWC was a C compiler from the Mark Williams company that was very popular in those days. After that, the header has a “Change History” section and this makes for very interesting reading. It mentions the date, time, initials of the person making the change, and a description of the change.</p>

<p>The programmers have identied themselves using their initials, including their middle name initial. JAS is none other than Jeff Stephenson, the main programmer who was working on the AGI interpreter code, and DCI is Chris Iden. If you look at the game credits for the AGI games from 1985-89, you will see that Jeff and Chris were always credited with working on the game development system.</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/Space_Quest_2_Credits.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>Robert Heitman is also listed, but his focus was mainly on the graphics tools (i.e. the Picture Editor (PE) and View Editor (VE)), whereas Jeff and Chris worked primarily on the interpreter code. So it isn’t surprising to see their initials in the change history for the C source code of the AGI interpreter.</p>

<h2 id="agiexe-memory-map">AGI.EXE memory map</h2>

<p>In addition to the 93 AGI interpreter source code files, the SQ2 2.0D 720KB Disk 1 disk also contains over 2000 lines of a Memory Map of the AGI.EXE executable. For production releases of AGI games, the interpreter executable is called simply AGI, and is not directly executable, but during the development of the games, Sierra On-Line used a version of the interpreter that had the .EXE extension and could be run directly. Someone at Sierra generated a memory map of the AGI.EXE executable, i.e. the AGI interpreter, on the 7th October 1987. A small section of it is shown below:</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/AGI_Memory_Map.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>This gives a potential date to the collection of source code files. It ties in with the most recent change history comment in the code, which is from September 1987.</p>

<p>The memory map also gives us a fairly complete list of the modules and source files that make up the AGI interpreter. Each module specifies the file that it is defined in. If we count the number of distinct source files mentioned, it comes to 98. The number of those source files that are present in full on the SQ2 disk is 71. This is where we get the figure of roughly 70% for the amount of AGI interpreter source code that is on the SQ2 disk. For some of the modules, only the C header file is included, and so those modules are not included in this calculation.</p>

<h2 id="sierras-intellectual-property">Sierra’s intellectual property</h2>

<p>In 1984, Sierra On-Line was lucky to survive as a business. Some time around the release of King’s Quest, in May/June of that year, Ken Williams had to lay off around 100 of his employees, reducing the head count from approximately 130 down to about 30. Although it was a struggle, part of what turned their fortunes around was the success of the AGI adventure game system and the games that were built using it. By the end of 1984, King’s Quest had entered the top 20 on the software sales charts for computer games. It would stay there for the next half year, right up until the release of King’s Quest II, and it wasn’t long until King’s Quest II was also in the charts. This was helped a lot by the deal that Sierra made with Tandy Radio Shack to sell Tandy versions of the games in the Radio Shack stores.</p>

<p>The AGI games continued to be best sellers from 1985 to 1988. Over those years, the AGI interpreter was Sierra On-Line’s primary means of making money and therefore a core part of their intellectual property. They not only invented the 3D animated graphic adventure game genre but also had a head start on their competitors that lasted several years. It is safe to say that the source code for the AGI interpreter is something that Sierra would have preferred didn’t fall into the hands of their competitors.</p>

<p>For 70% of the source code to end up being copied en masse and sent out to tens, if not hundreds of thousands of their customers, was a big blunder.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-this-happen">How did this happen?</h2>

<p>When a new release version of a game was prepared by Sierra, it involved creating a “production copy” master disk to be used by the FormMaster disk duplication machine. This machine did not simply copy files from the the master disk to each copy but instead copied every byte of every sector of the disk, regardless of whether the sectors were currently being used or not. What this meant in the case of the version 2.0D and 2.0F SQ2 Disk 1 disks is that it also copied the supposedly unused 402,432 bytes, despite there being no reason to. This is why the preparation of a master disk involved ensuring that it started out fully formatted before the game was copied on to it, and for the most part, Sierra On-Line got this step right. Most original Sierra game disks were formatted before use. It would seem that someone forgot to do this for the Space Quest II version 2.0D Disk 1 disk, and the same disk was then also used for version 2.0F of SQ2.</p>

<p>This meant that potentially hundreds of thousands of SQ2 disks sent to customers and retail stores had a copy of 70% of the AGI interpreter source code hidden on them.</p>

<h2 id="dodged-a-bullet">Dodged a bullet</h2>

<p>It was almost certainly an unintentional mistake. Surprisingly, no one appeared to have noticed that this happened, not Sierra, not their competitors or their customers, and it was only discovered decades later, the first known discovery of it by online user NewRisingSun in October 2016.</p>

<p>It is also fortuitous that this happened at the end of the AGI era. In March 1988, Sierra had already developed their SCI adventure game system and were about to release the first game using it, which would be King’s Quest IV. So “losing” the AGI interpreter source code into the public domain, should someone have noticed it, may not have been the issue it could have been only a year or two before that.</p>

<p>It makes for an interesting digital archeaology story though, and it allows us, 36 years later, to see how our heros at Sierra On-Line wrote their AGI interpreter.</p>

		<p>Southwest Airlines famously doesn’t show up when searching online travel agency websites. Historically if you’ve wanted to buy a ticket on Southwest, you’ve had to go directly to Southwest to make the purchase.
</p><p>That saves money on distribution costs since they aren’t paying third parties<br>
But it means many consumers aren’t considering Southwest since they don’t even know about the option<br>
The Southwest Airlines website became one of the first five e-commerce sites to hit a billion dollars in revenue, nearly a quarter century ago.</p>
<p>If you go to Expedia to find out about flights, you assume you’re finding out about all of the flights on a route.  Yet Southwest even <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/southwest-airlines-wins-court-ruling-to-stop-website-from-publishing-its-schedules-and-fares/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sues websites that display its schedules and fares</a> without authorization.  </p>
<p>Now, however, <u>Southwest Airlines flights appear</u> in results at <a href="http://www.google.com/flights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Flights</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-22-112403.png"></p>	<!-- /1019006/BoardingArea_DynamicContent -->
	
	
<p>When a Chrome browser extension let you see Southwest itineraries on Google flights a year and a half ago, <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/how-to-see-southwest-airlines-flights-in-your-search-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the airline killed it</a>.</p>
<p>Two things have changed since then.</p>
<ol><li><b>Southwest is struggling.</b>  <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/big-changes-coming-to-southwest-airlines-expect-extra-legroom-seats-and-some-assigned-seating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They are working on a number of changes to their business model</a> to better meet customers where they are and deliver a product that customers are demanding.  They need revenue anywhere they can get it as their losses have been surprising.  
</li><li><b>Airfare displays will have to include some fees</b> like checked bag fees under new Department of Transportation rules.  Southwest doesn’t sell basic economy fares, and hasn’t had change fees.  Other airlines largely matched the lack of change fees on non-basic economy tickets during the pandemic.  Southwest also includes two checked bags with each ticket.  <i>Competitor fares will have to show the cost of checked bag fees</i>.  Previously, displays disadvantaged Southwest but new government rules will make them look cheaper to many customers.</li></ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/new-southwest-cabin.jpg"></p>
<p>Southwest Airlines didn’t like price comparisons with other carriers on third party websites because they were often more expensive, especially given their more bundled model – in addition to the added distribution costs selling through other systems.</p>
<p>New government rules will make those same Southwest tickets appear more competitive, and Southwest is willing to allow their fares to be displayed next to those of other airlines.  And with the airline struggling they’re willing to revisit past orthodoxies.</p>

            <guid>40455208</guid>
            <pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 14:31:36 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://depot.dev/blog/faster-ec2-boot-time">https://depot.dev/blog/faster-ec2-boot-time</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40455208">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It is possible to increase the speed at which EC2 instances boot! This can be critical for certain types of workloads, where a fresh EC2 instance is needed to process some request or task. At Depot, we accelerate builds, so the
EC2 boot time directly equals the lag time for a build to start processing.</p>
<p>It can seem like EC2's boot time is fixed, that the time taken to start an instance depends solely on Amazon. However, this turns out not to be the case, there are several ways to speed up the process, especially if you know the workload that will execute on the machine after boot, like a Docker image build or GitHub Actions runner.</p>
<p>We managed to <strong>reduce EC2 boot time from 40 seconds to 5 seconds</strong> by optimizing each step in the instance launch process.</p>
<h2 id="what-takes-so-long">What takes so long?</h2>
<p>When a new EC2 instance is requested with <code>RunInstances</code>, AWS performs several different operations to prepare and boot that instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating the root EBS volume from the chosen AMI</li>
<li>Assigning the instance a private IP address</li>
<li>Choosing a target host for the instance</li>
<li>Actually booting the machine</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the instance hardware is powered on, there's also a bootloader, kernel, and userspace processes that need to start. Each of those steps happens with each instance that you launch and before your application or service starts on it.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-the-problem">Avoiding the problem</h2>
<p>In the past, we've optimized the time to start a build by <a href="https://depot.dev/blog/infrastructure-provisioner-v3">running a pool of standby compute</a>, where incoming build requests are routed to already-running EC2 instances if available. This works well for container builds, where many incoming builds for the same project are routed to the same pool of machines.</p>
<p>While this hides the EC2 start lag from users, it's not economically viable for all workloads. For <a href="https://depot.dev/blog/depot-github-actions-runners">managed GitHub Actions runners</a>, each job in a workflow is routed to a dedicated EC2 instance. And with matrix workflows, it's possible to launch many jobs in parallel. It's not possible to keep 50 EC2 instances online just to handle one customer's incoming 50-job matrix workflow.</p>
<p>But, launching 50 concurrent EC2 instances with a 40-second boot time is also not acceptable either. So, we had to look at ways to reduce the time it takes to boot an EC2 instance.</p>
<h2 id="faster-boot-times">Faster boot times</h2>
<p>One thread became common, <strong>not doing something is always faster than doing something</strong>, if that's an option for the specific workload.</p>
<p>We used this theme by systematically optimizing each step of the EC2 instance creation, boot, and application start, to reduce the time to running application from nearly 40 seconds to 5 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> — boot the instance once, shut the instance down, then boot it again when needed.</p>
<h3 id="ebs-root-volume-streaming">EBS root volume streaming</h3>
<p>Preparing the EBS root volume for use is one of the longest and most impactful aspects of EC2 instance boot time and subsequent application performance once the instance has started. When an EBS volume is created from an AMI, the following happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>The EBS volume is created, pointing at the AMI snapshot</li>
<li>When empty blocks are accessed, they receive the full performance of the volume type</li>
<li>However when data blocks are accessed for the first time, they must be pulled from S3 and written to the volume before they are returned to the instance</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that the creating of the EBS root volume is "fast", because it does not need to actually copy the contents of the AMI into the volume. But it also means that every file operation that accesses a data block for the first time will experience a large performance reduction as that data is lazily loaded from S3 in the background.</p>
<p>This can especially affect kernel and application start time. Without optimizations, our GitHub Actions runner AMI's first boot can take 5 seconds for the kernel + 5 seconds just for systemd to <em>load unit files</em>, before any processes actually start. Then on restart, since the files are already loaded from S3, that whole process takes <em>less than 400 ms!</em></p>
<h4 id="awss-recommended-solution">AWS's recommended solution</h4>
<p>AWS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-initialize.html">documents this behavior</a> and mentions a possible solution: it's possible to preload all data blocks by forcing each of them to be read once. They recommend using <a href="https://fio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fio_doc.html"><code>fio</code></a> to access each block in parallel:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="shell" data-theme="Depot"><code data-language="shell" data-theme="Depot"><span data-line=""><span>#!/bin/bash</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>volume</span><span>=</span><span>/dev/xvdf</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>sudo</span><span> fio</span><span> --filename=</span><span>$volume</span><span> --rw=read</span><span> --bs=1M</span><span> --iodepth=32</span><span> \</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  --ioengine=libaio</span><span> --direct=1</span><span> --name=volume-initialize</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>This will cause each data block to be accessed and fully streamed from S3 onto the EBS volume. There are however two potential issues with this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It's slow to access every block - for a 100 GB gp3 volume, which has a default throughput of 125 MB/s, running the <code>fio</code> above would take <em>over 13 minutes</em>! (800 seconds)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's not possible to launch a new EC2 instance with an existing EBS volume. Instead a new EBS volume is always created with the instance is launched.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, we can combine this solution with the next approach: booting the instance once before it's actually needed.</p>
<h3 id="start-the-instance-once">Start the instance once</h3>
<p>While it's not possible to launch a new EC2 instance with an existing EBS volume, it is possible to stop an EBS-backed instance and then start it again.</p>
<p>From a billing perspective, AWS does not charge for the EC2 instance itself when stopped, as there's no physical hardware being reserved; a stopped instance is just the configuration that will be used when the instance is started next. Note that you do pay for the root EBS volume though, as it's still consuming storage.</p>
<p>Therefore, it's possible to boot an EC2 instance once, let it perform whatever initialization it needs, then stop the EC2 instance, and this creates a "warmed" EBS root volume!</p>
<p>Besides warming the EBS volume, this also caches two other steps of the boot process:</p>
<ol>
<li>The configuration for the instance (tags, launch options, user data, security groups, etc)</li>
<li>The private IP address assigned to the instance</li>
</ol>
<p>This means that when the instance is started again, not only will it start with a pre-warmed EBS root volume, but also with a pre-cached instance and network configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Booting the EC2 instance is equivalent to an optimized version of <code>fio</code> pre-warming!</strong> The first time the instance starts, it will access just the data blocks that are relevant to booting the instance. Then for the next boot, those data blocks will already be loaded on the volume!</p>
<p>This makes warming very fast, rather than spending 11 minutes to read <em>every</em> data block, it takes less than 30 seconds to perform the initial boot / warming.</p>
<h4 id="autoscaling-warm-pools">Autoscaling warm pools</h4>
<p>AWS offers something very similar to this approach called <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-warm-pools.html">warm pools for EC2 Auto Scaling</a>. This allows you to define a certain number of EC2 instances inside an autoscaling group that are booted once, perform initialization, then shut down, and the autoscaling group will pull from this pool of compute first when scaling up.</p>
<p>While this sounds like it would serve our needs, autoscaling groups are <em>very slow</em> to react to incoming requests to scale up. From experimentation, it appears that autoscaling groups may have a slow poll loop that checks if new instances are needed, so the delay between requesting a scale up and the instance starting can exceed 60 seconds. For us, this negates the benefit of the warm pool.</p>
<p>Since we need the best launch performance, we launch EC2 instances directly with the <code>LaunchInstances</code> and <code>StartInstances</code> API calls instead.</p>
<h3 id="resizing-the-instance">Resizing the instance</h3>
<p>The final boot time optimization involves changing the instance type of a warmed and stopped instance. Since a stopped EC2 instance is "just" an EBS volume + the instance configuration that will be used whenever the instance is started again, it's possible to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-resize.html">change that instance's type</a> with <code>UpdateInstance</code> before starting it again.</p>
<p>This is important for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You can use cheaper instance types to perform the warming and avoid consuming AWS capacity for the warming process - we use <code>t3.large</code> instance types when first launching the instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When AWS has capacity issues and a particular instance type is unavailable, it's possible to update the instance type to another one with availability and still use the pre-warmed EBS root volume.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's also possible to update the provisioned IOPS and throughput for certain EBS volume types, including gp3, if different performance profiles are needed during the warming or running phases.</p>
<h2 id="the-whole-flow">The whole flow</h2>
<p>For us, that means that our GitHub Actions runner instances go through the following flow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Created as a <code>t3.large</code> instance with a root EBS volume</li>
<li>Assigned a private IP address in the target VPC</li>
<li>The kernel and userspace processes start once, causing the relevant data blocks to stream from S3 onto the EBS volume</li>
<li>The instance is stopped</li>
<li>When a GitHub job request arrives, the instance type is updated to a <code>m7a</code> instance type, depending on how many CPUs were requested, and the instance is started</li>
<li>If AWS responds that there is no current capacity for <code>m7a</code> instances, the instance is updated to a backup type (like <code>m7i</code>) and started again</li>
</ol>
<p>That flow reduces the time the instance for a job <strong>from over 40 seconds to under 5 seconds!</strong></p>
<h2 id="followup-work">Followup work</h2>
<p>Besides the above, it's possible to further reduce the time from instance start to application running by optimizing what software actually needs to start — for instance, we removed cloud-init from our GitHub Actions AMI as it was unused and contributed heavily to both boot and reboot time. This depends on the specific application and workload though.</p>
<p>Probably the subject of another post, but we also need to handle specific quirks of the GitHub Actions agent API - while we can boot the Actions runner within 5 seconds of a job starting, it can take GitHub 10+ seconds to actually deliver that job to the runner. We've optimized this process already, but there may be further tricks here.</p>

                  <p>As someone who has obligations to provide for a family in the USA, I can't imagine leaving dev work without an absolute clear passion and burning drive to do something specific. Giving up a six figure income I use to feed and house my family that demands I use my brain while sitting in a comfortable indoor environment, doing nothing more physically taxing than use a keyboard? Sure, I have fantasies from time to time about doing something with more dynamism in meatspace, but let's get real: it's a fantasy. I can't imagine recommending anyone with a stable career in data work upset that apple cart unless they already have a clear aim in mind, which they think about day and night - not with the unsureness of this post.</p>

I found myself getting increasingly unfit, sad, daylight-deprived and in need of doing something - anything! - else that involved me moving my body. (Bandaids like a standing desk or regular breaks or gym work or a SAD lamp couldn't really detract from the fact I was spending 8 hours a day (the brightest daylight hours too!), in the prime of my life, cooped up at a desk. After a career in live sound, I now design and install high-end A/V hardware and I love it.</p>

When your life is unsatisfying for reasons that are your fault (or just very hard to fix) and hard to grapple with (e.g., your romantic life is awful, you hate your physical apperance, you antagonized your family, you're an addict, etc.), your working hours can feel intensely oppressive with that other stuff weighing on you and the newness of scenery and focus can appear like an attractive chance to escape.

Seller's discretionary earnings is around 220k. In hindsight, I should have done this earlier. Not having to deal with office politics, insane on-call rotations, stress. On top of that, it helped me qualify for E-2 investor visa, which is far less of a headache than OPT/H-1B. It was a major help having an experienced business broker/commercial real estate agent.</p>

Now days, that still exists, but the action is also on Discord, Instagram, and Tiktok.</p><p>Once I had a little bit of a following, Casey Reas reached out about doing a group exhibition with Feral File that he was curating.

Game development is simply too volatile and risky a career for someone with that kind of family obligation.</p><p>As for the transition, I had accidentally achieved some recognition as a researcher of land economics through various blog posts. This attracted the attention of a new friend who was inspired by my work to put a startup together, seeing real estate mass appraisal as the most important missing piece for policy reasons, but also a potentially great business idea.</p><p>Investors agreed with him and a startup was formed. This gave me an alternative to game dev when I needed it most.</p><p>As for the actual work transition, I had a lot of subject matter to learn which we facilitated by hiring experts from the field, including former IAAO researchers (that’s the relevant standards body) as well as local appraisers.</p><p>I’m still learning but a lot of my skills transferred. The biggest difference is this is typically a pretty low tech field so many essential skills are soft — all the tech in the world doesn’t matter if you can’t explain things in simple terms to a citizen.

                  <p>Look for backend style work. Your infra experience is an asset, look towards cloud infra and all the programming stuff around that. Dev work ain't no panacea, there's a lot of CRUD work, and even when you get to do cool stuff like build data warehouses it's still just fancy CRUD work.</p>

The degree itself, even from a top school, doesn't guarantee you anything. It opens a few doors in finance (Investment Banks) and consulting, but you still need to fight your way through them. Wall Street also doesn't really like career changers, so it's already an uphill battle before you even enroll.</p><p>2. Silicon Valley doesn't seem to give even a tiny shit about the degree. In fact MBAs get regularly dunked on here at HN (as if the degree itself turns a smart engineer into a drooling dumbass, but whatever). So if your plan is to get an MBA to zoom back to tech to become a Director or VP or something, your plan is flawed.</p><p>I wasn't successful at either of these paths, so I went right back to "Individual Contributor" software engineering after spending 6 months unemployed hopelessly looking for an investment banking job. So the degree ended up being a waste.</p></div></td></tr>
