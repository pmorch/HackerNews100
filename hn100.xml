<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header></header><section><article> <p>A few months back, while playing around with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>, I came across something that completely derailed my plans. Strange attractors - fancy math that creates beautiful patterns. At first I thought I'd just render one and move on, but then soon I realized that this is too much fun. When complexity emerges from three simple equations, when you see something chaotic emerge into beautiful, it's hard not to waste some time. I've spent countless hours, maybe more than I'd care to admit, watching these patterns form. I realized there's something deeply satisfying about seeing order emerge from randomness. Let me show you what kept me hooked.</p>

<h2>The Basics: Dynamical Systems and Chaos Theory</h2>
<p>Dynamical Systems are a mathematical way to understand how things <strong>change over time</strong>. Imagine you have a system, which
could be anything from the movement of planets to the growth of a population. In this system, there are rules that
determine how it evolves from one moment to the next. These rules tell you what will happen next based on what is
happening now. Some examples are, a pendulum, the weather patterns, a flock of birds, the spread of a virus in a
population (we are all too familiar with this one), and stock market.</p>
<p>There are two primary things to understand about this system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase Space</strong>: This is like a big collection of all the possible states the system can be in. Each state is like a
snapshot of the system at a specific time. This is also called the <strong>state space</strong> or the <strong>world state</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamics</strong>: These are the rules that takes one state of the system and moves it to the next state. It can be
represented as a function that transforms the system from now to later.</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, when studying population growth, a phase-space (world-state) might consist of the current population size
and the rate of growth or decline at a specific time. The dynamics would then be derived from models of population
dynamics, which, considering factors like birth rates, death rates, and carrying capacity of the environment, dictate
the changes in population size over time.</p>
<p>Another way of saying this is that the dynamical systems describe how things change over time, in a space of
possibilities, governed by a set of rules. Numerous fields such as biology, physics, economics, and applied mathematics,
study systems like these, focusing on the specific rules that dictate their evolution. These rules are grounded in
relevant theories, such as Newtonian mechanics, fluid dynamics, and mathematics of economics, among others.</p>
<h3 id="chaos-theory">Chaos Theory</h3>
<p>There are different ways of classifying dynamical systems, and one of the most interesting is the classification into
chaotic and non-chaotic systems. The change over time in non-chaotic systems is more deterministic as compared to
chaotic systems which exhibit randomness and unpredictability.</p>
<p><strong>Chaos Theory</strong> is the sub branch of dynamical systems that studies chaotic systems and challenges the traditional
deterministic views of causality. Most of the natural systems we observe are chaotic in nature, like the weather, a drop
of ink dissolving in water, social and economic behaviours etc. In contrast, systems like the movement of planets,
pendulums, and simple harmonic oscillators are extremely predictable and non-chaotic.</p>
<p>Chaos Theory deals with systems that exhibit irregular and unpredictable behavior over time, even though they follow
deterministic rules. Having a set of rules that govern the system, and yet exhibit randomness and unpredictability,
might seem a bit contradictory, but it is because the rules do not always represent the whole system. In fact, most of
the time, these rules are an approximation of the system and that is what leads to the unpredictability. In complex
systems, we do not have enough information to come up with a perfect set of rules. And by using incomplete information
to make predictions, we introduce uncertainty, which amplifies over time, leading to the chaotic behaviour.</p>

<p>Chaotic systems generally have many non-linear interacting components, which we partially understand (or can partially
observe) and which are very sensitive to small changes. A small change in the initial conditions can lead to a
completely different outcome, a phenomenon known as the <strong>butterfly effect</strong>. In this post, we will try to see the
butterfly effect in action but before that, let's talk about <strong>Strange Attractors</strong>.</p>
<h2>Strange Attractors</h2>
<p>To understand Strange Attractors, let's first understand what an attractor is. As discussed earlier, dynamical systems
are all about <strong>change over time</strong>. During this change, the system moves through different possible states (remember the
phase space jargon?). An attractor is a set of states towards which a system tends to settle over time, or you can say,
towards which it is <strong>attracted</strong>. It's like a magnet that pulls the system towards it.</p>
<p>For example, think of a pendulum. When you release it, it swings back and forth, but eventually, it comes to rest at the
bottom. The bottom is the attractor in this case. It's the state towards which the pendulum is attracted.</p>
<p>This happens due to the system's inherent dynamics, which govern how states in the phase space change. Here are some of
the reasons why different states get attracted towards attractors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>: Attractors are stable states of the system, meaning that once the system reaches them, it tends to stay
there. This stability arises from the system's dynamics, which push it towards the attractor and keep it there.</li>
<li><strong>Dissipation</strong>: Many dynamical systems have dissipative forces, which cause the system to lose energy over time. This
loss of energy leads the system to settle into a lower-energy state, which often corresponds to an attractor. This is
what happens in the case of the pendulum.</li>
<li><strong>Contraction</strong>: In some regions of the phase space, the system's dynamics cause trajectories to converge. This
contraction effect means that nearby states will tend to come closer together over time, eventually being drawn
towards the attractor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some attractors have complex governing equations that can create unpredictable trajectories or behaviours. These
nonlinear interactions can result in multiple stable states or periodic orbits, towards which the system evolves. These
complex attractors are categorised as <strong>strange attractors</strong>. They are called "strange" due to their unique
characteristics.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fractal Structure</strong>: Strange attractors often have a fractal-like structure, meaning they display intricate
patterns that repeat at different scales. This complexity sets them apart from simpler, regular attractors.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions</strong>: Systems with strange attractors are highly sensitive to their initial
conditions. Small changes in the starting point can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known
as the "butterfly effect".</li>
<li><strong>Unpredictable Trajectories</strong>: The trajectories on a strange attractor never repeat themselves, exhibiting
non-periodic motion. The system's behavior appears random and unpredictable, even though it is governed by
deterministic rules.</li>
<li><strong>Emergent Order from Chaos</strong>: Despite their chaotic nature, strange attractors exhibit a form of underlying order.
Patterns and structures emerge from the seemingly random behavior, revealing the complex dynamics at play.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can observe most of these characteristics in the visualisation. The one which is most fascinating to observe is the
butterfly effect.</p>
<h3 id="the-butterfly-effect">The Butterfly Effect</h3>
<blockquote><p>A butterfly can flutter its wings over a flower in China and cause a hurricane in the Caribbean.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the defining features of strange attractors is their sensitivity to initial conditions. This means that small
changes in the starting state of the system can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known as the
<strong>butterfly effect</strong>. In chaotic systems, tiny variations in the initial conditions can amplify over time, leading to
drastically different outcomes.</p>

<p>There is another way of observing the butterfly effect in this visualisation. Change the <code>Initial State</code> from <code>cube</code> to
<code>sphere surface</code> in the control panel and observe how the particles move differently in the two cases. The particles
eventually get attracted to the same states but have different trajectories.</p>

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
<p>This visualization required rendering a large number of particles using Three.js. To achieve this efficiently, we used a
technique called <strong>ping-pong rendering</strong> <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. This method handles iterative updates of particle systems directly on the GPU,
minimizing data transfers between the CPU and GPU. It utilizes two frame buffer objects (FBOs) that alternate roles: One
stores the current state of particles and render them on the screen, while the other calculates the next state.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-workflow">Implementation Workflow</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Setting Up Frame Buffer Objects (FBOs):</strong> We start by creating two FBOs, <code>ping</code> and <code>pong</code>, to hold the current and
next state of particles. These buffers store data such as particle positions in RGBA channels, making efficient use
of GPU resources.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shader Programs for Particle Dynamics:</strong> The shader programs execute on the GPU and apply attractor dynamics to
each particle. Following is the attractor function which update the particle positions based on the attractor equation.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rendering and Buffer Swapping:</strong> In each frame, the shader computes the new positions based on the attractor's
equations and stores them in the inactive buffer. After updating, the roles of the FBOs are swapped: The previously
inactive buffer becomes active, and vice versa.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>This combination of efficient shader calculations and the ping-pong technique allows us to render the particle system.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="centercontent">
<p itemprop="description">Last night I had a very strange experience: About two thirds of the way through reading a Web page about myself, Tim Bray, I
    succumbed to boredom and killed the tab. Thus my introduction to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grokipedia">Grokipedia</a>. Here are early impressions.</p>

<p id="p-1"><span>On Bray</span> · 
My Grokipedia entry has over seven thousand words, compared to a mere 1,300 in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Bray">my Wikipedia article</a>. It’s pretty clear how it was generated; an LLM, trained
    on who-knows-what but definitely including that Wikipedia article and this blog, was told to go nuts.</p>

<p>Speaking as a leading but highly biased expert on the subject of T. Bray, here are the key take-aways:</p>

<p id="p-2"><span>(Overly) complete</span> · 
It covers all the territory; there is no phase of my life’s activity that could possibly be encountered in combing the Web
    that is not exhaustively covered. In theory this should be good but in fact, who cares about the details of what I worked on
    at Sun Microsystems between 2004 and 2010? I suppose I should but, like I said, I couldn’t force myself to plod all the way
    through it.</p>

<p id="p-3"><span>Wrong</span> · 
Every paragraph contains significant errors. Sometimes the text is explicitly self-contradictory on the face of it,
    sometimes the mistakes are subtle enough that only I would spot them.</p>

<p id="p-4"><span>Style</span> · 
The writing has that LLM view-from-nowhere flat-affect semi-academic flavor. I don’t like it but the evidence suggests that
    some people do?</p>

<p id="p-5"><span>References</span> · 
All the references are just URLs and at least some of them entirely fail to support the text. Here’s an example. In
    discussion of my expert-witness work for the FTC in their litigation against Meta concerning its acquisitions of Instagram and
    WhatsApp, Grokipedia says:</p>

<blockquote><p>[Bray] opined that users' perceptions of response times in online services critically influence market
    dynamics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It cites
    <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/FTCReplytoMetaResponse-CounterstatementofMaterialFacts.pdf">Federal
    Trade Commission’s Reply to Meta Platforms, Inc.’s Response to Federal Trade Commission’s Counterstatement of Material
    Facts</a> (warning: 2,857-page PDF). Okay, that was one of the things I argued, but the 425 pages of court documents that I
    filed, and the references to my reporting in the monster document, make it clear that it was one tiny subset of the main
    argument.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I (so that you won’t have to) spent a solid fifteen minutes spelunking back and forth through that FTC doc, looking
    for strings like “response time” and “latency” and so on. Maybe somewhere in those pages there’s support for the claim quoted
    above, but I couldn’t find it.</p>

<p id="p-6"><span>Useful?</span> · 
Wikipedia, in my mind, has two main purposes: A quick visit to find out the basics about some city or person or plant or
    whatever, or a deep-dive to find out what we <em>really</em> know about genetic linkages to autism or Bach’s relationship with
    Frederick the Great or whatever.</p>

<p>At the moment, Grokipedia doesn’t really serve either purpose very well. But, after all, this is release 0.1, maybe we
    should give it a chance.</p>

<p>Or, maybe not.</p>

<p id="p-7"><span>Woke/Anti-Woke</span> · 
The whole point, one gathers, is to provide an antidote to Wikipedia’s alleged woke bias. So I dug into that. Let’s consider
    three examples of what I found.  First, from that same paragraph about the FTC opinion quoted above:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While Bray and aligned progressives contend that such dominance stifles innovation by enabling predatory acquisitions and
      reduced rivalry—evidenced by fewer startup exits in concentrated sectors—counterarguments highlight that Big Tech's scale has
      fueled empirical gains, with these firms investing over $240 billion in U.S. R&amp;D in 2024 (more than a quarter of national
      totals) and driving AI, cloud, and patent surges.[<a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/06/08/Anti-monopoly">128</a>]
      [<a href="https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2025/number/2/article/big-tech-and-the-us-digital-military-industrial-complex.html">131</a>] Six tech industries alone accounted for
      over one-third of 
      U.S. GDP growth from 2012–2021, comprising about 9% of the 
      economy and sustaining 9.3 million jobs amid falling consumer prices and rapid technological diffusion.
      [<a href="https://itif.org/publications/2023/05/30/six-tech-industries-accounted-for-more-than-one-third-of-gdp-growth-in-the-last-decade/">132]</a> 
      [<a href="https://jamesmadison.org/the-united-states-is-the-leader-of-the-digital-revolution-pro-tech-policies-are-key/">133</a>]
      Right-leaning economists often defend consumer welfare metrics and market self-correction, warning that forced divestitures
      risk eroding the efficiencies and investment incentives that have propelled sector productivity above 6% annual growth in key
      areas like durable manufacturing tech.
      [<a href="https://itif.org/publications/2025/09/19/five-persistent-myths-about-big-tech/">134</a>]
      [<a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/oct01/technology-and-productivity-growth?page=1&amp;perPage=50">135</a>]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I’ve linked the numbered citations to the indicated URLs. Maybe visit one or two of them and see what you think? Four are
    to articles arguing, basically, that monopolies must be OK because the companies accused of it are growing really fast and
    driving the economy. They seem mostly to be from right-wing think-tanks but I guess that’s what those think-tanks are for.  One
    of them, #131, <cite>Big Tech and the US Digital-Military-Industrial Complex</cite>, I think isn’t helpful to the argument at
    all. But still, it’s broadly doing what they advertise: Pushing back against “woke” positions, in this case the position that
    monopolization is bad.</p>

<p>I looked at a couple of other examples.  For example, this is from the header of the Greta Thunberg article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While credited with elevating youth engagement on environmental issues, Thunberg's promotion of urgent, existential climate
      threats has drawn scrutiny for diverging from nuanced empirical assessments of climate risks and adaptation capacities, as
      well as for extending her activism into broader political arenas such as anti-capitalist and geopolitical protests.[5][6]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Somehow I feel no urge to click on those citation links.</p>

<p>If Ms Thunberg is out there on the “woke” end of the spectrum, let’s flit over to the other end, namely the entry for
    J.D. Vance, on the subject of his book <cite>Hillbilly Elegy</cite>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Critics from progressive outlets, including Sarah Smarsh in her 2018 book <cite>Heartland</cite>, faulted the memoir for
      overemphasizing personal and cultural failings at the expense of structural economic policies, arguing it perpetuated
      stereotypes of rural whites as self-sabotaging.[71] These objections, often rooted in institutional analyses from academia and
      media, overlooked data on behavioral patterns like opioid dependency rates—peaking at 21.5 deaths per 100,000 in Appalachia
      around 2016—that aligned with Vance's observations of "deaths of despair" precursors.[72]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I read and enjoyed <cite>Heartland</cite> but the citation is to a <cite>New Yorker</cite> article that doesn’t mention
    Smarsh. As for the second sentence… my first reaction as I trudged through its many clauses, was “life’s too short”.
    But seriously, opioid-death statistics weaken the hypothesis about structural economic issues? Don’t get it.</p>

<p id="p-8"><span>Take-away</span> · 
Wikipedia is,
    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/06/15/Wikipedia-Pain">to quote myself</a>, the encyclopedia that “anyone who’s willing to
    provide citations can edit”.
    Grokipedia is “the encyclopedia that Elon Musk’s LLM can edit, with sketchy citations and no progressive argument left
    un-attacked.”</p>

<p>So I guess it’s Working As Intended?</p>

<p><img src="https://enaix.github.io/assets/img/android-skull.jpg" alt="android skull"></p>

<p>As you all know, Google has introduced developer verification as a way to prevent users from installing “unregistered” APKs. This measure was taken as a security feature to link every APK in existence to its developer, as in Play Store.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification">Link to the Android documentation</a>, <a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification/guides/faq">link to FAQ</a></p>

<h2 id="why-this-is-bad">Why this is bad</h2>

<p>This has already been discussed by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/google-confirms-android-dev-verification-will-have-free-and-paid-tiers-no-public-list-of-devs/">ArsTechnica</a> and on some threads (some cherry-picked ones): <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1nwddik/heres_how_androids_new_app_verification_rules/">reddit</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45017028">ycombinator</a>, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2025/08/26/google-will-require-developer-verification-even-for-sideloading/">hackaday</a>.</p>

<p>A quick recap of the main points (as of 30 Oct 2025):</p>

<ul>
  <li>The base tier costs $25, as in Play Market. Requires an ID</li>
  <li>There will be a limited “hobbyist” unpaid license. Google claims that they won’t require an ID</li>
  <li>Legal info is told to be private, unlike with Play Market</li>
  <li>The verification code is supposed to be located in Play Services, <strong>but Google hasn’t published the source code yet</strong></li>
  <li>Google assures that it would be possible to install applications locally using ADB, <strong>but there are no details on this</strong></li>
  <li>Hobbyist license restrictions are unknown</li>
</ul>

<p>A few months prior Google has decided to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-makes-android-development-private-will-continue-open-source-releases/">make Android development private</a>, which seems to be a preparation for the upcoming changes (<a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-not-killing-aosp-3566882/">another article</a>). Due to this change in AOSP release format, it is no longer possible to track what exactly Google is doing.</p>

<p>My answer to this question is that it would simply prevent small developers from distributing their apps, including myself. If we take the legal route, a hobbyist license is supposed to have some limit on the number of installs by design. If we take, say, 10K installs, this is not enough in my case. Another question is how exactly the process of verification is going to happen, what if Google adopts the same rules as in Play Store? Taking my <a href="https://github.com/enaix/Kirikiroid2-debloated">fork of the old VN engine port</a>, this apk would not pass security checks, as the old codebase relies on legacy external storage permissions, which are banned in Play Store. If we take the adb route, there are <strong>no guarantees that this method is going to work in the future in the form you expect</strong>. For instance, Google mentions that this method is meant for on-device tests during development, and nothing prevents them from reporting the install to their servers and checking if a self-signed apk has been installed on other devices. Another way to put it, this is problematic for an average Android user to perform these steps, and this is going to be the developer’s problem.</p>

<p>The situation links pretty well with Samsung <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/say-goodbye-to-your-custom-roms-as-one-ui-8-kills-bootloader-unlock/">removing bootloader unlocking with the One UI 8 update</a>. Great, duh…</p>

<h2 id="the-concept">The concept</h2>

<p><img src="https://enaix.github.io/assets/img/loader1.svg" alt="apk loader"></p>

<p>My vision of the hack is to distribute a verified loader apk, which in turn dynamically loads any apk the user wants. A user obtains the loader apk once and loads apps without installing as much as they want.</p>

<p>The Java virtual machine in Android is the ART/Dalvik runtime (I will refer to it as Dalvik, it seems that Google hates cool names). Did you know that Dalvik natively <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/dalvik/system/PathClassLoader">allows dynamic code execution using PathClassLoader</a>? So an apk may just load some zip/apk/dex code from external storage and execute it in current context. Essentially, this means that we can natively load the apk into memory and execute any code inside of the target apk, and we are not altering the original code signature of the loader.</p>

<p>In order to actually run the apk, the loader needs to properly initialize the main activity (aka the main screen, or the entrypoint) of the target apk. So, the main activity needs to be initialized and somehow placed inside of the Android’s activity cycle with the loader acting as a wrapper. Then, the loader apk should handle other aspects like local files handling and names conflict resolution. This can be achieved by patching the target apk bytecode: .odex/.dex classes may be dynamically decompiled into .smali, analyzed and compiled back into a modified apk. Furthermore, the loader would have to parse AndroidManifest options of the target (main activity location, screen options).</p>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

<p>Developing such wrapper in a straightforward way has proven to be rather difficult, as Android <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/app/Activity.java">activity management logic</a> is extremely complicated and differs from version to version. In short, it was problematic to perform the initialization process the right way. Some people suggested to avoid the initialization step completely, and use Unsafe Dalvik api to register the target’s activity as the loader apk activity stub, which is declared in the loader’s manifest without class. I couldn’t find exact methods in the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/sun/misc/Unsafe">Unsafe documentation</a>, but this actually may be a way to go.</p>

<p>Due to this particular issue I couldn’t bring the proof of concept to a working state in a reasonable time, and because of this I was considering to not publish this article at all. The purpose of this post is not to give a somewhat ready solution, but get some feedback on the concept, as I was not ready to devote lots of time on a potentially broken solution.</p>

<h2 id="the-logistics">The logistics</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Information provided in this section is for educational use only, all scenarios discussed below are hypothetical.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to install the loader apk on the device, it would require, well, some form of verification. Hobbyist license is the only choice here, as paying $25 for each attempt is not optimal. Since the hobbyist license has a limited number of installs, there should be multiple instances of the apk with separate licences. In this hypothetical scenario there may either be a pool of volunteers who sign the code, or completely random users who are willing to help. In the second case, the loader code would somehow need to be verified or scanned, since such distribution system would be vulnerable to malware.</p>

<p>The final and the most important issue in this process is the verification process itself, as the loader code may (and likely will) be flagged by Google. So, the code would require some form of obfuscation like code flow modification and implementing double functionality (for instance, registering it as a file manager). If Google decides to ban dynamic code loading altogether, the final solution would be to pack the Dalvik runtime into the loader as a native library. This of course would have extremely low performance, but it should be technically possible.</p>

<p>Overall, the hypothetical plan has lots of assumptions, with which I’m not happy with. First of all, it requires lots of manual work by the volunteers or random people, and this work also includes the apk obfuscation, which was not discussed in detail. Then, the verification process itself should be somewhat permissive to allow potentially suspicious apps (I would like to hear how does this happen with current Play Store verification).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The project described in this article by no means is a finished solution, and if you have started to think what else could work, it means that the article has reached its original goal. I believe that we would eventually come up with a proper solution in the future. Thank you for reading!</p>

<p>Most leaders reflexively think of silos as BAD and collaboration as GOOD. This manifesto defends silos and challenges the value of collaboration.</p>
<h2>Increasing collaboration can do harm</h2>
<p>In general, you should aim to maximize collaboration <em>within</em> teams, and minimize collaboration <em>between</em> teams.</p>
<h3>Why maximize collaboration within teams?</h3>
<p>A collaborative team works together on one or two goals. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>This maximizes <a href="https://www.rubick.com/communication-is-shared-state/">shared state</a> — everyone has a common understanding of goals, progress, and who is doing what.</li>
<li>This gives team members a better ability to focus and coordinate their work with each other.</li>
<li>Team members have overlapping areas of knowledge, so they can critique each other’s work and help each other grow.</li>
<li>They are more innovative, because the interplay between people as they work on the same goal helps generate more diverse thinking and improve decision-making.</li>
<li>When someone leaves the team, the fact that others have a shared understanding of the work means the team can survive and continue to work effectively.</li>
<li>People can go on vacation or leave without as much disruption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Collaborative teams feel great to be a part of — everyone shares the same victories and accomplishments together. A team that doesn’t collaborate often really isn’t a team at all.</p>
<h3>Why minimize collaboration between teams?</h3>
<p>To the maximum extent possible, teams should have what they need to succeed within the borders of their team. And where that is not true, you need some structure to ensure the team can get what it needs in a way that will scale with the organization’s growth.</p>
<p>As companies grow, communication and dependencies proliferate. Companies start out with many-to-many communication. As they grow, the communication patterns within the company must necessarily switch to being segmented and defined. Otherwise, the communication burden on teams will grow at an exponential rate, and the increasing complexity will degrade the effectiveness of the company.</p>
<p>I observed an example of this at New Relic:</p>
<ol>
<li>As the engineering organization grew, we encouraged a collaborative culture and rewarded people for collaboration between teams (it was even part of our promotion criteria — you can blame that on me!).</li>
<li>After a few years, the increasing number of teams made it more and more difficult to manage dependencies between teams, to the point that it eventually became impossible to accomplish any large project within the organization. I know, because I was one of the “best project managers”, so I got put on many of those large projects — and they were systematically impossible to execute on. We all tried heroically to make it work, but the system was rigged — there wasn’t a way to accomplish these larger projects.</li>
<li>The solution to this was to eventually define the interaction models between teams, reduce dependencies, and add some <a href="https://www.rubick.com/product-council/?utm_source=ck-silos&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=silos">structure to prioritization</a> and communication.</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking back in retrospect, it was as obvious as math what happened, but I see organizations fall into this trap over and over. We’ll talk more about how to structure these solutions in the second blog post in this series.</p>
<p>Collaboration <em>sounds</em> great, but it’s something you want to actively be combating between teams. A little collaboration is fine, but excessive collaboration between teams is a sign your organization isn’t structured well. If you ever wonder why Bezos took such a hard line on his <a href="https://chrislaing.net/blog/the-memo/#fn:1">API mandate</a> in 2002, this probably factored into it. Bezos structured Amazon so that teams were as independent as possible.</p>
<h2>What are silos?</h2>
<p>Silos are boundaries between groups of people, based on the organizational structure and teams they’re working on.</p>
<h2>Why do silos exist?</h2>
<p>Silos exist because humans have cognitive and communication limits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Humans can only handle a certain number of relationships</li>
<li>Humans have a limit to how much communication they can handle.</li>
<li>Humans are pre-wired to think in terms of teams and tribes. We work better in small groups.</li>
<li>Humans have cognitive limits on the amount they can focus on.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to recognize that these limits are real limits, and not something you can wish away. Every company in the world (above a certain size) operates in teams that specialize. We organize into teams and have org structures generally because that is what human beings need to work in larger groups.</p>
<p>There are ways to flex certain aspects of this. For example, a company that is designed to be fully asynchronous can rely on process and tooling to change some of these constraints. But even then, you’re moving the constraints around, not eliminating them completely. You need to operate in a way that recognizes these limits.</p>
<h2>Why do leaders want to break down silos?</h2>
<p>Leaders start talking about breaking down silos when they see that individual parts of the company aren’t achieving larger business outcomes and are excessively focused on their own area. Alternatively, they talk about breaking down silos when parts of the company aren’t well coordinated with each other. Generally this happens once the organization has become complex enough that the structure is getting in the way.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing is planning a major announcement of an upcoming launch, but can’t get a timing commitment from the product and engineering teams.</li>
<li>Two teams in engineering are building the same service, but in slightly different ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaders see these things, and start blathering about “breaking down silos” and “increasing collaboration”. What’s wrong with that?</p>
<h2>“Breaking down silos” represents incomplete thinking</h2>
<p><strong>“Breaking down silos” is an exhortation rather than a diagnosis or prescription of how to improve the situation</strong>. “Breaking down silos” blames individuals for not having a big enough vision and working across boundaries, instead of looking with curiosity at the system and asking <em>why</em> they are doing what they’re doing. It’s expecting people to have your level of perspective without figuring out why they don’t.</p>
<p>But the main problem is that it isn’t specific enough.</p>
<h2>Communication != Collaboration != Coordination</h2>
<p>When you hear someone say they want teams to collaborate more or break down silos, encourage them to look at the problem from three perspectives:</p>
<h3>Coordination</h3>
<p>Usually when people talk about collaboration, what they’re really looking for is better coordination.</p>
<p>Coordination is “the harmonious functioning of parts for effective results” (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coordination">Merriam-Webster</a>)</p>
<p>The US military found that the best way to coordinate groups of people quickly and effectively was to <a href="https://www.marines.mil/News/Publications/MCPEL/Electronic-Library-Display/Article/899837/mcdp-1/">centralize coordination and decentralize decision-making and execution</a>. This is still the state of the art for organizational design. You want local groups to be able to act independently and have what they need to be successful. You want centralized functions to set high level objectives and coordinate where necessary to produce the right outcomes.</p>
<p>We’ll talk in the second post in this series about a multitude of ways you can coordinate groups of people working together.</p>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>Communication is transferring information from one person or group to another.</p>
<p>When people talk about needing increased collaboration, you can often achieve this more effectively by looking at the flow of information between people, and redesigning it. Typically, you can do something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask people how they are getting information today.</li>
<li>Find out what information people actually need.</li>
<li>Design the lightest weight version of this you can imagine.</li>
<li>Try it out</li>
<li>Get feedback and act on that feedback.</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing I’ve done over and over in many startups is set up weekly communication on projects in engineering. This helps the marketing organization understand how to coordinate their work with engineering, among other benefits.</p>
<h3>Collaboration</h3>
<p>Collaboration is when people work together to produce an outcome. When teams are collaborating, it means they’re working with other teams to achieve outcomes together. That’s often a sign the team isn’t set up well. Ideally, it should have what it needs to do what it needs without dependencies on other teams.</p>
<p>A team that has to collaborate to achieve its objectives is going to be less reliably successful. In general, teams shouldn’t be collaborating with more than a couple of teams, unless they’re explicitly set up to be that way. For example, in some organizations you might set up the design team as a “service” organization which provides design for a larger organization. For teams that are set up that way, it can be fine, but it usually should be very carefully thought through. What is the interaction model for the team, and how will it deal with the inevitable fact that there will be excess demands on it? We’ll cover some of these patterns and their tradeoffs in the second post in this series.</p>
<p>Of course, the world is messy, and you shouldn’t expect a complete lack of collaboration between teams. But when you see teams collaborate, that’s something to pay attention to.</p>
<h2>Technical analogy</h2>
<p>You might think of silos as “encapsulation”. Leaders want to dig into the internals of the classes holding the logic they need. But it’s a bad solution to just bolt that on — you really need to refactor things so that they are better structured.</p>
<h2>How do you get teams to coordinate better?</h2>
<p>In the next post in this series, I share concrete <a href="https://www.rubick.com/coordination-models/">patterns that help teams and departments work across organizational boundaries</a>.</p>
<h2>What do you think?</h2>

About a fifth of Americans </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/02/americans-increasingly-see-legal-sports-betting-as-a-bad-thing-for-society-and-sports/" rel="">placed</a><span> a bet in the past year, mostly through gambling apps. Since 2018, when online sports gambling got a big boost from a key Supreme Court decision, Americans have </span><a href="https://www.legalsportsreport.com/sports-betting-states/revenue/" rel="">bet</a><span> more than half a trillion dollars on sports. </span></p><p><span>And the attempts to change our culture are extremely visible; I watched the Dolphins-Ravens game last night on Amazon Prime, and I lost count of the number of ads for DraftKings and FanDuel, with various celebrities lending their names to this cultural phenomenon. Every major sports media network, sports league, and podcast are now working with a major gambling company. At this point, gambling is intrinsic to the financing of sports; FanDuel now </span><a href="https://www.theringer.com/2025/10/24/nba/nba-gambling-scandal-chauncey-billups-terry-rozier-adam-silver" rel="">operates</a><span> “15 regional sports networks across the country previously on the brink of bankruptcy.”</span></p><p><span>The broad consequences are also extremely visible. Take athletics. Americans love sports, and that cultural centerpiece is being corrupted in an orgy of greed and speculative ferver. Last week, the government </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/nyregion/nba-sports-betting-gambling-scandal.html" rel="">charged</a><span> six people, including two NBA players, for gambling-related fraud. It’s also contributing to a courser culture, with a lot of unfair pressure on athletes. According to </span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/banking/articles/2025-sports-betting-and-debt-survey" rel="">US News</a><span>, “21% of sports bettors say they’ve verbally abused an athlete, either in person or online, after losing money on a bet.”</span></p><p><span>And that’s not even getting into the costs of fostering a nation of gamblers, lured in by an app-based model that is far more convenient and addictive than traditional in-person betting. Today, four out of five </span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/banking/articles/2025-sports-betting-and-debt-survey" rel="">betters</a><span> are using betting apps or online platforms. A quarter of bettors can’t pay a bill because of their wagers, a third have gambling debts, more than half carry credit card debts, and a quarter of them are afraid they can’t control their gambling. Economists are </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4903302" rel="">finding</a><span> a “substantial increase in average bankruptcy rates, debt sent to collections, use of debt consolidation loans, and auto loan delinquencies” for consumers in states that legalized online sports betting versus those that restrict it to in-person locations. The estimates I’m told privately by experts in the field is that in the next five years, all gambling - including lotteries, Las Vegas casinos, and online sports betting - will likely see Americans lose a trillion dollars or so. </span></p><p><span>Last year, I did an Organized Money episode with </span><a href="https://www.organizedmoney.fm/p/episode-9-vice-monopolists-fanduel" rel="">Les Bernal and Dr. Kavita Fischer</a><span> on the problem; Fischer is a psychiatrist who downloaded Draft Kings in 2022 to unwind after putting her kids to bed. She ended up losing $600,000, explaining to the Wall Street Journal </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/hospitality/gambling-addiction-sports-betting-apps-4463cde0?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqe_LgM0Z396EKHXo_vX_T0lmObkaGlhcn_70DubGAlGLAdOYy3eVA3oEIMTn54%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6903c02c&amp;gaa_sig=4Unk99tCx4UcVWnftJq8NI6YmawFu_0g7uLipAxDCJHhMqxXNTJwZpnNcAEIbnSPCv8Prh1ibH__NiNBzMETJA%3D%3D" rel="">the story</a><span> of how DraftKings used sophisticated techniques to keep her betting, even as she desperately tried to stop.

Fischer’s story is very common, and it’s occurring among middle and upper middle class people who were never exposed to other forms of gambling, like state lotteries and casinos. It’s also hitting kids, who themselves are often calling in to help lines with addiction. It’s so common that Saturday Night Live did a viral skit for a fictional company called “Rock Bottom Kings,” which allows people to take bets on their degenerate gambling addict friend’s behavior. </p><div id="youtube2-wXZNuwY_5-U" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;wXZNuwY_5-U&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wXZNuwY_5-U?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>Increasingly, people are turning against this form of betting. According to Pew,  43% of U.S. adults </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/02/americans-increasingly-see-legal-sports-betting-as-a-bad-thing-for-society-and-sports/" rel="">say</a><span> “the fact that sports betting is now legal in much of the country is a bad thing for society,” up from 34% just a few years ago. And that’s concentrated among young men, who are most exposed; “47% of men under 30 say legal sports betting is a bad thing for society, up from 22% who said this in 2022.” And opposition is increasing faster among people who bet than people who don’t. It’s not that people oppose betting with friends, what’s problematic is the ability to build a business around being the house.</span></p><p><span>In an important sense, it’s odd that we’re even dealing with pervasive corporate-run gambling. Historically, Americans understood systemic gambling, and associated similar abuses of power like usury, as a moral and social catastrophe in waiting. That has been true since the 19th century, with many states making gambling unconstitutional, through to the fixing of the 1919 World Series, but it was also true well into the 20th century, when corporate gambling was constrained to mobster-run places like Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Even into the 1960s, courts </span><a href="https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2957&amp;context=clr" rel="">prevented</a><span> the patenting of gambling machines on the grounds they conflicted with the “sound morals of society.”</span></p><p><span>And culturally, we understood it as well, with gambling represented as a sinful and harmful enterprise. Take the 1987 smash hit movie </span><em>Back to the Future II. </em><span>In it, the villain, Biff Tannen, uses a time machine to alter the past so that he becomes a wealthy and corrupt casino magnate over a dilapidated town, Hill Valley. The hero, Marty McFly, in turn, must find a way to revert Hill Valley to its previous state. </span><em>Back to the Future II</em><span> was the third highest grossing film of 1989, and I remember as a kid we all saw it, and in school all my friends wondered whether hoverboards were real. Everyone just knew that corporate-run gambling was seedy.</span></p><p><span>With a few exceptions, up until the 1960s this attitude applied to all corporate gambling, from sports betting to lotteries, which were seen as similar to the “numbers racket” of the mob. But in 1963, New Hampshire Governor John King, egged on by the conservative </span><em>Manchester Union Leader, </em><span>signed a bill to create the first state lottery, to the horror of most newspapers nationwide and the Federal government, which arrested out-of-state residents for buying tickets. </span></p><p><span>Why did New Hampshire allow its new “sweepstakes” game? Well, it was </span><a href="https://www.nhmagazine.com/how-nh-defied-the-feds-mob-and-church-to-create-the-first-state-lottery/" rel="">pitched</a><span> as part of the anti-tax revolution that would take over the nation fifteen years later. One of the key supporters was Bill Loeb, the arch-conservative publisher of the </span><em>Manchester Union Leader, </em><span>who “favored the Sweepstakes because he feared without it the Legislature would pass a sales tax — something he abhorred over all else.” </span></p><blockquote><p>Pointing to the state’s reliance on so-called “sin taxes,” Loeb penned the strongest defense of the lottery yet. “No one has to go to the track and bet. No one has to smoke tobacco. No one has to drink. But how do those who oppose the Sweepstakes propose to raise the money? Either a sales tax or a property tax or some other kind of levy that people will have to pay, even though it will hurt them dreadfully to do so.”</p></blockquote><p>The New Hampshire lottery served as the “legitimization” of gambling, turning it from a seedy activity into something sanctioned by a state. And it also set in motion the same dynamic with gambling we see today, which is that residents from outside of New Hampshire would buy lottery tickets from that state, because they couldn’t get them where they live. So their state officials would wonder why they are foregoing revenue, leading to a daisy chain of legalization. Corporate gambling tended to expand in a similar pattern. After people saw that a simple state lottery could bring in more revenue, they allowed more complex gambling games, and then in-person casinos and racetracks, slot machines, and sports betting. And every time someone tried to block the expansion, the response was “well people will just do it across state lines.”</p><p>After New Hampshire, New Jersey and New York created lotteries. Then, in the 1970s, a host of progressive-leaning states across the northeast created lotteries to deal with austerity budgets, and to capture the revenue they were foregoing when their own residents went to other states to buy lottery tickets. These included Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Illinois, Ohio, Rhode Island, Vermont, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Much of the rest of the country legalized lotteries in the 1980s for similar reasons, though a few states - Utah, Alaska, and Hawaii - have not. </p><p><span>In the South, religious conservatives opposed gambling, but Reagan Republicans changed this dynamic. Moral scold Bill Bennett, who wrote “The Book of Virtues” and served as Secretary of Education and Drug Czar under Reagan, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/03/us/relentless-moral-crusader-is-relentless-gambler-too.html" rel="">exempted</a><span> gambling from his list of sins, himself carrying millions in gambling debts. A key actor was eventual RNC Chair Frank Fahrenkopf, who brought casino interests into the national Republican world, welding it together with Wall Street cash and big hotel chains by forming the American Gaming Association. </span></p><p>Corporations got into gambling in a major way. “Before 1989, you couldn’t get mainstream, Wall Street money in this industry,” said one reporter. “Now, not only can you get, they’re throwing it at you.” Fahrenkopf talked about the inflow of big corporate interests, it was now “professionals - people who have gone to business school.” These were “some of the brightest business men and women now involved in running these companies,” with the ability to “sit down with Goldman Sachs, or Bear Sterns or whoever it might be and convince them that number one, it’s a legitimate business.”</p><p><span>Martin Scorcese, in the ending of the iconic movie </span><em>Casino, </em><span>described this shift from the mob control of Vegas to Wall Street control. “Where did the money to rebuild the pyramids come from?” asked Las Vegas Sands casino leader and mobster Sam “Ace” Rothstein after he lost control of the town. “Junk Bonds.”</span></p><div id="youtube2-fBp8lLjZohg" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;fBp8lLjZohg&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;78&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fBp8lLjZohg?start=78&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>When the internet became mainstream in the 1990s, online gambling wasn’t legal, but online gambling offerings from offshore casinos became a major problem. Tennessee Senator Bill Frist, with a coalition of progressives and religious conservatives, moved a bill called the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act in 2006, which banned money transfers to offshore gaming companies. But the UIGEA had an exemption for fantasy sports, which proponents laughably called a game of skill and not chance. Over the course of the next two decades, the firms that took advantage of this law then unleashed a state-by-state lobbying campaign to legalize online sports betting.</p><p><span>The Supreme Court, in 2018, </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-476_dbfi.pdf" rel="">said</a><span> states could legalize online sports gambling, unleashing a lobbying campaign such that 39 states now allow it. Today, when you pass sports bars on Sunday’s, many of them now have special sections dedicated to gambling. On a moral and political level, many Americans came to accept corporate gambling as just another business, like usury or wild forms of financial speculation. </span></p><p>Democrats often invite gambling as a mechanism to bring in more revenue for the state. And on the right, a former casino magnate, Donald Trump, is now in the White House, and his track record running that sort of business simply didn’t enter the political debate. Trump drew immense support from the anti-gambling religious right, and progressive Democrats mocked Trump for losing money running a casino, but not for engaging in that business in the first place. </p><p>In other words, Biff Tannen’s dastardly scheme to organize a town around gambling interests would today be framed as just good economic development. </p><p>Beyond the substantive harm, there’s an ideological valence to corporate gambling. Corporate-run gambling is an unusual commercial activity, for two reasons. One is that there’s nothing produced, it’s a pure net transfer of wealth from the gambler to the casino. But the second and more important one is that it’s addictive, and thus coercive. </p><p>Gambling releases dopamine, the chemical behind pleasure and anticipation, and over time, it changes the chemistry of one’s brain to create a dependency on continuing the activity. As Fischer put it, “There was just something in my brain that made me keep going.” Thus, a company engaged in corporate gambling is seeking to take advantage of the other party’s very ability to govern their own rational faculties. </p><p>Most people think of legitimate market transactions as involving two parties coming together in a voluntary exchange based on reasonably honest information. You can go back to Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas, all the way through the populists and John Wanamaker, and find the basics of fair pricing - no coercion, no deception. But the coercion is real, and so is deception. Every online sports gambling commercial includes a help line if you have a problem, and all of the firms in the industry say they maintain ethical standards. And yet, as the Wall Street Journal story showed, their ideal customer is one who gambles excessively. </p><p><span>As legal scholar Matthew Lawrence noted, addiction is a </span><a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.emory.edu/faculty-articles/82/" rel="">fundamental threat</a><span> to liberty. Because there is an imbalance in power between the parties in the transaction, corporate gambling requires far stricter rules and regulations, or perhaps even bans, than markets for goods that are not addictive. </span></p><p>Corporate gambling also has significant broader negative consequences. Online sports betting corrupts sports and the public itself. And states often derive revenue from the practice, meaning that legislators, even if they wanted to eliminate the activity, would have to plug a fiscal hole. Like all products that foster addiction, corporate gambling creates a form of social pollution, in the form of ruined lives and public corruption. And that’s why it’s important to impose market rules that significantly limit the activity and the political power of those who profit from it.</p><p>While the religious right and Catholic institutions oppose gambling, progressives have not been particularly concerned until recently, preferring to scold around questions of race and gender than traditional fire and brimstone sins. But that is changing, as the left swings more towards concern over inequality and economics than non-commercial questions. </p><p>So what can be done?</p><p><span>Gambling is legal in other countries, for better or worse. There are a number of regulatory choices that lessen its impact. In the UK, for instance, they have what are called “</span><a href="https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-024-01150-3" rel="">stake limits</a><span>” for certain online games, meaning that gamblers have a limit on the amount they can bet in any one contest. The stake limits </span><a href="https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/28198/government-debates-gambling-reform-online-slot-stake-limits-and-statutory-levy-introduced" rel="">are lower</a><span> for certain ages. In addition, they regulate VIP programs such as the ones that entrapped Fischer, which has cut problem gambling somewhat.</span></p><p>In the U.S., we are just starting to figure out how to push back. There are possible levers around the use of data to target customers with advertisements, eliminating push notifications and VIP programs, prohibiting discrimination against “sharps,” aka people who are good at sports betting. </p><p><span>But there are significant hurdles, and not just the standard issues involved in dealing with well-capitalized corporate opponents, who engage in multiple forms of lobbying, everything from direct contacts with lawmakers to working with think tanks like </span><a href="https://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PPI-Legalized-Sports-Betting.pdf" rel="">the Progressive Policy Institute</a><span>. Unlike most other industries, corporate gambling is also a partnership with the state. To run a casino, race track, or online betting app, you need a license, and must pay the state some portion of your revenues. States themselves run lotteries. And that means gambling revenue is part of state budgets.</span></p><p><span>Take Maryland. Out of $24.86 billion of </span><a href="https://www.marylandcomptroller.gov/content/dam/mdcomp/md/reports/financial/FY2024-Closeout.pdf" rel="">state revenue</a><span> last year, $1.589 billion came from the lottery, the state’s casinos, sportsbooks and daily fantasy sports operators. Most of that was from casinos and lotteries, sports was just $89.9 million. But if you want to outlaw this harmful activity, you have to find a way to replace 6.4% of Maryland’s budget, which is slightly less than the entire amount the state brings in from corporate taxes. The fiscal gains from gambling revenues </span><a href="https://rockinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2016-04-12-Blinken_Report_Three-min.pdf" rel="">are vastly overstated</a><span>. In the short-term, it usually delivers, but quickly peters out. Indeed, Maryland Governor Wes Moore just </span><a href="https://www.legalsportsreport.com/233974/moore-signs-maryland-sports-betting-tax-hike/" rel="">increased taxes</a><span> on sports betting, as a way to plug a budget gap. And the costs are </span><a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/op-ed/op-ed-casino-revenues-are-often-short-lived-and-not-sustainable-over-long-run" rel="">likely higher</a><span> than the revenue gains. Gambling, as it turns out, is just as addictive to states as it is to gamblers, with less bang for the buck over time.</span></p><p><span>And it gets worse during economic downturns, as Pat Garofalo </span><a href="https://boondoggle.substack.com/p/the-biggest-lottery-scam-is-the-lottery" rel="">wrote</a><span> in his invaluable newsletter. </span></p><blockquote><p><span>Lottery playing increases </span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/blog/does-lottery-revenue-rise-or-fall-during-economic-hardship/#:~:text=Of%20the%2042%20states%20with,.%20%2C%20in%202001%2D2." rel="">when joblessness rises</a><span>, and more than 20 state lotteries set sales records during the Great Recession.</span></p><p><span>Because states have tied specific programs to lottery funding, they </span><em>need</em><span> that desperation, or else lottery-tied funding falls during economic downturns, when other revenues are also going south, leaving states with more holes they need to fill.</span></p><p><span>Just look at </span><a href="https://www.governing.com/finance/what-happens-to-public-budgets-when-residents-spend-less-on-the-lottery?utm_campaign=Newsletter%20-%20GOV%20-%20Future%20of%20Finance&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_7WehIfJlb1uP4po4OjBslRQp91fDfrmHzge7Rpdrq7BjHEk9kLWH_Xf9Al028bB-6WJ9cjW_aaApgTQPU7575UtilXw&amp;_hsmi=387104456&amp;utm_content=387104456&amp;utm_source=hs_email" rel="">this recent interview</a><span> with the executive director of the Virginia lottery. Though he pays a lot of lip service to ensuring that Virginians don’t become addicted to lottery games, it’s clear his overriding concern is ensuring that people keep playing even as the state’s economic outlook worsens.</span></p><p>He brings up expanding online games in order to bring in more young players, explains that “offering a mix of gaming experiences and price points helps draw in different kinds of players,” and says he wants to put lottery games into restaurants and bars — because nothing says “we’re taking gambling addiction seriously” quite like giving people easy access to gambling and alcohol together.</p></blockquote><p><span>As Garofalo noted, </span><a href="https://www.governing.com/finance/what-happens-to-public-budgets-when-residents-spend-less-on-the-lottery?utm_campaign=Newsletter%20-%20GOV%20-%20Future%20of%20Finance&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_7WehIfJlb1uP4po4OjBslRQp91fDfrmHzge7Rpdrq7BjHEk9kLWH_Xf9Al028bB-6WJ9cjW_aaApgTQPU7575UtilXw&amp;_hsmi=387104456&amp;utm_content=387104456&amp;utm_source=hs_email" rel="">10 percent</a><span> of Virginia’s public education is tied to gambling money. Even though gambling costs a state more than it brings in, cutting corporate gambling likely means it’ll be necessary to tax the wealthy.</span></p><p><span>Beyond the fiscal hurdles, there are attempts to make it impossible to even regulate gambling at a state level. Kalshi, a company that operates what it calls “prediction markets” to allow people to speculate on things like elections, is now offering sports betting. Kalshi claims that its sports betting is not gambling, but a form of useful financial market-exchange. That’s of course nonsense, but the goal is to have a Federal regulator, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, override state limits on gambling. If Kalshi wins on its legal argument, then online sports betting will be legal everywhere, without state permission.

For a long time, we have neglected the role of commerce in a moral order, choosing to ignore gambling, usury, fraud, and deceit, as well as monopolization and a whole variety of games around price. What’s happening, as we are enveloped in a world of unreality, of crypto and fraud, AI bubbles, and sports gambling, is that the corruption of our society, with the rise of scams and flattery, is becoming impossible to ignore.</p><p>Senator Benson’s bill to roll back online sports gambling in Maryland may be one of the first important moves to go on offense against corporate gambling, but it won’t be the last.</p><p><span>Thanks for reading!

<p><em>As part of our <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/our-work/public-data-project/">Public Data Project</a>, LIL recently launched <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/data-gov-archive/">Data.gov Archive Search</a>. In this post, we look under the hood and reflect on how and why we built this project the way we did.</em></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="rethinking-the-old-trade-off-cost-complexity-and-access">Rethinking the Old Trade-Off: Cost, Complexity, and Access</h2>

<p>Libraries, digital humanities projects, and cultural heritage organizations have long had to perform a balancing act when sharing their collections online, negotiating between access and affordability. Providing robust features for data discovery, such as browsing, filtering, and search, has traditionally required dedicated computing infrastructure such as servers and databases. Ongoing server hosting, regular security and software updates, and consistent operational oversight are expensive and require skilled staff. Over years or decades, budget changes and staff turnover often strand these projects in an unmaintained or nonfunctioning state.</p>

<p>The alternative, static file hosting, requires minimal maintenance and reduces expenses dramatically. For example, storing gigabytes of data on Amazon S3 may cost $1/month or less. However, static hosting often diminishes the capacity for rich data discovery. Without a dynamic computing layer between the user’s web browser and the source files, data access may be restricted to brittle pre-rendered browsing hierarchies or search functionality that is impeded by client memory limits. Under such barriers, the collection’s discoverability suffers.</p>

<p>For years, online collection discovery has been stuck between a rock and a hard place: accept the complexity and expense required for a good user experience, or opt for simplicity and leave users to contend with the blunt limitations of a static discovery layer.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="why-we-explored-a-new-approach">Why We Explored a New Approach</h2>

<p>When LIL began thinking about how to provide discovery for the <a href="https://source.coop/harvard-lil/gov-data/">Data.gov Archive</a>, we decided that building a lightweight and easily maintained access point from the beginning would be worth our team’s effort. We wanted to provide low-effort discovery with minimal impact on our resources. We also wanted to ensure that whatever path we chose would encourage, rather than impede, long-term access.</p>

<p>This approach builds on our recent experience when the Caselaw Access Project (CAP) hit <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2024/03/26/transitions-for-the-caselaw-access-project/">a transition moment</a>. At that time, we elected to switch <a href="http://case.law/">case.law</a> to a static site and to partner with others dedicated to open legal data to provide more feature-rich access.</p>

<p>CAP includes some 11 TB of data; the Data.gov Archive represents nearly 18 TB, with the catalog metadata alone accounting for about 1 GB. Manually browsing the archive data in its repository, even for a user who knows what she’s looking for, is laborious and time-consuming. Thus we faced a challenge. Could we enable dynamic, scalable discovery of the Data.gov Archive while enjoying the frugality, simplicity, and maintainability of static hosting?</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="our-experiment-rich-discovery-no-server-required">Our Experiment: Rich Discovery, No Server Required</h2>

<p>Recent advancements in client-side data analysis led us to try something new. Tools like <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/api/wasm/">DuckDB-Wasm</a>, <a href="https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2021/hosting-sqlite-databases-on-github-pages/">sql.js-httpvfs</a>, and <a href="https://protomaps.com/">Protomaps</a>, powered by standards such as WebAssembly, web workers, and HTTP range requests, allow users to efficiently query large remote datasets in the browser. Rather than downloading a 2 GB data file into memory, these tools can incrementally retrieve only the relevant parts of the file and process query results locally.</p>

<p>We developed Data.gov Archive Search on the same model. Here’s how it works:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Data storage:</strong> We store Data.gov Archive catalog metadata as sorted, compressed Parquet files on Source.coop, taking advantage of performant static file hosting.</li>
  <li><strong>In-browser query engine:</strong> Our client-side web application loads DuckDB-Wasm, a fully functional database engine running inside the user’s browser.</li>
  <li><strong>On-demand data access:</strong> When a user navigates to a resource or submits a search, our DuckDB-Wasm client executes a targeted retrieval of the data needed to fulfill the request. No dedicated server is required; queries run entirely in the browser.</li>
</ul>

<p>This experiment has not been without obstacles. Getting good performance out of this model demands careful data engineering, and the large DuckDB-Wasm binary imposes a considerable latency cost. As of this writing, we’re continuing to explore speedy alternatives like <a href="https://github.com/hyparam/hyparquet">hyparquet</a> and <a href="https://idl.uw.edu/arquero">Arquero</a> to further improve performance.</p>

<p>Still, we’re pleased with the result: an inexpensive, low-maintenance static discovery platform that allows users to browse, search, and filter Data.gov Archive records entirely in the browser.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="why-this-matters-for-libraries-digital-humanities-projects-and-beyond">Why This Matters for Libraries, Digital Humanities Projects, and Beyond</h2>

<p>This new pattern offers a compelling model for libraries, academic archives, and DH projects of all sizes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lower operating costs:</strong> By shifting from an expensive server to lower cost static storage, projects can sustainably offer their users access to data.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced technical overhead:</strong> With no dedicated backend server, security risks are reduced, no patching or upgrades are needed, and crashing servers are not a concern.</li>
  <li><strong>Sustained access:</strong> Projects can be set up with care, but without demanding constant attention. Organizations can be more confident that their archive and discovery interfaces remain usable and accessible, even as staffing or funding changes over time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing that we are not the only group interested in approaching access in this way, we’re sharing our generalized learnings. We see a few ways forward for others in the knowledge and information world:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Prototype or pilot:</strong> If your organization has large, relatively static datasets, consider experimenting with a browser-based search tool using static hosting.</li>
  <li><strong>Share and collaborate:</strong> Template applications, workflows, and lessons learned can help this new pattern gain adoption and maturity across the community.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project is still evolving, and we invite others—particularly those in libraries and digital cultural heritage—to explore these possibilities with us. We’re committed to open sharing as we refine our tools, and we welcome collaboration or feedback at <a href="mailto:lil@law.harvard.edu">lil@law.harvard.edu</a>.</p>

The Ministry achieved this status by <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/austrias-ministry-of-economy-takes-decisive-steps-toward-digital-sovereignty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">migrating 1,200 employees to a Nextcloud-based cloud and collaboration platform</a> hosted on Austrian-based infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p>This shift away from proprietary, foreign-owned cloud services, such as <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-you-can-get-microsoft-365-formerly-office-for-free-3-easy-ways/">Microsoft 365</a>, to an <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-open-source-and-how-does-it-benefit-you/">open-source</a>, European-based cloud service aligns with a growing trend among European governments and agencies. They want control over sensitive data and to declare their independence from US-based tech providers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/europes-plan-to-ditch-us-tech-giants-is-built-on-open-source-and-its-gaining-steam/">Europe's plan to ditch US tech giants is built on open source - and it's gaining steam</a></strong></p><p>European companies are encouraging this trend. Many of them have joined forces in the newly created non-profit foundation, the EuroStack Initiative. This foundation's goal is " to organize action, not just talk, around the pillars of the initiative: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/euro-stack_foundation-press-release-activity-7389635091049840641-J3gZ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAAKH4BBvA-ZwpVFbaZDTqwLgneEpGsrHQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Buy European, Sell European, Fund European</a>."&nbsp;</p><p>What's the motive behind these moves away from proprietary tech? Well, in Austria's case, Florian Zinnagl, CISO of the Ministry of Economy, Energy, and Tourism (BMWET), explained, "We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data -- from employees, companies, and citizens. As a public institution, we take this responsibility very seriously. That's why we view it critically to rely on cloud solutions from non-European corporations for processing this information."</p><p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/europes-plan-to-ditch-us-tech-giants-is-built-on-open-source-and-its-gaining-steam/">Austria's move and motivation echo similar efforts in Germany, Denmark, and other EU states and agencies</a>. The organizations include the German state of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/german-state-replaces-microsoft-exchange-and-outlook-with-open-source-email/">Schleswig-Holstein, which abandoned Exchange and Outlook for open-source programs</a>. Other agencies that have taken the same path away from Microsoft include the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-european-military-just-ditched-microsoft-for-open-source-libreoffice-heres-why/">Austrian military</a>, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-denmark-is-dumping-microsoft-office-and-windows-for-libreoffice-and-linux/">Danish government</a> organizations, and the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-city-is-dumping-microsoft-office-and-windows-for-onlyoffice-and-linux-heres-why/">French city of Lyon</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/inside-canonicals-plan-to-make-ubuntu-26-04-the-linux-desktop-that-finally-goes-mainstream/">Inside Canonical's plan to make Ubuntu 26.04 the Linux desktop that finally goes mainstream</a></strong></p><p>All of these organizations aim to keep data storage and processing within national or European borders to enhance security, comply with privacy laws such as the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/gdpr-an-executive-guide-to-what-you-need-to-know/">EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, and mitigate risks from potential commercial and foreign government surveillance.&nbsp;</p><p>Open-source software is seen as combining the virtues of faster development and better security, while providing companies and governments with more control, as general manager Thierry Carrez of the <a href="https://openinfra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">OpenInfra Foundation</a> recently suggested: "Open infrastructure allows nations and organizations to maintain control over their applications, their data, and their destiny while benefiting from global collaboration." &nbsp;</p><!----><p>The US government is worried about this trend. <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/207200" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">American diplomats have complained to French and German officials</a> ahead of November's <a href="https://dig.watch/event/summit-on-european-digital-sovereignty" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Summit on European Digital Sovereignty</a>&nbsp;about the European push for digital sovereignty. This high-level event will bring together EU institutions, member states, public and private sector leaders, and other key stakeholders to advance Europe's digital sovereignty agenda.&nbsp;</p><p>While the US may not like it, with NextCloud's help, BMWET completed its migration in just four months. Although BMWET had already begun adopting Microsoft 365 and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-copilot-is-taking-over-teams-heres-how-ai-will-shape-your-daily-workflow/">Teams</a>&nbsp;before the project's start, the shift was still considered a success. That's because instead of reversing its path, the ministry implemented a hybrid architecture: Nextcloud handles internal collaboration and secure data management, while Teams remains available for external meetings.</p><p>The project emphasized integration with existing workflows, including seamless integration with Outlook email and calendar via Sendent's Outlook app. This approach minimized disruption and ensured user acceptance. However, not all migrations progress so well.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, in Austria, the <a href="https://www.derstandard.de/story/3000000293383/prozentzeichen-statt-bundesadler-wie-die-justiz-ihre-it-umstellt" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ministry of Justice decided to replace Office with LibreOffice</a>. Yet the transition has run into trouble. It appears that the move of 20,000 desktops, which was prompted by a desire to reduce spending on Microsoft licenses, has been, as one person reported, an "unprofessional, rushed operation." Some offices are still on Office, others on LibreOffice, and they're running into incompatible document format problems and misfires in e-mail systems.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/10-open-source-windows-apps-i-cant-live-without-and-theyre-all-free/">10 open-source Windows apps I can't live without - and they're all free</a></strong></p><p>The moral of the story is that any switch from one software suite to another requires careful handling by the IT department and helpdesk staff. Otherwise, you end up with unhappy users.</p><p>That said, BMWET's bold shift to Nextcloud appears to have gone well. This initiative demonstrates that adopting sovereign cloud solutions can be practical, user-friendly, and rapid in the public sector. However, as Austria's Justice Ministry experience has shown, simply shifting to an open-source approach without careful planning can get in the way of getting work done.&nbsp;</p><div id="pinbox-575d8711-4f9c-4bea-8980-f0ae20a04381"><h4>Open Source</h4> <!---->  </div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I’ve written <em>a bit</em> about <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> and I still face moments where foundational aspects of the package system confounds and surprises me.</p>

<p>Recently I hit an issue that stumped me as it break some basic comprehension I had on how Nix works. I wanted to produce the build and runtime graph for the Ruby interpreter.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-shell <span>-p</span> ruby

<span>&gt;</span> which ruby
/nix/store/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2-ruby-3.3.9/bin/ruby

</code></pre></div>

<p>Huh. 🤔</p>

<p>I have Ruby but I don’t seem to have the derivation, <code>24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g</code>, file present on my machine.</p>

<p>No worries, I think I can <code>--realize</code> it and download it from the NixOS cache.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-store <span>--realize</span> /nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
don<span>'t know how to build these paths:
  /nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
error: cannot build missing derivation '</span>/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv<span>'
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>I guess the NixOS cache doesn’t seem to have it. 🤷</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This was actually perplexing me at this moment. In fact there are <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/how-to-get-a-missing-drv-file-for-a-derivation-from-nixpkgs/2300/1">multiple</a> <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/why-isnt-deriver-and-realize-identity-functions-see-example/47490/1">discourse</a> posts about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My mental model however of Nix though is that I must have first evaluated the derivation (drv) in order to determine the output path to even substitute. How could the NixOS cache not have it present?</p>

<p>Is this derivation wrong somehow? Nope. This is the derivation Nix believes that produced this Ruby binary from the <code>sqlite</code> database. 🤨</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> sqlite3 <span>"/nix/var/nix/db/db.sqlite"</span> 
    <span>"select deriver from ValidPaths where path = 
    '/nix/store/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2-ruby-3.3.9'"</span>
/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
</code></pre></div>

<p>What does the binary cache itself say? Even the cache itself thinks this particular derivation, <code>24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g</code>, produced this particular Ruby output.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> curl <span>-s</span> https://cache.nixos.org/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2.narinfo |<span>\</span>
  <span>grep </span>Deriver
Deriver: 24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
</code></pre></div>

<p>What if I try a different command?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix derivation show <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>)</span> | jq <span>-r</span> <span>"keys[0]"</span>
/nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv

<span>&gt;</span> <span>ls</span> /nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv
/nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv
</code></pre></div>

<p>So I seem to have a completely different derivation, <code>kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5</code>, that resulted in the same output which <em>is not</em> what the binary cache announces. WTF? 🫠</p>

<p>Thinking back to a previous post, I remember touching on <a href="https://fzakaria.com/2025/03/28/what-s-in-a-nix-store-path">modulo fixed-output derivations</a>. Is that what’s going on? Let’s investigate from first principles. 🤓</p>

<p>Let’s first create <code>fod.nix</code> which is our <em>fixed-output derivation</em>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span>
  <span>system</span> <span>=</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>currentSystem</span><span>;</span>
<span>in</span> <span>derivation</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"hello-world-fixed"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>builder</span> <span>=</span> <span>"/bin/sh"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>system</span> <span>=</span> <span>system</span><span>;</span>
  <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"-c"</span> <span>''</span><span>
</span><span>    echo -n "hello world" &gt; "$out"</span><span>
</span><span>  ''</span> <span>];</span>
  <span>outputHashMode</span> <span>=</span> <span>"flat"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>outputHashAlgo</span> <span>=</span> <span>"sha256"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>outputHash</span> <span>=</span> <span>"b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>☝️ Since this is a <em>fixed-output derivation</em> (FOD) the produced <code>/nix/store</code> path will not be affected to changes to the derivation beyond the contents of <code>$out</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate fod.nix
/nix/store/k2wjpwq43685j6vlvaarrfml4gl4196n-hello-world-fixed.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build fod.nix
/nix/store/ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1-hello-world-fixed
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now we will create a derivation that uses this FOD.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span> <span>fodDrv</span> <span>?</span> <span>import</span> <span>./fod.nix</span> <span>}:</span>

<span>let</span>
  <span>system</span> <span>=</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>currentSystem</span><span>;</span>
<span>in</span>
<span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>derivation</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"uses-fod"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>inherit</span> <span>system</span><span>;</span>
  <span>builder</span> <span>=</span> <span>"/bin/sh"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"-c"</span> <span>''</span><span>
</span><span>    echo </span><span>${</span><span>fodDrv</span><span>}</span><span> &gt; $out</span><span>
</span><span>    echo "Good bye world" &gt;&gt; $out</span><span>
</span><span>  ''</span> <span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>/nix/store</code> for the output for this derivation <em>will change</em> on changes to the derivation <strong>except</strong> if the derivation path for the FOD changes. This is in fact what makes it “modulo” the fixed-output derivations.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/85d15y7irq7x4fxv4nc7k1cw2rlfp3ag-uses-fod.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/sd12qjak7rlxhdprj10187f9an787lk3-uses-fod
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s test this all out by changing our <code>fod.nix</code> derivation.
Let’s do this by just adding some <em>garbage</em> attribute to the derivation.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@@ -4,6 +4,7 @@</span>
   name = "hello-world-fixed";
   builder = "/bin/sh";
   system = system;
<span>+  garbage = 123;
</span>   args = [ "-c" ''
     echo -n "hello world" &gt; "$out"
   '' ];
</code></pre></div>

<p>What happens now?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate fod.nix
/nix/store/yimff0d4zr4krwx6cvdiqlin0y6vkis0-hello-world-fixed.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build fod.nix
/nix/store/ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1-hello-world-fixed
</code></pre></div>

<p>The path of the derivation itself, <code>.drv</code>, has changed but the output path <code>ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1</code> remains consistent.</p>

<p>What about the derivation that leverages it?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/85wkdaaq6q08f71xn420v4irll4a8g8v-uses-fod.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/sd12qjak7rlxhdprj10187f9an787lk3-uses-fod
</code></pre></div>

<p>It also got a new derivation path but the output path remained unchanged. 😮</p>

<p>That means changes to <em>fixed-output-derivations</em> didn’t cause new outputs in either derivation <em>but</em> it did create a complete new tree of <code>.drv</code> files. 🤯</p>

<p>That means in <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs">nixpkgs</a> changes to <em>fixed-output</em> derivations can cause them to have new store paths for their <code>.drv</code> but result in dependent derivations to have the same output path. If the output path had already been stored in the NixOS cache, then we lose the link between the new <code>.drv</code> and this output path. 💥</p>

<p><img src="https://fzakaria.com/assets/images/derivation_madness.svg" alt="Derivation graphic"></p>

<p>The amount of churn that we are creating in derivations was unbeknownst to me.</p>

<p>It can get even weirder! This example came from <a href="https://github.com/ericson2314">@ericson2314</a>.</p>

<p>We will duplicate the <code>fod.nix</code> to another file <code>fod2.nix</code> whose only difference is the value of the garbage.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@</span>
   name = "hello-world-fixed";
   builder = "/bin/sh";
   system = system;

</span><span>+  garbage = 124;
</span>   args = [ "-c" ''
     echo -n "hello world" &gt; "$out"
   '' ];
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s now use both of these in our derivation.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span> <span>fodDrv</span> <span>?</span> <span>import</span> <span>./fod.nix</span><span>,</span>
  <span>fod2Drv</span> <span>?</span> <span>import</span> <span>./fod2.nix</span>

</span><span>    echo "Good bye world" &gt;&gt; $out</span><span>
</span><span>  ''</span> <span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can now instantiate and build this as normal.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/z6nr2k2hy982fiynyjkvq8dliwbxklwf-uses-fod.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/211nlyx2ga7mh5fdk76aggb04y1wsgkj-uses-fod
</code></pre></div>

<p>What is weird about that?</p>

<p>Well, let’s take the JSON representation of the derivation and remove one of the inputs.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix derivation show <span>\</span>
    /nix/store/z6nr2k2hy982fiynyjkvq8dliwbxklwf-uses-fod.drv <span>\</span>
    jq <span>'values[].inputDrvs | keys[]'</span>
<span>"/nix/store/6p93r6x0bwyd8gngf5n4r432n6l380ry-hello-world-fixed.drv"</span>
<span>"/nix/store/yimff0d4zr4krwx6cvdiqlin0y6vkis0-hello-world-fixed.drv"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can do this because although there are two input derivations, we know they both produce the same output!</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@@ -12,12 +12,6 @@</span>
       "system": "x86_64-linux"
     },
     "inputDrvs": {
<span>-      "/nix/store/6p93r6x0bwyd8gngf5n4r432n6l380ry-hello-world-fixed.drv": {
-        "dynamicOutputs": {},
-        "outputs": [
-          "out"
-        ]
-      },
</span>       "/nix/store/yimff0d4zr4krwx6cvdiqlin0y6vkis0-hello-world-fixed.drv": {
         "dynamicOutputs": {},
         "outputs": [
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s load this modified derivation back into our <code>/nix/store</code> and build it again!</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix derivation add &lt; derivation.json
/nix/store/s4qrdkq3a85gxmlpiay334vd1ndg8hm1-uses-fod.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build /nix/store/s4qrdkq3a85gxmlpiay334vd1ndg8hm1-uses-fod.drv
/nix/store/211nlyx2ga7mh5fdk76aggb04y1wsgkj-uses-fod
</code></pre></div>

<p>We got the same output <code>211nlyx2ga7mh5fdk76aggb04y1wsgkj</code>. Not only do we have a <code>1:N</code> trait for our output paths to derivations but we can also take certain derivations and completely change them by removing inputs and still get the same output! 😹</p>

<p>The road to Nix enlightenment is no joke and full of dragons.</p>

          </h3>
          <p>The Nim Team is happy to announce version 2.2.6, the third patch release for our stable release, Nim 2.2.</p>

<p>It comes six months after the 2.2.4 release and it contains <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v2.2.4...v2.2.6">141 commits</a>, bringing bugfixes and improvements.</p>

<p>If you’re still on Nim 1.6, take a look at the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/blog/2023/08/01/nim-v20-released.html">version 2.0 release article</a> to see all the features you’re missing.
If you’ve been using Nim 2.0, the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/blog/2024/10/02/nim-220-2010.html">version 2.2 release article</a> shows the improvements available in Nim 2.2.</p>

<p>The Nim 2.2.6 changelog is available <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/blob/v2.2.6/changelog.md">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>Exception handling combined with Nim’s <code>async</code> is more stable than ever before
as the underlying closure iterator transformation has been rewritten.</p>

<p>The compiler is now smart enough to produce a move operation for <code>return obj.field</code>.
Previously it performed a copy.
Expect your code to run slightly faster due to this and other minor performance improvements.</p>

<h2 id="installing-nim-226">Installing Nim 2.2.6</h2>

<p>Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.2.6 or
install it as described <a href="https://nim-lang.org/install.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you have installed a previous version of Nim using <code>choosenim</code>,
getting Nim 2.2.6 is as easy as:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>choosenim update self
<span>$ </span>choosenim update stable
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We recommend you to install and use the latest version of <code>choosenim</code>, v.0.8.16, available in <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/choosenim">our choosenim repo</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can download Nim 2.2.6 from
<a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/nightlies/releases/tag/2025-10-31-version-2-2-ab00c56904e3126ad826bb520d243513a139436a">our nightlies builds</a>.</p>

<p>GitHub releases now support immutability, adding a new layer of supply chain security. With immutable releases, assets and tags are protected from tampering after publication, so the software you publish—and your users consume—remains secure and trustworthy.</p>
<h3 id="about-immutable-releases"><a href="#about-immutable-releases">About immutable releases</a></h3>
<p>Immutable releases offer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immutable assets</strong>: Once you publish a release as immutable, its assets can’t be added, modified, or deleted. This helps protect distributed artifacts from supply chain attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Tag protection</strong>: Tags for new immutable releases are protected and can’t be deleted or moved.</li>
<li><strong>Release attestations</strong>: Immutable releases receive signed attestations so you can easily verify the authenticity and integrity of assets, both on GitHub and in external environments.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-enable-immutable-releases"><a href="#how-to-enable-immutable-releases">How to enable immutable releases</a></h3>
<p>You can enable immutable releases at the repository or organization level in your settings. Once enabled:</p>
<ul>
<li>All new releases are immutable (i.e., assets are locked and tags are protected).</li>
<li>Existing releases remain mutable unless you republish them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disabling immutability doesn’t affect releases created while it was enabled. They remain immutable.</p>
<h3 id="release-attestations-and-verification"><a href="#release-attestations-and-verification">Release attestations and verification</a></h3>
<p>Release attestations let you verify that an artifact is authentic and unchanged, even outside GitHub. Attestations use the <a href="https://docs.sigstore.dev/about/bundle/">Sigstore bundle format</a>, so you can easily verify releases and assets using the GitHub CLI or integrate with any Sigstore-compatible tooling to automate policy enforcement in your CI/CD pipelines. For instructions on how to verify the integrity of a release, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/verifying-the-integrity-of-a-release?tool=cli?utm_source=changelog-docs-immutable-releases&amp;utm_medium=changelog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25">our docs on verifying the integrity of a release</a>.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org"><h2>Abstract</h2><div><p>Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the structure of the brain, offers advantages in parallel processing, memory storage, and energy efficiency. However, current semiconductor-based neuromorphic chips require rare-earth materials and costly fabrication processes, whereas neural organoids need complex bioreactor maintenance. In this study, we explored shiitake (<em><em>Lentinula edodes</em></em>) fungi as a robust, sustainable alternative, exploiting its adaptive electrical signaling, which is akin to neuronal spiking. We demonstrate fungal computing via mycelial networks interfaced with electrodes, showing that fungal memristors can be grown, trained, and preserved through dehydration, retaining functionality at frequencies up to 5.85 kHz, with an accuracy of 90 ± 1%. Notably, shiitake has exhibited radiation resistance, suggesting its viability for aerospace applications. Our findings show that fungal computers can provide scalable, eco-friendly platforms for neuromorphic tasks, bridging bioelectronics and unconventional computing.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section1"><h2>Background</h2>
<div id="section1"><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The development of neuromorphic hardware relies on memristive devices capable of emulating synaptic behavior, with potential applications in energy-efficient computing and artificial intelligence<sup>1</sup>. Recent work has explored natural, biodegradable substrates as sustainable alternatives to conventional inorganic memristors [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref001">1</a>]. In this study, we investigated the potential of the edible fungus <em><em>Lentinula edodes</em></em> (shiitake mushroom) as a platform for memristor fabrication. By examining the electrical response of mushroom-derived materials under repeated voltage cycling, we explored stable memristive switching behavior, retention, and endurance. Shiitake-based devices not only demonstrate reproducible memory effects, but also highlight the potential for scalable, low-cost, and environmentally friendly neuromorphic components.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>Memristors</h3>
<p>Memristor devices offer substantial advantages in robotic, industrial, and transport applications due to their unique electrical properties and ability to mimic neural functions. They can enhance various control systems, facilitate efficient information processing, and ultimately improve the overall performance of autonomous systems.</p>
<p>One of the key strengths of memristors is their capacity for efficient and self-adaptive in situ learning, which is critical for applications in robotics and autonomous vehicles. In memristor-based neural networks, the devices can adjust their resistance based on previous inputs, allowing for a form of analog learning that closely resembles the synaptic behavior in biological systems [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref001">1</a>]. This capability enables robots and autonomous vehicles to learn from their environment and adapt in real time, enhancing their ability to navigate complex situations effectively. It has been found that such systems can achieve low-latency responses, which are essential for high-speed decision-making in dynamic environments [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref002">2</a>].</p>
<p>Memristors also have the advantage of integrating memory and processing capabilities into a single device, enabling a simplified architecture for autonomous control systems [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref003">3</a>]. For instance, in autonomous vehicles, trajectory-tracking and path-following tasks can be performed using memristor-based controllers that allow for rapid calculations and real-time adjustments to control variables [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref004">4</a>]. This integration, especially with parallelization, helps to address the challenges posed by separate memory and processing units, which can lead to delays and increased power consumption in traditional control systems [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref004">4</a>].</p>
<p>Additionally, the resilience of memristor devices against environmental changes, and their ability to operate under varying conditions, make them particularly suitable for autonomous applications, such as spacecraft electronics or vehicles operating in unpredictable road environments [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref004">4</a>]. This is complemented by the precision in control that memristor-based systems can offer, which is significant for maintaining stability and performance while following desired trajectories [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref005">5</a>].</p>
<p>Moreover, the low power consumption of memristors is particularly beneficial in robotics and autonomous vehicles, where energy efficiency is paramount. Hybrid analog–digital memristor systems can minimize power usage during processing without sacrificing responsiveness, which can prolong operational times by reducing the frequency at which recharging or battery replacement is required, enhancing the feasibility of deploying such systems in mobile applications [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref002">2</a>].</p>
<p>Ultimately, the potential of memristors to emulate human-like decision-making and learning processes could be exploited to endow robotic systems and autonomous vehicles with functionalities not found in conventional control systems. The ability of memristors to perform complex computations efficiently, learn adaptively, and integrate both memory and processing into a unified approach make them a cornerstone technology for the future development of intelligent autonomous systems. However, the production of memristors often requires rare-earth minerals and expensive semiconductor foundries.</p>
</div>

<div id="section3"><h3>Fungal electronics</h3>
<p>Fungi possess innate abilities to adapt to various environmental conditions and efficiently process information through their interconnected network of hyphae. These characteristics make fungi an ideal candidate for developing sustainable computing systems from. Our aim was to design and implement a novel fungal memristor-based computing architecture that could significantly reduce energy consumption and minimize electronic waste. We approached this using substantially simpler bioreactors and nutrient cultures than those required for conventional neurons and neural organoids. The unique advantages of fungal memristors stem from the biological properties of fungal materials, which distinguish them from typical inorganic or polymer alternatives [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref006">6</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref007">7</a>].</p>
<p>First, one of the main benefits of fungal memristors is their environmentally sustainable and biodegradable nature. Conventional memristors often contain transition metal oxides or silicon-based structures, the production or disposal of which can pose environmental challenges [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref006">6</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref007">7</a>]. By contrast, fungal materials are derived from organic biomass, making them both sustainable and significantly less harmful to the environment. This aligns with increasing efforts toward developing greener electronic materials, as highlighted in previous work emphasizing the importance of sustainability in technology development [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref008">8</a>].</p>
<p>Second, fungal memristors exhibit remarkable adaptability in their electrical properties. The structural composition of fungal materials often allows for a range of conductive pathways that can form dynamically under the influence of electrical stimuli, similar to the conductive filaments formed in conventional memristors [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref009">9</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref010">10</a>]. This adaptability can lead to enhanced performance in neuromorphic applications through the facilitation of variable resistance states that mimic synaptic behaviors more closely than traditional memristive materials, which often have static crystalline structures that can lead to variability problems or performance limitations at the nanoscale [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref011">11</a>].</p>
<p>Furthermore, fungal memristors may consume less power than traditional materials due to their unique electrochemical properties. It has been claimed that some organic materials, including those derived from fungi, can operate effectively at lower voltages while maintaining stable switching characteristics––a trait that is crucial for developing energy-efficient devices for portable electronics and Internet of Things applications [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref012">12</a>]. This can significantly extend battery life and reduce energy costs in processing and memory applications, which have become focal points in the research into neuromorphic systems [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref013">13</a>].</p>
<p>Finally, the natural composition and multicellularity of fungal materials can lead to more naturalistic models for neural networks. Because these materials are subject to biological processes, they may inherently incorporate characteristics that resemble biological neuronal networks, including plasticity and memory capabilities that could evolve with usage. This biological mimicry could strengthen the development of more advanced artificial neural networks, enabling applications such as adaptive learning systems and intelligent sensor networks [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref014">14</a>].</p>
</div>

<div id="section4"><h3>Fungus types</h3>
<p>The potential use of common food mushrooms, such as shiitake and button mushrooms (<em><em>Agaricus bisporus</em></em>), as organic memristors is an emerging area of research that exploits the unique properties of these fungi [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref006">6</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref007">7</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref013">13</a>]. Memristors, which are non-volatile memory devices that retain information even without power, can benefit from the porous structures and electrical properties of the organic materials derived from mushrooms.</p>
<p>Shiitake mushrooms have been shown to possess a hierarchically porous carbon structure when activated. This porous structure can enhance the electrochemical performance of devices, making them suitable candidates for use in energy storage systems, including supercapacitors and, potentially, memristors [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref015">15</a>]. Highly conductive carbon materials have been created from shiitake, suggesting that these materials could be engineered to exhibit memristive behavior [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref016">16</a>]. Shiitake-derived carbon is a sustainable alternative to traditional materials and can enhance the performance of electronic devices due to its unique structural properties.</p>
<p>Button mushrooms have also shown significant potential in this context. Research has indicated that their porosity can be exploited to create materials with large surface areas, which are essential for the development of efficient electronic components [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref017">17</a>]. The synthesis of carbon composites from button mushrooms has been explored, revealing their ability to function effectively in energy storage applications [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref017">17</a>]. Furthermore, the integration of button mushrooms into electronic systems has been investigated, demonstrating their potential as substrates for electronic devices [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref018">18</a>].</p>
<p>In addition to their structural properties, the unique biological characteristics of fungi, including their ability to interact with various chemical compounds, can be harnessed to develop novel sensing technologies. For instance, electronic noses have been developed that use mushroom extracts to detect volatile compounds. These could be adapted for use in electronic devices that require environmental-sensing capabilities [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref019">19</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref020">20</a>]. This intersection of biology and electronics opens new avenues for creating multifunctional devices that incorporate the sensory capabilities of mushrooms.</p>
</div>

<div id="section5"><h3>Radiation, resistance, and resilience</h3>
<p>The radiation resistance of shiitake mushrooms has been studied primarily in terms of their ability to withstand and possibly derive benefits from exposure to ionizing radiation. This resistance can be attributed to several biochemical and physiological attributes. A possible factor is lentinan, a polysaccharide found in the cell walls of shiitake. Lentinan provides structural integrity and exhibits immunomodulatory effects that may enhance the mushroom’s ability to respond to environmental stresses, including radiation exposure. Although some research has suggested that lentinan possesses properties that may help mitigate oxidative stress [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref021">21</a>], there have been limited studies directly linking lentinan to radiation resistance in shiitake mushrooms.</p>
<p>Shiitake mushrooms have also shown a notable ability to adapt to their environmental conditions, including variable radiation levels. Studies involving fungi in space research have indicated that certain taxa can enhance their survival through morphological changes or increased melanin production in response to radiation [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref022">22</a>]. This radiation resistance implies a suitability of fungal electronics for aerospace applications, where cosmic rays and ambient radiation can interfere with conventional electronics. Fungi’s physical flexibility and low energy requirements would also be advantageous relative to conventional solutions [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref018">18</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref019">19</a>]. These studies have not specifically addressed shiitake, but the general adaptability observed in fungi suggests that this species could respond similarly to such conditions.</p>
<p>Another example of the resilience of shiitake mushrooms is their ability to maintain their nutritional and bioactive qualities after irradiation. For example, they retain essential nutrients and bioactive compounds even after exposure to ultraviolet radiation [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref023">23</a>]. The high content of ergosterol, a precursor to vitamin D, found in shiitake mushrooms, reinforces their potential for beneficial outcomes following exposure to radiation because this compound can be converted into vitamin D<sub>2</sub> when subjected to ultraviolet light [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref024">24</a>].</p>
<p>Lastly, shiitake mushrooms could be considered in the development of dietary supplements or functional foods that could serve a broader purpose in radioprotection. Their multirole efficacy as a food source and electrical component emphasizes a sustainable approach to utilizing biological entities that can withstand environmental stresses, including radiation. This is especially relevant in aerospace and exploration contexts, where promoting health in astronauts could reduce the risks associated with their increased radiation exposure during missions [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref022">22</a>]. Also, shiitake mushrooms can withstand environmental stresses, including radiation, while remaining safe for human consumption.</p>
<p>In summary, the radiation resistance of shiitake mushrooms is linked to the presence of protective compounds, such as lentinan, and their ability to adapt morphologically. These factors have contributed to our understanding of their survival strategies and are suggestive of potential applications in areas where radiation exposure is a significant concern, such as aerospace and radiation sensing. By culturing and evaluating the memristive properties of shiitake mushrooms, we can determine their suitability for use as sustainable, low-cost bioelectronics.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section2"><h2>Methods</h2>
<div id="section1"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Testing the memristive behavior of shiitake mycelium involved several steps, the first being culturing the fungi, and then preparing the samples by drying and rehydrating them. Following this, the most successfully cultivated samples were electrically characterized using a test circuit. Additionally, a special circuit was constructed for further evaluating the feasibility of using mycelium for violate memory.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>Hyphal cultivation</h3>
<p>Due to the financial and environmental constraints of this project, all four evaluated memristors fabricated for our experiments were composed exclusively of low-cost, organic materials. Based on previous research, we identified materials such as biocompatible composites [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref025">25</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref026">26</a>] as viable candidates for device construction and programming due to their biodegradability and compatibility with fungal growth.</p>
<p>The initial phase of experimentation focused on the cultivation of fungal hyphae in the selected organic growth media. Nine samples were prepared in standard polycarbonate Petri dishes. The growth conditions were carefully maintained to promote optimal fungal development, with a controlled temperature range of 20–22°C, a relative humidity of 70%, and mixed light exposure to replicate natural terrestrial conditions. The nutrient substrate consisted of a mixture of farro seed, wheat germ, and hay, selected for their organic compositions and ability to support robust fungal growth. Each sample was inoculated with spores or mycelial plugs of shiitake.</p>
<p>The samples (e.g., see <a href="#pone-0328965-g001">Fig 1</a>) were observed and documented biweekly to track their growth consistency and morphological development. Observations including hyphal density, surface coverage, and color changes were recorded in a structured laboratory logbook. In addition to these visual inspections, a brief scratch test was performed to track the progress of the mycelium throughout the substrate. The log included timestamps and qualitative notes, enabling consistent comparison across samples and time points.</p>
</div>

<div id="section3"><h3>Drying and rehydration process</h3>
<p>Once full hyphal coverage and structural maturation were achieved (i.e., when the Petri dish was covered), the samples were transitioned to the drying phase. The Petri dishes were left in a well-ventilated area under direct sunlight at room temperature for approximately seven days to ensure uniform dehydration. The samples were rotated periodically to avoid uneven hardening. As previously reported, this process transformed the fungal matrix into a rigid, disk-like structure while retaining its overall shape and connectivity [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref026">26</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref027">27</a>].</p>
<p>Prior to testing, the samples were rehydrated using a fine mist of aerosolized deionized water. The rehydration was conducted using a standard commercial spray bottle, held within a distance of 10 cm from each sample. This brief rehydration step restored the required level of conductivity without introducing bulk moisture that could have altered their mechanical integrity.</p>
</div>

<div id="section4"><h3>Electrical characterization</h3>
<p>Electrical testing protocols were designed based on theoretical memristors [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref006">6</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref007">7</a>]. An alternating current was applied to each sample, and the corresponding current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured using a digital oscilloscope. As established in previous works, the test setup used a voltage divider to model multiple memristors in the same circuit [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref006">6</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref007">7</a>].</p>
<p>To extract accurate current values, a known shunt resistor was placed in series with each sample. As shown in <a href="#pone-0328965-g002">Fig 2</a>, voltage readings were captured across both the sample and the resistor, with Channel 1 of the oscilloscope measuring the input voltage and Channel 2 capturing the voltage drop across the shunt resistor. The current values were then calculated using Kirchhoff’s current law, allowing derivation of the I–V characteristics from the voltage differentials. All waveform data were exported in comma-separated values (CSV) format for subsequent digital analysis and visualization.</p>
<p>To thoroughly investigate the memristive behavior of the four samples using mycelium coverage density, voltage sweeps were conducted using both square and sinusoidal waveforms. The square waves were employed to detect sharp threshold-based resistance changes, whereas the sinusoidal inputs provided insights into the more subtle, continuous mem-fractive behaviors. This dual approach enabled the identification of hysteresis loops in the I–V curves––a key signature of memristor functionality.</p>
<p>A square wave was used first, with the peak-to-peak voltage starting at 200 mV<sub>pp</sub> and increasing. If a sinusoidal wave form exhibited more promising results, a broader range of frequencies was explored. The frequencies and voltages used in the initial tests for memristive properties are detailed in <a href="#pone-0328965-t001">Table 1</a>.</p>
<p>Accuracy and error were calculated based on how many reads agreed with the analog threshold, the number of malformed readings, timing jitter, recording instability, and port delays [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref028">28</a>].</p>

<p><a name="pone.0328965.e004" id="pone.0328965.e004"></a><span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965.e004" loading="lazy"><span>(3)</span></span></p></div>

<div id="section5"><h3>Volatile memory testing</h3>
<p>In the event that the fungal samples exhibited memristive behavior, a specialized electronic circuit was designed and implemented to investigate the volatile memory characteristics of two fungal samples in series. The test circuit was a voltage divider with memory. The test involved setting an arbitrary analog voltage value to represent a high value, and below that threshold was a low value. The frequency range started at 200 Hz and concluded at 5.85 kHz. Similarly to previous work, <a href="#pone-0328965-g003">Fig 3</a> shows the configuration and layout of this testing circuit [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref006">6</a>].</p>
<p>Comparably to previous work in memristive computing, the volatile memory circuit employed an Arduino UNO microcontroller development board and a voltage divider consisting of two memristive elements [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref006">6</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref007">7</a>]. Given the polarized nature of memristors, the circuit was designed to allow a voltage of opposite polarity to that used during read operations to be set. Both voltages used were approximately 5 V. The Arduino UNO cyclically applied a high signal to a relay containing a half-rectified sine wave through one of its digital output pins when reading the memristor bridge, thereby charging the divider. This process induced an asymmetry in resistance, with the memristor closest to the input experiencing a reduction in resistance, while the output-side memristor exhibited an increase. The voltage across the divider was subsequently read using an analog input pin, and another digital pin was used to run 5 V across the divider. The Arduino interpreted the stored state as “on” only when the measured voltage exceeded a predefined threshold, effectively enabling volatile memory detection based on the transient resistance states of the memristors. Ten tests were repeated on each of the four samples. The physical implementation of this circuit is shown in <a href="#pone-0328965-g004">Fig 4</a>.</p>
<p>The memristor voltage divider was tested by applying a 5 V<sub>pp</sub> sinusoidal signal to the memristors for approximately 0.01–0.1 ms. This signal was delivered via a relay triggered by digital pin 6 of the Arduino UNO. Following this brief stimulation period, the sinusoidal input was disabled, and digital pin 5 was activated to initiate the read phase. Analog voltage measurements were then acquired through the A1 analog input pin. To minimize the effects of floating voltages, a 1 MΩ pull-down resistor was connected to this pin. Voltage readings were recorded for approximately 0.1–0.10 ms before the cycle repeated, allowing for rapid and continuous testing of the memristive behavior.</p>
<p>The measurements were transmitted over a serial communication interface at a baud rate of 57,600 and were captured as raw text files for analysis. The data were post-processed and visualized using a custom Python script based on the matplotlib library, enabling clear identification of memory retention patterns and resistance state changes across successive cycles.</p>
</div>

<div id="section6"><h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<p>The general testing setup, based on that used in the literature, is able to indicate memristive behavior in fungal samples. If present, this behavior would manifest as a characteristic pinched hysteresis loop in the I–V curves, typically intersecting at or near the origin––a well-established signature of memristive systems [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref006">6</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref007">7</a>]. We hypothesized that such a response would emerge under specific combinations of voltage amplitude and input frequency. Where memristive behavior was indicated, volatile memory tests were conducted.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section3"><h2>Results</h2>
<div id="section1"><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The fungal memristors were tested across a range of voltages, waveforms, and frequencies. Below, we first detail the test inputs used to explore the memristive properties and generate I–V curves. Then we present the voltage and frequency (graphical) test results, followed by the volatile memory test results. Each figure represents the averaged, smoothed results across the samples.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>Voltage testing</h3>
<p>The first five tests were conducted to determine which voltage amplitude produced the most favorable memristive response. These initial trials revealed that a 1 V<sub>pp</sub> signal yielded the most consistent and measurable results. As outlined in the Methods section, the first four of these tests were performed using a square wave input.</p>
</div>

<div id="section3"><h3>Frequency testing</h3>
<p>After identifying 1 V<sub>pp</sub> as the optimal input voltage during the initial square wave tests (Tests 1–4), the waveform was switched to a sine wave for further analysis (Tests 5–10). The aim of this phase was to identify the frequency at which memristive behavior––specifically a pinched hysteresis loop––became apparent.</p>
<p>In Tests 1–5, the voltage amplitude was optimized using square waves. Between Tests 5 and 6, the waveform was changed from square to sine. From Tests 6–10, frequency sweeps were carried out with sine waves to identify memristive crossing. In Test 11, the voltage range was expanded at 10 Hz (5 V<sub>pp</sub>) to enhance the response. This revealed behavior close to that of an ideal memristor. Notably, Test 1 had already shown consistent linear behavior, indicating resistive characteristics. The results are shown in <a href="#pone-0328965-g005">Figs 5</a>–<a href="#pone-0328965-g013">13</a>. <a href="#pone-0328965-g014">Fig 14</a> details a sample noise profile, and <a href="#pone-0328965-g015">Fig 15</a> summarizes memristive accuracy.</p>
<p><a href="#pone-0328965-g005">Figs 5</a>–<a href="#pone-0328965-g010">10</a> show the output of Tests 2–7. The frequency was gradually reduced until a crossing near the origin was first observed, as shown in <a href="#pone-0328965-g010">Fig 10</a>. To ensure this result was not an outlier caused by overshooting the ideal frequency, the test was repeated at a slightly higher frequency (50 Hz, Test 8, shown in <a href="#pone-0328965-g011">Fig 11</a>). This confirmed that the optimal response occurred below 25 Hz.</p>
<p>As summarized in <a href="#pone-0328965-t002">Table 2</a>, the frequency was decreased to 10 Hz (Test 9, shown in <a href="#pone-0328965-g012">Fig 12</a>), which produced a clear crossing in the I–V curve near the −0.4 V region. To enhance the visibility of this behavior, the voltage was increased to 5 V<sub>pp</sub>, which resulted in a more pronounced memristive signature (Test 10). <a href="#pone-0328965-g013">Fig 13</a> illustrates this result, displaying a nearly ideal pinched hysteresis loop indicative of memristor functionality. The highest accuracy, at 95%, was at a 10 Hz sine wave at 1 V. <a href="#pone-0328965-g014">Fig 14</a> details the noise from an individual sample. <a href="#pone-0328965-g015">Fig 15</a> details the average memristive accuracy of each configuration.</p>
</div>

<div id="section4"><h3>Volatile memory experiment</h3>
<p>For the volatile memory tests 1 and 2, single read and write operations were performed across the memristor voltage divider. For volatile memory test 3, continuous read and write operations were performed across the memristor voltage divider while the frequency was gradually increased. The primary results are summarized in <a href="#pone-0328965-t003">Table 3</a>. The results are displayed in <a href="#pone-0328965-g016">Figs 16</a>–<a href="#pone-0328965-g020">20</a>. Averaged nemristive accuracy is displayed in <a href="#pone-0328965-g021">Fig 21</a>.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section4"><h2>Discussion</h2>
<div id="section1"><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Using low-cost materials, shiitake mushrooms were cultured into ideal memristors. Ideal and non-ideal memristive properties have been observed previously in fungi, but these required far more complex interfacing methods [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref026">26</a>]. Although several techniques have been proposed to preserve fungal samples, we obtained experimental validation that dehydration can preserve the observed properties in a previously “programmed” sample [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref027">27</a>]. Ideal memristor properties are observed at lower frequencies, but potential latencies can be offset through massive parallelization, as in nature [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref026">26</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref028">28</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref029">29</a>]. As known from previous works on fungal memristors, the mycelial structure contains capacitive, memfractive, and memristive proteins [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref025">25</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref026">26</a>]. In the memristive tests, accuracy decreased as the frequency increased. The observed rapid switching speed of 5,850 Hz, an accuracy of 90% (± 1%) low energy consumption relative to prior conventional systems, light weight, and radiation resistance all make fungal memristors attractive for edge computing, aerospace, and embedded firmware applications [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref025">25</a>–<a href="#pone.0328965.ref027">27</a>]. Unlike expensive conventional memristors, culturing fungal memristors does not require large facilities or rare minerals. The process can be scaled to grow large systems, which can be programmed and preserved for long-term use at low cost.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>Our study was limited by the relatively short timescale of less than two months. Other researchers have documented memristive properties in mycelial materials, but their studies also focused on short-term performance [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref026">26</a>]. Another limitation was that only single, relatively bulky samples were prepared. To truly compete with conventional devices at the microscale and below, memristors will need to be far smaller [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref007">7</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref008">8</a>,<a href="#pone.0328965.ref011">11</a>]. Even in the same growth medium, each sample produced a vastly different culture, and the outcomes have yet to be fully characterized by electrical properties. However, the development of these devices is in an early stage, and they could eventually be miniaturized, especially using improved cultivation techniques. Complications associated with the growth media were not explored, although previous research has found that fungi are quite robust to varying conditions [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref026">26</a>].</p>
</div>

<div id="section3"><h3>Future work</h3>
<p>Although fungal memristors can be produced at low cost, certain aspects of the process could be further optimized. First, consistent cultivation techniques could be improved using three-dimensional (3D)-printed templates and structures that shape the shiitake mushroom into the desired geometry. Second, programming could be facilitated by adding electrical contacts into a 3D-printed cultivation structure. Finally, long-term use would necessitate preservation, which could involve a variety of techniques, including dehydration, desiccation, freeze-drying, certain hydrogels, and special coatings [<a href="#pone.0328965.ref027">27</a>]. By testing devices produced to physical stress conditions, a combination of these techniques could enable the development of fast, radiation-resistant, and low-energy memristors grown from low-cost organic materials. The future of computing could be fungal.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section5"><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>Currently, the fabrication of semiconductor memristors requires rare-earth minerals and large facilities, and culturing delicate neural organoids requires a complex chemical environment to be maintained in a bioreactor. Fungal computing may provide a robust and accessible alternative. Fungal systems have lower power requirements, lighter weights, faster switching speeds, and lower industrial overheads than conventional devices. In this study, fungal memristors were fabricated, programmed, and tested using shiitake mushrooms and conventional electronics. Dehydration-based preservation was successfully explored, demonstrating the robustness of our devices. When used as RAM, our mushroom memristor was able to operate at up to 5,850 Hz at an accuracy of 90 ± 1%. In addition, shiitake mushrooms are biodegradable and have demonstrated radiation resistance, suggesting that the potential applications of fungal computing range from sustainable computing devices to aerospace technologies.</p>

            <p>Nearly everyone has experienced it: After a night of poor sleep, you don’t feel as alert as you should. Your brain might seem foggy, and your mind drifts off when you should be paying attention.</p><p>A new study from MIT reveals what happens inside the brain as these momentary failures of attention occur. The scientists found that during these lapses, a wave of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows out of the brain — a process that typically occurs during sleep and helps to wash away waste products that have built up during the day. This flushing is believed to be necessary for maintaining a healthy, normally functioning brain.</p><p>When a person is sleep-deprived, it appears that their body attempts to catch up on this cleansing process by initiating pulses of CSF flow. However, this comes at a cost of dramatically impaired attention.</p><p>“If you don’t sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn’t see them. However, they come with an attentional tradeoff, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow,” says Laura Lewis, the Athinoula A. Martinos Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a member of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics, and an associate member of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.</p><p>Lewis is the senior author of the study, which <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02098-8" target="_blank">appears today</a> in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>. MIT visiting graduate student Zinong Yang&nbsp;is the lead author of the paper.</p><p><strong>Flushing the brain</strong></p><p>Although sleep is a critical biological process, it’s not known exactly why it is so important. It appears to be essential for maintaining alertness, and it has been well-documented that sleep deprivation leads to impairments of attention and other cognitive functions.</p><p>During sleep, the cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the brain helps to remove waste that has built up during the day. In a 2019&nbsp;<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax5440" target="_blank">study</a>, Lewis and colleagues showed that CSF flow during sleep follows a rhythmic pattern in and out of the brain, and that these flows are linked to changes in brain waves during sleep.</p><p>That finding led Lewis to wonder what might happen to CSF flow after sleep deprivation. To explore that question, she and her colleagues recruited 26 volunteers who were tested twice — once following a night of sleep deprivation in the lab, and once when they were well-rested.</p><p>In the morning, the researchers monitored several different measures of brain and body function as the participants performed a task that is commonly used to evaluate the effects of sleep deprivation.</p><p>During the task, each participant wore an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap that could record brain waves while they were also in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. The researchers used a modified version of fMRI that allowed them to measure not only blood oxygenation in the brain, but also the flow of CSF in and out of the brain. They also measured each subject’s heart rate, breathing rate, and pupil diameter.</p><p>The participants performed two attentional tasks while in the fMRI scanner, one visual and one auditory. For the visual task, they had to look at a screen that had a fixed cross. At random intervals, the cross would turn into a square, and the participants were told to press a button whenever they saw this happen. For the auditory task, they would hear a beep instead of seeing a visual transformation.</p><p>Sleep-deprived participants performed much worse than well-rested participants on these tasks, as expected. Their response times were slower, and for some of the stimuli, the participants never registered the change at all.</p><p>During these momentary lapses of attention, the researchers identified several physiological changes that occurred at the same time. Most significantly, they found a flux of CSF out of the brain just as those lapses occurred. After each lapse, CSF flowed back into the brain.</p><p>“The results are suggesting that at the moment that attention fails, this fluid is actually being expelled outward away from the brain. And when attention recovers, it’s drawn back in,” Lewis says.</p><p>The researchers hypothesize that when the brain is sleep-deprived, it begins to compensate for the loss of the cleansing that normally occurs during sleep, even though these pulses of CSF flow&nbsp;come with the cost of attention loss.</p><p>“One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions,” Yang says. “Your brain’s fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states.”</p><p><strong>A unified circuit</strong></p><p>The researchers also found several other physiological events linked to attentional lapses, including decreases in breathing and heart rate, along with constriction of the pupils. They found that pupil constriction began about 12 seconds before CSF flowed out of the brain, and pupils dilated again after the attentional lapse.</p><p>“What’s interesting is it seems like this isn’t just a phenomenon in the brain, it’s also a body-wide event. It suggests that there’s a tight coordination of these systems, where when your attention fails, you might feel it perceptually and psychologically, but it’s also reflecting an event that’s happening throughout the brain and body,” Lewis says.</p><p>This close linkage between disparate events may indicate that there is a single circuit that controls both attention and bodily functions such as fluid flow, heart rate, and arousal, according to the researchers.</p><p>“These results suggest to us that there’s a unified circuit that’s governing both what we think of as very high-level functions of the brain — our attention, our ability to perceive and respond to the world — and then also really basic fundamental physiological processes like fluid dynamics of the brain, brain-wide blood flow, and blood vessel constriction,” Lewis says.</p><p>In this study, the researchers did not explore what circuit might be controlling this switching, but one good candidate, they say, is the noradrenergic system. Recent research has shown that this system, which regulates many cognitive and bodily functions through the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, oscillates during normal sleep.</p><p>The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship, a NAWA Fellowship, a McKnight Scholar Award, a Sloan Fellowship, a Pew Biomedical Scholar Award, a One Mind Rising Star Award, and the Simons Collaboration on Plasticity in the Aging Brain.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lalitm.com/perfetto-swiss-army-knife/">https://lalitm.com/perfetto-swiss-army-knife/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45771019">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I gave a talk at the <a href="https://tracingsummit.org/">2025 Tracing Summit</a> last month titled “<a href="https://cfp.tracingsummit.org/ts2025/talk/TKVU8W/">Perfetto: The Swiss Army Knife of Linux Client/Embedded Tracing</a>”. My goal in this talk was to show how Linux kernel, systems and embedded developers can use <a href="https://docs.perfetto.dev/">Perfetto</a> when debugging and root-causing performance issues in their respective domains. Even though the Perfetto UI is primarily built for viewing <a href="https://perfetto.dev/docs/#why-would-you-use-perfetto-">Android or Chrome traces</a>, it is a flexible tool and can be used in many other ways!</p><p>The talk was recorded and is available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzTwul2Qb3g">YouTube</a>. Taking inspiration from <a href="https://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison</a>, this post is an <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/6/annotated-presentations/">annotated presentation</a> containing my slides and detailed notes on them. The talk also has a lot of UI demos: for these, I’ll have a screenshot but also a link to the relevant part of the video (videos are unbeatable for UI!).</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzTwul2Qb3g" title="TS2025 - Perfetto: The Swiss Army Knife of Linux Client/Embedded Tracing" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><hr><p>First, what is Perfetto? Perfetto is fundamentally a suite of tools: it’s not just one thing but a bunch of different tools working together to help you debug and root-cause problems. This diagram shows how everything fits together, with the core parts of the Perfetto project in the center.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/perfetto-swiss-army-03.jpg" alt="diagram of all the pieces of Perfetto, Recording tools, protobuf format, trace processor, Perfetto UI, Python API, Format converters. Chrome JSON, Other profiling formats"></p></center><p>The recording tools for Perfetto consist of 1) an <a href="https://perfetto.dev/docs/getting-started/in-app-tracing">SDK for C++ apps</a> 2) a <a href="https://perfetto.dev/docs/getting-started/system-tracing">daemon</a> that can collect data from ftrace, /proc, /sys, and various kernel interfaces 3) another <a href="https://perfetto.dev/docs/concepts/service-model">daemon</a> that amalgamates trace data from multiple processes into a single trace file. These tools all speak the Perfetto <a href="https://perfetto.dev/docs/getting-started/converting">protobuf format</a>, a high-performance trace format designed to be very efficient to write but not to analyze or consume directly.</p><p>That’s where the <a href="https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/trace-processor">trace processor</a> comes in. It’s a C++ library that parses the protobuf format, but also a bunch of other widely used trace formats. It exposes this data via an SQL query interface to any embedding program including <a href="https://perfetto.dev/docs/visualization/perfetto-ui">Perfetto UI</a> (which is what most of this talk is about) and also to the <a href="https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/trace-processor-python">Python API</a> if you want to do ad-hoc scripting or analysis in Python.</p><p>There are also very common tracing/profiling formats used by the Linux community: perf.data, ftrace text format, Firefox profiler format, and many others. Perfetto <a href="https://perfetto.dev/docs/getting-started/other-formats">supports</a> quite a few of those directly. There’s also the Chrome JSON format (AKA the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvAClvFfyA5R-PhYUmn5OOQtYMH4h6I0nSsKchNAySU/preview?tab=t.0">Trace Event Format</a>) which is a simpler interchange format. It’s not the most efficient to read or write, but it does the job for a lot of use cases.</p><p>Often people write <a href="https://perfetto.dev/docs/getting-started/converting">converters</a>. They have their own tracing format, maybe proprietary, maybe open source but something we don’t know about, and it’s very common that people convert to one of the formats we understand, most commonly our protobuf or Chrome JSON formats.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/perfetto-swiss-army-04.jpg" alt="Slide showing Perfetto UI architecture with web-based trace visualizer features"></p></center><p>The <a href="https://perfetto.dev/docs/visualization/perfetto-ui">Perfetto UI</a> is fundamentally a web-based trace visualizer, combining timeline visualization, user-driven selection/aggregation, and SQL queries all in one interface. Because it has the trace processor as a backend, it works with a bunch of different trace formats.</p><p>It’s very important to note that even though the Perfetto UI is web-based, everything happens inside your browser and trace data never leaves your system. You can even <a href="https://perfetto.dev/docs/contributing/ui-getting-started">build it</a> and host it yourself on any static server: we’ve made it extremely easy to do so!</p><p>At the start of 2025, we actually moved our whole development to GitHub. In the past, we used to develop on Android and GitHub was just a mirror. That’s no longer the case, GitHub is actually where we develop and take pull requests.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/perfetto-swiss-army-05.jpg" alt="Slide introducing the fractal renderer demo program with Vulkan and multi-threading"></p></center><p>Most of this talk, I’m going to spend actually showing you how you can use the Perfetto UI to debug performance issues on Linux. I don’t want to show you an Android trace which needs a lot of context about how the Android system works and so you think, “oh, that was cool, but I didn’t really understand what was happening.”</p><p>So to make this talk more approachable, I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/fractal-renderer-vk">straightforward demo program</a> you can look at yourself! So it’s obviously not a production system but I’ve tried to make it as representative of the sort of issues we use Perfetto for every day.</p><p>It’s a Rust program which generates a Julia set and visualizes it over time. The technologies I used: <a href="https://vulkano.rs/">Vulkan</a>, GPU rendering and also multi-threaded CPU computation. So how it works is that computation of various parameters is happening on background threads, and then that’s being passed to the main thread for rendering.</p><p>And then, for demonstration purposes, there is a performance bug; rendering should run at 60 FPS, but every so often, the frame rate drops dramatically. Here’s what that looks like:</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/test.avif" alt="Animated visualization of Julia set fractal renderer showing frame rate drops"></p></center><p>The code is on <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/fractal-renderer-vk">GitHub</a> and if you’re interested in following along. The traces are there as well - you don’t have to collect the traces yourself, but you can if you want. All the instructions and information is in the README.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/perfetto-swiss-army-06.jpg" alt="Slide titled “Suspicion #1: Maybe it’s a CPU problem?” with perf command examples"></p></center><p>So the first suspicion we may have is that maybe it’s some CPU problem. A lot of engineers I know would reach for perf immediately whenever they see a problem like this. The main reason is that if perf can capture the problem, they can go straight to the line of code without needing to spend time debugging using more complex approaches.</p><p>You can record a perf profile with <code>perf record -k mono -g ./fractal_renderer</code>. The standard post-processing step which I think a lot of people do would be to <a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph">generate</a> an SVG flame graph out of this with <code>perf script | stack-collapse-perf.pl --all | flamegraph.pl &gt; fractal-frame.svg</code>. Here’s how that looks like for our perf profile:</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/fractal.svg" alt="Interactive flame graph showing CPU profiling data with thread names and function call stacks dominated by cos and sin operations"></p><p><em>See also the <a href="https://lalitm.com/img/fractal.svg">interactive version of the profile</a></em></p></center><p>The flame graph shows the thread names at the bottom, and then stacked above are the call stacks of what the program is doing. The width represents how much time is spent in each function. In this case, the worker threads are spending most of their time in&nbsp;<code>cos</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>sin</code>&nbsp;operations, doing math computation. Exactly what you’d expect for this type of program. <em>Aside: Interestingly demangling didn’t seem to work for Rust out of the box which I find a bit unusual but I didn’t dig too much into why this was.</em></p><p>Looking at this, nothing really stands out. There’s no smoking gun that immediately reveals the problem. But here’s the fundamental limitation: the flame graph aggregates data across the entire trace, losing the time dimension. The performance problem we’re seeing happens every 2-3 seconds - brief drops in an otherwise normally functioning program.</p><p>The flame graph shows me the aggregate, dominated by the correct behavior, making it nearly impossible to spot those occasional problematic moments. So how do I find the places where it’s doing the wrong thing?</p><p>Well, that’s maybe where Perfetto can help you out a little bit! The thing I find lots of people don’t know is that perf actually <em>preserves</em> timestamp information about when samples were taken: many tools drop this information but Perfetto is pretty good at showing that to you. I just need post-process the trace with <code>perf script &gt; fractal.perftext</code> to generate a text version of the profile which we can then open in the <a href="https://ui.perfetto.dev/">Perfetto UI</a></p><p><em>My demo talking through how to open the perf profile and navigate it starts at <a href="https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=551">9:11</a> in the video.</em></p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/screenshot3.png" alt="Perfetto UI screenshot showing perf profile timeline with thread tracks and CPU sample markers across time axis"></p><p><em>Screenshot from <a href="https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=590">9:50</a> in the video</em></p></center><p>The x-axis of what you’re seeing is time. And every horizontal line represents a thread: we call these lanes “tracks”. And each of the small arrowheads on the tracks are CPU samples for the associated thread.</p><p>The behavior of the worker threads over time is really interesting. Most of the lifetime of the program, it’s doing continuous computation, basically. And then there’s this period of time in the middle where there’s this very interesting staircase pattern where it seems like only one thread is running at any one time: we’ll want to keep a note of this as this is quite important.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/screenshot4.png" alt="Perfetto UI screenshot demonstrating area selection feature with timeline selection and flame graph visualization below"></p><p><em>Screenshot from <a href="https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=637">10:37</a> in the video</em></p></center><p>One very cool thing about Perfetto is that it allows me to quickly generate visualizations of whatever I’m selecting on the timeline. We call this “area selection” and it’s where I drag my mouse and select a region both horizontally and vertically. This is on one track but even <em>across</em> multiple tracks. So in the timeline it shows me the selection I’m making at the top, plus a flame graph at the bottom representing the aggregation of the samples in just that time period.</p><p>The key advantage is that I can look at individual regions of time interactively. You can also do this with <code>flamegraph.pl</code> but you need to pre-filter the data to what you’re looking for. This assumes you already know what the problem is before you find it. I always find that a bit counterintuitive. I prefer this view where I can see everything first, then decide “I want to look at this specific part in more detail.” That’s what Perfetto lets me do.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/screenshot5.png" alt="Perfetto UI screenshot showing enhanced flame graph with zoom, frame hiding, regex search, and bottom-up view features"></p><p><em>Screenshot from <a href="https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=751">12:31</a> in the video</em></p></center><p>So now on to the flame graph itself: in the last year, I spent a bunch of time on improving the flame graph visualization in Perfetto UI. At Google, we have an internal tool called pprof (related to but not the same as the open-source one), and I’ve always loved the visualization it has. So I worked to make Perfetto’s flame graph look and behave very similarly.</p><p>There are a bunch of features here. You can zoom in like most flame graph, but you can also say “I only want to look at the stack starting from this point” — it gets rid of everything above and starts fresh from there. If I don’t want to see a particular function like <code>sin</code>, I can just hide the frame and it gets merged into its parent. The search is regex-based so I can also just type the specific things I’m interested in: it’s pretty powerful.</p><p>There’s also something I don’t think I’ve seen in other visualizers (I might be wrong, please do correct me!): what I call “bottom up” view. Imagine you take all the leaves across your entire program and visualize who’s calling into them. If you have a leaf function that’s called everywhere in your program but reached from many different places, it’ll be split across your flame chart. This is the inverse — you’re looking at the leaves and asking “who is calling me?” This is particularly useful when you’re trying to optimize very low-level functions that are always at the leaf level — things like memcpy or hashmap operations.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/perfetto-swiss-army-07.jpg" alt="Slide titled “Suspicion #2: Sleeping on what?” discussing need for scheduler trace analysis"></p></center><p>So our main takeaway is that our worker threads all had gaps in their CPU execution in a staircase pattern. This means the threads weren’t actually on the CPU and that’s usually a sign that they’re sleeping.</p><p>But sleeping on what? Locks? Disk? Network? What exactly is happening? To answer that, I need a scheduler trace to show me the wake-up patterns, who’s being scheduled when, what type of sleep threads are in, that sort of thing.</p><p>We recently added support for trace-cmd’s text format in Perfetto (<em>aside: <a href="https://github.com/google/perfetto/issues/1819">there’s</a> an open issue to support the binary format too!</em>). For this demo, I’m collecting sched_switch and sched_waking events with <code>sudo trace-cmd record -e sched:sched_switch -e sched:sched_waking -C mono ./fractal-renderer-vk</code> and we can open it in the UI once we do <code>trace-cmd report -N &gt; fractal.sched</code>.</p><p><em>The demo showing off scheduler traces starts at <a href="https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=916">15:16</a> in the video.</em></p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/screenshot6.png" alt="Perfetto UI screenshot showing scheduler trace with CPU scheduling tracks at top, white regions indicating idle time"></p><p><em>Screenshot from <a href="https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=950">15:49</a> in the video</em></p></center><p>So this is what a scheduler trace looks like. Again as before, the x-axis is time. At the top of the trace, you’ve got the CPU scheduling tracks. For each CPU, they tell us what was scheduled on that CPU at each point in time. The white regions are where there’s nothing scheduled. As I zoom in, you start to see information like the name of the thread that’s scheduled, the TID of the thread, and so on. This is the CPU view of things, looking at it from a CPU perspective.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/screenshot7.png" alt="Perfetto UI screenshot showing thread state tracks with dark green for running, light green for runnable, and white for interruptible sleep"></p><p><em>Screenshot from <a href="https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=1008">16:48</a> in the video</em></p></center><p>There’s also a thread perspective on scheduling: what we call this “thread state”. This shows the scheduling state of each thread at every point in time. Dark green represents the thread running, light green represents runnable (the thread is on the runqueue so it’s eligible to run, but the scheduler hasn’t actually let it run yet), and white represents interruptible sleep (S sleep). There are also orange regions for uninterruptible sleep (D sleep), though that doesn’t show up much in this trace.</p><p>You can again see a very clear staircase-like pattern. Again, only one thread seems to be running at any one time. You’re maybe getting the sense of what the problem might be at this point.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/screenshot8.png" alt="Perfetto UI screenshot showing area selection on CPU track with tables displaying time spent by each thread"></p><p><em>Screenshot from <a href="https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=1063">17:43</a> in the video</em></p></center><p>Like with the perf visualization, you can do area selections here too. I can select a region on a CPU and get tables showing time spent by each thread (shown in the screenshot above). I can also do this for thread state, you can also see that runnable time is basically negligible compared to running and sleeping, which is where most of the time is being spent.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/screenshot9.png" alt="Perfetto UI screenshot showing scheduler visualizations including run queue length and active CPU count metrics"></p><p><em>Screenshot from <a href="https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=1092">18:12</a> in the video</em></p></center><p>There are also scheduler-specific visualizations like run queue length and active CPU count. You can see in the problematic region, the active CPU count also went down, which makes sense.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/perfetto-swiss-army-08.jpg" alt="Slide titled “Suspicion #3: What is the program doing?” discussing need for application-level visibility"></p></center><p>So the scheduler trace shows when threads are sleeping, but it’s not telling us why. What was the program doing in that region? What code was it running? The sequential pattern suggests some sort of serialization—something is causing only one thread to run at a time. But we need application-level visibility.</p><p>Since this program was written in Rust, I just used the off-the-shelf <a href="https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/"><code>tracing</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/tracing-perfetto/latest/tracing_perfetto/"><code>tracing-perfetto</code></a> crates; I did have to make some small <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/tracing-perfetto">modifications</a> to tracing-perfetto that I’m hoping to upstream. These output a Perfetto trace without needing to use the Perfetto SDK. These libraries are also maintained by others: we don’t have any hand in them.</p><p>All I needed to do was integrate these into my program and then add a command line switch to write out the collected trace to a file. So I just do <code>./fractal_renderer --trace fractal.pftrace</code></p><p><em>My demo for app tracing starts at <a href="https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=1177">19:37</a> in the video.</em></p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/screenshot10.png" alt="Perfetto UI screenshot showing app trace with userspace instrumentation slices on thread tracks representing program activity"></p><p><em>Screenshot from <a href="https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=1206">20:06</a> in the video</em></p></center><p>Looking at the app trace: as before x-axis is time and each of the tracks represents a thread. Instead of scheduling activity or CPU stack samples, this time the tracks is userspace instrumentation of the program itself. Each of these rectangles is a named period of time representing what the program was doing at that time.</p><p>There are lots of different names for these in the tracing world (e.g. spans, intervals) but we call these “slices”. The main thread is rendering frames as you would expect and the workers are each computing tiles of that frame, which eventually feed back to the main thread and sync to the GPU.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/screenshot11.png" alt="Perfetto UI screenshot showing flow visualization with causal links between render frame and worker thread operations"></p><p><em>Screenshot from <a href="https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=1425">23:42</a> in the video</em></p></center><p>There’s also this thing called flows, which shows the causal links between different pieces. Render frame is calling into all these places and causing them to happen. It’s sort of similar to wakeup graphs but for user space: basically, this is what caused me to start running this function.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/screenshot12.png" alt="Perfetto UI screenshot zoomed into problematic region showing 1.8 second duration for update adaptive quality operation"></p><p><em>Screenshot from <a href="https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=1431">23:51</a> in the video</em></p></center><p>So you can see very clearly there’s a normal region and then a region where things are taking 1.8 seconds: almost certainly the cause of the frame drops.</p><p>And if we look at the slice in question, it seems to be doing something called “update adaptive quality.” Basically, I wrote some code to dynamically change the rendering quality based on frame rate. If I’m running faster, I can render at higher quality. If I’m running slower, I can do lower quality. That’s what this adaptive quality thing is supposed to do.</p><p>But clearly something has gone wrong. I’m causing frame drops because of updates to adaptive quality. A little bit ironic, to say the least. Now we know what the program is actually doing during that time span.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/perfetto-swiss-army-09.jpg" alt="Slide titled “Putting it all together: The merged trace” explaining trace merging feature"></p></center><p>So now we’ve looked at three different sources of debugging data separately. In perf, we got told there are few or no CPU samples and weird staircase patterns. In ftrace, we saw only one worker seems to be active and the rest are sleeping in interruptible sleep. And in app tracing, we see it’s because of adaptive quality updates that workers are working on, and they shouldn’t be doing it this way.</p><p>Obviously, the theory is that it’s all the same problem. But we can confirm this theory with a very new (and still experimental) feature of the UI: trace merging.</p><p><em>Note: as this part of Perfetto is still experimental, if you want to try it yourself, you need to go to plugins and enable the “MultiTraceOpen” plugin. Also, unlike I what say in the talk, you do <strong>not</strong> need to be on Autopush as all the features I showed in my talk are now available in Stable.</em></p><p><em>The demo showing off merged traces starts at <a href="https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=1472">24:32</a> in the video.</em></p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/screenshot13.png" alt="Perfetto UI screenshot showing merged trace with CPU scheduling tracks, stack samples, and app instrumentation on single timeline"></p><p><em>Screenshot from <a href="https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=1544">25:44</a> in the video</em></p></center><p>This is now the merged trace file containing all the different information. You can see the CPU scheduling tracks like we had in the scheduler trace, the stack samples like we had in the perf trace, and the app instrumentation, all beside each other on one timeline.
You can very clearly see the adaptive quality update running, then this period where it ran, and then it was done. It’s very cool to be able to see the pattern of how my program is sleeping and where and what it was running on one timeline.</p><p>The thing is, you’ve always been able to do this with Perfetto if you collect a Perfetto trace with all of these integrated. The new capability is that this is now being brought to traces you didn’t collect with Perfetto. Collect it with whatever you like, and we’ll still manage to do this visualization. That’s the new capability we have.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/screenshot14.png" alt="Perfetto UI screenshot showing query interface with pivot tables and filter options for trace data analysis"></p><p><em>Screenshot from <a href="https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=1798">29:58</a> in the video</em></p></center><p>There’s also a query interface which we’ve been building out recently and there are some pretty powerful things you can do with these tables. As well as the flat tables of data, there’s also a more dynamic pivot table and if I click the arrow on the left, I can get into a detailed filter table, similar to a spreadsheet but optimize for things people want to do on traces.</p><p>For example, by doing an area select, I can first get a list of all the events that happened during a time region. Then using the table I can filter for things - say I only care about slices longer than some duration, like 319 microseconds for whatever reason. I can click and add a filter for things greater than this.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/screenshot15.png" alt="Perfetto UI screenshot demonstrating Show Debug Track feature with filtered events visualized as timeline track"></p><p><em>Screenshot from <a href="https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=1811">30:11</a> in the video</em></p></center><p>There’s also a feature called “Show Debug Track” that’s also very powerful. The table shows rows with timestamped duration information, and this feature lets you visualize that data as a track on the timeline. It adds a track at the top showing the regions of time where these events happened—in this case, where ComputeTile took longer than a certain threshold.</p><p>This is particularly useful for correlation analysis. For example, in Android, we’re often looking at system A and trying to understand its effect on system B. We find all the places where one thing is slow, then look for correlations. Being able to see a track in the UI where you can quickly have context and say “oh, during this period of time, this other thing was happening” is invaluable. It’s probably one of our most-used features.</p><p>You can also copy the SQL query from these tables and start doing your own aggregations on top of it. This eases the burden of starting with a completely blank canvas. Instead of wondering “where do I even start querying my data? What tables is my data in?”, the UI gives you a starting query that you can build on without needing to write something from scratch.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/perfetto-swiss-army-10.jpg" alt="Slide titled “The root cause” summarizing findings about dynamic quality updates causing frame drops"></p></center><p>So the dynamic quality updates were stopping the world. Perf profiling showed the problem, scheduler traces found the sleeping pattern, app tracing confirmed it was the quality adjustment code, and the single timeline view let me see everything happening at once.</p><p>Interestingly, I tried to fix this by removing the lock contention—which I thought was the bug I had introduced. But it turns out I shouldn’t have been doing this code in the workers in the first place. Even after removing the lock contention, just the CPU activity of doing that work was enough to cause frame drops. The right solution was to move it to a background thread. As part of debugging this for the demo, I discovered something even better that I could be doing.</p><center><p><img src="https://lalitm.com/img/perfetto-swiss-army-11.jpg" alt="Slide titled “Perfetto in the Open-Source Community” listing projects using Perfetto including Mesa, VizTracer, pthread_trace, magic-trace, sched-analyzer, and systing"></p></center><ul><li><p><a href="https://docs.perfetto.dev/">Android and Chrome</a> are our bread and butter—that’s what we officially support as a team, and why Google staffs us.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Did you know that most modern passports are actually embedded devices containing an entire filesystem, access controls, and support for several cryptographic protocols? Such passports display a small symbol indicating an electronic machine-readable travel document (eMRTD), which digitally stores the same personal data printed in traditional passport booklets in its embedded filesystem. Beyond allowing travelers in some countries to skip a chat at border control, these documents use cryptography to prevent unauthorized reading, eavesdropping, forgery, and copying.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/passports_figure_1.png" alt="Image showing the Chip Inside symbol"><figcaption>Figure 1: Chip Inside symbol (ICAO Doc 9303 Part 9)</figcaption></figure><p>This blog post describes how electronic passports work, the threats within their threat model, and how they protect against those threats using cryptography. It also discusses the implications of using electronic passports for novel applications, such as zero-knowledge identity proofs. Like many widely used electronic devices with long lifetimes, electronic passports and the systems interacting with them support insecure, legacy protocols that put passport holders at risk for both standard and novel use cases.</p><h2 id="electronic-passport-basics">Electronic passport basics</h2><p>A passport serves as official identity documentation, primarily for international travel. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines the standards for electronic passports, which (as suggested by the “Chip Inside” symbol) contain a contactless integrated circuit (IC) storing digital information. Essentially, the chip contains a filesystem with some access control to protect unauthorized reading of data. The full technical details of electronic passports are specified in <a href="https://www.icao.int/publications/doc-series/doc-9303">ICAO Doc 9303</a>; this blog post will mostly focus on part 10, which specifies the logical data structure (LDS), and part 11, which specifies the security mechanisms.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/passports_figure_2.png" alt="Flowchart showning electronic passport logical data structure"><figcaption>Figure 2: Electronic passport logical data structure (ICAO Doc 9303 Part 10)</figcaption></figure><p>The filesystem architecture is straightforward, comprising three file types: master files (MFs) serving as the root directory; dedicated files (DFs) functioning as subdirectories or applications; and elementary files (EFs) containing actual binary data. As shown in the above figure, some files are mandatory, whereas others are optional. This blog post will focus on the eMRTD application. The other applications are part of LDS 2.0, which would allow the digital storage of travel records (digital stamps!), electronic visas, and additional biometrics (so you can just update your picture instead of getting a whole new passport!).</p><h3 id="how-the-emrtd-application-works">How the eMRTD application works</h3><p>The following figure shows the types of files the eMRTD contains:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/passports_figure_3.png" alt="Image showing the contents of the eMRTD application"><figcaption>Figure 3: Contents of the eMRTD application (ICAO Doc 9303 Part 10)</figcaption></figure><p>There are generic files containing common or security-related data; all other files are so-called data groups (DGs), which primarily contain personal information (most of which is also printed on your passport) and some additional security data that will become important later. All electronic passports must contain DGs 1 and 2, whereas the rest is optional.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/passports_figure_4.png" alt="Image showing DGs in the LDS"><figcaption>Figure 4: DGs in the LDS (ICAO Doc 9303 Part 10, seventh edition)</figcaption></figure><p>Comparing the contents of DG1 and DG2 to the main passport page shows that most of the written data is stored in DG1 and the photo is stored in DG2. Additionally, there are two lines of characters at the bottom of the page called the machine readable zone (MRZ), which contains another copy of the DG1 data with some check digits, as shown in the following picture.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/passports_figure_5.png" alt="Image showing an example passport with MRZ"><figcaption>Figure 5: Example passport with MRZ (ICAO Doc 9303 Part 3)</figcaption></figure><h2 id="digging-into-the-threat-model">Digging into the threat model</h2><p>Electronic passports operate under a straightforward threat model that categorizes attackers based on physical access: those who hold a passport versus those who don’t. If you are near a passport but you do not hold it in your possession, you should not be able to do any of the following:</p><ul><li>Read any personal information from that passport</li><li>Eavesdrop on communication that the passport has with legitimate terminals</li><li>Figure out whether it is a specific passport so you can trace its movements<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li></ul><p>Even if you do hold one or more passports, you should not be able to do the following:</p><ul><li>Forge a new passport with inauthentic data</li><li>Make a digital copy of the passport</li><li>Read the fingerprint (DG3) or iris (DG4) information<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li></ul><p>Electronic passports use short-range RFID for communication (ISO 14443). You can communicate with a passport within a distance of 10–15 centimeters, but eavesdropping is possible at distances of several meters<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Because electronic passports are embedded devices, they need to be able to withstand attacks where the attacker has physical access to the device, such as elaborate side-channel and fault injection attacks. As a result, they are often certified (e.g., under Common Criteria).</p><p>We focus here on the threats against the electronic components of the passport. Passports have many physical countermeasures, such as visual effects that become visible under certain types of light. Even if someone can break the electronic security that prevents copying passports, they would still have to defeat these physical measures to make a full copy of the passport. That said, some systems (such as online systems) only interact digitally with the passport, so they do not perform any physical checks at all.</p><h2 id="cryptographic-mechanisms">Cryptographic mechanisms</h2><p>The earliest electronic passports lacked most cryptographic mechanisms. Malaysia issued the first electronic passport in 1998, which predates the first ICAO eMRTD specifications from 2003. Belgium subsequently issued the first ICAO-compliant eMRTD in 2004, which in turn predates the first cryptographic mechanism for confidentiality specified in 2005.</p><p>While we could focus solely on the most advanced cryptographic implementations, electronic passports remain in circulation for extended periods (typically 5–10 years), meaning legacy systems continue operating alongside modern solutions. This means that there are typically many old passports floating around that do not support the latest and greatest access control mechanisms<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Similarly, not all inspection systems/terminals support all of the protocols, which means passports potentially need to support multiple protocols. All protocols discussed in the following are described in more detail in ICAO Doc 9303 Part 11.</p><h3 id="legacy-cryptography">Legacy cryptography</h3><p>Legacy protection mechanisms for electronic passports provide better security than what they were replacing (nothing), even though they have key shortcomings regarding confidentiality and (to a lesser extent) copying.</p><h4 id="legacy-confidentiality-protections-how-basic-access-control-fails">Legacy confidentiality protections: How basic access control fails</h4><p>In order to prevent eavesdropping, you need to set up a secure channel. Typically, this is done by deriving a shared symmetric key, either from some shared knowledge, or through a key exchange. However, the passport cannot have its own static public key and send it over the communication channel, because this would enable tracing of specific passports.</p><p>Additionally, it should only be possible to set up this secure channel if you have the passport in your possession. So, what sets holders apart from others? Holders can read the physical passport page that contains the MRZ!</p><p>This brings us to the original solution to set up a secure channel with electronic passports: basic access control (BAC). When you place your passport with the photo page face down into an inspection system at the airport, it scans the page and reads the MRZ. Now, both sides derive encryption and message authentication code (MAC) keys from parts of the MRZ data using SHA-1 as a KDF. Then, they exchange freshly generated challenges and encrypt-then-MAC these challenges together with some fresh keying material to prove that both sides know the key. Finally, they derive session keys from the keying material and use them to set up the secure channel.</p><p>However, BAC fails to achieve any of its security objectives. The static MRZ is just some personal data and does not have very high entropy, which makes it guessable. Even worse, if you capture one valid exchange between passport and terminal, you can brute-force the MRZ offline by computing a bunch of unhardened hashes. Moreover, passive listeners who know the MRZ can decrypt all communications with the passport. Finally, the fact that the passport has to check both the MAC and the challenge has opened up the potential for <a href="https://www.ifca.ai/pub/fc10/17_43.pdf">oracle attacks that allow tracing</a> by replaying valid terminal responses.</p><h4 id="forgery-prevention-got-it-right-the-first-time">Forgery prevention: Got it right the first time</h4><p>Preventing forgery is relatively simple. The passport contains a file called the Document Security Object (EF.SOD), which contains a list of hashes of all the Data Groups, and a signature over all these hashes. This signature comes from a key pair that has a certificate chain back to the Country Signing Certificate Authority (CSCA). The private key associated with the CSCA certificate is one of the most valuable assets in this system, because anyone in possession of this private key<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> can issue legitimate passports containing arbitrary data.</p><p>The process of reading the passport, comparing all contents to the SOD, and verifying the signature and certificate chain is called passive authentication (PA). This will prove that the data in the passport was signed by the issuing country. However, it does nothing to prevent the copying of existing passports: anyone who can read a passport can copy its data into a new chip and it will pass PA. While this mechanism is listed among the legacy ones, it meets all of its objectives and is therefore still used without changes.</p><h4 id="legacy-copying-protections-they-work-but-some-issues-remain">Legacy copying protections: They work, but some issues remain</h4><p>Preventing copying requires having something in the passport that cannot be read or extracted, like the private key of a key pair. But how does a terminal know that a key pair belongs to a genuine passport? Since countries are already signing the contents of the passport for PA, they can just put the public key in one of the data groups (DG15), and use the private key to sign challenges that the terminal sends. This is called active authentication (AA). After performing both PA and AA, the terminal knows that the data in the passport (including the AA public key) was signed by the government and that the passport contains the corresponding private key.</p><p>This solution has two issues: the AA signature is not tied to the secure channel, so you can relay a signature and pretend that the passport is somewhere it’s not. Additionally, the passport signs an arbitrary challenge without knowing the semantics of this message, which is generally considered a dangerous practice in cryptography<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="modern-enhancements">Modern enhancements</h3><p>Extended Access Control (EAC) fixes some of the issues related to BAC and AA. It comprises chip authentication (CA), which is a better AA, and terminal authentication (TA), which authenticates the terminal to the passport in order to protect access to the sensitive information stored in DG3 (fingerprint) and DG4 (iris). Finally, password authenticated connection establishment (PACE<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, described below) replaces BAC altogether, eliminating its weaknesses.</p><h4 id="chip-authentication-upgrading-the-secure-channel">Chip Authentication: Upgrading the secure channel</h4><p>CA is very similar to AA in the sense that it requires countries to simply store a public key in one of the DGs (DG14), which is then authenticated using PA. However, instead of signing a challenge, the passport uses the key pair to perform a static-ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange with the terminal, and uses the resulting keys to upgrade the secure channel from BAC. This means that passive listeners that know the MRZ cannot eavesdrop after doing CA, because they were not part of the key exchange.</p><h4 id="terminal-authentication-protecting-sensitive-data-in-dg3-and-dg4">Terminal Authentication: Protecting sensitive data in DG3 and DG4</h4><p>Similar to the CSCA for signing things, each country has a Country Verification Certificate Authority (CVCA), which creates a root certificate for a PKI that authorizes terminals to read DG3 and DG4 in the passports of that country. Terminals provide a certificate chain for their public key and sign a challenge provided by the passport using their private key. The CVCA can authorize document verifiers (DVs) to read one or both of DG3 and DG4, which is encoded in the certificate. The DV then issues certificates to individual terminals. Without such a certificate, it is not possible to access the sensitive data in DG3 and DG4.</p><h4 id="password-authenticated-connection-establishment-fixing-the-basic-problems">Password Authenticated Connection Establishment: Fixing the basic problems</h4><p>The main idea behind PACE is that the MRZ, much like a password, does not have sufficient entropy to protect the data it contains. Therefore, it should not be used directly to derive keys, because this would enable offline brute-force attacks. PACE can work with various mappings, but we describe only the simplest one in the following, which is the generic mapping. Likewise, PACE can work with other passwords besides the MRZ (such as a PIN), but this blog post focuses on the MRZ.</p><p>First, both sides use the MRZ data (the password) to derive<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> a password key. Next, the passport encrypts<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> a nonce using the password key and sends it to the terminal, which can decrypt it if it knows the password. The terminal and passport also perform an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Now, both terminal and passport derive a new generator of the elliptic curve by applying the nonce as an additive tweak to the (EC)DH shared secret<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Using this new generator, the terminal and passport perform another (EC)DH to get a second shared secret. Finally, they use this second shared secret to derive session keys, which are used to authenticate the (EC)DH public keys that they used earlier on in the protocol, and to set up the secure channel. Figure 6 shows a simplified protocol diagram.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/passports_figure_6.png" alt="Simplified protocol diagram for PACE"><figcaption>Figure 6: Simplified protocol diagram for PACE</figcaption></figure><p>Anyone who does not know the password cannot follow the protocol to the end, which will become apparent in the final step when they need to authenticate the data with the session keys. Before authenticating the terminal, the passport does not share any data that enables brute-forcing the password key. Non-participants who do know the password cannot derive the session keys because they do not know the ECDH private keys.</p><h2 id="gaps-in-the-threat-model-why-you-shouldnt-give-your-passport-to-just-anyone">Gaps in the threat model: Why you shouldn’t give your passport to just anyone</h2><p>When considering potential solutions to maintaining passports’ confidentiality and authenticity, it’s important to account for what the inspection system <em>does</em> with your passport, and not just the fancy cryptography the passport supports. If an inspection system performs only BAC/PACE and PA, anyone who has seen your passport could make an electronic copy and pretend to be you when interacting with this system. This is true even if your passport supports AA or CA.</p><p>Another important factor is tracing: the specifications aim to ensure that someone who does not know a passport’s PACE password (MRZ data in most cases) cannot trace that passport’s movements by interacting with it or eavesdropping on communications it has with legitimate terminals. They attempt to achieve this by ensuring that passports always provide random identifiers (e.g., as part of Type A or Type B ISO 14443 contactless communication protocols) and that the contents of publicly accessible files (e.g., those containing information necessary for performing PACE) are the same for every citizen of a particular country.</p><p>However, all of these protections go out of the window when the attacker knows the password. If you are entering another country and border control scans your passport, they can provide your passport contents to others, enabling them to track the movements of your passport. If you <a href="https://cert-agid.gov.it/news/in-vendita-documenti-di-identita-trafugati-da-hotel-italiani/">visit a hotel in Italy and they store a scan of your passport and get hacked</a>, anyone with access to this information can track your passport. This method can be a bit onerous, as it requires contacting various nearby contactless communication devices and trying to authenticate to them as if they were your passport. However, some may still choose to include it in their threat models.</p><p>Some countries state in their issued passports that the holder should give it to someone else only if there is a statutory need. At Italian hotels, for example, it is sufficient to provide a prepared copy of the passport’s photo page with most data redacted (such as your photo, signature, and any personal identification numbers). In practice, not many people do this.</p><p>Even without the passport, the threat model says nothing about tracking particular groups of people. Countries typically buy large quantities of the same electronic passports, which comprise a combination of an IC and the embedded software implementing the passport specifications. This means that people from the same country likely have the same model of passport, with a unique fingerprint comprising characteristics like communication time, execution time<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>, supported protocols (ISO 14443 Type A vs Type B), etc. Furthermore, each country may use different parameters for PACE (supported curves or mappings, etc.), which may aid an attacker in fingerprinting different types of passports, as these parameters are stored in publicly readable files.</p><h2 id="security-and-privacy-implications-of-zero-knowledge-identity-proofs">Security and privacy implications of zero-knowledge identity proofs</h2><p>An emerging approach in both academic research and industry applications involves using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs with identity documents, enabling verification of specific identity attributes without revealing complete document contents. This is a nice idea in theory, because this will allow proper use of passports where there is no statutory need to hand over your passport. However, there are security implications.</p><p>First of all, passports cannot generate ZK proofs by themselves, so this necessarily involves exposing your passport to a prover. Letting anyone or anything read your passport means that you downgrade your threat model with respect to that entity. So when you provide your passport to an app or website for the purposes of creating a ZK proof, you need to consider what they will do with the information in your passport. Will it be processed locally on your device, or will it be sent to a server? If the data leaves your device, will it be encrypted and only handled inside a trusted execution environment (TEE)? If so, has this whole stack been audited, including against malicious TEE operators?</p><p>Second, if the ZK proving service relies on PA for its proofs, then anyone who has ever seen your passport can pretend to be you on this service. Full security requires AA or CA. As long as there exists any service that relies only on PA, anyone whose passport data is exposed is vulnerable to impersonation. Even if the ZK proving service does not incorporate AA or CA in their proofs, they should still perform one of these procedures with the passport to ensure that only legitimate passports sign up for this service<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</p><p>Finally, the system needs to consider what happens when people share their ZK proof with others. The nice thing about a passport is that you cannot easily make copies (if AA or CA is used), but if I can allow others to use my ZK proof, then the value of the identification decreases.</p><p>It is important that such systems are audited for security, both from the point of view of the user and the service provider.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/">https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45770304">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
  <p>I have been using a MacBook Pro M4 as my portable computer for the last half a
year and wanted to share a few short impressions. As always, I am not a
professional laptop reviewer, so in this article you won’t find benchmarks, just
subjective thoughts!</p>
<p>Back in 2021, I wrote about the <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2021-11-28-macbook-air-m1/">MacBook Air
M1</a>, which was the first computer I used that
contained Apple’s own ARM-based CPU. Having a silent laptop with long battery
life was a game-changer, so I wanted to keep those properties.</p>
<p>When the US government announced tariffs, I figured I would replace my 4-year
old MacBook Air M1 with a more recent model that should last a few more
years. Ultimately, Apple’s prices remained stable, so, in retrospect, I could
have stayed with the M1 for a few more years. Oh well.</p>
<h2 id="the-nano-textured-display">The nano-textured display</h2>
<p>I went to the Apple Store to compare the different options in
person. Specifically, I was curious about the display and whether the increased
weight and form factor of the MacBook Pro (compared to a MacBook Air) would be
acceptable. Another downside of the Pro model is that it comes with a fan, and I
really like absolutely quiet computers. Online, I read from other MacBook Pro
owners that the fan mostly stays off.</p>
<p>In general, I would have preferred to go with a MacBook Air because it has
enough compute power for my needs and I like the case better (no ventilation
slots), but unfortunately only the MacBook Pro line has the better displays.</p>
<p>Why aren’t all displays nano-textured? The employee at the Apple Store presented
the trade-off as follows: The nano texture display is great at reducing
reflections, at the expense of also making the picture slightly less vibrant.</p>
<p>I could immediately see the difference when placing two laptops side by side:
The bright Apple Store lights showed up very prominently on the normal display
(left), and were almost not visible at all on the nano texture display (right):</p>















<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays.jpg"><img srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays_hu_8c87fe476c5344b6.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays_hu_243730d5507ecc98.jpg 3x" src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays_hu_4cb7e6e8fae8437.jpg" alt="MacBook Air (left) vs. MacBook Pro (right)" title="MacBook Air (left) vs. MacBook Pro (right)" width="600" height="409" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>Personally, I did not perceive a big difference in “vibrancy”, so my choice was
clear: I’ll pick the MacBook Pro over the MacBook Air (despite the weight) for
the nano texture display!</p>
<p>After using the laptop in a number of situations, I am very happy with this
choice. In normal scenarios, I notice no reflections at all (where my previous
laptop did show reflections!). This includes using the laptop on a train (next
to the window), or using the laptop outside in daylight.</p>
<h2 id="specs-m4-or-m4-pro">Specs: M4 or M4 Pro?</h2>
<p>(When I chose the new laptop, Apple’s M4 chips were current. By now, they have
released the first devices with M5 chips.)</p>
<p>I decided to go with the MacBook Pro with M4 chip instead of the M4 <strong>Pro</strong> chip
because I don’t need the extra compute, and the M4 needs less cooling — the M4
Pro apparently runs hotter. This increases the chance of the fan staying off.</p>
<p>Here are the specs I ended up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>14" Liquid Retina XDR Display with nano texture</li>
<li>Apple M4 Chip (10 core CPU, 10 core GPU)</li>
<li>32 GB RAM (this is the maximum!), 2 TB SSD (enough for this computer)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>
<p>One thing I noticed is that the MacBook Pro M4 sometimes gets warm, even when it
is connected to power, but is suspended to RAM (and has been fully charged for
hours). I’m not sure why.</p>
<p>Luckily, the fan indeed stays silent. I think I might have heard it spin up once
in half a year or so?</p>
<p>The battery life is amazing! The previous MacBook Air M1 had amazing all-day
battery life already, and this MacBook Pro M4 lasts even longer. For example,
watching videos on a train ride (with VLC) for 3 hours consumed only 10% of
battery life. I generally never even carry the charger.</p>
<p>Because of that, Apple’s re-introduction of MagSafe, a magnetic power connector
(so you don’t damage the laptop when you trip over it), is nice-to-have but
doesn’t really make much of a difference anymore. In fact, it might be better to
pack a USB-C cable when traveling, as that makes you more flexible in how you
use the charger.</p>
<h2 id="120-hz-display">120 Hz display</h2>
<p>I was curious whether the 120 Hz display would make a difference in practice. I
mostly notice the increased refresh rate when there are animations, but not,
for example, when scrolling.</p>
<p>One surprising discovery (but obvious in retrospect) is that even non-animations
can become faster. For example, when running a Go web server on <code>localhost</code>, I
noticed that navigating between pages by clicking links felt faster on the 120
Hz display!</p>
<p>The following illustration shows why that is, using a page load that takes 6ms
of processing time. There are three cases (the illustration shows an average
case and the worst case):</p>
<ol>
<li>Best case: Page load finishes <em>just before</em> the next frame is displayed: no delay.</li>
<li>Worst case: Page load finishes <em>just after</em> a frame is displayed: one frame of delay.</li>
<li>Most page loads are somewhere in between. We’ll have 0.x to 1.0 frames of delay</li>
</ol>




<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-31-delay-60-vs-120.svg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-31-delay-60-vs-120.svg" alt="delay" title="delay" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>As you can see, the waiting time becomes shorter when going from 60 Hz (one
frame every 16.6ms) to 120 Hz (one frame every 8.3ms). So if you’re working with
a system that has &lt;8ms response times, you might observe actions completing (up
to) twice as fast!</p>
<p>I don’t notice going back to 60 Hz displays on computers. However, on phones,
where a lot more animations are a key part of the user experience, I think 120
Hz displays are more interesting.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>My ideal MacBook would probably be a MacBook Air, but with the nano-texture display! :)</p>
<p>I still don’t like macOS and would prefer to run Linux on this laptop. But
<a href="https://asahilinux.org/">Asahi Linux</a> still needs some work before it’s usable
for me (I need external display output, and M4 support). This doesn’t bother me
too much, though, as I don’t use this computer for serious work.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that transformers and LLMs fail catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset (DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large, real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.
