<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>The path to creative mastery begins with years of silence. Publish anyway.</p><hr><p>Most things take <em>forever</em> to bear fruit.</p>
<p>Even the most successful creators have spent years (if not decades) putting content out in obscurity. Just a complete total void. Youtube videos with 4 views. Newsletters with 3 subscribers. Podcasts with 10 listeners. Blogs with 6 readers. Songs with 4 downloads. No one but their parents and their spouse consuming their work. And sometimes not even that.</p>
<p>If you’re in it purely for the promised land of love, praise, followers, and fame from millions of people - it’s impossible to sustain. In every field, it takes years of practice, repetition, and “failed performances” before the first hit. In the worst case, artists go their entire life without ever receiving the praise they deserved. Look at Van Gogh - an incredible artist who died unappreciated &amp; broke, in a mental asylum. All of his fame came after his death.</p>
<hr>
<h3>So how do you keep going?</h3>
<p>How do you keep hitting that publish button, over and over again, knowing there’s no one on the other side?</p>
<p>I don’t know. I’m still trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>But I have come across a few frameworks and quotes that I’ve found useful, so I’m sharing them below.</p>
<hr>
<h3>1 — Do things you like, and sometimes the world will agree</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBATMZSVPOw&amp;t=1171s&amp;ab_channel=MyFirstMillion">interview between Shaan Puri and Mike Posner</a> is awesome. In it, Mike talks about his (seemingly) sudden rise to stardom, the rapid fall, and the slow climb back.</p>
<p>After writing music for 10 years — since the age of 6 — Mike’s single <em>Cooler Than Me</em> blew up. No one other than his mom had heard any of his previous songs. <em>Cooler Than Me</em> hit #6 on the Billboard Top 100 — while he was still in college at Duke.</p>
<p>Mike spent the next 7 years trying to chase the same hit, and every song ended up worse than the last. The chase pushed him into depression, drugs, a near-fatal snake bite, a walking journey across the US, and climbing Everest.</p>
<p>Ultimately, he came out with a much healthier attitude (that led to more hits).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do things that you like, and sometimes the world will agree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of chasing hits, Mike only produces music he likes.
Music he thinks is good.<br>
<!-- -->Music he’d listen to.<br>
<!-- -->Music that’s a hit for <strong>him</strong>.</p>
<p>And sometimes, the world agrees.</p>
<hr>
<h3>2 — Push yourself out</h3>
<p>Similar to Mike Posner’s mindset: Instead of trying to figure out <em>what your audience likes</em>, just create what <strong>you</strong> like.</p>
<p>That’ll help sustain motivation when your audience doesn’t really exist. You’ll be more likely to push through plateaus, and you’ll enjoy the process. You’ll also just produce <em>better</em> work.</p>
<p>Best of all? It’ll attract like-minded followers — people who love the work <em>you</em> like to create.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your audience is just <strong>you</strong>, pushed outwards.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>3 — Build your Binge Bank</h3>
<p>Instead of being disappointed when no one consumes your content, treat these initial pieces of content as an investment. An investment in your <strong>Binge Bank</strong>. What’s that?</p>
<p>Your Binge Bank is the collection of content that your <em>future</em> fans will want to consume. It’s the rabbit hole of content they'll go down. Your audience might not exist now, but when it does in the future (and you can bet it will), they’ll want to go back in time and see everything you’ve produced.</p>
<p>This is why YouTubers with millions of followers have hundreds of thousands of views on their first few videos. Those videos didn’t get any views when they were first published. They were revisited <em>after</em> they became famous, by their most loyal fans.</p>
<hr>
<p>So if you (like me) are publishing into obscurity, this is your gentle reminder.</p>
<p>Keep going.</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

See episode eight, which finds Jack battling a copy of himself — made from his own anger. Lingering shots of trees on fire, gorgeously painted, punctuate the fight.</span></p><p>Toward the end, Jack realizes that his emotions are out of control. We cut to a burning tree again, and the camera moves in closer, up to the bark. Then the flames stop, and the tree dissolves, and a calm waterfall appears. After almost a minute and 20 seconds of no talking (and no characters on screen), we snap to Jack’s face. Yet a story’s been told.</p><p><span>This stuff asked a lot of the kids in Cartoon Network’s audience. Tartakovsky was defiant about it. “I’ve always felt that kids are a lot smarter than we’ve given them credit for, but we’ve never given them a chance to figure things out as they’re watching television,” he said in one interview. Elsewhere: “as long as I can make films, I’ll always treat kids as adults and at the same intelligence level as I am.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-3-158580375" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p><span>The network execs gave him that freedom. Mike Lazzo greenlit the show’s loose, bare pitch over dinner. Linda Simensky explained, “Genndy had done such a good job up until that point — if there was anyone we could trust, it was Genndy.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-4-158580375" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span></p><p>In fact, she said, “[W]e were really just excited about the fact that it was so different and so unusual.”</p><p><span>Tartakovsky’s team put together a test for </span><em>Samurai Jack</em><span> (</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0g8zOF7RCQ" rel="">watch</a><span>), animated by the outsource crew in Korea. The higher-ups didn’t </span><em>request</em><span> a test, but Tartakovsky wanted proof. “[I]t came back. And it </span><em>worked</em><span>,” he remembered. Two minutes of wordless action and atmosphere held up. Something similar happened with episode one:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>… luckily for us, the overseas </em><span>[team]</span><em> did an amazing job, and the first episode came back, and I remember being like, “Wow. There’s something here.” ... And the first episode was so silent, too, ‘cause we had that whole flashback sequence ... Mike Lazzo and Linda Simensky ... </em><span>[go in to watch it]</span><em>, and then you’re sitting in this little editing office … and it’s complete silence. ... I’m looking at them, and they don’t have any expression on their faces. And I go, “Wow.” Then I start sweating.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>He figured the show was dead — but the execs were fascinated. “Speechless” was the word Lazzo used.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-5-158580375" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span> This huge, costly experiment in visual storytelling went ahead.</span></p><p><span>Tartakovsky credits a lot of </span><em>Samurai Jack</em><span>’s success to art director Scott Wills. “It really came together when [he] came aboard. ‘Cause when Scott started to paint, all of a sudden, we had lighting, we had mood and atmosphere,” he said in the 2000s.</span></p><p><span>These things were critical for the show. Again: images couldn’t carry without depth and richness. Tartakovsky was looking at live-action movies from the ‘60s and ‘70s — </span><em>Doctor Zhivago</em><span>, </span><em>Lawrence of Arabia</em><span>, Kurosawa films.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-6-158580375" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span><span> Another main influence was Hayao Miyazaki’s work. As Tartakovsky said, films like these:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>… really made the background a character. ... It all kind of came down to filmmaking with me. Because usually we are drawing these backgrounds and they’ll just get a pan and then we’ll just go to the next sequence. I wanted to do, maybe, a minute or two sequence of just establishing the environment. You really get to feel where Jack is … It’s like watching </em><span>Lawrence of Arabia</span><em>, you really </em><span>feel</span><em> that desert. And it’s a really cool feeling and so I thought, “Ah, how much cooler would you feel if you’re looking at these great drawings with this really unique color and a great mood?”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>He wanted to treat background paintings like classic movies treat landscapes — which wasn’t </span><em>done</em><span> on American television. But </span><em>Samurai Jack</em><span> did it. And Wills’ painting techniques (which we covered </span><a href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/i/162725246/painting-the-samurai-jack-way" rel="">in a recent issue</a><span>) made it possible.</span></p><p>The style was unique. Wills took from mid-century cartoons — the abstract geometry and color — and blended them with other things. He wanted to “combine everything that’s good about realistic painting and feature [animation] painting, and everything that’s good about [UPA-type] stylization,” he said. The idea was to “have cinematic lighting, with mood and depth, but at the same time have it feel stylized.”</p><p><span>For the backgrounds to remain engaging across the series, freshness mattered: there were frequent new locations and surprising color choices. “We’d have … a rule: no green grass, no blue sky,” Tartakovsky recalled.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-7-158580375" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3807719,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://animationobsessive.substack.com/i/158580375?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Stills from </span><em>Samurai Jack</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>And all of this stuff had to be handled delicately, for technical reasons. </p><p><em>Samurai Jack</em><span> doesn’t use black outlines for its characters.

            <guid>44150803</guid>
            <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 13:42:49 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://stefan-gloor.ch/yomani-hack">https://stefan-gloor.ch/yomani-hack</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44150803">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>In this project, I started to reverse engineer payment card
        terminals because they seemed to be an interesting target for security
        research, given the high stakes involved. Although I initially didn’t
        knew much about this industry, I did expect a ton of security features
        and a very security-hardened device. And to some degree, this was also
        correct.</p>
        <h2>First Look</h2>
        <p>The model I went with is a Worldline Yomani XR terminal. Although it
        seems to be discontinued at the time of writing, this is the model that
        is <i>everywhere</i> in Switzerland. From big grocery chains to the
        small repair shop on the corner, everyone has one or a whole fleet of
        this exact terminal.</p>
        <p>After booting it up and aimlessly clicking through the UI, I did a
        quick port scan, but couldn’t find anything interesting. So naturally,
        I started to take it apart.</p>
        <div>
          <figure>
            <a href="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_pcb.jpg"><img src="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_pcb.jpg" width="100%" alt="Picture of the main PCB of the Yomani XR terminal with annotation of different board components."></a>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>The housing and the PCBs appear to be well-made. The design consists
        of multiple PCBs: a small connector board for the outward-facing
        connectors, the main board, and a vertical board the card slot sits on.
        The main SoC seems to be a custom ASIC, a dual-core Arm processor
        code-named “Samoa II” in the firmware, but I am jumping ahead.
        According to Worldline documentation, this seems to indeed be a custom
        ASIC, rather than just a rebranded off-the-shelf chip. Next to it,
        there is a small external flash and RAM.</p>
        <h2>Tamper Protections</h2>
        <p>During disassembly, I kept looking for a tamper switch that would
        detect when the device’s housing was opened, like I had seen previously
        on laptops and other devices. However, I couldn’t find such a switch.
        Rather, they use the board-to-board interconnects as a way of detecting
        when the device is opened. Because they use relatively
        pressure-sensitive Zebra strips between the boards, they have to be
        tightly screwed together. Even unscrewing some of the screws is enough
        to break contact and trigger a tamper event. Of course, the tamper
        detection must also work when the power is disconnected, so that’s the
        purpose of the coin cell battery.</p>
        <p>But this is not all in terms of tamper resistance: The “vulnerable”
        PCBs are covered by zick-zack traces that act as a tamper detection
        mechanism. Accidentally breaking a single copper trace during a
        physical penetration attempt (hole drill etc.) is enough to trigger the
        tamper detection.</p>
        <div>
          <figure>

            <figcaption>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>The card slot itself is contained in an additional, internal
        housing. Wrapped around this housing, there is a flex PCB acting as
        tamper protection.</p>
        <div>
          <figure>
            <a href="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_mesh.jpg"><img src="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_mesh.jpg" width="100%" alt="Inner plastic housing is wrapped in a flex PCB with zick zack traces, acting as a temper detection mechanism."></a>
            <figcaption>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>After putting the device back together, it was clear that my
        intrusion had not gone undetected. Sure enough, the device would now
        only show a big red screen screaming “TAMPER DETECTED”. In this mode,
        the device seems to be fully unresponsive to any kind of external
        input. So, game over?</p>

        <h2>Chip-Off Firmware Extraction</h2>
        <p>Since any “runtime” exploration seems to be futile now, I wanted to
        take a look a the firmware. For this, I desoldered the on-board flash
        chip, soldered some wires to it in “dead bug” style and proceeded to
        dump the contents.</p>
        <div>
          <figure>
            <a href="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_chipoff.jpg"><img src="https://stefan-gloor.ch/img/yomani_chipoff.jpg" width="100%" alt="Flash chip in BGA housing mounted upside-down on a perfboard. Thin copper wires are connected from the chip’s contacts to a flash reader."></a>
            <figcaption>
              BGA flash chip of the card terminal desoldered and connected to a
              flash reader.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>To my surprise, the contents seemed to be entirely unencrypted!
        However, the contents seemed to have a strange ECC layout. Instead of
        following the flash chip’s inherent page layout and putting the ECC
        data in the interleaved spare areas, it appeared as if the some ECC
        data was present in the page and some clear text was in the spare
        areas. With the help of some friends, I figured out the layout: instead
        of using the standard 2048 byte payload + 64 byte ECC/spare layout, it
        uses 3x 694 byte chunks of data each followed by 10 ECC bytes. The ECC
        bytes do not appear to be all used. Instead, the last 16 bytes of the
        spare area seem to act as metadata for the YAFFS2 file system. Now
        normally, there are less ECC bytes per page and therefore the usable
        metadata area for the filesystem is larger than 16 bytes. For this
        reason, the YAFFS2 filesystem had to be patched to work with smaller
        metadata structures.</p>
        <p>I implemented a compatible filesystem reader and with it, I could
        successfully dump the filesystem contents!</p>
        
        <p>Now it was clear that this device runs Linux. I found a standard
        Linux filesystem with a lot of interesting files to browse through. The
        system runs a 3.6 kernel, built with Buildroot 2010.02 (!) in February
        of 2023. The system seems to use a custom bootloader, “Booter v1.7”.
        Although I don’t know how recent the firware version was that I ended
        up dumping, it must have been released after February 2023. So finding
        such an ancient kernel is rather concerning. Userspace-wise, the system
        uses classy init scripts, busybox, and uClibc (final release was 13
        years ago). libcrypt has version 0.9.26, ouch.</p>
        <h2>Finding a Root Shell on Accident</h2>
        <p>Having seen the firmware gave me some new confidence that there
        might be more stuff to find. So I reattached the flash chip using
        wires, ignoring everything I know about signal integrity. To my
        surprise the device booted up again (showing the tamper message).</p>

        <p>My next goal was it to find the serial console of the Linux system.
        Surely, it must have one for debugging. By looking at a boot log, I
        might get some more valuable information. So, equipped with a logic
        analyzer, I started poking.</p>

samoa login: 
</pre>
        <p>It even shows a login prompt, neat! So this is definitely the Linux
        boot log. Many embedded Linux systems will have such a more or less
        exposed serial console, but most of the time the login is disabled
        altogether or a random, hard-to-crack password is either hard-coded or
        generated at boot. Not expecting much, just out of curiosity, I entered
        “root” as the login, and...</p>
        <pre>samoa login: root
~ #
</pre>
        <p>Wait, what!? That’s it? I’m in?</p>
        <p>Well, yes. That was the boring story of how I got the root shell. It
        is just there, exposed. No sophisticated exploit chain, no brute-force
        password cracking required. Additionally, everything seems to still
        work although the device still shows the tamper message.</p>
        <p>Now you may say: well okay, that’s not ideal, but in order to get
        access to the exposed root shell, you need to open up the device, which
        triggers the tamper protection and effectively renders the device
        useless. But in fact, the <b>serial port is accessible from the
        outside!</b>. Without opening up the device and triggering the tamper
        protection, the debug connector can be accessed through a little hatch
        on the back of the device. All an attacker needs is just 30 seconds
        alone with the device to attach to the serial port, log in, deploy
        malware, and leave. This sounds really bad.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Actually, no. Hear me out: During my analysis of this device, it
          became clear that the Linux system is not the whole story. For
          example, there seems to be no graphics driver for the display and the
          only framebuffer device does not seem to do anything. Instead, only
          text strings seem to be passed to a binary
          (<code>display_tool</code>), that issues some inter-processor
          messages. The same goes for the key pad or the card reader itself. I
          could not find any evidence that these peripherals could be accessed
          directly from Linux.</p>
          <p>Instead, there is an entirely separate processor, refered to as
          <code>mp1</code>, that seems to handle all the “secure” stuff, like
          handling the card, getting the pin and showing information on the
          screen. The “insecure” Linux, running on the second processor,
          <code>mp2</code>, only handles the networking, the updating, and the
          business logic.</p>
          <p>The Linux core seems to always boot, regardless of the tamper
          state. From there, the secure core is booted. For this, Linux
          apparently loads a secure bootloader (named <code>loadercode</code>)
          into memory. This loadercode checks whether the tamper protections
          have been triggered and based on the result, either show the red
          screen or continue to boot the actual “secure” image
          (<code>mp1.img</code>, in the Linux filesystem). This secure image
          seems to be properly encrypted and signed by two entities.</p>

                always boots Linux, which in turn loads a secure bootloader and
                the secure image on the second core. The loadercode is what
                displays the tamper messages on screen. The secure image, that
                handles the card, display, and key pad, is properly encrypted
                and signed.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>While concerning, the exposed root shell does not seem to be as
          big of a risk as initially feared.
			While still being a huge unnecessary attack surface, and a massive oversight from the engineers in my opinion,
			I could not find any evidence that sensitive data, such as card details, could become compromised this way.
			Also, I could not definitively proof which firmware versions were vulnerable. During my research, I also encountered devices that
			had a disabled root login. My guess is that somehow this debug feature accidentally made it into production firmware at some point.
			Chances are that this was discovered and fixed internally before I reported it to the manufacturer (as I had no way of updating the firmware,
			or verifying that I was running the latest firmware).</p>
			<p>
			This project was a lot of fun and I wish I had some more time to dig deeper into the firmware and explore more possibilities.
			If you want to take on this challenge, feel free to reach out to me.
			I’d like to thank anyone involved in this project for their valuable input.

   <p>KYIV, Ukraine — A Ukrainian drone attack has destroyed more than 40 Russian planes deep in Russia's territory, a Ukrainian security official told The Associated Press on Sunday, while Russia pounded Ukraine with missiles and drones a day before the two sides meet for a new round of direct talks in Istanbul.</p>   <p>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose operational details, said the attack took over 1 1/2-year to execute and was personally supervised by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>   <p>The operation saw drones transported in containers carried by trucks deep into Russian territory, he said. The drones hit airfields including the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk region, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) from Ukraine. It is the first time that a Ukrainian drone has been seen in the region, local Gov. Igor Kobzeva said, stressing that it did not present a threat to civilians.</p>   
   <p>The attack was disclosed on the same day as Zelenskyy said Ukraine will send a delegation to Istanbul for a new round of direct peace talks with Russia on Monday.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5419509-100" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>In a statement on Telegram, Zelenskyy said that Defense Minister Rustem Umerov will lead the Ukrainian delegation. "We are doing everything to protect our independence, our state and our people," Zelenskyy said.</p>   <p>Ukrainian officials had previously called on the Kremlin to provide a promised memorandum setting out its position on ending the war before the meeting takes place. Moscow had said it would share its memorandum during the talks.</p>   <h2>Russian strike hits an army unit</h2>   <p>Russia on Sunday launched the biggest number of drones — 472 — on Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine's air force said.</p>   <p>Russian forces also launched seven missiles alongside the barrage of drones, said Yuriy Ignat, head of communications for the air force. Earlier Sunday, Ukraine's army said at least 12 Ukrainian service members were killed and more than 60 were injured in a Russian missile strike on an army training unit.</p>   <p>The strike occurred at 12:50 p.m., the statement said, emphasizing that no formations or mass gatherings of personnel were being held at the time. An investigative commission was created to uncover the circumstances around the attack that led to such a loss in personnel, the statement said.</p>   
   <p>The training unit is located to the rear of the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) active front line, where Russian reconnaissance and strike drones are able to strike.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5419509-101" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Ukraine's forces suffer from manpower shortages and take extra precautions to avoid mass gatherings as the skies across the front line are saturated with Russian drones looking for targets.</p>   <p>"If it is established that the actions or inaction of officials led to the death or injury of servicemen, those responsible will be held strictly accountable," the Ukrainian Ground Forces' statement said.</p>   <h2>Northern pressure</h2>   <p>Russia's Ministry of Defense said Sunday that it had taken control of the village of Oleksiivka in Ukraine's northern Sumy region. Ukrainian authorities in Sumy ordered mandatory evacuations in 11 more settlements Saturday as Russian forces make steady gains in the area.</p>   <p>Speaking Saturday, Ukraine's top army chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said that Russian forces were focusing their main offensive efforts on Pokrovsk, Toretsk and Lyman in the Donetsk region, as well as the Sumy border area.</p>

Sadly it retained the rather large key sizes of the earlier ST models, making typos too easy. It also had the connection for the mouse and joystick under the keyboard, which kept things neat and tidy but was a major pain to connect in the first place. The low profile of the case also meant that the disk drive slot would bump into the keyboard if the two were close together.</p><p><span>Overall, I’d say the keyboard is a solid B+ and it is a sought-after keyboard today for its reliability. This keyboard also </span><a href="https://www.goto10retro.com/p/10-secrets-of-the-atari-mega-ste" rel="">works great with the Mega STE</a><span> and I’d love to get my hands on one.</span></p><p>Other case differences include a built-in fan and a built-in battery-backed clock that ran on simple AA batteries. The fan was probably not really needed, but it likely improved reliability.</p><p>As far as technical specifications, the Mega ST did not have many advantages over a standard 1040ST. Its main improvement was that it had a blitter chip that could move data in memory around fast, which was great for graphics processing.  The Mega ST was the first to include TOS 1.02, which was the first update to TOS in ROM and included several bug fixes.</p><p><span>Perhaps the biggest “innovation” was the RAM. The Mega ST was available with 2MB or 4MB of RAM</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-159691277" href="https://www.goto10retro.com/p/atari-means-business-with-the-mega#footnote-1-159691277" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>, an enormous amount in 1987. This much RAM was a game-changer for developers and desktop publishing.</span></p><p>Lastly there was an internal bus connector slot, which ended up not really being all that important. The only thing I know that used it were some hard drive kits that would provide a way to squeeze the hard drive inside the Mega ST case. This points out a problem in the case design: it was just too short and didn’t have much room for anything else to be in there.</p><p>It would have made sense for Atari to sell an internal hard drive upgrade for the Mega ST, but instead they sold a separate external hard drive, the MegaFile, that you could place under the Mega ST. Modular perhaps, but more expensive and messier than an internal solution that would also not have external cables or a power supply.</p><p>By far the biggest technical limitation was that the Mega ST ran at the same speed at the 520ST and 1040ST: 8Mhz. The blitter certainly could speed up the display operations of some apps, but the Mega ST basically ran everything at the same speed as the older and much cheaper STs.</p><p>The Mega ST was often promoted in combination with the SLM804 Laser Printer as a complete desktop publishing solution for just $3000 to $4000. At the time this was touted as a full system at the same price as just the laser printer for a Macintosh.</p><p>I don’t recall seeing Atari specifically market the Mega ST to developers, but I suspect a lot of developers found the better keyboard and extra RAM to be worth the upgrade.</p><p><span>In general, I think Atari had a tough time selling such an expensive product</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-159691277" href="https://www.goto10retro.com/p/atari-means-business-with-the-mega#footnote-2-159691277" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>. Even in 1987, the Atari brand was closely associated with video games and inexpensive computers. Trying to use the Atari brand for more expensive computers aimed at businesses was always going to be difficult. After all, many business would definitely balk at having the Atari label on their desks.</span></p><p>Although I never owned a Mega ST, my Dad did have a Mega ST 2. Since he also had the SC1224 color monitor, I would sometimes use it to play games. I remember hogging his Mega ST to play Dungeon Master quite often. I also remember that the keyboard was really nice and miles better than the one on my 1040ST. He also had an external hard drive, which he was able to place under the Mega ST.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg" width="1042" height="754" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/af783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:754,&quot;width&quot;:1042,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:221734,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.goto10retro.com/i/159691277?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf783d8d-e65e-4c39-a797-65bc36c43eab_1042x754.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>My Dad’s Mega ST2 setup from the early 90s</figcaption></figure></div><p>The Mega ST was not a huge success for Atari. Although it was announced in early 1987, systems did not start shipping until late 1987 with most not shipping until 1988. The problem was the extra RAM. The Mega ST used 1Mbit DRAM, which actually had a significant price increase and shortage due to tariffs on overseas DRAM. This pricing problem affected the computer industry as a whole, but definitely hit Atari hard with its low margins.</p><p>It was about this time that Atari seemed to focus more on the European market, sending more product there instead of the US.</p><p><span>The Mega ST was eventually replaced by the </span><a href="https://www.goto10retro.com/p/finding-a-mega-ste" rel="">Mega STE</a><span> in 1991/1992. Looking back, I think everyone would have wanted to see something like the Mega STE in 1988, but that just wasn’t meant to be.</span></p><p>The Mega ST takes up a lot of space on a desk, is not easily upgradable and is no faster than a standard 1040ST. </p><p><span>I have a </span><a href="https://www.goto10retro.com/p/finding-a-mega-ste" rel="">Mega STE</a><span> and I prefer it in every way over a Mega ST, except perhaps the keyboard. So other than the keyboard, I don’t think Mega ST computer are in high demand today.</span></p><p><span>For more about the Mega ST, check out the review in </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/ST_Log_Magazine_Issue_18/page/n66/mode/1up" rel="">ST Log #18 (April 1988)</a><span>:</span></p></div></div>]]></description>
